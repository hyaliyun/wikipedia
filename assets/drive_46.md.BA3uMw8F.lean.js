Gourmo Abdoul LÔ. 17 August 2007. History The party has its roots in the Kadihine (Arabic: \\"toiler\\", \\"worker\\") movement of the Mauritanian 1960s and 1970s, with its organization, the Parti Kadihine Mauritanien (PKM) working as a clandestine socialist and anti-colonial oppositional group against the single-party rule of Mokhtar Ould Daddah. The party was composed mostly of Moorish Arab Mauritanians, although it was opposed to the prevailing racial and ethno-social discrimination, and subsumed an important faction of Black African opposition politicians inside its organization. After 1969, the party mended its relations with Ould Daddah after he took several steps to the left, nationalizing the mining industry MIFERMA (today's SNIM) in Zouérat, loosening his strong ties with the former colonial power France, and took other measures to strengthen Mauritania's international anticolonial profile. The PKM then divided between a group which agreed to join Ould Daddah's ruling party, the PPM, as a leftist intra-party opposition; and another group which was more reluctant to cooperate with the authorities, and reorganized in new opposition movements, primarily the Mouvement Nationale Démocratique (MND). When Mauritania invaded Western Sahara in 1975 to establish a Greater Mauritania, in collaboration with Morocco, the Kadihines again took a strong stance against the regime, and in favor of Sahrawi self-determination and the Polisario Front (with which the UFP retains strong relations even today). After the 1978 coup d'état, the movement lost much influence, as politics moved over into the military sphere. The modern UFP began as a faction of the Union of Democratic Forces-New Era (UFD). At an extraordinary party congress called by this faction in August 1998, it elected MND leader Mohamed Ould Maouloud as its president, and this caused a split in the party. The opposing faction, led by Ahmed Ould Daddah, was dubbed the UFD/A, while Maouloud's faction was dubbed the UFD/B. The latter faction participated in the January 1999 local election, which was boycotted by the former. In late 2000, the UFD/A was dissolved by the government, and the UFD/B changed its own name in solidarity, now calling itself the Union of the Forces of Progress.History of the UFP at the party's web site .

The party was founded in 1998 based on a platform committed to the establishment of a civil state, access of all political parties to the media, the separation of the Mauritanian state and the Democratic and Social Republican Party of President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, and the creation of a national unity government chaired by the opposition. The front was initially mainly distinguished by its policy of non-participation in elections under the Taya government. Party leader Mohamed Lemine Ch'bih Ould Cheikh Melainine was arrested on 8 April 2001 along with two other party members, Mukhtar Ould Haibetna and Bouba Ould Hassan, on grounds of conspiracy to commit acts of sabotage and terrorism in Mauritania. The government alleged the trio to have been acting in collusion with the Libyan government of Muammar al-Gaddafi. The three were tried in a criminal court some 850 kilometers from Noukachott, and each received a sentence of five years imprisonment. The sentence was met with surprise from many observers, who had expected the three to be acquitted. The defense team argued that the trial was deeply flawed, and that the confessions from their clients had been obtained as a result of an interrogation during which they had been drugged by the Mauritanian police. The party went on to contest the legislative elections in October 2001, winning one seat. Following the removal of Taya from office the party competed in the 2006 elections, winning 1 out of 95 seats.

JTF-GTMO falls under US Southern Command. Since January 2002 the command has operated the Guantanamo Bay detention camps Camp X-Ray and its successors Camp Delta, Camp V, and Camp Echo, where detained prisoners are held who have been captured in the war in Afghanistan and elsewhere since the September 11, 2001 attacks. From the command's founding in 2002 to early 2017, the detainee population has been reduced from 779 to 41. As of May 2019, the unit is under the command of U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Timothy C. Kuehhas. History In 1992, the United States established Operation Sea Signal to prepare for a mass migration of refugees from Haiti and Cuba.JTF-GTMO, Joint Task Force Guantanamo Timeline , accessed May 2010 In 1994, Operation Sea Signal led to the creation of Joint Task Force 160. JTF 160 was responsible for housing and processing more than 40,000 migrants awaiting repatriation or parole to the United States. Camp X-Ray was established to segregate migrants who had committed crimes, such as theft, assault and battery, prostitution and black-market activities, from other migrants and from U.S. civilians and military personnel at Guantanamo. In 1996, Operation Sea Signal came to an end and the military abandoned Camp X-Ray. In December 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks and the United States intervention in Afghanistan, Joint Task Force 160 was reactivated. Camp X-Ray was prepared as a temporary location for the detention of people captured in Afghanistan who were believed to be part of the Taliban or al-Qaeda, neither of which the United States recognized as legal governments. In January 2002, the first detainees were transferred to Guantanamo Bay and housed in Camp X-Ray. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had its first visit to the facility six days later. The ICRC has continued quarterly visits up to 2010. Detention facilities In April 2002, construction of the new 410-bed Camp Delta (Camps 1, 2, 3) was completed. The detainees were moved from Camp X-Ray to Camp Delta that month. In November 2002, Joint Task Force 160 and 170 were merged to create Joint Task Force Guantanamo. By 2007 original Camp Delta compound was supplemented by Camps 4, 5 and 6. Camp 4, opened in February 2003, featured communal style living areas, similar to a military barracks, and was used to house \\"compliant\\" detainees. Camp 5, opened in May 2004, had segregated housing units (i.e. solitary cells) for detainees who are uncompliant or who pose a threat to other detainees or Joint Task Force staff members. Camp 5 was closed in 2016 when the total detainee population was reduced to 61. Camp 6, opened in November 2006, is patterned after a medium security prison with \\"pods\\" housing 10 to 20 detainees with individual cells but sharing a common living area. Camp 6 houses the \\"general population\\". As of late 2016, almost all detainees were housed in Camp 6. Status of detainees The status of these detainees is disputed. The United States government defines them as enemy combatants, claiming their status was not that of a prisoner of war as recognized under the Geneva Conventions (due to not being affiliated with any government, being alleged members of Al Qaida or groups affiliated with them). In Rasul v Bush (2004), the Supreme Court held that the detainees had the right to counsel and to challenge their detentions at an impartial tribunal, according to habeas corpus. On June 29, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that they had the minimal protection of Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions in that detainees must be housed and treated humanely, and that they had the right to an impartial tribunal to hear charges against them. It said the military tribunals as established by the Dept. of Defense did not have sufficient authority, and Congress needed to authorize any system outside the established US civil and military justice systems. In Boumediene v. Bush (2008), the Supreme Court held that the detainees' right to habeas corpus could not be taken away by the Military Commission Act of 2006, which they ruled was unconstitutional. In addition, the Supreme Court held that detainees had the right to access federal courts to hear their habeas corpus challenges. Some of the cases are proceeding through the federal court system. Intelligence task forces In February 2002, Joint Task Force 170 was created as the intelligence task force to work side by side with Joint Task Force 160. At a later date, JTF 170 was re-designated as the Joint Intelligence Group and was assigned as a subordinate element of Joint Task Force Guantanamo. The other subordinate elements of JTF GTMO are the Joint Detention Group and the Joint Medical Group. Joint Detention Group The Joint Detention Group is one of the components of the Task Force. It is the organization assigned to guarding the captives, and maintaining camp security. The guards within the Joint Detention Group come from the United States Army and the United States Navy. In 2009, guards outnumbered prisoners in Guantanamo by more than five to one. With the acceleration of detainee releases from 2009 to the early 2010s, this ration increased greatly. The officers commanding the Joint Detention Group, also known as the warden, have included: *Colonel Adolph McQueen, 2002 *Colonel Michael Bumgarner, 2006 *Colonel Bruce Vargo, 2008–2010 *Colonel Donnie Thomas, 2010–2012 *Colonel John Bogdan, 2012–2014 *Colonel David Heath, 2014–2016Joint Detention Group Change of Command JTF GTMO Public Affairs.

J. Cronin, first published in 1937, which was groundbreaking in its treatment of the contentious theme of medical ethics. It has been credited with laying the foundation in Great Britain for the introduction of the NHS a decade later. In the United States, it won the National Book Award for 1937 novels, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. \\"Booksellers Give Prize to 'Citadel': Cronin's Work About Doctors Their Favorite--'Mme. Curie' Gets Non-Fiction Award ...\\", The New York Times, 2 March 1938, page 14. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007). Ballots were submitted by 319 stores; there had been about 600 ABA members one year earlier. • At the Hotel Astor luncheon, presenter Clifton Fadiman said: \\"Unlike the Pulitzer Prize committee, the booksellers merely vote for their favorite books. They do not say it is the best book or the one that will elevate the standard of manhood or womanhood. Twenty years from now we can decide which are the masterpieces. This year we can only decide which books we enjoyed reading the most.\\" For his fifth book, Dr. Cronin drew on his experiences practising medicine in the coal mining communities of the South Wales Valleys, as he had for The Stars Look Down two years earlier. Specifically, he had researched and reported on the correlation between coal dust inhalation and lung disease in the town of Tredegar. He had also worked as a doctor for the Tredegar Medical Aid Society at the Cottage Hospital, which served as the model for the National Health Service. Cronin once stated in an interview, \\"I have written in The Citadel all I feel about the medical profession, its injustices, its hide-bound unscientific stubbornness, its humbug ... The horrors and inequities detailed in the story I have personally witnessed. This is not an attack against individuals, but against a system.\\"  Plot summary  In October 1924, Andrew Manson, an idealistic, newly qualified doctor, arrives from Scotland to work as assistant to Doctor Page in the small (fictitious) Welsh mining town of Drineffy (Blaenelly is the name given in some adaptations). He quickly realises that Page is unwell and disabled and that he has to do all the work for a meagre wage. Shocked by the unsanitary conditions he discovers, Manson works to improve matters and receives the support of Dr Philip Denny, a cynical semi-alcoholic who, Manson finds out in due course, took a post as an assistant doctor after having fallen from grace as a surgeon. Resigning, he obtains a post as assistant in a miners' medical aid scheme in 'Aberalaw', a neighbouring coal mining town in the South Wales coalfield. On the strength of this job, Manson marries Christine Barlow, a junior school teacher. Christine helps her husband with his silicosis research. Eager to improve the lives of his patients, mainly coal miners, Manson dedicates many hours to research in his chosen field of lung disease. He studies for, and is granted, the MRCP, and when his research is published, an MD. The research gains him a post with the 'Mines Fatigue Board' in London, but he resigns after six months to set up a private practice. Seduced by the thought of easy money from wealthy clients rather than the principles he started out with, Manson becomes involved with pampered private patients and fashionable surgeons and drifts away from his wife. A patient dies because of a surgeon's ineptitude, and the incident causes Manson to abandon his practice and return to his principles. He and his wife repair their damaged relationship, but then she is run over by a bus and killed. Since Manson has accused the incompetent surgeon of murder, he is vindictively reported to the General Medical Council for having worked with an American tuberculosis specialist, Richard Stillman, who does not have a medical degree, even though the patient had been successfully treated at his clinic. Stillman's treatment, that of pneumothorax involved collapsing an affected lung with nitrogen, and was not universally accepted at the time. Despite his lawyer's gloomy prognosis, Manson forcefully justifies his actions during the hearing and is not struck off the medical register. Historical context The novel is of interest because of its portrayal of a voluntary contribution medical association which is based (not entirely uncritically) on the Tredegar Medical Aid Society for which Cronin worked for a time in the 1920s, and which in due course became the inspiration for the National Health Service as established under Aneurin Bevan. The Citadel was extremely popular in translation, being sold in book shops in the Third Reich as late as 1944. Scholar and Holocaust survivor Victor Klemperer noted, “English novels are banned of course; but there are books by A.J. Cronin in every shop window: he’s Scottish and exposes shortcomings of social and public services in England.” After World War II, it proved popular in Communist bloc countries as well, where Cronin was one of the few contemporary British authors to be published. Adaptations The novel was made into a 1938 film with Robert Donat, Rosalind Russell, Ralph Richardson and Rex Harrison, and television versions include one American (1960), two British (1960 & 1983), and two Italian (1964 & 2003) adaptations of the novel. There are also three film adaptations of the novel in Indian languages: Tere Mere Sapne (1971) in Hindi, Jiban Saikate (1972) in Bengali and Madhura Swapnam (1982) in Telugu. In 2017 an adaptation for radio by Christopher Reason was featured as the BBC Radio 4 15 minute drama.

It is the southern terminus of the Ashmont–Mattapan High Speed Line, part of the Red Line, and is also an important MBTA bus transfer station, with ten routes terminating there. It is located at Mattapan Square in the Mattapan neighborhood. At the station, trolleys use a balloon loop to reverse direction back to Ashmont station. Mattapan station is fully accessible, with mini-high platforms for boarding trolleys.  History  Mattapan station before the 2006–2007 renovation The Ashmont–Mattapan Line follows the right-of-way of the Dorchester and Milton Branch Railroad, which opened to Mattapan in December 1847. The line was converted to an interurban-style trolley line in the 1920s, with the final section to Mattapan opening on December 21, 1929. The stone depot building, now a restaurant, stands adjacent in Mattapan Square. On May 5, 2006, the MBTA awarded a $6.2 million contract to replace the 1929-built station. The MBTA closed the line on June 24 to allow a new viaduct to be constructed at Ashmont station. During the closure, all stations on the line were modernized and (except for Valley Road) made handicapped accessible. The decrepit 1929-built shelter and old platforms were replaced by modern platforms with canopies; a new building for MBTA police and bus operations with a community room was built. Trolley service resumed on December 22, 2007. In 2014, the MBTA proposed to make $500,000 in additional renovations to the station. These included upgraded shelters and heating in passenger waiting areas, pedestrian improvements, improved signage, and bicycle storage. =Transit-oriented development= Mattapan parking lot in March 2016 As part of the first round of modernization, the MBTA began planning for mixed-use transit-oriented development (TOD) to be built on the underused station parking lot. The planned development was not built, even after a second request for proposals was issued in 2012. In July 2014, a local charter school announced plans to build a new building on the site, despite calls for a third RFP to be issued to attract TOD instead. In January 2015, after opposition from local officials about the school's $1.5 million offer, the MBTA announced it would instead issue a third RFP that March. The third RFP was issued in November 2015. In July 2016, the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board selected the winner from two proposals for the property. The winning bidder, POAH/Nuestra, will pay the MBTA $4.89 million over the first 20 years of a 99-year lease of the site, upon which they will build 135 rental units and of ground-floor retail. 50 parking spaces will be reserved for MBTA riders. The project was approved by the city in 2018; , construction was to start in 2020.  Bus connections  The north busway at Mattapan station Mattapan serves as a major transfer station for MBTA bus operations, with nine routes converging on Mattapan Square from six directions. Six routes use the busway located on the north side of the station, while routes 28, 29, and 31 use a bus loop on the south side. *: Wakefield Avenue & Truman Parkway–Mattapan station *: Mattapan station– *: Mattapan station– *: Mattapan station– *: Mattapan station– via Cummins Highway and Roslindale Square *: Mattapan station–Forest Hills station via Morton Street *: River Street & Milton Street–Mattapan station *: –Mattapan station *: Cobbs Corner–Mattapan station Mattapan is also the origin point for the Mattapan– route.

She was prominent in producing art and animation for The Walt Disney Company, drawing concept art for such films as Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Song of the South and Cinderella.. Blair also created character designs for enduring attractions such as Disneyland's It's a Small World, the fiesta scene in El Rio del Tiempo in the Mexico pavilion in Epcot's World Showcase, and an enormous mosaic inside Disney's Contemporary Resort. Several of her illustrated children's books from the 1950s remain in print, such as I Can Fly by Ruth Krauss. Blair was inducted into the group of Disney Legends in 1991. Early life Born on October 21, 1911, in McAlester, Oklahoma, Mary Browne Robinson moved to Texas while still a small child, and later to the city of Morgan Hill, California in the early 20s. After graduating from San Jose State University which she attended from 1929 to 1931, Mary won a scholarship to the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, where artists such as Pruett Carter, Morgan Russell and Lawrence Murphy were among the teachers. She graduated from Chouinard in 1933. In 1934 shortly after college, she married another artist, Lee Everett Blair (October 1, 1911 - April 19, 1993). She was the sister-in-law of animator Preston Blair (1908–1995). Along with her husband Lee, she became a member of the California School of Watercolor and quickly became known for being an imaginative colorist and designer. Blair, Mary (1941), Street Market Card, South America Career Blair's first professional job in the animation industry was as an animator with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She would soon leave and join Lee Blair at the Ub Iwerks studio before moving to Disney. In the 1930s she was also a part of the innovative California Water-Color Society. Blair joined Walt Disney Animation Studios—initially with some reluctance— in 1940, and worked briefly on art for Dumbo, an early version of Lady and the Tramp, and a second version of Fantasia titled \\"Baby Ballet\\" which was not released until the late 1990s. After leaving the studio for a short time in 1941, Blair travelled to various South American countries with Walt Disney, Lillian Disney and other artists on a research tour. as part of the Good Neighbor policy of the President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Her watercolors impressed Disney, who appointed her as an art supervisor for the animated feature films Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros. Blair first began animation and color design on major films in 1943 and would continue to work on animated films for Disney for a full decade. Her work with animation did not end there however as after that, she worked on several package films, excluding Fun and Fancy Free, and on two partially animated features—Song of the South and So Dear to My Heart. The early 1950s were a busy time for the Disney studio, with an animated feature released nearly every year. Mary Blair was credited with color styling on Cinderella (1950), Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953), and the artistic influence of her concept art is strongly felt in those films, as well as in several animated shorts, including Susie the Little Blue Coupe and The Little House, she designed during that period. Some of Mary Blair's work, notably in So Dear to My Heart, was inspired by quilts. In a letter to Walt Disney, Blair discussed her interest to incorporate quilts into So Dear to My Heart, \\"It seems that quilt making is a revived art in this country now, which fact adds more value to its use as a medium of expression in our picture. . After the completion of Peter Pan, Blair resigned from Disney and worked as a freelance graphic designer and illustrator, creating advertising campaigns for companies such as Nabisco, Pepsodent, Maxwell House, Beatrice Foods and others. She also illustrated several Little Golden Books for publisher Simon & Schuster, some of which remain in print today, and she also designed Christmas and Easter sets for Radio City Music Hall. Blair not only worked in graphic design and animation but also as a designer for Bonwit Teller and created theatrical sets. At the request of Walt Disney, who regarded highly her innate sense of color styling, Blair began work on Disney's new attraction, \\"It's a Small World\\". Originally a Pepsi-Cola-sponsored pavilion benefiting UNICEF at the 1964 New York World's Fair, the attraction moved to Disneyland after the Fair closed and was later replicated at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World Resort as well as Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. Concept art for \\"It's a Small World\\" by Mary Blair. On display at the Disneyland Hotel. Blair's Mural at the Contemporary Resort Blair created murals that would be showcased in Disney parks, hotels and other Disney attractions from California to Florida. These murals were not only painted but some would be tile decor. In 1966, philanthropist Dr. Jules Stein hired Walt Disney to create a ceramic mural for his newly opened Eye Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. Mary Blair designed the mural for Dr. Stein's Pediatric Surgery waiting room. The theme Walt chose for the mural was that of \\"It's a Small World\\" attraction designed by Blair. In 1967, Blair created mural art for the Tomorrowland Promenade. Two similar tile murals flanked the entrance corridor. The mural over Adventure Thru Inner Space was covered over in 1987 with the opening of Star Tours, while the other remained in place until 1998 when the Circle-Vision 360° was replaced by Rocket Rods and a new mural was designed to reflect the new theme. Her design of a mural remains a focal point of the Disney's Contemporary Resort hotel at Walt Disney World, which was completed for the resort's opening in 1971. Mary Blair would also go on to make sets of Walt Disney note cards for Hallmark. In 1968, Blair was credited as color designer on the film version of How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying. Blair would eventually move to Washington for Lee Blair's military career and then return to her in home studio located in Long Island, New York.  Filmography  Films that Mary Blair worked on include: Blair was also a writer for: * Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color * Once Upon a Wintertime Legacy Mary Blair moved back to California and died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Soquel, California on July 26, 1978. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage likely brought on by acute alcoholism. In 1991 Mary was honored as a Disney Legend. Also posthumously, she received the Winsor McCay Award from ASIFA-Hollywood in 1996 along with two other Disney animators. While the fine art she created outside of her association with Disney and her work as an illustrator is not widely known, Blair's bold and ground-breaking color design still inspires many of today's contemporary designers and animators. A Google doodle was created on Friday, October 21, 2011, to commemorate the centennial of her birth. The Doodle featured an image of an illustrator as Mary might have drawn herself, surrounded by the simple patterns and shapes that made up her familiar cartoon world. Simon & Schuster published Pocket Full of Colors, a picture book biography about Mary Blair, in August 2017. The book is written by Amy Guglielmo and Jacqueline Tourville, and illustrated by Brigette Baranger, who once worked as an artist at Disney. Mary Blair has been credited with introducing modernist art styles to Walt Disney and his studio by using primary colors to form intense contrast and colors that are unnatural to the image they are depicting. Blair’s artwork was exhibited in The Colors of Mary Blair at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, July 2009. From March 13 to September 7, 2014, the Magic, Color, Flair: The World of Mary Blair exhibition was on display at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco Presidio, California. There is a visual representation of Blair in Disneyland's It's A Small World ride; she is rendered as a little girl halfway up the Eiffel Tower, holding a balloon.https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/04/five-things-you-might- have-missed-in-its-a-small-world-at-disneyland-park/ See also References  Further reading  * *Nathala Hollt,The Queens of Animation, Little Brown, 2019.

Its initial focus was affordable paperback reprints of classics and scholarly works as well as popular and pulp fiction, but it now publishes trade and hardcover titles. It is currently an imprint of Penguin Random House; it was announced in 2015 that the imprint would publish only nonfiction titles.  History  = 20th century = New American Library (NAL) began life as Penguin U.S.A. and as part of Penguin Books of England. Because of complexities of exchange control and import and export regulations—Penguin made the decision to terminate the association and the New American Library of World Literature was founded in 1948 by Victor Weybright and Kurt Enoch (formally head of Albatross Books). Enoch served as president of New American Library from 1947-1965. He later served as head of Book Publishing at Times Mirror and then stepped down to Vice-President when John P. R. Budlong became president of New American Library in 1965. NAL's productions were not limited to softbound reprints. Original works of mystery, romance, and adventure proved to be profitable and popular. In 1963 the company began publishing original publications in hardback format, such as the immensely popular James Bond \\"007\\" series written by Ian Fleming. NAL also published new \\"quality\\" paperback editions of classic works—for example, a Shakespeare series—which featured renowned scholars, editors, and translators. Many of those editions were oriented toward a high school and college readership. Those paperbound books included subjects in the humanities, the arts, and the sciences. NAL also published at least two notable \\"magazines in book form\\": New World Writing in the 1950s and early 1960s, and New American Review in the latter 1960s and early 1970s (which then moved on to other publishers as American Review). NAL enjoyed great success: by 1965, its Mentor and Signet books annually sold over 50 million volumes. In 1956 NAL reported that \\"over 3 million copies\\" of the Signet Books edition of From Here to Eternity had been sold.Signet Books T1075 - James Jones - From Here to Eternity, flickr.com. Retrieved 30 September 2017. The McCarthy era of the 1950s is notorious for its attacks upon communism and communistic influences in American life, and the object of federal investigations and trials was to eliminate this perceived threat and extinguish any and all communistic elements. NAL became involved with the censorship trials when certain books were deemed inflammatory and subsequently banned. Victor Weybright was asked to testify before a 1952 House Committee that examined pornography. Rather than accept government restrictions, Weybright endorsed a self-regulated censorship policy on the part of publishing companies. Weybright commented thus: > I pointed out with some justification, but certainly not as my basic > argument, that the Mentor list was essential as part of the character and > prestige of our company and an indispensable exhibit when our more daring > fiction—by Faulkner, Farrell, and Caldwell—was attacked by the > censors.Victor Weybright, The Making of a Publisher (New York, Reynal and > Company, 1967), p.207 New York University Library received the NAL archive as a gift from the NAL in the spring of 1965.The Fales Library of NYU's Guide to the New American Library Archive = Acquisitions and mergers = NAL witnessed several changes in ownership beginning in the 1960s. In 1960 Times Mirror of Los Angeles bought NAL; however, NAL continued to operate autonomously within the Mirror Company and management remained unchanged. In 1983 Odyssey Partners and Ira J. Hechler bought NAL from the Times Mirror Company for over $50 million. At the time of the sale New American Library had over 1 billion paperback books in print. In 1985 New American Library acquired E.P. Dutton, an independent hardcover and trade publisher. During this period there was pressure for paperback publishers to add hardcover divisions. NAL had started publishing hardcovers in 1980 with mixed success and determined that Dutton would give them an edge in that space. In 1987, the NAL was reintegrated into the Penguin Publishing Company. Penguin had been purchased by Pearson PLC in 1970. =21st century= In 2013, Pearson PLC merged Penguin with Bertelsmann owned Random House to form Penguin Random House. New American Library is currently part of the Penguin Publishing Group, where it is a sister imprint to the Berkley Publishing Group. In June 2015 it was announced by Penguin that starting in fall of 2016, Berkley would publish fiction titles while New American library would publish only non-fiction titles.

Queen Elizabeth II opened Glasgow Science Centre on 5 July 2001. It is one of Scotland's most popular paid-for visitor attractions. It is a purpose-built science centre composed of three principal buildings: Science Mall, Glasgow Tower and an IMAX cinema. It is a registered charity under Scottish law. The Scottish tourist board, VisitScotland, awarded Glasgow Science Centre a five star rating in the visitor attraction category. As well as its main location, Glasgow Science Centre also manages the visitor centre at Whitelee Wind Farm, which opened to the public in 2009. Science Mall Glasgow Science Centre from the west The largest of the three main, titanium-clad buildings takes a crescent shape structure and houses a Science Mall. In architectural terms it represents the canted hull of a ship, a reference to the adjacent 'canting basin', where vessels were brought to have the marine growth removed from their hulls. Internally, there are three floors of over 250 science-learning exhibits. As is usual for science centres, the exhibits aim to encourage interaction, and can be used or played with as part of the informal learning experience the centre aims to deliver. The building was designed by BDP. On Floor 1, amongst the many interactive exhibits that demonstrate scientific principles, visitors can access a Science Show Theatre and the Glasgow Science Centre Planetarium. The planetarium contains a Zeiss optical-mechanical projector that projects images of the night sky onto a 15m diameter dome. There is an area specifically aimed at young children, called The Big Explorer. On Floor 2, visitors can explore opportunities in STEM careers in the My World of Work Live interactive exhibition space. There is also The Lab, primarily used as an educational workshop space. Floor 3 was refurbished in 2012 and reopened to the public on 28 March 2013. It now houses an interactive exhibition about human health and wellbeing in the 21st century, called BodyWorks. Visitors are invited to consider their bodies, health and lifestyle from a new perspective through 115 interactive exhibits, research capsules and live laboratory experiences. The Ground Floor of the Science Mall contains the ticket desk, cafes, gift shop, and a cloakroom. There are a number of flexible room spaces on the Ground Floor that are used for a variety of educational and corporate purposes: an education space called The Egg; a lecture-theatre space called The Auditorium; and the Clyde Suite, a multi-purpose function space. Access to Glasgow Tower for the public is also via the Ground Floor. Glasgow Tower The Glasgow Tower was designed to be the tallest freely-rotating tower in the world. It missed its opening date in 2001 and was plagued by problems since then. It has been closed for over 80% of its life, and was closed from August 2010 until July 2014. IMAX Cinema The IMAX cinema was the first IMAX cinema to be built in Scotland. The single auditorium seats 370 in front of a rectangular screen measuring by and has the capability to show 3D films as well as standard 2D films in IMAX format. It opened to the public in October 2000, and premiered the first film, entitled \\"Dolphins\\", several months prior to the opening of the two other buildings. On 6 September 2013, Cineworld took over running the cinema. History View of the Glasgow Garden Festival site Opened to the public in June 2001, Glasgow Science Centre is part of the ongoing redevelopment of Pacific Quay, an area which was once a cargo port known as Prince's Dock.Glasgow Harbour 1932 (Burrell Collection Photo Library), The Glasgow Story The redevelopment started with the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988. As with the other National Garden Festivals, the Glasgow site was intended to be sold off for housing development, but due to a housing slump in 1987, the developers were unable to develop the land as they intended, and the majority of the site remained derelict for years. Parts were finally redeveloped for the Science Centre and also Pacific Quay, including new headquarters for BBC Scotland and Scottish Television, opened in 2007. The Clydesdale Bank Tower was dismantled and re-erected in Rhyl in North Wales, however its spiritual successor came in the form of the Glasgow Tower as part of Science Centre complex, which stands on approximately the same spot. The architects of the Glasgow Science Centre were Building Design Partnership, however the Glasgow Tower was originally designed by the architect Richard Horden with engineering design by Buro Happold. It was built at a cost of around £75 million, including £10 million for the Glasgow Tower, with over £37 million coming from the Millennium Commission. Funding issues In June 2004, it was announced that about a fifth of the workforce were to be made redundant following the creation of a funding deal with the Scottish Executive. In June 2008, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Nicol Stephen, stated that Glasgow Science Centre was facing a 40% cut in government funding. Prime Minister Gordon Brown commented on this issue during Prime Minister's Questions saying, \\"It's unfortunate in Glasgow that as a result of the SNP, funding has been cut, and they will live to regret that\\". Although funding for the Scottish Science Centres as a whole has actually increased, it is now being split between four centres using a formula based on visitor numbers, and Glasgow is the only centre to face a reduction in budget. This led to the announcement in July 2008 that 28 full-time jobs were to be cut as a direct consequence of the cuts \\"in order to secure Glasgow Science Centre's future\\", according to the Chief Executive, Kirk Ramsay. In the media Glasgow Science Centre is located in the Pacific Quay area, and as such, is surrounded by the media centres that form the Digital Media Quarter, a Scottish Enterprise development initiative, With the opening of the new STV headquarters in June 2006 and the beginning of broadcast programming from BBC Pacific Quay in the summer of 2004, it can be expected that more programming will be filmed in the area. In the CBeebies television programme Nina and the Neurons, the title character Nina is a neuroscientist who works at Glasgow Science Centre. In reality, Nina is played by the actress Katrina Bryan who is not a staff member at Glasgow Science Centre.

The school opened in the 1997-1998 school year as part of the Redlands Unified School District. Description A view of the campus facing northeast. Redlands East Valley is a comprehensive high school located on a sloping site, designed to house 2,500 students. An element in the design was a focus on the media center and its application of technology. The majority of the building exteriors are built with concrete masonry, exposed structural steel, glass, and metal roofs. The school colors and mascot were chosen to contrast cross-town rival Redlands High School, an example being how Redlands East Valley has a Wildcat and Redlands High has a Terrier. The school cost US$35,000,000 (41 million 1995) to build and was completed in September, 1997. The roof of the Media Center Library was designed to look like an opened book. The performing arts building was designed to look like a piano, complete with black and white tiles on the floor in the piano lab. The Performing Arts Theater is named in honor of Harry Blackstone Jr., a stage magician who lived in Redlands. The school offers the Advanced Placement program.

The leaves are alternate, long, and pinnate or nearly so, with 7–21 leaflets. The flowers are produced in a tight globose [inflorescence] in diameter, with no petals. The fruit is also a dense ball of many seeds; in many (but not all) species the seeds bear a barbed arrowhead point, the seedhead forming a burr which attaches itself to animal fur or feathers for dispersal. Several Acaena species in New Zealand are known by the common name bidibid. The word is written variously bidi-bidi, biddy- biddy, biddi-biddi, biddi-bid and a number of other variations. These names are the English rendition of the original Māori name of piripiri.Orsman, H. W. (1999). The Dictionary of New Zealand English. Auckland: Oxford University Press.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 18, 1997. Bart gets sent to a military academy as punishment for bad behavior. While visiting the academy, Lisa sees that the school is far more challenging than hers and she decides that she wants to attend as well. It was directed by Mike B. Anderson, written by Richard Appel and featured Willem Dafoe in a guest spot as the school's commandant. Plot After a day watching mind-numbing videos in class, Lisa worries that her education is not challenging enough. Bart's class goes on a field trip to the Springfield Police Department, where Bart finds a room with several megaphones. He places each bullhorn end-to-end, increasing their amplification, and speaks into one by saying “Testing”, creating a sonic shockwave that shatters all the glass in Springfield. Chief Wiggum suggests sending Bart to military school to correct his behavior. Under the ruse they are going to Disneyland, Homer and Marge drive the kids to Rommelwood Military School; while there, Lisa decides she also wants to enroll. Homer and Marge reluctantly agree and ignore Bart's protests that he wants to go home. Lisa stirs discontent among the students because she is the first female student and gets her own barracks. After she and Bart endure hazing, Bart is eventually accepted by the other cadets and distances himself from his sister. Lonely, Lisa considers going home, but decides to see it through. As the school year comes to a close, the Commandant reveals the final test for the students: the \\"Eliminator\\", a hand-over-hand crawl across a rope suspended high above thorn bushes. Lisa fears she will not be able to complete the task, but Bart helps her train in secret. On the day of the test, Lisa is the last to cross the Eliminator. She is about to fall as the students jeer, but Bart cheers her on and she makes it across safely. The other students vow to make the rest of the semester a living hell for Bart, but realize that they graduate in only three hours. The Commandant awards Lisa a special medal \\"For Satisfactory Completion of the Second Grade\\". After the ceremony, Homer and Marge tell the kids they will visit Disneyland \\"for real\\" this time, but instead drive them to a dentist's office. Production Richard Appel wrote the episode. The episode was written by Richard Appel, but the idea of Bart and Lisa attending a military academy had previously been pitched, and had been floating around since 1991. The idea had not yet been used as an episode plot, because the writers had not felt comfortable with taking Bart and Lisa to a strange place early in the series. During the scene where the Commandant is talking, there is a brief shot of Lisa blinking. As there had been an error in the final print of the episode, the shot was animated, painted and shot on May 16, 1997, the Friday before the episode's airdate. The spiky blond-haired boy, who runs towards the Eliminator while screaming, is a caricature of director Mike B. Anderson. Reception The episode originally aired on May 18, 1997, as the season finale, along with a rerun of \\"The Springfield Files.\\" The episode was mistakenly anticipated by some as being about Lisa launching \\"a legal battle\\" to enroll at the military school. In its original broadcast, \\"The Secret War of Lisa Simpson\\" finished 47th in ratings for the week of May 12–18, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.3, equivalent to approximately 8.1 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, disliked the episode, writing that it was \\"very dull\\" and that Dafoe was not used well. However, Dafoe is one of show runner Josh Weinstein's favorite guest stars. Ian Johnson argued Dafoe's casting was \\"rare\\" and \\"somewhat offbeat\\". Journalist Raju Mudhar also wrote that in this episode, \\"The Simpsons have succinctly laid out our eventual future.\\" This referred to the rise of robots in the real world and the quote from this episode: > \\"The wars of the future will not be fought on the battlefield or at sea. > They will be fought in space, or possibly on top of a very tall mountain. In > either case, most of the actual fighting will be done by small robots. And > as you go forth today remember always your duty is clear: To build and > maintain those robots.\\" Merchandise The episode was one of four in 1999 released on a VHS (Re- released on DVD in 2005) called Bart Wars focused on crosses between The Simpsons and Star Wars. However, one critic wrote that with this episode and \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\" and \\"Dog of Death,\\" both of which are also on the DVD, the \\"Star Wars connection\\" is \\"tangential at best.\\"\\"Mark Hamill advises Homer to 'use the forks' in new Simpsons release,\\" National Post, May 14, 2005, pg.

Moyale is the main border post on the Nairobi-Addis Ababa road, lying north of the Dide Galgalu Desert. It is known for its traditional architecture. History An early settler at Moyale was a Greek by the name of Zaphiro, who had a station which he had named \\"Fort Harrington\\". When C.W. Gwynn visited in 1908, Zaphiro's station consisted of a garden that covered several acres and his house, located on a spur projecting from the Boran highlands, and providing access through the line of cliffs that run along the border. \\"This route may well become some day a considerable trade artery,\\" Gwynn predicted. \\"Fort Harrington is therefore well placed as a healthy administrative post and as a possible commercial centre.\\"C. W. Gwynn, \\"A Journey in Southern Abyssinia\\", Geographical Journal, 38 (August 1911), p. 122 During World War II, both parts of the town were captured by Italians from Ethiopia in 1940, and retaken by the British on 15 July 1941. Tensions rose in the Kenyan side of Moyale in early 1999, after an Imam was shot dead during an Ethiopian raid across the Ethiopian-Kenyan border in pursuit of rebels of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). The Kenyan residents of the town, held demonstrations condemning the action, which they attributed to Ethiopian security men who believed he was a sympathizer of the OLF.\\"Horn of Africa, Monthly Review, December '98-January '99\\", UN-OCHA Archive (accessed 23 February 2009) In March 2018, nine civilians were killed by the Ethiopian National Defense Force near Moyale after being misidentified as Oromo Liberation Front militants. In November 2009, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi announced plans to extend the Ethiopian railroad to Moyale. This would facilitate Kenyan plans, which at the time were at an advanced stage, to develop the port of Lamu and connect it to the Kenyan side of Moyale with a tarmac road.\\"Kenya, Ethiopia for joint infrastructure (November 24, 2009)\\" , press release of the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (accessed 28 December 2009) This business town is disputed between the two dominant ethnic groups who are Oromos and Somalis. Moyale saw four days of ethnic clashes in July 2012 over a long-standing land dispute between Borana and Garre communities, exacerbated by drought conditions. The fighting left at least eighteen dead, and more than twenty thousand people fled across the border into Kenya. Demographics For the Ethiopian share of Moyale, based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, it has an estimated total population of 25,038 of whom 13,665 are men and 11,373 are women.CSA 2005 National Statistics, Table B.4 The 1994 Ethiopian census reported that the Ethiopian side of Moyale had a total population of 13,962, of whom 7,411 were men and 6,551 were women. (This total also includes an estimate for parts of the town of Moyale, which were not counted; for these parts of the town, it was estimated there were 3,419 inhabitants, of whom 1,752 were men and 1,667 were women.) The five largest ethnic groups reported in Moyale were the Borana Oromo (50.94%), the Garre Somali (15.15%), the Burji (11.75%), the Degodia Somali (5.10%), the Amhara (9.42%), the Hawadle Somali (4.54%), the Welayta (4.82%), and the Silt'e (4.28%).1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Oromia Region, Vol. 1, part 1, Tables 2.1, 2.3, 2.14, 2.17 (accessed 6 April 2009) Other groups reported in Moyale include the Borana Oromo and the Garre Somali.

The battle was the first engagement between units of General Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia after that army's evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia on April 2, 1865 and units of the Union Army (Army of the Shenandoah, Army of the Potomac and Army of the James) under the immediate command of Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, who was still acting independently as commander of the Army of the Shenandoah, and under the overall direction of Union General-in-Chief Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. The forces immediately engaged in the battle were brigades of the cavalry division of Union Brig. Gen. and Brevet Maj. Gen. George Armstrong Custer, especially the brigade of Colonel and Brevet Brig. Gen. William Wells, and the Confederate rear guard cavalry brigades of Brig. Gen. William P. Roberts and Brig. Gen. Rufus Barringer and later in the engagement, Confederate infantry from the division of Maj. Gen. Bushrod Johnson. The engagement signaled the beginning of the Union Army's relentless pursuit of the Confederate forces (Army of Northern Virginia and Richmond local defense forces) after the fall of Petersburg and Richmond after the Third Battle of Petersburg (sometimes known as the Breakthrough at Petersburg or Fall of Petersburg), which led to the near disintegration of Lee's forces within 6 days and the Army of Northern Virginia's surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865. Capt. Tom Custer, the general's brother, was cited at this battle for the first of two Medals of Honor that he received for actions within four days. Background =Siege and Breakthrough at Petersburg= During the 292-day Richmond–Petersburg Campaign (Siege of Petersburg) Union General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant had to conduct a campaign of trench warfare and attrition in which the Union forces tried to wear down the less numerous Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, destroy or cut off sources of supply and supply lines to Petersburg and Richmond and extend the defensive lines which the outnumbered and declining Confederate force had to defend to the breaking point.Hess, Earl J.

In the early morning of April 3, at a ford on Namozine Creek, regiments from the 2d brigade, under the command of Colonel William Wells, of Custer's 3rd cavalry division, which had taken over the advance pursuit, threatened the rear guard of Rooney Lee's column. That rear guard was the cavalry brigade of Brig. Gen. William P. Roberts and a few infantry units. Roberts had dismounted the 4th North Carolina Cavalry Regiment and the 16th North Carolina Cavalry Battalion and had them entrench on the west side of the creek. Custer brought up artillery to blast the North Carolina cavalrymen with canister and had the 1st Vermont Volunteer Cavalry Regiment ford the creek out of sight of the Confederates in order to outflank them. When the Confederates discovered this maneuver, they fled their position in order to try to regroup further down the road. Custer's division then crossed the creek and headed for Namozine Church, about away. The leading Union cavalry brigade of Custer's 3rd Division, the 2d Brigade under Col. William Wells, who had attacked the Confederate cavalrymen of Brig. Gen. Rufus Barringer along the creek, fought a running battle along the road until they reached Namozine Church. Barringer's Confederates, the 1st and 2d North Carolina Volunteer Cavalry Regiments with a single artillery piece, with the 5th North Carolina Volunteer Cavalry Regiment in reserve,Barringer's brigade also included the 3rd North Carolina Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. counterattacked the 8th New York Volunteer Cavalry Regiment of Wells's brigade, commanded by Maj. James Bliss, as they reached the Namozine Church After sharp fighting, the Confederate cavalry were turned away by the 8th New York Cavalry and reinforcements from the 15th New York Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, commanded by Col. John J. Coppinger' and the 1st Vermont Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, commanded by Lt. Col. Josiah Hall. About 9:00 a.m., as Wells's brigade began their attack, Brig. Gen. Custer's younger brother, Captain Tom Custer, spurred his horse over a hastily thrown up barricade of the still deploying Confederate cavalry and captured 3 Confederate officers and 11 enlisted men, as well as the battle flag of the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry. For his actions, Tom Custer would eventually be awarded a Medal of Honor, one of two he would earn within four days. Barringer's Confederate cavalry had bought enough time for Bushrod Johnson's infantry division to pass nearby Namozine Church around 8:00 a.m. Unfortunately for Johnson, his forces took a wrong turn at a fork in the road and had to halt when his command reached a bridge over Deep Creek that was underwater from recent flooding. Although the Union cavalry drove off the Confederate cavalry, the North Carolina cavalry regiments had secured the Namozine Church road intersection long enough for Johnson to return and take the correct fork. When General Johnson approached with his infantry division, Custer's forces were forced to retire, allowing the Confederate forces to proceed across Deep Creek, an Appomattox River tributary.Longacre, 2002, p. 330. Then, Fitzhugh Lee and his cousin, \\"Rooney\\" Lee, second son of Gen. Robert E. Lee, separated their cavalry commands and continued their retreat. Custer later chased the fleeing Confederates but near dark he ran into substantial infantry opposition from Johnson's division at Sweathouse Creek and halted for the night. After dark, however, Wells's brigade continued to attack Fitzhugh Lee's force along Deep Creek. Brig. Gen. Barringer and many of his men were captured by Sheridan's scouts who were wearing gray uniforms and who led Barringer and his remaining men into a trap. Rooney Lee's adjutant general, Maj. J. D. Ferguson, also was captured. Sheridan's forces camped for the night along the road from Namozine Church to Deep Creek while the Confederate infantry and remaining cavalry continued to march to their designated consolidation point of Amelia Court House, where they expected to receive much needed supplies and rations.

Total Confederate losses are not known, but Custer's men were able to capture many of the Confederates. They took 350 prisoners, 100 horses and an artillery piece while initially clearing the road as far as the Namozine Church. Johnson reported 15 wounded from his division. After the battle, Namozine Church served as a field hospital and later as Maj. Gen. Sheridan's temporary headquarters. Aftermath On April 4, 1865, the opposing forces skirmished at Tabernacle Church or Beaver Pond Creek and at Amelia Court House.Long, 1971, p. 666. Meanwhile, Sheridan's forces occupied Jetersville, Virginia and Burkeville, Virginia which blocked Lee's access to the Richmond and Danville Railroad and to the direct route southwestward.Salmon, 2001, p. 474. Lee had hoped to find a supply train at Amelia Court House, Virginia, southwest of Richmond, but when he and his forces arrived there on April 4, 1865, he found that the train contained only ordnance, ammunition, caissons and harnesses. After a delay for unsuccessful foraging efforts, or as some historians have argued, primarily because of the delay in bringing up a pontoon bridge needed to cross rain-swollen rivers, Lee had to order his hungry men to resume their march in the hope that they could find rations at Farmville, Virginia. On April 5, 1865, Sheridan ordered Crook to send cavalry patrols north of Jetersville to reconnoiter his left flank.Davis, 1981, p. 231.Salmon, 2001, p. 475. Between and out of Jetersville, Union Brig. Gen. Henry E. Davies, Jr. attacked and destroyed about 200 wagons of a Confederate army wagon train and took at least 300 prisoners.Salmon, 2001, p. 476. Confederate cavalry engaged Davies's rear guard in a running combat through Amelia Springs but Davies's force linked up with reinforcements near Jetersville which permitted Davies to limit his losses and keep his prisoners. On the morning of April 6, Meade thought that the Confederate army remained concentrated at Amelia Court House and, despite the suspicions of Grant and Sheridan that the Confederates had moved on,Livermore, 1907, pp. 496-497.

It was also called as thuvayal panthi. (panthi means an arrangement of people in a row for meals during feasts). By the late thirties of the nineteenth century, when the religion of Ayyavazhi had come to exist with certain excitement and euphoria, a group of people, of different age groups and genders, undertook to perform this unique exercise as directed by Lord Vaikundar. Participants of this exercise seem to have sold out their properties in a manner of renunciation, at half of their value. And, with a bare minimum of means of livelihood, they had gone to a place near the eastern seashore, know presently as Vakaippathi, situated at about four kilometers to the north of Cape Comorin. They camped there together and performed the following actions in a manner of a ritual: They took a bath and washed their clothes in the seawater thrice everyday and cooked vegetarian meal with raw rice and green-grams, and ate it only once a day. The manner of eating was that they took it directly with their mouth from the sandy ground where the food had been laid. They drank only the salty water and abstained from fish. Apart from washing, cooking and eating, the remaining hours were spent on spiritual exercises. They recited certain incantations taught by persons among them who had the gift of oracles. These persons instructed the group whatever they had to do. It was one of these persons that taught the group the popular incantation called Ukappatippu literally meaning ‘song of the aeon’, the recital of which, often an abridged version of it, forms part of the daily rituals of Ayyavazhi to this day. There seems to have been some opposition to the practice of this exercise of thuvayal thavasu. There is a verse in Akilathirattu that says, the wicked violently dispersed those that participated in this thuvayal thavasu. The high caste people caused trouble and tried to disperse the participants. But the participants seem to have withstood and continued the exercise. As per the account of Akilathirattu, the people performed this exercise for about six months. As the days passed, stinkbugs, ticks, swarming flies and other pests caused skin diseases and serious disturbances of them. People took them as test caused by Ayya Vaikundar of their faith, courage and fortitude, and withstood all the tribulations. Finally, being instructed through a persons dream, they ended the thavasu at Vakaippathi, and, went over to a place now known as Muttappathi, situated at a distance of three kilometers to the south of Vakaippathi. At Muttappathi, they spent a month in similar exercises, and stopped it only when struck by severe diseases that killed a few of them, which they read as definite sign to end the thavasu. After ending the thavasu, the participants went back to their native places. They were received with respect and reverence, and, addressed honourably as Thuvayal pantarams They went to different places, and spread whatever they had learned from the thavasu. They were received cordially by the followers of Ayyavazhi who considered it a religious virtue to be hospitable to them. The now prevalent practice of offering food (called as thavanakanci) in Nizhal Thangals seems to have originated from this act of charity. The participants external appearance seems to have undergone a change after this exercise. Akilathirattu says that the surrounding people who witnessed them exclaimed as follows: \\"The dress of the Namputiri and other Brahmins have lost their shine, whereas that of the Chanar shine like the sun... See what a change has come about for Chanars. The people who awaited avidly the arrival of fish and ate it even half cooked in a greedy manner, and chewed tobacco incessantly, have transformed themselves so much!\\" The LMS Report for the year 1892 puts it as: \\"It is true that their [the devoteed of Vikunda Swamy] bodies and their houses are more cleanly [sic] than those of the rest.\\" References * Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, 2002 Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam Publications. * G.

Historically within the West Riding of Yorkshire, it lies amongst the Pennines on the River Tame below the village of Denshaw, east-northeast of Oldham, and north-northwest of Uppermill. The centre of the village has barely changed from the 19th century when a number of small textile mills provided employment for the local community. There is a significant first century AD Roman fort at Castleshaw. The village is home to one of the Saddleworth Whit Friday brass band contests, with in the region of seventy-five bands from across the UK and beyond marching down the main street at five-minute intervals on the evening of the contest which often continues into the early hours. In the village of Dobcross a Henry Livings memorial prize is open to bands who play on any of the morning's walks on Whit Friday. It is also home to the Millgate Arts Centre, the home of the Saddleworth Players. This group puts on six plays a year, as well as hosting a number of other events throughout the year. The main street running through the centre of Delph was used in some of the external shots of the 2001 feature film The Parole Officer, starring Steve Coogan, Om Puri and Jenny Agutter. Delph was also used in the filming of the Whit Friday scene in the 1996 film Brassed Off. Delph is mentioned in the song \\"This One's For Now\\" by the band Half Man Half Biscuit on their 2014 album Urge for Offal. The legendary landmark above Delph 'St Thomas Church at The Heights' was featured in the blockbuster movie \\"A Monster Calls\\" starring Liam Neeson. Delph railway station was opened in 1851 as part of the London and North Western Railway route from Oldham to Delph. The station closed in May 1955, when the Delph Donkey passenger train service to Delph via Greenfield was withdrawn. The A62 road runs just south of the village and was previously the main thoroughfare from Manchester and Oldham into Huddersfield and Leeds, although now sees comparatively lower traffic levels upon the opening of the M62 around 5 miles north of Delph. Local buses run to Oldham and Ashton-Under- Lyne. Despite popular belief, Fabian Delph has never been to Delph, nor does he own a small business in the area.

It is situated in the former Eastern Province and is almost surrounded by the Marsabit National Park and Marsabit National Reserve. The town is located 170 km east of the center of the East African Rift, at 37°58' E, 2°19' N (37.97°E, 2.32 N) at an elevation of between 1300 and 1400 metres.https://www.mountain- forecast.com/peaks/Marsabit/forecasts/1707 It serves as the capital of Marsabit County, and lies southeast of the Chalbi Desert in a forested area known for its volcanoes and crater lakes and others. Overview The town of Marsabit is an outpost of urban civilization in the vast desert of northern Kenya. The town is situated on an isolated extinct volcano, Mount Marsabit, which rises almost a kilometer above the desert. The hills here are heavily forested, in contrast to the desert beyond, with their own \\"insular\\" eco- system. The town currently has a population of about 5,000. Marsabit is located southeast of the Chalbi Desert. The town is mainly inhabited by the Cushitic-speaking Borana Oromo people. There are also very few Nilotic Turkana and Bantu Ameru residents. Additionally, there are also few non-Cushitic- speaking traders. Marsabit has an airstrip and a mountain peak (Mount Marsabit), with \\"singing\\" wells just outside the town. Elephants can also often be seen in the local wildlife refuge that surrounds the town, occasionally breaking down fences and causing damage to local farmers' crop beds. The name is possibly from the Amharic word 'Marsa bet' (Meaning Marsa's home/house) and is believed to have been named after a farmer named 'Marsa' (ethnically Burji) who was brought to Marsabit from Mega (in Ethiopia) by the Consul to assist in consolidation of farming and permanent settlement on the slopes of Mount Marsabit. Culture and religion Stone pit right outside the far out town of Marsabit. Besides the aforementioned ethnic groups, there are other people from other parts of Kenya who are there working mostly for the government and business. Muslims, Christians and adherents of traditional religions all inhabit the town. Marsabit is the announced location for a conference between Borana and Gabra elders scheduled for 2–6 June 2009. Discussions to resolve existing conflicts between the two groups have been underway for several years now, and agreements are expected to be sealed at the event at this conference in the presence of traditional leaders.\\"Borana and Gabra peace meeting in Dukana\\" , Pastoralists Communication Initiative website (accessed 5 May 2009) Transport Aerial view of area on the outskirts of Marsabit. Marsabit is approximately 550 kilometers or 7 - 8 Hour drive from Nairobi via the towns of Isiolo and Archers Post. Reaching the town was previously a challenge as you had to either hang on top of the trucks or hike lifts in government vehicles. Currently, there are multiple bus services which ply the Isiolo-Marsabit route on a daily basis. It leaves Isiolo for Marsabit at 8pm, arriving between 3 and 5am and leaves Marsabit at 8am arriving in Isiolo between 3 and 7pm. In addition to this, there are other buses which ply the Nairobi-Moyale route, through Marsabit. The road has been recently paved and connects all the way to the Kenya-Ethiopia Border at Moyale. It is approximately 277 kilometers from Isiolo and takes between 3 and 4 hours. There are two airstrips servicing charter aircraft, one close to town, about 10 minutes' drive towards Moyale (Marsabit Airstrip), and the second about 30 minutes away towards Chalbi (Segel Airstrip). The Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) flight is the only regular flight to Marsabit on Tuesdays and Fridays. Economy Camels watering in Marsabit. Marsabit town is a trading and commercial centre, with three petrol stations, three commercial banks, post office, shops, restaurants, lodges and even a dry cleaner. The town facilitates the supply and movement of goods and services between Moyale (goods from Ethiopia) and Isiolo (goods from Nairobi). Agriculture also plays a role, as many grow millet and maize to be consumed locally and nomadic people supply beef by selling their cows. Lake Paradise (which attracts game animals such as elephants and buffalo), and Bongole Crater located in the heart of the forest are both local attractions for tourists. The town and surrounding area are of rich cultural interest to anthropologists and other researchers. Solar eclipse of November 3, 2013 Marsabit was listed as one of the locations that would experience a total solar eclipse on November 3, 2013. The total solar eclipse would have lasted a maximum of 1 minute and 39 seconds. About 1,000 tourists flocked to Sibiloi national park to get a glimpse of the rare occurrence. Climate Marsabit has an altitude-influenced dry-summer tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: As).

The buildings above ground on Karlsplatz are a well-known example of Jugendstil architecture. These buildings were included in The Vienna Secession, as they followed many of the artistic styles of that movement. They were designed by Otto Wagner, adviser to the Transport Commission in Vienna, and Joseph Maria Olbrich and are, unlike the other Stadtbahn stations, made of a steel framework with marble slabs mounted on the exterior. These stations allowed Otto Wagner to achieve his goal of creating two modern axes of architecture in a city that was becoming one of the most modern cities of its time. These buildings went on to become the most modern monument of the modern city. Architectural critic and poet Friedrich Achleitner commented on the Stadtbahn stations as follows \\"...In these two station buildings Wagner reached a highpoint of his dialectic (in his planning of the Stadtbahn) between function and poetry, construction and decoration, whereby a severe rationalism engages in competition with an almost Secessionist kind of decoration.\\" The station was opened as Akademiestraße in 1899. When the Stadtbahn line was converted to U-Bahn in 1981, the original station was scheduled to be demolished. However, as a result of public outcry, it was decided to keep the station buildings. Both buildings were disassembled, renovated, and then reassembled two metres higher than their original location after completion of U-Bahn construction. One of the buildings is now used as an exhibition space by the Vienna Museum, with an U-Bahn entrance in its rear; the other is used as a café.

Biography Kenyon was born on April 25, 1867, in Hadley, New York. At age 17, he was converted in a Methodist prayer meeting. He became a church member in his early twenties and gave his first sermon at the Methodist Church of Amsterdam, New York, where he served as a deacon. Kenyon had a crisis of faith and left the faith for 2 1/2 years prior returning to faith in 1893. Although desiring to be an actor, Kenyon earned a living as a piano and organ salesperson. In an attempt to hone his acting skills, Kenyon attended the Emerson School of Oratory in Boston for one year in 1892 studying acting. Kenyon first married Evva Spurling. The two were married on May 8, 1893. Shortly afterward, Kenyon attended the services of Clarendon Street Baptist Church led by pastor Adoniram Judson (A.J.) Gordon. At this service, Kenyon and his wife rededicated their lives to the Lord. Later that year, Kenyon joined the Free Will Baptists and became a pastor at a small church in Elmira, New York. In 1898, Kenyon opened Bethel Bible Institute in Spencer, Massachusetts, which remained in operation until 1923. He was its president for twenty-five years. The school later moved to Providence, Rhode Island, and became Providence Bible Institute. It later became Barrington College and merged with Gordon College, which was named after one of Kenyon's many mentors, A. J. Gordon. It is now known as Gordon College. Evva Kenyon died in 1914. Subsequently, Kenyon married Alice M. Whitney and had a son and a daughter with her. In 1948, E. W. Kenyon died, and his daughter Ruth, with whom he was living, continued on with his publishing ministry.E.W. Kenyon: The True Story by Joe McIntyre. \\"Positive confession\\" and New Thought Controversy It has been suggested by some that Kenyon was the originator of the modern \\"positive confession\\" theology which is prevalent in Word of Faith Pentecostalism. Proponents of this view suggest that Kenyon's religious views were heavily influenced by the New Thought Movement during his time at the Emerson School, and that he developed the teaching of positive confession from that influence.Stanley M. Burgess and Eduard M. van der Mass, eds., The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements, Rev. ed. (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 2003), Kindle edition, \\"Positive Confession Theology\\". According to Kenyon biographer Joe McIntyre, the actual influence Kenyon's time at Emerson had on his religious views is debatable.McIntyre, Joe, E. W. Kenyon and His Message of Faith: The True Story. Creation House, 1997, pp. 15-22. Instead, McIntyre suggests that Kenyon developed his positive confession teaching primarily from the teachings of Holiness Movement, Faith Cure and Higher Life movement ministers of the late 19th Century. Evidence that the teaching of positive confession was already developing in Christianity before Kenyon is present in time period literature. In the 1884 book The Atonement for Sin and Sickness, Russell Kelso Carter demonstrates an early version of what Kenyon later taught: \\"I only prayed, O, Lord, make me sure of the truth, and I will confess it; I have nothing to do with consequences; that is Thy part,\\" and again, \\"Jesus has the keeping part, I have the believing and confessing.\\"Carter, Russell Kelso. The Atonement for Sin and Sickness. Willard Tract Repository, 1884, pp. 3-4. According to Milmon F. Harrison Kenneth E. Hagin who was once thought to be the founder of Word of Faith Movement, is no longer considered to be the founder or main source of its ideas. Harrison discusses the similarities between the writings of the two which included entire passages and resulted in critics arguing that Hagin plagiarised Kenyon.

The station has four tracks and two island platforms for passenger service, with a fifth track passing through for Providence and Worcester Railroad freight trains. It is now the 11th busiest Amtrak station in the country, and the second-busiest on the MBTA Commuter Rail system outside of Boston. The station was built in 1986 during a project to remove elevated tracks from downtown Providence. It is fully handicapped accessible for all trains. Rail service Two of Amtrak's passenger rail routes serve the station: the Acela Express and the Northeast Regional. The Acela Express is the United States' only high-speed rail service; the Regional is a slower local service. Both connect Providence with the Northeast Corridor from Boston to Washington D.C. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) also serves Providence. The Providence/Stoughton commuter rail line's southern terminus is located at Wickford Junction, two stops south of Providence. The Providence/Stoughton Line provides commuter service to towns between the airport, Providence and Boston, sharing track with Amtrak trains. In a 2018 count, Providence averaged 2,091 inbound MBTA passengers on weekdays, making it the second-busiest station on the system (after ) outside of Boston History Union Station, 1847-1896 A postcard image of the 2nd Union Station, circa 1910 Providence's first railroad station was built in 1835 by the Boston and Providence Rail Road at India Point. The Providence and Stonington built a depot at Crary Street in South Providence in 1838, and the two were soon connected by a ferry service. The first through service stopped at Union Station, a brick edifice built in 1847 by the Providence & Worcester, Providence & Stonington, and Boston & Providence Railroads. It was designed by 21-year-old architect Thomas Alexander Tefft. This building was lost to fire in 1896 and was replaced by a larger Union Station, completed in 1898 by the New Haven Railroad. It consisted of five large brick structures, which still form the northern side of Kennedy Plaza in the center of Downtown Providence. In 1986, the Northeast Corridor through Providence was relocated north to free up land from a mass of elevated tracks, popularly called the \\"Chinese Wall,\\" that had hemmed in downtown Providence. The new and smaller station was built across Gaspee Street from the Rhode Island State House. The five tracks and two platforms are located below ground level underneath the station building. =Service history= Amtrak has served Providence since its inception in 1971, with Northeast Corridor trains from Boston to New York and Washington. Local commuter service - both intrastate service and service to Boston - has been intermittent during this era. After Penn Central discontinued their New London to Boston commuter train in 1972, Rhode Island sponsored a short lived Westerly to Providence service (which lasted until 1979) in addition to the MBTA's Providence to Boston service. Sunday service ended in October 1977 and off-peak and Saturday service ended in April 1979 due to Rhode Island's limited subsidies; rush-hour service ceased on February 20, 1981. Rush hour commuter service began again (to the new station) in February 1988, with off- peak service added in December 2000 and weekend service added in July 2006. A new layover facility for MBTA commuter trains, located north of the station in Pawtucket, opened in 2006, allowing the MBTA to increase service to the city. Service was further extended to T.F. Green Airport in December 2010 and to Wickford Junction in April 2012. Additionally, some game-day service to Foxboro has run from Providence since 1994, as well as a brief stint in 1971. Special trains run for New England Patriots football games as well as some New England Revolution soccer games and college sporting events. The first revenue Acela Express service to Providence was on December 11, 2000, concurrent with the expansion of MBTA service. In August 2019, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded RIDOT up to $12.5 million for a 'major rehabilitation' of the station. The $25 million project is also funded by RIDOT ($5.25 million) and Amtrak ($7.25 million). Architecture Interior of the station Distinctive brutalist clock tower in the station's southwest corner The station was designed in the Washington, D.C. office of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill by Milo Meacham under the direction of Marilyn Jordan Taylor. It is a simple building in the brutalist style, with a large square clocktower. Although largely subterranean and lacking the grand scale that was possible in when Union Station was built in 1898, the station has been positively received by critics. The project received a citation in the 1983 Progressive Architecture Awards. Local architectural historian William McKenzie Woodward lauded the building for its aesthetics, calling its saucer dome \\"an obvious yet very gracious gesture toward the State House\\". In 2010, Architect praised the forethought of the designers in planning for the revitalization of Providence's downtown, saying that \\"[i]ts design accommodated the complex geometries of a circulation pattern oriented toward the Capitol and a structure aligned with the tracks, while its splayed plan opened out to what was then an imagined city, one that Providence eventually made happen.\\" Bus connections A southbound R-Line bus stopped at Providence Kennedy Plaza, the main hub for RIPTA bus service, is located to the south along Exchange Street.

It operated domestic services and flights to neighbouring countries. Its main base was located at El Dorado International Airport, Bogotá, with a secondary hub at Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport) in Cali.  History  The airline was founded and started operations in 1960 as Aeropesca Colombia. The company had several accidents, and was sold to a group of shareholders who changed their name and image. Only the Vickers Viscount and Curtiss C-46 left the company. A Douglas DC-9-15 and another Vickers Viscount were purchased, and in 1982 began operating from Bogotá to the west. In 1986 it changed shareholders, consolidated itself as a developing company and became a competition for Avianca and SAM. The airline begins operating international flights in 1991, and in 1993 more DC-9-15 and DeHavilland DHC-8 were acquired. The Executive Class and VIP lounges began to be offered in Bogotá, Cali, Medellin and Barranquilla. In 2000 Beechcraft 1900D aircraft were purchased, which, as well as two Boeing 737-300s, which were never operated. The airline was forced to cease operating in September 2005 following the crash of West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 in Venezuela. After the crash, the Colombian Civil Aviation authority required that all airlines undergo a special inspection of its maintenance facilities and aircraft. Intercontinental de Aviación was one of three airlines forced to cease operating due to a failure of these inspections (along with AeroTACA and West Caribbean itself).

The order in its current sense is based on molecular research and not on any unifying morphological characteristics. According to one 2008 estimate, the Hymenochaetales contain around 600 species worldwide, mostly corticioid fungi and poroid fungi, but also including several clavarioid fungi and agarics. Species of economic importance include wood decay fungi in the genera Phellinus and Inonotus sensu lato, some of which may cause losses in forestry. Therapeutic properties are claimed for Inonotus obliquus (\\"chaga\\") and Phellinus linteus, both of which are now commercially marketed. Taxonomy =History= The order was proposed in 1977 to recognize the family Hymenochaetaceae at a higher taxonomic rank. As originally conceived, species within the Hymenochaetales had several morphological features in common, notably brown or brownish basidiocarps (fruit bodies) that turn black in alkali, hyphae lacking clamp connections, and the presence (in most species) of characteristic setae (thick-walled, thorn-shaped cystidia, visible under a hand lens). Subsequent ultrastructure research showed that the Hymenochaetales had dolipores with imperforate parenthesomes, whereas most Agaricomycetes have dolipores with perforate parenthesomes. Species of the corticioid genera Hyphodontia and Schizopora were later found to share this peculiarity, suggesting they might also be related to the Hymenochaetales, though morphologically dissimilar. =Current status= Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has substantially expanded and redefined the Hymenochaetales, dividing the order into at least six different clades. The core clade represents the traditional Hymenochaetaceae, excluding the genera Coltricia and Coltriciella; another clade includes the corticioid genera Lyomyces and Schizopora (Schizoporaceae), together with Coltricia and Coltriciella as a subclade; a further clade (Repetobasidiaceae) includes agaricoid Rickenella species, the clavarioid Alloclavaria purpurea, and various corticioid fungi, including the genus Repetobasidium; the three remaining clades consist of corticioid Hyphodontia species, corticioid Kneifiella species, and poroid Oxyporus species. Not all the species currently placed within the Hymenochaetales have dolipores with imperforate parenthosomes, so the order lacks any shared morphological characteristics.

Species of Coltricia and Coltriciella are ectomycorrhizal. Agaricoid species of Rickenella and related genera are parasites of mosses and liverworts. Distribution of the Hymenochaetales is cosmopolitan. Economic importance Several wood decay fungi in the genera Phellinus and Inonotus sensu lato are pathogenic, causing losses in forestry plantations. Therapeutic properties are claimed for Inonotus obliquus (\\"chaga\\") and Phellinus linteus, both of which are commercially marketed as alternative medicines.

The print edition ceased in 2012, \\"and eWeek became an all-digital publication\\"), at which time Quinstreet acquired the magazine from Internet company Ziff Davis, along with Baseline.com, ChannelInsider.com, CIOInsight.com, and WebBuyersGuide.com. eWeek was started under the name PCWeek on Feb. 28, 1984. The magazine was called PCWeek until 2000, during which time it covered the rise of business computing in America; as eWeek, it increased its online presence and covers more kinds of worldwide technologies. History The magazine was started by Ziff Davis to cover the use of computers as business tools. Team members that started PCWeek included John Dodge, the first news editor; Lois Paul, the first features editor; and Sam Whitmore, the first reporter, who later went on to become editor-in-chief. Chris Dobbrow, who \\"joined Ziff Davis Media ... as the associate publisher of PC Week, ... worked his way up the ladder at Ziff Davis, ... eventually becoming executive vice president.\\" A short story in The New York Times about him said \\"He left in 2000 to join ... Last week, ... landed .. At eWeek. As the publisher. One step above the job he had 15 years ago.\\" At the time, many magazines at the time already covered business computing, such as Datamation and Computerworld. There were also magazines dedicated to hobbyist machines, so it seemed there was no place for a weekly issue to fit in. The first few issues had only 22 pages of advertising, but then PCWeek began establishing itself. By the end of the first year, the average number of advertising pages for the last month was 74.875. Covering The New York Times Twice eWeek had stories about The New York Times having its guard down: * The Times' web site infected computers of on-line subscribers one weekend in 2009 * Midweek, even more visibly that above, the Times' website was down for over two hours, mid- day; the magazine used the word \\"nefarious.\\" An Atlantic magazine titled \\"How Not to Get Hacked Like the New York Times\\" explained how the first hack on the Times worked; the Times reported on a _second_ (same month) hack against NYTimes.com with the headline \\"Times Site Is Disrupted in Attack by Hackers.\\" Buyers' guides John Pallatto, a writer for PCWeek in its first year, produced a full buyer's guide on all DOS-compatible PCs on the market. Early promotional publications from PCWeek show them describing their key audience as \\"volume buyers\\", that is, people and companies that would buy PCs in bulk for business purposes. With this the magazine was able to show big computer companies that advertising in an issue of PCWeek was the best possible way to get their product seen by the biggest and most important buyers. Later success PCWeek grew. Scot Peterson became eWeek's main editor in 2005, having been, a Ziff-Davis employee since 1995, and previously held the title news editor. People involved in between PCWeek's initial success and change to eWeek were David Strom, Sam Whitmore, Mike Edelhart, Gina Smith, Peter Coffee, Paul Bonner, current editor Chris Preimesberger and many others. Jim Louderback, a lab director at PCWeek as of 1991, describes how they were able to \\"get a product in on Wednesday, review it, and have it on the front page on Monday\\" and that \\"that was something we were the first to do\\". In 2012, eWeek and other Ziff Davis assets were acquired by the company QuinStreet, which also runs other tech-oriented publications. Evolution As the whole PC Industry evolved, PCWeek grew, and also developed a very active audience that spoke of their experiences, good and bad. Successor eWeek is even more oriented towards \\"Lab-based product evaluation,\\" and covers a wide range tech topics. =Writers= Among former/current writers are: * Jessica Davis * Scott Ferguson, former Editor in Chief of eWeek, 2006 - 2012 (when eWeek stopped their print edition \\"and eWeek became an all-digital publication\\"). * Todd Weiss, Senior Writer (\\"all things mobile\\") Influence A famous part of PCWeek was the fictional gossip columnist by the name of \\"Spencer F. Katt\\". The column would cover all sorts of rumors and gossip about the PC Industry, and the character of Spencer F. Katt became a famous icon of the entire world of computing. PCWeek had influence on the PC Industry that it covered and the success of business PCs contributed to the success of PCWeek. John Pallatto characterizes the rise of PCs in 1985 as a \\"social phenomenon\\", and says that \\"the most sought-after status symbol on Wall Street in 1985... was the key to unlock the power switch on an IBM PC AT\\". PCWeek was licensed in other countries, notably Australia, where it was first published by Australian Consolidated Press. Towards the end of the 1990s, the title shifted to a publishing partnership between Ziff-Davis and Australian Provincial Newspapers where its final Australian editor was Paul Zucker. One story from PCWeek that is well known is their coverage of \\"the famous 1994 flaw in the numerical processor in Intel's Pentium chip\\". The news they broke on Intel's processor, along with other research, caused Intel to actually pull back and fix their chips before offering new ones. Current editor in chief Chris Preimesberger, who joined eWEEK in 2005 as a free-lancer, now runs a staff consisting of mostly free-lancers, many of whom have worked full time for eWEEK in the past and at other IT publications. The readership has been loyal through the years and now consists mostly of veteran IT professionals, company executives, software developers, investors and other people interested in the ebb and flow of the IT business and trends in products and services. Training After 14 years at PC week, Sam Whitmore started his own firm (Media Survey). The latter, after over 2 decades, began a fellowship to train future reporters.

This federally recognized American Indian tribe has 8,300 enrolled members living on or near 30,000 acres (120 km²) of reservation land in east central Mississippi. Martin had a 40-year record of service to the Tribal government, including 32 years as the Tribe's principal elected official. Chief Martin left office in 2007 after the election of Miko Beasley Denson. Early life Phillip Martin was born in Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1926, to parents who were Choctaw. He grew up in the culture of his people and attended local schools. Career After serving in the US Air Force as a sergeant for a decade, Martin returned to his home in Mississippi. He entered tribal leadership in 1957. He was first elected tribal chief in 1979. Nationally, Martin served as president of the National Tribal Chairmen's Association, and in 1969 founded the United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc. (USET), an association of the 23 federally recognized tribes in the eastern portion of the United States. Martin served as founding president of USET. He was the first president of the Board of Regents of Haskell Indian Junior College (now Haskell Indian Nations University), serving from 1970 to 1976. In that period, Martin worked with other tribal leaders to acquire and maintain accreditation for Haskell, and to improve campus facilities, including construction of dormitories, a cafeteria, resource center, and field house. In 1992, Martin founded the United South and Eastern Tribes Gaming Association. He helped tribes develop gaming facilities on their reservations to generate revenues for tribal welfare, education and income. At the time of his death, the chief presided over the USET Gaming Association. Locally, Chief Martin served the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians on numerous Boards of Directorship. During his tenure as Tribal Chief, Martin was known for developing an industrial park on the reservation, and the \\"$750 million Pearl River Resort, complete with two casinos, a golf club and a water park... He was praised for creating thousands of jobs. He also set up a scholarship that pays 100 percent of college costs for tribal youth.\\" Other Tribal businesses and service operations he established on the Choctaw Indian Reservation include the following: *Pearl River Resort (est. 2000) *Choctaw Resort Development Enterprise (est. 1999) *Choctaw Housing Development Enterprise (est. 1995) *Choctaw Golf Enterprise (est. 1995) *Silver Star Resort and Casino (est. 1994) *First American Plastic Molding Enterprise (est. 1993) *Choctaw Construction Enterprise (est. 1993) *First American Printing and Direct Mail Enterprise (est. 1990) *Choctaw Shopping Center (est. 1988) *Choctaw Residential Center (est. 1987) *Choctaw Manufacturing Enterprise (est. 1986) *Chata Enterprise (est. 1979) *Choctaw Development Enterprise (est. 1969) He wrote a memoir, Chief: The Autobiography of Phillip Martin.

This strategy was a major departure from the conventional normalities of Irish political behaviour, with a bitter division between the two main parties Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael dating back to the Irish Civil War of the 1920s. The strategy was named after a speech given by Fine Gael party leader Alan Dukes to the Tallaght Chamber of commerce on 2 September 1987: Although it did not benefit the party directly – Fine Gael gained only four seats in the 1989 general election, and did not form part of the subsequent government – Fine Gael maintain that this policy of cooperation between the opposition and the government laid the foundations for the Celtic Tiger economic boom of the 1990s – \\"A decision by the Fine Gael opposition to support all moves towards fiscal reform...allowed the fierce spending and tax cuts that began to transform Ireland from a banana republic into a 'Celtic Tiger'.\\" During an RTÉ interview on 7 September 2008, the Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, commenting on the worsening economic situation in Ireland said that Fine Gael \\"would work in the interest of the economy and the people\\" but ruled out a return to the Tallaght Strategy. In October 2010, Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Eamon Ryan of the Green Party, called for a 'Tallaght Strategy Mark Two' in order to pass the 2011 government budget. Fine Gael rejected calls for a new Tallaght Strategy.

Taxonomy There is genetic and behavioural evidence that S. fonscolombii is not closely related to the other members of the genus Sympetrum and it will at some time in the future be removed from this genus.  Etymology Sympetrum fonscolombii was named under the protonym Libellula fonscolombii by the Belgian entomologist Edmond de Sélys Longchamps, in 1840, in honor of the French entomologist Étienne of Fonscolombe (hence the species name).Sélys-Longchamps, de, E. 1840. Monographie des libellulidées d'Europe. Libellula fonscolombii , Librairie Roret, 220 pages, Paris Its name is sometimes spelt fonscolombei instead of fonscolombii but Askew (2004) gives the latter as the correct spelling. Distribution Sympetrum fonscolombii is a widespread and common species in much of central and southern Europe including most Mediterranean islands, North Africa, the Middle East, Mongolia, south-western Asia, including the Indian Subcontinent, the Indian Ocean Islands and Sri Lanka. In Europe it is resident in the south of its range but in some years it migrates northward. From the 1990s onwards has increasingly been found in northwest Europe, including Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Britain and Ireland. It is the only Libellulidae to be found in the Azores and it is also found on the Canary Islands and Madeira. Habitat It breeds in a wide range of habitats including marshes, lakes, ponds, permanent and seasonal rivers. It is able to recolonize dry areas after a rainfall. Identification Sympetrum fonscolombii can reach a body length of .British Dragonfly Society This species is similar to other Sympetrum species but a good view with binoculars should give a positive identification, especially with a male. Males have a red abdomen, redder than many other Sympetrum species. The frons and the thorax are red-brown. The eyes are brown above and blue/grey below. The wings have red veins and the wing bases of the hind-wings are yellow. The pterostigma is pale yellow with a border of black veins. Female are similar but the abdomen is ochre yellow, not red, with two black lines along each side. The wings have yellow veins at the costa, leading edge and base, not red veins as found in the males. The legs of both sexes are mostly black with some yellow. Immature males are like females but often with more red and a single line along each side of the abdomen. Male S. fonscolombii can be mistaken for Crocothemis erythraea as both are very red dragonflies with yellow bases to the wings, red veins and pale pterostigma. However C. erythraea has no black on the legs, a broader body and no black on the head. Also C. erythraea females do not oviposit in tandem. The jizz of these two species is different and with some experience are easy to tell apart.

It is a territorial species with the males often sitting on an exposed perch. After copulation the pair stay in tandem for egg laying and pairs can be seen over open water with the female dipping her abdomen into the water depositing eggs. Pairs are known to fly over the sea in tandem dipping into the salt water where the eggs soon perish. The eggs and larvae develop within a few months and S. fonscolombii unlike most other European dragonflies has more than one generation a year. Some larvae overwinter.

In the film, Shaggy, Scooby, Fred, Velma, and Daphne reunite after a year-long hiatus from Mystery, Inc. to investigate a bayou island said to be haunted by the ghost of the pirate Morgan Moonscar. The film was directed by Jim Stenstrum, from a screenplay by Glenn Leopold. Popularity for Scooby-Doo had grown in the 1990s due to reruns aired on Cartoon Network. The channel's parent company, Time Warner, suggested developing a direct-to-video (DTV) film on the property. The team at Hanna-Barbera consisted of many veteran artists and writers. Much of the original voice actors of the series were recast for the film, although Frank Welker returned to voice Fred Jones. It was also the first of four Scooby-Doo direct-to-video films to be animated overseas by Japanese animation studio Mook Animation. Rock bands Third Eye Blind and Skycycle contribute to the soundtrack. Zombie Island contains a darker tone than most Scooby-Doo productions, and is notable for containing real supernatural creatures rather than people in costumes. The film was released on September 22, 1998, and received positive reviews from critics, who complimented its animation and story. The film is also notable for being the first Scooby production featuring the entire gang (sans Scrappy-Doo) since The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries episode A Halloween Hassle in Dracula’s Castle, which premiered on ABC on October 27, 1984. The film was aided by a $50 million promotional campaign, and sponsorship deals with multiple companies. Sales of the film on VHS were high, and it became the first in a long-running series of DTV Scooby-Doo films. Two decades after the film's release, Warner Bros Animation developed a sequel, Return to Zombie Island, released in 2019. Plot The five members of Mystery, Inc. go their separate ways after becoming bored of mystery solving because culprits are always people in costumes. Daphne Blake, along with Fred Jones, starts running a successful television series. She is determined to hunt down a real ghost rather than a fake one. Fred contacts Velma Dinkley, Shaggy Rogers and his dog Scooby-Doo, and the entire gang is brought back together for Daphne's birthday. They embark on a road trip scouting haunted locations across the U.S. for Daphne's show. After encountering a lot of fake monsters, the gang arrives in New Orleans, Louisiana, fed up by this time. They are invited by a young woman named Lena Dupree to visit her workplace at Moonscar Island, an island allegedly haunted by the ghost of the pirate Morgan Moonscar. Although the gang is skeptical, they decide to go with Lena. On the island, they meet Lena's employer Simone Lenoir, who lives in a large Southern home on a pepper plantation. They also meet the ferryman Jacques and Simone's gardener Beau. Shaggy and Scooby encounter the ghost of Moonscar, who becomes a reanimated corpse, and the gang gets several ghostly warnings to leave. Despite this, they stay overnight, still skeptical. Shaggy sees another ghost, one of a Confederate colonel warning them to leave. That night, Shaggy and Scooby are chased by a horde of zombies. Velma suspects Beau while Fred and Daphne capture a zombie. They believe it is a mask until Fred pulls its head off, revealing that the zombies are real. As the horde chases them, the gang gets split in the chaos and Daphne accidentally causes Fred to drop his video camera in the quicksand, losing film evidence for their show. Shaggy and Scooby discover wax voodoo dolls that look like Fred, Velma, and Daphne in a cave. When they play with the dolls, they involuntarily control the gang's actions with the things they make the dolls do, leaving the gang confused. Shaggy and Scooby drop the dolls and flee when they disturb a nest of bats. The rest of the gang and Beau discover a secret passageway in the house. Lena tells them that the zombies dragged Simone away. The passageway leads to a secret chamber for voodoo rituals, where Velma confronts Lena about her lie: the footprints in the passageway were Simone's; she had walked to the chamber as opposed to being dragged away. Simone and Lena use the voodoo dolls to trap the gang. They and Jacques reveal themselves to be evil cat creatures. Simone tells them that 200 years ago, she and Lena were part of a group of settlers on the island who worshiped a cat god. When Moonscar and his crew invaded the island, they chased the settlers into the bayou, leading them to be killed by alligators, but Simone and Lena escaped the carnage. They prayed to their cat god to curse Moonscar. Their wish was granted and they were transformed into werecats. They killed the pirates, but remained werecats permanently. Every harvest moon, they lure and exploit all the victims by drain lives to preserve their immortality. Jacques became their ferryman to bring them more victims as he wanted to have immortality. The zombies are actually their previous victims (pirates, Confederates, settlers, tourists) who awaken every harvest moon and try to scare people away in order to stop them from suffering the same fate. Shaggy and Scooby disrupt the werecats' draining ceremony. The gang free themselves but the werecats surround them. However, it is too late; the time for the ceremony has passed. Their curse expires and Simone, Lena, and Jacques crumble into dust, allowing the zombies' souls to finally rest in peace. Beau reveals himself to be an undercover police officer who was sent to investigate the numerous disappearances on the island. Daphne asks Beau to guest-star on her show, and they all leave the island in the morning.

Pettigrew (uncredited) Production =Origins and story= Bayou Lafourche in Louisiana The Scooby-Doo franchise, which by the time of the film's release was nearing its 30-year mark, had entered into a period of diminishing returns in the early 1990s. After the conclusion of the sixth iteration of the series, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, the character became absent from Saturday-morning lineups. In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System purchased Hanna-Barbera, the animation studio behind Scooby, largely to fill programming at a new, 24/7 cable channel centered on animated properties: Cartoon Network. The advent of cable gave the franchise renewed popularity: rapidly, Scooby reruns attracted top ratings. Zombie Island was not the first attempt at a feature-length Scooby adventure; several television films were produced in the late 1980s starring the character, such as Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School. In 1996, Turner merged with Time Warner. Davis Doi, in charge at Hanna-Barbera, was tasked with developing projects based on the studio's existing property. Warner executives suggested Scooby, given that the property held a high Q Score, and proposed it could be a direct-to-video feature film. The team assembled to work on the production were veterans of the animation business, and had most recently worked on SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron and The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest. Screenwriter Glenn Leopold had been with the franchise since 1979's Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo. The film was directed by Jim Stenstrum, who had worked on Scooby projects beginning in 1983 The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show. As the film was considered a one-off experiment by studio brass, the crew worked with little oversight and complete creative freedom. Doi and writer Glenn Leopold developed the film's story, with Leopold receiving sole credit for the screenplay. Much of the script is recycled from Leopold's script for the unfinished SWAT Kats episode, \\"The Curse of Kataluna\\". Jim Stenstrum, the film's director, suggested in early story meetings that the monsters in the film be real—previous Scooby outings were nearly always \\"bad guys\\" in rubber masks. Leopold disagreed, noting that throughout the franchise's history, it always remained a simple, solvable mystery. Stenstrum felt this worked for a half-hour television episode, but might grow tiresome over a feature film length. Lance Falk, who worked as model coordinator on the film, suggested they combine both ideas. =Casting= Casey Kasem was originally set to reprise his role as Shaggy, but had recently gone vegan and demanded the character follow suit and cut all meat and dairy from his diet. The creative team found this absurd, given that eating anything and everything was a hallmark of the character for decades. In addition, they had already began production on Zombie Island, which features Shaggy indulging in crawfish and more. The team decided to recast Shaggy with voice actor Billy West. They gave Kasem a last-minute reprieve before recording the film, noting that they could pay-or-play West, though Kasem still refused. Radio personality Scott Innes ended up voicing Scooby-Doo, as Don Messick, the character's original voice actor, died in 1997. Mary Kay Bergman was cast as Daphne, while B.J. Ward, who played Velma in a Johnny Bravo crossover episode, reprised her role for this film. Frank Welker is the only actor from the original series to reprise his role, as Fred Jones. He had initially worried that the producers would replace him as well, given that the producers believed his voice had gone down an octave. The voice director kept requesting Welker perform the voice at a higher pitch. Welker insisted his voice was the same, as Fred's voice is close to his natural speaking voice. The team went back and viewed early Scooby-Doo episodes and found that Welker's impression was more or less the same. Bob Miller, of Animation World Network, suggested that the reruns of Scooby-Doo aired on Cartoon Network perhaps gave them a false idea of the character's voice, as the episodes were typically time-compressed (or sped-up) to allow more room for commercials, thus giving all of the show's soundtrack a higher pitch. =Animation= Japanese animation studio Mook Animation were contracted to work on the film; Doi had a relationship with the team at Mook as they had previously collaborated on Swat Kats and Jonny Quest. Hiroshi Aoyama and Kazumi Fukushima directed the film as well, but are not credited on the picture. The film was animated and is presented in standard 1.33:1 full frame format. The team were allowed more time to work on the film, as there was no real set schedule—just delivery to the home video department upon completion. The American crew re-designed the series cast for the film, giving them an update fashion-wise. The team felt Fred and Daphne, with their ascots and his bell-bottoms, felt particularly out-of-date. They briefly changed Shaggy's shirt color to red and gave him sneakers, though they quickly relented, as they viewed his original outfit as more timeless. The group were trusted by the studio's management as they had worked together for a long time, and all involved on the film had a real passion for the project. Drew Gentle was the main background designer for the project, with Falk contributing to the film's color key. Occasionally, the crew would hire freelance artists to contribute to ancillary designs. In addition, the group enlisted the assistance of Iwao Takamoto—the original designer of Scooby-Doo, still on salary at Hanna-Barbera—for advising on scenes. Takamoto called the film \\"a good solid mystery\\", and storyboarded several sequences of interplay between Shaggy and Scooby. =Music= Composer Steven Bramson, who is known for Tiny Toon Adventures, JAG and the Lost in Space film, scored and conducted the film. The soundtrack for the film features three songs composed specifically for the film. \\"The Ghost Is Here\\" and \\"It's Terror Time Again\\", both written by Glenn Leopold, were performed by Skycycle. The title track, \\"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\\", was performed by Third Eye Blind. Themes This and the following three films had a darker tone than the original animated series (Scooby-Doo, Where are You! and several spinoffs), and the marketing emphasized: \\"This time, the monsters are real.\\" However, it's worth noting that Scooby writers had introduced real supernatural elements into the franchise back in 1980 with the second season of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo, possibly to avoid some of the show's formulaic trappings. In the first segment, \\"A Close Encounter with a Strange Kind,\\" the series takes its first delve into science fiction when Shaggy is abducted by real aliens. In the second segment, \\"A Fit Night Out for Bats,\\" Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy spend the night in a castle with a real vampire and eventually escape from him. No attempt is made at an unmasking, and the characters do not comment on how unusual it is for them to meet a real monster. Supernatural elements would continue to be incorporated through the remaining Scrappy series and through TV movies until Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf (1988). However, there are several notable differences between this production and earlier ones to feature real monsters. First, Fred, Daphne and Velma are all present; they had frequently been absent during the earlier adventures. Second, Scrappy is absent from this story, as he has been in all productions since 1988 (except for comical cameos). Third, this was the first storyline to focus on the gang's surprise at the monsters not being fake. So Zombie Island does at least feature some breaks with tradition. Release The film was released on VHS on September 22, 1998 through Warner Home Video. Because of the cost of production, the tape retailed at $19.95, which was higher than other direct- to-video titles of that era. Sales for the film exceeded the studio's expectations, according to a 1999 Billboard article. It was released on DVD on March 6, 2001, and later re-released in 2008 as a double-feature on DVD alongside the third direct-to-video Scooby film, Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders (2000). The film was aided by a reportedly $50 million promotional push, as advertisers believed the character's iconic nature would generate strong sales, and deserved \\"equal visibility to a theatrical release.\\" Tie-ins included the Campbell Soup Company, SpaghettiOs, 1-800-COLLECT, Wendy's, LEGO, and Cartoon Network, who debuted the film on television on October 31, 1998, after a month themed after the series. It was also promoted as part of the network's \\"Wacky Racing\\" sponsorship deal with Melling Racing in 1998, as the third of four paint schemes featured on the NASCAR Winston Cup Series #9 Ford Taurus driven by then-rookie Jerry Nadeau. The paint scheme debuted at Richmond International Raceway in the Exide NASCAR Select Batteries 400 on September 12, 1998, and was featured on the car through the Dura Lube Kmart 500 at Phoenix International Raceway on October 25, 1998, for a total of seven races out of the thirty-three race schedule. The promotional push was, at the time, the biggest marketing support in Warner Bros. Family Entertainment's history. Reception The film received positive reviews from critics, and currently holds a \\"Fresh\\" rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. Donald Liebenson of the Chicago Tribune described the film as \\"ambitious\\" and calls it \\"a nostalgic hoot [that] resurrects all the touchstones of the original cartoons.\\" Entertainment Weekly Joe Neumaier praised the film as \\"Fast, fun, and filled with knowing winks, the mystery honors the show’s beloved structure, but writ large.\\" A 1998 New York Times article by Peter M. Nichols complimented the film as \\"well-made.\\" Lynne Heffley at the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"more entertaining than you'd expect, despite the familiar Saturday morning-type animation.\\" Later assessments of the film have been similarly positive. Michael Mallory at the Los Angeles Times credited it and its subsequent features for \\"[spinning] the characters into more modern treatments of action and horror, and toyed with [a] self-spoofing quality.\\" In 2011-12, British comedian Stewart Lee dedicated an extensive section of his live show Carpet Remnant World to the 'jungle canyon rope bridges' in Scooby- Doo on Zombie Island,Matthew Bell 'Stewart Lee, Leicester Square Theatre, London' The Independent 27 November 2011 https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/comedy/reviews/stewart-lee-leicester-square-theatre- london-6268415.html linking what he described as the parlous state of such bridges with the neoliberal regime of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.Chris Bell, 'Stewart Lee: Carpet Remnant World' Squeamish Bikini 14 June 2012 https://www.squeamishbikini.com/squeamish-reviews/stewart-lee-carpet-remnant- world Sequel A direct sequel, titled Scooby-Doo!

The technique aims to improve the display of a fast- moving video image — such as a computer game, a DVD, or the signal from a TV card. Most video cards manufactured since about 1998 and most media players support hardware overlay.What is overlay? – Computer Hope The overlay is a dedicated buffer into which one app can render (typically video), without incurring the significant performance cost of checking for clipping and overlapping rendering by other apps. The framebuffer has hardware support for importing and rendering the buffer contents without going through the GPU.  Overview The use of a hardware overlay is important for several reasons: # In a graphical user interface (GUI) operating system such as Windows, one display-device can typically display multiple applications simultaneously. # Consider how a display works without a hardware overlay. When each application draws to the screen, the operating system's graphical subsystem must constantly check to ensure that the objects being drawn appear on the appropriate location on the screen, and that they don't collide with overlapping and neighboring windows. The graphical subsystem must clip objects while they are being drawn when a collision occurs. This constant checking and clipping ensures that different applications can cooperate with one another in sharing a display, but also consumes a significant proportion of computing power. A computer draws on its display by writing a bitmapped representation of the graphics into a special portion of its memory known as video memory. Without any hardware overlays, only one chunk of video memory exists which all applications must share - and the location of a given application's video memory moves whenever the user changes the position of the application's window. With shared video memory, an application must constantly check that it is only writing to memory that belongs to that application. When running a high-bandwidth video application such as a movie player or some games, the computing power and complexity needed to perform constant clipping and checking negatively impacts performance and compatibility. A hardware overlay escapes these limitations. In addition, the graphics processing unit (GPU) provides an efficient way to scale the video in size and often performs color- format conversions (such as MPEG-2's YCbCr into RGB). An application using a hardware overlay gets a completely separate section of video memory that belongs only to that application. Because nothing else uses it, the program never needs to waste resources in checking whether a given piece of the memory belongs to it, nor does it need to monitor whether the user moves the window and changes the location of the video memory. To get the image from the separate video memory to display in tandem with the remaining shared elements on the display, the graphical subsystem associates a certain attribute (for example, a particular color) as a \\"mask\\" for that overlay, which the graphics card understands to mean that it is to draw from the separate overlay buffer onto the screen. (This technique has become known as \\"chroma key\\".) As an example, assume that the graphical subsystem defines the color \\"purple\\" as the mask color that triggers the overlay to appear. An application that plays a DVD will draw a solid purple rectangle on the shared screen, and then \\"play\\" the DVD into the special region of memory dedicated to the overlay. The graphics card will render the DVD playback only inside the purple area. If another window moves over top of the purple area and obscures a part of it, then the graphics hardware performs the clipping by itself. In practice, the actual color \\"purple\\" is not used - rather, either a nondescript near-black color is used (as the system often has thousands of such shades to choose from), or the mask region is denoted using some similar masking method not involving colors. Screen shots As a consequence of hardware overlay use, a screenshot program (for example, the one automatically built into Windows that activates when a user presses the PrtSc key) often does not capture the content appearing in the hardware overlay window. Rather, a blank region containing only the special mask color is captured. This is because the screen capture routine doesn't consider the special video memory regions dedicated to overlays – it simply captures the shared main screen as rendered by the software's graphical subsystem. Secondary displays Many graphics cards can support more than one monitor and/or a TV screen as output devices. Typically one of these output devices has to be declared the \\"primary\\" device, and only the primary device can display hardware overlays. There are exceptions: Intel writes in the FAQ for their Embedded Graphics Drivers that the overlay can be attached to either one of the displays but not to both (note: the Intel 945, G33-Q965 chipsets have dual hardware overlay, and are capable of good quality mpeg2 on secondary monitors when appropriate software is installed), and some newer Matrox graphics card support overlay on both displays (for example, the Parhelia Series). Secondary displays require both hardware and driver support; some graphics cards may support overlay on the second display while their drivers may not yet support it (note: graphics chipset driver bugs can cause most video formats apart from mpeg2 to work on both monitors, and mpeg2 only on the primary with most players). Some users note that DVD movies display properly on a laptop screen but don't display on a TV connected to the laptop; in these cases it may be possible to designate the TV as the primary display. Sometimes, the use of hardware overlays may have to be disabled in the media player. However, some graphics cards have the option to completely redirect hardware overlay to the TV screen. In this case, starting a DVD player on the main screen with overlay enabled would result in video being displayed on the attached TV screen. Implementations in various operating systems Windows Vista's enhanced graphics capabilities replace the basic concept of hardware overlays with full hardware compositing for every application window running on the system, not just movie players or games, through the Desktop Window Manager. Mac OS X has used hardware compositing since the introduction of Quartz Extreme into Mac OS X 10.2. To improve performance, each program draws to its own independent memory buffer instead of to a slow graphical subsystem. (In Windows Vista, each hardware overlay is more correctly known as a Direct3D surface). Then the system's GPU assembles each of the windows into a single display screen in real time. With modern GPUs capable of advanced 3D graphics (as a consequence of the video game industry), operating systems can apply computationally intensive motion, scaling, and lighting effects to normal 2D windows. Due to a need to reduce power consumption, Windows 7 added back limited support for overlays,https://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/dd797814(v=vs.85).aspxhttp://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=249 and Windows 8.1 added support for multi-plane overlays.https://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/dn280344(v=vs.85).aspx Multi-plane overlays allow the Desktop Window Manager to automatically render portions of the desktop into overlays, saving power in more circumstances. In the X Window System, the windowing system of most Unix operating systems, the XVideo extension can allow applications to employ hardware overlays. Compositing is also used, with compiz and Beryl compositing window managers being the most prominent examples since 2006. They are able to take advantage of OpenGL (through glx extension) for 3D and 2D overlay visual effects. Other implementations like Metacity and xfwm have been available since 2004. Some dedicated hardware overlay devices use embedded Linux as an operating system, for example the video logger by Racelogic uses a Texas Instruments DM355 micro-controller to blend a frame buffer containing graphics onto a live video feed, and then store the result in MPEG-4 format on a flash card. Overlay support aka Picture In Picture (PIP) was introduced to AmigaOS with the introduction of the PC graphic cards, Picasso96 and CyberGraphX graphic driver systems aka ReTargetable Graphics, for Picasso IV and Voodoo3 cards, picasso’96 driver system became standard in AmigaOS 3.5. Moovid was one of the first video players that supported hardware overlay (PIP) on AmigaOS.

The demise of the Ottoman Caliphate took place because of a slow erosion of power in relation to Western Europe, and because of the end of the Ottoman state in consequence of the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire by the League of Nations mandate. Abdülmecid II, the last Ottoman caliph, held his caliphal position for a couple of years after the partitioning, but with Mustafa Kemal's secular reforms and the subsequent exile of the royal Osmanoğlu family from the Republic of Turkey in 1924, the caliphal position was abolished. With the establishments of Bektashi and Mevlevi orders, heterodox, syncretic and mystic approaches to Islam like Sufism flourished. History =1362–1517= Since Murad I's conquest of Edirne in 1362, the caliphate was claimed by the Turkish sultans of the Ottoman Empire. =1517–1875= The Battle of Marj Dabiq between the Ottoman and Mamluk armies Commemorative plaque where the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca was signed In 1517, the Ottoman Sultan Selim I defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo in the Ottoman–Mamluk War. The last Abbasid caliph, Al-Mutawakkil III, was brought back to Constantinople as prisoner. There, it is said, Al- Mutawakkil formally surrendered the title of caliph as well as its outward emblems—the sword and mantle of Muhammad—to Selim, establishing the Ottoman sultans as the new caliphal line. And they gradually came to be viewed as the de facto leaders and representative of the Islamic world. From Constantinople, the Ottoman sultans ruled over an empire that, at its peak, covered Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa, the Caucasus, and extended deep into Eastern Europe. Strengthened by the Peace of Westphalia and the Industrial Revolution, European powers regrouped and challenged Ottoman dominance. Owing largely to poor leadership, archaic political norms, and an inability to keep pace with technological progress in Europe, the Ottoman Empire could not respond effectively to Europe's resurgence and gradually lost its position as a pre-eminent great power. In the nineteenth century the Ottoman Empire initiated a period of modernization known as the Tanzimat, which transformed the nature of the Ottoman state, greatly increasing its power despite the empire's territorial losses. Despite the success of its self-strengthening reforms, the empire was largely unable to match the military strength of its main rival, the Russian Empire, and suffered several defeats in the Russo- Turkish Wars. The Ottoman state defaulted on its loans in 1875–76, part of a wider financial crisis affecting much of the globe. The British supported and propagated the view that the Ottomans were Caliphs of Islam among Muslims in British India and the Ottoman Sultans helped the British by issuing pronouncements to the Muslims of India telling them to support British rule from Sultan Selim III and Sultan Abdülmecid I. =Abdul-Hamid II, 1876–1909= Sultan Abdul-Hamid II, who ruled 1876–1909, felt that the Empire's desperate situation could only be remedied through strong and determined leadership. He distrusted his ministers and other officials that had served his predecessors and gradually reduced their role in his regime, concentrating absolute power over the Empire's governance in his own hands. Taking a hard-line against Western involvement in Ottoman affairs, he emphasized the Empire's \\"Islamic\\" character, reasserted his status as the Caliph, and called for Muslim unity behind the Caliphate. Abdul-Hamid strengthened the Empire's position somewhat, and succeeded briefly in reasserting Islamic power, by building numerous schools, reducing the national debt, and embarking on projects aimed at revitalizing the Empire's decaying infrastructure. The coup by the three Pashas in 1909 marked the end of his reign. Western-inclined Turkish military officers opposed to Abdul-Hamid's rule had steadily organized in the form of secret societies within and outside Turkey. By 1906, the movement enjoyed the support of a significant portion of the army, and its leaders formed the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), informally known as the Young Turk Party. The Young Turks sought to remodel administration of the Empire along Western lines. Their ideology was nationalist in character, and was a precursor of the movement that would seize control of Turkey following World War I. CUP leaders presented their ideas to the public as a revival of true Islamic principles. Under the leadership of Enver Pasha, a Turkish military officer, the CUP launched a military coup against the Sultan in 1908, proclaiming a new regime on 6 July. Though they left Abdul-Hamid on his throne, the Young Turks compelled him to restore the parliament and constitution he had suspended thirty years earlier, thereby creating a constitutional monarchy and stripping the Caliphate of its authority. =Counter-coup and 31 March Incident= A counter-coup launched by soldiers loyal to the Sultan threatened the new government but ultimately failed. After nine months into the new parliamentary term, discontent and reaction found expression in a fundamentalist movement, the counter-revolutionary 31 March Incident, which actually occurred on 13 April 1909. Many aspects of this revolt, which started within certain sections of the mutinying army in Constantinople, are still yet to be analyzed. Its generally admitted perception of a \\"reactionary\\" movement has sometimes been challenged, given the results and effects on the young political system. Abdul-Hamid was deposed on 13 April 1909. He was replaced by his brother Rashid Effendi, who was proclaimed Sultan Mehmed V on 27 April. =Mehmed V, 1909–18= With Libya In 1911 Italy warred with the Ottomans over Libya, and Turkey's failure to defend these regions demonstrated the weakness of the Ottoman military. In 1912 Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece formed the Balkan League, an anti-Ottoman alliance that subsequently launched a joint attack on the Ottoman Empire. The ensuing Balkan Wars eliminated what little presence the Ottomans had left in Europe, and only infighting between the Balkan League allies prevented them from advancing into Anatolia. Internally, the Ottomans continued to be troubled by political instability. Nationalist uprisings that had plagued the Empire sporadically for the past fifty years intensified. The masses were growing frustrated with chronic misgovernance and the Ottomans' poor showing in military conflicts. In response, the CUP led a second coup d'état in 1913 and seized absolute control of the government. For the next five years, the Empire was a one-party state ruled by the CUP under the leadership of Enver Pasha (who returned to Constantinople after having served Turkey abroad in various military and diplomatic capacities since the initial coup), Minister of the Interior Talat Pasha, and Minister of the Navy Cemal Pasha. Though the Sultan was retained, he made no effort to exercise power independent of the Young Turks and was effectively their puppet. The Caliphate was thus held nominally by Mehmed V, but the authority attached to the office rested with the Young Turks. World War I As World War I broke out in Europe, the Young Turks struck an alliance with Germany, a move that would have disastrous consequences. The Empire entered the war on the side of the Central Powers in November 1914, and Britain, France, and Russia immediately declared war on Ottoman Empire. During the development of the war, the empire's position continued to deteriorate, and even in the Middle East – the very heartland of the Islamic world – would soon be lost. =Call for Jihad= Though the Young Turks had compelled the Sultan in his capacity as the Caliph to declare a jihad urging all Muslims to resist Allied encroachment on their lands, the effort was largely unsuccessful. The Young Turk government resigned en masse and Enver, Talat, and Cemal fled Turkey aboard a German warship. Sultan Mehmed VI, who was proclaimed Sultan after his brother Mehmed V died of a heart attack in July, agreed to an armistice. The Armistice of Mudros formalizing Ottoman surrender was signed aboard a British warship on October 30, 1918. Allied troops arrived in Constantinople and occupied the Sultan's palace shortly thereafter. Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire By the end of the war, the Ottomans had lost virtually their entire Empire. Hoping to keep his throne and preserve the Ottoman dynasty in some form or another, the Sultan agreed to cooperate with the Allies. He dissolved parliament and allowed an Allied military administration to replace the government vacated by the Young Turks. Khilafat Movement The Khilafat movement (1919–1924) was a political campaign launched mainly by Muslims in British controlled India to influence the British government to protect the Caliphate during the aftermath of World War I. The defeat of the Ottomans and the Allied occupation of Constantinople left the Ottoman state and the Caliphate with no solid basis. The Khilafat movement sought to remedy this. The movement gained force after the Treaty of Sèvres in August 1920, which codified the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire.Encyclopædia Britannica =Abolition= The last caliph Abdülmecid II The Turkish national movement, as the details explained in Turkish War of Independence, formed a Turkish Grand National Assembly, and secured formal recognition of the nation's independence and new borders on 20 Feb, 1923 through the Treaty of Lausanne. The National Assembly declared Turkey a republic on October 29, 1923, and proclaimed Ankara its new capital. After over 600 years, the Ottoman Empire had officially ceased to exist. However, under Allied direction, the Sultan pledged to suppress such movements and secured an official fatwa from the Sheikh ul-Islam declaring them to be un-Islamic. But the nationalists steadily gained momentum and began to enjoy widespread support. Many sensed that the nation was ripe for revolution. In an effort to neutralize this threat, the Sultan agreed to hold elections, with the hope of placating and co-opting the nationalists. To his dismay, nationalist groups swept the polls, prompting him to again dissolve parliament in April 1920. Initially, the National Assembly seemed willing to allow a place for the Caliphate in the new regime, agreeing to the appointment of Mehmed's cousin Abdülmecid as caliph upon Mehmed's departure (November 1922). But the position had been stripped of any authority, and Abdülmecid's purely ceremonial reign would be short lived. Mustafa Kemal had been a vocal critic of the Ottoman House and its Islamic orientation. When Abdülmecid was declared caliph, Kemal refused to allow the traditional Ottoman ceremony to take place, bluntly declaring: In response to Abdülmecid's petition for an increase in his allowance, Kemal wrote: Still, for all the power he had already wielded in Turkey, Kemal did not dare to abolish the Caliphate outright, as it still commanded a considerable degree of support from the common people. Then an event happened which was to deal a fatal blow to the Caliphate. Two Indian brothers, Maulana Mohammad Ali and Maulana Shaukat Ali, leaders of the Indian-based Khilafat Movement, distributed pamphlets calling upon the Turkish people to preserve the Ottoman Caliphate for the sake of Islam.Khilafat movement  Indian Muslim movement  Britannica.com Under Turkey's new nationalist government, however, this was construed as foreign intervention, and any form of foreign intervention was labelled an insult to Turkish sovereignty, and worse, a threat to State security. Kemal promptly seized his chance. On his initiative, the National Assembly abolished the Caliphate on March 3, 1924. Abdülmecid was sent into exile along with the remaining members of the Ottoman House.

Biography He was born on 7 November 1940, in Derry, Northern Ireland to Deward McGirr and Gretta Kerr. He later emigrated to the United States. He first came to prominence in 1966 with a group of fellow Belfast school teachers: Gerry Burns, Finbar Carolan, and John Sullivan, known collectively as The Go Lucky Four, soared to the top of the Irish music charts with Up Went Nelson, maintaining the #1 spot for eight consecutive weeks. From 1967, McGirr taught maths at Farnworth Grammar School in Greater Manchester, England. He continued to sing rebel songs at school concerts and organised school outings to local venues where his group, The Go Lucky Four, performed gigs. In the U.S., McGirr was known for his relentless fundraising for local charities such as the Center For The Disabled' in Albany. In all, McGirr helped raise over $1,000,000 for the Center For The Disabled and families of victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks at the World Trade Center in New York City. He even recorded a song called \\"The Bravest\\" (written by Tom Paxton) in tribute to all of the NYC firefighters who lost their lives during the collapse of the WTC buildings. Most notably, McGirr set a Guinness World Record for endurance singing in 1996 in an effort to raise awareness and money for cerebral palsy, a condition his daughter Mareena was diagnosed with. McGirr owned a pub, Eamonn's, just outside Albany, New York, which was a favorite spot for local Irish-Americans, especially for its weekly open Irish music sessions. It was severely damaged in a fire on 20 June 2005. McGirr was paralyzed after a serious fall in his pub in November 1996. He died on 14 June 2004 in Albany, New York. He was survived by his daughter Mareena and his wife Mary.

The direct holdings of the principality centred around Tiberias, in Galilee proper, but with all its vassals, the lordship covered all Galilee (now Israel) and southern Phoenicia (today Lebanon). The independent Lordship of Sidon was located between Galilee's holdings. The principality also had its own vassals: the Lordships of Beirut, Nazareth, and Haifa. The principality was established, at least in name, in 1099 when Tancred was given Tiberias, Haifa, and Bethsan by Godfrey of Bouillon. In 1101, Baldwin I limited Tancred's power by giving Haifa to Geldemar Carpenel, and Tancred was forced to give up the principality and become regent in Antioch. The principality became the fief of the families of St. Omer, Montfaucon (Falcomberques), and then Bures, and its main seat was in Tiberias; thus it was sometimes also called the Principality of Tiberias or the Tiberiad. The principality was destroyed by Saladin in 1187, although the title was used by relatives and younger sons of the kings of Cyprus (the titular kings of Jerusalem) afterwards, and some of its former holdings were briefly reclaimed by a treaty made during the Barons' Crusade.

Baldwin gave it to Renier Brus, who also ruled the lordship of Assebebe, which was eventually merged with Banias. Renier's daughter married Humphrey II of Toron, who became lord of Banias around 1148. He sold parts of Banias and Chastel Neuf to the Knights Hospitaller in 1157. Banias was merged with Toron until it fell to Nur ad-Din Zangi in 1164, and when it was recovered it became part of the Seigneury of Joscelin III of Edessa (see below). *Renier Brus (1128-1148) *Humphrey II of Toron (1148-1164) *Joscelin III of Edessa ? =Lordship of Toron= The castle of Toron was built by Hugh of St. Omer, second prince of Galilee, to help capture Tyre. After Hugh's death it was made an independent seigneury, given to Humphrey I in 1107. The lords of Toron tended to be very influential in the kingdom; Humphrey II was constable of Jerusalem. Humphrey IV was married to Isabella, Amalric I's daughter (Toron passed into the royal domain during their marriage, and was then captured by Saladin, but its title was returned to Humphrey IV after their divorce). It was also one of the few to have a straight hereditary succession in male line, at least for some generations. The lords of Toron were also connected to the Lordship of Oultrejordain by the marriage of Humphrey III and the maternal inheritance of Humphrey IV. Toron was later merged with the royal domain of Tyre which went to a branch of Antioch, then their heirs from Montfort. Toron was lost in 1266. Toron had two vassals of its own, the Lordship of Castel Neuf and the Lordship of Toron Ahmud. Chastel Neuf was built by Hugh of St. Omer around 1105 but was later given to the Hospitallers, until it fell to Nur ad-Din in 1167. Toron Ahmud remained in the Lordship of Beirut until John of Ibelin sold it to the Teutonic Knights in 1261. For a fuller account of the lordship and the feudal family, see Toron. Lordship of Nazareth Nazareth was the original site of the Latin Patriarch, established by Tancred. It was created as a seigneury in Galilee in 1115.

In 1989, Illinois got its first Big Ten Tournament title and NCAA Tournament appearance since 1963 and repeated both achievements in 1990. Illinois went 111–57 under Garrido. =Texas (1997–2016)= Garrido led Texas to the College World Series four straight years from 2002 to 2005 and won the tournament in 2002 and 2005. In 2006, despite being ranked No. 3 in the nation at the end of the regular season, Texas was defeated at home in an NCAA regional by Stanford. On April 29, 2011, Garrido became the first NCAA Division I coach to reach 1,800 victories as the seventh-ranked Longhorns defeated No. 14 Oklahoma 5–0 in front of 7,339 fans at UFCU Disch–Falk Field. In 2016, Texas had its first losing season since 1998, and the team did not qualify for postseason play for the third time in five years. On May 30, 2016, the University of Texas announced that Garrido had resigned and accepted a position as a special assistant to the athletic director, Mike Perrin.Bien, Calily; Tavarez, Chris. Augie Garrido steps down as Longhorns baseball coach\\". KXAN. May 30, 2016. His record at Texas was 824–427–2. =Legacy= Garrido's teams won five national titles (1979, 1984, 1995, 2002, 2005). He is one of only two coaches, along with Andy Lopez, to lead teams from more than one school (Cal State Fullerton and Texas) to national titles, and is among the most successful college baseball coaches in history. He is the first coach to guide teams to national championships in four different decades. Additionally, Garrido earned 15 trips to the College World Series, including eight at Texas, while garnering National Coach of the Year honors five times (1975, 1979, 1984, 1985, 2002), regional coach of the year accolades following six different seasons (1975, 1979, 1984, 1985, 2002, 2004) and conference coach of the year distinctions on three occasions (1987, 1995, 2002). Garrido's teams won league championships in 20 different seasons. His final coaching record was 1,975–951–9. He earned more wins than any other coach in NCAA baseball history, across all levels, prior to being surpassed by Florida State University's Mike Martin in 2018. Personal Garrido was a friend of actor Kevin Costner from Garrido's days at CSUF (where Costner attended and was cut from the baseball team by Garrido). Costner, who maintains a home in Austin, was occasionally seen at Garrido's practices and games. Garrido played the New York Yankees manager in Costner's movie \\"For Love of the Game.\\" Garrido was a friend of director Richard Linklater, a Longhorn fan. Linklater was often seen taking batting practice with the team while in Austin. In 2008, ESPN2 aired a 2-hour documentary directed by Linklater, titled \\"Inning By Inning: Portrait of A Coach\\", which focused on the life of Garrido, from his childhood to his current job at The University of Texas. American storyteller and adventurer Woodrow Landfair was a player of Garrido's at the University of Texas from 2003 to 2005, serving as the team's bullpen catcher and winning back-to-back Teammate of the Year awards in 2004 and 2005. In a 2007 article in the Austin American-Statesman, Landfair was quoted praising Garrido as both a baseball and a life coach. Landfair claims that Garrido inspired him to pursue a writing career when, after Landfair accepted the team's 2005 National Championship trophy, Garrido told him, \\"Let this be only your first great accomplishment.\\"Austin American-Statesman. On January 17, 2009, Garrido was arrested by Austin police for driving while intoxicated. Police reported that Garrido was driving a Porsche Cayenne west on 6th Street at about 1:00 a.m., when a DWI enforcement officer pulled the coach over since he did not have his headlights on. After taking a sobriety test, Garrido admitted to the officer that he consumed five glasses of wine and was intoxicated. The school suspended him with pay from the first four games of the Longhorns' 2009 season. Garrido publicly apologized, calling his misdemeanor a \\"serious mistake\\". He pleaded guilty to the charge on February 2, 2009, and was sentenced on April 30, 2009. Garrido was a friend of former President George W. Bush from the time Bush was a part owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. Garrido’s curse-laden post game rants became the subject of several YouTube videos. On March 12, 2018, Garrido suffered a stroke. Three days later, he died at the age of 79 in California.Augie Garrido, college baseball's winningest coach, passes away at 79 Head coaching record The following is a table of Garrido's win-loss records as an NCAA head baseball coach.http://www.gopoly.com/sports/bsb/2017-18/files/2018MediaGuideLoRes.pdfhttp://www.fullertontitans.com/sports/m-basebl/2015-16/files/2016_Record_Book.pdf See also * List of college baseball coaches with 1,100 wins References External links * Texas profile * Category:1939 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Vallejo, California Category:Cal Poly Mustangs baseball coaches Category:Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball coaches Category:Charleston Indians players Category:Fresno State Bulldogs baseball players Category:Illinois Fighting Illini baseball coaches Category:San Francisco State Gators baseball coaches Category:Texas Longhorns baseball coaches Category:High school baseball coaches in the United States Category:Burlington Indians players Category:Portland Beavers players Category:Baseball players from California Category:Deaths from cerebrovascular disease Category:National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"Augie Garrido"},{"id":"2081912","text":":see also: 19th century in games, 1910s in games This page lists board and card games published in the 1900s (decade).

From Mpulungu, boats reach DR Congo, Tanzania and Burundi. The MV Liemba ferry sails from Mpulungu to Kasanga and Kigoma in western Tanzania, with connections from there to Bujumbura. Mpulungu is also a fishing port and lies at the end of the old Great North Road.  Transport  In 2007 it was proposed to give Mpulungu rail access with a junction off the TAZARA line at Nseluka.Railways Africa - EXTENDING BEYOND CHIPATA This link plus another between Mpika and Mchinji would greater shorten the rail distance to a deepwater port at Nacala in Mozambique.  History  In the period up to the First World War and for about a decade afterwards, all vessels at the southern end of Lake Tanganyika had to lie offshore at Katuta Bay and unload by lighter or local canoe. This was thought highly unsatisfactory as the SS Liemba was then exposed on a lee shore to storms from the Northerly trade winds which could cause a dangerous sharp swell in the shallow waters of the bay. Also the ship’s derricks could not be used efficiently to unload heavier or bulk cargoes like bags of cement or large oil drums. J.H. Venning, the British South Africa Company Provincial Commissioner in Abercorn – then the Provincial Headquarters – had imported an ex Union Castle Line lifeboat that he used for fishing on the lake. During the course of these expeditions he had come to regard the channel between Kumbula Island and the shore line at Mpulungu as a safe haven. One evening he was discussing the Katuta Bay problem with the Captain of the SS Liemba and mentioned the protected channel. Between them they then formed a plan to take the Governor, who was to visit shortly, on a fishing trip. The fishing expedition duly took place in 1925. Venning took his boat into the channel and they landed and had a splendid picnic provided by the cook of the SS Liemba. When everyone was comfortable and excellent fishing and a good lunch and Champagne been enjoyed, Venning turned to the Captain of SS Liemba and said in as casual a tone of voice “Wouldn’t this make a good place for a harbour?” The Captain then replied with enthusiasm pointing out its many advantages. The Governor, at his ease and relaxed, then asked how much Venning thought it would cost. He probably thought that the cost would be so great that he could rule it out immediately. But Venning said “ Well I think I could fix it up for about £50” While £50 was a considerable sum in those far off days it was still far below a realistic cost. Venning knew that the Governor had discretion to spend £50 on his own say-so without having to go through estimates, budget and treasury procedures. The Governor, maybe by then Sir Herbert Stanley, told Venning to go ahead. Venning knew that, with a little judicious juggling of funds and the use of the prisoners from Abercorn jail, he could construct the 27 mile road on a route he had already surveyed. He later obtain a grant of a further £150 to improve the road bridges, and build a jetty and a Customs warehouse. A Wharf was constructed by Tanganyika Railways in the 1930. This was all completed on “budget” and Mpulungu was founded as the southern Transport Terminus of Lake Tanganyika.Northern Rhodesia Journal Vol. IV, No 3 (1960), pages 289 - 292. and directly for J.H.

The band secured a contract with Tycoon Records after sending a demo tape they had recorded in their hometown—Dublin, Ireland— to a label associate.

The demo was recorded in guitarist Kevin Shields' parents' home in Killiney, South Dublin. Shields and drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig later overdubbed bass and drum tracks at Litton Lane Studios. Upon its release, the album made little impression and the band relocated to London, United Kingdom.

Its course (1) drains a watershed of and comprises challenging whitewater rapids popular with canoers and kayakers, as well as smooth water sections for tubing, and spots for sport fishing. Anglers hail some of those spots as among the best sport fishing in AL. The Locust Fork River ranks in the top 2% of the nation's free flowing rivers with “outstandingly remarkable values” in all seven categories of the Nationwide Rivers Inventory of the National Park Service, (https://www.nps.gov/subjects/rivers/alabama.htm). The Locust Fork is home to the nationally sanctioned annual Locust Fork Canoe and Kayak Races, http://alabamacupraces.com/races.html In the late 1980s, the Birmingham Water Works proposed damming the river as a source of drinking water. When those plans became public, the grass-roots Friends of the Locust Fork River formed to investigate. The group held public meetings and suggested better sources of water for the metropolis. Plans for the dam were finally suspended. History The Locust Fork is an ancient river with a surprising history. The river and its tributaries have carved a path through the surrounding ridges of sandstone and chert at least a dozen times - geological evidence that this river is older than the hills through which it flows. That geology demonstrates that across the millennia as the Appalachians and other uplifts of the land slowly took place, the river cut through. Today it exhibits hairpin curves bordered by steep bluffs, called “entrenched meanders”. Together the river and ridges have created an array of habitats for a distinctively rich diversity of life. In spite of threats, the Locust Fork remains free-flowing, preserving some of that rich bio-diversity, although human activity has caused many extinctions of rare and unusual species. The river provided Native Americans ample food and shelter, resulting in abundant artifacts in the watershed. The river's winding course caused the early white settlers to build many bridges, some of which survive from the past: Swann Covered Bridge https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swann_Covered_Bridge Horton Mill Covered Bridge https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horton_Mill_Covered_Bridge and Easily Covered Bridge Today in Blount County 115 bridges longer than 20 feet currently in operation cross the Locust Fork River. Settlers also built water-powered grain mills in almost every valley. Most of them are gone.

Thatcher (1806-1880). Thatcher was laid down on 20 June 1942 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works Corp.; launched on 6 December 1942; sponsored by Miss Charlotte L. Hyde; and commissioned on 10 February 1943, Lieutenant Commander Leland R. Lampman in command.  1943  The destroyer held her shakedown training in Casco Bay and was then assigned escort duty. She stood out of New York on 29 April with convoy UGF-8 for Casablanca and returned with GUF-8 on 31 May. On 11 June, Thatcher departed the east coast for duty in the Pacific. She joined the Pacific Fleet on the 19th and, after calling at Mare Island Naval Shipyard for armament modifications, arrived at Pearl Harbor on 31 July. On 22 August, Thatcher joined the fast aircraft carrier task group of Rear Admiral Charles Alan Pownall. It steamed toward Marcus Island and launched air attacks against that enemy base on the 31st. The group returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 September. The following week, the destroyer got underway for the New Hebrides and arrived at Espiritu Santo on the 27th. She performed escort duty between Espiritu Santo and Guadalcanal and then screened a resupply convoy to Vella Lavella in mid- October. In late October, Task Force 39 (TF 39), composed of Cruiser Division 12 and Destroyer Divisions (DesDiv) 45 and 46, was assembled at Purvis Bay to support the landings on Bougainville. The force--including Thatcher in DesDiv 46--sortied on 30 October. It bombarded the Buka-Bonis airfields on the night of 31 October and 1 November and then made a high-speed run to the southern tip of the island to shell airfields in the Shortland Islands. After the landings on Cape Torokina on 1 November, TF 39 protected the amphibious forces from enemy interference. That afternoon, TF 39 was ordered to intercept a force of enemy cruisers and destroyers that had left Rabaul to destroy American shipping in Empress Augusta Bay. At 02:27 on 2 November, radar on the American ships showed surface blips at a range of slightly over 35,000 yards (32 km). The Battle of Empress Augusta Bay began when the destroyers of DesDiv 45 fired a salvo of 25 torpedoes at the Japanese ships. However, due to a right turn by the enemy to close and to get into battle formation, all of the torpedoes missed. DesDiv 46--composed of Thatcher, , , and --was protecting the rear of the American formation. These ships held their fire until 03:52 when they launched 19 torpedoes against two Japanese destroyers without scoring. However, the American cruisers had been tallying hits on the Japanese cruiser , which was soon a blazing wreck. During the ensuing melee, Foote was hit by a torpedo that blew off her stern. Spence sideswiped Thatcher, but the resulting damage did not threaten the survival of either ship. Spence signalled Thatcher during the battle: \\"We’ve just had another close miss. Hope you are not shooting at us.\\" Thatcher replied: \\"Sorry. You will have to excuse the next four salvos. They’re already on their way.\\" Thatcher's salvos missed the Spence but sank the Japanese destroyer . Finally, Spence took a hit below the water line that let salt water contaminate her fuel oil. While the Japanese lost Sendai and Hatsukaze, the United States suffered no total losses as Foote was towed to port and repaired. The next day, the Japanese attacked TF 39 with over 100 aircraft. They lost over 20 planes while scoring two hits on . A closer inspection of Thatcher revealed that her collision with Spence had sprung her starboard shaft and had caused extensive dishing of her starboard side amidships. She steamed to Purvis Bay and was routed onward to Nouméa where the misaligned screw was repaired. She then returned to Espiritu Santo where she received orders to proceed to the United States for further repairs. On 20 November, Thatcher got underway as an escort for , and the ships arrived at San Francisco on 14 December 1943. After her damage had been corrected at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Thatcher stood out of San Francisco on 11 February 1944 and steamed to Pearl Harbor for refresher training before rejoining TF 39 on 14 March.  1944  The task force covered the unopposed landings on Emirau Island on the 20th. On 26 March, Thatcher was reassigned to TG 58.3 of the Fast Carrier Task Force. She escorted the carriers as their aircraft flew strikes against Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai in the Caroline Islands from 30 March to 1 April. The task group then retired to the Marshall Islands to prepare for their next assault against Japanese bases. On 13 April, Thatcher escorted the fast carriers to New Guinea as they launched strikes against Hollandia, Wakde, Sawar Airfield, and Sarmi on the 21st and 22d to support the landings for Operations Reckless and Persecution. On 29 April, aircraft from the carriers began a two-day attack against Truk, Ponape, and Satawan. On 1 May, Thatcher was in the screen of the bombardment group that shelled Ponape. Thatcher returned to Majuro on 4 May to enter a floating drydock for repairs. She returned to sea late in the month for refresher training and firing exercises. On 26 May, her number 3 5 inch gun accidentally fired into her starboard midships 20 mm mount, killing five men and causing considerable structural damage. Repairs were completed in time for the destroyer to accompany TG 58.4 to the Mariana Islands. While operating with the group near Saipan on 12 June, Thatcher and were ordered to rescue some aviators in the water near Pagan Island. The two destroyers closed to within five miles of the enemy-held island before reaching the pilots. It was shortly before dark and, as Charles Ausburne was picking them up, Thatcher investigated a ship which had been sighted about six miles northward. She found a small wooden freighter and took it under fire. The size of the fires which broke out on the target and the subsequent explosions indicated that her cargo was oil and ammunition. Survivors in the water refused the lifelines thrown to them. Thatcher rejoined her sister destroyer, and they made a sweep of the island seeking further targets. They soon made radar contact, and both ships began firing at 12,000 yards (11 km) but observed no hits. When they had closed the range to 4,700 yards (4.3 km), Ausburne fired star shells which revealed a ship similar to the vessel Thatcher had sunk. She then fired another salvo which set the ship afire. The destroyers found no other targets before they rejoined the task group the next morning. The carriers conducted air strikes against the Bonin Islands on 15 and 16 June and returned to the Saipan area. On 18 June, when TF 58 prepared for a major battle with the Japanese fleet, Thatcher's group took station on the northern flank of the force. During the ensuing action--later referred to as the \\"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\"--only a few Japanese planes broke through the American fighter cover, and they caused no damage. Meanwhile, the Japanese lost over 300 aircraft. The next day, Thatcher and TG 58.4 were detached from the westward- moving task force to refuel and to continue strikes against Rota and Guam. In the early morning of the 20th, carrier aircraft of the group shot down 18 enemy planes and destroyed 52 more on the ground. On 27 June, Thatcher was with the destroyer squadron that was detached to accompany and on a bombardment mission against Rota and Guam. Thatcher and two other destroyers shelled Rota, setting fire to a sugar mill and other buildings, and then joined the other ships off Guam to bombard airfields, shipping, storage tanks, and other worthwhile targets. Thatcher shelled the same islands again three days later and continued the operation through 1 July. She returned to Eniwetok on 6 July with the task group and remained there for a week before heading back toward the Marianas. The destroyer served with TF 58 until 2 August when she was detached to join Admiral William Halsey's 3d Fleet at Eniwetok. She then joined TG 30.8, the fleet oiler and transport group established to support the 3d Fleet. The ship stood out of Eniwetok on 26 August with several oilers and arrived at Seeadler Harbor on the 31st. She spent the next three months with various units of the group as it provided fuel, mail, and planes for TF 38\\\\. They first operated in the vicinity of Palau and Yap when the carriers struck west of the Carolines. TG 30.8 then moved to Ulithi as the carriers shifted their strikes westward to the Philippines and Formosa. Thatcher then joined TG 38.3 for operations in the Philippine Islands. On 14, 15, and 16 December, the carriers launched strikes against Luzon to support the landings on Mindoro. The group retired to refuel, but the rapidly falling barometer indicated a typhoon approaching. Thatcher was fueled to 50% capacity before the hoses parted due to rough seas. The task force attempted to steam out of the danger area but was near the center of the storm on the 17th and 18th. Three United States destroyers were lost. When the weather cleared and the fleet reassembled, Thatcher joined TG 30.8, a supply group, and served with it until 7 January 1945.  1945  On 8 January, Thatcher joined a special fueling group composed of six of the fastest oilers, two escort carriers, and eight destroyers to conduct fueling operations in the South China Sea for the fast carriers. They accompanied the fast carriers into the South China Sea and took station midway between the Philippines and the coast of Indochina. The destroyer remained on station until the 20th when she headed for Guam with a group of empty oilers. Arriving at Apra Harbor on the 27th, she left for Ulithi and the Philippines the following week. Thatcher joined the 7th Fleet at Leyte on 10 February and, three days later, escorted a convoy to Subic Bay. From 19 February to 3 March, the destroyer provided fire support for the Army forces ashore. Following two weeks of escort duty, the destroyer joined TG 78.3, the Visayan Attack Group. The group sailed on 15 March and headed directly to the landing beaches on the south coast of Panay. Thatcher was off the landing beaches on 18 March and fired her only bombardment of the day against two groups of Japanese cut off by guerrillas in villages near the assault area. The 40th Infantry Division landed at 09:00 and met very little opposition. As Army troops landed at Negros Occidental on the 29th, the destroyer assisted with call fire and continued the task until 5 April when she was relieved. She refitted at San Pedro to prepare for action in the Ryūkyūs. Fate On 13 May, Thatcher got underway for Kerama Retto, near Okinawa. The destroyer was assigned to radar picket duty to detect and intercept enemy aircraft before they could enter the transport anchorages. On 20 May, she detected large numbers of Japanese aircraft approaching the anchorage. All ships opened fire, and Thatcher maneuvered to bring all batteries to bear on the attacking planes. As a low-flying Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscar\\" fighter passed down her port side, she increased her speed to 25 knots (46 km/h) and commenced firing with her 20 mm and 40 mm guns. The kamikaze climbed steeply, did a wing-over, and dived into the destroyer, striking her aft of the bridge. All power and steering control on the bridge were lost; both radars and the gyro system were out; all external communications were lost; and there was a six- by nine-foot hole between the keel and the bilge. and came alongside to remove the wounded and help extinguish fires. With 14 killed or missing and 53 wounded, the stricken ship limped into Kerama Retto. Thatcher awaited drydock entry until 1 July. On the 13th, she was ready for sea and had to ride out a typhoon in Buckner Bay. On the 19th, a kamikaze slipped into the bay and dived on the destroyer. His aim was not as accurate as his predecessor, and he bounced off the port side, above the water line, to explode and burn alongside. Damage was slight, and only two men were wounded. Thatcher got underway for the United States on 25 July. After calling at Ulithi, Majuro, Eniwetok, Johnston Island, and Hawaii, she arrived at Bremerton, Washington on 20 August. A survey board decided that the ship should be scrapped, and she was decommissioned on 23 November 1945. Thatcher was struck from the Navy List on 5 December 1945 and sold on 23 January 1948 to the Lerner Co., Oakland, California, for scrap. Honors Thatcher was awarded 12 battle stars for World War II service.

Sidon was captured in December, 1110 and given to Eustace I Grenier. The lordship was a coastal strip on the Mediterranean Sea between Tyre and Beirut. It was conquered by Saladin in 1187 and remained in Muslim hands until it was restored to Christian control by German Crusaders in the Crusade of 1197.

It runs from Asilomar State Beach in Pacific Grove to U.S. Route 101 in Salinas. The approximately long highway serves as a major route between the Monterey Peninsula and Salinas. Route description SR 68 westbound concurrent with SR 1 southbound in Monterey SR 68 eastbound approaching the Monterey Peninsula SR 68 begins as Asilomar Avenue in the city of Pacific Grove at an intersection with Sinex Avenue, at the entrance to Asilomar Conference Grounds of Asilomar State Beach. The highway continues south to an intersection with Sunset Drive, turning east on Sunset Drive before continuing south after roughly half a mile onto Forest Avenue. Soon after entering Monterey and passing by the Presidio of Monterey, SR 68 becomes the W.R. Holman Highway until its junction with SR 1 at the terminus of the 17 Mile Drive. SR 68 is concurrent with SR 1 for until nearing the Monterey County Fairgrounds. At this point, SR 68 exits SR 1 onto the Monterey-Salinas Highway, which is a freeway for the first half mile. The freeway becomes a highway and passes by the Monterey Regional Airport, intersecting SR 218 at Del Rey Oaks, continuing for towards Salinas. The route goes past Pasadera, WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca, Laureles Grade, Corral De Tierra, San Benancio, Toro Park and Spreckels, becoming a freeway for the last before Salinas, eventually turning north. At the city limits, SR 68 becomes South Main Street and continues to downtown. SR 68 makes a right off of Main and follows John Street to its terminus at U.S. Route 101. Highway 68 is heavily traveled. The road has a design capacity of 16,000 vehicles per day. As of 2006, it carries about 26,000 vehicles per day. This figure is projected to increase as residential development in and around Salinas continues, and the Monterey Peninsula's tourism economy continues to expand. The Monterey- Salinas Highway is the main connector between Monterey and Salinas. The Holman Highway is the main connector between Pacific Grove and Carmel. Highway 68 and the \\"68\\" road symbol have become iconic in Pacific Grove skating culture. This association developed after the opening of the skate shop \\"68 Skate\\". SR 68 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and east of SR 1 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 68 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System; however, only the part from SR 1 to the Salinas River is designated by Caltrans as a scenic highway. The Monterey-Salinas Highway is a California Scenic Route because of its views of the chaparral and springtime lupin for between State Route 1 in Monterey to the Salinas River. State Route 68 is part of the Juan De Anza Trail.Trails and Roads: De Anza Trail last retrieved March 6, 2007. History Highway 68 is part of the DeAnza Trail, a route that linked all of California's mission settlements during the Spanish colonial period. With the advent of the automobile, Highway 68 was upgraded from a dirt wagon road to a 2-lane paved road in 1937.California Highway 68, America's Lost Roads During the 1950s and 1960s, Caltrans had planned to upgrade Highway 68 to a freeway between Salinas and Highway 1 in Monterey, that was to start at US 101 south of the city and proceed west between Salinas and Spreckels, serving as a bypass for Salinas. The freeway was to then follow the existing Highway 68 alignment into Monterey. The freeway plan died as a result of environmental concerns along the route. The only portions of this freeway that were actually built were a section approaching the Highway 1 interchange in Monterey, and a segment starting in Spreckels and heading west, bypassing the unincorporated village of Toro Park. The segment around Spreckels opened in 1967 and included a pair of new bridges spanning the Salinas River, which replaced an old truss bridge built in 1889. At the western terminus of the Spreckels freeway segment, land acquired for the freeway can still be seen. There continues to be discussions, but no definitive plans, to either bypass Route 68 or convert the existing road to 4-lanes by building a second roadway alongside the present 2-lane carriageway. Caltrans and Monterey County officials mention the most practical route for a bypass would be to the north of the existing Route 68, through Fort Ord. A major upgrade of the Highway 68 corridor would cost on the order of $300 million. In the fall of 2007, Caltrans is scheduled to begin a $6 million project to implement safety upgrades at three major intersections along Highway 68. Meanwhile, Caltrans and Monterey County are proceeding with a plan to divert Monterey-Salinas traffic away from Highway 68 by converting Davis Road and Reservation Road from two lanes to four between Highway 101 on the north side of Salinas and Highway 1 in Marina. These two roads pass through Fort Ord and the upgrades are using excess land set aside following the base's closure in 1994. The Davis Road/Reservation Road upgrade is a short-term fix, and most state and county officials realize that a permanent fix for Highway 68 will eventually be necessary.

This movement became distinct from other Holiness bodies in the mid-20th century amid disagreements over modesty in dress, entertainment, and other \\"old holiness standards\\" reflective of the related emphases on the Wesleyan–Arminian doctrine of outward holiness or the Quaker teaching on the testimony of simplicity or the River Brethren teaching on nonconformity to the world, depending on the denomination.Sidwell, Mark, \\" Conservative Holiness Movement: A Fundamentalism File Report\\". History tabernacle of Flatwoods Reformed Free Methodist Campground, which served as the location of the annual camp meeting of the Reformed Free Methodist Church, one of the earliest denominations of the conservative holiness movement. Grace Wesleyan Methodist Church is a parish church of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and is located in Akron, Ohio. The Holiness movement was largely contained within mainline Methodism during the 19th century, with some members of the holiness movement continuing to remain in the mainline Methodist Churches to this day (the \\"stay-inners\\"). Wesleyan- Holiness doctrine influenced adherents of other denominations as well. By the 1880s a persistent wave of \\"come-outism\\" was beginning to gather steam. The come-outers were concerned that mainline Methodism had begun to water-down Holiness teachings and even shun its more outspoken proponents. The majority of the denominations which now comprise the Conservative holiness movement were once among a number of Holiness movement groups which had a history of coming out or having left mainline Methodism to teach and practice Holiness doctrine uninhibited. The denominations that left the mainstream holiness movement and mainline Methodism to form the conservative holiness movement did so because they saw a relaxation of the prohibitions on certain behaviours that they considered to be \\"worldly\\". The list of prohibitions varies from denomination to denomination, but the prohibitions include the wearing of gold (which includes wedding rings), television in the home (an extension to previous bans on theater patronage), women not cutting their hair (in accordance with historic interpretations of I Corinthians 11), the prohibition of women wearing short skirts, wearing short sleeves (most recommending the sleeve to be at or below the elbow), not wearing shorts, the avoidance of bowling alleys and skating rinks, and of professional sports, especially on the Sunday Sabbath. Members of denominations in the conservative holiness movement also practice temperance and teetotalism, thus abstaining from alcohol and other drugs. Each major denomination enforces some of the disciplines listed above, so there is some variation amongst the groups. It is these disciplines that define the conservative holiness movement. The Holiness movement, for the most part, huddled together tightly from its early history to later when Pentecostalism was competing for the hearts and minds of its adherents. During the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and onward, most Holiness groups found themselves at home in the Fundamentalist camp or allied with them. While many Holiness groups made the jump toward the Evangelical movement in the late 1930s, there were groups that felt their Holiness peers were drifting away from Biblical inerrancy and cultural separation. The Reformed Free Methodist Church left the Free Methodist Church in 1932 and the Emmanuel Association left the Pilgrim Holiness Church in 1937—both schisms were due to what the departing bodies perceived as a laxity in traditional doctrine and standards. Samuel West spearheaded the formation of the Reformed Free Methodist Church, which held its annual Flatwoods Camp Meeting in Perryopolis, Pennsylvania; the RFMC emphasized the traditional Methodist doctrine of plain dress. The Emmanuel Association, belonging to the subgroup of \\"Holiness Pacifists\\" in the conservative holiness movement, is known for its opposition to warfare and its holiness standards are codified in a manual known as \\"Principles of Holy Living\\". By the post-World War II era, a more relaxed societal attitude toward morality and theological differences continued to accompany many mainstream Holiness conferences, districts and local churches reinforcing longstanding prohibitions on behavior in their governing documents. Not at home with other Fundamentalist alliances (which had a more Calvinistic and non-Holiness tone to them), an Interdenominational Holiness Convention (IHC) Interdenominational Holiness Convention. was called at a Wesleyan Methodist campground in Fairmont, Indiana, in 1951. Entire sanctification (in Methodism) or Perfectionism (in Quakerism), as well as traditional holiness strictures on dress and entertainment, held a prominent place in convention sermons. The swelling divorce rate, the relentless spread of Communism (with its promotion of state atheism), and the effects of television on society were also prominent themes.Leonard Sankey, “Let’s Talk Dayton Convention,” Convention Herald, May–June 1999 Participants resisted a call to form a new denomination, but became an ally toward a series of prior and future institutional secessions. In 1955 the Bible Missionary Church (BMC) was formed in Idaho and soon grew nationwide as local congregations left the Church of the Nazarene over \\"worldliness\\" issues. In 1963, another schism in the Free Methodist Church led to the formation of the Evangelical Wesleyan Church (EWC). In 1963, the Pilgrim Holiness Church of New York seceded from the Pilgrim Holiness Church to become an independent organization (in 1966–68, the Wesleyan Methodist Church and the Pilgrim Holiness Church proposed a merger to form the Wesleyan Church, which has more in common with the Evangelical Holiness movement churches such as the Nazarene Church). In the wake of the Wesleyan Church merger, the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches, the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection of Churches, the Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee (Tennessee Bible Methodists), the Bible Methodist Connection of Alabama (Alabama Bible Methodists), Bible Methodist Connection Mid-America (formed in 2018), Bible Covenant Church, Pilgrim Holiness Church (Midwest Conference), International Conservative Holiness Association, Pilgrim Nazarene, Wesleyan Nazarene, Emmanuel Missionary Church, Bible Holiness Church, and Wesleyan Holiness Association were organized. As of August 2019 the Pilgrim Nazarene Church (PNC) voted to join the Bible Methodist Connection. While not all the churches took part in the merger it is estimated that approximately two-thirds of the PNC churches left to join the Bible Methodist Connection. The Brethren in Christ Church, a River Brethren denomination that emerged out of Radical Pietism, entered into a schism in 1963 resulting in the formation of the Calvary Holiness Church, a conservative holiness denomination which continues to emphasize traditional River Brethren beliefs, such as the wearing of a headcovering by women, plain dress, temperance, footwashing, and pacifism. Other constituent bodies include: Church of God (Holiness); the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends that emerged among Quakers emphasizing George Fox's doctrine of perfectionism; and God's Missionary Church, formed by individuals affected by local revival meetings. Social change constantly confronts Conservative Holiness Christians. The Church of God (Holiness) in 1999 removed a ban on owning televisions, urging charity over “the ownership or use of television, videos, movies, the internet, and such like.” Other denominations in the conservative holiness movement, such as the Evangelical Wesleyan Church, continue to forbid the watching of television.I.

The band has released six full-length studio albums with their most recent studio album, Blood Money Part 1, being released on October 28, 2016. The lineup currently consists of founding member and lead singer Edsel Dope, guitarist Virus, bassist Acey Slade, and drummer Daniel Fox. History =Early days (1997–1998)= The band was founded in 1997 by songwriter and lead vocalist Edsel Dope. As a child, Edsel and his brother Simon Dope were separated when their parents divorced. When the two were adults, they reunited and Simon joined Edsel's band, playing keyboards, samples and percussion. The pair then recruited Tripp Eisen as guitarist, Preston Nash as drummer, and Acey Slade as bassist. Unlike many of the popular bands from the 1990s, Dope derived their sound from influences taken from heavy metal bands and fused that with the sound of industrial rock acts who had made waves earlier in the decade, such as Ministry and Skinny Puppy. In their earliest days, the band sold drugs to survive and purchase instruments. Furthermore, the band name \\"Dope\\" refers to heroin, which was the common substance Edsel and Simon sold around the New York City area as shown by their early T-shirt designs, which prominently displayed hypodermic needles. The band also had some early connections with fellow rockers Marilyn Manson; ex drummer Ginger Fish shared an apartment with Edsel Dope in Las Vegas during the earlier 1990s, before either of them were in their respective bands. Also, guitarist Zim Zum allowed the band to claim that they were \\"currently being produced by Zim Zum\\" on the cover of their promotional discs to help them gain a record deal. It was originally planned that Zum would produce their debut. However, he was busy recording the album Mechanical Animals at the time. Lead singer Edsel has also maintained a good friendship with ex-Manson guitarist Daisy Berkowitz. =Felons and Revolutionaries (1999–2000)= Felons and Revolutionaries was created after performing on the New York City club circuit, and releasing several promotional cassettes the band was signed by Epic Records. For the album's recording, Sloane Jentry had left the band and Tripp Eisen moved to guitar, while Acey Slade was brought in on bass. The album featured fourteen tracks including two covers, which were; \\"Fuck tha Police\\" by N.W.A and \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" by English new wave band Dead or Alive, which featured in the movie American Psycho. \\"Debonaire\\" was also featured on the Scream 3 movie soundtrack and the first The Fast and the Furious movie during the police raid on Johnny Tran's house scene. Dope toured extensively, taking part in several national tours with various acts ranging from Alice Cooper to Kid Rock. This helped Felons and Revolutionaries SoundScan more than 250,000 units in total. A live video for the song \\"Sick\\" was recorded to capture the energy of the group's live show. The first single and non-live promotional video released by the band from the album was \\"Everything Sucks\\", which failed to chart. The second single, a cover of \\"You Spin Me Round\\", saw the band gaining more attention; it received radio play and reached No. 37 on the US Mainstream Rock charts. =Life (2001–2002)= After the relative success of their debut album, Dope decided to record a follow up entitled Life. Several band changes had taken place once more; Tripp Eisen was fired from the group and joined industrial metal band Static-X, so Virus, a guitarist/producer from New York City who was originally hired for bass, replaced him on guitar in 2000. Acey Slade was moved to the position of guitar, while Sloane Jentry (who had remained friends with the band) rejoined, this time on bass. On drums, Preston Nash was replaced by Racci \\"Sketchy\\" Shay. The two singles from Life; \\"Now or Never\\" and \\"Slipping Away\\" reached No. 28 and No. 29 on the Mainstream Rock charts respectively. The album itself reached No. 180 on the Billboard charts and No. 6 on the Top Heatseekers, which up until that point was the band's highest charting. After the album's release, Simon Dope left the group to pursue a career as a video game producer. \\"Debonaire\\" from the first album was used in the movie The Fast and the Furious. More soundtrack work was done by Dope in 2002, as the band recorded WWE chairman Vince McMahon's theme song \\"No Chance (In Hell)\\" for the WWF Forceable Entry audio release. Dope's music had previously been used as the background theme in ECW, and Rhino also used \\"Debonaire\\" as his entrance theme. Around this period, Edsel Dope also had a public rivalry with the band Murderdolls, particularly vocalist Wednesday 13. An early version of that group had featured Racci Shay on drums; and under the name Murderdolls, it featured Tripp Eisen. Dope guitarist Acey Slade then left the band to join Murderdolls in mid-2002. =Group Therapy and American Apathy (2003–2007)= Disappointed with the label's perceived lack of promotion for the album, the band left Epic and joined Artemis Records, a New York independent record label. Dope's third studio album was titled Group Therapy. A song from that album, Today is the Day served as the official theme song for WWE's pay-per-view event No Mercy 2003 in October. By 2005, Dope had regrouped once more, the band had a new bassist, Brian \\"Brix\\" Milner (former guitarist and keyboardist for Orlando's Skrape). For their new album entitled American Apathy, the band returned to a harder sound similar in some respects to their debut, in an industrial metal style. Although released eight years after the band formed, four albums in and on an independent label, American Apathy performed well in the charts. It was a No. 1 hit on the Top Heatseekers chart, for the first time in the band's history and it also saw the band's highest charting on the Billboard chart to date. Ben Graves of the Murderdolls joined Dope as the live drummer on a tour of Japan. In 2006 Dope bassist Brix Milner played in Murderdolls front man Wednesday 13's solo band, replacing the injured Kid Kid. Edsel Dope and Virus became involved in an alternative pop/rock side-project called Makeshift Romeo. =No Regrets (2008–2012)= No Regrets is the band's fifth studio album. The album was released on March 10, 2009. The album debuted at No. 88 with 6,200 copies sold in its first week, making it the highest-charted album in the band's history. This CD is different from past releases in that the name of the CD is repeated in many of the songs, including \\"Dirty World,\\" \\"My Funeral,\\" \\"We Are,\\" and the CD's title track. \\"Addiction\\" is the third single from the album. The song features a guitar solo by the guest musician Zakk Wylde. Dope has finished their spring tour of the United States, the tour, which took place over two months, included 22 dates. Tripp Lee played live on bass with the band (although Brix is still listed, and seems doubtful that he will return) and a new drummer named Angel Bartolotta, formerly of Pig and The Genitorturers has joined. It was announced on October 15, 2008 that the first single from No Regrets is called \\"Violence\\". The song is currently available to listen on the band's MySpace. There will be a music video, for \\"Violence\\", according to the image the band set for album art. One of the tracks for the album was released in late 2007 in the game, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Guitar Hero III includes a song by Dope called \\"Nothing for Me Here\\" on the bonus list and mentions that it will be on the band's upcoming album. Some time in early 2009, Dope updated their official website, which now features promotion for No Regrets, which was released on March 10, 2009. Previews of eight tracks from the new album can be heard via the music player on the site. In addition to this, the full music video for the single Addiction, which features Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society and well-known guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne is available to be viewed on the site. One of the tracks on the new album is a cover of the Billy Idol single, \\"Rebel Yell\\". On July 29, 2008, Dope released American Apathy Reloaded—a CD of remixes and alternate versions of songs from American Apathy, plus a live DVD. Dope has released a video to go along with the second single on the album, \\"6-6-Sick\\". The song \\"Nothing for Me Here\\" is featured in the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock as a bonus track, therefore making the song's original release date in 2007, 2 years before No Regrets was released. Virus, the lead guitarist, teaches guitar/bass at the Paul Green School of Rock in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania. Virus also produces up-and- coming bands and writes music for TV and video game companies such as Activision, Disney and ESPN. In 2011, Dope performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos. On August 12, 2011, Dope played at Mojoes in Joliet, Illinois. In 2012, Virus joined David Draiman's band Device. =Blood Money (2013–present)= On the September 19, 2013, the band officially released a teaser for the song \\"Drug Music\\" from their upcoming sixth studio album, entitled \\"Blood Money\\" via their Facebook page. The album was originally set to be released in March 2014. However, in an interview with Dee J. Nelson, it was said that the release will take place in the summer. The music video for the album's first single \\"Selfish\\" was released on August 26, 2014 as frontman Edsel Dope announced that Blood Money will be a two-part album. In 2015, Dope announced the dates for the \\"Die Mother Fucker Die\\" reunion tour, featuring the classic lineup of Edsel Dope, Virus, Acey Slade, and Racci Shay. Dope also recorded their very first live album in Moscow which featured the four long time friends and bandmates. Dope's live album, titled \\"Live In Moscow\\", was released in 2016 summer via a fan-funded process through their website where all those who pre-ordered the live album and/or contributed to the fundraiser would have their name listed in the album's liner notes and would subsequently make the website's virtual thermometer grow as fans shopped around the website. The Thermometer would display the overall progress in reaching various fundraiser goals such as the release of the live DVD and making it to United Kingdom and Europe for a tour. After the release of their first live album, the band announced that they will be releasing their long-awaited album \\"Blood Money, Part 1\\" in the autumn of 2016, also stating that the second part of \\"Blood Money\\" would not see such lengthy delays as Part 1 did. Dope released the official music video for the two-part album's title track \\"Blood Money\\" on July 16, 2016. The band released the second single on the album entitled \\"Hold On\\" on August 26, 2016, as well as the official music video. Blood Money part 1 was officially released worldwide on October 28, 2016 via eOne Entertainment. After the release of \\"Blood Money, Part 1,\\" Dope went to tour Russia and the United Kingdom as the headlining act as well as having toured with the classic lineup featured in the \\"Die Mother Fucker Die Reunion\\" tour. This reunion tour had guitarist Virus, drummer Racci Shay, and bassist Acey Slade return for the occasion. In the beginning of 2017, Dope released tour dates for Spring 2017, touring with co-headliner Combichrist and supporting acts September Mourning and Davey Suicide. They also released more tour dates for Fall 2017, this time touring with Hed PE. In 2019, Dope toured with Static-X, DevilDriver, Wednesday 13, and Raven Black in the US. Around the EU, Dope are to tour with Static-X, Soil and Wednesday 13 Musical style and influences Dope have been described as alternative metal, (November 4th, 2009) speed metal, nu metal, and industrial metal. Dope's influences include Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, Kiss, Guns N' Roses, White Zombie, and Mötley Crüe. (September 1st, 2005) Dope's lyrics are known for being obscene and aggressive. In a review of Dope's album Felons and Revolutionaries, NME said \\"In American Pie, a boy puts his cock in an apple pie, to let us know that there's something rotten at the heart of the American Dream. Ex-con brothers Edsel and Simon Dope, though, would probably put someone else's cock in the apple pie, cut it off, lace the pie with strychnine, and serve it up at the Clinton dinner table.\\" (September 12th, 2005) Members Current * Edsel Dope – lead vocals (1997–present), rhythm guitar (1997–2000, 2002–present), keyboards, programming (2002–2017, 2017–present) * Virus -

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, Edinburgh, p. 61; History The band was formed in 1976 by four high school friends from Finchley, North London: Anglo-Egyptian singer and guitarist Andy Blade (real name: Ashruf Radwan),Punk Profiles: An Inside View With Andy Blade (Eater). May 2003 guitarist Brian Chevette (real name: Brian Haddock) and Blade's brother, drummer Social Demise (real name: Lutfi Radwan). The band's name came from a line in the 1970 T. Rex song \\"Suneye\\"; Eater later recorded a cover version of T-Rex's \\"Jeepster.\\" Eater were known for being one of the youngest bands, if not the youngest band, in the punk scene. They were 14–17 years old when they formed the group. \\"They were basically young kids, striving to master their instruments and out to shock\\", according to Up Yours! A Guide to UK Punk, New Wave & Early Post Punk.Joynson, V. (2001) Up Yours! A Guide to UK Punk, New Wave & Early Post Punk, Borderline Productions, Wolverhampton, p. 136; Despite originating in London, the band made its first public performance on 20 September 1976 at Manchester's Holdsworth Hall, featuring Buzzcocks as their support act. The band did not yet have a permanent bassist and rented a local musician for the show. Lutfi Radwan was soon replaced by drummer Dee Generate (real name: Roger Bullen), and by November 1976, they had recruited bassist Ian Woodcock in time to play their first London gig. Eater became one of the pioneering punk bands that played live in the first few months of the now-legendary Roxy Club. They topped the bill twice in January 1977; the second time they were supported by the Damned. They headlined again in February, this time supported by Johnny Moped, and twice more in March, supported first by the Lurkers and then by Sham 69.Thompson, D. (2000) Punk, Collector’s Guide Publication, Ontario, Canada, p. 61 - 62; They also supplied two of their tracks, \\"15\\" (a version of \\"I'm Eighteen\\" by Alice Cooper) and \\"Don't Need It\\", to the seminal live compilation album The Roxy London WC2, released on 24 June 1977 by Harvest Records. Extracts from their performances at The Roxy were also included in Don Letts' Punk Rock Movie (1978). The band signed to a small London independent label called The Label, which released three initial singles produced by Dave Goodman: \\"Outside View\\" (1 March 1977), \\"Thinkin' of the USA\\" (June 1977) and \\"Lock It Up\\" (October 1977). The latter featured new drummer Phil Rowland, who had replaced Generate in May 1977. Their sole full-length studio album, simply titled The Album, was released on 11 November 1977. Again produced by Goodman, it included sped-up versions of songs by David Bowie (\\"Queen Bitch\\") and the Velvet Underground (\\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Waiting for the Man\\"). \\"All songs on their sole full-length release sound about the same, played with one stiff light-speed beat and a snotty vehemence to each track, adding up to a ridiculous classic\\", said AllMusic critic Fred Beldin in a retrospective review, adding, \\"As fast and clumsy as the material is, there's an undeniable tunefulness at work, particularly in irresistible singalongs like 'No Brains' and 'Room for One', and the sprightly single 'Lock It Up' even attempts some naïve vocal harmonies as they sneer at the upper classes\\". The Label issued the four-song live EP Get Your Yo-Yo's Out, recorded at Dingwalls, on 2 June 1978. Gary Steadman replaced Chevette for their final single, \\"What She Wants She Needs\\", produced by Martin Hayles and Gwyn Mathias and released in December 1978. The band split up in January 1979. Later projects Woodcock joined the Vibrators in July 1979, appearing on their 1980 single \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\". Rowland joined Slaughter & the Dogs, appearing on their 1979 single \\"You're Ready Now\\", and later played with the London Cowboys. Steadman joined Classix Nouveaux in 1979, playing on their 1981 debut Night People. Blade made several attempts to create a solo career during the 1980s, but failed to secure a deal. In 2005, he published a book about his times with Eater and beyond, called The Secret Life of a Teenage Punk Rocker: The Andy Blade Chronicles (Cherry Red Books). Reunions Eater reformed to play the first Holidays in the Sun festival, held in 1996 in Blackpool., and recorded two new songs in 1997 (\\"Going Down\\" and \\"Vegetable Girl\\") for a projected single that was never released. Both tracks later appeared on The Eater Chronicles 1976-2003 compilation, released in 2003 by Anagram Records. They played another reunion show on 14 May 1999 at the Brighton Centre, supporting Fugazi. Eater reformed again in 2006, playing a one-off gig at the 100 Club on 28 September, supported by T. V. Smith of the Adverts, and supporting Buzzcocks on 2 December (the 30th anniversary of their original tour) at The Forum.

TLR3 is a member of the toll-like receptor family of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system.  Function  TLR3 is a member of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This receptor is most abundantly expressed in placenta and pancreas, and is restricted to the dendritic subpopulation of the leukocytes. It recognizes dsRNA associated with viral infection, and induces the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB. Unlike other TLRs, TLR3 uses TRIF as the sole adaptor. IRF3 ultimately induces the production of type I interferons. It may thus play a role in host defense against viruses. TLR3 recognizes double- stranded RNA, a form of genetic information carried by some viruses such as reoviruses. Additionally, an ephemeral form of double-stranded RNA exists as a replicative intermediate during virus replication. Upon recognition, TLR 3 induces the activation of IRF3 to increase production of type I interferons which signal other cells to increase their antiviral defenses. Double-stranded RNA is also recognised by the cytoplasmic receptors RIG-I and MDA-5. TLR3 displays a protective role in mouse models of atherosclerosis, and activation of TLR3 signaling is associated with ischemic preconditioning-induced protection against brain ischemia and attenuation of reactive astrogliosis. Furthermore, TLR3 activation has been shown to promote hair follicle regeneration in skin wound healing. In addition, TLR3 activators show effects on human vascular cells.  Structure  The structure of TLR3 was reported in June 2005 by researchers at The Scripps Research Institute. TLR3 forms a large horseshoe shape that contacts with a neighboring horseshoe, forming a \\"dimer\\" of two horseshoes. Much of the TLR3 protein surface is covered with sugar molecules, making it a glycoprotein, but on one face (including the proposed interface between the two horseshoes), there is a large sugar-free surface. This surface also contains two distinct patches rich in positively charged amino acids, which may be a binding site for negatively charged double- stranded RNA. Despite being a glycoprotein, TLR3 crystallises readily – a prerequisite for structural analysis by x-ray crystallography.

He also served as consul for the year 424.  Career  In 422 he fought an unsuccessful campaign in Hispania to subdue the Vandals. He was sent to support the Suevi or Suebians, enemies of the Vandals, and came with a force of Gothic foederati. However, the campaign was compromised at the very beginning when, according to one source, \\"his haughty and inept exercise of command\\" led to a quarrel between him and the military tribune Bonifacius, a protégé of Empress Galla Placidia. Bonifacius abruptly left the expedition, eventually arriving in Africa, where he began to build up a power base. Castinus continued on to Hispania, where at first he had considerable success against the Vandals in Baetica, managing to put them under a blockade and coming close to forcing them to surrender. Unfortunately at this point the Gothic auxiliaries betrayed him in some unspecified manner, which led to his defeat at the Battle of Tarraco; Castinus was forced to fall back to Tarraco (Tarragona).Stewart Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta (Chicago: University Press, 1968), pp. 172f. The sudden death of the nonentity Emperor Honorius 15 August 423, which followed the death of the more active Constantius III (421) and the exile of Empress Galla Placidia to Constantinople (Spring 423), created a power vacuum \\"if it can be so described\\", observes John Matthews, which \\"was filled, as we should expect, by usurpation.\\"Matthews, Western Aristocracies and Imperial Court AD 364 - 425 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990), p. 379 The Eastern Emperor Theodosius II hesitated to nominate a new emperor of the West; Stewart Oost points out that with Honorius' death, \\"technically and legally he became sole ruler of the whole Roman Empire\\".

Oost follows Ernst Stein's identification of the consul of 424 with the Patrician; see p. 179 n. 35 for the bibliography of the discussion.

His son William Jr. is currently the principal owner and managing partner of the St. Louis Cardinals, while grandson William O. DeWitt III is the Cardinals' president. The senior DeWitt held multiple ownership and upper management positions in the major leagues, including general manager and owner of both the St. Louis Browns and Cincinnati Reds, chairman of the board of the Chicago White Sox, and president of the Detroit Tigers. Early life and career DeWitt grew up in St. Louis. One of his first jobs, in 1916, was selling soda pop at the St. Louis Browns' home field, Sportsman's Park. He began his formal baseball career with the Cardinals as a protégé of Branch Rickey, who moved from the Browns to the Redbirds late in 1916 and would become a legendary executive and member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. As a young man, DeWitt received a law degree from Washington University in St. Louis and became treasurer of the Cardinals. But DeWitt ultimately joined the Browns, the city's underdog American League (AL) team, in November 1936 as minority owner (initially in partnership with majority stockholder Donald Lee Barnes) and general manager. St. Louis Browns =Financial struggles= The Browns were cash-strapped and struggling to survive as the second-ranked team in one of the smallest markets in the big leagues, during The Great Depression. The team had drawn only 80,922 fans during the entire 1935 season. \\"We operated close to the belt. We had to\\", DeWitt told author William B. Mead in the 1978 book Even the Browns: Baseball During World War II.Mead, William B., Even the Browns: Baseball During World War II. Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1978, pp. 57–65 > Once we ran out of cash. Barnes tried to get the board of directors to put > up some money. They said, 'No! That's money down the rat hole.' A lot > wealthy guys, too ... The Browns had a hell of a time because the Cardinals > were so popular and the Browns couldn't do a damned thing. We didn't have > any attendance money to build up the ball club with. Most of the clubs had > players in the minors that were better than some of the ones we had on the > Browns. The Browns' attendance perked up when they were allowed to play more night home games than other AL teams. Meanwhile, Rickey disciple DeWitt managed to use some of his scant resources to strengthen the Browns' farm system and scouting department, signing and developing Vern Stephens, Al Zarilla, and Jack Kramer—all future major league stars. He also attempted to add depth and unearth hidden talent by trading the Browns' few veteran assets, such as pitcher Bobo Newsom, for second-string players or minor leaguers with other organizations. Still, the team was nearly moved to Los Angeles after the season; however, the American League's secret vote on the transfer was scheduled for the week of December 8, and the attack on Pearl Harbor on Sunday, December 7, plunged the U.S. into World War II and saved the Browns for St. Louis for another dozen seasons. =1944 American League pennant= In 1944, under DeWitt's leadership as general manager, the Browns captured their only American League pennant. They won only 89 games (losing 65), but outlasted the Detroit Tigers by a single game. They drew as their World Series opponents their formidable tenants at Sportsman's Park, the Cardinals, who had won 105 games to breeze to their third consecutive National League championship. In the all-St. Louis 1944 World Series, the Browns took the opener and Game 3, but then they dropped the final three games to the Redbirds, who were in the process of winning three World Series titles in a five-year span. Nevertheless, DeWitt was named 1944 Major League Executive of the Year by The Sporting News to recognize his achievement. The Browns' pennant is often downplayed by observers because it occurred during the height of the World War II manpower shortage, when most of the top American League players were in military service. But DeWitt's wartime Browns were one of the more successful teams in the American League, also posting winning campaigns in 1942 and 1945. During their pennant-winning 1944 season, the Browns drew more fans (508,644) than the Cardinals (461,968) for the first time since 1925.Baseball Reference: 1944 MLB Attendance by Team In 1945, they employed Pete Gray, an outfielder who, despite having only one arm, had become a capable minor league player. However, in 1946, the first postwar season, the Browns fell back into the second division and never enjoyed another winning campaign in St. Louis. DeWitt was forced to sell Stephens, Kramer and Zarilla—along with pitcher Ellis Kinder, a future 20-game-winner—to the wealthy Boston Red Sox to keep the team solvent. DeWitt and the Browns also were among the vanguard, albeit only briefly, of MLB teams to break the baseball color line: in , they became the third club to integrate by purchasing the contracts of Hank Thompson and Willard Brown from the Kansas City Monarchs. Thompson made his MLB debut July 17 (only 12 days after Larry Doby of the Cleveland Indians had integrated the American League) and Brown two days later. But the experiment fizzled; the players performed below expectations and encountered resistance from their white St. Louis teammates.Costello, Rory, Willard Brown, Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project They were sent back to the Monarchs late in August after only 41 total hits. DeWitt and his brother Charlie (1900–1967), the Browns' traveling secretary, bought control of the club from majority owner Richard C. Muckerman in February 1949, but the team's struggles on the field and at the box office continued: they lost 101 and 96 games, and drew an average of 259,000 fans a season, in 1949–1950. Finally, the DeWitts sold the Browns to Bill Veeck in June 1951. Bill DeWitt remained in the Browns' front office until Veeck was forced to sell the club; it then moved from St. Louis to become the Baltimore Orioles in 1954. Detroit Tigers DeWitt then served as assistant general manager of the New York Yankees from 1954–1956 and as administrator of the \\"Professional Baseball Fund\\" in the office of the Commissioner of Baseball until September 1959, when he became president and de facto general manager of the Detroit Tigers. =Brief, but impactful, tenure= In his 14 months as the Tigers' president, DeWitt participated in three significant trades with swap-happy Cleveland Indians GM Frank Lane during the 1960 season. *On April 12, he swung one of the most successful deals in Tiger history, obtaining first baseman Norm Cash, a future star, for little-used infielder Steve Demeter. Cash would win the 1961 AL batting title, play 15 years in Detroit, make four American League All-Star teams, and smash 373 home runs as a Tiger. *Then, five days later on April 17, DeWitt traded reigning AL batting champion Harvey Kuenn (who hit .353 in 1959) to the Indians for Rocky Colavito, the reigning 1959 AL home run co-champion (42 homers, tied with Harmon Killebrew), in a one-for-one deal. Colavito played four seasons in Detroit, and continued to hit the long ball, slugging 139 homers (an average of almost 35 per season). Kuenn, meanwhile, spent only one year in Cleveland before being traded to the National League, and never again hit above .308. *Finally, on August 3, DeWitt and Lane completed the only trade of managers in MLB annals, when the Tigers' Jimmy Dykes was dealt for Cleveland's Joe Gordon. But Gordon only lasted the final eight weeks of the 1960 campaign, going 26–31 with the Tigers before his resignation. Cincinnati Reds DeWitt in 1962. =1961 National League pennant= DeWitt, however, moved on himself shortly after the end of the 1960 season, replacing Gabe Paul as GM of the Cincinnati Reds. He made a number of deals for players such as Joey Jay (a disappointment with the Milwaukee Braves who became a 20-game winner in Cincinnati), Don Blasingame, and Gene Freese, and the Reds went on to win the 1961 National League (NL) pennant after winning just 67 games in 1960. Owner Powel Crosley Jr. died suddenly before the start of the 1961 season. By year's end, DeWitt would purchase 100 percent ownership of the Reds from the Crosley estate. The Reds contended for the first five years of DeWitt's six-season tenure. They fell three games short of repeating in 1962 and one game short of the NL pennant in 1964, a season marred by the terminal illness of their 45-year-old manager, Fred Hutchinson, who was suffering from lung cancer. DeWitt's Reds benefited from a productive farm system, with Jim Maloney, Pete Rose, Tony Pérez, Lee May, and Tommy Helms making their debuts through 1966, and Johnny Bench reaching Triple-A in only his second pro season. =Frank Robinson trade= During the 1965 campaign, the Reds led the National League in runs scored (825) and run differential (+121), but finished in fourth place, eight games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers, due to an inability to win close games. Sorely in need of mound help, DeWitt controversially traded future Hall of Fame outfielder Frank Robinson to the Orioles for two pitchers and a minor league outfielder; the outrage over the trade made it difficult for one of the pitchers, former Orioles standout Milt Pappas, to adjust to pitching in Cincinnati. The trade later was made famous in the 1988 movie Bull Durham, where Susan Sarandon's character says, \\"Bad trades are a part of baseball; I mean who can forget Frank Robinson for Milt Pappas, for God's sake?\\") After announcing the trade, DeWitt famously defended the trade by calling Robinson \\"not a young 30.\\" In his first season with the Orioles, Robinson won the Triple Crown, was unanimously voted the American League Most Valuable Player, and led the Orioles to their first World Series title. Pappas, not yet 27 when the Robinson trade was made, won 28 games in his first two seasons in Cincinnati before being traded to the Atlanta Braves after beginning the 1968 season 2–5. Among the players coming to Cincinnati in that trade would be future bullpen ace Clay Carroll. Another player involved in the Robinson deal was Dick Simpson, a physical specimen and minor league standout who was both fast and powerful, but could not hit major league pitching. The Robinson deal somewhat clouded DeWitt's Cincinnati legacy, although many of the players he had signed or developed became key members of the team's \\"Big Red Machine\\" dynasty of the 1970s. He sold the Reds to a syndicate led by Cincinnati newspaper publisher Francis L. Dale (and including William DeWitt Jr.) in December 1966. One month later, DeWitt was succeeded by Bob Howsam as general manager. Late career In 1967, DeWitt's name was briefly linked with an ownership group that unsuccessfully sought an expansion team for Buffalo, New York, as both leagues announced plans to grow from 10 to 12 teams in .Holtzman, Jerome, \\"A.L. Vote to Expand Marks 1967 History.\\" The Sporting News Official 1968 Baseball Guide, page 181 DeWitt's last official post in baseball was as chairman and minority owner of the Chicago White Sox from 1975 to 1981, working with the flamboyant Veeck once again. DeWitt died in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 4, 1982, at age 79.

Historical evidence about Saint Simon's life comes primarily from medieval catalogues of saints and of Carmelite priors general, which are not consistent with one another in their details. The earliest of these describe Saint Simon as someone known for holiness during his life, and miracles attested to this after his death. He is said to have died in Bordeaux on May 16, though the year is not documented. The surname \\"Stock\\" appears in some documents but not in others, and is related to a story that the Saint lived for a time in a hollow tree (\\"stock\\" meant tree trunk) before the arrival of the Carmelites in England, in keeping with prophetic tradition. He is believed to have lived at Aylesford in Kent, a place that hosted in 1247 the first general chapter of the Carmelite Order held outside the Holy Land, and where there is still a monastery of Carmelite friars.The Friars, Aylesford Priory website (Carmelites of the Ancient Observance) \\"A Brief History of the Friars\\", Friars website from Aylesford Priory Saint Simon was probably the fifth or sixth prior general of the Carmelites (historical evidence suggests perhaps from about 1256-1266). During his service, the order spread widely in southern and western Europe, especially in England. Stock is credited with founding houses in the university cities of that era, as in 1248 at Cambridge, in 1253 at Oxford, in 1260 at Paris and Bologna. This action was important for both the growth of the institution and for the training of its younger members. Stock lived an ascetic life. He lived on a diet of herbs, roots and wild apples and drank only water.Butler, Alban. (1846). The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints. Derby. p. 257Roberts, Holly. (2004). Vegetarian Christian Saints. Anjeli Press. p. 96. \\"He spent his time in prayer and solitary contemplation, preferring to live under harsh conditions, drinking only water, and never consuming any foods that were not vegetarian. He sustained himself on herbs, roots, and wild apples.\\" He died in Bordeaux, France, where he was buried.Bede Edwards, OCDS. \\"St. Simon Stock--The Scapular Vision & the Brown Scapular Devotion.\\" Carmel Clarion Volume XXI, pp 17-22, July–August 2005, Discalced Carmelite Secular Order, Washington Province. The earliest extant liturgical office in Saint Simon Stock's honour was composed in Bordeaux in France, and dates from 1435. Liturgies are first known to have been celebrated in Ireland and England in 1458, and throughout the Carmelite Order in 1564. His feast day, an optional memorial, is May 16. The Saint's bones are still preserved in a cathedral in Bordeaux; a tibia was brought to England in the 1860s for the Carmelite church in Kensington, a part of the skull was enshrined at Aylesford in 1950. Saint Simon Stock is the patron saint of the English province of Discalced Carmelites. Brown Scapular Chiesa del Carmine, Milan. Simon Stock and an angel. The earliest accounts of Saint Simon's life do not mention him having a vision. The first such reference dates from the late 14th century, over 100 years after the July 16, 1251 date when tradition says the vision occurred. It states that \\"St. Simon was an Englishman, a man of great holiness and devotion, who always in his prayers asked the Virgin to favour his Order with some singular privilege. The Virgin appeared to him holding the Scapular in her hand.Eamon R. Carroll, O.Carm; Medieval Devotion to Mary Among the Carmelites In its original context, the meaning of this promise was that Carmelite religious who persevered in their vocation would be saved. Beginning in the 16th century, the Carmelites began giving the Brown Scapular to lay people who wanted to be affiliated with the Order, and it became increasingly popular as a religious article.Andrew Jotischky; The Carmelites and Antiquity. Mendicants and their Pasts in the Middle Ages. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002. Scholarly investigation into historical source documents has raised questions about whether Saint Simon Stock's vision actually happened, or if this tradition about him arose later, perhaps as a means of expressing in the form of a story, the strongly held Carmelite spiritual belief in the favor and protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Several other religious orders in the Middle Ages had similar stories of Mary giving their habit or promising protection.Fr. Kieran Kavanaugh, OCD, Zenit News Service. Brown Scapular: A Silent Devotion July 16, 2008. The great Carmelite authors of the 14th century do not mention the scapular at all. Challenges to the historicity of the scapular vision (and passionate defenses of it) are not a new phenomenon; a notable challenge came in 1653, from a scholar at the University of Paris, Fr. Jean de Launoy. In response, a Carmelite named Fr. John Cheron published a fragment of a letter Carmel, Its History, Spirit, and Saints. New York: P.J. Kennedy & Sons, 1927. pp 218-226. The Brown Scapular -- Book excerpt found at the web link contains extensive quotes from the 17th century forged letter purportedly written in the 13th century by Saint Simon Stock's secretary \\"Peter Swanington\\". Many older sources surprisingly accepted the Swanington letter without question. which he purported to be an account by Saint Simon Stock's secretary Peter Swanington (or Swanyngton), giving details of the Saint's life, and the scapular vision.Herbert Thurston, S.J., \\"The Origin of the Scapular -- A Criticism.\\" The Irish Ecclesiastical Record Vol XVI July–December 1904. pp. 59-75. Dublin: Browne & Nolan, Limited. -- well researched 1904 journal article demonstrates the falsity of the Swanington letter as well as the forged papal bull that was the basis of the \\"Sabbatine privilege\\", discusses Carmelite history and the facts about the evolution of the scapular devotion etc. This document was also the origin of the date that has become traditional for the vision, July 16, 1251 (July 16 was already in the 17th century the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, though that liturgy made no reference to the scapular). Today, scholars affirm that this document was a forgery and Fr. Cheron himself the likely author.Fr. Paul D'Souza, OCD. The Carmelite Scapular: History and Devotion Shortly after Vatican II, the historical uncertainties revealed by 20th-century scholars such as Fr. Ludovico Saggi, O.Carm of the \\"Institutum Carmelitanum\\" in Rome, resulted in the Church briefly striking the feast day of Saint Simon Stock from the Carmelite liturgical calendar. It was restored in 1979 as an optional memorial, on the condition that no mention be made of the scapular vision. Devotion to the Brown Scapular remains widespread and recommended by the Catholic Church. The Carmelites continue to find meaning in the traditional story and iconography of Saint Simon Stock receiving the scapular, particularly as reflecting their filial relationship with Mary. When Pope John Paul II addressed the Carmelite family in 2001 on the occasion of the 750th anniversary of the bestowal of the Scapular, he said that > \\"Over time this rich Marian heritage of Carmel has become, through the > spread of the Holy Scapular devotion, a treasure for the whole Church. By > its simplicity, its anthropological value and its relationship to Mary's > role in regard to the Church and humanity, this devotion was so deeply and > widely accepted by the People of God that it came to be expressed in the > memorial of 16 July on the liturgical calendar of the universal Church,\\" the > Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.Pope John Paul II Message to the Carmelite > Family March 25, 2001 See also *Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel *Carmelites *Book of the First Monks *Constitutions of the Carmelite Order *Carmelite Rite *Hermit *St Simon Stock Catholic School *Cincture of the Theotokos relic associated with St. Thomas in the Eastern Orthodox Church Notes  External links  *Butler's Lives of the Saints: St. Simon Stock Category:Carmelites Category:Venerated Carmelites Category:Medieval Kent Category:People from Kent Category:Marian visionaries Category:Our Lady of Mount Carmel Category:13th- century Christian saints Category:Medieval English saints Category:1265 deaths Category:English Roman Catholic saints Category:English saints Category:Year of birth unknown Category:English hermits Category:13th-century English people ","title":"Simon Stock"},{"id":"2082145","text":"Lux is a series of turn-based strategy computer games, inspired by the rule system of the board game Risk but expanding it to function on any map made up of a graph of countries and the connections between them. Lux was developed and self-published by developer Sillysoft Games. The user community has been active in growing Lux. Users can create maps and computer AIs for Lux, and submit them to be included in the official plugin manager.Inside Mac Games Review: Lux Gameplay Lux Delux is a Risk-style clone with generally similar rules to the original. Up to six players can play at once, and any empty spot in the game is filled up by \\"bots,\\" or computer AI personalities.http://sillysoft.net/lux/ Lux has over 900 maps, each varying in size, shape, and complexity.http://sillysoft.net/lux/maps/pictures_all.php Regardless of the map, the object of the game remains: eliminate all other players so only one remains. Players play for \\"Raw,\\" which is awarded or taken away based on whether you win or lose games. These games are recorded, and the player with the most raw at the end of the week is awarded a virtual medal.http://sillysoft.net/lux/rankings/http://sillysoft.net/lux/rankings/awards/ Aside from the weekly medals, players compete for the best seed, the calculation of a player's best weekly ranking.http://sillysoft.net/lux/rankings/seeds/ Awards are distributed on a player's rankings page, along with a record of his/her win percentage, games, and more. Like Risk, winning in Lux requires both skill and luck, with every attack hanging on the result of a dice roll. However, in spite of the randomness there exists a regular group of players who dominate the multiplayer rankings. Like many online turn-based board games, Lux includes a chat capability, allowing conversation, tactical discussions, offers of alliance, etc., and some players use this as a political tool in their play to great advantage. The ranking system is very competitive, and has evolved into a two-tiered system where each player has a score in the current week, as well as a seeded place depending on the last 16 weeks of play. The online player base is relatively small (about 700 regular online players), but many of them are fairly dedicated. =AI opponents= A much greater number of users play the game off-line with computer AI opponents. The AI players play by the same rules and are subject to the same game-play limitations as human players, that is, they can't cheat. About half of these \\"bots\\" were programmed by members of the community, and they have evolved to employ sophisticated strategies, such as recognizing players who target them, cooperation, and the imitation of other bots' behavior. Some also respond to text chat, and human responses to them can influence their choice of tactics. The bots sometimes receive respectable rankings for their online play. =Maps= The original maps are numerous and varied, and most of them are made and submitted by players and casual gamers. Some maps are based on historic battles or wars (e.g., there is a map of the Vietnam War), and others are fantasy realms, inspired by other board games (such as \\"Monopoluxy,\\" or \\"Scrabblux\\"), or are simply geometric shapes. In addition, the coding allows for one-way connections on a map, meaning a particular \\"country\\" may be able to attack another, but not the other way around, which allows for unique strategies. In addition to specific maps, there are also map generators, which give you a random set of countries and continents as opposed to a set map. =Starting scenarios= Maps feature what is called a starting scenario. When this option is on, players get a set number of troops and income in a location predetermined by the map's creator. Community Lux has a small community, with a few hundred players playing online at any given time, and an unknown number playing offline with bots. Currently, this community is moderated by six \\"mods,\\" and the owner, Dustin. There are very few rules which players have to follow, most of which are along the lines of \\"Keep your language appropriate for a friendly board game.\\"http://sillysoft.net/lux/rules.php =Forums= Sillysoft hosts a Lux Delux forum, where old and new players can get a jump on special tournaments, and other Lux-related news.

It is home to many wineries and vineyards, as well as the city of Cloverdale. It is the largest and most fully planted wine region in Sonoma.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 643 Oxford University Press 2006 Highway 101 runs through the valley, and the Russian River flows down the valley, surrounded by vineyards on both sides. From the higher elevations of the valley rim, there is a view as far south as Taylor Mountain and Sonoma Mountain. The region was named for Cyrus Alexander, owner of a part of the Rancho Sotoyome Mexican land grant, in 1847. Granted AVA status in 1984, the boundaries of the appellation are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 27, Section 9.53. History A Cabernet Sauvignon from the Alexander Valley AVA In its early history, the territory commonly referred to as the \\"Alexander Valley\\" denoted the benchlands east of the Russian River leading up to the Mayacamas Mountains. The area west of the Russian River was known as “the plaines” or “the ranchos.” Prior to Spanish colonization, Alexander Valley was occupied by the Wappo and Pomo. Viticulture in the area dates back to 1843, when Cyrus Alexander used vine cuttings collected from Fort Ross on the Pacific coast, to establish vineyards in the area. For most of its history the region was predominately associated with mass-produced bulk and jug wines made from indiscriminately planted field blends of red grape varieties. A modern era of quality wine production began in the late 1960s when a new owner of Simi Winery sought to revive the area's long winemaking history. In the 1970s, a new wave of producers, such as Chateau Souverain and Jordan Vineyard & Winery, descended upon the area and started making wines that received critical and consumer acclaim. Wine pioneer, Rodney Strong, whose namesake winery is located in Russian River Valley, was also among the first to recognize Alexander Valley's potential, producing and releasing Sonoma County's first single vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon from the 1974 vintage. The vineyard designated was Strong's Alexander's Crown vineyard located near Jimtown. In 1988, E & J Gallo Winery purchased substantial tracts of land in the Alexander Valley to establish the fine wine brand of the company. In 1963, one of Alexander Valley's most prestigious vineyards, the Robert Young Vineyard, was planted. There were few wineries in the area at the time so the vineyard sourced most of it fruit to wineries outside the valley. One of these wineries, Chateau St. Jean, was so impressed with the quality of fruit that with the 1975 vintage of their Chardonnay they put the name of the vineyard on the wine label. This \\"vineyard designated wine\\" would be one of the first premium wines in California wine history to have the name of the vineyard appear on the label. =Expansion= Located in the northeastern section of Sonoma County, the original boundaries of the AVA extend from the banks of the Russian River eastward to the foothills of the Mayacamas Mountains. In 1986 these boundaries were expanded to include overlapping regions of the Russian River AVA. A second expansion occurred in 1990 to cover vineyards owned by Sir Peter Michael and Ellis Alden in the foothills east of Geyserville. In 2001, the area consisting of the Gill Creek watershed was changed from being part of the Dry Creek AVA to a reclassification as part of the Alexander Valley AVA.T. Stevenson, ed. The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (4th Edition) pg 482 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Geography and climate Location of the Alexander Valley AVA in relation to the Russian River path through Sonoma County The Alexander Valley covers a broad expanse of land east of the Russian River consisting of the watershed that runs southeast from the Mendocino County line down to the boundaries of the Chalk Hill AVA. The area is sheltered from the influence of the nearby Pacific Oceans by the low-lying hills northeast of Healdsburg. The dominant vineyard soil of the region is alluvial.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 274 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 During the day, the Alexander Valley is one of the warmest areas in Northern California but at night experiences a wide diurnal temperature variation that offers cool climate conditions. The region's proximity to the Russian River serves a source for early morning fog that covers the lower vineyard areas until it burned off by the morning sun. Wines Cabernet Sauvignon from the Alexander Valley A characteristic associated with Alexander Valley wines is a rich, fleshy mouthfeel and a degree of voluptuousness due to the area's generally warm climate and ability to sufficiently ripen the grapes. While the wine exhibit a degree of drinkability and accessibility in their youth, they may not have the same aging potential as wines from Napa Valley or even other areas of Sonoma County. The Alexander Valley is capable of growing a wide range of grape varieties but in recent years, the area has been noted for the quality of its Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The alluvial soils of the region tend to impart a rich, chocolate note to the Cabernet. Other Alexander Valley varietals that have been gaining recognition include Chardonnay, Nebbiolo and Sangiovese. The Chardonnay from this region is characterized by its rich, tropical fruits. Some experts, such as Jancis Robinson, have speculated that Zinfandel and Sauvignon blanc may eventually prove themselves to be best suited to the climate and soils of the Alexander Valley. River Rock Casino controversy In the early 21st century, controversy erupted in the Alexander Valley when the Alexander Valley Association of farmers, wineries and property owners objected to a proposed tribal casino to be built on land owned by the Pomo people. In 1998, the association had been able to block a large winery expansion proposed by Kendall-Jackson, but in the dispute with the Pomo casino, federal and state laws granted the tribe the right to develop the land in any way they wished. The casino was built and named River Rock Casino. Resulting traffic problems along Highway 128 following River Rock Casino's 2002 opening have led to public safety concerns during harvest season when the narrow rural roadways must accommodate tractor trailers and grape gondolas.T. Fish \\"Gambling Rolls into Sonoma Wine Country \\" Wine Spectator, July 23, 2003 These concerns intensified after River Rock received their liquor license in 2008.

In American folklore, the snallygaster is a bird-reptile chimera originating in the superstitions of early German immigrants later combined with sensationalistic newspaper reports of the monster. Early sightings associate the snallygaster with Frederick County, Maryland, especially the areas of South Mountain and the Middletown Valley. Later reports would expand on sightings encompassing an area to include Central Maryland and the Washington, DC, metro area. History =18th century= The area was settled by German immigrants beginning in the 1730s. Early accounts describe the community being terrorized by a monster called a Schneller Geist, meaning \\"quick ghost\\" in German. The earliest incarnations mixed the half-bird features of a siren with the nightmarish features of demons and ghouls. The snallygaster was described as half-reptile, half-bird with a metallic beak lined with razor-sharp teeth, occasionally with octopus-like tentacles. It swoops silently from the sky to pick up and carry off its victims. The earliest stories claim that this monster sucked the blood of its victims. Seven-pointed stars, which reputedly kept the snallygaster at bay, can still be seen painted on local barns. =19th century= It has been suggested the legend was resurrected in the 19th century to frighten freed slaves. =20th century= Theodore Roosevelt (here, as Badlands hunter in 1885) proposed to hunt the snallygaster Newspaper accounts throughout February and March 1909 describe encounters between local residents and a beast with \\"enormous wings, a long pointed bill, claws like steel hooks, and an eye in the center of its forehead.\\" It was described as making screeches \\"like a locomotive whistle.\\"The Valley Register, February 12—March 5, 1909. A great deal of publicity surrounded this string of appearances, with the Smithsonian Institution offering a reward for the hide. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt reportedly considered postponing an African safari to personally hunt the beast. . It was later revealed that these reports were part of a hoax perpetrated by Middletown Valley Register editor George C. Rhoderick and reporter Ralph S. Wolfe in an attempt to increase readership. The descriptions they invented borrowed themes from existing German folklore, including dragon- like creatures who snatched children and livestock, and also appeared to invoke descriptions of the Jersey Devil, which had been spotted mere weeks earlier. Maryland-based writer Whittaker Chambers used the snallygaster to examine U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy (1953) (pictured) On June 22, 1953, Whittaker Chambers (whose home lies in Carroll County, Maryland) used the snallygaster to examine U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy in his essay \\"Is Academic Freedom in Danger?\\" (Life ): > It was a trick of fate in a low comedy mood that Senator McCarthy should > first have bounded into public view dragging the unlikely and protesting > person of Mr. Lattimore to share with him a historic spotlight so grateful > to the one and so acutely unwanted by the other.

It is described as a part-bird, part-reptile relative of the Occamy, with serrated steel fangs and a bulletproof hide, and has gained some Muggle attention due to its natural curiosity.

The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating . This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . The Halifax class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers. =Armament and aircraft= As built the Halifax-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a \\"bear trap\\" system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The Halifax class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar. As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface-to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for \\"last- ditch\\" defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow. As built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute to a range of more than . =Countermeasures and sensors= As built, the decoy system comprises two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship's radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada. Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the bridge-top and one on a raised platform on the forward end of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating in C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating in G and H bands, and a Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503. =Modernization= The Halifax class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates' capabilities in combatting modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main FELEX program. The FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire control radars were replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 fire control radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall's Multi-Ammunition Soft kill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard and the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx CIWS was upgraded to Block 1B and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile. Operational history HMCS Calgary pulls into Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, to support Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2010 exercises. Calgary was laid down on 15 June 1991 by MIL Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon and launched on 28 August 1992. She was commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 12 May 1995 and carries the hull classification symbol 335. On 10 July 1995, Calgary was sent to the Persian Gulf as part of the force used to enforce sanctions on Iraq, her mission lasting until December of that year.Tracy, p. 204 While en route home, she assisted the sinking bulk carrier Mount Olympus. She rescued all 30 members of the crew, taking them to the freighter Rodopi. Calgary deployed as part of the NATO blockade of Yugoslavia in the Adriatic Sea.Tracy, p. 226 HMCS Calgary deployed on Exercise \\"Tandem Thrust\\" in 1999. In 1999, while participating in the naval exercise \\"Tandem Thrust\\", Calgary suffered the breakdown of one of her diesel generators. The following year the frigate redeployed to the Persian Gulf, once again as part of the group enforcing sanctions against Iraq, replacing sister ship .Tracy, p. 262 Calgary sailed to the Persian Gulf in 2003 as part of Operation Apollo. During her time in theatre, the ship conducted 24 boardings of suspect vessels. Calgary was the last ship to deploy as part of the operation, which ended with the ship's departure on 1 November 2003.Milner, p. 320 In 2008, with the auxiliary vessel and the destroyer , Calgary sailed to the Horn of Africa to join the Combined Task Force 150. Calgary spent her time performing maritime interdiction of people and drug smuggling and stopping piracy between Somalia and Yemen.Tracy, pp. 277, 279 In 2009, Calgary sailed to the Caribbean Sea to take part in Operation Caribbe, the Canadian drug-interdiction operation.Tracy, p. 285 On 6 June 2011 Calgary was turned over to Seaspan Marine Corporation's Victoria Shipyards, to start an 18-month mid-life upgrading and modernization. Calgary was returned to the Royal Canadian Navy from Victoria Shipyards on 1 June 2012 and as of fall 2013 conducted sea acceptance trials. Calgary participated in RIMPAC 2014 in June 2014, the first time that China will participate in the operation. Calgary, accompanied by , and , departed in October 2014 to take part in San Francisco Fleet Week and the Task Group Exercise (TGEX) with the US Navy in American coastal waters. In October 2015, Calgary, along with and , participated in the TGEX naval exercise. In June 2016, Calgary, Vancouver, and Yellowknife sailed from Esquimalt to participate in the RIMPAC naval exercise. On 25 February 2018, of fuel was spilled from the ship while Calgary was sailing in the Georgia Strait between Vancouver Island and the mainland. Calgary circled back on her path and aircraft searched along the course for an oil sheen. The Western Canadian Marine Response was alerted and the Canadian Coast Guard and Environment Canada were also responded to the situation. The Royal Canadian Navy deployed four of its s and one CP-140A Aurora aircraft to search for signs of oil spill, but found none. Environment Canada believed this was due to inclement weather which prevented the oil from reaching shore and caused it to break up in the ocean. On 30 July, Calgary departed Esquimalt for a five-month deployment to the Pacific Ocean taking part in naval exercises with Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia. The ship was joined by the Canadian auxiliary ship in the Western Pacific, visiting Da Nang, Vietnam in September. Calgary was deployed in naval exercises in the South China Sea, East China Sea, visiting Japan and Australia. Calgary was assigned duties enforcing United Nations resolutions against North Korea. After a year at sea, Asterix and Calgary returned to Canada at CFB Esquimalt on 18 December.

It was released on February 4, 1974, by RCA Victor. The title track, \\"Jolene\\", tells the tale of a housewife confronting a beautiful seductress who she believes is having an affair with her husband. It became Parton's second solo number-one country single; it also was a moderate pop hit for her, and also did well in the United Kingdom. Since the introduction of downloads to the Official Chart in 2005, it has amassed 255,300 downloads and 6.68 million streams. It has been covered by numerous performers. The album was released around the time Parton was embarking on a solo career, after having spent seven years as part of Porter Wagoner's weekly TV series and road show, and one of the album's songs, \\"I Will Always Love You\\", was reportedly written to express the remorse Parton felt over the professional breakup. Released as the album's second single, it also became a number-one country single. \\"Early Morning Breeze\\" is a re- recording of a song which previously appeared on 1971's Coat of Many Colors. \\"Lonely Coming Down\\" had first appeared on Parton's Wagoner tribute album, My Favorite Songwriter, Porter Wagoner, from 1972. Another re-issue was released in conjunction with Dolly's 2007 European Tour along with two other older out- of-print albums. This re-issue included additional previously unreleased songs. In 2010, Sony Music reissued the 2007 CD Jolene in a triple-feature CD set with Coat of Many Colors and My Tennessee Mountain Home and they have never been out of print.

Montréal is the seventh ship in her class which is based on the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project. She is the second vessel to carry the designation . She is assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and is homeported at CFB Halifax. Montréal serves on MARLANT missions protecting Canada's sovereignty in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and enforcing Canadian laws in its territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone. The ship has also been deployed on missions throughout the Atlantic and to the Indian Ocean; specifically the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea on anti-terrorism operations.

Service history Montréal was laid down on 8 February 1991 by Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd. at Saint John and launched on 28 February 1992. She was commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 21 July 1994 by Francine St-Pierre and carries the hull classification symbol FFH 336. In January 1995 Montréal joined the NATO mission in the Adriatic Sea enforcing the United Nations blockade of Yugoslavia.Tracy, p. 225 Twice she acted as the flagship of the force before returning to Canada on 19 July 2005. In 1997 as part of an experiment to reduce noise, the warship had 12,500 anechoic tiles added to her hull. The experiment was not successful. As part of a NATO fleet in 1998, Montréal sailed to Saint Petersburg, Russia as part of celebrations of the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy. The frigate represented Canada in the Millennium International Fleet Review in New York City. In July 2000, the American merchant ship GTS Katie refused to bring its Canadian military cargo into port, claiming unpaid fees. On 30 July, the Canadian Forces sent the destroyer to maintain contact with the rogue ship and deployed Montréal the following day. As part of Operation Megaphone, a detachment of personnel was sent over by CH-124 Sea King to board Katie. The crew of the merchant ship offered no resistance and the ship was escorted into port. The captain of the ship later claimed that the ship had been attacked and the boarding had been \\"dangerous\\". The Canadian Defence Minister later rebuffed those charges, claiming the boarding had been necessary. In 2002, Montréal sailed to take part in Operation Apollo, Canada's naval contribution to the War in Afghanistan. Arriving on 9 September the frigate remained in theatre until 25 April 2003. The warship had remained longer than usual in theatre due to a crash of a CH-124 Sea King aboard her replacement, the destroyer . In 2004, the frigate sailed to the Arctic, becoming the first major Canadian warship to visit the region since 1982.Tracy, p. 293 In January 2005, Montréal deployed as part of a NATO rapid reaction force. On 8 February 2005 a crewmember was lost overboard and subsequently pronounced dead. The warship participated in Operation Nanook in 2010. In 2010 Montréal engaged in acceptance trials for the new CH-148 Cyclone maritime helicopter. Several modifications had to be made for the trials to the ship, including adding night-vision friendly green filters to the flight deck landing lights and reinforcing the flight deck due to the Cyclone being heavier than the CH-124 Sea King. Montréal successfully completed the tests which included routine flying operations as well as responding to some critical situations. Montréal with in 2011 On 3 July 2011, as part of their national Canadian tour, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge embarked on the vessel which conveyed them from Montréal to Quebec City. In August, Montréal sailed up the St. Lawrence Seaway into Lake Ontario as part of Great Lakes Deployment 11 where she visited multiple cities including Toronto, Hamilton, Montréal, and Trois-Rivières. On 5 July 2012, Montréal was turned over to Irving Shipbuilding's Halifax Shipyards, to start an 18-month mid-life upgrading and modernization (HCM/FELEX). Montréal re-joined the fleet after completing the Halifax Class Modernization refit on 26 September 2013. Subsequently, Montréal conducted sea trials for her new combat and weapons systems. Montréal achieved Restricted Readiness on 9 May 2014. After further Sea Acceptance Trials and Work Ups, Montréal assumed Normal Readiness on 9 March 2015, being the fifth post-refit frigate to achieve this milestone. Trois-Rivières port, Mauricie, May 2017. The crew of HMCS Montréal were deployed to participate in flood relief efforts. In late 2015, Montréal deployed for a large NATO naval exercise, Joint Warrior. On completion of this exercise, Montréal participated in \\"At Sea Demonstration 2015\\" (ASD 2015), a multinational exercise that took place off the Hebrides Islands of Scotland in October 2015. The exercise was conducted under the Maritime Theater Missile Defence Forum (MTMD), an international group that aims to improve maritime integrated air and missile defence capabilities within a coalition context. While on exercise during a port visit in Faslane, Scotland, Montréal hosted an official royal visit by Prince Charles who was recently appointed as Commodore in Chief of the Royal Canadian Navy's Atlantic Fleet. Montréal returned to Halifax on 27 November 2015. The ship participated in further sea trials with the CH-148 Cyclone helicopters off the coast of Nova Scotia in March 2016. In April it was announced that Montréal and sister ship would be the test ships for the Royal Canadian Navy's planned reduced crew size trials. On 24 October 2016, Montréal began her first deployment after conversion to an experimental ship. In May 2017, 120 of the crew were deployed in the Mauricie region of Quebec to participate in flood relief efforts. In August 2017, Montréal and the s and departed Halifax to take part in the Operation Nanook in Canada's northern waters.

Life Julius Röntgen was born in Leipzig, Germany, to a family of musicians. His father, the Dutch born Engelbert Röntgen, was first violinist in the Gewandhaus orchestra in Leipzig; his mother, Pauline Klengel, was a pianist, an aunt of the renowned cellist Julius Klengel, born in 1859. Julius was a gifted child. Neither he nor his sisters attended school; he was taught music by his parents and grandparents, and other subjects by private tutors. His first piano teacher was Carl Reinecke, the director of the Gewandhaus orchestra, while his early compositions were influenced by Reinecke, but also by Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms. Engelbert Röntgen, father of composer, in 1870 In 1870, at the age of 14, Julius Röntgen visited Franz Liszt in Weimar; after playing piano for him he was invited to a soiree at Liszt's house. In Leipzig, he and his parents were part of the musical circle around Heinrich von Herzogenberg, and it was at their house that he first met Brahms. Later Röntgen moved to Munich, where he studied piano under Franz Lachner, a friend of Franz Schubert. At the age of 18 he became a professional pianist. During a concert tour through southern Germany he became acquainted with the singer Julius Stockhausen; at this time he also met a Swedish music student Amanda Maier, whom he would marry in 1880. In 1877 Röntgen had to make a decision whether to go to Vienna or Amsterdam. He chose Amsterdam, and became a piano teacher in the music school there. The aristocratic politician Alexander de Savornin Lohman, who was professor of law at the University of Amsterdam and an important figure in the cultural life of that city, was a friend of Röntgen's father, and he promised to take young Julius under his wing. According to Röntgen's letter of 1877 he considered the school \\"a place full of children and amateurs\\"; since the school was not supported by public funds, it appeared to attach more importance to the number of its students rather than their quality. Between 1878 and 1885 Brahms was a frequent visitor in Amsterdam. In 1887 Röntgen performed Brahms's second piano concerto, conducted by the composer himself. Röntgen also played an important part in establishing institutions for classical music in Amsterdam. In 1883, in association with composers Frans Coenen and Daniel de Lange, Röntgen founded the Amsterdam Conservatory. In 1884 Röntgen was heavily involved in the foundation of the Concertgebouw. He applied for the position of the director; however, to his great disappointment, the choice fell instead on the German Hans von Bülow, as the committee seemed to doubt Röntgen's abilities as a conductor. Nevertheless, Bülow was not able to accept the appointment, and the position went in the end to the violinist Willem Kes. Röntgen turned with greater energy to composing chamber music and to his work for the Conservatory. He became a renowned accompanying pianist, working for the great violinist Carl Flesch, the singer Johannes Messchaert, and the cello player Pablo Casals. Travelling with Messchaert he came to Vienna at least once a year, where he would always meet Brahms. Röntgen in 1918 During the quiet summer periods in Amsterdam, Röntgen and his family often went to Denmark. On one of such visit he met Bodil de Neergaard, with whom he struck up a close friendship. As a result of his close contacts with Denmark, Röntgen's children became fluent speakers of Danish. For some years, Röntgen and his sons performed together as a piano trio. After the death of his wife Amanda in 1894, Röntgen married the gifted piano teacher Abrahamina des Amorie van der Hoeven. The children of the second marriage also became professional musicians. Röntgen's son Joachim, a violinist, founded the Röntgen String Quartet. At the end of the First World War, in 1919, Röntgen became a naturalized Dutch citizen. One of his sons was taken prisoner by the Germans during the war, while another son emigrated to the United States where he became a soldier in the US army. As a result, Röntgen was for many years unable to visit his native Germany. In the years from 1920 on Röntgen experimented with atonal music; he wrote e.g. a bi-tonal symphony in 1930.Donemus, p. 26. Sometimes he performed as a piano accompanist in silent screen productions with popular and folk scenes of the film-maker Dirk van der Ven in the Tuschinski cinema theatre in Amsterdam. He had already published these popular and folk tunes in an earlier stage of his life. He also made many recordings on player piano rolls for the pianola. Röntgen (right), with Edvard Grieg (left of picture) Percy Grainger, and Nina Grieg, at \\"Troldhaugen\\", July 1907.In 1924 Röntgen retired from public life. He moved to Bilthoven, a small village near Utrecht. His son Frants, who followed a career in architecture, designed for him the country house Gaudeamus. The unusual round music room in that house was constructed in such a way that its floor did not touch the ground, but hung from the ceiling. During the last eight years of his life Röntgen wrote about 100 compositions, mostly chamber music and songs. Gaudeamus became a meeting place for many important composers and musicians; among the visitors in that house were Pablo Casals and Percy Grainger. At that time, Röntgen studied musical analysis and was interested in the work of Hindemith, Stravinsky, Schönberg, and Willem Pijper. In 1930 Röntgen received an honorary doctorate from the University of Edinburgh, where his friend Donald Francis Tovey was professor. During this visit Tovey performed a new Röntgen symphony with the Reid Orchestra and Röntgen was the soloist in his most recent two piano concertos in the same programme. Two years after Röntgen's death, Tovey described him as \\"one of the greatest masters of absolute music I have ever known\\".Donald Francis Tovey, Musical Form and Matter. The Philip Maurice Deneke Lecture delivered at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford on the 4th June 1934 (Oxford University Press, 1934), p. 36. After Second World War the villa Gaudeamus became the seat of the Gaudeamus society, whose aim is to promote contemporary Dutch music. Röntgen died in a hospital in Utrecht, Netherlands on 14 September 1932.

Fredericton is the eighth ship in her class which is based on the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project. She is the second vessel to carry the name. Fredericton serves on MARLANT missions protecting Canada's sovereignty in the Atlantic Ocean and enforcing Canadian laws in its territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone. Fredericton has also been deployed on missions throughout the Atlantic and to the Indian Ocean; specifically the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea on anti-terrorism operations. Fredericton has also participated in several NATO missions, patrolling the Atlantic Ocean as part of Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) and its successor Standing NATO Response Force Maritime Group 1 (SNMG1). The frigate is assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and is homeported at CFB Halifax. As of 4 July 2018 Fredericton has been commanded by Commander Blair Brown. Description and design The Halifax-class frigate design, emerging from the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project, was ordered by the Canadian Forces in 1977 as a replacement for the aging , , , and es of destroyer escorts, which were all tasked with anti-submarine warfare.Milner, p. 284 Fredericton was ordered in December 1987 as part of the second batch of frigates.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 291Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 47 To reflect the changing long term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the Halifax-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities. As built, the Halifax-class vessels displaced and were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of .Saunders, p. 90 That made them slightly larger than the Iroquois-class destroyers. The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating . This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . The Halifax class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers. =Armament and aircraft= As built the Halifax-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a \\"bear trap\\" system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The Halifax class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar. As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface-to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for \\"last- ditch\\" defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow. As built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than . The vessels also carry eight machine guns. =Countermeasures and sensors= As built, the decoy system comprises Two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship's radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada. Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503. =Modernization= The Halifax class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates' capabilities in combatting modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program. The FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire control radars were replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 re-control radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall's Multi- Ammunition Soft kill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard and the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile. Operational history Frederictons keel was laid down on 25 April 1992 at Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd. at Saint John, New Brunswick and the frigate was launched on 26 June 1993. Fredericton was commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 10 September 1994 at Fredericton and carries the hull classification symbol FFH 337.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 292 From February to April 1995, the frigate sailed to the Persian Gulf to take part in sanctions enforcement against Iraq that were instituted following the end of the Gulf War.Tracy, p. 204 On 5 April, while transiting the Gulf of Aden, the frigate responded to a distress call from the yacht Longo Barda which was under attack by pirates. Fredericton was among the Canadian warships that participated in Operation Sharp Guard, enforcing the United Nations blockade of Yugoslavia.Tracy, p. 226 The warship deployed to the Adriatic Sea, joining the blockade force on 14 December 1995.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 314 Fredericton was flagship of the force from 29 February to 11 March 1996. The ship returned to Halifax on 4 April 1996. In 1996, Fredericton took part in a NATO naval exercise in the Norwegian Sea. While returning home from the naval exercise, the ship suffered damage during a storm. The ship deployed three more times to NATO units, in 1997, 2000 and 2001. The frigate sailed to take part in Operation Apollo, Canada's contribution to the War in Afghanistan. The vessel was in theatre from 5 March to 28 August 2003 performing maritime interdiction and fleet support missions. =Fire and collision= A fire broke out in the forward engine room of the frigate on 6 May 2009. The fire was suppressed within a few minutes and the ship made a brief stop at the home base of Halifax before being given the all- clear to return to sea. Fredericton departed Halifax, Nova Scotia on 25 October 2009 to commence her transit to the Gulf of Aden, northern Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman. She integrated into SNMG1 in November 2009 and remained with SNMG1 until February 2010 conducting counter-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden and Somali Basin. Following a Rest and Maintenance Period (RAMP), the vessel integrated into Combined Task Force 150 (CTF 150) to conduct counter- terror patrols in the Gulf of Aden and Gulf of Oman. Fredericton returned home on 4 May 2010, the 100th Anniversary of the Canadian Navy. On 18 November 2010, Fredericton briefly came into contact with during a replenishment-at-sea manoeuvre off the coast of Florida. There were no injuries, but both ships suffered superficial damage consisting of scrapes and dents on both hulls. =Refit= On 6 October 2011, Fredericton was turned over to Irving Shipbuilding's Halifax Shipyards, to start the vessel's FELEX mid-life upgrading and modernization. Fredericton was returned to CFB Halifax Dockyard on 24 January 2013. She completed readiness work-ups (WUPs) in September 2014. Following her refit, Fredericton was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea as part of Operation Reassurance on 30 December 2014. The frigate joined Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 (SNMG2) in the Black Sea in March 2015 for training exercises. As part of SNMG2, Fredericton took part in Exercise \\"Joint Warrior\\", a training exercise off the coast of the United Kingdom in April 2015. Fredericton deployed to the Baltic Sea in June 2015 for training. While there Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Defence Minister Jason Kenney visited the ship. While they were aboard, the frigate was tailed by two Russian ships keeping a distance of . The frigate returned from deployment on 12 July 2015. During a routine inspection in November, fissures were found in the hull requiring repairs at Halifax. Following completion of repairs, the ship relieved in the Mediterranean, sailing on 5 January 2016. During her deployment with SNMG2 in the Mediterranean, Fredericton was charged with halting the smuggling of migrants to Europe. In April it was announced that Fredericton would be one of the test ships for the Royal Canadian Navy's planned reduced crew size trials. Fredericton deployed to Operation Reassurance with a reduced version of the experiment that will be done on sister ship . The same month, SNMG2 deployed to the Black Sea as part of Operation Reassurance. The ship returned to Halifax on 5 July 2016. In September 2016 Fredericton was among the Canadian warships deployed to the NATO naval training exercise \\"Cutlass Fury\\" off the east coast of North America. In November the frigate sailed to the Caribbean Sea visiting several nations. Fredericton stopped at Cuba to make the first port visit by a Canadian warship in 50 years to the country. On 20 January 2020, Fredericton departed Halifax as part of Operation Reassurance in the Mediterranean and Black seas. While in the Mediterranean, the frigate made a port call in Italy in March, sparking concerns over possible infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, no cases were found aboard the ship and the vessel was ordered to cancel a number of other port calls while continuing its mission. = Helicopter crash = On 29 April 2020, it was reported the frigate's Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone had crashed into the Ionian Sea, near the Greek island of Cephalonia. The helicopter had been returning from a NATO training mission, with six members of the Canadian Armed Forces onboard, at the time of the incident. Of the six service members killed, four were members of the Royal Canadian Air Force, with the remaining two members of the Royal Canadian Navy. As of 1 May 2020, only one body has been recovered, with the remaining victims missing and presumed dead.

The potential temperature is denoted \\\\theta and, for a gas well-approximated as ideal, is given by : \\\\theta = T \\\\left(\\\\frac{P_0}{P}\\\\right)^{R/c_p}, where T is the current absolute temperature (in K) of the parcel, R is the gas constant of air, and c_p is the specific heat capacity at a constant pressure. R/c_p = 0.286 for air (meteorology).  Contexts  The concept of potential temperature applies to any stratified fluid. It is most frequently used in the atmospheric sciences and oceanography. The reason that it is used in both fluids is that changes in pressure can result in warmer fluid residing under colder fluid – examples being dropping air temperature with altitude and increasing water temperature with depth in very deep ocean trenches and within the ocean mixed layer. When potential temperature is used instead, these apparently unstable conditions vanish as a parcel of fluid is invariant along its isolines.  Comments  Potential temperature is a more dynamically important quantity than the actual temperature. This is because it is not affected by the physical lifting or sinking associated with flow over obstacles or large-scale atmospheric turbulence. A parcel of air moving over a small mountain will expand and cool as it ascends the slope, then compress and warm as it descends on the other side- but the potential temperature will not change in the absence of heating, cooling, evaporation, or condensation (processes that exclude these effects are referred to as dry adiabatic). Since parcels with the same potential temperature can be exchanged without work or heating being required, lines of constant potential temperature are natural flow pathways. Under almost all circumstances, potential temperature increases upwards in the atmosphere, unlike actual temperature which may increase or decrease. Potential temperature is conserved for all dry adiabatic processes, and as such is an important quantity in the planetary boundary layer (which is often very close to being dry adiabatic). Potential temperature and hydrostatic stability Potential temperature is a useful measure of the static stability of the unsaturated atmosphere. Under normal, stably stratified conditions, the potential temperature increases with height, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z} > 0 and vertical motions are suppressed. If the potential temperature decreases with height, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z} < 0 the atmosphere is unstable to vertical motions, and convection is likely. Since convection acts to quickly mix the atmosphere and return to a stably stratified state, observations of decreasing potential temperature with height are uncommon, except while vigorous convection is underway or during periods of strong insolation. Situations in which the equivalent potential temperature decreases with height, indicating instability in saturated air, are much more common. Since potential temperature is conserved under adiabatic or isentropic air motions, in steady, adiabatic flow lines or surfaces of constant potential temperature act as streamlines or flow surfaces, respectively. This fact is used in isentropic analysis, a form of synoptic analysis which allows visualization of air motions and in particular analysis of large-scale vertical motion. Potential temperature perturbations The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) potential temperature perturbation is defined as the difference between the potential temperature of the ABL and the potential temperature of the free atmosphere above the ABL. This value is called the potential temperature deficit in the case of a katabatic flow, because the surface will always be colder than the free atmosphere and the PT perturbation will be negative.  Derivation  The enthalpy form of the first law of thermodynamics can be written as: : dh = T \\\\, ds + v \\\\, dp, where dh denotes the enthalpy change, T the temperature, ds the change in entropy, v the specific volume, and p the pressure. For adiabatic processes, the change in entropy is 0 and the 1st law simplifies to: : dh = v \\\\, dp. For approximately ideal gases, such as the dry air in the Earth's atmosphere, the equation of state, pv = RT can be substituted into the 1st law yielding, after some rearrangement: : \\\\frac{dp}{p} = {\\\\frac{c_p}{R}\\\\frac{dT}{T}}, where the dh = c_{p}dT was used and both terms were divided by the product pv Integrating yields: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{p_1}{p_0}\\\\right)^{R/c_p} = \\\\frac{T_1}{T_0}, and solving for T_{0}, the temperature a parcel would acquire if moved adiabatically to the pressure level p_{0}, you get: : T_0 = T_1 \\\\left(\\\\frac{p_0}{p_1}\\\\right)^{R/c_p} \\\\equiv \\\\theta.  Potential virtual temperature  The potential virtual temperature \\\\theta_{v}, defined by : \\\\theta_v = \\\\theta \\\\left( 1 + 0.61 r - r_L \\\\right), is the theoretical potential temperature of the dry air which would have the same density as the humid air at a standard pressure P0. It is used as a practical substitute for density in buoyancy calculations. In this definition \\\\theta is the potential temperature, r is the mixing ratio of water vapor, and r_L is the mixing ratio of liquid water in the air.  Related quantities  The Brunt–Väisälä frequency is a closely related quantity that uses potential temperature and is used extensively in investigations of atmospheric stability.

He was one of the inaugural recipients of the title International Grandmaster from FIDE in 1950. He became a naturalized British citizen after World War II.p258 Chess career Born Jakob Mieses in Leipzig, Germany in 1865, his early successes as an adult chess player included a tie for second at Leipzig and third at Nuremberg in 1888, however he was quickly eclipsed by two rising young superstars, Emanuel Lasker and Siegbert Tarrasch. Mieses attained maturity as a player in 1895, just after turning 30, when he contested the 9th Chess Congress in Leipzig, followed by an exhibition tour in Russia and then a match with David Janowski. His participation in the great Hastings tournament that year was important to his growth as a mature chess master despite a 20th-place finish. Mieses was a dangerous attacker with a number of famous victories to his credit, e.g. against Frank Marshall (Monte Carlo 1903).Mieses vs. Marshall His best achievement was to win the first Trebitsch Memorial at Vienna 1907, and he came third at the 28-round Masters tournament at Ostend the same year.tournament crosstable He organized the 1911 San Sebastian master tournament and insisted that all the masters' expenses were paid. This was the first international tournament of José Raúl Capablanca, who surprised everyone by winning. After the Nazi takeover of Germany, the Jewish Mieses moved to the UK. In 1950 he became the first FIDE-authorized British grandmaster, though not (as is sometimes claimed) the first British grandmaster. (\\"Grandmaster\\" is a title first used of chess players in the 19th century,Hooper, David and Kenneth Whyld 1996. The Oxford companion to chess. 2nd ed, Oxford University Press. p156 and a number of British players were considered to be grandmasters in their day, such as Howard Staunton and Joseph Blackburne. When FIDE first awarded the grandmaster title in 1950, Mieses was one of the 27 original recipients, and the oldest of them. Mieses, now past the age of 70, settled in England in 1938 following Kristallnacht in Germany, and arrived with just 15 Reichsmarks in his pocket. He continued to actively play chess and participated in his last major event at Hastings 1946, when he was 80 years old and half a century after Hastings 1895. The octogenarian Mieses only won a single game against a 22-year-old opponent, but secured the brilliancy prize for a game-winning attack combination. Three years later, at 84, he defeated the 86-year-old Dutch master Dirk van Foreest,Dirk van Foreest vs Jacques Mieses, The Hague, 1949. afterwards commenting \\"Youth has been victorious\\" and also gave a series of exhibition matches in western Europe. He died in February 1954, a few days before his 89th birthday. Mieses's professional chess career lasted 64 years, a record that still stands as of 2018. His durability at an advanced age was attributed to his belief in physical fitness; he engaged in daily swims until almost the end of his life. Mieses wrote many tournament reports, but his style was regarded as fairly dry, in contrast with his wittiness in person. Legacy Mieses largely adhered to the 19th century Romantic school of play and showed little aptitude for positional chess. He used almost exclusively e4 openings and he was the last chess master of note to make any serious use of the Center Game and Vienna Game. On the Black side of an e4 opening, he generally used the French Defense or Sicilian Defense. The Queen's Gambit and Dutch Defense were his usual replies to d4 openings. He often used the Scandinavian Defense and greatly developed its theory in the early 1900s. The chess opening 1.d3 is named the Mieses Opening.

Charlottetown is the tenth ship in her class which is based on the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project. She is the third vessel to carry the designation . Charlottetown, assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and homeported at CFB Halifax, serves on missions protecting Canada's sovereignty in the Atlantic Ocean and enforcing Canadian laws in its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone. Charlottetown has also participated in several NATO missions, patrolling the Atlantic Ocean as part of Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) and its successors Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 and 2 (SNMG1 / SNMG2). Charlottetown has also been deployed on missions throughout the Atlantic and to the Indian Ocean, specifically the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea on anti-terrorism operations. Description and design The Halifax-class frigate design, emerging from the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project, was ordered by the Canadian Forces in 1977 as a replacement for the aging , , , and es of destroyer escorts, which were all tasked with anti-submarine warfare.Milner, p. 284 Charlottetown was ordered in December 1987 as part of the second batch of frigates.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 291Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 47 To reflect the changing long term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the Halifax-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities. As built, the Halifax-class vessels displaced and were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of .Saunders, p. 90 That made them slightly larger than the Iroquois-class destroyers. The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating . This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . The Halifax class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers. =Armament and aircraft= As built the Halifax-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a \\"bear trap\\" system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The Halifax class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar. As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface-to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for \\"last- ditch\\" defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow. As built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than . The vessels also carry eight machine guns. =Countermeasures and sensors= As built, the decoy system comprises Two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship's radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada. Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503. =Modernization= The Halifax class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates' capabilities in combatting modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program. The FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire control radars were replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 re-control radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall's Multi- Ammunition Soft kill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard and the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile. Service history Charlottetowns keel was laid down on 18 December 1993 by Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd. at Saint John, New Brunswick. The vessel was launched on 1 October 1994 and commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 9 September 1995 at Charlottetown, carrying the hull classification symbol FFH 339.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 292 In 1996, the frigate sailed to join NATO's Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) and performed a series of naval exercises with Eastern European nations. In 1997, after becoming the first Canadian warship to pass beneath the Confederation Bridge, the vessel participated in US naval exercises. In 1998, Charlottetown performed another stint with STANAVFORLANT beginning in February, replacing sister ship . In January 2001, Charlottetown sailed to the Persian Gulf to join the Carrier Battle Group, enforcing sanctions against Iraq. Following Canada's entry into the War in Afghanistan, Charlottetown was part of the initial naval task force sent to the Arabian Sea. Composed of , Charlottetown and , the task force sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia on 17 October 2001 arrived in theatre on 20 November.Tracy, p. 265 Charlottetown was incorporated into a US amphibious ready group escorting United States Marine Corps troop transports near Pakistan. Charlottetown returned to Halifax on 27 April 2002. In 2008 the frigate made significant narcotics interceptions. A dhow was caught loaded with four tonnes of hashish, close to Pakistani waters. The impounded vessel and crew were handed over to the Pakistan Coast Guard.Warships International Fleet Review, May 2008 p. 25 = Mediterranean deployments = On 2 March 2011, Charlottetown left its home port of Halifax to join the NATO-led air-sea Operation Unified Protector during the 2011 Libyan civil war. Charlottetown worked in conjunction with an American carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier . The stated mission was to help restore peace, evacuate Canadian citizens in Libya and provide humanitarian relief. On 18 March the Canadian government expanded the mission by announcing that HMCS Charlottetown, in addition to six CF-18 fighter aircraft and two CC-177 transport aircraft, would constitute Canada's contribution to the enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, aimed to protect Libya's civilian population (Operation Mobile). By 21 March, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Charlottetown was patrolling the waters off north Libya. On 12 May, the frigate engaged several small boats involved in an attack on the port city of Misrata. Later that month on 30 May, the frigate came under fire from a dozen BM-21 rockets while patrolling off the Libyan coast, but no damage or injuries were reported. In July 2011, relieved Charlottetown, which returned to Halifax. Charlottetown departed Halifax on 8 January 2012 to join the NATO-led mission Operation Active Endeavor. The mission was an anti-terrorism deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. At the time of departure Commander Wade Carter said to the media that there were no plans for Charlottetown to intervene in the conflict in Syria. The frigate was sent to relieve HMCS Vancouver. = Maritime security operations = Charlottetown transited the Suez Canal on 23 April 2012 to join Combined Task Force 150, conducting counter-terrorism operations in the Arabian Sea. She returned to Halifax on 11 September 2012. While on deployment, Charlottetown was the test ship for the unmanned aerial vehicle Boeing Insitu ScanEagle. During her service in the Arabian Sea one of the ScanEagle UAVs, which had been deployed from the ship, was lost due to engine failure. The navy later denied that it had been found by Iran, which had captured a ScanEagle drone around the same time. The vessel completed the FELEX modernisation in June 2014. On 27 June 2016 Charlottetown sailed from Halifax to join NATO's Operation Reassurance in the Mediterranean Sea. While deployed overseas, twenty members of the crew contracted hand, foot, and mouth disease. In October, Charlottetown took part in the multinational naval exercise Joint Warrior off the coast of Scotland. The vessel returned to Canada on 13 January 2017 and conducted a full crew change. Charlottetown re- deployed to Europe on 8 August 2017, relieving sister ship . Charlottetown joined Standing NATO Maritime Group One (SNMG1) in support of Operation Reassurance. During the deployment, Charlottetown patrolled the Baltic Sea in August taking part in exercise Northern Coast, on completion she transited south taking part in the NATO naval exercise Brilliant Mariner in the Mediterranean Sea in September–October. Charlottletown returned to Halifax on 19 January 2018, having visited eleven ports during the deployment. In August, Charlottetown and departed Halifax to take part in Operation Nanook, travelling to Iqaluit, Nunavut and Nuuk, Greenland.

He was an outspoken critic of censorship during the reign of General Francisco Franco. His most noteworthy plays include Death Squad (1953), The Gag (1954), Death Thrust (1960), and Tragicomedy of the Gypsy Celestina (1984). Biography Alfonso Sastre was born into a typical middle-class family. He had three siblings (Aurora, Ana and Jose), and received a Catholic upbringing. He survived hunger and bombing during the Spanish Civil War and later received a degree from the Institute Cardinal Cisneros of Madrid. In 1943 he began a career as an aeronautical engineer, which he abandoned after fifteen days. By the end of the 1940s, he began producing existentialist works, either alone or with others in the \\"New Art\\" movement. In 1950 he signed, along with Jose M. de Quinto, the Theater of Social Agitation Manifesto (TAS), and vehemently defended, through books and newspapers, the use of theater as a means of social agitation. In 1953 he completed his studies and had his first success in the theater, Escuadra Hacia la Muerte, roughly translated as Death Squad. It premiered on March 18, 1953, and was performed by the University Popular Theater (TPU). The play took place during the Third World War and dealt with a squad of five soldiers and their corporal, sent on a suicide mission as punishment for past transgressions. Only one performance was initially scheduled, but it found success and its run was extended. The play was censored by Franco's regime after its third performance, however, and was never performed again. On 17 September 1954 the play La Mordaza (The Gag) premiered, dealing with themes of dictatorship and repression. That same year he wrote the revolutionary drama Tierra Roja (Red Earth), which was never allowed to be presented as it dealt with the subject of exploitation. Sastre continued to write plays such as La Sangre de Dios, Ana Kleiber (The Blood of God, Ana Kleiber) and Guillermo Tell tiene los ojos tristes (William Tell Has Sad Eyes) in 1955. In 1959 he wrote En la red (In the Net) and La Cornada (The Thrust). In 1990 he wrote ¿Dónde estás, Ulalume, dónde estás? (Where are you, Ulalume? Where are you?).

Created during World War II from the Vancouver Half Company of the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve, Discovery was used for recruitment and training, and provided almost 8,000 personnel during the war. Discovery continued in its training role following the war, and also serves as headquarters for several Reserve and Cadet units. The stone frigate takes its name from , the ship used by George Vancouver to chart most of North America's north-western coast. Originally based at the Stanley Park Barracks, in 1944 Discovery moved to its current location on Deadman's Island, in Coal Harbour, adjacent to Stanley Park. Her Majesty's Canadian Ship (HMCS) Discovery has a crew of about 140 officers and non- commissioned members (NCMs). The 2018 command team consists of: Commanding Officer, Commander Bryan Price; Executive Officer, Lieutenant-Commander Stuart Evans; Coxswain, Chief Petty Officer Second Class Susie Robinson. History =World wars= Discovery traces its history to the creation of the \\"Number 2 (Vancouver) Company\\" of the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve at the beginning of the First World War. This small group was composed of 87 members of the Royal Vancouver Yacht Club who served and were demobilized at the end of the war. It was not until May 1924 that Lieutenant-Commander J.W. Hobbs was given permission to form the first \\"Vancouver Half Company\\" of the Naval Volunteer Reserve. Robert Louis Stevenson's schooner Casco was used for a time to train cadets in the 1920s. During the Second World War, the role of the reserves increased, reflecting the need to maintain sufficient manpower for the war effort. On 1 November 1941, the division was newly commissioned as HMCS Discovery and it moved into Stanley Park Barracks. In 1944, the unit was permitted to occupy Deadman Island in Stanley Park and turn this property into a training facility. During the Second World War, Discovery was one of the greatest sources of naval recruits in Canada, having enrolled 372 officers, 6,974 ratings and 650 Wrens (Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service – WRCNS). Of those, 15 were killed in action. At the end of the war, Discovery became the discharge centre for the whole of the British Columbia mainland, and 8,378 men and women were discharged through the base. =Modern era= HMCS Discovery continues to serve as a training facility, force generating personnel for Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) operations. Discovery personnel have been deployed to Korea, the Persian Gulf, Egypt, Bosnia and Afghanistan. The facility provided support for the 1997 APEC meeting in Vancouver. It was the Olympic Maritime Operations Centre for the 2010 Winter Olympics and conducted port security around the country. It is also the site of the Western Region Diving Centre, coordinating the efforts of the various port inspection diving teams at Naval Reserve Divisions in Western Canada. The unit continues to serve as host and ambassador to dozens of foreign vessels visiting the Port of Vancouver. In addition to the Naval Reserve, Discovery houses Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps Captain Vancouver and Navy League Cadet Corps Captain Rankin. Discovery is also the site of the Naval Museum of Vancouver and Vancouver Naval Veterans Association. Badge thumb It was suggested by Sir Arthur W.

Prince Asahiko was an adopted son of Emperor Ninkō and later a close advisor to Emperor Kōmei and Emperor Meiji. He was the great-great-grandfather of the present Emperor of Japan, Naruhito. Early life Prince Asahiko was born in Kyoto, the fourth son of Prince Fushimi Kuniye, the twentieth head of the Fushimi-no-miya, the oldest of the four branches of the imperial dynasty allowed to provide a successor to the Chrysanthemum throne should the main imperial house fail to produce an heir. The future Prince Asahiko had several childhood appellations and acquired several more titles and names over the years. He was often known as Prince Asahiko (Asahiko Shinnō) and Prince Nakagawa (Nakagawa-no-miya). He was a half-brother of Prince Yamashina Akira, Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito, Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa, Prince Fushimi Sadanaru, and Prince Kan'in Kotohito. Buddhist priest From an early age, Prince Asahiko was groomed to pursue a career as a Buddhist priest, the traditional career path for non-heir sons in the sesshu shinnōke during the Edo period. He was sent as an acolyte to Honnō- ji in 1831, but was transferred to Ichijō-in, an abbacy of Kōfuku-ji in Nara in 1836. In 1838, he was adopted by Emperor Ninkō. That same year, he succeeded an uncle as the abbot of Kōfuku-ji and formally entered the priesthood under the title Sonya Hoshinnō. In 1852, Emperor Kōmei transferred him to Shōren-in, a major monzeki temple of the Tendai sect in Kyoto and he assumed the title Shōren no miya Son'yu. Asahiko was also known as Awata no miya or Awataguchi no miya after the location of that temple. During this period, the prince became an outspoken advocate of jōi , the expulsion of all foreigners from Japan. His popularity among the Ishin Shishi (the pro-imperial court nationalist patriots) attracted the attention of Ii Naosuke, daimyō of Hikone and the Tairō during the final illness of Shōgun Tokugawa Iesada. When Ii launched the Ansei Purge, the prince was condemned to perpetual confinement at Shōkoku-ji and spent more than two years living in a tiny, dilapidated hut. This disrespectful treatment of the prince enraged the shishi, who made his release one of their principal objectives. Meiji Restoration and afterwards In 1862, the prince was allowed to return to secular status and received the title Nakagawa no miya. This was part of the amnesty declared in honor of the marriage of Shōgun Tokugawa Iemochi, to Kazu-no-miya, the Emperor Kōmei's half-sister. He returned to Kyoto, became a close advisor of the emperor, and became known by yet another title, Kaya-no-miya at this time. In September 1863, Kōmei bestowed on him the name \\"Asahiko\\" and the status of a prince of the blood (shinnō), and named him Danjō no in, a high ranking court position open only to princes of the blood. Prince Asahiko continued in this post following the death of Kōmei and the ascension of the Meiji emperor. After the Meiji Restoration, Prince Asahiko's political enemies did not relent. In 1868, he was deprived of his status as a prince of the blood and exiled to Hiroshima on trumped-up charges of plotting to overthrow the new government. Emperor Meiji pardoned him in February 1872, restoring his princely status and allowing him to start a new collateral branch of the imperial dynasty, the Kuni-no-miya. He spent the last two decades of his life as the lord custodian priest (saishu) of the Shinto Grand Shrine of Ise. Prince Kuni Asahiko died in Tokyo in 1891. Three of Prince Asahiko's sons, Prince Kaya Kuninori, Prince Kuni Taka, and Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, successively served as lord custodian priests of the Ise Shrine between 1891 and 1947. Prince Asahiko's son Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi was the father of Princess Nagako of Kuni, who married the future Emperor Shōwa and became the mother of the recent emperor Akihito, who abdicated in favor for his son, Naruhito present day an emperor Progenitor of new imperial families Prince Kuni Asahiko was the father of at least eighteen children (nine sons and nine daughters) by at least five different court ladies: (1) Izumitei Shizue, second daughter of Izumitei Shun'eki, a priest at Kamo Shrine, Kyoto, (2) Izumi Makiko, (3) Harada Mitsue, (4) Tarao Utako, and (5) Tsunoda Sugako. Emperor Meiji directed Prince Asahiko's second, eighth, and ninth sons to found new collateral branches of the imperial family with the hereditary rank of a minor prince of the blood (ōke): Kaya-no-miya, Asaka-no-miya, and Higashikuni-no-miya. Prince Asakiko's seventh son succeeded to the head of the existing Nashimoto-no-miya house. His fourth born son succeeded him as the second head of the Kuni-no-miya. # , (10 April 1864 – 14 September 1866), by Izumitei Shizue. # Prince Muchimaro, (25 March 1865 – 10 January 1866) by Izumitei Shizue. # (1 September 1867 – 8 December 1909), by Izumitei Shizue. # , (18 February 1868 – 9 January 1949) by Izumi Makiko.

He is credited with having located the body of copper ore, which later was known as the Copper Queen Mine, one of Arizona's most productive copper mines. Warren drank too much and bet his interest in the mine on a foot race against a horse and lost. In 1880 pioneer photographer C. S. Fly often visited Bisbee on miners' paydays and he took a photo of Warren. The image was used as a model for the miner posing with long-handled spade on the Seal of Arizona.History of the Great Seal of the State of Arizona His pauper's grave, originally only marked by a wooden plank saying \\"G.W. 24\\" in the Bisbee-Lowell Evergreen Cemetery was later commemorated by a large monument erected in his honor. Biography A second image of George Warren by C.S. Fly George's mother died when he was very young and he lived with a maiden aunt until he was 10, when he was sent to New Mexico to join his father, who was a government teamster and later a herder. While herding horses, the Warrens were attacked by Apaches. George was wounded and his father was killed. George was held captive for 18 months until prospectors saw the white boy among the Indians and traded 15-20 pounds of sugar for Warren's freedom.Hart, J.H. (1926) History of George Warren: unpublished manuscript, Arizona Historical Society files, 17 p Warren remained with these men for some time and learning about prospecting. = Ore discovery = The presence of copper ore in the Mule Mountains of southeast Arizona may have been known as early as 1876, but the first mining claim was filed on August 2, 1877. In 1877, a U.S. Cavalry patrol from Fort Bowie was tracking Apache Indians and camped at what is today known as Iron Springs. The men didn't like the quality of the water and they sent Scout Jack Dunn to look for better quality water. During his search he found a spring along a very large cliff of limestone, known today as Castle Rock, and on his return an outcrop containing lead carbonate, which was known to carry silver, in a gorge later known as Tombstone Canyon. Dunn told his commanding officer Lt. John Rucker and a packer named Ted Byrne of his discovery. They named the find the \\"Rucker\\" and planned to file a claim, but were delayed when their patrol was ordered to resume pursuit of a band of Apache warriors. Before departing Fort Bowie, they met a 42-year old George Warren and persuaded him to file a claim for them with the agreement that Warren would name Dunn in all notices of locations for mining claims that he located. They provided him with a grubstake, provisions, and a map to mining claim site. Warren didn't keep his agreement with Dunn. On his way to the claims office, Warren stopped in a saloon, got drunk, and gambled away the grubstake given him by Dunn and the others. He went to Fort Huachuca and recruited additional backers from Tombstone. On September 27, 1877, 56 days after Dunn located the Rucker Mine, Warren filed a claim for the Mercy Mine up Mule Pass Canyon from Iron Spring. Over the next six months his name is mentioned either as the locator or witness in several other claims in the Tombstone Canyon and Mule Mountains and established what became known as the Warren Mining District. He held a one- ninth interest in the new Copper Queen mine. = Loses mining claim in a bet = George had a reputation as a drunk and got into fights. He was shot through the neck when fighting a duel and was shot in the arm and a leg on another occasion. The first wagon and team was dispatched into the mining region to bring a barrel of whisky to Warren. While drinking with acquaintances in Charleston, the milling town for Tombstone, he argued with his friend George W. Atkins about the agility and speed of men versus horses. Warren claimed he could outrun a man on a horse over a distance of . Atkins took the bet. If Atkins beat Warren, Atkins was to receive Warren's interest in the Copper Queen; if Warren beat Atkins, Warren was to receive Atkins's horse. A fair portion of the few hundred citizens of Charleston turned out on July 3, 1880 to watch the race. Warren placed a stake in the ground at , believing he could beat the horse on the corner, but lost the bet and his one- ninth interest in the Copper Queen Mine, later estimated to be worth US$20,000,000 (or about $ today).Duncan, J.F. (1911) \\"The Very Beginning of Bisbee\\", Bisbee Daily Review 14 November 3, 1911 Entrepreneurs Edward Reilly and Levi Zeckendorf bought an option to purchase the mine in 1880 for US$20,000. When the ore assayed at 22% copper, Reilly became enthusiastic about the mine's possibilities. He bought out others' interest in the claims in April, 1880, and went to San Francisco to see if he could market his option on the claims. Reilly persuaded engineers DeWitt Bisbee, William H. Martin, and John Ballard in San Francisco to visit the mine, and they were pleased with the prospects. On May 12, 1880, Martin and Ballard agreed to furnish the funds to mine and smelt the ore and received seven-tenths interest in the Copper Queen mine and two-thirds interest in the Copper King. Reilly retained the remainder. James Douglas, who had invented new methods of smelting copper, learned of the Warren mining district early on. He was sent by the Phelps Dodge company of Pennsylvania to examine potential copper mines. During his research, Douglas concluded the risk was great but persuaded the company they should go forward. Offered the choice of a flat fee or a 10% interest in the property for his services, he chose the latter, a decision that subsequently made him a fortune.Robert Paul Browder and Thomas G. Smith, Independent: A Biography of Lewis W. Douglas (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1986), p. 7 The company bought the Atlanta Mine and poured over $76,000 (or about $ today) into exploration before they found the ore body. When the claims and ore bodies in the area would likely overlap, leading to potential costly litigation, they merged with their neighbor the Copper Queen mine, forming the Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company in 1885. Reilly raised $80,000 capital from Dewitt Bisbee to begin production. The surface pockets of cerussite were soon exhausted, but the owners found that the ore body ran 23% copper, with silver and gold as byproducts. Most mines of that era could profitably mine ore containing 3% or 4% copper, so the Copper Queen ore body was considered extraordinarily high grade. The surface oxide ore was exhausted after three or four years, but miners explored deeper and eventually found even larger ore bodies. = Declared insane = In May 1881, G.W. Atkins asked Cochise County Court Probate Judge J.H. Lucas to rule that Warren was insane, and George Praidham was appointed as Warren's guardian with the charge to sell his assets. On June 1, 1881, Warren's interest in three mines—a one-twelfth interest in the Mammoth Mine, a one-third interest in the Safford Mine, and his one-third interest in the Crescent Mine—were sold at public auction for US$923. He was released soon after his property was sold. He was declared sane by the Cochise County Probate Court on 11/13/1883. He then went into Mexico where in 1885 he discovered a mining claim in Mexico and to gain legal title he became a Mexican citizen. He sold himself into peonage to pay off a debt of US$40. He worked as an interpreter for the district judge in Oposura, Mexico, for twenty-five pesos a day. When Judge G.H. Berry learned of his situation, he paid Warren's debt and Warren returned to Bisbee. The mining company provided him a small pension, and Warren worked as a blacksmith and tool dresser, but he finally resorted to the life of a \\"rounder\\"Wiktionary definition of rounder: 4. A person who makes the rounds of bars, saloons, and similar establishments as the miners called it. He swept floors or cleaned the cuspidors in exchange for a drink of whisky.Graeme, R.W..

Greeley = Death = Sources for Warren's death date differ. The plaque on his cemetery monument at the Bisbee-Lowell Evergreen Cemetery lists the date of death as 1892. A Cochise County death certificate for a George Warren states he died of pneumonia and heart failure on February 13, 1893. An Arizona Republic article on September 15, 1897 stated Warren had died \\"three years ago.\\"Arizona Republic (1897). \\"The Camp of Bisbee - The Big Copper Mining Camp Visited by the Republican Traveler\\"; p. 4 Penniless at the time of his death, Warren was buried in a pauper's grave and was practically forgotten for a number of years.  Legacy  Arizona State Seal Originally buried in a pauper's grave in Bisbee-Lowell Evergreen Cemetery under a small, wooden grave marker, the Bisbee Elk's Lodge launched a campaign in 1914 to erect a monument over his grave. When his grave was located, his body was moved to a more prominent location and a large monument was erected. A plaque on the monument depicts C.S. Fly's image of him and the words,\\" George Warren Born unknown Died 1892 Poor in Purse Rich in Friends.\\" C.S. Fly's photograph of Warren was the model for the miner incorporated into the Arizona State Seal, and the mining district around Bisbee was named for him. A suburb planned and built near Bisbee and Warren Ballpark in Bisbee were named after Warren.

Originally located in Mississauga, it relocated to Brampton in 2008. Holy Name of Mary Catholic Secondary School is the only single-sex school in the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board.https://www.dpcdsb.org/HNMRY/General+Information/History+of+Holy+Name+of+Mary.htm  History  Both Holy Name of Mary Catholic Secondary School and Holy Name of Mary College School can trace their origin to the original Holy Name of Mary School (HNM) founded September 7, 1964, by the Felician Sisters. Founded as a private school on Mississauga Road, the Felician Sisters entered into an agreement with the Dufferin-Peel Separate School Board in 1972 making Grades 9 and 10 publicly funded. In 1984, the Ontario government announced full funding for Catholic high schools, and by 1987 Holy Name was funded up to Grade 13. In a document dated January 3, 2005, the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board released a planning committee report on the future of the school including options: (1) relocate the students to the vacant Loyala facility. (2) purchase the school from the Sisters (3) open a single gender boys' school (4) withdraw from single-sex school education. The Planning Committee recommended option 1. This recommendation included opening \\"a consultation process with the Felician Sisters, staff, parents, and students to obtain feedback on all motions approved.\\" A June 2007 Star article stated, \\"Two years ago, the board tried to move the school to another, less attractive location, but parents resisted. Then, the provincial supervisor – who runs the board – axed busing. Parents, however, rallied and arranged for busing on their own. There are more than 600 kids on the bus, out of the 875 at the school, said Charlene Amlinger, chair of the parent council. She said the lack of board- funded transportation may have been the \\"final straw\\" for the sisters.\\" \\"The plight of Holy Name for each year for the last 10 years, whether transportation or relocation – it's been arduous.\\" In a Toronto Star article published in 2007, Holy Name of Mary School was considered one of the finest schools in Ontario. That same year, two years after the submission of the Planning Committee's report, the Felician Sisters terminated the lease with the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board for the Mississauga Road building effective September 2008. The Felician Sisters made this decision, \\"because they didn’t believe the board was committed to maintaining an all- girls school, said spokesperson Sr. Andrea Rita Marie Kowalczyk.\\" \\"We’ve been committed to this (all-girls education) for over 40 years. We weren’t going to drop the ball now,\\" said Kowalczyk. Where the provincially funded board would only commit to a five-year lease with a 15-month opt out clause, the sisters now have a 20-year lease with an option for either party to terminate the lease after five years. Despite the length of time between the board's decision and the Felician Sisters termination of the lease, staff and students at the school seemed ill-prepared for the reality of moving. \\"When the Felician Sisters’ decision regarding the future of Holy Name was announced last Friday, a shockwave went through the school. It was as if someone had died. Staff and students found themselves at a loss for words and, instead, resorted to tears and hugs.\\" A student, Stephanie Paddley stated, \\"I pray the Board will recognize what a gem Holy Name is, and make an effort to preserve what we have, even if it means switching buildings, and getting a new name.\\"http://www.mississauga.com/opinion/editorial/article/5659--hnm-is-more- than-a-school In 2007 the separate board committed itself to keeping the original Holy Name community open as a publicly funded girls' school and, although the vacated Loyola facility was mentioned in the report, decided to use a vacant school site in Brampton as its permanent new home. Holy Name of Mary Catholic Secondary School welcomed students to the Glenvale Boulevard location in September 2008. The school's re-dedication of its new building in Brampton was held on February 11, 2009. The guests included Felician Sisters, Trustees, Board Staff, teachers, alumni, former Principals, clergy and Archbishop Thomas Christopher Collins. The ceremony included a papal blessing for the school.  Felician Sisters  The influence of the Felicians (Congregation of the Sisters of St. Felix of Cantalice) remains essential to the charism of the school. The last Felician Sister to teach in the school was in 1998, but the order continues to influence the lives of staff and students. Change to semester system The school implemented a semester system in September, 2011. Until the end of the 2010/2011 school year, the school followed a non-semester system. The change met considerable opposition from school administration, teachers, parents, and students.http://www.thebramptonnews.com/articles/5039/1/Keeping-Holy-Name-of- Mary-Catholic-Secondary-School-a-TERM-school/Page1.html The issue of changing from a non-semestered system had been raised as early as May 2004. From the Regular Board Meeting minutes dated January 26, 2010, \\"While some trustees spoke in favour of keeping the non-semester, or \\"term\\", others expressed concerns around meeting the needs of the most vulnerable students.\\" \\"Staff has a mandate and moral obligation to improve student achievement and to reduce the gap in student achievement wherever those students might be.

Regina is the fifth vessel in her class which is the name for the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project. She is the second vessel to carry the designation . She is assigned to Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC) and is homeported at CFB Esquimalt. Design and description The Halifax- class frigate design of which Regina belongs, was ordered by the Canadian Forces in 1977 as a replacement for the aging , , , and es of destroyer escorts , which were all tasked with anti-submarine warfare.Milner, p. 284 In July 1983, the federal government approved the budget for the design and construction of the first batch of six new frigates of which Regina was a part, out of twelve that were eventually built.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 291 To reflect the changing long term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the Halifax-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities. As built, the Halifax- class vessels displaced and were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of .Saunders, p. 90 That made them slightly larger than the Iroquois-class destroyers. The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating . This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . The Halifax class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers. =Armament and aircraft= As built the Halifax-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a \\"bear trap\\" system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The Halifax class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar. As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface- to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for \\"last-ditch\\" defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow. As built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than . =Countermeasures and sensors= As built, the decoy system comprises Two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship's radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada. Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503. =Modernization= The Halifax class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates' capabilities in combatting modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program. The FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire control radars wre replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 re-control radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall's Multi- Ammunition Soft kill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard and the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile. Service history Firing Harpoon missiles Rim of the Pacific naval exercise Regina wearing a commemorative \\"dazzle\\" camouflage, in August 2020. Regina was laid down on 6 October 1989 by Marine Industries at Sorel, Quebec and launched on 25 October 1991. The ship was provisionally accepted on 2 March 1994, and following sea trials, sailed to CFB Esquimalt. The frigate was commissioned into the Canadian Forces there on 30 September 1994 and carries the hull classification symbol FFH 334.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 294 In May 1995, with sister ship , Regina sailed to Southeast Asia for naval exercises. The following year in March, this time with the auxiliary ship , the destroyer and frigate , Regina returned to the Eastern Pacific for naval exercises. During this trip the ship visited Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, the first North American warship to do so since the Vietnam War. On the return trip, the task group participated in the RIMPAC naval exercise off the coast of Hawaii.Milner, p. 312 In February 1997, the ship sailed to join a United States Navy carrier battle group in the Persian Gulf to enforce trade sanctions on Iraq. The ship returned to the Persian Gulf from June to December 1999 with the carrier battle group to enforce sanctions again.Tracy, p. 260 In February 2003, Regina deployed to the Indian Ocean as part of Operation Apollo in support of the War in Afghanistan.Milner, p. 319 The ship remained in theatre until May.Milner, p. 320 Regina sailed from Esquimalt on 3 July 2012 to the Arabian Sea and joined Combined Task Force 150 on 21 August. She returned home on 14 March 2013. In 2013, Regina visited Manila, Philippines for a goodwill visit to the Philippines. In 2014 Regina operated off the coast of Somalia as part of Operation Artemis. On 30 April 2014 the Canadian government announced that Regina would be dispatched to assist in NATO operations, concerning the crisis in the Ukraine. The frigate began her FELEX refit in May 2015 and returned to service on 29 April 2016 at CFB Esquimalt. On 6 February 2019, Regina and departed Esquimalt for Pacific operations with other nations' navies. On 18 February, a Cyclone helicopter from Regina was attempting to land on Asterix and was damaged in the operation. Regina, Asterix and the damaged Cyclone were redirected to Guam to undergo inspection. No damage was reported to Asterix, and following air tests of the repaired Cyclone, all three ships resumed their deployment. In March 2019, Regina and Asterix parted ways, with Regina deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Artemis beginning on 26 March. In the Indian Ocean, Regina intercepted a dhow and boarded it, seizing of hashish in 119 bags. As the vessel was international waters, the dhow and its crew were released. The hashish was destroyed. The frigate intercepted a second vessel, this time an unregistered fishing vessel, and seized of hashish in 150 bags. A third seizure took place on 24 April, with of hashish and of heroin netted from a stateless fishing vessel in international waters off Oman and Yemen. The frigate then took part in exercises with a French task force including the , followed up by a fourth seizure of of hashish on 3 May. On 18 June Regina transited the Taiwan Strait as part of a freedom of navigation mission. During the transit alongside Asterix, the ship was \\"buzzed\\" by two Chinese Sukhoi Su-30 fighter aircraft when they flew at a height of within of the frigate.

She is the eleventh of twelve ships in her class which is based on the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project. St. John's is named after the city of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, a port city associated with Canadian naval history and heritage, and is the first ship in the Royal Canadian Navy to bear the name. St. John's serves on Canadian Armed Forces missions protecting Canada's sovereignty in the Atlantic Ocean and enforcing Canadian laws in its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone. St. John's has been deployed on missions throughout the Atlantic Ocean, to the Indian Ocean; specifically the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea on anti-terrorism operations, to the north as far as Grise Fiord and to the Caribbean where she played a role in helping to stop the flow of illicit drugs to North America. She is assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and her homeport is in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Description and design The Halifax-class frigate design, emerging from the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project, was ordered by the Canadian Forces in 1977 as a replacement for the aging , , , and es of destroyer escorts, which were all tasked with anti-submarine warfare.Milner, p. 284 St. John's was ordered in December 1987 as part of the second batch of frigates.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 291Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 47 To reflect the changing long term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the Halifax-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities. As built, the Halifax-class vessels displaced and were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of .Saunders, p. 90 That made them slightly larger than the Iroquois-class destroyers. The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating . This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . The Halifax class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers. =Armament and aircraft= As built the Halifax-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a \\"bear trap\\" system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The Halifax class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar. As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface-to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for \\"last-ditch\\" defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow. As built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than . The vessels also carry eight machine guns. =Countermeasures and sensors= As built, the decoy system comprises Two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship's radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada. Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long- range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503. =Modernization= The Halifax class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates' capabilities in combating modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program. The FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire control radars wre replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 re-control radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall's Multi-Ammunition Soft kill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard and the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile. Construction and career The frigate's keel was laid down on 24 August 1994 by Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd. at their shipyard in Saint John, New Brunswick. The ship was launched on 26 August 1995 and commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 26 June 1996 in St. John's, and carries the hull classification symbol FFH 340.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 295 On 7 August 1997 the frigate joined NATO's Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), returning to Canada on 18 December. The following year, the frigate took part in the NATO naval exercise Strong Resolve off Norway and deployed to the Adriatic Sea for operations with NATO's Standing Naval Force Mediterranean (STANAVFORMED). In 2000, the ship took part in UNITAS, a multi-national naval exercise. As part of Operation Apollo, Canada's contribution to the War in Afghanistan, St. John's sailed to the Gulf of Oman. Leaving Halifax, Nova Scotia on 1 May 2002, the frigate participated in fleet support and maritime interdiction missions. The warship returned to Halifax on 17 November 2002. HMCS St. John's at Charleston, South Carolina in 2010. In 2005, the frigate, with the destroyer , frigate and the Canadian Coast Guard ship were sent to Louisiana to aid in recovery efforts following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina.Tracy, p. 282 In 2008, the vessel took part in Operation Caribbe, Canada's contribution to an ongoing U.S.-led, multinational effort to interdict drug trafficking in the international waters of the Caribbean Basin and eastern Pacific Ocean. In September 2008, the frigate was sent to Haiti, carrying 350 tonnes of food and relief supplies after the nation had been hit by four hurricanes.Tracy, p. 283 In July 2010, St. John's took part in the International Fleet Review at Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Queen Elizabeth II inspected a Guard of Honour on board to mark the centennial of the Royal Canadian Navy, and as part of Canada Day celebrations. In August 2011, St. John's participated in the multinational six-week arctic sovereignty Operation Nanook. During the operation, the ship visited several northern communities and participated in search-and-rescue and disaster response exercises in company with and as well as American and Danish ships. St. John's deployed on Operation Caribbe from 3 October to 14 November 2011. During her deployment, she helped recover a drug cargo from a scuttled self-propelled semi- submersible (SPSS) vessel. The recovery effort included the deployment of the FBI laboratory’s technical dive team, which conducted dive operations on the scuttled SPSS from United States Coast Guard cutter . More than of cocaine was recovered from the vessel. The drugs, destined for distribution in North America, had an estimated street value of US$180 million. During this deployment, the Joint Interagency Task Force South based out of Key West, Florida, coordinated the joint efforts in allowing the US Coast Guard to make 38 arrests, and seized a total of of cocaine and of marijuana, equating to more than US$223 million. On 8 May 2013, the ship suffered an oil spill while at dock in Halifax Harbour. During a transfer of fuel within the ship a leak was spotted and the transfer was halted, but not before a significant amount of oil entered the water. The Royal Canadian Navy was later fined $100,000 for the spill. In the summer of 2013 the crew of St. John's conducted a replacement in place of the crew of Toronto in Kuwait City, Kuwait. Toronto was in the middle of a deployment on Operation Artemis in support of CTF 150. St. John's completed her FELEX refit at Halifax Shipyards in October 2015. = Maritime security operations = The vessel deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in January 2017 to join Standing NATO Maritime Group 2. As part of the deployment, the frigate patrolled the Black Sea. The vessel returned to Canada on 17 July 2017 and was relieved by sister ship . In September 2017, St. John's was deployed the Caribbean Sea to bring relief aid to Turks and Caicos after Hurricane Irma swept through the region. St. John's provided aid to South Caicos. The ship was forced to leave the island after only a week due to the arrival of Hurricane Maria. Following the departure of the storm, St. John's was scheduled to return to South Caicos. However, the frigate was dispatched later that month to bring humanitarian aid to Dominica after Hurricane Maria devastated that island. Once power was restored to the island's airport, St. John's sailed for Canada, arriving 5 October. St. John's departed Halifax on 16 January 2018 for deployment to the Mediterranean Sea as part of Operation Reassurance. The vessel relieved HMCS Charlottetown upon arrival. The frigate returned to Halifax on 23 July, having participated in naval exercises in the northern Atlantic Ocean and Baltic and Mediterranean Seas. The ship was relieved by .

The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503. =Modernization= The Halifax class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates' capabilities in combatting modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program. The FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire control radars wre replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 re-control radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall's Multi- Ammunition Soft kill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard and the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile. Operational history Winnipegs keel was laid down on 20 March 1993 by Saint John Shipbuilding Company at their shipyard in Saint John, New Brunswick. Her engine room modules were constructed at Georgetown, Prince Edward Island and transported to Saint John to be incorporated into the rest of the vessel. The ship was launched on 5 December 1993. The vessel departed Halifax, Nova Scotia on 16 January 1995, sailing to West Coast of Canada. Arriving at Esquimalt, British Columbia, the warship was commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 23 June 1995, and carries the hull classification symbol FFH 338.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 297 In 1996, Winnipeg participated in the multi-national naval exercise RIMPAC 96 in coastal waters off Hawaii. Beginning on 1 April 1997, the frigate joined NATO's Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) for four months. In 1998, Winnipeg participated in the South American naval exercise UNITAS. In March 2001, Winnipeg integrated into the Carrier Battle Group in the Persian Gulf. As part of the carrier battle group, the frigate enforced sanctions against Iraq for six months, returning to Esquimalt on 14 September. The frigate was deployed as part of Operation Apollo, Canada's contribution to the War in Afghanistan. The ship was in theatre from 15 September 2002 to 2 May 2003 performing fleet support missions and maritime interdiction operations. Winnipeg performing underway replenishment training with the destroyer In April 2009, Winnipeg was deployed to the Gulf of Aden to escort United Nations ships carrying famine, plague, and overpopulation relief supplies to East Africa for ten weeks.Tracy, p. 280 After escorting a World Food program ship, Winnipeg came across a pirate attack on the Norwegian tanker . Winnipeg captured the pirates, but they were later released due to Canadian law preventing prosecution. On 12 August 2010, the frigate intercepted , a Thailand-flagged ship carrying Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka, off the coast of British Columbia. In April 2012 Winnipeg was turned over to Seaspan Marine Corporation's Victoria Shipyards, to start an 18-month mid-life upgrading and modernization. On 10 April 2013 Winnipeg was returned to the Royal Canadian Navy to finish the midlife refit. On 23 April 2013, Winnipeg was rammed while docked at CFB Esquimalt, by American sea trawler American Dynasty of the American Seafoods Company. Six people were injured. American Dynasty was being towed to the graving dock for repairs when the fishing vessel accelerated and veered to starboard, hitting the frigate. The resulting investigation found fault with the crew of the fishing vessel and their equipment. Winnipeg, accompanied by , and , departed in October 2014 to take part the Task Group Exercise with the US and Japanese Navies in American coastal waters. In January 2015, Winnipeg was deployed in the eastern Pacific as part of Operation Caribbe 2015, part of a joint multinational effort to eliminate illegal trafficking through the waters around Central America and the Caribbean nations. Winnipeg was deployed to Operation Caribbe for three weeks in June, after which the ship transited the Panama Canal to join NATO's Operation Reassurance in the Mediterranean Sea. The ship left the Mediterranean headed towards the Pacific after being relieved by sister ship . In January 2016, she made port visits to Penang, the first Royal Canadian Navy ship to do so, and Singapore. Winnipeg returned to Esquimalt on 23 February. Winnipeg and sister ship sailed from Esquimalt on 6 March 2017 for six-month deployment visiting several nations around the Pacific, including Malaysia, India, China and Japan among others, returning on 8 August.

Wireworld is particularly suited to simulating transistors, and Wireworld is Turing-complete. Rules Example of a complicated circuit made in WireWorld: a seven-segment display and decoder. Conductor cells are dark green to highlight signal flow and display segments. A Wireworld cell can be in one of four different states, usually numbered 0-3 in software, modeled by colors in the examples here: 0. empty (black), 1. electron head (blue), 2. electron tail (red), 3. conductor (yellow). As in all cellular automata, time proceeds in discrete steps called generations (sometimes \\"gens\\" or \\"ticks\\"). Cells behave as follows: * empty → empty, * electron head → electron tail, * electron tail → conductor, * conductor → electron head if exactly one or two of the neighbouring cells are electron heads, otherwise remains conductor. Wireworld uses what is called the Moore neighborhood, which means that in the rules above, neighbouring means one cell away (range value of one) in any direction, both orthogonal and diagonal.

The other in the pair, in the Louvre, is here Pair of Roman armillae in the shape of snakes, 1st century CE, at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland The Monomachus Crown, possibly an armilla An armill or armilla (from the Latin: armillae remains the plural of armilla) is a type of bracelet, or armlet, normally in metal and worn in pairs, one for each arm. They were usually worn as part of royal regalia, for example at a coronation, or perhaps as part of especially grand liturgical vestments. They may have been worn outside ceremonies. Armillae presumably descend from the Ancient Roman armilla, which was a form of military decoration.Coronation Service These in turn seem to have developed from the armlets worn by some \\"barbarian\\" nations, including the ancient Celts and Scots. The form is variable; all three examples discussed below have completely different forms. Medieval survivals are vanishingly rare; much the most famous pair is now divided between the Louvre and the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg (illustrated), having once been in the Hermitage Museum. These were found in the tomb of Andrei Bogolyubsky, Grand prince of Vladimir-Suzdal (d. 1174), in Vladimir, and may have been gifts from Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1152–90), who received an embassy from the grand-prince in 1165. They are high-quality Mosan work in champlevé enamel on gilded copper, showing the Resurrection of Jesus (Louvre) and Crucifixion (Nuremberg). They probably fitted onto the shoulder, or otherwise would only go part way round the limb, and have holes (six in the Louvre's example) by which they were presumably attached to thongs or bands, or sewn to the clothing below. It is thought they were made for wear by the emperor himself.Louvre website; armilla; Lasko, 218-219; The Year 1200, #174 (the Louvre one) A similar pair were drawn sometime before 1765, and described in a book published in 1790. They were then in the Imperial Treasury in Nuremberg, complete with their thongs for attachment, but they have since disappeared. These had scenes of the Nativity of Jesus and the Presentation in the Temple.Lasko, 218 It has recently been suggested that the enamelled plates from the Monomachus Crown in Budapest showing, but probably not made for, the Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, r. 1042–1055, may in fact come from an armilla rather than a crown, as is normally assumed. These are gold plates, decorated with cloisonné enamel, but despite the lavish materials the workmanship is far from perfect, and the inscriptions contain simple errors; they were perhaps commissioned in a hurry for a special occasion. They were found in 1860 in a field in what is now Slovakia.Dawson, Timothy. Monomachos Crown – Towards a Resolution. Byzantina Symmeikta, Athen 2009. The oldest surviving in the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, where they are usually called armills, are those of King Charles II, and the newest were created for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. The Elizabeth II Armills were presented to the Queen by the governments of various Commonwealth nations and are single-piece round bracelets made of 22 carat gold lined with crimson velvet, with a concealed hinge and spring catch. However most British monarchs have not worn armills when crowned.The Royal Collection. Under the velvet lining they are inscribed \\"Presented for the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II by the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, Ceylon and Southern Rhodesia.\\" The term \\"armilla\\" is used in the English Liber Regalis (probably 1382) to describe a stole, like the Byzantine imperial loros, but this is thought to be a confusion as to the meaning of the word.Coronation Service Notes References * Lasko, Peter, Ars Sacra, 800-1200, Yale University Press, 1995 (2nd edn.) *The Year 1200, Cloisters studies in medieval art, Editors Konrad Hoffmann, Florens Deuchler, # 174, 1970, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), , google books *The Coronation Service of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, CUP Archive, , p. 31-32. * Category:Regalia Category:Types of jewellery ","title":"Armill"},{"id":"2082269","text":"The irregular Z-buffer is an algorithm designed to solve the visibility problem in real-time 3-d computer graphics. It is related to the classical Z-buffer in that it maintains a depth value for each image sample and uses these to determine which geometric elements of a scene are visible. The key difference, however, between the classical Z-buffer and the irregular Z-buffer is that the latter allows arbitrary placement of image samples in the image plane, whereas the former requires samples to be arranged in a regular grid. These depth samples are explicitly stored in a two-dimensional spatial data structure. During rasterization, triangles are projected onto the image plane as usual, and the data structure is queried to determine which samples overlap each projected triangle. Finally, for each overlapping sample, the standard Z-compare and (conditional) frame buffer update are performed. Implementation The classical rasterization algorithm projects each polygon onto the image plane, and determines which sample points from a regularly spaced set lie inside the projected polygon. Since the locations of these samples (i.e. pixels) are implicit, this determination can be made by testing the edges against the implicit grid of sample points. If, however the locations of the sample points are irregularly spaced and cannot be computed from a formula, then this approach does not work. The irregular Z-buffer solves this problem by storing sample locations explicitly in a two- dimensional spatial data structure, and later querying this structure to determine which samples lie within a projected triangle. This latter step is referred to as \\"irregular rasterization\\". Although the particular data structure used may vary from implementation to implementation, the two studied approaches are the kd-tree, and a grid of linked lists. A balanced kd-tree implementation has the advantage that it guarantees O(log(N)) access. Its chief disadvantage is that parallel construction of the kd-tree may be difficult, and traversal requires expensive branch instructions. The grid of lists has the advantage that it can be implemented more effectively on GPU hardware, which is designed primarily for the classical Z-buffer. With the appearance of CUDA, the programmability of current graphics hardware has been drastically improved. The Master Thesis, \\"Fast Triangle Rasterization using irregular Z-buffer on CUDA\\" (see External Links), provide a complete description to an irregular Z-Buffer based shadow mapping software implementation on CUDA. The rendering system is running completely on GPUs. It is capable of generating aliasing-free shadows at a throughput of dozens of million triangles per second. Applications The irregular Z-buffer can be used for any application which requires visibility calculations at arbitrary locations in the image plane.

A. incredibilis presumably became extinct at the same time as the other megafauna in North America.

Anne Beauchamp was the mother of Anne Neville, Queen consort of England as the spouse of King Richard III. Inheritance Anne de Beauchamp was born at Caversham Castle in Oxfordshire (now Berkshire). She married Richard Neville 'the Kingmaker' – and her brother Henry Beauchamp married Richard's sister Cecily – in 1436.Hicks, Michael (1998). Warwick the Kingmaker, p.24. Blackwell, Oxford. . Following the death of Anne's father in 1439, and subsequently that of her brother Henry in 1446, and his infant daughter Lady Anne in 1449, Neville inherited the title and the considerable estates of the Earldom of Warwick through his wife. However, this was contested by Anne's three older half-sisters, children of her father's first marriage to Elizabeth, heir of Berkeley. One of these, Lady Eleanor, was married to Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (killed at the First Battle of St Albans in 1455). The litigation over the Warwick inheritance only fuelled the enmity between this branch of the Nevilles and the Beauforts who were closely related. Anne Beauchamp's husband, Richard, was the grandson of Lady Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, sister of the Duke's late father. Law considered that Anne Beauchamp being a full-blooded aunt of the last countess was more eligible to inherit than her older half-sisters, who were thus not coheirs with her, including the eldest – Lady Margaret, Countess of Shrewsbury (d. 1468). Richard Neville succeeded in keeping the Warwick and Despencer estates intact. Children's marriages Her older daughter, Lady Isabel, married George, Duke of Clarence, the younger brother of King Edward IV of England. Her younger daughter, Lady Anne Neville, was married to Edward of Westminster, the only son of King Henry VI. When Edward of Westminster was killed in the Battle of Tewkesbury, Anne Neville was married to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, later King Richard III of England. Although their mother was still living, the husbands of the two Neville sisters fought over their inheritance, while Anne was declared legally dead by Parliament.Lewis, Matthew (2013) The Wars Of The Roses In 100 Facts, no.80, Amberley Publishing, Stroud. . To win his brother George's final consent to the marriage with Anne, Richard renounced most of Warwick's land and property including the earldoms of Warwick (which the Kingmaker had held in his wife's right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England.Kendall P.M., Richard III, 1955. Reprinted: After George was executed for treason in 1478, his son Edward inherited the title of Earl of Warwick, while Richard's son was styled Earl of Salisbury. Later life Anne died in obscurity, having survived her husband, her daughters and the sons-in-law who had effectively disinherited her. She was in sanctuary at Beaulieu Abbey in 1486 when she petitioned Henry VII for the return of her estate. She recovered a small portion, but only on condition that she broke the entail and remit the bulk of them to Henry VII. \\"The 'Warwick and Spencer lands', her own patrimony became part of the crown estate.\\" Fictional portrayals Anne, Countess of Warwick appears prominently in the Philippa Gregory novels The White Queen (2009), The Red Queen (2010), and The Kingmaker's Daughter (2012), and is played by Juliet Aubrey in the 2013 television adaptation of all three novels, The White Queen. She is depicted as a coldly ambitious mother to Isabel and Anne Neville, and her husband's staunchest supporter. A more sympathetic portrayal of the Countess of Warwick is in the novel The Sunne in Splendour by Sharon Kay Penman, and a maternal view of her is observed in The Reluctant Queen by Jean Plaidy. Novelist Sandra Worth represents the Countess as her husband's conscience in her five novels about the Wars of the Roses. The Countess is depicted as being especially close to her grandson Edward of Middleham. Another sympathetic portrayal of Anne Beauchamp is Wife to the Kingmaker, a 1974 title by Sandra Wilson.

The drug policy is in contrast to the reduction of drug supply, but the two policies are often implemented together. Some discussions of demand reduction make a distinction between policies that address single issues (such as public \\"knowledge-of-harms\\") or are short-term interventions(in-school programs), and those that approach drug demand as a complex issue with multiple social risk factors. Some economists such as Milton Friedman argue that due to the law of supply and demand, reducing demand is the only effective way to reduce drug use long-term. It is questionable, however, whether demand reduction programs actually reduce demand.  Implementation examples  In September 2011, Canada implemented new color graphic depictions of the consequences of smoking, mandating that they cover 75% of the front and back of each carton, health information messages on the inside of the pack, and toxic emissions statements. Each tobacco product features one such image from a series, which includes people dying in hospitals, rotting mouths, and dissected body parts depicting tumors, along with simple bold messages stating that cigarettes cause cancer, mouth disease, impotence, and harm babies. International research supports the efficacy of such warning messages.

It was published in 1970, by George Allen & Unwin in the UK and Alfred A. Knopf in the U.S., with illustrations by Donald Chaffin. The first U.K. Puffin paperback, first issued in 1974, featured illustrations by Jill Bennett. Later editions have featured illustrations by Tony Ross (1988) and Quentin Blake (1996). The story is about Mr. Fox and how he outwits his farmer neighbours to steal their food from right under their noses. In 2009, it was adapted into a film by Wes Anderson. Two audio readings were released, one with the author narrating () and another with Martin Jarvis narrating (). Plot summary Mr. Fox is an anthropomorphic, tricky, and clever fox who lives underground beside a tree with his wife and four children. In order to feed his family, he makes nightly visits to farms owned by three wicked, rude, cruel and dim-witted farmers named Boggis, Bunce and Bean, whereupon he seizes the livestock available on each man's farm. Tired of being outsmarted by Mr. Fox, the triumvirate devise a plan to ambush him as he leaves his burrow, but they succeed only in shooting off his tail. The three then dig up the Foxes' burrow using spades and then excavators. The Foxes manage to escape by burrowing further beneath the earth to safety. The trio are ridiculed for their persistence but they refuse to give up and vow not to return to their farms until they have caught Mr. Fox. They then choose to lay siege to the fox, surrounding Mr. Fox's hole and waiting until he is hungry enough to come out. Cornered by their enemies, Mr. Fox and his family, and all the other underground creatures that lived around the hill, begin to starve. After three days trapped underground, Mr. Fox devises a plot to acquire food. Working from his memory of the routes he has taken above ground, he and his children tunnel through the ground and wind up burrowing to one of Boggis' four chicken houses. Mr. Fox kills several chickens and sends his eldest son to carry the animals back home to Mrs. Fox. On the way to their next destination, Mr. Fox runs into his friend Badger and asks him to accompany him on his mission, as well as to extend an invitation to the feast to the other burrowing animals - Badger and his family, as well as the Moles, the Rabbits and the Weasels - to apologize for getting them caught up in the farmers' hunt. Aided by Badger, the animals tunnel to Bunce's storehouse for ducks, geese, hams, bacon and carrots (as noted by one of the Small Foxes, the Rabbits will require vegetables) and then to Bean's secret cider cellar. Here, they are nearly caught by the Beans' servant Mabel, and have an unpleasant confrontation with the cellar's resident, Rat. They carry their loot back home, where Mrs. Fox has prepared a great celebratory banquet for the starving underground animals and their families. At the table, Mr. Fox invites everyone to live in a secret underground neighbourhood with him and his family, where he will hunt for them daily and where none of them will need to worry about the farmers any more. Everyone joyfully cheers for this idea, while Boggis, Bunce, and Bean are left waiting in vain for the fox to emerge from his hole. The book ends with \\"And so far as I know, they are still waiting.\\" Awards In 1994, Fantastic Mr Fox was awarded the Read Aloud BILBY Award from the Children's Book Council of Australia. Adaptations =Film adaptation= The book was adapted into a film by director Wes Anderson. It was released in 2009 and features the voices of George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox, Bill Murray as Badger, Robert Hurlstone as Boggis, Hugo Guinness as Bunce and Michael Gambon as Bean. The movie's plot focuses more on Mr. Fox's relationship to Mrs. Fox and his son, which is pitted against Mr. Fox's desire to steal chickens as a means of feeling like his natural self. The movie adds scenes before Mr. Fox attacks the three farmers and after their bulldozing of the hill, as well as a slightly altered ending and more background on Mr. Fox's past life as a thief of food. The Foxes' four children are replaced by Ash, a small and insecure fox who seeks his father's approval and Mr. Fox's nephew Kristofferson, who excels in athletics and is a source of jealousy for Ash. =Stage adaptations= The book was adapted into a play of the same name by David Wood and was first performed at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry in 2001. The play is licensed (in the U.K. only) through Casarotto Ramsay Ltd. for repertory performances and Samuel French Ltd. for amateur performances.

Purpose  Generally, in a meeting of a deliberative assembly, business is conducted using a formal procedure of motion, debate, and vote. However, if there are no objections, action could be taken by unanimous consent. The procedure of asking for unanimous consent is used to expedite business by eliminating the need for formal votes on routine questions in which the existence of a consensus is likely. The principle behind it is that procedural safeguards designed to protect a minority can be waived when there is no minority to protect. In non-legislative deliberative bodies operating under Robert's Rules of Order, unanimous consent is often used to expedite the consideration of uncontroversial motions.: \\"Amendments are sometimes so simple or acceptable that they may be adopted by unanimous consent.\\": \\"Sometimes the mere making of a motion for the Previous Question or \\"call for the question\\" may motivate unanimous consent to ending debate.\\" It is sometimes used simply as a time-saving device, especially at the end of the session. Sometimes members do not want a formal recorded vote on the issue, or they know that they would lose such a vote and do not feel a need to take time on it.  Different from unanimous vote  Action taken by unanimous consent does not necessarily mean that it was taken by a unanimous vote. It does not necessarily mean that every member of the body would have voted in favor of the proposal. It may mean that members feeling that it would be useless to oppose a matter would simply acquiesce. For example, passing legislation via unanimous consent does not require that every member of a legislature, a majority of members or even a quorum of representatives to be present to vote. Unanimous consent merely requires that no representative of those present has asked to take a recorded vote or has requested quorum verification. For that reason, a claim that a piece of legislation was passed \\"unanimously\\", when it was really passed via \\"unanimous consent\\", can be misleading as to its level of support.  Unanimous consent required  Certain rights can only be waived by unanimous consent. For example, in disciplinary procedures, a single member can require the vote on the imposition of a penalty to be taken by ballot. When an item is before the assembly for action, such as a resolution, it is the right of every member to have it read once. Another case of this requirement is the reading of the minutes. Unanimous consent is required to not do the reading. Any member can request that the minutes be read and it would have to be done. A series of independent resolutions may be offered in a single motion. Unanimous consent is required to consider such a motion in one vote. Any member can demand a separate vote on one or more of the independent resolutions.  Procedure  Unanimous consent can be obtained by the chair asking if there are any objections to doing something. For instance, the chair may state, \\"If there is no objection, the motion will be adopted. [pause] Since there is no objection, the motion is adopted.\\" In Westminster parliaments, the wording could be \\"There being no objection, leave is granted.\\" On the most routine matters, such as inserting an article into the Congressional Record in Congress, the chairperson may shorten this statement to four words: \\"Without objection, so ordered\\" or even to two words: \\"Without objection\\" (). Another example of this practice in the House of Representatives is when a series of votes has been interrupted by a speaker or other business. The chair will state, \\"Without objection, five minute voting will continue.\\" If no member objects, the motion is adopted. But if any member objects, the motion is not adopted and cannot be agreed to without a formal vote. Raising an objection does not necessarily imply that the objector disagrees with the proposal itself. They may simply believe that it would be better to take a formal vote. Sometimes unanimous consent can be assumed if the chair perceives that no one would raise an objection if he formally asked. For instance, if it is obvious that the members of an assembly are absorbed in listening to a speaker who has exceeded the time limits on debate, but is about to conclude, the chair may allow the speaker to continue without interruption. Objections are sometimes used as a delaying tactic. The objector may have no disagreement with the proposal at issue, but chooses to object in order to force a time-consuming formal vote, which may include a period of debate as well.  Consent agenda  Many deliberative assemblies (e.g. city councils) use a procedure known as the \\"consent agenda\\". Matters believed to be noncontroversial are placed on the consent agenda, and they are all adopted by a single motion. If any member objects to one or more items on the consent agenda, the items objected to are removed from the consent agenda and handled in the ordinary course.  Typical uses of unanimous consent  Unanimous consent is frequently used to approve the minutes. If no one has corrections to the minutes, they are approved without a formal vote by unanimous consent. In this special case of unanimous consent, the only way to object to the approval of the minutes is to offer a correction to it. In an election, if there is only one candidate and the rules do not require a ballot vote in that situation, the single candidate is declared elected by acclamation, or unanimous consent. In this special case of unanimous consent, the only way to object to the election of a candidate is to nominate and vote for someone else. A meeting could be adjourned by unanimous consent. If no one has any further business at the end of a meeting, the chair simply declares the meeting adjourned without a formal motion or a formal vote.  Leave of the house (or leave of the senate)  In parliaments under the Westminster system, leave of the house or leave of the senate is a similar concept to requiring unanimous consent. If a member asks for leave to be granted to do something that is different from the rules, a single objection can defeat the request.

During his career, he was considered one of the most demanded in his field. Gervacio has worked under numerous pseudonyms including: George Santos, Gerry Santos, Herb Bas, Bas Santos, and Bass Santos. He has earned numerous awards, including three Famas Awards for Kalibre 45 (1957), Cavalry Command (1963) and Scout Rangers (1964). He won Best Film Editing Awards in both the Metro Manila Film Festival for \\"Remembrance\\" and in the Quezon City Film Festival for \\"Alyas Bagsik\\".  Career  Santos began his professional career as an editor in 1954 at Premiere Productions where he was given the break to edit the film titled Conde de Monte Carlo starring Roegilio de la Rosa. He worked on Si Eva at si Adan directed by Gerry de Leon. As house Editors he edited an average of one feature film monthly, editing pictures directed by prominent movie directors including to name a few, Nemesio Caravana, Cesar Gallardo, Efren Reyes, Bert Avellana, Eddie Romero, Josefino Cenizal, others. In 1967, he left the studio and became employed by Tamaraw Studios, owned and operated by Albert Joseph and his brothers. The studio have editing and laboratory facilities which cater to independent film productions including Tagalog Ilang Ilang Productions, AM (Amalia Fuentes) Productions, JE (Joseph Estrada) Productions among others. As a freelancer, he worked in every studio facilities such as LVN Studios, Sampaguita Pictures, FIL-AM (Fernando Poe Productions) where other movie producers have their production filmed and processed for post- production. By this time, Santos had edited several hundred full-length Filipino movies. Having established a good refutation American producers who came to shoot their movies in the Philippines hired him to edit their film. It is at this time that he shifted his attention to editing American movies, mostly with Roger Corman who co-produce with Cirio Santiago Film Organization. (IMDB has a partial list of the several movies he had edited for them. He served as president of the Film Editors Guild of the Philippines from 1974 to 1983 and then again in 1984 to 1986 at the same times being a member of the board of governors of the Film Academy of the Philippines. In 1989, although he has an assignment with Cirio Santiago to edit 2 films, he, together with his family emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He planned to come back to the country to fulfill the assignments but for some reason he had not made it. He and his family members are now full-pledged Canadian citizens.  Present career  Santos is currently retired. He lives in Canada with his wife, five children, and five grandchildren. Circa 2012, Santos has been involved in the Toronto television show Fillipino, Eh! where he appeared in various comedy skits.

It is the only shrew native to Ireland. Active throughout the day and night, the Eurasian pygmy shrew lives in undergrowth and leaf litter and lives off small insects and invertebrates. It has an average weight of 4 grams and has one of the highest metabolic rates of any animal, meaning it must eat at regular intervals -- every two hours or so. The breeding season lasts from April through to August. Females usually produce between two and eight young per litter and care for the young in an underground nest. Since the gestation period is just over three weeks, they can have up to five litters in one year, though the life span of a pygmy shrew is a little over 15 months. In April 2008, the greater white-toothed shrew was discovered in Ireland. While the introduction of the species will possibly sustain threatened birds of prey, such as the barn owl, the nonnative mammal could threaten some of the smaller native species, such as the Eurasian pygmy shrew.

Testa made his reputation as a hitman for the Philadelphia family during a period of internal gang conflict. The son of former boss Philip, Testa was an emerging figure in the mob until he was killed on the orders of boss Nicky Scarfo Sr. Biography Born on March 31, 1956, in Southwest Philadelphia, Testa was the son of Alfia Arcidiacono (1926–1980) and Philip \\"Chicken Man\\" Testa (1924–1981), a member of the Philadelphia family that served under Angelo Bruno. In 1974 he graduated from Saint John Neumann High School and he attended Temple University, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for a year, and then went into the real estate business. Testa had one sister, Maria, who managed a Center City, Philadelphia nightclub and restaurant. In March 1980, longtime family boss Angelo Bruno was murdered and Testa's father became boss. The death of his father's predecessor, Angelo Bruno, triggered a violent civil war in the family between factions loyal to Harry Riccobene and Nicodemo Scarfo, who controlled the family's Atlantic City, New Jersey operations. On March 15, 1981, Testa's father returned to his home in South Philadelphia that was across the street from the scenic Stephen Girard Park. As he was opening the door to his twin home at 2117 Porter Street, a nail bomb exploded under his front porch.Capuzzo, Michael \\"The Murder Room: The Heirs of Sherlock Holmes Gather to Solve the World's Most Perplexing Cold Cases\\" p. 189. New York: Gotham Books. 2010 His death was allegedly ordered by his underboss and drug trafficker Peter Casella and capo Frank Narducci Sr., which later resulted in Narducci being gunned down and Casella being banished from the Mob and fleeing to Florida. Scarfo took over the crime family following Philip Testa's death, and he promoted Salvatore Merlino to underboss. On July 31, 1982, Salvatore Testa was wounded near his home in the Italian Market section by shotgun blasts fired from a speeding car. In 1984, Testa broke off his engagement to Merlino's daughter. Enraged, Merlino got permission from Scarfo to murder Testa, despite him being a loyal member of the crime family. However, Merlino developed a drinking problem, which caused Scarfo to demote Merlino and cut off ties with him. Testa allegedly sold an Atlantic City bar at twice the market value to Donald Trump in order for him to build the Trump Plaza (Atlantic City) in 1984. Death and aftermath In 1984, Scarfo ordered the death of Testa, one of his capos and top hitmen, as Testa's ambition and growing popularity made Scarfo feel threatened. On September 14, 1984, Testa was found shot to death at the side of a road in Gloucester Township, New Jersey. About 300 people attended Testa's funeral procession on September 20, 1984, at St. Paul's Catholic Church in Philadelphia's Italian Market section. He was interred alongside his father, Philip, and mother, Alfia, at the family plot at Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeadon, Pennsylvania. As a result of Salvatore Testa's murder, Scarfo gained a reputation for disloyalty, and several criminal organizations across the United States began to distrust him.

Beaver dam on Coyote Creek in San Jose November, 2018. History Coyote Creek was originally named Arroyo del Coyote by Padre Pedro Font when the de Anza Expedition reached it on Sunday, March 31, 1776. Watershed Coyote Creek aerial view from the south in San Jose, from south of Hellyer County Park up to Interstate 280 Paralleling Coyote Creek to the east is its tributary Thompson Creek, along San Felipe Road with Reid–Hillview Airport and Lake Cunningham at top, Yerba Buena Road at bottom. Although it is called a \\"creek\\", Coyote Creek is actually a river draining and running from the confluence of its East Fork and Middle Fork to southeast San Francisco Bay. The river's main source is on Mount Sizer near Henry W. Coe State Park and the surrounding hills in the Diablo Range, northeast of Morgan Hill, California. At the base of the Diablo Range, the creek is impounded by two dams, first Coyote Reservoir and then Anderson Lake. Nine major tributaries lie within the area that drains to these two reservoirs: Cañada de los Osos, Hunting Hollow, Dexter Canyon, and Larios Canyon Creeks drain to Coyote Reservoir; Otis Canyon, Packwood, San Felipe, Las Animas, and Shingle Valley Creeks drain to Anderson Lake. Coyote Reservoir Dam was built across the active 1000-ft wide trace of the Calaveras fault by the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) between 1934–36, storing of water. From Anderson Lake, Coyote Creek continues northwards from Morgan Hill through Coyote Valley, the narrowest point between the Diablo Range and the coastal Santa Cruz Mountains, where it picks up Fisher Creek before entering San Jose. As Coyote Creek forms the eastern boundary of downtown San Jose, it winds its way into North San Jose. There, Silver Creek (including its tributaries Miguelita Creek and Thompson Creek), Penitencia Creek, and Berryessa Creek are all tributaries. Coyote Creek then bypasses the Newby Island landfill and empties into the San Francisco Bay. There is a chain of parks along Coyote Creek called the Coyote Creek Park Chain, which contains the Coyote Creek Trail. The feasibility of a trail connecting the parks within this chain to Almaden Park was first examined in 1989.Feasibility Study for providing a trail between Alamden Park and the Coyote Creek Park Chain, Earth Metrics Incorporated, prepared for Parks and Recreation Department, City of San Jose, California, July 1989 The river is managed by the SCVWD. In 1983, torrential rains caused by el Niño resulted in significant flooding of Coyote Creek in the Alviso neighborhood. The SCVWD, with advice from Santa Clara Basin Watershed Management Initiative (WMI) stakeholders, produced a stream stewardship plan for the Coyote Creek watershed in 2002. The plan includes over sixty projects to benefit flood protection, habitat enhancement, parks, and trails. The Silver Creek Fault runs generally parallel to Coyote Creek. Risk of Anderson Dam failure from earthquakes Updated findings from an ongoing study of Anderson Dam were released in October, 2010, indicated that the dam could fail if a magnitude 7.25 earthquake occurred within 2 kilometers of the dam, potentially releasing a wall of water high into downtown Morgan Hill in 14 minutes, and deep into San Jose within three hours. In response SCVWD has lowered the water to 54 percent full, which is below the dam crest. According to the SCVWD, remediation of the problem will likely require lengthy construction that would take up to six years and cost as much as $100 million. Because Coyote Reservoir Dam was built right across the Calaveras fault and there is a substantial risk of a seismic-triggered landslide on the east side of the reservoir at the dam site, an earthquake could cause failure of this dam upstream of the Anderson Dam, and the release of water could increase risk of failure of the Anderson Dam. On February 24, 2020, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered that Anderson Lake should be drained due to earthquake risk. 2017 Coyote Creek flood Anderson Reservoir, above Morgan Hill and San Jose, California, near capacity, two weeks after its overflow flooded neighborhoods in San Jose in 2017 After unusually heavy rainfalls, on February 20 and 21, 2017, the Anderson Reservoir reached as high as 104 percent of capacity, creating a large flow over the spillway into Coyote Creek, which overflowed and flooded neighborhoods of San Jose along US Highway 101 between the reservoir and the south San Francisco Bay. The 2017 flood was the worst one since 1997. By 4 p.m. February 20, 2017, San Jose City opened an overnight shelter for residents who chose to voluntarily evacuate their homes in low-lying areas along Coyote Creek. Subsequent days, the city started issuing mandatory and advisory evacuation areas. On February 21, 2017, five people were rescued from the Coyote Creek floodwaters at Los Lagos Golf Course. The flood on that day forced the closure of US 101 in Morgan Hill. Twenty-eight horses were stranded at Cooksy Family Stables in South San Jose and at nearby Happy Hollow Park & Zoo in San Jose. Nearly 500 homes were evacuated at Senter Road and Phelan Avenue. The entire William Street park was flooded. A parking garage at San Jose International Airport was also flooded. About 14,000 people were forced out of their homes as a result of the flood. By February 23, 2017, nearly 4,000 people were still placed under evacuation orders. The creek reached a record height of . In the weeks following the flood, citizen anger and anguish about the emergency response to the flood led to disagreements between the City of San Jose and the SCVWD. At a hearing at City Hall on March 9, 2017, the City took some responsibility for giving late evacuation notices to residents but also blamed the water district for giving them flawed information. For example, although the district had estimated that the flows would have to exceed 7400 cubic feet per second (209.6 m3 per second) for flooding to occur, flows peaked only slightly higher, at 7428 cubic feet per second (210.3 m3 per second), and only well after flooding had already commenced; flooding had commenced at less than two thirds of the district's stated capacity. Later in the month, the two parties disagreed about whose responsibility it is to maintain and repair the creek. , the damage from the flood is estimated to cost more than $100 million to repair. Habitat and wildlife The tributary Lower Silver Creek where it comes from under McKee Road and King Road in San Jose Coyote Creek has historically, and still does support the most diverse fish fauna among the Santa Clara Valley Basin watersheds. It supports 10 to 11 native fish species out of the original 18. Species known to occur currently include Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata), steelhead/resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), California roach, Hitch (Lavinia exilicauda), Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidotus), Sacramento pikeminnow, Sacramento sucker, three-spined stickleback, prickly sculpin (Cottus asper), riffle sculpin (Cottus gulosus), staghorn sculpin, and tule perch (Hysterocarpus traskii). Three species, the thicktail chub, splittail, and Sacramento perch have been extirpated from the drainage; the thicktail chub is extinct. 1962 report indicated that Coyote Creek, from its mouth to the headwaters in Henry Coe State Park, was an historical migration route for steelhead trout. SCVWD studies have shown that Standish Dam and percolation ponds have posed barriers to outmigrating trout. Based on these results, the seasonal Standish Dam barrier has not been installed since 2000. The on- channel percolation ponds constructed on Coyote Creek severely degrade steelhead habitat by harboring non-native fish predators, such as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) which prey on salmonid fingerlings, and also by releasing warm water flows. Moving Ogier Ponds and Metcalf Percolation Ponds off-channel would significantly enhance rearing habitat for steelhead. In December 2017 Professor Jerry Smith of San Jose State University, announced that anadromous steelhead trout had been extirpated from Coyote Creek. These fish had spawned and reared in the perennial flows in the few miles below Anderson Dam since its construction. Smith's report noted that no young steelhead, known as smolts, had been able to outmigrate for several years because of lack of flows from dam releases in May, the month of outmigration, even in wet years such as 2017. Lack of outmigration coupled with immigration barriers such as the Singleton Road overcrossing, which acts as a permanent passage barrier to spawning runs in all but a handful of days even in wet years, led to the loss of the creek's reproducing steelhead trout population. The Chinook salmon run in Coyote Creek may be the most viable for restoration in the South Bay, since the breeding salmon in the Guadalupe River have severely declined subsequent to installation of extensive concrete channels in the river in downtown San Jose, California by the SCVWD. These are \\"fall run\\" fish primarily adapted to the Sacramento and San Joaquin River watersheds. Since Chinook salmon spawn in early winter and juveniles migrate to the ocean in their first spring, they are able to use habitats that turn very warm or have low water quality in summer. In 2012, the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan reported that Chinook salmon currently spawn in Coyote Creek as well as the Guadalupe River and its tributaries. Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were present in the Coyote Creek watershed until the 1950s, suggesting that some spawning and rearing habitat was located in the watershed downstream from Coyote Reservoir which was completed in 1936—blocking access to of upstream watershed. Historically, suitable habitat for coho salmon in the Coyote Creek watershed was likely restricted to the San Felipe Creek and Upper Penitencia Creek watersheds and possibly perennial reaches of Coyote Creek, and a few spring-fed tributaries upstream from Gilroy Hot Springs. Assuming the Coyote Percolation Reservoir was not a complete barrier to coho salmon; the construction of Anderson Dam in 1950 would have eliminated any coho salmon that occurred in the San Felipe Creek watershed that now flows into Anderson Lake. However, if the Coyote Creek Percolation Reservoir were a migration barrier, then only Upper Penitencia Creek would have provided suitable habitat for coho salmon after 1934. San Felipe Creek currently contains habitat potentially suitable to coho salmon with low stream temperatures related to cool groundwater discharges in the Calaveras Fault zone. During early June and late-July 1997, the senior author recorded water temperatures within the San Felipe Creek watershed within pools containing rainbow trout between and , respectively. Zones of groundwater discharge along the Calaveras Fault zone that traverses the watershed maintain cool summer water temperatures. Upper Penitencia Creek, which enters lower Coyote Creek near its mouth and drains the steep coastal hills to the east also may have contained suitable coho salmon habitat. A 1962 California Department of Fish and Wildlife report indicates that golden beaver (Castor canadensis subauratus) lived in Coyote Creek historically. This report is consistent with Alexander McLeod's report on the progress of the first Hudson's Bay Company fur brigade sent to California in 1829, \\"Beaver is become an article of traffic on the Coast as at the Mission of St. Joseph alone upwards of Fifteen hundred Beaver Skins were collected from the natives at a trifling value and sold to Ships at 3 Dollars\\". Physical proof of golden beaver in south San Francisco Bay tributaries is a Castor canadensis subauratus skull in the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History collected by zoologist James Graham Cooper in Santa Clara, California on Dec. 31, 1855. Beaver recolonized Coyote Creek in 2018 (see photo of beaver dam), apparently using the Bay to move from the Guadalupe River watershed. A 1995 study showed high levels of toxic substances in receiving waters and sediments along urban areas of the creek versus undeveloped areas. This correlates to the density of storm drains suggesting that the pollution is from urban run-off. The Friends of Coyote Creek community group merged with the South Bay Clean Creeks Coalition in 2018.

Fate unknown, presumably killed by Claude. Lionel: Murderous drug customer who buy drugs from Mike and his cousin Charlie. Described as having yellow and brown bloodshot eyes. Kills Charlie and Nana at the beginning of the book. Hunter is blamed for the murders. Agrees to sleep with Jessica in exchange for twelve. Shoots White Mike with Charlie's gun and is killed by Claude as he tries to flee. Molly: A friend of White Mike's who does not know he is a drug dealer. Very pure, never uses drugs or goes to parties. Killed by Claude. Timmy and Mark Rothko: Two wanna-be black boys who buy marijuana from White Mike. Speak in exaggerated hip-hop slang. Both killed by Claude. Charlie: White Mike's cousin who got him into drug dealing. Killed by Lionel. Plot summary Twelve is the story of 17-year-old White Mike, the privileged son of a restaurant tycoon. His mother succumbed to breast cancer several years before the novel began. White Mike is a drug dealer who has taken his senior year in high school off to sell marijuana to his wealthy peers. When he is not selling drugs he is reminiscing of his childhood and philosophizing about a world he feels he is not a part of. The novel takes place over a five-day period in December 1999, beginning on the night of the 27th and ending on New Year's Eve. It is told in a 3rd person narrative and follows not just White Mike but many other characters, but despite this White Mike is the central figure in the book. ;Part 1 -- December 27 The novel begins with White Mike thinking about his deceased mother and musing about the state of New York in the Winter. He then visits the rec center, where Hunter, a friend of his has gotten into a fight with a black basketball player named Nana. The fight ends with both covered in copious amounts of each other's blood. White Mike and Hunter head to a nearby Goody's, where they discuss college. White Mike then leaves to make a sale. Hunter then leaves and goes home, thinking about the fight with Nana while listening to James Taylor on his discman. At home he makes sporadic conversation with his father, who is quite wealthy and a borderline alcoholic. Hunter then leaves the apartment and goes for a walk. The narrative then shifts to Nana, who is going home to his apartment in the Harlem housing projects. Before he can get into his building he witnesses a drug deal between two shady characters, a pale white boy and a heavy black man. The deal then erupts into violence when the heavy man shoots the pale boy with a gun wrapped in a hand towel. Nana tries to escape but is killed as well by the heavy man, who pockets the pale boy's revolver before fleeing the scene. We then shift to Sara Ludlow, the \\"hottest girl in school\\" and her girlfriends as they head to a party. They discuss school and their friends. White Mike is at the party. He sells some pot to Chris, the boy throwing the party, but declines Chris's invitation to come in. After wondering how smart Sara Ludlow is, he leaves, musing about how rich everyone is. We then meet Chris, the boy throwing the party, a 17-year-old boy desperate to lose his virginity. There is an overview of the party and we then meet Jessica, a school mate of Sara and Chris who heads to the bathroom to do some cocaine. Instead of cocaine she does a drug given to her by a boy. The drug is called Twelve. She takes some and is overwhelmed by the high that follows. She compares it to the first time she read The Gettysburg Address before passing out. The narrative shifts to Claude, Chris's brother, and Tobias, a male model, taking a trip through China Town. They smoke some pot together and then buy bladed weapons at a shop. Claude takes home his weapons and arranges them in his closet, all in perfect order like some private shrine. ;Part 2 -- December 28 The corpses of Nana and the pale boy are found. After talking with some boys who witnessed the fight at the rec center, two detectives place Hunter under arrest because of the blood still on his clothes. Jessica wakes up and heads to the skating rink with some girlfriends. Once there, she accidentally injures a boy named Andrew by cutting his forehead with her skate. Andrew is taken to the hospital and the girls leave the rink. Jessica calls Chris and asks for White Mike's phone number, telling him that she wants more of the drug she had the party, Twelve. At the hospital, Andrew undergoes surgery and is placed in a room for an overnight stay. He is placed in the same room as Sean, the high school football star who happens to be Sara Ludlow's boyfriend. Sean was involved in a car accident. Sara arrives to visit him and strikes up a conversation with Andrew. Andrew loans her his Dave Matthews Band CD, thinking it will make a good excuse to see her again. Sara then goes to see Chris. She asks him to host another, bigger party on New Year's Eve, since his parents are out of town. Chris is apprehensive, but Sara tempts him with sexual favors so he gives in. White Mike meets Jessica with Lionel, a mysterious drug dealer who supplies Mike with Marijuana. Lionel sells the Twelve to Jessica, who asks for Lionel's beeper number in case she wants more; Lionel gives her the number. White Mike and Lionel then converse about Charlie, White Mike's cousin who got him into drug dealing and is away at College. It is revealed here that Lionel killed Charlie and Nana. He tells White Mike he has not seen Charlie, and departs. Tobias heads to a shoot at the modelling agency. There he meets Molly, a fellow model who he is interested in. He takes Molly to Chris and Claude's where he is keeping his flesh-eating piranhas. After showing her the fish, he invites her to the New Year's Eve party and she agrees. Hunter is placed under arrest for the murders of Nana and Charlie since the blood on his clothes is verified as Nana's. He finds he does not have an alibi. Chris and Claude go to a cocktail party hosted by their aunt. Chris converses with a wannabe-author friend of his aunt's about The Beatles and Eminem. After the party Claude returns to China Town with Tobias and illegally buys an Uzi submachine gun from one of the shops. ;Part 3 -- December 29 Chris is having a boxing lesson when Sara shows up, requesting money for some Twelve which she will give to Jessica. Chris reluctantly gives her the money. Molly visits White Mike, who is a good friend of hers even though she is unaware of his \\"profession\\". She tells him about Tobias and the party. White Mike gently tries to dissuade her from going. Andrew is bored so he goes for a walk and ends up in Carl Schurz park where he meets and eccentric old man named Sven. He plays a game of chess with Sven, who beats him. Andrew feels he is being insulted by Sven and tries to leave, but Sven insists on taking him to a nearby pub for a drink. He does. At the bar, Andrew and Sven drink Scotch and Sodas and discuss school and Sven's old life as a merchant sailor. Feeling weirded out, Andrew leaves. White Mike is walking home and sees Captain, a homeless bodybuilding black man, injuring himself by hitting a brick wall and calls an ambulance. ;Part 4 -- December 30 That morning, Andrew calls Sara under the guise of getting his CD back. She invites him to Chris's party and asks him to bring weed. Andrew does not smoke pot but decides to score some anyway. We are then introduced to Timmy and Mark Rothko, two unlikely wanna-be \\"cool kids\\" who get their kicks stealing CDs, smoking weed and speaking in an exaggerated hip-hop vernacular. They contact White Mike with the intent of buying some weed. White Mike has a phone conversation with an old friend of his and Hunter's, Warren, and then decides to take a train ride down to Coney Island. The perspective shifts to Sean, who has to go to the hospital for a check-up on his broken arm. He takes a taxi and is annoyed by the driver. White Mike goes to Coney Island and observes people. Back on the train he gets the call from Timmy and Mark Rothko. Jessica wakes up and watches the talk shows. She enjoys watching the \\"dregs of humanity\\" on television and holds a fake talk show with her stuffed animals in which she comments on a fictional school massacre. Here we are given the impression that Jessica may not be all there. Timmy and Mark Rothko stop to buy cigarette usings a fake I.D. It fails and they threaten the store clerk, who in turn pulls an empty revolver on them. They leave all too quickly. Jessica has lunch with her mother, who advises she visits a psychiatrist. She reluctantly agrees and wonders what she will tell her psychiatrist. White Mike sells some weed to Timmy and Mark Rothko, who both irritate and amuse him with their lifestyle. In jail, Hunter finally contacts his father through Andrew's father. Hunter tells his father he is frightened. Hunter's father remembers an incident that happened when he was in school, when a boy died at a drunken fireside party. White Mike meets Andrew at the amphitheatre and sells him weed. White Mike is curious as to why Andrew is buying it. Andrew tells him it is for a girl. ;Part 5 -- New Year's Eve Andrew wakes up and decides to get a haircut. He does, then at home decides he looks bad. He decides to go to the party and resolves to get himself drunk. Chris goes out and buys toiletries and condoms, thinking that tonight will be the night that he loses his virginity. He goes home and throws out his collection of pornography. Timmy and Mark Rothko call White Mike for more weed. They follow him to his house, much to his annoyance. He gives them their weed and they talk about birds. Mark Rothko and Timmy then go to the supermarket and smash a container of Marshmallow fluff. White Mike receives a call from his dad telling him Charlie is dead. White Mike breaks down and wonders who could have done it. Jessica prepares for the party and to score more Twelve. At the party, Jessica gives her cell phone to a girl who beeps White Mike for weed. White Mike rushes over. Andrew and Molly meet in the kitchen and grow closer, deciding to head out for pizza when Lionel arrives. Lionel and Jessica go upstairs and she realises she does not have enough for a bag. She offers to have sex with Lionel in exchange. White Mike arrives at the party and in a fit of rage trashes the house stereo. He punches Chris when Chris attempts to kick him out. He bursts in on Lionel and Jessica, who are having sex. Lionel pulls Charlie's revolver, which he took from the murder scene, on White Mike. White Mike realises Lionel killed Charlie and attacks him, only to be shot. The gunshot causes Claude to snap, and he leaves his room armed with his submachine gun and sword. He goes on a rampage, killing many of the partygoers including Mark Rothko, Timmy, Andrew and Molly. After charging through the house, he steps outside and opens fire on the police, who fatally shoot him on the spot. An afterword by White Mike explains that he underwent surgery for his wound and survived. It also states that Hunter was cleared of all charges after the bullets from Lionel's gun were examined. He also explains that he is now studying in Paris and that he likes it better than New York. =Inscription= After the title page is the inscription, \\"Dedicated to my father.\\" The next page reads, \\"Can we please all stand and have a moment of silence for those students who died?

Located on the banks of the Bhogavo River, around 3 km from Surendranagar and 111 km from Ahmedabad, Wadhwan is a known location for its old world royal charm and serene space with a life and culture of its own. It was historically the capital of Wadhwan State. Demographics Flag of Wadhwan India census, Wadhwan city had a population of 61,739. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Wadhwan city has an average literacy rate of 71%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 78%, and female literacy is 63%. In Wadhwan city, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. Geography It is located on the bank of the dry Bhogavo River. History The name \\"Wadhwan\\" is said to derive from \\"Vardhmānpur\\", after Vardhamana, also known as Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankar of Jainism. According to legend, the site of Wadhwan was originally a place called \\"Astigram\\", or \\"the village of bones\\", due to the predations of a man-eating yaksha named Shulpani, who lived in a cave on the bank of the Bhogavo river half a mile east of the present town. However, Mahavira visited the town and converted Shulpani, and the relieved inhabitants renamed the town Vardhmanpur in his honor. A temple dedicated to Mahavira now stands on the site said to have been Shulpani's home. Another legendary account holds that, around 295 CE, Wadhwan was ruled by the Vala dynasty king Ebhal, remembered in oral tradition for defeating an Irani force of 200,000 men. A copper-plate inscription dated to samvat 639 (717 CE) records Wadhwan (as Vardhmanpur) as being ruled by a Raja Dharnivaraha of the Chapa dynasty; Dharnivaraha is described as subservient to one Mahipal Dev, whose identity is uncertain. Dharnivaraha's ancestry is also given: he appears to have succeeded his brother Dhruvabhta as king; their father was Pulkeshi, who was the grandson of Vikramark, founder of the dynasty, via Vikramark's son Adraka. The later Solanki dynasty of Patan made Wadhwan a fortified post on their military highway from Viramgam to Junagadh and Somnath; Wadhwan lay between Jhinjhuvada and Sayla on this road. Later still, Wadhwan was the seat of a branch of the Vaghela dynasty; after that, it came under Muslim rule. From the time of Ahmad Shah I of the Gujarat Sultanate, Wadhwan was the site of a strongly fortified thana to secure control over the region. The city's Pada mosque was constructed during this period; a Persian inscription formerly in the mosque (but later kept in the Darbar enclosure which was later converted into a granary dated to 1439 CE records it as having been built by one Malik Muhammad b. Malik Musa during the reign of Ahmad Shah. Another inscription, this one in Old Gujarati and dated to samvat 1613 (1556 CE, during the reign of Ahmad Shah II), records the local Kotia and Talavia Kolis as being landholding pasaitas responsible for the maintenance of the forts (kot) and water tanks (talavi) near their lands. = Wadhwan State = The Thakore of Wadhwan During the British Raj, Wadhwan State was one of several princely states governed by the Jhala Rajputs. It was classified as a 9-gun salute state. Vadhwan rulers belonged to the Jhala Rajput clans and had good administrative and culturally inclined society. To provide sufficient protection to their clan and the people, the town of Vadhwan was fortified and gates were erected at most places to provide safety. Some of these gates and the fortified walls are still found in the city, although city has grown beyond these walls. Vadhwan was the centre of the princely state by the same name, which in earlier days was known as Vardhamanpuri, the name being derived from the great Jain Thirthankaras, Bhagwan Vardhaman. The prime ministers of this princely state belonged to the Rawal family who were given the title of Dewan Bahadur. Under their rule, a number of important structures were constructed, mostly during the era of 18th and 19th century. Vadhwan is considered as an important centre for Jains and is renowned as one of the fortified towns of Gujarat. Formerly known as Vardhamanpuri, the town is believed to have footprints of Lord Mahavir. The Raj Mahal and Hawa Mahal were constructed here by the erstwhile rulers of the region. The Raj Mahal was the residence of His Highness Balsinhji in the 19th century, replete with exotic gardens, cricket pitches, fountains, tennis courts and lily ponds. The Raj Mahal is now functioning as a heritage hotel. Several members of the Thakar family served as Dewans (Prime Ministers) of the princely state, most prominent amongst them being Vishwanath Thakar and Khodidas Thakar in the 19th century. = Historical buildings = Hawa Mahal, \\"the wind palace\\" was built during the era of Jhala rulers. Even though it was an ambitious project with ultimate craftsmanship, the work was left incomplete. The part which is incomplete is outside the actual fort and is in different stages of construction along with the study of architectural designs, which were stopped midway. These give a glimpse into the style of architecture used by the artisans in erecting Hawa Mahal. In the present day also, many of the Sompura artisans whose community built Hawa mahal are seen involved in carvings and cutting of sculptures for various Hindu and Jain temple projects. [Sompura Salat community was one of the Brahmin communities in Gujarat who were master artisans. They built famous Somnath Temple. In recent years, these artisans have been called upon for restoration work of various temples in Gujarat as well as in other parts of India, and also building new temples.] Vadwala Temple here is some 450 years old. 11th century Gangva Kund at Dedadara village is believed to have been constructed during the Chalukya period. The popular ancient Gangavav step-well is believed to have been constructed in Vikram Samvat in 1969. There is Lakhavav also. Madhavav is popular stepwell for its historical significance. It is believed that the son and daughter-in- law of King Sarang Dev sacrificed their lives here for the natives of the region. The Automobile Library, Wagheshwari Devi Temple and Swami Narayan Temple are some of the prominent attractions located in the vicinity of Wadhwan.  Education  C. U. Shah University is a private university located in Wadhwan city. It is run by Vardhman Bharti Trust and named after Chimanlal Ujamshibhai Shah. It had been created by the state of Gujarat under the Private University Amendment Bill in 2013. Dajiraj HighSchool is old Education institute in WADHWAN State. That's are establish to since in 1885.

The Porto Polytechnic developed as a metropolitan institution with schools in Porto, Matosinhos, Póvoa de Varzim, Vila do Conde and Felgueiras. Porto Polytechnic was created in Porto in 1985 and its objective was to relaunch the polytechnic studies in Portugal. The Polytechnic started with two schools: the School of Education and the School of Music. In 1988, the ISCAP (Institute of Accountancy and Administration) and one year later the ISEP (Institute of Engineering), two schools founded in the 19th century were integrated. Today, it is the largest polytechnic institute of Portugal,IPP Self- Evaluation Report. (October 2006). European University Association Programme. p.12 with seven schools and 15,729 students enrolled for the 2007-2008 school-year. The Porto Polytechnic is organized as a confederation of polytechnic schools. In the school year of 2003/2004 the Polytechnic had 15,000 students, a third of them in its major college, the ISEP. It also had about 1000 teachers. 7000 students competed to enter in that year and 2000 entered. P.PORTO rank fourth among first-choice higher education institutions, and fifth in number of students.  History  In 1852, the Porto Industrial School, later called the Porto Commercial and Industrial Institute, is established. In 1918, the Industrial Institute and the Commercial Institute separate formally. Their names, as we know them today, are created only 60 years later. In 1975, the Porto Industrial Institute changes its name to Porto School of Engineering and is integrated in the university education system. In 1976, the same happens with the Commercial Institute: it changes its name to Porto Accounting and Business School and is also integrated in the university education system. In 1985, the Polytechnic Institute of Porto is established, integrating the newly-created Porto School of Education and Porto School of Music. The latter changed its name in 1994 to School of Music and the Performing Arts, so as to integrate other forms of art, besides music. In 1988, both the Accounting and Business School and the School of Engineering are integrated in the polytechnic subsystem. Two years later, in 1990, the School of Management and Industrial Studies is created with two buildings, one in Póvoa de Varzim and one in Vila do Conde. It is only in 2001 that this school unites under a new single building, located between the municipalities of Vila do Conde and Póvoa de Varzim. In 1999, the School of Management and Technology is established in Felgueiras and, in 2004, the School of Healthcare Technology of Porto is integrated.

Bézoutian may also refer to the determinant of this matrix, which is equal to the resultant of the two polynomials. Bézout matrices are sometimes used to test the stability of a given polynomial. Definition Let f(z) and g(z) be two complex polynomials of degree at most n, :f(z)=\\\\sum_{i=0}^n u_i z^i,\\\\quad\\\\quad g(z)=\\\\sum_{i=0}^n v_i z^i. (Note that any coefficient u_i or v_i could be zero.) The Bézout matrix of order n associated with the polynomials f and g is :B_n(f,g)=\\\\left(b_{ij}\\\\right)_{i,j=0,\\\\dots,n-1} where the entries b_{ij} result from the identity : \\\\frac{f(x)g(y)-f(y)g(x)}{x-y} =\\\\sum_{i,j=0}^{n-1} b_{ij}\\\\,x^{i}\\\\,y^{j}. It is in \\\\Complex^{n\\\\times n} and the entries of that matrix are such that if we let m_{ij}=\\\\min\\\\\\\\{i,n-1-j\\\\\\\\} for each i, j = 0, \\\\dots, n-1, then: :b_{ij}=\\\\sum_{k=0}^{m_{ij}}(u_{j+k+1}v_{i-k}-u_{i-k}v_{j+k+1}). To each Bézout matrix, one can associate the following bilinear form, called the Bézoutian: :\\\\operatorname{Bez}:\\\\Complex^n\\\\times\\\\Complex^n\\\\to \\\\Complex:(x,y)\\\\mapsto \\\\operatorname{Bez}(x,y)=x^*B_n(f,g)y. Examples * For n = 3, we have for any polynomials f and g of degree (at most) 3: ::B_3(f,g)=\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix}u_1v_0-u_0 v_1 & u_2 v_0-u_0 v_2 & u_3 v_0-u_0 v_3u_2 v_0-u_0 v_2 & u_2v_1-u_1v_2+u_3v_0-u_0v_3 & u_3 v_1-u_1v_3u_3v_0-u_0v_3 & u_3v_1-u_1v_3 & u_3v_2-u_2v_3\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]. * Let f(x)=3x^3-x and g(x)=5x^2+1 be two polynomials. Then: ::B_4(f,g)=\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix}-1 & 0 & 3 & 00 &8 &0 &0 3&0&15&00&0&0&0\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]. The last row and column are all zero as f and g have degree strictly less than n (equal 4). The other zero entries are because for each i = 0, \\\\dots, n, either u_i or v_i is zero. Properties * B_n(f,g) is symmetric (as a matrix); * B_n(f,g)=-B_n(g,f); * B_n(f,f)=0; * B_n(f,g) is bilinear in (f,g); * B_n(f,g) is in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times n} if f and g have real coefficients; * B_n(f,g) is nonsingular with n=\\\\max(\\\\deg(f),\\\\deg(g)) if and only if f and g have no common roots. * B_n(f,g) with n=\\\\max(\\\\deg(f),\\\\deg(g)) has determinant which is the resultant of f and g. Applications An important application of Bézout matrices can be found in control theory. To see this, let f(z) be a complex polynomial of degree n and denote by q and p the real polynomials such that f(iy) = q(y) + ip(y) (where y is real). We also note r for the rank and σ for the signature of B_n(p,q). Then, we have the following statements: * f(z) has n − r roots in common with its conjugate; * the left r roots of f(z) are located in such a way that: ** (r + σ)/2 of them lie in the open left half- plane, and ** (r − σ)/2 lie in the open right half-plane; * f is Hurwitz stable if and only if B_n(p,q) is positive definite. The third statement gives a necessary and sufficient condition concerning stability. Besides, the first statement exhibits some similarities with a result concerning Sylvester matrices while the second one can be related to Routh–Hurwitz theorem.

It originally aired on April 7, 1999 and is the 32nd episode overall. This episode features Jennifer Aniston providing the voice for Miss Stevens. The episode criticizes the American Movement to Save the Rain Forest and mocks Costa Rica. The episode's title includes a shm- reduplication. This episode was inspired by Trey Parker's personal intense distaste towards rainforests and Costa Rica. Parker explains on the DVD commentary that, at the suggestion of Flea, Parker and his girlfriend went to Costa Rica and hated the country, and that everything Cartman says about the rainforests and Costa Rica during the episode is how he (Parker) personally feels.South Park: Season 3 DVD Boxset Episode Commentary The episode is also filled with famous environmentalist clichés, such as, \\"We must take only photos and leave only footprints\\", \\"It's more afraid of us than we are of it\\", and \\"We have to respect mother nature and she will respect us\\". Plot Miss Stevens (voiced by Jennifer Aniston), the leader of the \\"Getting Gay With Kids\\" environmentalist choir tour, visits South Park Elementary, trying to recruit more kids to the group. The boys get themselves into trouble after calling the choir names and belittling their cause. They are sent to the office, where Mr. Mackey punishes the boys by forcing them to join the choir, since he happens to be on the board of directors. Kenny is the only one who is happy about it, since he has developed a crush on a girl in the choir named Kelly. The choir goes to San José, Costa Rica, to tour, where Miss Stevens tells Cartman that she plans on changing his views on third-world countries. Upon arriving, Cartman immediately starts to make trouble, including yelling at Costa Ricans, directing everyone's attention to prostitutes and commenting that San Jose \\"smells like ass.\\" The children get to meet the Costa Rican President and do a preview dance routine for some citizens of San Jose (with a pre-recorded song for the kids to lip-sync to), but Miss Stevens is dismayed by Kyle's lack of coordination. Cartman offers the opinion that Kyle cannot dance because he is Jewish, and \\"Jewish people don't have any rhythm.\\" Kyle angrily denies this as a stereotype, but Stan wonders if it is true, making Kyle fear that it is. The children then take a tour to see the \\"wonders\\" of the rainforest. Cartman starts hitting the animals that live in their natural habitats, irritating Miss Stevens. Eventually, their tour guide is killed, eaten, and excreted by a coral snake, all surprisingly in the space of less than a minute, leaving Miss Stevens and the children on their own in the jungle. Cartman hits the snake on the head, which causes it to temporarily chase him, likely to try and do the same thing to him as it did to their tour guide. They run into a group of guerrilla rebels and try to convince them to help them get back to San José, but the leader merely criticizes and insults them. When government troops arrive, the choir has to run away. After more time spent wandering lost, Cartman announces that he is leaving the \\"hippie\\" group. Only moments later, he finds a friendly crew of white construction workers tearing down trees and tells them all about the group getting lost, though not before asking for food. Meanwhile, Kelly takes Kenny to one side and admits her feelings for him, but tries to stop herself from going too far, which annoys Kenny, as she lives on the other side of the USA and cannot manage a long-distance relationship. Back in San José, the concert is about an hour away from starting, and the President stalls for time by telling poorly- thought-out \\"Polak\\" jokes. Miss Stevens and the remaining children are captured by a tribe of indigenous people called the Yanagapa (a phonetic parody of the South American indigenous demonym Yanomama), who offer up Miss Stevens, now dressed in a Stanford-looking cheerleading outfit, as an offering to a giant indigenous man, with Kelly voicing that this offering is more than likely that of a sexual nature. At this point, Miss Stevens changes her mind and decides that the rainforest is not such a good place, after all. She screams profanities about everything rainforest-related, much to the shock of the indigenous inhabitants (and to the boys' annoyance over how long it had taken for her to \\"get it\\"). Just then, Cartman and the white construction workers arrive to destroy the village, kill the indigenous people, and save the children. Just as Kelly is making arrangements with Kenny over maintaining a long-distance relationship, he is immediately struck and nearly killed by a bolt of lightning. Afterwards, Kyle and Stan say their usual lines, but Kelly asks them who \\"they\\" are, since Kenny was struck by lightning, not people. Kyle and Stan are unable to answer her, claiming: \\"You know, They. They're bastards.\\" Frustrated, Kelly asks them to help Kenny, but the two are fulfilling their usual role on the show, outraging Kelly even more. She then desperately attempts CPR and successfully saves Kenny, to the amazement of Stan and Kyle. With this result, Kenny has successfully survived an entire episode for the second time (the first time being \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\"). When the group escapes the forest, Miss Stevens and the children are so happy to leave the jungle that they change their tune: different lyrics are applied to the original song, which now rebukes the rainforest rather than praises it. It meets with a positive response from the audience, as if they were still singing rainforest activism. The episode ends with a message telling people about the dangers of the rainforest and to help stop it. Controversy Despite the episode airing in 1999 in the U.S. and a few years later in Latin America, the episode caused some controversy in February 2007 over the comments that Cartman made about Costa Rica saying that the town of San Jose \\"smells like ass\\" and the way the creators show the country full of \\"prostitutes, shantytowns, and trash.\\" The Costa Rican Government was reportedly \\"not amused\\" with this episode.

It is long and weighs , and has velvety dark brown fur with a pale underside. Juvenile shrews have lighter fur until their first moult. The common shrew has small eyes, a pointed, mobile snout and red-tipped teeth. It has a life span of approximately 14 months. Shrews are active day and night, taking short periods of rest between relatively long bursts of activity.  Territory  Common shrews are found throughout the woodlands, grasslands, and hedgelands of Britain, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe. Each shrew establishes a home range of 370 to 630 m² (440 to 750 yd²). Males often extend the boundaries during the breeding season to find females. Shrews are extremely territorial and will aggressively defend their home ranges from other shrews. They make their nests underground or under dense vegetation.  Diet  The common shrew's carnivorous and insectivorous diet consists of insects, slugs, spiders, worms, amphibians and small rodents. Shrews need to consume 200 to 300% of their body weight in food each day in order to survive. A shrew must eat every 2 to 3 hours to achieve this goal. A shrew will starve if it goes without food for more than a few hours. They do not hibernate in the winter because their bodies are too small to store sufficient fat reserves and as they have a short fasting duration. Common shrews have evolved adaptations to survive through the winter. Their skulls shrink by nearly 20% and their brains get smaller by as much as 30%. Their other organs also lose mass and their spines get shorter. As a result, total body mass drops by about 18%. When spring returns, they grow until they reach roughly their original size. Scientists believe that dropping temperatures trigger their bodies to breakdown bones and tissues and absorb them. As temperatures start to rise with the onset of spring, their bodies start to rebuild the lost bones and tissues. This significantly reduces their food requirements and increases their chances of survival in the winter. Additionally, common shrews exhibit three distinct seasonal phenotypes; however, these phenotypes have the same relative oxygen consumption despite varying temperatures. Shrews have poor eyesight and instead use their excellent senses of smell and hearing to find food.  Breeding  The common shrew breeding season lasts from April to September, but peaks during the summer months. After a gestation period of 24 to 25 days, a female gives birth to a litter of five to seven babies. A female rears two to four litters each year. The young are weaned and independent within 22 to 25 days. Young shrews often form a caravan behind their mother, each carrying the tail of its sibling in front with its mouth.  Chromosomal polymorphism  The chromosome number (karyotype) of Sorex araneus varies widely, with a number of distinct \\"chromosomal races\\" being present over the species' range. One such race was described in 2002 as a new species, S. antinorii. This an example of chromosomal polymorphism (chromosomal variability as a result of chromosome fusions or disassociations).Polymorphism: when two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same interbreeding population of a species. Ford E.B. 1975. Ecological genetics, 4th ed.White M.J.D. 1973. The chromosomes. Chapman & Hall, London. p169 These karotypes have been known to naturally hybridize, such as in the Petchora race and the Naryan-Mar variant in Northeastern Russia.  Echolocation  A study by Nanjing Normal University in 2019 found that Sorex araneus is capable of echolocation via high-frequency tittering and close-range spatial orientation. Comparison of genes involved in hearing between cats, bottlenose dolphins and Sorex araneus suggests that this is a result of convergent evolution.  Protection and population  Common & Eurasian pygmy shrews (genus Sorex), size comparison The common shrew is not an endangered species, but in Great Britain it, like other shrews, is protected from certain methods of killing by the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981.Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 S11, Sch 6 In Britain, shrews can be found at densities of up to one per 200 m² (240 yd²) in woodlands. The main predators of shrews are owls, cats, weasels, snakes, stoats, and red foxes.

In the book the author describes her interpretation of the waning of the Eastern Christendom under the Islamic empire's conquests. Thesis and structure Bat Yeor described her book as \\"In this study, I tried to analyze the numerous processes that had transformed rich, powerful Christian civilizations into Islamic lands and their long-term effects, which had reduced native Christian majorities into scattered small religious minorities, now slowly disappearing. This complex Islamization process of Christian lands and civilizations on both shores of the Mediterranean—and in Iraq and Armenia—I have called: the process of \\"dhimmitude\\" and the civilization of those peoples who underwent such transformation, I have named the civilization of \\"dhimmitude\\". The book consists of two parts, an analysis, which aims to paint a broad picture of the conversion of the Near East to Islam, and an appendix containing selected primary sources. The emphasis of the analysis lies on the near past, especially the 19th century. The appendix contains translations of Islamic and non-Islamic sources from the Middle Ages and Western sources of newer date. Reviews =Academic= Professor of Middle East studies at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mordechai Nisan writes that Bat Ye'or's \\"exceptionally relevant scholarly study ... amasses compelling evidence and employs powerful argumentation to expose and explain dhimmitude—the author's neologism.\\" She challenges traditional notions of Islamic tolerance and the future of minorities within Islamic lands. German orientalist Holger Preissler, in a review positive to the ambition and subject of the book, writes that the book curiously does not cite readily available high quality sources, and that Ye'Or overplays the role of jihad in modern times. He also points out that in criticising frequent one-sided and apologetic uses of Islamic sources, Ye'Or fails to avoid going to the opposite extreme, particularly in the documentation part of the book. Sidney H. Griffith writes that Bat Yeor raised important inter-religious problem but the book itself is problematic as Griffith points out : \\"They [the documents used as sources] are presented out of context with no analysis or explanation... The trouble with The Decline of Eastern Christianity is that in spite of the gathering of an enormous amount of historical material, and although she has raised an issue that well deserves study, Bat Ye'or has written a polemical tract, not responsible historical analysis.Meanwhile, the historical question remains to be answered: why is it that from the mid-7th century to the 20th century the number of Christians in the Islamic world has dwindled from a majority in many areas of the Middle East to virtual insignificance in terms of demography? Is it really due to the net effects of the disabilities prescribed by Islamic law for the dhimmil Or are there other factors?\\"Griffith, Sidney H., The Decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude, Seventh-Twentieth Century, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 30, No. 4. (Nov., 1998), pp. 619-621, . In a review of The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude the American historian Robert Brenton Betts commented that the book dealt with Judaism at least as much as with Christianity, that the title was misleading and the central premise flawed. He said: \\"The general tone of the book is strident and anti-Muslim. This is coupled with selective scholarship designed to pick out the worst examples of anti-Christian behavior by Muslim governments, usually in time of war and threats to their own destruction (as in the case of the Turk-perpetrated Armenian genocide of 1915). Add to this the attempt to demonize the so-called Islamic threat to Western civilization and the end-product is generally unedifying and frequently irritating.\\"Robert Brenton Betts, \\"The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude\\".Middle East Policy 5 (3) (September 1997), pp. 200-203 =Other= The Catholic convert and minister Richard John Neuhaus wrote that the book \\"tells the story straight, thus countering the Islamophile histories that have dominated Western thought for so long\\".Richard John Neuhaus First Things (October 1997).

About half the book is given to a telling of the story, and the second half to a fascinating collection of documentary evidence from the beginning of Islam to the present ..Bat Ye'or persuasively demonstrates, is a radical distortion of what happened. Islam's spectacular spread was brought about by brutal military conquest, rapine, spoliation, and slavery, joined to a regime of \\"dhimmitude\\" that was based on deep contempt for the subject infidels, including the Peoples of the Book. \\"  See also  * Criticism of Islam References External links *Introduction to The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam *Islam Review: Eastern Christians Torn Asunder Category:History books about Christianity Category:1996 non- fiction books Category:History books about Islam Category:History of Eastern Christianity Category:Persecution of Christians by Muslims ","title":"The Decline of Eastern Christianity"},{"id":"2082379","text":"Tao Yang is a Chinese-American computer scientist.

Unlike general obligation bonds, only the revenues specified in the legal contract between the bond holder and bond issuer are required to be used for repayment of the principal and interest of the bonds; other revenues (notably tax revenues) and the general credit of the issuing agency are not so encumbered. Because the pledge of security is not as great as that of general obligation bonds, revenue bonds may carry a slightly higher interest rate than G.O. bonds; however, they are usually considered the second-most secure type of municipal bonds. Purpose Revenue bonds may be issued to construct or expand upon various revenue-generating entities, including: * Water and Wastewater (Sewer) utilities * Toll roads and bridges (see toll revenue bond) * Airports, seaports, and other transportation hubs * Power plants and electrical generation facilities * Prisons Generally, any government agency or fund that is run like a business, generating operating revenues and expenses (sometimes known as an enterprise fund), can issue revenue bonds. An agency that provides a free service, such as a school, can not do so, as their only revenue is tax dollars. Law in the United States The Supreme Court decision of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. of 1895 initiated a wave or series of innovations for the financial services community in both tax- treatment and regulation from government. This specific case, according to a leading investment bank's research, resulted in the \\"intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine,\\" ultimately leading to \\"tax-free status.\\" The interest on municipal bonds is generally excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes (however, capital gains or accruing market discount are not tax exempt); for these purposes, accruing original issue discount is also treated as \\"interest\\" which is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Some municipal bonds are called \\"specified private activity bonds\\" and are preference items under the alternative minimum tax. Additionally, corporate taxpayers may need to include interest on otherwise tax exempt municipal bonds in a calculation base for purposes of the alternative minimum tax and other special taxes. For taxpayers who purchase municipal bonds issued in the same state in which they reside, interest payments are generally exempt from state and local tax also. States generally tax interest on municipal bonds issued in other states. There is considerable variability by state, however. For example, in Maryland there is also a specific exemption of capital gain on Maryland-issued municipal bonds. In contrast, Minnesota does not provide for an exemption. The differential treatment of different state's interest was considered in the case Kentucky v. Davis, 553 U.S. 328 (2008). Municipal Bonds may be issued in one of two forms: (a) revenue bond, or (b) general obligation (GO) bond. Revenue bonds may be issued by an agency, commission, or authority created by legislation in order to construct a \\"facility,\\" such as a toll bridge; turnpike; hospital; university dormitory; water; sewer, utilities and electric districts; or ports. The fees, taxes, or tolls charged for use of the facility ultimately pay off the debt. Many governments with the power to tax also issue revenue bonds, but restrict the debt service funds to only those funds from the governmental enterprise that generates these revenues. The issuing government does not pledge its own credit to pay the bonds. When a municipality assumes liability for the debt service, if the income from the project is insufficient, it is considered to be double-barreled. In this case however, they are more like GO bonds, except that, for bankruptcy and security purposes, they have the benefit of the additional security provided by the pledged revenues. An example of double- barreled bonds is water and sewer revenue bonds issued on behalf of a water and sewer enterprise system. Revenue bonds are most often issued to finance a revenue-generating public works project such as, bridges, tunnels, sewer systems, education (e.g. college dorms and/or student loans). In the case of education or school systems, bonds issued for colleges and universities are generally backed by income or other progressive taxes. General obligation bonds may be backed by a variety of credits depending on the state and local law; those credits include taxes on local property (ad valorem), regressive taxes and/or all other sources of revenue to the municipality. As a general rule, revenue bonds are backed by the revenue generated by the municipal facility funded by the bond issue. A feasibility study should be conducted to compare one project's IRR (internal rate of return, or hurdle rate) to another proposed project, as it is most important to ensure the success of the municipality. For instance, local government and port authorities can propose construction for a given neighborhood, based on projects that have been successful previously, or it can create a nonprofit authority to issue revenue bonds to build a school district, for example. In recent legislation, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (Securities Acts Amendments of 1975), and now FINRA (the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) as of July 30, 2007, the industry overall has consolidated not only in sheer number but by undoing previous legislation such as the Securities Act of 1933. Municipal bonds traditionally were exempt from the filing requirements of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, however, like all other securities they are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and once again the newly formed FINRA. Some examples of Revenue Bonds include: § IDRs and IDBs (Industrial Development Revenue Bonds) or, after the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, PABs (Private Activity Bonds) § Lease rental bonds § Special Assessment Bonds (or Special District Bonds or, in California, Mello-Roos Bonds) § Housing Authority Bonds As a revenue bond is not backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing government, it does not require voter approval. As of July 1, 1983, all municipal bonds must be registered. Two other important pieces of legislation are the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the 39 General Regulations that govern the SRO (self-regulatory organization) of the MSRB. The MSRB, as mentioned above, governs the issuance and trade of municipal securities both general obligation and revenue bonds.

He was born in Dalkeith, Scotland. He emigrated to Philadelphia in 1769, where he published the Pennsylvania Magazine, or American Monthly Museum in 1775–76. Starting in Philadelphia as a bookseller in 1769 and 1771, Aitken started publication of The Pennsylvania Magazine in 1775, continuing through 1776. He also printed copies of the New Testament in 1777, 1778, 1779, and 1781. He died in Philadelphia in 1802. Aitken Bible of 1782 The Aitken Bible of 1782 was reviewed, approved and authorized by the Congress of the Confederation. The Bible was reviewed first for accuracy by the Congressional Chaplains White and Duffield and they reported on its accuracy. Then the Journals of Congress for September 1782 records on page 469, \\"Resolved. That the United States in Congress assembled highly approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitkin, as subservient to the interest of religion as well as an influence of the progress of arts in this country and being satisfied from the above report (by the congressional chaplains), they recommend this edition of the bible to the inhabitants of the United States and hereby authorize him to publish this recommendation.\\" (Spelling has been modernized).Journals of Congress, pages 468-469. September 1782. Found at the Library of Congress at https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/vc006473.jpg In 1781 Aitken undertook to print the first complete English Bible produced in America and sought the official sanction of Congress for his edition. Congress passed a resolution officially authorizing the edition in September 1782. Known as the “Aitken Bible,” this was the first and only edition of the Bible ever authorized by Congress. As Aitken reported to George Washington, the venture was a financial failure. Background and the need for an American printed Bible The war with Britain had cut off the supply of Bibles, and, on September 11, 1777, the Continental Congress reviewed a committee report, informing them that a locally produced bible may not be a viable option, due to the risk and cost of procuring the materials necessary. The committee noted, \\"...the use of the Bible is so universal, and its importance so great, that the committee refer the above to the consideration of Congress, and if Congress shall not think it expedient to order the importation of types and paper, your committee recommend that Congress will order the Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 Bibles from Holland, Scotland, or elsewhere, into the different ports of the states in the Union.\\" Congress favored the idea of importing 20,000 Bibles, in order to address the short supply. Library of Congress Papers of the Continental Congress, No. 28, folio 203 On Thursday, September 12, 1782, Congress reviewed a report dated September 1, 1782, from their Congressional committee, and signed by the committee Chairman, James Duane. The committee had been, \\"…referred a memorial of Robert Aitkin, dated January 21st, 1781, respecting an edition of the holy scriptures.\\" This committee had, from time to time, checked on the progress of Aitken's work, and their report stated, \\"Our knowledge of your piety and public spirit leads us without apology to recommend to your particular attention the edition of the holy scriptures publishing by Mr. Aitkin.\\" Library of Congress Journals of Congress, Thursday, September 12, 1782, page 468 Next Congress reviewed a report dated September 10, 1782, from the committee, and signed by the Chaplains of the United States in Congress assembled, William White and George Duffield. This report stated they had reviewed the printing and it was found to be, \\"…with as few grammatical and typographical errors as could be expected in an undertaking of such magnitude.\\" Library of Congress Journals of Congress, Thursday, September 12, 1782, page 469 The outcome is listed as, \\"Resolved.

Since the war was coming to a close and Congress had already ordered the discharge of two-thirds of the army, the suggestion came too late. However, Washington said, \\"It would have pleased me well, if Congress had been pleased to make such an important present to the brave fellows who have done so much for the security of their country's rights and establishment.\\" From George Washington to John Rodgers, 11 June 1783  See also  *Jane Aitken *Isaac Collins References *Journals of Congress, September 1782, pages 468-469.

Its stories revolved around Bobino (a kind gentleman played by Guy Sanche) and his sister Bobinette (a puppet voiced by Paule Bayard and later by Christine Lamer). The cast is complemented by a number of other characters which never appear on screen but who interact with the cast by visual or audible cues. History Bobino was created in 1957 as the host and presenter of animated shorts by Guy Sanche, the star of the show. At first, the show was unscripted, and Sanche created a number of imaginary characters to interact with and play against such as Camério, the personification of the camera, who could answer by nodding or shaking its \\"head\\" or Gustave, the noisy and distracting ghost created by accident when a stage operator dropped a set of keys on the set during the (then) live filming. In 1959, Michel Cailloux joined the production team to write new scenarios which had been written entirely by Sanche until that point. Cailloux introduced a number of new characters over the years, including Bobinette the boisterous little sister of Bobino and Giovanni a friend of Bobinette introduced in 1980. Bobinette was originally handled and voiced by Paule Bayard, who became gravely ill in 1973. Christine Lamer took the character over starting at the end of the 1972-1973 season until the show's end. Radio-Canada ended the show in 1985 causing a flurry of protest and petitions to keep it on the air. However, Sanche's health was deteriorating and was no longer able to continue hosting the show. Sanche died three years later of cancer. Format The show centered on the interaction between Bobino and his sister, who would either come up with elaborate schemes for pranks to play on her brother (who would often get the last laugh by coming up with a prank of his own and turning the tables); or with Bobinette getting into trouble of her own making from which Bobino would rescue her, not without passing the opportunity for a lesson or moral. The live action segments were cut in three acts, separated by two animated shorts. Music theme The music used for the generic of Bobino is named Double March and is credited to composer Dwight Barker. Dwight Barker is in fact the penname of the compositor duo formed by Tommy Reilly and James Moody. Adaptations Bobino et Botinette were adapted into a comic strip by Norbert Fersen.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/fersen_norbert.htm References External links *Bobino entry on IMDB Category:Television series produced in Quebec Category:Ici Radio-Canada Télé original programming Category:1957 Canadian television series debuts Category:1985 Canadian television series endings Category:Television shows adapted into comics Category:Canadian television shows featuring puppetry Category:Black-and-white Canadian television shows Category:1950s Canadian children's television series Category:1960s Canadian children's television series Category:1970s Canadian children's television series Category:1980s Canadian children's television series ","title":"Bobino (TV series)"},{"id":"2082436","text":"Opry Mills is a super-regional shopping mall in Nashville, Tennessee owned by Simon Property Group, formerly by its initial owners Mills Corporation and Gaylord Entertainment. It opened in 2000 on the former site of the Opryland USA theme park. The mall is adjacent to the Grand Ole Opry House and the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center. Description Prior to its temporary 2010–2012 closure, Opry Mills was a single level mall that contained over 200 stores including Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World, Blacklion (now Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store), Bed Bath & Beyond, Forever 21, Gap Factory Store, Gibson Showcase (now H&M;), IMAX, Off 5th Saks Fifth Avenue, Barnes & Noble Booksellers (now Madame Tussauds), Nike Factory Store, Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse, Old Navy Outlet Store, Regal Cinemas, Sun and Ski Sports and VF Outlet. There is also a large food court that contains Which Wich, Chili's, T.G.I. Friday's, Burger King, and Villa Pizza. Johnny Rockets, Tony Roma's, Rainforest Cafe, Dave & Buster's, Aquarium Restaurant, Claim Jumper, Moe's Southwest Grill and Romano's Macaroni Grill restaurants are located inside and outside the food court. Opry Mills has since reopened on March 29, 2012 after repairs. The General Jackson showboat, which operates on the Cumberland River, is docked just outside Opry Mills. Closure due to flooding Flood waters from the 2010 Tennessee floods in early May reportedly reached as high as 10 feet inside the mall, and forced the closure of the facility temporarily. The entire property was remediated. In September 2010, restoration work was halted while litigation over insurance claims played out in court, and many of the mall's retailers sought locations elsewhere in the area, either permanently or until the mall is restored and reopened. The initial reopening date was set for August 2011, but that self-imposed deadline was not met due to the litigation.Snyder, Eric. \\"Opry Mills mall won't reopen for at least a year, owner says\\", \\"Nashville Business Journal\\", September 16, 2010 There was speculation that Simon Malls may not reopen the mall at all, due to Simon Malls' choice to stop renovations to the mall during litigation. Simon Malls denied that it had plans to close the mall permanently. On April 12, 2011, mall officials announced that a financing deal had been reached to resume reconstruction of Opry Mills, and the mall reopened on March 29, 2012, after two years of repairs, with some of the anchor retailers opening sooner.http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110412/BUSINESS01/110412007/Opry- Mills-plans-reopen-spring-2012?odyssey=tabtopnewstextFRONTPAGE The property was given a facelift during the remediation, and featured a new logo upon its reopening. The mall owners had been awarded $200 million in insurance coverage from the flood but in 2018 the Tennessee Supreme Court let stand a lower court's ruling that stripped $150 million of coverage as the mall had been built in a known flood zone.

The film is directed by Larry Cohen, his final film before his death in 2019. The film details the deteriorating state of an impoverished Gary neighborhood terrorized by a street gang called the Rebels. When the gang murders a local boy, it prompts the emergence of several individuals who grew up in the neighborhood: the original members of the Rebels. Plot The movie opens to a narration detailing the poor economic state of a gang-ridden Gary. The narrator explains to the audience of how the city came into such a state. After the opening narrative, the scene switches to the base of operations for the Rebels, a local street gang, and a one-on- one basketball game between a Rebel gang member and a local boy named Kenny Thompson. Kenny humiliates the Rebel by winning and taking the gambled winnings for his own. After he leaves, Spyro, the current co-leader of the Rebels (opposite Damien) is under the impression that Kenny's skills are something more than \\"something he picked up.\\" He instructs his lieutenant, Kayo, to exact retribution on Kenny for being hustled. While Kenny and his friend Marcus are relaxing at a diner, Kenny decides to call his girlfriend. He enters a phone booth to make the call, but is subsequently shot by Kayo in a drive-by shooting. His mother, Laurie Thompson, alarmed by the gunshots, steps outside her home to discover her son murdered. The owners of the grocery store, Marvin Bookman and Gracie Bookman, two well-respected members of the community by both the Rebels and local citizens, feels that justice should be brought to Kenny's murderer and discloses the license plate number of the shooter's vehicle. When the Rebels discover this, Spyro orders Kayo to dispose of the vehicle. Kayo and the Rebels then proceed to confront Marvin about his assistance to the investigators of Kenny's death. Marvin argues that Kenny was a good person and did not deserve to be shot. The co-leaders of the Rebels describe how they respected the Bookmans' store and, while others around it were robbed and ransacked, their store was left alone. The fact that Marvin would \\"sell them out\\" expresses a high amount of disrespect to the Rebels, who then immediately seek revenge on Marvin. Eventually, Kayo and Bobby, with a group of fellow Rebels, attacks the grocery store, resulting in the near-fatal shooting of Marvin by Bobby. The attack on Marvin's life prompts his son, pro football coach and ex-Rebel John Bookman, to return to the impoverished Gary neighborhood to find Bobby the shooter. After seeing his father, John goes to save his father's shop and kicked all the Rebels fellows out of there. Then he goes to a local barbershop, where Kayo eventually turns up. Trouble immediately brews, and John and the gang members fight. John has the upper hand, but is overpowered. Jake Trevor, another original Rebel, enters the fray and saves John. After the fight, the two converse, and it is revealed that Jake is here to bury his illegitimate son, Kenny Thompson. Jake goes to visit \\"Slick\\",who reveals to Jake that his son was killed because he hustled the Rebels. Jake is astounded and enraged that his son was killed over money. The next day, John and Jake attend Kenny's funeral, where a distraught Laurie Thompson is reunited with her ex-husband. While talking, Laurie implores Jake to reconsider seeking vengeance upon his son's murderers, expressing her disdain by stating that he always wishes to resolve such issues by fighting, which \\"only makes things worse\\". John tells Jake that he has a meeting with the Rebels at the church that makes Jake and Laurie disappointed at him. Jake confronts Spyro at the basketball court about Kenny Thompson. After failed treaty negotiations at the church and the rising of neighborhood gang violence, the other gangs, The Diablos and The Rangers, have a meeting with Spyro, Damien and The Rebels about Kenny Thompson. At the Rebels party, John and Jake drove Spyro and Damien's car into The Diablo's territory and shoot at them to set The Rebels up to break the truce. The Rebels set the community houses on fire as retaliation with molotov cocktails. All of the original Rebels - John Bookman, Laurie, Jake, Slick and Bubba - with the help of Kenny's friend Marcus, decide to take justice into their own hands and attack the Rebels. They devise a plan to \\"lose\\" a trunk of weapons to the Rebels. When the Rebels tried to use said weapons, the guns malfunctioned and \\"exploded\\" in their faces, stunning many Rebels. In another area, Rebels are attempting to escape the battle, but are stopped by a group of community members, armed with bats and other improvised weapons. Eventually, Spyro and Damien fear they may lose the fight, and escape to the old steel mill. Jake and John follow. After an intense hand-to-hand fight between Jake and Spyro, Spyro is killed. After Spyro is taken down by Jake, the leader of a rival gang The Diablos, Blood, along with a few cohorts, shoots a battered Damien; the leadership of the Rebels is destroyed.

The light is just outside the entrance to Biddeford Pool and the end of the Saco River. The lighthouse is a conical white tower of granite rubble. The light itself sits above mean high water. Its automated beacon alternates between green and white every 10 seconds. Wood Island Light is Maine's second-oldest lighthouse (after Portland Head Light) and the nation's eleventh-oldest. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Wood Island Light Station on January 21, 1988, reference number 87002274. The United States Coast Guard maintains the active beacon of the lighthouse, while The Friends of Wood Island Light, a non-profit organization, has assisted the Coast Guard by maintaining and restoring parts of the lighthouse and keepers dwellings. History Wood Island Light was established in 1808 under the orders of President Thomas Jefferson. The original tower was an octagonal wooden structure. After it rotted, a granite tower was erected to replace it in 1839. In 1858, the new tower was renovated to allow the installation of a 4th-order Fresnel lens. The current keepers dwellings were also built then. In the 1960s, the original lantern room was removed and an aerobeacon was installed. This was deemed unsightly by locals and when the lighthouse was automated in 1986, a new lantern room was fabricated and installed on the lighthouse along with a VRB-25 beacon, then the latest technology. In 2013, the VRB-25 was replaced by a VLB-44, an LED beacon with a service life of ten years. Legends and lore Wood Island Light in 1910 Eben Emerson served as Lightkeeper from 1861 to 1865. On March 16, 1865, he saved the crew of the British brig Edyth Anne from drowning in a heavy storm near the lighthouse; for this action he was commended by the Canadian government and rewarded with a pair of binoculars. Thomas Henry Orcutt, a former sea captain and previous keeper at Saddleback Ledge Light served as keeper of Wood Island Light for 19 years (1886–1905). His dog, Sailor, became famous for ringing the station's fog bell to greet passing ships by taking the bell cord in mouth and pulling it with his teeth. In the 1890s Wood Island Light and Wood Island were host to a grisly murder-suicide. A local squatter and part-time lobsterman was living on the west end of the island. The squatter had been involved in an earlier altercation on the mainland and was approached by a sheriff's deputy in his squatter shack on the island. The squatter murdered the sheriff's deputy. Realizing what he had done he attempted to turn himself in to lighthouse keeper Thomas Orcutt who, in fear, turned him away. The squatter returned to his shack and committed suicide. Legend has it that the ghost of the murdered deputy still haunts the lighthouse and island.http://hauntedlights.com/haunted4.html  Keepers  *Benjamin Cole (1808–1809) *Philip Goldthwaite (1809–1832) *Tristam Goldthwaite (1832–1833) *Abraham Norwood (1833–1841) *John Adams (1841-unknown) *Stephen D.

To reach the best viewing spot proceed beyond SR-208's southern terminus along Lester B Orcutt Bl. There is an entrance to an Audubon trail on the left side of the road. Follow this path to the ocean. Wood Island Light is across the channel. Friends of Wood Island Lighthouse runs seasonal tours out to the island and lighthouse from Biddeford Pool.http://www.woodislandlighthouse.org/xTour%20Schedule/index.html Wildlife The island supports a small population of deer who swim the half mile to and from Biddeford Pool. When visiting the island it is a rare treat to spot them. The best viewing can often be in winter from the East Point Sanctuary in Biddeford Pool. In winter it is not uncommon to spot snowy owls on the island. Rafts of eiders, scoters and loons are present in the winter. Brants and cormorants arrive in early spring.

Some of the U.K.'s music festivals are world-renowned and have been held for many years including the world's largest greenfield festival, Glastonbury, which has been held since the 1970s. History of music festivals in the UK Isle of Wight Festival 1969 Large-scale modern music festivals began in the 1960s with festivals such as the Isle of Wight Festival and following the success of Woodstock in the United States and free festivals. Some began as jazz festivals - Reading Festival began as the National Jazz and Blues Festival in the 1960s and the first Glastonbury Festival was the 1970 Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival. In the 21st century the number of festivals has grown significantly, particularly with the emergence of smaller-scale \\"boutique\\" festivals. However, in 2011 and 2012, several festivals were cancelled at short notice - some due to weather conditions and some due to poor sales - prompting fears that the festival market is saturated. In 2020 the number of UK festivals was approximately 241.

It was built by the Knights Templar during the Crusades upon prior fortifications. Located on the middle hill of Safita's three hills, it offers a commanding view of the surrounding countryside, and was a major part of the network of Crusader fortifications in the area. From the roof, a view ranging see from the Mediterranean Sea to the snow-covered mountains of Lebanon, and County of Tripoli, is offered. From Chastel Blanc it would have been possible to see the Templar strongholds at Tartus and Ruad Island to the northwest, Chastel Rouge on the coastline to the southwest, Akkar to the south, and Krak des Chevaliers (the headquarters of the Syrian Knights Hospitallers) to the southeast. History The region was initially controlled by the Crusaders by 1110, and was mentioned the first time in an Arab chronicle in 1112. The Knights Templar built a dungeon after 1117, then they possessed the tower by 1152. Later on, the tower was attacked by Nur ad- Din in 1167, to be recaptured by the Templars in the same year, and was rebuilt after the 1170 earthquake, then in 1188 after Saladin's invasion, and after the 1202 earthquake. The tower was eventually captured and destroyed by Baibars in 1271. The tower served both as a chapel and a fortress, with thick walls constructed of massive and carefully fitted limestone blocks. The ground floor still contains a chapel, dedicated to St. Michael and used by the Greek Orthodox community of Safita. The second floor, which can be reached by a flight of partially destroyed stairs, served as a dormitory, and contains many small angled windows that were used by archers to defend the tower. Cut into the rock below the tower is a water cistern and a former weapons cache, essential elements in case of siege. From the other fortifications of the castle, only a portal at to the east of the keep can still be seen today. During the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, efforts were made to restore the tower, causing great discomfort to the villagers that lived very close to it. In 1946, when the castle's keep threatened to collapse, architect Pierre Coupel undertook an intensive programme of repairs. Structure The structure base dates back to the Phoenician era. However, the tower visible today is the remaining keep of the original castle. It has a height of , a width of , and a length of . A large bell is on the western wall, and its sound can be heard up to from Safita. The castle had to be restored in 1170 and 1202 following damages due to earthquakes. The keep in its current shape probably dates from the reconstruction after 1202.

He won the gold medal in the 3-mile team race and a silver in the steeplechase. The son of a Glasgow doctor, Robertson was educated at Kelvinside Academy, Glasgow, before moving to King's School, Peterborough at the age of 14. A brilliant all-round sportsman, he initially concentrated on cycling and only took up serious athletics at the age of 25, after a cycling injury. In 1906, he joined Birchfield Harriers. In March 1908 he won both the English and International Cross-Country Championships and a second-place finish in the 4 mile race at the AAA championship earned him a place at the Olympics. Robertson won easily in the first round of the 3200 metres steeplechase, finishing in 11:10.0. In the final, he trailed for most of the race. At the bell, he passed one of the two then-leaders, American John Eisele. Robertson was not quite able to catch the other leader, however, and trailed fellow Briton Arthur Russell by two yards at the finish. His final time was 10:48.4. At the same Olympics he won gold as a member of the 3-man 3 mile team race; the first Olympic gold won by a Scottish man and the first by a Birchfield athlete. He also participated in the five miles event and finished fifth. His brother David was a member of the British cycling team at the same olympics. On 13 September 1908 Robertson set a world record at 15:01.2 over 5,000 metres, running on a concrete cycle track in Stockholm. He retired from athletics after 1909 season and returned to cycling. Later, together with his brother, he ran a sports shop in Peterborough, and then passed it over to his son. Robertsone was posthumously inducted into the Scottish Sporting Hall of Fame in 2004. In January 2010, a new J D Wetherspoon pub in Perry Barr, Birmingham (close to Perry Barr Stadium, the former home of Birchfield Harriers) was named 'The Arthur Robertson' in his honour.

Its stories revolved around Verbo, a genie with magical power who was trying to recapture Centour (another genie who had escaped from the same land as Verbo). The show's main purpose was language acquisition, which was conveyed by the way Verbo would do magic: when he needed to perform a trick, he would ask his talisman (named \\"Memo\\") for a formula (always in the form of \\"it is a [subject], it is an [object], it is the [subject] of the [object]\\".) He would then close his eyes and repeat, asking the children at home to do the same. Centour on his part would perform magic by reciting similar formulas while shaking his magic wristband (which looked like a gaudy wristwatch). Verbo's constant companion was Picot Cotton, a young human male whose family was often the target of Centour's tricks.

He is one of the earliest Minamoto of historical note for his military exploits, and is known for quelling the bandits of Ōeyama. His loyal service earned him the governorships of Izu Province, Kozuke and a number of others in turn, as well as a number of other high government positions. Yorimitsu served as commander of a regiment of the Imperial Guard, and as a secretary in the Ministry of War. When his father Minamoto no Mitsunaka died, he inherited Settsu Province. Yorimitsu featured in a number of legends and tales, including the legend of Kintarō (Golden Boy a.k.a. Sakata no Kintoki), the legend of Shuten Dōji, and the legend of Tsuchigumo. Raiko is usually accompanied by his four legendary retainers, known as the Shitennō (The Four Heavenly Kings). They were Watanabe no Tsuna, Sakata no Kintoki, Urabe no Suetake, and Usui Sadamitsu. The Karatsu Kunchi festival in Karatsu City, Saga Prefecture, features a large float inspired by the helmet of Minamoto, being partially devoured by the oni Shuten Douji. Poetry Raiko wrote a renga with his wife, which appears in the Kin'yō Wakashū (nos.703-704): tade karu fune no suguru narikeri asa madaki kararo no oto no kikoyuru wa This translates as: a boat harvesting smartweed is passing by I thought I heard someone rowing smartly before dawn Popular Games and other works A female version of Yorimitsu appears in the mobile game Fate/Grand Order under the name Minamoto no Raikō. In Grand Order, Raikō and Ushi Gozen are both the same person, which is the explanation to why Raikō's gender is female. The main character; Raikoh Minamoto in the 2003 Xbox game Otogi: Myth of Demons, and its sequel Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors were loosely based on Minamoto no Yorimitsu (Otogi, Otogi 2) and The Four Guardian Kings (Otogi 2). The 2005 anime: Otogi Zoshi was also based loosely on Minamoto no Yorimitsu and his retainers. Raikou's fictional descendant, the also named Raikou Minamoto, is the main antagonist in both the manga and anime versions of Tactics. The original Raikou himself later appears in the form of flashbacks. A female version of Raiko appears in the 2004 New Getter Robo OVA series, fighting Oni with swords made of Getter Alloy. Minamoto also appears on the game Onmyoji, as an ambitious onmyoji, who hated ayakashi unlike the main character, Seimei. A version of the character appears in the 2011 Legend of the Millennium Dragon animated movie as a bodyguard to the time travelling student, Jun Tendo. Aside from these, Minamoto also appears in the manga series, Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, acting as the ancestor of the fictional exorcist character, Kou Minamoto, who was said to have been from the clan of the one who defeated Shuten Douji, one of the 3 Great Evil Youkai of Japan. Minamoto no Yorimitsu appears as a female yokai hunter in Nioh 2.

Walker Art Gallery Warning notice in the Walker Art Gallery during the show. The main show was in a large gallery at the Walker which normally houses works from the contemporary collection. The paintings were hung in a manner akin to the \\"salon\\" style, using the whole height of the wall. \\"Founder and featured artists\\" were each given their own space, while representative works from other UK and international artists were grouped accordingly. There was also a free-standing display of work which satirised the Tate Gallery and the Turner Prize. The Gallery posted a notice: :VISITOR NOTICE: THE STUCKISTS PUNK VICTORIAN :Stuckist artists believe in \\"honest and uncensored expression\\". Their wide range of subject matter includes themes of a sexual and violent nature. Some of the images in this exhibition may not be suitable for children. The show was extended from two to five months and the Walker called it \\"a really, really popular show and very successful.\\" Lady Lever Art Gallery The Lady Lever Art Gallery: paintings by Charles Thomson and (bottom right) Paul Harvey. A separate smaller show at the Lady Lever Art Gallery concentrated on the theme of \\"Art and Artists\\", including Stuckist interpretations of past work by artists such as Thomas Gainsborough, Frans Hals and Georges Seurat. The gallery also staged the first national exhibition by the Stuckist Photographers. Book A 144-page book was published by National Museums Liverpool to accompany the show with 150 colour illustrations, including work by all the artists, as well as photographs showing the history of the group. A photograph from 1987 shows some of the group members in an earlier form as The Medway Poets, at which time Tracey Emin was associated with them. Other photographs are of demonstrations outside the Turner Prize, two artists (Ella Guru and Sexton Ming) getting married in drag, and Stella Vine in the Vote Stuckist show in 2001. The book also includes two Stuckist manifestos, biographies of the artists, a section on Stuckist photographers, and two essays, \\"A Stuckist on Stuckism\\" by group co- founder, Charles Thomson and \\"Manifestos From the Edge and Beyond\\" by art historian Paul O'Keefe.

The image on the cover is a painting by Paul Harvey (acrylic on canvas, 212.5 × 75.5 cm), and was originally intended to accompany a previous show, the Stuckists Real Turner Prize Show 2003, when the placard held by the main figure read \\"SEROTA NEEDS A GOOD SPANKING\\".Milner, Frank ed. The Stuckists Punk Victorian, p.74, National Museums Liverpool, 2004. Due to an argument between Harvey and another artist, Gina Bold, the painting was not used and the show was cancelled.

A final section puts the group in context in a wider historical view with a proposition that the development of Modernism has been a \\"story of fragmentation\\" and that it is necessary to provide a holistic approach. A passage by Eamon Everall is quoted to explain Stuckist art: =Manifestos From the Edge= Paul O'Keefe's essay, Manifestos from the Edge and Beyond, is in three sections. The first treats the history of Modernism in Britain and the scorn that greeted the 1910 Post- impressionist exhibition. He describes the emergence of the homegrown radical movement, the Vorticists and how they clashed on one occasion, using brass knuckledusters, with rival avant-garde group the Italian Futurists. He includes Royal Academy President, Alfred Munnings', notorious 1949 speech, wanting to kick Picasso. He traces the evolution of radicalism into the new establishment, setting the scene for the Stuckist challenge to it.Milner, Frank, ed. The Stuckists Punk Victorian, pp.32-48, National Museums Liverpool 2004, . Charles Thomson. Is My Shoe Art? The second section is an analysis of a BBC2 Newsnight programme on 19 October 1999 hosted by Jeremy Paxman with Charles Thomson attacking that year's Turner Prize and artist Brad Lochore defending it. Thomson was displaying Stuckist paintings, while Lochore had brought along a plastic detergent bottle on a cardboard plinth. At one stage Lochore states, \\"if people say it's art, it's art\\". Paxman asks, \\"So you can say anything is art?\\" and Lochore replies, \\"You could say everything is art...\\" At this point Thomson, off-screen, can be heard to say, \\"Is my shoe art?\\" while at the same time his shoe appears in front of Lochore, who observes, \\"If you say it is. I have to judge it on those terms.\\" Thomson's response is, \\"I've never heard anything so ludicrous in my life before.\\" Part three describes the Stuckists' line of argument as \\"devastating in its capacity to demolish the pretensions of Conceptualism\\" and cites Damien Hirst's observation that \\"The best spot painting you can have by me is one painted by Rachel\\" (one of Hirst's assistants). O'Keefe's conclusion remains undecided as to \\"whether the Momart warehouse blaze indeed represents the funeral pyre of BritArt\\" and as to the future of Stuckism's role \\"from its outpost on the edge\\". Daily Mail Jane Kelly. If We Could Undo Psychosis 2. Daily Mail feature writer Jane Kelly, who is also a Stuckist artist, was sacked by the paper after exhibiting her painting If We Could Undo Psychosis 2 in the show. The painting shows a family group of mother and two children with child-killer Myra Hindley substituted for the father and holding a teddy bear. Thomson said, \\"It is not glorifying Myra Hindley, it's called psychosis--can anyone ever be healed is the question posed by this painting.\\" Kelly's sacking was reported on the front page of The Guardian, which described how the Daily Mail had welcomed a previous work by Kelly showing London Mayor Ken Livingstone in the context of the 1944 Stauffenberg plot against Hitler, and commented: :\\"Stuckism, the art movement founded by Tracey Emin's former boyfriend to oppose the pretensions of Britart, claims to advocate 'honest, uncensored expression'. Unfortunately, the Daily Mail does not appear to share those values\\". The Daily Mail's managing editor, Lawrence Sear, who dismissed Kelly, described as \\"unmitigated rubbish\\" the claim that the loss of her job was related to her artwork and that \\"the departure of Jane Kelly is a matter only for her and the newspaper.\\" Reaction There was a very diverse reaction to the show. Adrian Searle, art critic of The Guardian called it \\"dreadful\\" and Tate Chairman, Paul Myners denounced it as \\"a travesty\\". \\"Young British Artist\\" Gavin Turk advised in a BBC interview that people should try to see the show.Sumpter, Helen. \\"Liverpool Biennial 04\\", BBC (NB editorial, not member, content), 24 September 2004.

It runs for in a general north–south direction and connects the cities of Menominee, Escanaba, and Negaunee. The southern section of M-35 in Menominee and Delta counties carries two additional designations; M-35 forms a segment of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour, and it is the UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail, which is a part of what is now called the Pure Michigan Byways Program. Along the southern section, the highway is the closest trunkline to the Green Bay, a section of Lake Michigan. The northern section of the highway turns inland through sylvan areas of the UP, connecting rural portions of Delta and Marquette counties. M-35 is an original state trunkline that was first signposted in 1919, that was intended to run from Menominee in the south to near Big Bay in the north, before it was to turn toward L'Anse to end at Ontonagon. However, the section through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette and Baraga counties was never built. Automobile pioneer Henry Ford helped halt this construction to gain favor with and membership into the exclusive Huron Mountain Club. Some discontinuous sections were later ceded to local control. The northern segment of the route between Ontonagon and Baraga was retained as a discontinuous segment of the highway; this northern segment was later redesignated as another state trunkline. The northern end was later rerouted out of the City of Negaunee into Negaunee Township to avoid mining activity near Palmer.  Route description  M-35 is primarily a two-lane roadway, with the exception of the nearly section between Escanaba and Gladstone; this section is a four-lane divided highway that runs concurrently with US Highway 2/US Highway 41 (US 2/US 41). M-35 is also listed on the National Highway System along the US 2/US 41 concurrency. The southern terminus is in Menominee. From there, M-35 runs northeasterly to the Escanaba area before turning northwesterly to its northern terminus outside of Negaunee in Negaunee Township. = Menominee to Gladstone = G-12 in Menominee County The southern terminus of M-35 is at the corner of 10th Street (US 41) and North Shore Drive north of downtown Menominee. It is a Y-shaped intersection near John Henes Park. This park sits on of land, and it was donated to the City of Menominee by German-American brewer John O. Henes in 1907. M-35 leads northeast from the intersection before turning north to head out of town. The highway runs northeasterly following the shoreline of the Green Bay, toward Escanaba. M-35 between Menominee and Gladstone forms part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour and comprises a section of the UP Hidden Coast Michigan Recreational Heritage Route, one of the Pure Michigan Byways. At the Menominee–Delta county line, M-35 passes from the Central to the Eastern Time Zone. After entering the south side of Escanaba, M-35 runs into town on Lake Shore Drive, passing to the south and east of the Delta County Airport before turning onto Lincoln Road. Just west of downtown, US 2/US 41 join M-35 at the intersection of Ludington Street and Lincoln Road. Ludington and Lincoln form the east–west and north–south axes respectively of the Escanaba street numbering grid. From these two streets, the east–west avenues and north–south streets are numbered in a grid in the City of Escanaba. US 2/US 41 enter Escanaba from the west along Ludington Street, turning north along Lincoln Road, joining M-35. Here, M-35 joins the National Highway System, which is a road system important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. From Escanaba, M-35 runs concurrently with US 2 and US 41 to Gladstone, where M-35 logs its highest average annual daily traffic (AADT) counts. The 2012 AADT figures show that an average of 14,744 vehicles use the highway per day on a segment in north Escanaba. Between the two cities, US 2/US 41/M-35 crosses the Escanaba River near the mouth just south of a paper mill.. North of the Escanaba, the highway follows the shoreline of Little Bay de Noc to Gladstone. M-35 separates from US 2/US 41 at an intersection with 4th Avenue North in Gladstone. This also marks the location where the National Highway System, Lake Michigan Circle Tour and Pure Michigan Byway designations end on M-35. = Gladstone to Negaunee = Waste rock piles from the Empire Mine along M-35 southbound approaching Palmeralt=A roadway leading away into the distance before curving in front of a large pile of waste rock M-35 turns northwesterly in Gladstone through northern Delta County and southern Marquette County and crosses the Days River in Brampton. From Perkins north, M-35 runs parallel to the Lake Superior & Ishpeming rail line between the iron mines of Marquette County and Escanaba. The station of Maple Ridge was located in the community of Rock along this line. M-35 crosses into Marquette County in the unincorporated location of McFarland and crosses the rail line before reaching the Little Lake in the community of the same name. The highway runs east–west through Little Lake to Gwinn. Built as a company town by the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, Gwinn is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"Gwinn Model Town Historic District, Forsyth Township, Marquette County, Michigan\\". M-35 follows Stephenson Avenue through the neighborhood of New Swanzy westward to the community of Gwinn. Inside Gwinn, the highway follows Pine Street northwest, passing through the downtown and into residential areas along Pine and Iron streets. M-35 runs northwest of Gwinn to Palmer along the outskirts of Cleveland-Cliffs' Empire Mine, where large piles of waste rock from the mining operations tower over the roadway. According to the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), the segment through Palmer logged the highway's lowest AADT, only 487 vehicles per day, in 2012. North of Palmer, M-35 runs past Goose Lake to end in Negaunee Township. The northern terminus is east of Negaunee, just east of the former Marquette County Airport and the studios of WLUC-TV on US 41/M-28.  History  alt=A map of northern Marquette and Baraga counties in Michigan's Upper Peninsula showing US 41/M-28 running through the central part of the counties. M-35 extends north into the Huron Mountains region with the central segment marked as \\"Impassable\\". The first path along part of the modern M-35 roadway was the Sault and Green Bay Trail, an old Native American trail, between Menominee and Escanaba. This trail continued eastward from Escanaba to Sault Ste. Marie and southerly to Green Bay, Wisconsin. It was a narrow path of approximately in width, wide enough to permit single-file traffic. Another route, the Carp River Trail, paralleled the path of M-35 from Escanaba to the Marquette area as well. These footpaths were later used for the basis of gravel roads a century before the modern state highway system was created. On May 13, 1913, the Legislature created the state's highway system; M-35 was not initially included. The system was signposted six year later, and M-35 was to run from M-12/M-15 (modern US 2/US 41) at Gladstone in the south to Palmer before terminating in Negaunee at M-15 (modern US 41). Several maps showed M-35 continuing north to L'Anse. At the time of M-35's creation, another designation, M-91, was assigned to a highway from Menominee northward to Cedar River. By 1930, M-35 was extended southerly along US 2/US 41 from Gladstone to Escanaba. From there, M-35 continued as a new highway along the Green Bay shoreline to Cedar River and supplanted M-91. = Huron Mountains = In 1919, the State Department of Highways, forerunner to today's MDOT, designated a scenic shoreline trunkline to run north from Negaunee to Skanee and L'Anse by way of Big Bay. The highway would continue from the L'Anse and Baraga area to eventually end at Ontonagon at an intersection with M-64. Local Upper Peninsula historian Fred Rydholm summarized the routing planned in 1925 as extending \\"... in a northwesterly direction, across the Dead River, over the Panorama Hills, then west past the Elm Creek swamp, along the south side of Burnt Mountain, across the Cedar Creek, the Cliff Stream and out past Cliff Lake to Skanee and L'Anse\\". This highway was designated as an extension of M-35, which ended in downtown Negaunee. Work was completed on a significant portion of the route in Marquette County by 1926. M-35 was routed east along M-15 toward Marquette before turning north-northwesterly toward Big Bay. This section of roadway follows the modern County Road 510 (CR 510) in Marquette County. Similar work was completed in Baraga County connecting L'Anse and Skanee by 1932. Construction on the two ends left the center portion through the Huron Mountains unfinished and shown on state maps as a dashed line marked \\"impassable\\". One section running northwesterly from the modern CR 510 toward the Salmon Trout River, complete with guard rails and cement culverts has been called \\"Blind 35\\" since. = The Steel Bridge = alt=Historic photo of the Steel Bridge over the Dead River One of the first tasks for the State Highway Department was bridging the Dead River in Negaunee Township, north of US 41. The state solved the problem by buying a bridge in Pennsylvania, where bridges of this design were more common. MDOT describes the bridge as: The bridge is still in place over the Dead River and previously carried CR 510 as the successor to M-35 in northern Marquette County. Known locally as \\"The Steel Bridge\\", it survived a May 15, 2003, flood caused by the breaching of the Silver Lake Dam. The Marquette County Road Commission had announced plans in 2006 to bypass the Steel Bridge with a modern replacement, leaving the existing bridge as a footpath or bike path. Construction on the bypass road and replacement bridge was begun in October 2007. The concrete work for the replacement span was started in late 2009, with an original projected completion date of November 1, 2010. The new crossing is above river level compared to the for the 1921 span. The total budget for bridge construction was $4.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) with an additional $1.7 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the approach work; the project had an 80 percent federal, 15 percent state and 5 percent county funding split. The new bridge opened to traffic in September 2010, diverting traffic from the Steel Bridge. Completion of the new span came after about a decade of planning. = Henry Ford = Records of the Huron Mountain Club, an exclusive private organization with large land holdings in northern Michigan, show that Henry Ford visited the Upper Peninsula many times, including at least once with Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison on Ford's yacht, Sialia. Many of these trips involved research to keep his operations supplied. His UP land provided wood for the manufacture of Ford automobiles such as the Model T, which required of lumber per car. Ford, who was considering becoming the \\"owner–producer–handler\\" of the resources he needed, invested in sawmills in Alberta and Kingsford. He also bought the entire town of Pequaming, along the shores of the Keweenaw Bay. The town belonged to Dan Hebard, who also sold Ford a sawmill, tugboats, a 14-room bungalow, and land near the Huron Mountain Club. Hebard retired to spend his summers at a cabin on the Pine River on land belonging to the Club. Ford built a hydroelectric dam along the Menominee River to supply power to the Kingsford mill, bought the Imperial Mine, and opened the Blueberry Mine near Ishpeming to supply iron ore. The Ford Railroad was constructed between L'Anse and the Cliff River for his logging operations on of timberland purchased in 1922. He often visited the Upper Peninsula on business, but as early as 1917, the year he ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate, he sought entry into the Huron Mountain Club. Since the club limited its membership, Ford worked to improve his chances. His admission would ultimately come when M-35 construction was halted in the Huron Mountains. Hunters, campers, hikers, fishermen, and some landowners opposed highway construction near the Huron Mountains. Rydholm said, \\"... there seemed to be no groundswell of sentiment in favor of it, but it looked as the though the die was cast and nothing could be done to stop it\\". The Huron Mountain Club members opposed the highway because it would open vast reaches of the back country and might harm the wilderness. Highway construction would also open the possibility of a resort hotel; William C. Weber, a real estate developer from Detroit, owned property along Mountain Lake, in northern Marquette County. A Michigan attorney general's opinion provided a way for blocking the road if two-thirds of the property over which the road would pass was owned by people opposed to the project. The proposed highway was to cross two parcels of Huron Mountain Club property, but that was not enough to halt construction. In 1926, Hebard was elected the new president at the Huron Mountain Club and changed its rules for admission. Before the changes, all existing members voted on new admissions, and four \\"no\\" votes meant rejection. After Hebard's changes, only club directors could vote, and only one \\"no\\" was needed to block election. In 1927, the road grading for M-35 had reached the Salmon Trout River. That same year, Ford bought more land near Mountain Lake. This property encompassed more than the requisite two-thirds necessary to stop construction of the road. In 1928, the road was moved to connect with the Big Bay Road (CR 550), leaving the stub of \\"Blind 35\\" behind. According to club records, \\"by 1929, M-35 was dead in its tracks and Henry Ford was a member\\". To commemorate his membership, Ford built a white pine log cabin on club property that cost between $80,000 and $100,000 in 1929 (equivalent to $ to $ in ). = After Ford = In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L'Anse was officially canceled as a state trunkline highway. Constructed portions were turned over to local control, becoming Skanee Road in Baraga County and CR 510 in Marquette County. This left a discontinuous routing for 13 years. The southern segment of M-35 ran from Menominee to Negaunee, and the northern segment ran from Baraga to Ontonagon along the modern M-38. The two segments were rejoined in 1953, closing the gap left by the cancelled Huron Mountain route. M-35 signs were added to existing highway signs westward from the end of the southern segment at Negaunee along US 41/M-28 and US 41 to Baraga, to connect with the northern segment westward to Ontonagon. In 1964, several abandoned underground mine shafts collapsed underneath the roadway, forcing a rerouting of M-35 out of the City of Negaunee. Right of way for the M-35 relocation was purchased between March 20, 1964, and October 12, 1964. Before the rerouting, M-35 was routed from Palmer north to Negaunee using a portion of County Road near Lucy Hill. It also followed Silver Street connecting with part of Business M-28, a business loop of M-28, through downtown Negaunee to US 41 north of town. This former segment is still shown on some maps (such as Google Maps) as \\"Old M-35\\". Since this rerouting, M-35 runs from Palmer past Goose Lake to end in Negaunee Township. The only naturbahn, or natural track, luge run in North America crosses the former routing of M-35 in Negaunee.. This luge run crosses over the abandoned street at the end of County Road at Lucy Hill. The last major changes to M-35 came in January 1969 when the section from Baraga to Ontonagon was given the M-38 designation. The M-35 concurrencies were removed along US 41/M-28 and US 41 in Marquette and Baraga counties. This change shortened the highway designation and moved the northern terminus to the present location in Negaunee Township. Since then, sections of the roadway were realigned in Richmond Township south of Palmer to straighten some of the many curves between Palmer and Gwinn in 1989. MDOT constructed a new 20-space commuter parking lot at the southern terminus of M-553 at M-35 in August 2008 as part of an effort to offer expanded ride-sharing opportunities in Marquette County. Tourist routes The southern section of M-35 is a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT). This tour was created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario. On August 26, 2007, MDOT designated the southern section of M-35 along Lake Michigan as the UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail running for between Menominee and Gladstone.. As a part of the Pure Michigan Byways Program, M-35 passes the mouths of the Cedar and Bark rivers. Wells State Park is located on M-35 in Cedar River and Fuller Park is at the mouth of the Bark River..

It is the second book published in the Lonesome Dove series, but the fourth and final book chronologically. It was adapted into a television miniseries in 1995. Introduction The book follows the adventures of Captain Woodrow F. Call as he tracks a Mexican bandit who is preying on the railroad. It was later made into a television miniseries of the same name starring James Garner as Captain Call. Streets of Laredo takes its name from a famous cowboy ballad. The title was originally used by Larry McMurtry for a screenplay that he wrote with Peter Bogdanovich, but which never materialized as a movie. He then rewrote it as the original Lonesome Dove. =Between Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo= Between the events of the two books, quite a bit has happened. Lorena, lover of Gus McCrae, has left Clara and married Pea Eye Parker, of the former Hat Creek Outfit. They have several children, and own a farm in the Texas Panhandle. Pea Eye is thoroughly devoted to Lorena, and Lorena has learned to reciprocate and become almost equally attached to Pea Eye. Lorena teaches in a nearby schoolhouse. The cattle ranch (set up by the Hat Creek outfit in Montana) has collapsed. Newt is dead, fallen on by the Hell Bitch. Call has finally admitted to himself that Newt was his son. July Johnson is dead, and Clara lives alone. Call has gone back to being a Ranger and a gun- for-hire. Trains have greatly expanded the reach of civilization and have pushed back the frontier. The American West is no longer rough and tumble and Captain Woodrow F. Call has become a relic, albeit a greatly respected one. Nineteen-year-old Joey Garza and his deadly German rifle (capable of killing a man at a distance of half a mile) are not about to let law and order close the book on the Wild West just yet. Plot summary =Part I: A Salaried Man= The book opens with former Ranger Captain Woodrow F. Call (now a bounty hunter) and Ned Brookshire, the \\"salaried man\\" of the title. Brookshire has been sent to Texas from New York City by his boss, railroad tycoon Colonel Terry, to contract Call's services in apprehending a bandit. The bandit in question is a young Mexican named Joey Garza, who has cost Terry significant business and money through his deadly train robberies. Brookshire is surprised that the old man he encounters has such a reputation, though he notes that Call does have a rather dangerous and respect-demanding aura about him. Brookshire himself does not strike a particularly imposing figure, and soon proves not to be cut out for train or horse travel, inexperienced in the ways of the west or violence, and very homesick for his bossy but loving wife, Katie. Call, on the other hand, is the very picture of experience. Though he is old and seems almost to have trouble lifting his foot into the stirrups, his reputation speaks for him. He has spent forty years on the border and the frontier, many of those with his more talkative but equally respected late partner, Gus McCrae. Protecting settlers in innumerable skirmishes with hostile Indians, rustlers, and dangerous gangs has earned him a great deal of respect and a reputation that generally strikes fear into the hearts of criminals. Family is a focal point of McMurtry's book, with the emphasis on two very different families. One is that of Pea Eye Parker, Call's corporal, a fellow former-ranger who assists Call in his bounty-hunter duties. Pea Eye is now married to Lorena Wood (Lorie), the whore heroine of Lonesome Dove and now a school teacher and mother of five. Pea Eye is increasingly pressured by his wife and children to stop following the captain in pursuit of bandits, but his loyalty and devotion to Call usually prevails. Though he initially refuses to accompany Call and Brookshire in the hunt for Joey Garza, his guilt wins out and he soon sets out after Call, accompanied by the celebrated Kickapoo tracker, Famous Shoes. The second family that dominates the plot of Streets of Laredo is the family of Joey Garza. Joey's mother, Maria, is the midwife of a small Mexican village on the Rio Grande. She has had a string of brief, failed marriages and has three children, of which Joey is the oldest. Of the other two, her daughter, Teresa, is blind from birth, while her other, Rafael, is very slow. One of Maria's husbands sold Joey to the Apache Indians as a slave when he was a small boy; by the time he came back to Maria and her family, he was a bitter, angry, silent boy who was obsessed with killing and stealing (unknown to Maria, Joey killed her third husband, the only one who was kind to her or her children). Joey possesses a fine German rifle with a telescopic sight, which enables him to shoot his victims from a half-mile away. At the outset of the novel, Joey is hiding out in Crow Town, an outlaw village deep in the borderland desert. One of the other notorious denizens of Crow Town is the legendary Texas gunfighter, John Wesley Hardin. Maria travels by horse to Crow Town to warn Joey that Call is on his trail. Joey disappears, stealing his mother's horse, and rides to Langtry, Texas, where he shoots and hangs Judge Roy Bean, the \\"Law West of the Pecos\\". =Part II: The Manburner= As Call and Brookshire search for Joey Garza, they discover that he is not the only outlaw preying on the railroad. A string of strange murders soon leads Call in the pursuit of a ghost from the past - Mox Mox (or, as the Apache call him, \\"The Snake You Do Not See\\"). A former flunky of Blue Duck, of Lonesome Dove fame, Mox Mox is known for burning his captives alive. Mox Mox was thought to have been killed years before, but had just been in hiding at sea, and has now returned at the head of a murderous gang. The news is especially traumatic for Lorie, who herself had nearly been burnt by the villain while she was a captive of Blue Duck. Fearing for the lives of her children, Lorie sends them to Nebraska, to the protection of her friend Clara Allen. She then sets off to find Pea Eye to warn him. Pea Eye and the Kickapoo Famous Shoes, unaware of the threat of Mox Mox, continue south to find Captain Call. They are thrown into the Presidio jail when the sheriff accuses Famous Shoes of being a horse thief (he came across Famous Shoes eating a dead horse several years ago and decided that it was stolen) and decides to hang him. Captain Call hears of their plight and frees them from jail (near-killing the sheriff in the process in a furious beating) and continues in pursuit of Mox Mox. He ambushes the gang just as they are about to burn two children alive, killing outright all but two - Quick Jimmy, a renegade Cherokee, who escapes unscathed, and Mox Mox himself, who limps off to die. =Part III: Maria's Children= After rescuing Pea Eye and Famous Shoes from a corrupt bordertown sheriff, Call and his gang close in on Joey Garza. Ned Brookshire is killed in a scuffle; the anticipated confrontation between Call and Joey leaves Call seriously wounded; Lorie must amputate a leg to save him. The Mexican bandit is instead shot and mortally wounded by Pea Eye. Garza then drags himself back to his native village and attempts to kill his younger siblings, Teresa and Rafael, for whom he has long reserved his greatest hatred. Maria, mother of the three children, attempts to stop Joey; he stabs her. A local villager then shoots Joey dead. Maria dies from her wounds, and at her request, Pea Eye and Lorie adopt Maria's two surviving children, returning with them to their farm. Call, crippled and no longer able to pursue bandits, goes to live with them. He becomes increasingly attached to Teresa, Maria's blind daughter, demonstrating for the first time an attachment to anyone besides Gus McCrae, and perhaps, secretly his son Newt.

The story first appeared in the November 1957 issue of Venture Science Fiction Magazine, and was reprinted in the collection Nine Tomorrows in 1959, in a bowdlerized version. The complete original version appeared in Asimov's Mysteries (1968). It is a mystery story in a science fiction setting. Plot summary A Galactic Service agent, Max, is in Marsport without his wife, Hilda, for the first time in a long time. He plans to visit a beautiful and accommodating woman of his acquaintance named Flora, but his plans are disrupted when he receives an unexpected assignment. His supervisor informs him that a new source of altered Spaceoline has appeared. While regular Spaceoline is a common anti-nausea treatment, a chemical modification can turn it into a dangerous narcotic. The Service suspects that one man in a group of three VIPs is smuggling the drug. All three men appear to be in the inebriated, free-association state which regular Spaceoline produces, but since the actual criminal cannot afford to impair his own judgment, he must be faking. The easiest method of determining the criminal among them would be a simple search. However, Max's supervisor firmly rejects this: only one of three men is guilty, and the consequences of performing such a rough operation on two innocent men of very high social standing would be extremely unfortunate. Max is forced to improvise. Max converses with the three men, trying to find the faker, but the criminal is clever enough to avoid detection. All three men take turns free-associating among themselves, and all three keep making statements which might be subtle clues or taunts, but could equally well be innocent. Growing ever more desperate as his time runs out, Max starts describing his planned evening with Flora in graphic detail. The two honest men are too inebriated to be affected, but the faker starts sweating and his breath becomes heavier, and that gives him away. Max manages to convince his overjoyed supervisor to give him a substantial monetary bonus in return for his service, which he uses to smooth over the problems between himself and Flora that arose when he had to postpone their date. However, just as he is about to meet Flora, his wife arrives in Marsport.

It is the third book published in the Lonesome Dove series but the first installment in terms of chronology. McMurtry wrote a fourth segment to the Lonesome Dove chronicle, Comanche Moon, which describes the events of the central characters' lives between Dead Man's Walk and Lonesome Dove. The second novel in the Lonesome Dove series was the 1993 sequel to the original, called Streets of Laredo. Dead Man’s Walk was later adapted into a three-part miniseries of the same name, which aired in May, 1996. Plot summary In 1842, young Texas Rangers Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call are introduced quickly and brutally to the rangering life on their first expedition, in which they are stalked by the Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump. After a narrow escape, the rangers return to civilization, only to quickly join an expedition to capture and annex Santa Fe, part of New Mexico (the part east of the Rio Grande) for Texas. The expedition, led by pirate and soldier of fortune, Caleb Cobb, is ultimately a failure; of the 200 initial adventurers, only about 40 survive, falling to starvation, bears, and Indians, only to be swiftly arrested by the Mexican authorities. Those survivors are forced to march the Jornada del Muerto (\\"Dead Man's Walk\\") to El Paso, and many, Mexican and Texan alike, die along the journey. The Texas contingent is reduced to ten persons when the captives panic after they observe cavalry drilling and are slaughtered in a blood lust as they flee. At their destination, the ten are forced to gamble for their lives by drawing a bean from a jar - a white bean signals life, a black bean death. Call and McCrae are among the five survivors. The last Rangers then return to Texas, escorting an Englishwoman and her son, who have also been held captive by the Mexicans.

Call and the mother of his illegitimate son Newt. Background Dead Man's Walk details the earliest adventures of the young Woodrow F. Call and Augustus McCrae as they join up with the Texas Rangers on a fictional expedition based loosely on the historical Texan Santa Fe Expedition of 1841. Although the exact time frame of the story is not given, the historical context of the events occurring sometime in the early 1840s is authentic. The Republic of Texas did indeed attempt to annex part of New Mexico, in what historians refer to as the Texan Santa Fe Expedition. As seen in this story, it was a failure. During the course of this book, three other familiar and important characters are introduced. At a general store, McCrae meets Clara Forsythe, later to marry Robert Allen and become Clara Allen, Augustus's old flame in the original novel. In the same town, Call meets a prostitute named Maggie, later to become the mother of his illegitimate son, Newt. On their journey, they are tracked by the notorious Comanche warrior Buffalo Hump, future father of Blue Duck, whom they will hunt during their later days as Texas Rangers. Call and Gus also briefly encounter a fictionalized version of Charles Goodnight, a rancher and future close friend of Call's in Streets of Laredo. Adaptations In May 1996 it was screened on ABC as a two-part miniseries starring David Arquette as Augustus McCrae and Jonny Lee Miller as Woodrow F. Call.

The majority of Danny Deckchair was shot in Bellingen, a Mid North Coast town in New South Wales. It was inspired by the story of the Lawnchair Larry flight. Plot Danny Morgan (Ifans) works as a concrete maker driver and construction worker who lives in a big Australian city with his girlfriend but is unhappy with his life. Danny yearns for the simple life while girlfriend Trudy (Clarke) fantasizes about bright lights and fast times. While Danny plans for their annual camping trip, Trudy tells him she has to work, so the trip is off. In reality, Trudy is using her work connections at a local real estate agency to set up a meeting with a handsome local sports reporter, Sandy Upman (Muldoon). Danny sees them together while he's shopping for a weekend barbecue, leaving him even more disenchanted with their relationship. During the barbecue in his backyard, Danny, being an inventive character, ties a bunch of helium-filled balloons to his deckchair as his friends hold him down. When they inadvertently let go, Danny is set on an airborne adventure across Australia, which causes him to become a national sensation. As he floats over idyllically beautiful rural landscapes, totally foreign to the concrete structures of his discontent, he appears on the verge of some enlightenment. After he's beaten up in a rugged ride through a thunderstorm, fireworks from a small town's macadamia festival burst his balloons. Danny lands in a tree in Glenda's front yard as the remnants of his chair float away. Glenda (Otto), who was watching the fireworks from her front porch, sees Danny fall into the tree but doesn't see the deckchair. As firemen and townsfolk arrive to find out if the fireball caused any damage, they see Glenda helping a disheveled Danny. Glenda tells them that Danny is an old professor from college days and takes him into her house, which belonged to her parents. As he recovers from the harrowing end to his journey, the lonely Glenda, fascinated by the strapping Danny, doesn't press him about his past. Danny doesn't help matters by offering only vague explanations about his origins and unorthodox arrival in the town of Clarence. As Danny explores the town, Glenda's friends wonder about their past relationship, but they are quickly won over by Danny's whimsical ways. This was easy to accomplish as Glenda's friends are just happy to see that the withdrawn, and sometimes despised, traffic officer is with someone special. Using his easy-going manner, Danny persuades Glenda to dress-up and go with him to the harvest ball. She gives him some nice clothes (formerly her father's) to wear to the ball. After Danny looks in the mirror, he shaves his beard and trims his hair. At the ball and around town, Danny's mysterious past, detached demeanour and off-the-wall ideas make him an instant hit with the townsfolk. His ideas that were considered hair-brained in the big city seem fresh in the small town of Clarence, and he is hired to become the manager of an aspiring politician's campaign. As they spend time together at Glenda's house, Danny finds her father's old motorcycle, which for sentimental reasons Glenda keeps in the shed. After she shows Danny pictures of her parents on the motorcycle exploring the country, Danny fixes up the old motorcycle when Glenda is at work. All the while, the big city media can't get enough coverage of Danny's disappearance, constantly broadcasting interviews of his friends, family and co-workers. Trudy takes up with the sports reporter (Muldoon), who sees covering Danny's story and Trudy's suffering as a way to the top. Back in Clarence, Danny is forging a deep connection with Glenda. But their budding relationship is not viewed by everyone in town as all peaches-and-cream. Their flirtations arouse jealousy and suspicion in Glenda's male co-worker, the town's police supervisor, who busts them for speeding when they take Glenda's motorcycle out for a ride. But nothing fazes Danny as he continues to immerse himself in his ideal world. He even goes so far as to give a stirring speech at a political rally, and he is asked by some of the townsfolk to run for office. All caught up in the dizzying events surrounding the political rally, Glenda and Danny spend the night together. He wakes reveling in his new soul- mate, gets dressed in a haze of happiness and steps outside onto Glenda's porch to greet the dawn of his perfect new life. However, local kids have found and reported the deck chair causing Danny's past to come crashing down upon him in a torrent of media frenzy. As a shocked Glenda emerges from her house to see what all the noise is about, she spots Danny running down the street with a crowd in hot pursuit. Just then, Trudy and Upman drop down in a news helicopter and land in the street in front of Glenda's yard, stopping Danny dead in his tracks. Trudy reclaims Danny amidst an explosion of camera flashes to take him back to the big city, where she can bask in his new-found fame. As his half-truths become uncovered in the stark light of media exposure, Glenda rails against Danny as he's whisked away. Although she is angry at being deceived by Danny, his departure brings Glenda to the stark realization that she has been deceiving herself as well. She finally admits to herself that her life is at a dead end and she decides it's time for a change. Meanwhile, unhappily plugged back into his old job and with Trudy trying to capitalize on his fame, the deep changes within Danny that happened in Clarence make city life all the more unbearable. Danny confronts Trudy, tells her it's over and uses the connections his media storm have forged to get on a military plane to win Glenda back. Back in Clarence, Glenda has finished packing up her motorcycle and is saying goodbye to her friends. Just then, Danny parachutes out of the plane over Clarence and crash-lands in the tree in front of Glenda's house as she's starting to leave on her motorcycle. At first, Glenda appears excited to see Danny; but immediately she starts yelling that he can't just drop in and everything will be all right. Glenda resolutely drives off before Danny can convince her how much he needs her and his new life in the town of Clarence. Dragging his parachute, Danny runs after her, shouting that he'll do whatever it takes to get back together. As she drives away, Danny's parachute cord gets caught on the back of the motorcycle and he is lifted into the air. As Glenda glances into her mirror for one last look at her old life, she notices Danny flying behind her and stops the bike. As he comes down, Danny and Glenda get entangled in the parachute, wordlessly embrace and kiss. As the movie ends, Danny and Glenda, in their bathrobes, symbolically float upward in deck chairs as they talk about their future plans.

It is in the northcentral part of Gran Canaria. Valleseco means \\"dry valley\\" in Spanish, but is actually one of the wettest municipalities of the island. Its population is 3,904 (2013),Instituto Canario de Estadística, population and the area is 22.11 km². The elevation is 1,000 m. The town Valleseco is situated 3 km southwest of Teror and 17 km southwest of the city of Las Palmas. Its landscape is characterized by deep valleys and ravines and a great vegetal richness that has resulted in more than 80% of the territory being protected by Nature Reserves. Valleseco, at 1000 m. above sea level, often seems to be enveloped in a \\"sea of clouds\\". This helps to make the landscape very lush. Here, the trade winds deposit its precipitations, which, according to a local saying, \\"seem not to wet but soak\\", a type of wealth in the form of rain so appreciated by the country person, who thus sees his effort rewarded with productive crops of potatoes, corn and fruits. Places of interest =The heart of the municipality= Possibly the best known building in Valleseco can be found here; the Saint Vicente Ferrer's Temple. Of simple construction, it is also the oldest building in Valleseco (1898), highlighting the pulpit and the coffering in its interior, built in mudejar style. There are also some images of great historical and artistic value that come from the old chapel that preceded this church, and a reliquary, containing part of a bone of the saint's arm, is venerated. The greatest reliquary, however, is a German organ from the 18TH century which came from the Church of the Pino in Teror and which has been recently restored/ In the Cornmeal Mill, built more than 80 years ago, two revolving stones grind the grain of maize and produce the toasted cornmeal, known as \\"gofio\\". The Tourist Information Office is also located in the heart of the village. There is a permanent craftwork exhibition with different works, such as fabrics, musical instruments, wooden furniture, traditional Canarian costumes and openwork, made by artisans of the region. =The Barranco de la Virgen= The Barranco de la Virgen is one of the two principal ravines that cross the municipality of Valleseco. Flanked by high mountains, it is possible to listen the sound of silence. As part of the Parque Rural de Doramas (Doramas Rural Park), the Barranco de la Virgen gives shelter to a forest of laurisilva, that used to cover the whole interior of the island in the past. One of its tributaries, the Barranco Oscuro, is especially notorious and, as it has received the category of Total Nature Reserve, it has the highest possible protection within the Canarian Nature Reserve Network. It runs between high cliffs that have preserved the endemic flora, which in many cases, can only be found in this area. Due to its abundance of water and its fertile lands, a flourishing agriculture was soon developed in the region and several stately buildings and estates of traditional architecture were built. These can still be seen along the ravine nowadays as well as the traces of ancient mills that bear witness to the past of the region linked to water. =La Laguna= Around 2.5K away from the town center, La Laguna de Valleseco is located her with access from the crossroads between the roads to Teror GC-21 and Firgas GC-30. The recreational area of La Laguna, situated in the Parque Rural de Doramas, was formed by a volcanic crater whose interior is covered with the distinctive vegetation of the laurisilva. The different trees that constitute this forest, the only one in the world, can be observed by walking by La Laguna. In fact, it is a small lagoon which all types of fowls approach to drink, from the little birds such as canaries and alpispas, to migratory birds such as herons. =The summit= Following the GC-21 towards the high part of the municipality, we enter the Nature Reserve of the Protected Landscape of the Peaks, which is a territory of important vegetation for the collecting of water on the island. Many species of plants of botanical interest are located in this area, highlighting the Canarian pine among others. Above Lanzarote, Gran Canaria's washing area there is a nature reserve called Cortijo de Calderetas. Access is gained from the road walking across a short track. Its historical origins date back to the time of the conquest of the island, just as the other estates found when continuing the route: Cueva Corcho, Crespo, Almaderos, Mesas de Galaz. It has large expanses of pine forest and chestnuts that have been reforested where, previously, there was nothing more than wasteland or pastureland. In the distance, the city of Las Palmas can sometimes be seen. The Montañón Negro (Big Black Mountain) rises in the limit of the municipality. The rugged and dry landscape reveals its recent volcanic origin. Due to its geological characteristics it has been declared a natural monument, now belonging to the Canarian Nature Reserve Network. Gastronomy In Valleseco there is a wide variety of gastronomy, mainly based on meat: pork, goat, beef or rabbit, marinaded, stewed or with sauce. The specialities are: the \\"mojo the cochino\\" (pork with typical Canarian sauce), kid goat in sauce, marinaded pork and rabbit, beef stew, roasted pork leg. Other well- known dishes are: vegetable stew with jaramagos, picked in the country, where they grow wild; watercress stew, made with this vegetable that grows in places designed for it; coriander soup, served with kneaded toasted cornmeal and goat cheese. Festivals The main festivals in Valleseco are to honor Saint Vicente Ferrer, in mid May or at the beginning of June, depending on Easter. Another major celebration takes place the first Sunday of October in honor of Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación. It is also the Apple Festival, in which people of the town arrive dressed with traditional costumes the day previous to the main celebration day.

Founded in 1964, it comprises eight faculties and five institutes and has a student enrollment of approximately 13,000. It is based in three campuses in Bujumbura and a fourth in Gitega. It took its current name in 1977 and is Burundi's only publicly funded university.  History  The origins of the University of Burundi can be traced to the Agronomy Institute of the University of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi, founded under Belgian colonial rule. In 1960 this became the Agronomical Institute of Ruanda-Urundi (Institut agronomique du Ruanda-Urundi) and moved to Bujumbura, becoming the country's first major centre of higher education. Under the initiative of the Jesuit missions, three other specialist institutions subsequently emerged in Bujumbura after Burundi's independence in 1962. These institutions were merged to form the Official University of Bujumbura (Université officielle de Bujumbura, or UOB) in January 1964. In 1977, the UOB merged with two vocational institutions to create the University of Burundi (Université du Burundi, or UB). Teaching at the university has been significantly disrupted by political upheaval elsewhere in Burundi since independence. The Burundian Civil War (1993–2006) created particular problems, as did the accompanying socio-economic crisis which led to strikes, funding problems, and a brain drain of academic staff overseas. On 11–12 June 1995 ethnic Hutu students were massacred at the university by ethnic Tutsi. Its alumni include Pierre Nkurunziza who served as President of Burundi from 2005 to 2020. He studied physical education and later held a post as assistant lecturer at the university before being forced to flee in 1995. His successor, Évariste Ndayishimiye, also studied law at the university before the violence of 1995 but did not complete his studies. UB is affiliated to the Inter- University Council for East Africa (IUCEA), Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM), the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF), and the Conseil Africain et Malagache pour l'enseignement supérieur (CAMES).  Schools and institutes  View of the University's buildings in Bujumbura The university is divided into faculties and institutes which are themselves made up of departments. The university currently comprises: ;Faculties: * Faculty of Agronomy and Bioengineering (Faculté d'Agronomie et de Bio-Ingénieurie) * Faculty of Law (Faculté de Droit) * Faculty of Medicine (Faculté de la Médecine) * Faculty of Psychology and Educational Science (Faculté de Psychologie et des Sciences de l'Education) * Faculty of Economic Sciences and Management (Faculté des Sciences Economiques et de Gestion) * Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences (Faculté des Lettres et Sciences Humaine) * Faculty of Sciences (Faculté des Sciences) * Faculty of Engineering Sciences (Faculté des Sciences de l'Ingénieur) ;Institutes: * Confucius Institute for Chinese language (Institut Confucius), affiliated to the international Confucius Institute programme * Institute of Applied Pedagogy (Institut de Pédagogie appliquée) * Institute of Physical Education and Sport (Institut d'Education physique et de Sport) * Institute of Applied Statistics (Institut des Statistiques appliquées) * Higher Institute of Commerce (Institut supérieur de Commerce) References =Bibliography= * * External links * University of Burundi Category:Universities in Burundi University of Bujumbura Category:Educational institutions established in 1964 Category:1964 establishments in Burundi ","title":"University of Burundi"},{"id":"2082573","text":"Iniminimagimo was a French language children's television show made in Quebec.

AQB's leader is Ziyad al-Nakhalah, based in Damascus, Syria.IDF: Islamic Jihad 'deliberately' fired rocket that landed offshore The head of AQB in the Gaza Strip was Baha Abu al-Ata until he was killed in November 2019. AQB's parent organization, PIJ, is devoted to the establishment of an Islamic state, and the settlement of Palestinians in what it considers their rightful homeland within the geographic borders of the pre-1948 British-mandated Palestine. It refuses to participate in political processes or negotiations about a swap of Israeli and Palestinian settlements. The PIJ is majority funded by Iran.THE TERRORIST CONNECTION - IRAN, THE ISLAMIC JIHAD AND HAMAS History Al-Quds Brigades was founded in 1981 by Fathi Shaqaqi and Abd Al Aziz Awda in Gaza, and has been active in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, especially in the town of Jenin. Awda was designated a \\"Specially Designated Terrorist\\" by United States on 23 January 1995, and Shiqaqi was assassinated in Malta on 26 October 1995. The group undertook numerous attacks on Israeli civilians, including suicide bombings; and has suffered extensive operations against its infrastructure carried out by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which resulted in severe losses to the group, and it appeared significantly weakened by 2004. On 1 March 2006, Abu al-Walid al-Dahdouh, an AQB commander, was targeted and killed by an Israeli air strike in Gaza City as he drove past the Palestinian finance ministry. On 30 August 2006, the AQB West Bank leader, Hussam Jaradat, was shot and killed by undercover IDF in Jenin on 30 August 2006. In the Gaza Strip, al-Quds Brigades continued its militant activities, including the indiscriminate firing of al-Quds rocket attacks out of populated civilian areas. Al-Quds Brigades promotes the military destruction of Israel, including the indiscriminate firing of rocket, mortar fire and suicide bombings. The international community considers the use of indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations and the use of human shields illegal under international law. In March 2014, over 100 rockets were launched into southern Israel by PIJ and other Islamist groups. On 14 March, Ramadan Shalah, the then leader of PIJ, announced that the attack was coordinated with Hamas. Baha Abu al-Ata, the head of AQB in the Gaza Strip, was killed in a targeted killing in Gaza City on 12 November 2019, allegedly after having given orders for the launching of rockets into Israel. At the same time, Syrian media reported that another senior PIJ commander, Akram al-Ajouri, survived an airstrike in Damascus, but his son and daughter were killed. The next day, AQB launched more than 220 rockets into southern and central Israel, and on the next day the IDF struck several PIJ targets in the Gaza Strip killing two Palestinians, identified as 38-year-old Khaled Moawad Faraj, AQB's field commander, and 32-year-old Alaa Ashtyawu. Later that day, three more AQB members were killed in an Israeli Air Force airstrike while attempting to launch rockets into Israel.ISLAMIC JIHAD TERRORIST'S HOME HIT BY IDF AIRSTRIKE - REPORT A ceasefire was agreed for 14 November, by which time AQB had launched over 400 rockets into Israel and a total of 36 Palestinians had been killed, including 25 members of PIJ or other factions in the Strip.IDF remains on high alert as rockets threaten cease fire This time, Hamas made no effort to stand with or assist PIJ.

The term now usually denotes a portable folding chair, with a single strip of fabric or vinyl forming the backrest and seat. It is meant for leisure, originally on the deck of an ocean liner or cruise ship. It is easily transportable and stackable, although some styles are notoriously difficult to fold and unfold. Different versions may have an extended seat, meant to be used as a leg rest, whose height may be adjustable; and may also have arm rests. History and usage In Northern Europe, the remains of folding chairs have been found dating back to the Bronze Age. Foldable chairs were also used in Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. During the Middle Ages, the folding chair was widely used as a liturgical furniture piece . In the United States, an early patent for a folding chair was by John Cham in 1855.Patent 13479, Folding Chair Folding wooden chairs with woven or cane seats and backs, of the type now known in the UK as \\"steamer chairs\\", began to be used on ocean liner decks from about the 1860s, and were known at the time as \\"deck chairs\\". It is unclear whether they were first made in the US or Britain. Antony Woodward, Design Dinosaurs: 5. The Deck Chair, The Independent, 27 February 1994.

The Guardian, Notes and Queries, \\"Who invented the deck chair?\\". Retrieved 31 December 2012 Early versions of the deck chair were made of two rectangular wooden frames hinged together, with a third rectangle to maintain it upright. A rectangular piece of canvas, of the type used in hammocks, was attached to two of the wooden rectangles to provide a seat and support. The use of a single broad strip of canvas, originally olive green in colour but later usually of brightly coloured stripes, has been credited to a British inventor named Atkins in the late 19th century, although advertisements of 1882 for a similar design refer to it as \\"The Yankee Hammock Chair\\", implying an American origin. Other sources refer to it as the \\"Brighton beach chair\\" or \\"chaise transatlantique\\" (\\"chaise transat\\"). The term 'deck' chair was used in the novels of E. Nesbit in the 1880s, and passengers on P & O liners in the 1890s were encouraged to take their own on board. BBC h2g2, \\"The Deckchair\\". Retrieved 31 December 2012 The classic deckchair can only be locked in one position. Later, the strips of wood going toward the back were lengthened and equipped with supports so that there were several possible sitting positions. A removable footrest can also add to the comfort of the user. Folding deckchairs became widely popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the golden age of ocean liner travel, the deckchairs upon ships' decks were sometimes reserved for particular passengers for whom crew would attach a paperboard name tag to the wicker seat-back. Such a tag is visible on an empty deckchair near the center in a famous 1912 photo showing survivors of the RMS Titanic disaster after rescue while they rest on the deck of RMS Carpathia. The same system was in use aboard Carpathia two years later; a reservation tag is visible on the empty deckchair in the lower right of a 1914 photo. The deckchairs shown on some of those photographs are of the more solid \\"steamer chair\\" type, rather than the portable canvas-seated chairs. The Titanic carried 600 such wooden chairs; six were known to survive, of which one was sold in 2001 for £35,000. The hiring out of deckchairs, on an hourly or daily basis, became established in British seaside resorts, often for use on piers and promenades, in the early 20th century. They were also often used in large public parks such as Hyde Park, and for spectators at informal sporting events such as local cricket matches. With the widespread availability of lighter and even more portable forms of seating later in the century, the use of deckchairs declined. In one of the largest English resorts, Blackpool, 68,000 deckchairs were rented out in 2003, at £1.50 a day, but tourism officers suggested that they should be phased out, except on the piers themselves, because they were a reminder of the era of \\"cloth caps\\", and had \\"had their time in the 50s and 60s\\".

It is the center of the Masyaf District in the Hama Governorate. As of 2004, Masyaf had a religiously diverse population of 22,000 Ismailis, Alawites and Christians. The city is well known for its large medieval castle, particularly its role as the headquarters of the Nizari Ismailis and their elite Assassins unit. Etymology Throughout the Islamic era and until the modern day, the Arabic name of the city was pronounced in a number of different ways by the inhabitants of the region as Maṣyaf, Maṣyat or Maṣyad. The Arabic name is a local pronunciation that evolved from the Assyrian name Manṣuate. The \\"nṣw\\" in Manṣuate correlates with the Arabic \\"nṣṣ\\", which means \\"to set up\\", according to orientalist scholar Edward Lipinsky. Moreover, Lipinsky suggests that the Assyrian name was likely a configuration of the Assyrian word manṣuwatu which correlates with the Arabic word minaṣṣatu(n), both of which translate as \\"raised platform\\". This translation is indicative of the promontory that the Masyaf fortress occupies which overlooks the rest of the city and the surrounding area. History =Early history= Masyaf is the most probable site of the ancient Aramean city of Mansuate that existed in the 8th century BC. It later served as the administrative center of an Assyrian province by the same name in modern-day central Syria. Masyaf is also likely the site of Marsyas. Roman and Byzantine historians mentioned a city named \\"Marsyas\\" that governed the al-Ghab and Beqaa plains to the north and south of the site, respectively. Masyaf and its fortress were first mentioned by Crusader chroniclers in 1099.Daftary, 2011, p. 115. However, because a fortification at Masyaf likely existed prior to the 11th century, it is probable that the Aleppo-based Hamdanid dynasty built a fort at Masyaf, due to its position as an outpost overlooking the mountain roads. At that time, the fortress was a part of Jund Qinnasrin (Chalcis Province) of the Fatimid Caliphate. In the autumn of 999, Basil II, the Byzantine emperor, destroyed the fortifications at Masyaf as part of his campaign to gain control of Antioch and its environs from the Muslims. The area would later come under Seljuk rule, but in 1099, the Crusaders attempted to wrest control of Masyaf (and the more strategically important Rafania) following their capture of Tripoli. The Seljuk atabeg of Damascus, Toghtekin, launched a military campaign to prevent the loss of the area and reached a short-lived accommodation with the Crusaders whereby Masyaf and Hisn al-Akrad would remain in Muslim hands, but have to pay tribute to the Crusaders. Sometime later, Masyaf was controlled by the Mirdasid dynasty. In 1127, the Mirdasids sold it to the Shaizar-based Banu Munqidh family. =Nizari Ismaili era= In 1140, Masyaf was captured by the Nizari Ismailis, a sect of Ismaili Shia Muslims who had been exiled from their previous stronghold in Alamut in modern-day Iran. The fortress was being defended by a Banu Munqidh mamluk (slave warrior) named Sunqur, who the Ismaili force managed to ambush and kill. The Ismailis had chosen Syria as their new home and successively settled in the cities of Aleppo and Damascus and the fortress of Banias, each time being persecuted and massacred by the authorities or mobs of local residents incited by clerics who accused the Ismailis of being heretics or causing problems. Consequently, the surviving Ismaili leadership decided that establishing bases in Syria's cities and thus relying on the goodwill of various umara (princes) was untenable. Instead, they chose to settle in Jabal Ansariyah, a coastal mountain range dotted with fortresses, including Masyaf. The fortress of Masyaf Following its capture, Masyaf served as the principal fortress for the Ismailis' chief da'i. Together with other fortresses acquired at around the same time, including al-Kahf, Khawabi, al-Qadmus and al-Rusafa, the Ismailis were able to carve an autonomous territory for themselves amid hostile Crusader states and local Muslim dynasties nominally affiliated with the Abbasid Caliphate. Masyaf served as the headquarters of the Ismaili da'i Rashid ad-Din Sinan and his elite unit of fida'i who were known as the Assassins. In the mid-1170s, the Ayyubid sultan Saladin set about conquering Syria, ousting the Crusaders and uniting the Muslim world under Sunni Islam. The Ismailis considered Saladin a more dangerous threat than the Crusaders and allied with Saladin's rival in Aleppo to defeat the Ayyubids. Sinan's men launched two unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Saladin and in 1176, Saladin launched a punitive expedition against the Assassins in the strongly-defended fortress of Masyaf. Within a few days of the siege, Saladin withdrew due to an urgent need to redeploy against the Crusaders who were attacking Ayyubid territory in the Beqaa. He arranged a truce with Sinan mediated by the Ayyubid emir of Hama, Shihab al-Din Mahmud al-Harimi, Saladin's uncle. =Mamluk rule= A wall around the town of Masyaf was built in 1249 by the Persian leader of the Ismailis, Taj al-Din Abu'l Futuh. In 1260, the Mongols under Hulagu conquered most of northern Syria and briefly occupied Masyaf. However, following the Mongols' rout at the Battle of Ain Jalut at the hand of the Bahri Mamluks later that year, they withdrew from Masyaf. In 1262, Masyaf's rulers were ordered to pay tribute to the Mamluk sultan Baibars and some time after, the sultan had Masyaf's emir Najm al-Din Ismail replaced by Sarim al- Din Mubarak. Mubarak was later imprisoned in Cairo by Baibars and Najm ad-Din was briefly restored as emir before Masyaf was fully incorporated into the sultanate in 1270. Ismailis continued inhabiting it throughout Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the century, Masyaf became a major stopping point on the Mamluk postal route and was controlled by a commander who answered directly to the sultan due to its strategic role as a frontier fortress. In 1320, the historian and Ayyubid emir of Hama, Abu'l Fida, noted that Masyaf was a \\"center of the Ismailian Doctrine\\" and that it was \\"beautiful\\" with gardens and a spring from which flowed a small stream.le Strange, 1890, p. 507. According to Ibn Battuta, who passed by the town in 1355, Masyaf was the center of a district belonging to the province of Tripoli and containing the fortress villages of al-Rusafa, al-Kahf, al-Qadmus, al-Ulayqa and al-Maniqa. Masyaf was later separated from Tripoli and transferred to the authority of Damascus province. In the mid-15th century, under Sultan Barsbay, a road was built that connected Masyaf with Tripoli, but the postal route no longer passed through the town. In 1446, the historian Khalil al-Zahiri described Masyaf as \\"a pleasant town, with an extensive countryside\\". =Ottoman era= The fortress and town of Masyaf, c. 1935 Masyaf, along with the rest of Syria, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1516–17 following the Ottoman victory over the Mamluks at the Battle of Marj Dabiq. Masyaf became a part of the liwa (district) of Homs, and along with the other Ismaili fortresses in its vicinity (qala' al-da'wa), was responsible for paying a special tax. The town had a khan (caravanserai) which paid tolls to the Ottoman authorities. The tolls were abolished later in the mid-16th century. According to the Sufi traveler Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, the emir of Masyaf in the early 1690s was a descendant of the Arab Tanukh tribe named Sulayman. In 1703, the Raslan clan, an Alawite tribe, took over Masyaf and controlled it for about eight years until it was restored to the Ismailis following the intervention of the Ottoman authorities.Mirza, 1997, p. 128. In 1788, the emir of Masyaf, Mustafa ibn Idris, built a sabil (ablutions fountain) and a house that would be used by himself and successive Ismaili emirs. In 1808, the Raslan clan led by Sheikh Mahmud Raslan attacked Masyaf, killing its Ismaili chief, Mustafa Milhim,Daftary, 2007, p. 489. and his son, and captured the fortress. About 300 of the town's Ismaili inhabitants were also killed, while many others, including the da'i (religious chief) of Masyaf, fled for Homs, Hama and other areas in central Syria, settling in those places temporarily. The Ismailis had already been in the process of being gradually expelled from Jabal Ansariyah by Alawite clans.Balanche, 2004, pp. 69–70. The Ottoman governor of Damascus, Kunj Yusuf Pasha, intervened in the matter, dispatching a force of 4,000–5,000 soldiers to recapture the town. After three months of fighting, the Raslans surrendered Masyaf. Ismaili control over the town and its fortress was restored in 1810. Two years after the resettlement of Masyaf by the Ismailis, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt recorded an estimated population of 280 families, most of which were Ismaili and 30 were Christian. Burchardt noted that the town's citadel, many houses, the mosque and most other buildings were either heavily damaged or destroyed from previous fighting. Throughout the remainder of the 19th century, Masyaf's population continued to decrease. =Modern era= A view of part of the fortress (foreground) and the modern city of Masyaf (background), 2004 The Allied Powers captured Syria from the Ottomans in 1917, after which the residents largely abandoned the fortress of Masyaf. British general T. E. Lawrence rested in Masyaf and remarked that the fortress was being used as a poorhouse at the time. During the French Mandate over Syria, the French separated the Jabal Ansariyah range from the rest of Syria to form the Alawite State. Masyaf was made a part of the State of Damascus, but in 1929, a number of rural Alawite villages in its immediate vicinity, including al-Rusafa, al-Bayyadiyah, Akakir, Maryamin and Abu Qubays, were ceded to the Alawite State. The latter merged with the rest of Syria in 1936. In 1939, Masyaf and its district was transferred from the Province of Hama to the Province of Latakia. Throughout the 1930s, rooms in the fortress were still being used by local residents. In 1947, a year after Syria became independent from France, 3,808 Ismailis were recorded to be living in Masyaf.Balanche, 2004, p. 92. The Syrian government under President Amin al- Hafiz established Masyaf as a center for carpet weaving in 1965. The weaving workshops mostly employed women. In the 1960s, Masyaf's Ismaili community largely identified with the Nasserist movement, in contrast to the Alawites who dominated the surrounding villages who were mostly associated with the Baathists. In 1970, much of the town of Masyaf still remained within the confines of the city walls. However, by 1998, its population and urban space had expanded considerably outside the walls. The fortress is situated in the northeastern part of Masyaf's old city. The walls remained in place, but the homes and gardens of local residents were built immediately alongside them. Within the walls is a mosque dating to the 12th century and according to local residents, is associated with Saladin. The fortress is considered a national monument and is directly under the authority of the Syrian Directorate of Antiquities. In the Syrian Civil War after 2015, an alleged missile production facility in Masyaf and a base near the town, thought to be used by Iranian forces and militias, became repeatedly targets of airstrikes attributed to Israel. Geography Masyaf is situated along the foothills of the eastern slopes of the Jabal Ansariyah coastal mountain range. The average elevation of Masyaf is 485 meters. It is just west of the al-Ghab Plain. The area is marked by gardens, orchards and fields of wheat and barley which are cultivated by local residents. To the north and south of Masyaf flow seasonal streams which feed into a tributary of the Orontes River, called al-Sarout. The city of Hama is 45 kilometers to the east and Baniyas is 54 kilometers to the west. Hama is connected to the town via a road north of Masyaf which passes through al- Laqbah and Deir Shamil. Nearby villages include al-Rusafa to the southeast, al-Bayda to the south, al-Suwaydah to the southwest, Rabu to the west, Biqraqa to the northwest, Hurayf and Hayalin to the north, Zaynah to the northeast and al-Shiha to the east. Climate Masyaf has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). In winter there is much more rainfall in Masyaf than in summer. The average annual temperature in Masyaf is . About of precipitation falls annually. Demographics According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Masyaf had a population of 22,508 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the Masyaf District and the Masyaf Subdistrict. The latter had a population of 68,184 in 2004.General Census of Population and Housing 2004 . Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Hama Governorate. In the mid-1940s, its inhabitants were predominantly Ismailis. Today, it is a religiously mixed city of Ismailis and Alawites, with a Christian minority. In popular culture Masyaf is featured as the base of operations of the Assassin Order in the Assassin's Creed games series (mainly in Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed: Revelations). The village appears built on a rock, with the Masyaf fortress at the top.

Its stories revolved around aliens Calinelle (played by Lisette Anfousse) and Picabo (played by Hubert Gagnon), who both wore matching orange suits which included a mask and a mushroom-shaped headdress. The pair befriended the human Francolin upon arrival on earth. Other characters included the talking bird Couac (a puppet voiced by Gaétane Laniel) and the mechanical dog Millimagino. The show's foremost purpose was language acquisition, which was conveyed by the way the aliens used their superpowers: in order to magically accomplish difficult or impossible tasks, they would state a sentence to be repeated and then silently mouthed it while children at home were supposed to say it. Les Oraliens, unlike a contemporary children's program with a similar premise, Les 100 tours de Centour, was more about proper pronunciation than sentence construction. The show's purpose was also conveyed by the recurring bad guy, le Furotte (played by André Cartier), who always mumbled incoherently. There have been a few commentators over the years who have perceived in his speech pattern a parody of rural and working-class Quebec French, and have criticized the show as an effort to stigmatize some aspects of Québec French.

Controversy centered on the continued use of non-heat-treated blood products after the development of heat treatments that prevented the spread of infection. Some high-ranking officials in the Ministry of Health and Welfare, executives of the manufacturing company and a leading doctor in the field of haemophilia study were charged for involuntary manslaughter. Background Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS, is a communicable disease caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV. AIDS is not curable. The first recognition of the emergence of an AIDS-like disease occurred in Los Angeles in 1981. It was not until 1985 that the first cases of AIDS were officially reported in Japan. As early as 1983, however, Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare was notified by Baxter Travenol Laboratories (BTL) that it was manufacturing a new blood product, licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was heat-treated to kill HIV. BTL was interested in licensing this new product in Japan. The Japanese Green Cross Corporation (ミドリ十字), the main Japanese provider of blood products, protested that this would constitute unfair competition, as it was \\"not prepared to make heat- treated agents itself\\".Leflar, Robert B. \\"Cancer, AIDS and the Medical Information Fulcrum,\\" Japan Quarterly, vol. 44. April–June 1997. The Ministry of Health responded by ordering screening of untreated blood products, clinical trials of heat-treatments, and a campaign to increase domestic blood donations. The Green Cross Corporation meanwhile distributed letters of \\"safety assurance of unheated blood products\\" to patients, many of whom suffered from haemophilia.* Miyamoto, Masao. \\"Castration, the HIV Scandal.\\" Speech. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cambridge, Mass: April 10, 1996. AIDS spreading in Japan The first known case of infection with HIV in Japan occurred in 1979, affecting a haemophilia patient who was prescribed blood products by his doctor. A second patient was a Japanese male artist who had lived abroad for some years. Some other cases were also reported in the early 1980s and these patients were haemophilia patients or had homosexual experiences. After the intense media coverage on a HIV-positive woman who had contracted the virus through heterosexual intercourse, the disease became well known in Japan and the government ordered a study into the dispute over the safety of blood products.A Study of Awareness and Attitudes toward AIDS Among Adolescents , Hiroyoshi Nishitanedam Kagoshima University Lawsuits In May and October 1989, HIV-infected haemophiliacs in Osaka and Tokyo filed lawsuits against the Ministry of Health and Welfare and five Japanese drug companies. In 1994 two charges of attempted murder were filed against Dr. Takeshi Abe, who had headed the Health Ministry's AIDS research team in 1983; he was found not guilty in 2005. Abe resigned as vice-president of Teikyo University. In January 1996, Naoto Kan was appointed Health Minister. He assembled a team to investigate the scandal, and within a month nine files of documents related to the scandal were uncovered, despite the Ministry of Health's claims that no such documents existed. As Minister, Kan promptly admitted the Ministry's legal responsibility and formally apologised to the plaintiffs. The reports uncovered by Kan's team revealed that, after the report about the possibility of contamination, untreated blood products were recalled by the Japanese importer. However, when the importer tried to present a report to the Ministry of Health, it was told that such a report was unnecessary. The Ministry claimed that there was a \\"lack of evidence pointing to links between infection with HIV and the use of unheated blood products.\\" According to one official, \\"we could not make public a fact that could fan anxieties among patients\\" [J.E.N]. According to the files, the Ministry of Health had recommended, in 1983, that the import of untreated blood and blood products be banned, and that emergency imports of heat-treated products be allowed. A week later, however, this recommendation was withdrawn because it would \\"deal a blow\\" to Japan's marketers of untreated blood products [Updike]. In 1983 Japan imported 3.14 million litres of blood plasma from the US to produce its own blood products, as well as 46 million units of prepared blood products. These imported blood products were said to pose no risk of HIV infection, and were used in Japan until 1986. Heat-treated products had been on sale since 1985, but there was neither a recall of remaining products nor a warning about the risks of using untreated products. As a result, untreated blood preparations stored at hospitals and in patients' home refrigerators were used up; there have been cases reported in which individuals were diagnosed with haemophilia for the first time between 1985 and 1986, began treatment, and were subsequently infected with HIV, even though it was known that HIV could be transmitted in untreated blood preparations, and treated products had become available and were in use at that time. As early as 1984, several Japanese haemophiliacs were discovered to have been infected with HIV through the use of untreated blood preparations; this fact was concealed from the public. The patients themselves continued to receive \\"intentional propaganda\\" which downplayed the risks of contracting HIV from blood products, assured their safety, and promoted their use. Of some 4500 haemophiliacs in Japan, an estimated 2000 contracted HIV in the 1980s from untreated blood preparations [J.E.N]. Charges Renzo Matsushita, former head of the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau, and two of his colleagues, were found guilty of professional negligence resulting in death. Matsushita was sentenced to two years in jail. A murder charge was also brought against him. Matsushita, who after retirement became president of Green Cross, is one of at least nine former Ministry of Health bureaucrats who have retired to executive positions in Japan's blood industry since the 1980s (see ama kudari).

The school is operated by the East Side Union High School District (ESUHSD). Its namesake is the United States Declaration of Independence, which celebrated its bicentennial in the same year Independence High was established in 1976. Independence is considered a magnet school, with three specialized programs, called \\"academies\\": electronics, finance, and teaching. Later magnet programs were extended into the performing arts and space technology, which were cut in 2009 due to budget constraints. Independence students are called \\"The '76ers\\" and the mascot is named \\"Sammy the Sixer\\", who is an interpretation of an American founding father, George Washington. Population Sammy the Sixer, the Independence High School mascot, at an awards assembly in the school gymnasium, with onlooking student leaders and students. =Demographics= Out of the sixteen high schools ESUHSD operates, Independence services the largest student population, with 3,054 students as of the 2013-2014 school year. Out of these, 3.7% identified as White, 2.7% identified as African-American, 34.1% identified as Hispanic or Latino, 54.9% identified as Asian (19.0% identified as Filipino), 0.2% identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.7% identified as Pacific Islander, 0.8% gave either mixed or no response, 8.4% are students with disabilities, and 17.6% of the student population are considered English learners. =Class size= As of the 2008-2009 school year, the pupil-teacher ratio was 21.8 to 1, with 94.4% of teachers being fully credentialed; as of the same time, the full-time equivalent of Independence's teachers is 157.4. Class size at Independence is an average of 26.8 students. =Campus= Independence High School consists of over fifty buildings, each labeled with a specific letter. The four primary groups of buildings are referred to as the villas, including A-Villa (American Hall), which includes the school bank; B-Villa (Bicentennial Hall); C-Villa (Constitution Hall), which includes the disciplinary committee; and D-Villa (Democracy Hall). During the fall of 2005, E-Villa (Eagle Hall) was removed indefinitely, only to be used as the name place for all music rooms. All villas are architecturally identical and surround a concrete clock tower in the middle of the school. From 1976 to 1979, the Independence High gym hosted San Jose State University men's basketball games. Other academic structures include complexes also labeled with letters, including the G-Complex, housing art classes; M-Complex, housing industrial classes; and the P-Complex, which are portable buildings currently in use by KIPP, which runs a charter school on campus called KIPP San Jose Collegiate. Independence also shares its campus with ACE Charter High School and Pegasus High School (alternative school). Pegasus uses what used to be known as the L- Complex. ACE moved into the H-Complex and shares the K-Complex with science classes that are part of Independence. In the summer before 2014-2015, Independence's administration office moved from the H-Complex to the N-Complex when they were rebuilding it after a fire damaged the complex. Along with the new administration offices, the school built a student center that quickly became popular with the students. B-Villa's main building was also affected by a fire in 2013 and opened for the 2016-2017 school year. Along with a now-defunct planetarium, the school also houses Olympic-sized racing and diving pools, as well as an Olympic-regulation track. The Luis Valdez Center for the Performing Art went under construction in the summer of 2014. In the beginning of the 2012-2013 school year, the district gave all the high schools artificial grass fields in the stadium. Independence also contains seven tennis courts, four baseball fields, and two gymnasiums. In fall of the 2013, the city opened a brand new public library right next to the G-Complex on Educational Park drive, using funds from bond measures passed in 2002 to construct 20 new public libraries in San Jose. Extracurricular activities =Yearbook= The American was Independence High School's Columbia Scholastic Press Association Gold- and Silver Crown-winning yearbook. In 2008, Independence High School confirmed that The American would cease publication due to debt accumulation and budget problems. In 2011 the school yearbook returned, using a site called MBROSIA, the students would be able to get a hard copy of their yearbook for their friends to sign, while also getting an online yearbook. In 2012 the school started using a different program with the company, Herff Jones. In 2013, the yearbook staff, along with Carla Hansen, and Stacy Johnson, kept the yearbook on and going, with the help of Yearbook, Editor-in- Chief, Alvin Castillo Bunales. =Newspapers= Until the late 1980s, a student newspaper titled the Declaration of Independence was distributed throughout the school, though it eventually ceased publication. During the mid '80s into the 1990s the school newspaper carried the name \\"The Liberty.\\" In 2004, three student papers—including The Independent Voice, The Independent Times, and a revived Declaration of Independence—were almost simultaneously founded, though by 2006 only The Independent Voice had any significant representation in the school. During the 2009-2010 school year, the Voice was the school's sole student-run, monthly newspaper, distributed throughout the school to selected classrooms and villas. As of the 2017-2018 school year, Graham Haworth, English teacher, re-established an official school newspaper called the \\"Common Sense\\". The publication is uploaded to the school website by the journalism class.http://www.ihscommonsense.com All publication and equipment costs are funded solely through fundraisers and advertisement sales. =Band & Orchestra= Independence High School's instrumental program, led by Mr. Kenneth Ponticelli, includes Orchestra, Philharmonic Orchestra, Symphonic Band, and Wind Ensemble. Under the direction of Bob Russell and Dan Smith, the marching band started with humble beginnings. Originally competing in jeans, T-shirts, and their trademark Cavalry Stetson hat. They found early success by defeating the powerhouse, and former National Champion Emerald Regime from Live Oak High School (Morgan Hill, CA). In 1979, the 76th Cavalry band made their first trip to Whitewater, Wisconsin to compete at the Marching Band of America National Championship. Their first endeavor came fractions of points away from the title. The band vowed to return. In the Summer of 1981, they did just that. The band completed their first undefeated season by capturing the MBA National Championship Title in 1981.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIFmmn1c8ow&list;=PLlFVOClL0jkcPTADqVMlXEs0m47nbkscd&index;=2 Their repertoire was \\"Light Cavalry Overture\\"(Franz von Suppe), \\"Imaginary Voyage\\"(Jean-Luc Ponty), \\"Sud de la Ciudad Del Oro\\"(Mike Smith), \\"She Believes in Me\\"(Steve Gibb), \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\"(Aaron Copland), \\"Simple Gifts/Appalachian Spring\\" (Aaron Copland/Elder Joseph Brackett). From there, the 76th Cavalry band went on an incredible winning streak and went undefeated for three more years. There were 12 members of the 76th Cavalry Band who won the National Championship at MBA and went on to win a World Championship with the Santa Clara Vanguard at the 1981 Drum Corps International Championships in Montreal, Canada. The band made a comeback in 2005 with a show entitled \\"The Art Of War\\", placing third overall in WBA class A, AA, and AAA Championships, at Johansen High School in Modesto Ca. In 2006, the 76th Cavalry became Class AA Champion with a performance of Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony, garnering 85.85 points at preliminaries and 87.69 at the finals—the first championships the Cavalry had won since 1981. The 76th Cavalry placed fourth in the overall A/AA/AAA classification. In 2007, the 76th Cavalry became Class AA Champion once again with a score of 82.5. This allowed them to advance into finals with all other A, AA, and AAA bands, where they placed fifth overall with a score of 84.1. In 2008, the 76th Cavalry placed second in Class A with a score of 80.40, clinching High General Effect and High Auxiliary captions with their show entitled \\"The Gathering, Selection by Rachmaninoff\\". In 2009, the band again took second place with a performance of Sergei Prokofiev's music from the ballet Romeo and Juliet with a score of 85.25; also earning High Percussion. They moved onto A, AA, AAA Finals, and placed 4th overall with a score of 88.10. One of the Cavalry's highest scores ever! They also took High Auxiliary. The 76th Cavalry has also been invited to London in Winter 2009 to play in a New Year's parade. In 2015, the band's performance of Steven Reineke's composition, The Witch and the Saint took second place in Class A once again with a score of 82.65, breaking 80 for the first time in 6 years. As of the 2015 season, the Cavalry's colorguard section remains undefeated in their class (Winter season included) for three full years. In 2017, the Cavalry brought back a win as Class A Champions with a score of 83.70, the cavalry's highest score since 2009, and first win since 2007! The show was entitled \\"Elements\\" and featured the music of Brian Balmages and Gustav Holst. The Cavalry achieved the high visual award, and the colorguard captured High auxiliary, sustaining an undefeated season! The Wind Ensemble have placed first in their division in many Heritage Festivals. During spring break of 2007, the Wind Ensemble went to the New York Heritage Festival and took first in their division, along with winning an Adjudicator's Award for a score over 92, and another award for receiving the highest score of all the instrumental groups at the festival. They brought home two trophies and a plaque, along with an invitation to the 2008 Gold Festival in Boston. The Wind Ensemble has taken a Unanimous Superior in the CMEA Festivals for the past 3 years (2006, 2007, and 2008). They have also been invited to play in many places around the world, including Britain, Australia, and China. Every year, Independence High School hosts the CMEA Orchestra Festival, using both facilities: the Luis Valdez Theater and the E-Building. In 2012, the Symphony Orchestra placed Unanimous Superior. Keyboard and Vocal Music Independence High School offers Class Piano in a modern piano lab with state-of-the-art electronic piano keyboard stations for each student. Piano is available for four years. Students present an annual monster concert each spring featuring solo and ensemble works for one to ten keyboards. Piano proficiency, general musicianship, and collaboration with other instrumentalists and vocalists is a priority of the curriculum. In addition, individual students have the option to participate in the California Music Teachers Association Certificate of Merit Auditions each year. Concert Choir is the ensemble for singers at Independence.

Until Aden and al Hudaydah eclipsed it in the 19th century, Mocha was the principal port for Yemen's capital, Sanaʽa. Overview Minaret of Mocha Mosque Mocha is famous for being the major marketplace for coffee (Coffea arabica) from the 15th century until the early 18th century. Even after other sources of coffee were found, Mocha beans (also called Sanani or Mocha Sanani beans, meaning from Sana'a) continued to be prized for their distinctive flavor--and remain so even today. The coffee itself did not grow in Mocha, but was transported from places inland to the port in Mocha, where it was shipped abroad. Mocha's coffee legacy is reflected in the name of the mocha latte and the Moka pot Moka pot coffee maker. European factories at Mocha in the late 17th century According to the Portuguese Jesuit missionary Jerónimo Lobo, who sailed the Red Sea in 1625, Mocha was \\"formerly of limited reputation and trade\\" but since \\"the Turkish assumption of power throughout Arabia, it has become the major city of the territory under Turkish domination, even though it is not the Pasha's place of residence, which is two days' journey inland in the city of Sana'a.\\"Donald M. Lockhart, translator, The Itinerário of Jerónimo Lobo (London: Hakluyt Society, 1984), p.88 Lobo adds that its importance as a port was also due to the Ottoman law that required all ships entering the Red Sea to put in at Mocha and pay duty on their cargoes. History Mocha reached its zenith in the 17th century, owing to its trade in coffee. The city boasted a stone wall enclosing a citadel, as well as a labyrinth of thatched huts that surrounded the wall from without. Of these, some four hundred accommodated Jewish households that engaged in trade. Passing through Mocha in 1752 and 1756, Remedius Prutky found that it boasted a \\"lodging-house of the Prophet Muhammad, which was like a huge tenement block laid out in many hundred separate cells where accommodation was rented to all strangers without discrimination of race or religion.\\" He also found a number of European ships in the harbor: three French, four English, two Dutch, and one Portuguese.J.H. Arrowsmith-Brown, translator and editor, Prutky's Travels to Ethiopia and Other Countries (London: Hakluyt Society, 1991), pp.363f In the 18th century, a plague killed half of the city's population, from which time the city never really recovered. English, Dutch, and French companies maintained factories at Mocha, which remained a major emporium and coffee exporting port until the early 19th century. In August 1800 Phoenix visited. William Moffat, her captain, took the opportunity to prepare a chart of the mouth of the Red Sea. Mocha was very dependent on imported coffee beans from present-day Ethiopia, which was exported by Somali merchants from Berbera across the Gulf of Aden. The Berbera merchants procured most of the coffee from the environs of Harar and shipped them off in their own vessels during the Berbera trading season. 18th century French plan of Mocha, Yemen. The Somali, Jewish and European quarters are located outside the citadel. Foreign observers at the time were quick to notice the Somalis who frequented Mocha. The majority of the Somalis arrived seasonally and stayed temporarily to trade in the goods they brought from the interior of the Horn of Africa. They were noted to be industrious in trade as well as keeping to the general peace: > The Samaulies, who inhabit the whole coast from Gardafui to the Straits > [Bab-el-Mandeb], and through whose territories the whole produce of the > interior of Africa must consequently reach Arabia, have been represented by > Mr. Bruce, and many others, as a savage race, with whom it would be > dangerous to have connection.

In December 1820, HMS Topaze and ships and troops belonging to the British East India Company attacked the North and South Forts, destroying them. The action was in pursuit of British demands on the government of the city. A decade and a half later, Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt would also attack the city and destroy its fortified wall closest to the sea, as well as its citadel.Iben Safir, (vol. 1), Jacob Saphir, Lyck, 1866, pp. 110a– 111a (Hebrew) However, by that time, Mocha's trade in its country's precious commodity of coffee grains (Coffea arabica) had already been supplanted by Ethiopia which was the principal trader of this commodity to North Africa and which sold for a third of the price of the same coffee imported from Arabia.Johann Ludwig Burckhardt (John Lewis Burckhardt), Travels in Nubia 1819. Villa of the Turkish governor, late 19th century Diplomat Edmund Roberts visited Mocha in the 1830s. He noted that Turkish \\"rebels\\" possessed Mocha. The Turks took it over after they left Egypt while being disgruntled with the rule of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. These \\"rebels\\", consisting of confederates throughout Arabia, had banded together under one leader named Turkie ben al Mas. Jacob Saphir who visited the city in 1859 wrote about seeing many houses that were vacant of dwellers, although the Turkish governor still dwelt there with a band of soldiers, collecting taxes from local traders and ships visiting the harbor. When the British took control over Aden, the port in Mocha fell into disuse, being replaced by Aden. The general destruction of the city was still prominent as late as 1909, when German explorer and photographer, Hermann Burchardt, wrote of the city Mocha as he saw it: “This card will reach you from one of the most godforsaken little places in Asia. It exceeds all my expectations, with regard to the destruction. It looks like a city entirely destroyed by earthquakes, etc.”Michael Friedländer, Hermann Burchardt: Mitteilungen aus seinen letzten Briefen (Messages from his last letters), published in Journal: Ost und West (Illustrated monthly magazine for all of Judaism), issue 2 / February 1910, Berlin, p. 108 (German). Mocha was among the population centers in southern Yemen taken over by the Houthis during their military offensive in March 2015. The city was attacked by pro-Hadi forces in January 2017 and captured by pro- Hadi forces in February 2017. At present, Mocha is no longer utilized as a major trade route and the current local economy is largely based upon fishing and a small number of tourists. The village of Mocha was officially relocated west along the Red Sea shore to accommodate the building and demolition of several coastal highways.

In addition to being the third oldest high school in Oakland, it is the larger of the two high schools in West Oakland (the other being Bunche High School), and the only high school in West Oakland operated by the Oakland Unified School District. History =Early history (1915-2005)= In January 1915, McClymonds High School started in a small building formerly occupied by Oakland Technical High School. Originally, 60 students were enrolled in the school, which at that time was called Vocational High School. It was the first public school in California to offer summer school. The school was named after J.W. McClymonds, who at one time was the superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District. Ida Louise Jackson, the first black teacher in the Oakland district, taught at McClymonds before her retirement in 1953. In 1927, with $325,000 spent on additional classrooms, the school became more of a regular school than a summer school. In 1933, the legislative act was passed, regulating school building construction. This required that schools have steel and structural support on the inside. The building did not meet these requirements. The school decided to move to 14th and Myrtle Street in the same building with Lowell Junior High School. McClymonds High thereby became a four year high school. The name changed from J.W. McClymonds to Lowell McClymonds, then to McClymonds Lowell High School. Finally, in September 1938, the official name of the school became McClymonds, and it was moved to 26th and Myrtle. =McClymonds Educational Complex (2005-2010)= In 2005, McClymonds was split into three smaller schools: BEST, EXCEL, and Kizmet Academy, collectively known as McClymonds Educational Complex. =\\"Mack Is Back!\\" (2010-present)= In 2010, McClymonds Educational Complex returned to being McClymonds High School. The school's 2010-11 theme was \\"Mack is Back!\\" On September 24, 2010, the school opened a new, state-of-the-art football field, William Belford Stadium, named in honor of the late William \\"Bill\\" Belford (often called the \\"godfather\\" of McClymonds sports). McClymonds High dedicates new football field Notable events and mentions in the media Malcolm X gave a speech at McClymonds at a function sponsored by the Afro-American Association. A young Muhammad Ali also spoke at the function. The Black Panthers co-founder Huey P. Newton was in attendance.Hillard, David, Huey: The Spirit of the Panther, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2006.

Although McClymonds is separated into two schools, the sports teams are still one, with the mascot of the Warrior. On May 16, 2006, the Oakland City Council adopted a resolution, sponsored by Council Member Nancy J. Nadel (District 3), congratulating the McClymonds Football Team For Excellence in Athletics and Academics, recognizing that McClymonds High School had ranked #1 in the East Bay and Northern California as the high school with the most football players (9) attending Division I universities, under the direction of head football coach Alonzo Carter. McClymonds was the only high school in the nation that year with three Top 100 prospects, and, with only 600-650 students, ranked #1 in Northern California for Division I Signees, and ranked #2 in the State, behind Long Beach Poly, which had 5,000 students. On March 15, 2008, McClymonds achieved its first ever Division I state championship basketball win over Dominguez High School of Compton, California, 73-54, at the Arco Arena, as the culmination of their undefeated streak of 32 wins and no losses.http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_8589820 Chappell Hayes Health Center McClymonds' health center, founded by Children's Hospital doctor and UC Berkeley alumna Barbara Staggers, and named after activist Chappell Hayes, was opened in 2005. In creating the Health Center, Dr. Staggers partnered with Lisa Hardy, MD., Division Chief of Psychiatry at Children's, to ensure that mental health services would also be available to the school community.

High Commissioner to the Philippines was the title of the personal representative of the President of the United States to the Commonwealth of the Philippines during the period 1935-1946\\\\. The office was created by the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934, which provided for a period of transition from direct American rule to the complete independence of the islands on July 4, 1946. It replaced the office of Governor-General of the Philippines, who had direct executive authority. Under the Commonwealth, executive power was held by an elected Filipino President. The role of the High Commissioner was largely ceremonial. The office of High Commissioner was held by: *Frank Murphy, November 15, 1935 – December 31, 1936 *Weldon Jones, December 31, 1936 – April 26, 1937 Annual Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs *Paul V.

Sayre's tenure was interrupted by the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II. McNutt became the first United States Ambassador to the Philippines after Philippine independence in 1946. High Commissioner's Residence With the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth, Malacañan Palace was turned over to the President of the Philippines, necessitating a new home for the highest American government official in the Philippines. A new location was found along now-Roxas Boulevard and a High Commissioner's Residence was built. According to the book titled Manila Americans by Lewis Gleeck. \\"On April 1, 1937, McNutt arrived (in Manila) with Mrs. McNutt and a sixteen-year-old daughter. Since the relinquishment of Malacañang, there had been no official residence for the High Commissioner, so (Paul) McNutt moved into El Nido, the sumptuous Dewey Boulevard residence of Attorney E.A. Perkins...\\".The residence is shown in 1938 in a short film by Andre de la Varre titled Manila, Queen City of the Pacific. A video of the film was uploaded to YouTube on May 6, 2008 by travelfilmarchive. On January 2, 1942, as Japanese forces entered the city of Manila, four members of the High Commissioner's staff, Elise Flahaven, George Gray, Virginia Hewlett and Margaret Pierce, lowered the American flag that flew at the High Commissioner's headquarters, burned it and buried its ashes to prevent its capture by the Japanese. On February 22, 1945, General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area, again raised the flag at the High Commissioner's headquarters after recapturing Manila. The High Commissioner's headquarters today houses the American embassy in the Philippines. The American Residence The American Residence in Baguio The American Residence in Baguio was built to be the summer home of the High Commissioner, to replace The Mansion that was the Governor-General's summer residence and that had been turned over to the president of the Philippines upon the inauguration of the Commonwealth.

Her brief career was cut short when she died from postpartum embolism at the age of 31. She is recognized as the first known female painter to paint nude self-portraits. She was an important member of the artistic movement of modernism at the start of the twentieth century. Biography Dresden-Friedrichstadt: After Paula's birth, the Becker family moved into a house in \\"Friedrichstraße 29\\" (today \\"Friedrichstraße 46\\") Bremen: Becker's parental home 1888–1899 Becker was born and grew up in Dresden-Friedrichstadt. She was the third of seven children in her family. Her father Carl Woldemar Becker (January 31, 1841 Odessa – November 30, 1901, Bremen), the son of a Russian university professor of French, was employed as an engineer with the German railway. Her mother, Mathilde (November 3, 1852 Lübeck – January 22, 1926 Bremen) was from an aristocratic family von Bültzingslöwen, and her parents provided their children a cultured and intellectual household environment. Clara Rilke Westhoff, Paula Modersohn-Becker, 1905 In 1888 the family moved from Dresden to Bremen. While visiting a maternal aunt in London, Becker received her first instruction in drawing at St John's Wood Art School. In 1895 she was introduced to works of the artists' circle of Worpswede; Otto Modersohn, Fritz Mackensen, Fritz Overbeck and Heinrich Vogeler presented their paintings in Bremen's Art Museum, Kunsthalle Bremen. In addition to her teacher training in Bremen in 1893–1895, Becker received private instruction in painting. In 1896 she participated in a course for painting and drawing sponsored by the Verein der Berliner Künstlerinnen (Union of Berlin Female Artists) which offered art studies to women. Becker's friend Clara Westhoff left Bremen in early 1899 to study in Paris. By December of that year, Becker followed her there, and in 1900 she studied at the Académie Colarossi in the Latin Quarter. In April 1900 the great Centennial Exhibition was held in Paris. On this occasion Fritz Overbeck and his wife, along with Otto Modersohn, arrived in June. Modersohn's ailing wife Helen had been left in Worpswede and died during his trip to Paris. With this news Modersohn and the Overbecks rushed back to Germany. Otto Modersohn Sleeping, Paula Modersohn- Becker, 1906 In 1901 Paula married Otto Modersohn and became stepmother to Otto's two-year-old daughter, Elsbeth Modersohn, the child from his first marriage. She functioned in that capacity for two years, then relocated to Paris again in 1903. She and Modersohn lived mostly apart from that time forward until 1907, when she returned to Germany. In a letter to Rainer Maria Rilke written from Worpswede on February 17, 1906, signs of a troubled marriage emerge, \\"And now, I don't even know how I should sign my name, I'm not Modersohn and I'm not Paula Becker anymore either\\".\\" Less than a month later she writes from Paris to her husband, \\"try to get used to the possibility of the thought that our lives can go separate ways\\". By 1906, Becker (now known as Paula Modersohn-Becker) had reversed her previous desire to avoid having children and began an affair with a well-known Parisian \\"ladies' man\\". However, by early 1907 she returned to her husband, became pregnant, and in November delivered a daughter, Mathilde. After the pregnancy, she complained of severe leg pain, so the physician ordered bed rest. After 18 days he told her to get up and begin moving, but apparently, a thrombus had formed in her leg, and with her mobility, broke off and then caused her death within hours. Career Reclining Mother and Child In 1898, at age 22, Becker immersed herself in the artistic community of Worpswede, where artists such as Fritz Mackensen (1866–1953) and Heinrich Vogeler (1872–1942) had retreated to protest against the domination of the art academy style and life in the big city. She studied under Mackensen, painting the nearby farmers, and the northern German landscape. At this time she began close friendships with the sculptor Clara Westhoff (1875–1954) and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926). Until the years when Becker began the practice, women painters had not widely used nude females as subjects for their work. The only notable exceptions to this dearth are works by Artemisia Gentileschi, three centuries earlier; for example, art historians assume that Gentileschi used her own body as the model for her work Susannah and the Elders. Becker's work on the female nude is unconventional and expresses an ambivalence to both her subject matter and the method of its representation.see Burns, Looking as Women: The Paintings of Suzanne Valadon, Paula Modersohn-Becker and Frida Kahlo Becker was trained in the methods of realism and naturalism, along with a recognizable simplicity of form. She was able to achieve a distinct texture to her work by scratching into the wet paint. She later abandoned those techniques to move into Fauvism. There is evidence to suggest that a number of Paula Modersohn-Becker's self-portraits were influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Rossetti, including Self-portrait with a bowl and a glass (c.1904; Sander Collection), Self-portrait nude with amber necklace (1906; Private collection), and Self-portrait on my sixth wedding anniversary (1906; Museen Böttcherstrasse, Paula Modersohn- Becker Museum, Bremen).Rebecca Jelbert: \\"Paula Modersohn-Becker’s self-portraits and the influence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti.\\" The Burlington Magazine, vol.159, no.1373 (2017): 617-22. She may also have influenced one or more of Picasso's paintings, as Diane Radycki posits in her 2013 monograph on the artist.Radiograph probings of Picasso's portrait of Gertrude Stein show that he reworked the head several times, finally posturing it exactly as Modersohn-Becker had done in her portrait of Lee Hoelger (see Radycki, Paula Modersohn-Becker: The First Modern Woman Artist). Trips to Paris Rainer Maria Rilke, Paula Modersohn-Becker (1906) Until 1907 Modersohn-Becker made another six extended trips to Paris for artistic purposes, sometimes living separately from her husband, Otto. During one of her stays in Paris she took courses at the École des Beaux-Arts. She visited contemporary exhibitions often, and was particularly intrigued with the work of Paul Cézanne. Other Post-Impressionists were especially influential, including Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. Fauvism influences also appear in her works such as Poorhouse Woman with a Glass Bottle. In 1906, Modersohn-Becker left Worpswede, as well as her husband, Otto, to pursue an artistic career in Paris. In a journal entry dated February 24, 1906, a sanguine Modersohn-Becker wrote, \\"Now I have left Otto Modersohn and am standing between my old life and my new life. I wonder what the new one will be like. And I wonder what will become of me in my new life? Now whatever must be, will be.\\" Despite her sister's and mother's general disapproval of Paula's decision to leave Otto for Paris, her relocation there proved to be quite prosperous for her. It was during this time frame that she accomplished her most intensive work. From this body of work she produced a series of paintings about which she felt great excitement and satisfaction. During this period of painting, she produced her initial nude self-portraits, unprecedented for female artists, as well as portraits of her friends, including Rainer Maria Rilke and Werner Sombart. Modersohn-Becker was incredibly optimistic about her artistic progress during her final trip to Paris. In May 1906, she wrote a letter to her elder sister, Milly Rohland-Becker, in which she stated, \\"I am becoming somebody - I'm living the most intensively happy period of my life.\\" Final year and death Paula with Mathilde, November 1907 (days before Paula's death) Self-Portrait, Nude with Amber Necklace Half-Length II In 1907 Paula Modersohn-Becker returned to her husband in Worpswede, despite period correspondence that indicated her desire for independence. She wrote in detail about her love for her husband but also of her need to delay motherhood in her pursuit of artistic freedom. She continued to express ambivalence regarding motherhood as she was concerned about her ability to paint while raising a child; her diary entries indicate that she had planned on achieving a painting career by age thirty, then having children. So, when her daughter Mathilde (Tillie) Modersohn was born on November 2, 1907, Paula and Otto were joyous. The joy became tragedy nineteen days later, when Paula suddenly died. She had complained of pain in her legs after the delivery, and was advised to remain in bed. When the physician returned on 21 November, he advised her to rise. She walked a few steps, then sat down, called for the infant to be placed in her arms, complained of leg pain, and died, saying only \\"What a pity.\\" She was buried in the Worpswede Cemetery.Monument on the grave of Paula Modersohn- Becker in Worpswede cemetery, by sculptor Bernhard Hoetger (1907) Painting technique Modersohn-Becker employed the same technique throughout her short career as a painter.Hoffmeister-zur Nedden, Angelica, Zur Maltechnik von Paula Modersohn-Becker (On the painting technique of Paula Modersohn-Becker), Zeitschrift für Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung Jahrgang 11 (1997), Heft 2, pp. 286–300. She worked in tempera and oil with a limited range of pigments such as zinc white, cadmium yellow, viridian, and synthetic ultramarine.Paula Modersohn-Becker, Portrait of an Old Lady in the Garden, ColourLex. Legacy By 1899 Clara Westhoff had made a bust of Modersohn-Becker, saying that it was a symbol of their friendship and shared passion for art. In 1908 Rainer Maria Rilke wrote the renowned poem \\"Requiem for a Friend\\" in Modersohn-Becker's memory. In 1927 the businessman Ludwig Roselius opened in Bremen the Paula Modersohn-Becker Museum, designed by Bernhard Hoetger. Local Nazis denounced its art and architecture in 1935,Das Schwarze Korps; 24/10/1935; pages 11,34 but Roselius ignored this until Hitler denounced his entire Böttcherstraße in September 1936. After Roselius's secretary Barbara Goette intervened on his behalf with Hitler, the Nazi leader allowed the street's buildings to remain as a monument of \\"degenerate art\\".Ludwig Roselius: Ein Nachruf von Barbara Götte, Bremisches Jahrbuch, 1951, www.brema.suub.uni- bremen.de/periodical/pageview/62875 viewed on 26/3/2016 Mathilde Modersohn (1907–1998) founded the Paula Modersohn-Becker Foundation (Paula Modersohn- Becker-Stiftung) in 1978. In 1988 a stamp with the portrait of Paula Modersohn-Becker was issued in the series Women in German history by the German post-office authority Deutsche Bundespost. Paula Modersohn-Becker was not widely known at the time of her untimely death, and would have dropped into obscurity but for her voluminous writing. She maintained a diary, and corresponded regularly with friends in her artistic circle. Her letters were collected and widely published (in German) during the 1920s,The collected letters were published by noted publisher Kurt Wolff, who had also published Franz Kafka. and it was largely through them that her legacy was maintained. In the 1970s, US art historian Diane Radycki first translated them into English (they have also been translated by others since then). Two-thirds of the correspondence occurred from age 16 to the early years of her marriage, and it is full of youthful optimism and energy. On the 8th of February 2018 Becker's birthday was celebrated in a Google Doodle. Modersohn-Becker was included in the 2018 exhibit Women in Paris 1850-1900. =Paula Becker House= Modersohn-Becker's house in Bremen, where she spent much of her life, opened in October 2007 as a private art museum and gallery. Her family moved from Dresden to Bremen in 1888 and lived in this house. Becker lived here until 1899, when she was 23 years old, and set up her first studio in this house. There was an active artist community in Bremen and via Becker's mother's friendships in the art world, Paula grew to be part of the community. Apart from her teacher training in Bremen in 1893–1895, Paula took private instruction in painting. It was not well known that the young Becker had lived here for ten years; in 2003 Heinz and Betty Thies bought the then run-down house, and had it restored in time for the 100th anniversary of the artist's death. At that time (November 2007) it was turned into a public museum. In popular culture The life of Paula Modersohn-Becker is fictionalized in Sue Hubbard's 2012 novel, Girl in White. She was also the subject of a 2016 German biographical film called Paula.

Isaac Asimov was one of the most prolific writers in the past century, known for his many science fiction and non-fiction works. His 'guide' series is one of his scholarly contributions to the world's understanding of literature. For instance, Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare and Asimov's Guide to the Bible, both prominent in this series, are reliable and easily understood guides which are still used in college level courses on both subjects. Along with these serious works, he also maintains a human quality; one which he lets run free in Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor and its sequel, Asimov Laughs Again. In these two books, he tells a broad variety of jokes—from puns to ethnic, from limericks to anecdotes. The latter book, it may be noted, is replete with sexually-explicit humor. What makes these books surpass many of their contemporaries is that he explains what is funny to the jokes, and gives tips on how to tell them. He talks about the effect of the jokes on different audiences, and the personal touches that you can add to make the joke your own. Treasury of Humor is unique in that in addition to being a working joke book, it is a treatise on the theory of humor, propounding Asimov's theory that the essence of humor is an abrupt, jarring change in emphasis and/or point of view, moving from the crucial to the trivial, and/or from the sublime to the ridiculous.  Related work  Asimov also wrote a short story, Jokester, in which a character wonders where the jokes come from, since so many people say \\"I heard a good one\\", but never \\"I invented a good one\\". His investigation will lead him to think that jokes are of alien origin and designed to study the psychology of earthlings.

Bodor ran the final 800 metres of the 1,600 metre race, following Pál Simon, Frigyes Wiesner, and József Nagy. In the first round, Bodor began his leg three yards behind the Swedish team and had to pass the other runner just to remain in competition. The time for the team in that round was 3:32.6. The final saw a reversal of fortune, however, as the American team was dominant. Bodor began with a five-yard lead over the Germans, however. He was unable to hold on to that lead, and finished inches behind the Germans at 3:32.5 to his opponents' 3:32.4 to receive a bronze rather than silver. In the 800 metres, Bodor won his first round heat with a time of 1:58.6 to defeat a number of highly regarded athletes including defending champion James Lightbody. Bodor was one of four runners to beat Lightbody's record of 1:56.0 in the final, though he was the slowest of the four at 1:55.4. Bodor also competed in the 1500 metres, though he did not advance past the first round. His heat in that round was full of capable athletes, including defending champion Lightbody (the defending champion in that event as well) and the winner of the heat, James P. Sullivan.

Nominations were submitted to lieutenant governors and territorial commissioners, senators, members of parliament, provincial governments, the Public Service Commission of Canada, the Canadian Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and various federal government departments, as well as organizations throughout the country, and some 42,000 medals were awarded. The medal's design was approved by the Canadian monarch, Elizabeth II. It is in the form of a diameter, rhodium plated copper and zinc alloy disc with, on the obverse, the image of the Royal Cypher surmounted by a St. Edward's Crown (symbolising the sovereign as fount of honour) all superimposed on a large single maple leaf and circumscribed with the words CONFEDERATION • CONFÉDÉRATION above and the years 1867 — 1992 below. The medal's reverse shows the shield of the Royal Arms of Canada encircled by the motto ribbon of the Order of Canada and ensigned by the crest of the Canadian arms (a crowned lion holding a maple leaf in the right front paw), all above the country's national motto, A MARI USQUE AD MARE.

It is often stated in dual form for comonads. It is sometimes called the Beck tripleability theorem because of the older term triple for a monad. Beck's monadicity theorem asserts that a functor :U: C \\\\to D is monadic if and only if # U has a left adjoint; # U reflects isomorphisms; and # C has coequalizers of U-split parallel pairs (those parallel pairs of morphisms in C, which U sends to pairs having a split coequalizer in D), and U preserves those coequalizers. There are several variations of Beck's theorem: if U has a left adjoint then any of the following conditions ensure that U is monadic: *U reflects isomorphisms and C has coequalizers of reflexive pairs (those with a common right inverse) and U preserves those coequalizers. (This gives the crude monadicity theorem.) *Every fork in C which is by U sent to a split coequalizer sequence in D is itself a coequalizer sequence in C. In different words, U creates (preserves and reflects) U-split coequalizer sequences. Another variation of Beck's theorem characterizes strictly monadic functors: those for which the comparison functor is an isomorphism rather than just an equivalence. For this version the definitions of what it means to create coequalizers is changed slightly: the coequalizer has to be unique rather than just unique up to isomorphism. Beck's theorem is particularly important in its relation with the descent theory, which plays a role in sheaf and stack theory, as well as in the Alexander Grothendieck's approach to algebraic geometry. Most cases of faithfully flat descent of algebraic structures (e.g. those in FGA and in SGA1) are special cases of Beck's theorem. The theorem gives an exact categorical description of the process of 'descent', at this level. In 1970 the Grothendieck approach via fibered categories and descent data was shown (by Jean Bénabou and Jacques Roubaud) to be equivalent (under some conditions) to the comonad approach. In a later work, Pierre Deligne applied Beck's theorem to Tannakian category theory, greatly simplifying the basic developments. Examples *It follows from Beck's theorem that the forgetful functor from compact Hausdorff spaces to sets is monadic. The left adjoint is the Stone–Čech compactification, the forgetful functor preserves all colimits, and it reflects isomorphisms because any continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism. shows that this adjunction is in fact the initial monadic adjunction extending the (non- monadic) inclusion functor of the category of finite sets into the one of all sets. *The forgetful functor from topological spaces to sets is not monadic as it does not reflect isomorphisms: continuous bijections between (non-compact or non-Hausdorff) topological spaces need not be homeomorphisms. * shows that the functor from commutative C*-algebras to sets sending such an algebra A to the unit ball, i.e., the set \\\\\\\\{a \\\\in A, \\\\a\\\\ \\\\le 1 \\\\\\\\}, is monadic. Negrepontis also deduces Gelfand duality, i.e., the equivalence of categories between the opposite category of compact Hausdorff spaces and commutative C*-algebras can be deduced from this. *The powerset functor from Setop to Set is monadic, where Set is the category of sets. More generally Beck's theorem can be used to show that the powerset functor from Top to T is monadic for any topos T, which in turn is used to show that the topos T has finite colimits. *The forgetful functor from semigroups to sets is monadic. This functor does not preserve arbitrary coequalizers, showing that some restriction on the coequalizers in Beck's theorem is necessary if one wants to have conditions that are necessary and sufficient. *If B is a faithfully flat commutative ring over the commutative ring A, then the functor T from A modules to B modules taking M to B⊗AM is a comonad. This follows from the dual of Becks theorem, as the condition that B is flat implies that T preserves limits, while the condition that B is faithfully flat implies that T reflects isomorphisms. A coalgebra over T turns out to be essentially a B-module with descent data, so the fact that T is a comonad is equivalent to the main theorem of faithfully flat descent, saying that B-modules with descent are equivalent to A-modules.

At the Olympic trials held at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, in June 1908, he established the North American record for the 1500 meters of 4:01.2, besting the then Olympic record of 4:05.4. At the summer Olympics held in London in July 1908, owing to the English system of a blind draw for the preliminary heats, he was paired in the 2nd heat with America's other best miler, Mel Sheppard. Nauseated by an upset stomach just before the heat, Halstead was unable to produce his customary final sprint and lost the heat by a yard to Sheppard in a time of 4:05, thus disqualifying him for the finals. Sheppard went on to win the gold in a time of 4:03.4. Halstead upheld the American team's reputation for good sportsmanship by never uttering a word of complaint about the English system of a blind draw. In the 800 metres, held a week later, Halstead won his first round heat with a time of 2:01.4. He then placed sixth in the final. He graduated from Cornell University the same year with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. During the latter part of 1908 and 1909 he was one of the engineers who worked on the construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in New York City.

It was in effect from December 1973 to August 1975.  Background and drafting  On December 16, 1971, the day Bahrain formally became independent of the United Kingdom (Bahrain technically gained its independence earlier in the year, on August 15), Shaykh Isa ibn Salman announced that the country would have a constitutional form of government. Six months later, he issued a decree providing for the election of representatives to a Constituent Assembly, charged with drafting and ratifying a constitution. The assembly was to consist of twenty-two elected delegates plus twenty additional members, including eight delegates appointed by the emir and the twelve members at the time of the Council of Ministers. The election, which was held in December 1972, was the first national election in Bahrain's history. The electorate was restricted to native-born male citizens aged twenty years and older. The relative openness of political debate permitted during the election campaign for the twenty-two contested Constituent Assembly seats encouraged individuals dissatisfied with the lack of democratic rights to demand more civil liberties. The primary focus of concern was the 1965 Law of Public Security, a series of three emiri decrees that authorized the ruler to maintain indefinitely a virtual state of emergency in order to protect national security from suspected foreign and domestic enemies. A group of mostly university-educated professionals, led by Abd al Aziz Shamlan, unsuccessfully petitioned the emir to rescind the law's harshest provisions, especially those pertaining to arrest and detention. They believed these measures had been used arbitrarily to silence dissent and peaceful opposition. Several women's groups also organized to protest the exclusion of women from the franchise. They presented a petition to the emir requesting support for extending voting rights to female citizens, but they failed to receive a positive response. The Constituent Assembly was in session during most of 1973 drafting the constitution.  The Constitution  The constitution, enacted by emiri decree in December 1973, contained 108 articles. It provided for an advisory legislative body, the National Assembly, consisting of thirty members elected for four-year terms, plus all the members of the Council of Ministers whose terms were not fixed, as ex officio members. The assembly was not empowered to initiate or enact legislation, but it was authorized to give advice and consent to laws proposed by the Council of Ministers. The assembly had the right to question individual ministers about policies and to withdraw confidence from any minister except the prime minister. The constitution stipulated that the emir could dissolve the assembly at his discretion, provided he make public the grounds for so doing. If the assembly were dissolved by decree, new elections had to take place within two months or the dissolution would be invalidated and the dismissed members reinstated.  Election under the 1973 Constitution and suspension of the 1973 Constitution  The 1973 Bahraini general election was the only election held under the 1973 Constitution. The emir dissolved the National Assembly in August 1975, citing its inability to cooperate with the government. Although the constitution stipulated that new elections had to take place within two months of a dissolution, this did not occur. One year later, in August 1976, Shaykh Isa ibn Salman announced that the National Assembly would remain dissolved indefinitely.

Both appeared, alongside several other important theorems, in a well-known paper by József Beck. The two results described below primarily concern lower bounds on the number of lines determined by a set of points in the plane. (Any line containing at least two points of point set is said to be determined by that point set.) Erdős–Beck theorem The Erdős–Beck theorem is a variation of a classical result by L. M. Kelly and W. O. J. Moser involving configurations of n points of which at most n − k are collinear, for some 0 < k < O(). They showed that if n is sufficiently large, relative to k, then the configuration spans at least kn − (1/2)(3k + 2)(k − 1) lines. Elekes and Csaba Toth noted that the Erdős–Beck theorem does not easily extend to higher dimensions. Take for example a set of 2n points in R3 all lying on two skew lines. Assume that these two lines are each incident to n points. Such a configuration of points spans only 2n planes. Thus, a trivial extension to the hypothesis for point sets in Rd is not sufficient to obtain the desired result. This result was first conjectured by Erdős, and proven by Beck. (See Theorem 5.2 in.) =Statement= Let S be a set of n points in the plane. If no more than n − k points lie on any line for some 0 ≤ k < n − 2, then there exist Ω(nk) lines determined by the points of S. =Proof= Beck's theorem Beck's theorem says that finite collections of points in the plane fall into one of two extremes; one where a large fraction of points lie on a single line, and one where a large number of lines are needed to connect all the points. Although not mentioned in Beck's paper, this result is implied by the Erdős–Beck theorem.Beck's Theorem can be derived by letting k = n(1 − 1/C) and applying the Erdős–Beck theorem. =Statement= The theorem asserts the existence of positive constants C, K such that given any n points in the plane, at least one of the following statements is true: # There is a line which contains at least n/C of the points. # There exist at least n^2/K lines, each of which contains at least two of the points. In Beck's original argument, C is 100 and K is an unspecified constant; it is not known what the optimal values of C and K are. = Proof = A proof of Beck's theorem can be given as follows. Consider a set P of n points in the plane. Let j be a positive integer. Let us say that a pair of points A, B in the set P is j-connected if the line connecting A and B contains between 2^j and 2^{j+1}-1 points of P (including A and B). From the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem, the number of such lines is O( n^2 / 2^{3j} + n / 2^j ), as follows: Consider the set P of n points, and the set L of all those lines spanned by pairs of points of P that contain at least 2^j points of P. Since no two points can lie on two distinct lines L \\\\cdot {2^j \\\\choose 2} \\\\leq {n \\\\choose 2}. Now using Szemerédi–Trotter theorem, it follows that the number of incidences between P and L is at most O(n^2/2^{2j} + n). All the lines connecting j-connected points also lie in L, and each contributes at least 2^j incidences. Therefore the total number of such lines is O(n^2/2^{3j} + n/2^j). Since each such line connects together \\\\Omega( 2^{2j} ) pairs of points, we thus see that at most O( n^2 / 2^j + 2^j n ) pairs of points can be j-connected. Now, let C be a large constant. By summing the geometric series, we see that the number of pairs of points which are j-connected for some j satisfying C \\\\leq 2^j \\\\leq n/C is at most O( n^2 / C). On the other hand, the total number of pairs is \\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}. Thus if we choose C to be large enough, we can find at least n^2 / 4 pairs (for instance) which are not j-connected for any C \\\\leq 2^j \\\\leq n/C. The lines that connect these pairs either pass through fewer than 2C points, or pass through more than n/C points. If the latter case holds for even one of these pairs, then we have the first conclusion of Beck's theorem. Thus we may assume that all of the n^2 / 4 pairs are connected by lines which pass through fewer than 2C points. But each such line can connect at most C(2C-1) pairs of points. Thus there must be at least n^2 / 4C(2C-1) lines connecting at least two points, and the claim follows by taking K = 4C(2C-1).

Early life Born in Stolp, Germany (now, as part of Poland, called Słupsk), as the 7th of 8 children born to Werner (an anti-Nazi Lutheran minister) and Toni de Boor in 1937, he fled in 1945 with his family, settling eventually in Schwerin, then part of East Germany. As a child, he was often ill, suffering from a variety of conditions. In 1955, young Carl took advantage of the temporary political thaw following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, obtained a 1-month visa to West Germany and biked there, then decided to stay when he learned there that his application to Humboldt University (in East Berlin) for the study of chemistry had been turned down (because of his poor performance in mathematics). However, Otto Friedrich (a brother of Carl's father's first wife) was willing and able to help him. Two years later, he met and fell in love with Otto's niece, Matilda Friedrich, the daughter of Carl Friedrich, the political scientist and constitutional scholar. With the support of the Friedrich family, Carl emigrated to the United States in 1959, learning English on his trip across the Atlantic (he could read Beatrix Potter when he boarded the boat). Education and career Having earned only a high school diploma after 3 and a half years of study at Hamburg University, de Boor entered Harvard as a graduate student of mathematics. After working for a year as a research assistant to Garrett Birkhoff, he went to work for General Motors Research in Warren, Michigan, where he met splines. He received his first postgraduate degree, a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, in 1966, and then became an assistant professor at Purdue University. In 1972, he accepted a position as professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, working out of the UW's Army Math Research Center, which had recently been bombed in opposition to the Vietnam War. Research and teaching A chief attraction of the UW job was the opportunity to work directly with Isaac Schoenberg, considered the father of splines, the piecewise polynomials de Boor would further develop. In particular, he formulated a relatively fast and numerically stable algorithm for calculating the values of splines (used extensively in computer-aided design and computer graphics), and advocated for the formulation of spline functions in terms of the basis splines, or B-splines developed by Schoenberg and Curry. He was a teacher, guiding numerous graduate students. He is the author of a number of works, including an introductory textbook on numerical analysis (with S.D. Conte) and a textbook on spline approximation. Carl has also worked with MATLAB extensively over the years and is the author of the Spline Toolbox. Carl de Boor retired from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2003 and relocated to the Pacific Northwest, where he continues to work with colleagues on mathematical problems, and to travel. He currently lives on Orcas Island, in Washington state, with his second wife, Helen Bee, author of texts in human development, to whom he has been married since 1991. In addition to his emeritus status at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, he is also an affiliated professor at the University of Washington. de Boor has been listed as an ISI Highly Cited Author in Mathematics by the ISI Web of Knowledge, Thomson Scientific Company.ISI Highly Cited Author - Carl R. de Boor Awards In 1997 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and he received the 2003 National Medal of Science in mathematics.National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science Other honors have included election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1987 and the National Academy of Engineering in 1993, honorary degrees from Purdue University and Technion (the Israel Institute of Technology), as well as membership in the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in Germany and the Polish Academy of Science. He won the John von Neumann Lecture Prize from the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 1996 and the John A. Gregory Award of Geometric Design in 2009. Personal Carl is a lover of music—especially classical, and more especially Johann Sebastian Bach—walks, good food, and games of all sorts. In 1981, he bought his first personal computer, an Apple II with 32KB of memory with an old reel-to-reel tape recorder hooked up to store programs. He required his children to write any computer games they wished to play. With them he wrote an accounting program for tracking his checkbook, which he kept using long after the kids went to college, though he had to edit the program to use the Z key for recording a new transaction when the R key finally wore out, as well as implementations of a number of his children's favorite board games. He is a lover of the quirky and easily enthralled by art. He used to keep a print of The Garden of Earthly Delights in his dining room, to the distress of some of his children, and others. Carl learned to play the cornet, as a child, to combat asthma. He was also fed a vast quantity of raw eggs, whipped with a sprinkle of sugar, supposedly to help strengthen him during his early, sickly years. As a father, he made his children eat such egg treats. During his Madison years, he played the bass drum in the neighborhood Fourth of July parade, and each August celebrates his arrival in the United States, where he is a citizen.

It was produced by the Gonzo animation studio. Burst Angel takes place in the near future, after a rise in criminal activity forced the Japanese government to allow citizens to possess firearms and establish the Recently Armed Police of Tokyo (RAPT). The series follows a band of four mercenaries, named Jo, Meg, Sei, and Amy. The series aired on TV Asahi from April 6, 2004 to September 14, 2004, totaling 24 episodes. An original video animation, Burst Angel Infinity, was released on March 23, 2007. The music for both the series and OVA was composed by Masara Nishida. Plot In the near future, due to an unusual rise in criminal activity, it has become legal to possess firearms in Japan so lawful citizens can protect themselves. At the same time, the government established the Recently Armed Police of Tokyo, whose methods are exterminating criminals rather than arresting them. The story opens with Kyohei Tachibana, a student at a culinary arts school with dreams of someday becoming a pastry chef, motorcycling down an inner city street and becoming caught up in a shoot-out between a mysterious silver- haired woman and a psycho gangster. Kyohei escapes unharmed and ends up working as a cook for Jo, Meg, Amy, and Sei in an effort to gather up enough money to travel to France. The girls, ranging in ages of eleven to nineteen, turn out to be pseudo-mercenary agents for a larger international group known as Bailan. Burst Angel focuses on the group as they investigate a series of mutated human monsters with glowing brains that cause various amounts of mayhem in Tokyo. Characters =Main= ; : :Jo is the muscle of the group, as well as the pilot of Django, which she uses to carry out various missions for Sei and to help out her friends when they're in need, mainly Meg. Jo also puts Meg over anything else, which she stated when telling Meg that she fights for her. It is heavily implied throughout the series that she has romantic feelings for Meg. When she is not fighting, she enjoys watching horror or gore related movies. Jo would eventually rediscover her past as a genetically engineered war machine in human form. After being forced to surrender with Meg and others held hostage, Jo returns to the secret labs for reprogramming and conditioning at Hinode. Jo's counterpart, Maria, frees her and Meg to prove who was the strongest by re-staging the fight they were unable to finish in their past. After the fight between Maria and Jo, which pushes both of them to their limits, Maria loses her will to fight and is restored to her true humanity. Reunited with the group, Jo decides that she has to destroy RAPT. Against Meg's will, who is highly opposed to the idea after seeing her go through a lifetime of combat, Jo knocks Meg out for her own safety, bids her farewell, and leaves her jacket behind for her to remember her by. ADR Director Christopher Bevins comments that Jo is \\"like a female cross between Clint Eastwood and Wolverine\\". ; : :Meg has red hair (although in her first appearance chronologically in episode 14: \\"Wild Kids\\", she is portrayed as having black hair due to the monochrome setting) and dresses like a cowgirl. She carries a small revolver, and, at times, a large anti-tank rifle. Meg is highly prone to be captured, only to be rescued by Jo. She is the very best of friends with Jo and is 100% loyal only to her. Meg was once an orphan in New York City with several other children until she encountered Jo. Since then, Meg and Jo partnered and became bounty hunters together. Her personality is one of the main differences between anime and manga, while the anime tries to keep her relationship with Jo on the verge of friendly affection and subtle subtext, the manga prequel quite openly shows that Meg is experiencing a sexual attraction to her friend, fantasizing about their sex or even openly trying to seduce Jo. The other children appeared to have been adopted by a police officer. After she finds out Jo's origin, she feels that Jo should no longer fight. Jo however knocks her out and leaves her jacket with her. At the end of the series, Meg makes her way to the ruined RAPT HQ and sees Jo's scarf tied on a piece of debris. Meg then says her final goodbye to Jo. The final scene shows Meg in Jo's outfit, in a scene very much paralleling the beginning of the opening titles, only with an Orange Django behind her. In the Newtype magazine article, Meg is the \\"'spunky act now, ask questions later' gal\\" and that voice actor Jamie Marchi \\"brilliantly captured Meg's What-ever attitude\\". ; : :She is the kind leader of the group who hires Jo and Meg to become members of Bailan. She wears a long blue jacket and her black hair in a bun. Sei's grandfather runs Bailan and comes from a very powerful Chinese family. Sei was born and raised as a traditional Chinese girl and was trained in various ways of her clan/syndicate. After her grandfather stepped down as leader of the clan, their current clan members made a partnership with RAPT to preserve their clan. However, such actions not only disgusted Sei, she was also forced to do many things for RAPT in Bailan's name. She eventually rebelled against her own organization under the advice of her grandfather. Along with Jo she was caught in the explosion after destroying RAPT HQ and is presumably dead. In the Newtype magazine article, Bevins comments that Sei's character is cold, business-like, and notes that Clarine Harp's personality of sarcastic exterior, but most caring and fiercely loyal interior, \\"that's Sei to a T\\". ; : :A young genius in computer and technology. She was saved and recruited by Sei after her hacking drew attention from the authorities in her own country. It was through her hacking skills that Sei managed to recruit Jo and Meg. She often argues with Meg in a friendly way and loves scarfing down Kyohei's various treats. Her hair is light brown, and worn in pigtails. Amy's often seen carrying a pink stuffed animal that contains a laptop. In the Newtype magazine article, Bevins comments that \\"while Amy is just as brainy as Conan\\" (the title character in Case Closed, and also voiced by Retzloff), \\"she has a prissy, snotty demeanor that would give the young detective a migraine\\". =Supporting characters= ; : :He is Django's mechanic. Leo hates that Jo plays rough with Django and that Meg annoys him when he's working. He has trouble controlling his urges to act like a child as seen when the team goes to Fortune Island Artificial Beach resort. There, he smashes a go-kart out of the raceway and down the street. Despite being the team's mechanic, he has seen combat on several occasion wielding a pair of sub-machine guns. ; : :A loud-mouthed, bike-riding police officer from Osaka. Takane is often seen riding a chopper and wears a uniform resembling that of a schoolgirl. She carries a large wooden sword, which she swings around often as it symbolizes her leadership of an all girl biker gang who often act as her deputies. She's also efficient at throwing handcuffs and subduing her target. Takane is quick to lose her temper and hates being in debt to anyone. She is also the daughter of the Police Chief of Osaka. After crossing paths with the team however, she becomes attached to the team and assists them any way she can as a debt to Jo even if it means disobeying her father. ; : :A student attending a certified culinary school who is proficient in French, Chinese, Italian and Japanese cooking. Kyohei is often seen wearing his chef uniform and riding a small motor scooter which is destroyed by Jo on two occasions. He is hired by Sei as a cook for the girls because their last cook had left. He continues working for the team to earn money to go to France and try becoming a pastry chef. =Antagonists= ;Ishihara : :The governor of Tokyo and the founder of RAPT. Though he puts on the act of wanting to restore the city as a peaceful crime- free capital, in truth, he relies on ruthless methods for executing criminals and blames other companies and businesses for his shortcomings. Ishihara also makes a deal with Azuma Iriki that he would get total control of Osaka if he agreed to help the governor take over. He explains to Chief Katsu in \\"Tsutenkaku Tower, Drenched in Tears\\" that he established RAPT due to his jealousy over Osaka's less toxic community. After many scuffles with Jo's team, Glenford tries to kill Ishihara by trapping him inside a building and using a bomb to destroy it, after which, Glenford replaces him as governor. As it turns out, Ishihara actually survives the explosion and is mutated into a zombie-like beast. During his time as a mutant, Ishihara attackes the underground railways, burning for revenge against Glenford. After emerging from his iron grave, the Ishihara battles Bailan's forces in an organic mech form. After a short yet violent battle, Jo uses Django to kill the zombie. ;Ricky Glenford : :The leader of RAPT. He organized the creation of the \\"Genocide Angels\\" program which leads to the creation of Jo, Maria, and others like them. After organizing the assassination of Ishihara, he takes control of Tokyo and puts it under martial law. His true identity turns out to be a glowing brain placed in a cyborg body. ;Maria : :She is a bio-weapon like Jo, but with even stronger and more violent tendencies. While Jo is more efficient with guns, Maria relies more on bladed weapons such as swords and cutting wire. In the past, both she and Jo were the remaining fighters in a combat exercise to determine the Syndicate's \\"Genocide Angel.\\" Maria won by default, but as Jo was only rendered unconscious, Maria never felt like she truly defeated Jo. When Jo is captured by RAPT, Maria disobeys orders and kidnaps Meg to lure Jo into one final battle. She lures Jo onto an aircraft carrier similar to the one where Genocide Angel exercise was held. After a hand-to- hand battle, Jo won and Maria lost her will to fight. She asks Jo what she can do after she gains her humanity; Jo only tells her to live on. She then reunites Jo with Meg only to be surrounded by new RAPT Cybots. She tells Meg to escape with Jo while she fights off the new mechs and appears to have been shot dead. =Other characters= ;Jei Kokuren : :A representative from Kokuren and Bailan's Japanese counterpart. His father and Sei's grandfather arrange for him and Sei to wed so that the white and black lotus can join together once again. However, Sei's grandfather respectfully declines Jei's request to have both the Bai Lan and Kokuren seals displayed together. Angry, he and his men attack Sei to try to obtain the Bai Lan seal by force. Jei obtains the seal and almost escapes, but he is stopped by Jo after shooting down the dragon head of the yacht making it crash onto Jei's boat. ;Chief Katsu : :The Chief is a well-respected man in Osaka with a great sense of honor and justice. Despite looking like he doesn't care for his daughter, Takane, he actually shows great concern for her. He shows great disgust towards the government of Tokyo and further towards Glenford and RAPT. ;Sam :A police officer that Meg robbed when she was younger. Based on flashbacks, it is implied that Sam once had a family (a wife and daughter), that are now dead as he carries around his daughter's doll with him. He saves Charlie and Shirley from falling debris at the area Jo was fighting Lava, one of the \\"Genocide Angel\\" candidates. Afterward, he adopts all three children while Meg and Jo leave their own way. ;The Orphans :There are four orphans, the eldest of whom is Meg. The next oldest is Dorothy, an African-American girl who usually aids Meg in her thefts. Then Charlie, a young Caucasian boy who is usually left to care for Shirley when Meg and Dorothy leave. He is the most cynical of the group. And finally, Shirley, a mute little girl and the youngest of the group. She is the one who finds an unconscious Jo and decides to take her home with them. She carries a book with a picture of an angel with silver hair; something she always points out to everyone and especially towards Jo who she shows great affection for. ;Akio : :An old friend and classmate of Kyohei who always defended him. He is found on the streets by Eiji, a Yakuza member. He takes Akio in and has a doctor convert him into a Cyberoid. He goes on a one man war against the Yakuza. Eiji agrees to a deal with the right-hand man of the Yakuza boss to kill Akio. Eiji fails and ends up being shot several times by an enraged Akio due his betrayal. He tells Kyohei what happened to him and how he became a Cyberoid. After killing off the Yakuza and the Boss, Akio battles Eiji now being converted to a Cyberoid. Akio kills Eiji though he dies in the process leaving Kyohei crying at the loss of his friend. ;Lover : :She is a bio-weapon along with Maria and Jo. Lover is one of the final three survivors in the \\"Genocide Angel\\" training exercise (which occurred before Jo is found by Shirley). During the exercise, she almost kills Jo and Maria with missiles from a fighter plane she hot- wired, but is countered by Jo, and ultimately defeated by Maria. However, all three survive the ordeal. She is then sent by the Syndicate to retrieve Jo, but fails. Media =Anime= The complete collection of DVDs from Funimation have been released as of January 2, 2009. This DVD set includes episodes 1–24 and the OVA. The complete collection was later released on Blu- ray on September 29, 2009. The entire series, except the OVA, is also available on PlayStation Network's Video store. =Manga= A prequel to the Burst Angel TV series was created as a manga series titled Angel's Adolescence, it was written and illustrated by Minoru Murao. It was serialization in Media Works' shōnen manga magazine Dengeki Comic Gao! in 2004 and then released as three bound volumes in Japan by Media Works in 2005. The manga is a canonical prequel, and has differences from the anime, depicting the romantic relationship of Jo and Meg. In 2008 Tokyopop licensed the manga for release in English, and the first volume was released on September 9, 2008. =OVA= Burst Angel Infinity was released in Japan on March 23, 2007. Unlike Angel's Adolescence, the OVA deals is a side story revolving around Jo and Meg visiting Sam and her old gang in New York explaining the aftermath of episode 14 of the TV series. The OVA also includes a short preview titled by Ugetsu Hakua showing the characters five years in the future, including Jo, Sei and Maria alive. The OVA was released by FUNimation on November 13, 2007.

Debt in Athenian society  Under the pre-existing legal status, according to the account of the Constitution of the Athenians attributed to Aristotle, debtors unable to repay their creditors would surrender their land to them, then becoming hektemoroi, i.e. serfs who cultivated what used to be their own land and gave one sixth of produce to their creditors. Should the debt exceed the perceived value of debtor's total assets, then the debtor and his family would become the creditor's slaves as well. The same would result if a man defaulted on a debt whose collateral was the debtor's personal freedom.  Seisachtheia reforms  The seisachtheia laws immediately cancelled all outstanding debts, retroactively emancipated all previously enslaved debtors, reinstated all confiscated serf property to the hektemoroi, and forbade the use of personal freedom as collateral in all future debts. The laws instituted a ceiling to maximum property size – regardless of the legality of its acquisition (i.e. by marriage), meant to prevent excessive accumulation of land by powerful families.

Occasionally, weddellite partially dehydrates to whewellite, forming excellent pseudomorphs of grainy whewellite after weddellite's short tetragonal dipyramids. It was first described in 1942. Structural properties Weddellite, or calcium oxalate dihydrate, crystallises in a tetragonal system: the classic crystal shape is the eight- face bipyramid. Using bright field microscopy, the weddellite crystals are recognised easily by their shape, reminiscent of a postal envelope. More complex shapes of weddellite are possible; the dumbbell shape is not rare and has no precise angles or sides. This form is, in reality, a microcrystalline agglomerate that takes the shape of a biconcave disc. Weddellite crystals are poorly birefringent and do not show any interference pattern under polarised light. Biological role Weddellite crystals are usually of little clinical value. Together, whewellite and weddellite are the most common renal calculi. Occurrence Weddellite occurs as authigenic crystals in sea floor mud. It also has been reported in peat bearing sediments and in calcite-bearing lacustrine sediments. It occurs with whewellite, urea, phosphammite and aphthitalite.

Southampton was laid down at Norfolk, Virginia as a side wheel steamer in October 1841, but her machinery proved to be unsatisfactory and was removed. Apparently purchased by the United States Government in 1845, the ship was commissioned on 27 May 1845, Lieutenant Henry W. Morris in command. Service history =Africa Squadron, 1845–1846= The ship departed Norfolk on 27 June 1845 and sailed for the coast of Africa where she served as a store ship for the cruisers of the Africa Squadron. Southampton returned to Hampton Roads on 16 December 1846 and was repaired at the Norfolk Navy Yard. On 29 November 1846, she rescued the crew of the British merchant ship Almira, which had capsized a week earlier in the Atlantic Ocean. =California, 1847–1850= Recommissioned on 9 February 1847, Southampton sailed south on 22 February, rounded Cape Horn, and proceeded up the Pacific coast of the Americas to the California coast. For the next two years, she supplied the ships which protected the newly won territory of the United States on the west coast. She returned to New York on 2 September 1850 and was decommissioned on the 15th. =Pacific Squadron, 1851–1852= Recommissioned on the last day of 1850, Southampton departed New York on 2 February 1851 for another tour of duty with the Pacific Squadron, and returned to New York on 5 August 1852. She was decommissioned five days later to be fitted out for duty in the Far East. =Japan, 1852–1855= The ship was recommissioned on 4 November 1852 and assigned to the East India Squadron and she sailed on 8 December for the Pacific. The following September, she joined Commodore Matthew C. Perry's squadron and was part of his expedition to Japan, entering Edo Bay during his second visit to Japan on 13 February 1854.

The series was modeled after the 1962-1964 TV show Stump The Stars, which itself is a successor of the long-running Pantomime Quiz of the 1950s.TV Guide Guide to TV (2006) Much like the earlier versions, the show consisted of two teams of four celebrities attempting to act out comedic phrases, each within 75 seconds instead of two minutes like in prior versions. The team who guessed all their phrases in the least amount of time won $500 for their favorite charity. The series was produced by Fein-Schwartz Productions, in association with Columbia Pictures Television. Music was provided by Score Productions, and would be recycled for other game shows: a re-arranged version of a commercial cue later became the theme to Mindreaders hosted by Dick Martin of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In fame which in turn was also the theme for the unsold 1980's pilot called Puzzlers hosted by future Wheel of Fortune star Pat Sajak, while a re-arranged version of the main theme with a faster tempo was used during the pricing game Switcheroo on the Tom Kennedy version of The Price Is Right which in turn it was also the theme of the unsold game show pilot called Babble also hosted by Tom Kennedy in 1984. AMC version The second (and most recent) version aired five episodes from June 20 to 24, 2005 on the AMC television network in America.Sponsorship announcement for Celebrity Charades from thefutoncritic.com The show stemmed from a private series of parties hosted by actor Chad Lowe and his wife, actress Hilary Swank. =Gameplay= On the show, celebrity teams of five were sent into two separate rooms. In each round of play, a set of five movie titles to be guessed are predetermined by the producers. One person from each team is given the first title; then each must run to a section of the house where his/her teammates are waiting, then pantomime the title. The team member who guesses correctly subsequently runs to the central location where someone is waiting with the second answer to be guessed. This goes on for five answers. When all answers are guessed, the team must come up with the common theme that chains the answers together. The first team to do so wins the round.AMC Celebrity Charades webpage including link to Chad Lowe explaining the rules of the game. There is no prize awarded to the winner. Instead, all participants agreed to donate their appearance fee to a charity of their choice. Episode status The first three episodes (all with the same celebrities) were aired by GSN in the fall of 1997, after which the show was pulled off the schedule for unknown reasons, although a random episode from later in the show's run was aired as a GSN Game of the Week in 1999.

The highway runs from Point Lookout in St. Mary's County north to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland, Prince George's County. MD 5 begins as two-lane undivided Point Lookout Road which runs from Point Lookout, St. Mary's County, to an intersection with MD 235 in the northern part of the county. Point Lookout Road passes through rural areas as well as the county seat of Leonardtown. After the MD 235 intersection, the route becomes four-lane divided Three Notch Road and continues into Charles County, where it becomes Leonardtown Road. Here, the route bypasses Hughesville and continues north toward the Waldorf area, which it bypasses to the east on Mattawoman Beantown Road. The route merges onto U.S. Route 301 (US 301, Crain Highway) and enters Prince George's County, splitting from US 301 at an interchange in Brandywine. From here, MD 5 continues north on Branch Avenue, running through suburban areas, before becoming a freeway as it passes Andrews Air Force Base and interchanges with Interstate 95 (I-95)/I-495 (Capital Beltway). Past the Capital Beltway, the route runs through suburban areas of Hillcrest Heights and Suitland before reaching the D.C. border, where Branch Avenue SE continues, crossing Pennsylvania Avenue SE and eventually terminating at Randle Circle. MD 5 was designated in 1927 to run from Point Lookout to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland. The route was realigned to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. line in 1939, while MD 637 was designated along the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border. Between 1939 and 1949, the route continued into Washington, D.C. as District of Columbia Route 5 (DC 5), which followed Naylor Road SE, Good Hope Road SE, 11th Street SE, and DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue) to US 1 and US 240 near the White House. MD 5 was realigned to head to the Washington, D.C. border along Branch Avenue in 1950. During the course of the 1950s and 1960s, most of MD 5 between the MD 235 intersection and the Washington, D.C. border was widened into a divided highway. In 1993, the route bypassed Leonardtown; the original alignment was designated MD 5 Business (MD 5 Bus.) before it was decommissioned in 2012. In 1997, MD 5 was realigned to bypass Waldorf to the east along what had been designated as MD 205 in 1989. The former alignment through Waldorf followed what is now MD 5 Bus. and US 301. In Prince George's County, multiple interchanges were built along MD 5 between MD 223 and the Capital Beltway in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, a four-lane, divided bypass of Hughesville was completed, alleviating the traffic bottleneck within that town at the intersection of MD 231. The former alignment through Hughesville became MD 5 Bus. The portion of MD 5 between US 301 and the Capital Beltway is slated to be upgraded to a full freeway, with an interchange at MD 373 (Accokeek Road)/Brandywine Road completed and the remainder of the freeway upgrade still in the planning stages.

MD 5 follows Mattawoman Beantown Road, a four-lane divided highway that bypasses the center of Waldorf to the east. The route intersects Poplar Hill Road, which leads to the house of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd. Mattawoman Beantown Road carries MD 5 north through farm fields before heading into woodland, passing west of a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses. It continues into suburban residential areas of Waldorf, passing by the entrance to the Pinefield neighborhood, which used to be intertwined with several Nike Missile installations. The route crosses over CSX's Popes Creek Subdivision before coming to an intersection with US 301 (Crain Highway). This intersection has no direct access from northbound MD 5 to southbound US 301, with access provided by Mattawoman Road. Here, MD 5 forms a concurrency with US 301 and continues north as a six-lane divided highway. =Prince George's County= The Crain Highway crosses the Mattawoman Creek into Prince George's County, where it heads north through wooded areas with some businesses along the road. US 301 splits from MD 5 at an interchange near Brandywine with MD 5 continuing to the north on four-lane divided Branch Avenue.

History MD 5 northbound along the Hughesville Bypass In 1911, the road between Leonardtown and Mechanicsville and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border was completed as a state highway while the sections between south of Beantown and the border between Charles and Prince George's counties and between TB and Camp Springs were under contract. At this time, the road between Point Lookout and Leonardtown, Mechanicsville and Beantown, and the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB were proposed as state highways. By 1915, the entire length of the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border was completed. This state highway was paved to the northwest of Leonardtown, between north of Morganza and Hughesville, between the Charles-Prince George's county border and north of TB, and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border while the remainder was an unpaved state road. MD 5 was designated in 1927 to the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border, passing through Leonardtown, Hughesville, and Waldorf. MD 5 ran concurrent with MD 3 (now US 301) between Waldorf and TB. In 1928, the route was paved between north of TB and Camp Springs. By 1933, MD 5 was paved between northwest of Leonardtown and north of Morganza and along the MD 3 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border. Also, the route was extended south along an unpaved road into Point Lookout State Park. In 1939, MD 5 was rerouted to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. border while the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border was designated as MD 637. DC 5 continued into Washington, D.C. along Naylor Road SE, Good Hope Road SE, and 11th Street SE to DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue SE). By this time, the section of route between Hughesville and Waldorf was paved while the section between Point Lookout and Leonardtown was a bituminous road. By 1946, MD 5 was paved between Great Mills and Leonardtown. Also, DC 5 was extended to follow DC 4 along Pennsylvania Avenue to US 1 and US 240 at the east side of the White House. In 1949, the DC 5 designation was decommissioned. In 1950, MD 5 was rerouted to follow Branch Avenue to the Washington, D.C. border, replacing MD 637; MD 637 was designated onto Naylor Road between MD 5 and the Washington, D.C. border by 1966. In addition, the route was widened into a divided highway along the US 301 concurrency between the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB and along Branch Avenue between south of the Henson Creek and the Washington, D.C. border. MD 5 was upgraded from a bituminous to a paved road between St. Mary's City and Great Mills in 1953. The same year, the portion of route along the US 301 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border was widened into a divided highway. MD 5 was relocated to a new alignment to the east between TB and north of Camp Springs in 1956, with a northward extension of MD 381 designated onto the former alignment. This section of MD 381, called Brandywine Road and Old Branch Avenue, was transferred to county maintenance in 1965. In 1959, MD 5 was paved between south of St. Inigoes and St. Mary's City. A year later, the remainder of the route south to Point Lookout was paved. In 1962, MD 5 was widened into a divided highway between south of Newmarket and the St. Mary's-Charles county border and between MD 223 in Clinton and Camp Springs. An interchange was built at the northern terminus of the US 301 concurrency in 1963. The route was upgraded to a divided highway in the Beantown area in 1964. In 1965, MD 5 was improved to a divided highway between MD 235 and south of Newmarket. The divided highway was extended south from Beantown to the MD 488 intersection in 1966. In 1967, the route was widened into a divided highway between the St. Mary's-Charles county border and MD 488 with the exception of the portion through Hughesville. MD 5 was upgraded to a divided highway between US 301 and MD 223 in 1969. An interchange was constructed at MD 414 in 1970. MD 5 was routed to bypass Leonardtown by 1993, with the former route becoming MD 5 Bus. During the 1990s and early 2000s, multiple interchanges were constructed along MD 5 in Prince George's County. In 1992, an interchange was built at MD 223. The interchange with MD 337 was built in 1996. In 1999, an interchange was constructed at Coventry Way. In 2001, an interchange was constructed with Manchester Drive and Linda Lane in Camp Springs. What is now MD 5 between Leonardtown Road and Poplar Hill Road was constructed as a gravel road by 1927. This road was designated part of MD 233. In 1956, MD 382 was extended west into Charles County along part of what had been MD 233 to MD 5 at Beantown. MD 382 was removed from Charles County in 1989. That same year, MD 205 was assigned to the westernmost portion of Poplar Hill Road in Beantown and north along two- lane Mattawoman-Beantown Road to US 301 and MD 5 at Mattawoman. The route was expanded to a four-lane divided highway and was taken over as MD 5's bypass of Waldorf in 1997. The portion of MD 5 from what had been MD 205's southern terminus west to US 301 became MD 5 Bus. In February 2007, a $56 million limited-access bypass around Hughesville was completed, redirecting MD 5 to the east of the community. The bypass was built due to the heavy amount of congestion at the old intersection of MD 5 and MD 231 in Hughesville's central business district. Groundbreaking for construction of the bypass took place on November 5, 2004, with $10 million in federal funds given to the project. The old portion of MD 5 that went through Hughesville received the official MD 625 designation in 2006, even though it is signed as MD 5 Bus. The bypass was formally opened on August 8, 2007. There are plans to improve MD 5 in Prince George's County due to traffic congestion along the route. An interchange was built with MD 373 and Brandywine Road in Brandywine that also widened the route to six lanes in the vicinity of the interchange. Construction of Phase 1, which widened MD 5 to 6 lanes in the vicinity of the interchange, began in November 2009 and was completed in August 2011. Phase 2, which will build the interchange itself, went through the design phase, with construction beginning in 2016 and be completed in 2020. On February 4, 2019, the intersection with MD 5 and Brandywine Road was replaced with a bridge over MD 5 at the new interchange. In addition, the route is planned to be upgraded to a full freeway between US 301 and the Capital Beltway, with new interchanges at Burch Hill Road/Earnshaw Drive and Surratts Road. This project is currently in the planning stages with many alternatives including upgrading only portions to freeway, adding reversible lanes or high-occupancy vehicle lanes, and various interchange designs.

A 7cm long scratch-built model of 1/700 scale Japanese gunboat Fushimi (1939), built out of paper and copper wire. A scratch-built 1:87 scale model of an old Vespa garage in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong 1950s, mainly built out of Foamcore and plastic card. A scratch-built 1:150 model of Hong Kong's 'Tong Lau' tenement building. Scratch building is easiest if original plans of the subject exist; however, many models have been built from photographs by measuring a known object in the photograph and extrapolating the rest of the dimensions. The necessary parts are then fashioned out of a suitable material, such as wood, plastic, plaster, clay, metal, polymer clay, or even paper, and then assembled. Some purists consider a model not to be truly scratchbuilt unless all of the parts were made from raw materials. However most modellers would consider a model including commercial detail parts as scratchbuilt. Scratchbuilding a new body onto an altered ready-to-run chassis is also acceptable. Motives The reasons hobbyists scratchbuild may vary. Often a desired model is unavailable in kit form in the desired scale, or entirely non-existent. Sometimes the hobbyist may be dissatisfied with the accuracy or detail of kits that are available. Other times a hobbyist will opt to scratchbuild simply for the challenge. Less frequently a hobbyist will scratchbuild out of economy, as often the raw materials cost less than a packaged commercial kit. Techniques Most hobbyists develop their skills by building kits, then progress to kitbashing, where various kits are combined to create a unique model before attempting to scratchbuild. Sometimes scratchbuilders utilize discarded parts of other models or toys, with or without modification, either in order to speed up the building process or to allow the process to continue in spite of certain parts being difficult to make. Some companies sell parts that are of little use to anyone but scratchbuilders. Building stock Building stock, in whichever material, can be plain sheets, strips, bars, tubes, rods, or even structural shapes such as L or T girders. Stock can also be embossed or textured to replicate a certain prototype material (such as plastic sheet embossed with grooves to mimic a scale brick wall). For example, to scratch-build a small board fence, the modeler could use plastic rod stock to form the vertical posts, then use plastic bar stock to form horizontal rails affixed to the posts, lay plastic strip stock vertically on the horizontal rails (perhaps 'distressed' with a wire brush to mimic wood grain, or by using thin strips of actual wood), trimming the top and bottoms of the strips to be even, adding details like nail holes (using a small pin), and then finishing and weathering (making a model look like it has been used via dust, dirt, stains, and wear). Method There are as many ways of scratch-building models as there are modelers, but generally the modeler obtains plans of a prototype, or designs his own, transfers these plans to paper or other material as patterns (much easier since the arrival of household computer printers and copiers), and uses these patterns to cut, trim and affix the stock together to form the model. Finishing work (such as sanding and polishing, painting, weathering, distressing by forming dents and rust, dust, etc.) is done to complete the model and (hopefully) bring it to a lifelike state.

Known as the athletic world's \\"Boy Wonder\\", he competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London and the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. He was born in Toronto, Ontario. In 1908, at just 19 years of age, Tait won his first round heat of the 1500 metres with a time of 4:12.2. Despite the relatively slow time (other heat winners ran as fast as 4:03.4), Tait won by nearly fifty yards. His time in the final was much quicker, at 4:06.8, and he finished in fourth place. Tait also competed in the 1908 marathon and the 5 miles, failing to finish in either event. In 1912, facing speculative news from doctors that his heart had become enlarged from eight grueling years of training and competition, Tait finished fourth in his heat of the 1500 metres, failing to qualify for the final. He also competed in the marathon, again failing to finish. Outside of the Olympics, Tait was one of the most versatile middle and long distance runners in the world, and one of the great milers of his era. In November 1907, he finished just 10 yards behind close friend and sometimes-rival Tom Longboat in the gruelling 15-mile Montreal Marathon road race, with both runners being watched in the streets by a crowd of 200,000. Tait and Longboat duelled and had the time of their young lives three times, in 1907-1908, over the famed 2.5 and 5-mile West End YMCA courses up-and-down the Dovercourt Road—with Tait beating Longboat over 5 miles in July 1907 as a 6-year old Lester Pearson watched in awe from the crowd at the finish line. Tait ran 4:05 for 1,500 metres at the 1908 Olympic Trials in Rosedale Stadium, Toronto, a Canadian record that stood until 1933. He also won a gold medal in the mile at the Festival of the Empire Sports, the first British Empire Games ever held, in London, 1911. Most importantly for him, Canada's team won the championship at Crystal Palace over Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. He was awarded both of his pure gold medals by King George V (the 'stutterer's' father). Upon returning to Toronto, his friends and teammates looked on in front of a crowd of 20,000 people outside Old City Hall, as Jack Tait sheepishly accepted a new Grandfather Clock from the mayor for his win in the mile. That evening, he received his second great reception in two years inside the Great Hall of the vaunted West End YMCA. Tait also set world indoor records for 880 yards (1:54) in 1909, 1,000 yards (2:14) and 1.5 miles (6:52) in 1910, and established Canadian records at 3 and 5 miles . He remained a devoted amateur and worked throughout his athletic career, running for the West End YMCA of Toronto from 1902 to 1914. Overseeing his career during the \\"Y\\" days was YMCA elder and his older brother Will Tait, a coach on the 1908 Canadian Olympic Team and later manager of the Edmonton Gradettes women's basketball team from 1924 to 1936 (which served as the junior/feeder team to the world-famous Edmonton Grads). Jack Tait was also a founding member of the Balmy Beach Harriers Club in 1905, where he and other members of the West End Y and Canadian Olympic teams would set-up residence - starting in the Y's 'Marathon House' on the shores of Lake Ontario - and a full training camp all summer, near the bottom of Silver Birch Ave. and the boardwalk, in Toronto'd east-end Beach neighborhood. \\"Smiling Jack\\" was well-known among fellow athletes and fans throughout North America for his raw speed and talent, public sense of fair play, and for his legendary humour. After he ran his 'slowish', tactical 4:47 to win that Festival of the Empire mile championship, Tait confessed to a group of English reporters: \\"I'm telling you, boys, if I'd run a mile like that in my own country I'd be shot. They actually accused me of using my brains out there today. Can you imagine?\\" Funny indeed, as between 1909 and 1913 he ran the mile on four separate occasions in 4:22, almost fifty years before the 4-minute barrier was finally broken. Tait counted among his close friends and teammates the likes of Mr. Longboat, Alfred Shrubb and Bobby Kerr, journalists Doug Laurie and Lou Marsh, and the great American middle distance stars Abel Kiviat, George Bonhag and Mel Shepherd. Kiviat remained the world's oldest living Olympic medalist through the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Astonishingly, after more than 60 years passed since they last saw each other, Kiviat paid tribute to his great friendship and rivalry with Tait—citing the support and encouragement he received as a naive 17 year-old from the \\"older runner with the big heart\\"—during a televised interview with Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. All Carson asked Kiviat was: \\"Of all those great athletes you were around, like Jim Thorpe, who do you remember most?\\" After 1911 Tait also found fame as a sports reporter and columnist for the Mail and Empire, Toronto Telegram, Toronto Daily World and the Toronto Sunday World, co-founding the famous \\"Yap Yaps Corner\\" (a popular celebrity sports and humour column) with Mr. Laurie. From 1915-18 he served double-duty in The Great War as an artillery gunner in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and as a war correspondent for the Telegram. In 1910, Tait ran a series of famous indoor \\"match\\" races against George Bonhag, the undefeated world's \\"indoor king\\" and multiple Olympic medalist. With North American telegraph services and newspapers hanging off every race, Tait defeated the American in 2 of 4 races held in New York City at Madison Square Garden, and in Buffalo, NY. In one of his victories, Tait beat Bonhag in the Garden one night after the two were hilariously forced to share the same bed for-rest in the afternoon, due to overcrowding in the New York Athletic Club. That evening in front of a crowd of 9,000 they both ducked under the existing world indoor record for 1.5 miles, with Tait ahead by 25 yards. He was later celebrated as a conquering hero in the Great Hall of the West End YMCA, at Queen St. and Dovercourt Road -- 'The house that Jack Built', as they called the 'West End Y' from 1904 to 1911, until the famed facility moved to Dovercourt and College St. Jack Tait actually lived on Dovercourt Road in Toronto's west end during his athletic career, where from 1903-1907 his neighbors were the Rev. Edwin Pearson family. Almost fifty years later, in 1952, one of Mr. Pearson's sons, Lester Bowles Pearson—Prime Minister of Canada from 1963-1968—finally let it slip in great detail—in his first-ever interview about growing up in Toronto—that Jack Tait was his first and most profound boyhood hero. Pearson and Tait then began a memorable, hilarious correspondence by mail, telephone and telegram until 1969. From 1926 - 1971, Jack Tait and family lived at 207 Wineva Ave. in the heart of Toronto's famed Beach neighborhood. Tait is also the grandfather of Paul Williams, former Canadian record holder for 3,000, 5,000 and 10,000 metres between 1979 and 1994. Williams was a three-time Olympian in 1984, 1988 and 1992, a Commonwealth Games bronze medalist (10,000 m) in 1990, Goodwill Games gold medalist over 5,000 metres (1990), and the first Canadian ever to run under 28 minutes for 10,000 metres.

While posted to Ireland, he ran with Clonliffe Harriers and won the Irish 1 mile and 4 mile titles in 1901. Returning to England, he joined Herne Hill Harriers in 1903 and soon established a reputation as one of the country's finest cross-country runners, winning an individual bronze (1905) and team gold medals (1905, 1906 and 1908) at the International Cross Country Championships. He finished second in the English national cross-country championships in 1907 and showed sufficient form in track races during the early part of the 1908 season to be selected to race in three events at the Olympic Games. Deakin won his first round heat of the 1500 metres event with a time of 4:13.6. Despite being one of the slowest first round winners, Deakin won by seventy-five yards.

He was primarily responsible for the design of the so-called German hammer action. Pianos with this hammer action, or its more developed form known as the Viennese action, may be said to be appropriate for the performance of the piano music of Haydn, Mozart, and the early Beethoven.Grove, \\"Stein\\" Life Stein was born in 1728 in Heidelsheim in the Upper Palatinate.For more on Stein and more bibliographical references to him, see: Michael Latcham, Pianos for Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven: change and contrast, Munich & Salzburg 2016, chs. 4, 5, 6, 9 & 12, and Michael Latcham, Three essays on keyboard instruments, Munich & Salzburg 2020, ch. 2. He died in Augsburg in 1792 in Augsburg. He learned his trade as an organ builder from his father in Heidelsheim and from August 1748 to January 1749 as a journeyman at two workshops, those of Johann Andreas Silbermann in Strasbourg and of Frantz Jacob Spath in Regensburg. Johann Andreas Silbermann was the eldest of the four sons of Andreas Silbermann, the elder brother of Gottfried Silbermann. Stein settled in Augsburg, probably in 1750 and became a citizen in 1756 or 1757, the latter the year in which he completed his magnificent organ for the so-called Barfüßerkirche in Augsburg. In the same year he became organist at the church. According to a letter he wrote, he gave up organ building in the 1760s in order to devote himself to stringed keyboard instruments. His first contact with piano making may have occurred in the Spath workshop, not in the Silbermann workshop. As a stringed keyboard instrument maker Stein built clavichords, harpsichords and pianos. He also built some more extraordinary keyboard instruments including the \\"Poli- Toni-Clavichordium\\" (described in the Augsburg Intelligenzblatt in 1769) that combined a large harpsichord having four choirs of strings (registration 8', 8', 8', 16') with a piano. He also built (1772) the \\"Melodica,\\" a small organ in which the player's touch could alter volume; this melody instrument could be used with a harpsichord or a piano or on a separate manual of an organ or simply as a solo instrument. The importance of the Melodica, of which Stein may only have made a few prototypes, lies in Stein's own 1772 description. In that published description he expressed his dissatisfaction with keyboard instruments in general because they did not allow of expressivity in the manner of the human voice, the violin and the trombone. The 1769 description of the expressive possibilities of the Poli-Tono-Clavichordium nonetheless shows Stein's confidence in stringed keyboard instruments that in the end led him to the invention of his so-called German hammer action shortly before 1780. He also built \\"vis-à-vis\\" instruments with a piano and a harpsichord facing one another in a single case. In both the surviving examples (Verona 1777, Naples 1783), the player of the harpsichord (8', 8', 8', 16' in Verona, 8' quill, 8' leather, 4' quill in Naples) can also couple the piano action at the other end on one of the harpsichord keyboards. The Verona instrument has hand stops for engaging and disengaging the stops, in the manner of an organ or a German harpsichord, whereas the Naples instrument has knee levers in the manner of French harpsichords. Stein travelled twice to Paris and once to Vienna. He also made trips to other cities in Germany and Switzerland to deliver instruments as evidenced in his notebook.See: The notebook of Johann Andreas Stein: facsimile – transcription – translation, edited and annotated with an introduction by Michael Latcham, Wilhelmshaven 2014 The hammer action in the 1777 Vis-à-vis is unique in Stein's oeuvre, that in the 1783 Vis-à-vis is Stein's so-called German action. Two clavichords by Stein survive, one of them, now in the Budapest National Museum, was bought by Leopold Mozart for practising while travelling. One instrument combining a piano and a single rank of organ pipes survives in Gothenberg's Historical Museum. About fifteen Hammerflügel (wing-shaped pianos) bearing Stein's label survive, ranging in date from 1780 to 1794 (sic). The making of those of after about 1790 would have been supervised by Nannette, Stein's daughter. Of the fifteen, two are privately owned (1782 and 1783). The instrument shown above is not by Stein but probably by Louis Dulcken. Apart from the music desk, typical of Dulcken's work, the instrument has the appearance of a piano by Stein. Many such instruments built after Stein, some with fake labels, exist. His contributions to the piano =The Prellmechanik action= Stein's most important innovation, his piano action, was perfected around 1780.See: Michael Latcham, Essays towards a new history of the early piano. A context for the work of Johann Andreas Stein as a piano maker. Munich & Salzburg 2019 This is the so-called Prellzungenmechanik or German action with an escapement mechanism. In this arrangement, each hammer was mounted on top of the key, with the head on the end closer to the player, a traditional arrangement in German pianos of Stein's day. The hammers were like small, asymmetrical levers, with the hammer head far from the fulcrum, and a small upward-facing hook (\\"beak\\") on the other side of the lever, much closer to the fulcrum. When the player depressed the key, the whole hammer assembly would rise. The beak would engage an escapement hopper attached to the keyframe. The escapement hopper pulled down on the beak as it rose, in turn causing the hammer (the other end of the lever) to fly upward and strike the string. The escapement hopper was hinged and sprung; this permitted the beak to push past it as the key sank back to rest position.Grove, \\"Pianoforte\\" Diagram of the Stein action Latcham (see Grove reference below) calls this invention \\"a breakthrough in the piano's history;\\" it \\"offer[ed] the player a remarkable control of the hammers, especially when playing softly, and [wa]s astonishingly responsive to the player’s touch.\\" =Damper control= Stein may have been the first to produce a knee lever for the dampers, the forerunner of the damper pedal using which the player can disengage all the dampers from the strings. Such a device had been devised by Gottfried Silbermann in the 1740s for his wing-shaped pianos but it was operated by two hand levers and required the use of the player's hands to work them, and thus could only be deployed during pauses in the music. Stein's device was controlled by a knee lever. Stein's device is mentioned in the 1769 description of his Poly-Toni-Clavichordium. It is clear from the description however that Stein's 1769 knee lever, when pressed in, engaged the dampers; it did not disengage them. Playing pianos without the dampers, using a knee lever to engage the dampers when required was not unusual at the time. Stein's later pianos, starting with the one described by Mozart in 1777, had a knee lever for disengaging all the dampers at once, permitting the equivalent of modern piano pedaling =Stein's acquaintance with Mozart= Mozart visited and befriended Stein in Augsburg in 1777, during the (unsuccessful) job-hunting tour that took him also to Mannheim and Paris. The enthusiastic letter that Mozart wrote to his father Leopold is informative concerning Stein and Mozart's own preferences in pianos. The letter is very widely quoted. The following translation, by Emily Anderson, is taken from Broder 1941: > This time I shall begin at once with Stein's pianofortes. Before I had seen > any of his make, Späth'sMozart refers to Frantz Jacob Spath (1714-1786), who > worked in Regensburg. . claviers\\"Clavier\\" was a general term in German for a > keyboard instrument but sometimes meant only the clavichord.

This letter dates from before the oldest-known piano (1780) by Stein with his German action. The only piano by Stein of before 1780 is the piano in the 1777 Vis-à-vis in Verona. That piano has a different type of hammer action, but also one with an escapement mechanism for the hammers. It may have been this earlier action that impressed Mozart.See: Michael Latcham, ‘Mozart and the pianos of Johann Andreas Stein’, The Galpin Society Journal LI, 1998, 114–53 During the years following his move to Vienna (1781), Mozart bought a piano, not from Stein, but from Anton Walter, a Viennese builder who followed Stein's design principles but may be said to have improved them. It is not known whether Mozart actually preferred Walter's pianos to Stein's. Mozart probably bought his piano by Walter in 1782. The instrument still exists but with a hammer action that has almost certainly been changed by Walter after Mozart's death, perhaps in about 1805. The type of hammer action the Mozart piano had when Mozart owned it is not known. Walter probably first made his developed form of Stein's hammer action in about 1789.See: Michael Latcham,‘Zur Frage der Authentizität und Datierung der Klaviere von Anton Walter zwischen 1780 und 1800’, in: Rudolph Angermüller and Alfons Huber (eds.), Der Hammerflügel von Anton Walter aus dem Besitz von Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Salzburg 2000, 114–45 The Stein piano dynasty Stein was the founder of an important piano-making dynasty. His daughter Nannette (Augsburg, 1769 - Vienna 1833) appears to have taken on the leadership of her father's firm in about 1790 when her father had become too ill to continue. In 1794, Nannette, together with her husband Andreas Streicher (1761–1833), who she married in the same year, and her brother Matthäus Stein (1776–1842), moved her family’s piano- making firm from Augsburg, where it was founded by her father, to Vienna, and continued the family business under her husband's name, Streicher. In the Autumn of 1802 the siblings, who inscribed their instruments with the name Frère et Sœur Stein in Wien, separated; Nannette then inscribed her instruments Nannette Streicher née Stein in Wien. Some innovations were made in about 1805 but by 1807 she had developed her father’s small five-octave piano, shaped like a harpsichord, into an impressive grand piano of six-and-a- half octaves. Some more improvements were made by 1811, but after that date her design was maintained largely unchanged until Johann Baptist Streicher (1796–1871), her son, became joint owner of the firm with his mother in 1823. The firm continued after Nannette’s death under her son and after his death in 1871, under his son Emil. Emil’s son, the composer Theodor Streicher, owned the Hammerflügel of 1808 by Nannette Streicher in the collection of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (inv. no. MIR 1117). In 1896 the firm ceased production, just over one hundred years after the move to Vienna. Meanwhile, after the separation of the siblings, Nannette's brother, known as André Stein, also continued to build pianos. In 1796 André married Maria Theresia Dischler (1769–1855), an event marked by a letter from Beethoven including his congratulations. The letter mentions a piano by Nannette Streicher that he had on loan for an Accademie. The letter suggests that the sound of the instrument was too weak for Beethoven's needs. André Stein obtained his citizenship of Vienna and became a master piano maker there in 1803. Despite Andreas Streicher’s adverse comments (mostly of a personal nature to do with André Stein’s reputedly difficult character), André Stein made fine instruments and developed an individual style thought by some to exceed that of his sister Nannette; he flourished in the 1820s. In 1828 Friedrich Wieck (1785–1873) acquired a Hammerflügel by André Stein for his daughter Clara (1819–1896); she later married Robert Schumann; her instrument by Stein is preserved today in the Robert Schumann House in Zwickau. From Beethoven’s conversation books it is clear that André Stein was well known to Beethoven and helped him not only by tuning and maintaining instruments but also by making a large horn to amplify the sound of the piano. Matthäus Andreas died in May 1842 in the Mondscheinhaus, the building bought by his only son Carl Andreas Stein (1797–1863) from the renowned piano maker Conrad Graf (1782–1851) in 1841. Carl Andreas continued in his father’s footsteps as a piano maker but also made a name as a composer and as a pianist. Numerous instruments by André Stein survive; these include more than twenty Hammerflügel dating from about 1803 to at least 1838, eleven square pianos, probably all after 1815, and two upright Hammerflügel. Most of these pianos are in public collections.See: Michael Latcham, Verzeichnis der Europäischen Musikinstrumente im Germanischen Nationalmuseum Nürnberg; volume 7; the pianos of Johann Andreas Stein and his descendants and the pianos of the firm of Anton Walter, Wilhelmshaven 2016 As model for modern instruments The Stein pianos remain prestigious today and have served as models for contemporary builders (such Philip Belt and Paul McNulty) of historically-styled instruments.

It saw action throughout the war. It was used as the floating prison for the conspirators in the Abraham Lincoln assassination and was the site of the autopsy and identification of assassin John Wilkes Booth. Construction Montauk was built by John Ericsson at Continental Iron Works, Greenpoint, Brooklyn; launched on October 9, 1862; and commissioned at New York on December 14, 1862, Commander John L. Worden in command.

Interior of the Turret A principal ironclad in the naval attack on Charleston, South Carolina, Montauk departed New York on December 24, 1862, arriving Port Royal, South Carolina on January 19, 1863, to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Taking advantage of the opportunity to test the XV-inch Dahlgren gun and armor of the Passaic-class ironclad for the first time, on January 27, Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont sent Montauk, with the gunboats , , and mortar schooner to bombard Fort McAllister, Georgia. Although hit 13 times, Montauk was undamaged. The ironclad made a second attack on February 1, badly battering the fort; but Montauk was hit 48 times. She destroyed the blockade runner Rattlesnake on February 28 in Ogeechee River but while descending the river was herself damaged by a torpedo (mine) which exploded under her. Montauk steamed into the North Fork of the Edisto River on April 1 in preparation for the attack on Charleston. At midafternoon on April 7, Admiral Du Pont's ironclads attacked Fort Sumter. The Union ships braved intense fire from Confederates coastal artillery, and kept their own guns operating effectively until withdrawing toward evening. Damage to the monitors prevented Du Pont from resuming the attack the next day with Montauk taking 20 hits. The ironclads launched an attack on Fort Wagner, Morris Island on July 10. Capturing this island was important as it would permit access to the interior defenses of Charleston Harbor. Assuming command of the naval forces, John Dahlgren boarded Montauk on July 16 and after consultation with the captains, renewed the attack on Fort Wagner and bombarded it daily until it was evacuated by the Confederates on September 6. The ships then turned their attention to Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie operating for the rest of the year against these fortifications which guarded the Cradle of the Rebellion. However, the Confederate works would never be taken by sea. Montauk remained off Charleston until July 1864, when she shifted operations to the Stono River. In February 1865, she transferred to the Cape Fear River. Proceeding to the Washington Navy Yard after the end of the conflict, she served as a floating bier for assassin John Wilkes Booth on April 27 and a floating prison for six accomplices.

The Workstation software consists of a virtual machine suite for Intel x86-compatible computers (running Microsoft Windows or Linux) (for Mac version, see Parallels Desktop for Mac) which allows the simultaneous creation and execution of multiple x86 virtual computers. The product is distributed as a download package. Parallels Workstation has been discontinued for Windows and Linux as of 2013.  Implementation  Like other virtualization software, Parallels Workstation uses hypervisor technology, which is a thin software layer between Primary OS and host computer. The hypervisor directly controls some of the host machine's hardware resources and provides an interface to it for both virtual machine monitors and primary OS. This allows virtualization software to reduce overhead. Parallels Workstation's hypervisor also supports hardware virtualization technologies like Intel VT-x and AMD-V.  Features  Parallels Workstation is a hardware emulation virtualization software, in which a virtual machine engine enables each virtual machine to work with its own processor, RAM, floppy drive, CD drive, I/O devices, and hard disk – everything a physical computer contains. Parallels Workstation virtualizes all devices within the virtual environment, including the video adapter, network adapter, and hard disk adapters. It also provides pass-through drivers for parallel port and USB devices. Because all guest virtual machines use the same hardware drivers irrespective of the actual hardware on the host computer, virtual machine instances are highly portable between computers.

In 1942, the Coleman National Fish Hatchery (Coleman NFH) was established under an act of the U.S. Congress to mitigate the loss of historic spawning habitat caused by the construction of dams. The fish hatchery is located in Shasta County, California near the town of Anderson on the north bank of Battle Creek approximately east of the Sacramento River. Coleman NFH covers approximately of land owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), with an additional of land in perpetual easements for pipelines and access. It is the largest salmon hatchery in the continental United States. Before the construction of the Shasta and Keswick Dams, Chinook Salmon and steelhead were free to migrate to the upper reaches of the Sacramento, Pit and McCloud Rivers to spawn. Chinook salmon and steelhead returning from the ocean, travel up the Sacramento River and Battle Creek where they are enticed by water flow into the hatchery. Eggs are collected, fertilized and incubated artificially until they hatch. The young fish are then raised in ponds at the hatchery until they are sufficient size to be released and return to the ocean. Long term production goals for Coleman NFH Complex are as follows: 12,000,000 fall Chinook salmon, 1,200,000 late-fall Chinook salmon, 250,000 winter Chinook salmon, and 600,000 steelhead annually. Winter Chinook salmon are reared at the Livingston Stone National Fish Hatchery, a sub-station of Coleman NFH, located at the base of Shasta Dam. Coleman NFH was constructed in 1942 as a mitigation measure to preserve Chinook salmon populations following construction of Shasta Dam. Shasta Dam permanently blocked approximately 50% of key spawning and rearing habitat(s) for Chinook salmon and steelhead (Skinner 1958). The Shasta Salvage Plan authorized the construction and operation of a fish hatchery (Moffett 1949; Black 1999) to offset natural production losses. Fish production began at Coleman NFH in 1943. Production objectives for Coleman NFH include two runs of salmon and steelhead. The facility goal(s) are to ensure contribution from upper Sacramento River salmonid populations to commercial (ocean) and sport fisheries (ocean and river). Coleman NFH contributes substantially to the multimillion-dollar commercial and recreational fishing industry in California. Three intake structures and associated conveyance facilities are used to divert and convey water directly from Battle Creek and the Coleman Powerhouse tailrace (Figure 1). The primary intake (1) is located within the tailrace of Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E;) Coleman Powerhouse, on the north bank (Figure 2). Intake water is transferred through a conveyance pipe and diverted into Coleman Canal. The secondary intake (2) is located on the south bank of Battle Creek (across from intake 1). Intake 2 shares the conveyance pipe with intake 1 and diverts water to Coleman Canal. Intake 2 serves as an emergency back-up water diversion structure for intake 1, supplying water to Coleman Canal 17 days annually (10-year average 1990-2000). Intake 1 and 2 are approximately upstream of Coleman NFH. Intake 3 is upstream from Coleman NFH and acts as the tertiary diversion for the hatchery. Water is diverted from Intake 3 to the hatchery through pipe. Water from all intakes may be diverted to the ozone facility or sent directly to hatchery rearing units at Coleman NFH References =Footnotes= =Sources= * Black, M. 1999.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use \\"Celtic\\" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \\"Celtic art\\" only from the La Tène period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards.Megaws, for example; see their introductory section, where they explain the situation & that their article will only cover the La Tène period. Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD. It is also used by Jacobsthal; however the equivalent \\"Late Celtic art\\" for Early Medieval work is much rarer, and \\"Late Celtic art\\" can also mean the later part of the prehistoric period. The Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the Book of Kells and other masterpieces, and is what \\"Celtic art\\" evokes for much of the general public in the English- speaking world, is called Insular art in art history. This is the best-known part, but not the whole of, the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages, which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland.Laings, 6-12 Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence.Megaws Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare. Possibly the few standing male figures found, like the Warrior of Hirschlanden and the so-called \\"Lord of Glauberg\\", were originally common in wood. Also covered by the term is the visual art of the Celtic Revival (on the whole more notable for literature) from the 18th century to the modern era, which began as a conscious effort by Modern Celts, mostly in the British Isles, to express self-identification and nationalism, and became popular well beyond the Celtic nations, and whose style is still current in various popular forms, from Celtic cross funerary monuments to interlace tattoos. Coinciding with the beginnings of a coherent archaeological understanding of the earlier periods, the style self-consciously used motifs closely copied from works of the earlier periods, more often the Insular than the Iron Age. Another influence was that of late La Tène \\"vegetal\\" art on the Art Nouveau movement. Typically, Celtic art is ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature central to the classical tradition, often involving complex symbolism. Celtic art has used a variety of styles and has shown influences from other cultures in their knotwork, spirals, key patterns, lettering, zoomorphics, plant forms and human figures. As the archaeologist Catherine Johns put it: \\"Common to Celtic art over a wide chronological and geographical span is an exquisite sense of balance in the layout and development of patterns. Curvilinear forms are set out so that positive and negative, filled areas and spaces form a harmonious whole. Control and restraint were exercised in the use of surface texturing and relief. Very complex curvilinear patterns were designed to cover precisely the most awkward and irregularly shaped surfaces\\".Johns, 24 Background The ancient peoples now called \\"Celts\\" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples.Sykes, Brian \\"Saxons, Vikings, and Celts\\" (2008) W.W. Norton & Co. NY, pp. 281–284. The extent to which \\"Celtic\\" language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods remains very uncertain and controversial. Carved stone ball from Towie in Aberdeenshire, dated from 3200-2500 BC\\"Carved stone ball\\" . National Museums of Scotland. Retrieved 22 March 2008. Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages. The term \\"Celt\\" was used in classical times as a synonym for the Gauls (Κελτοι, Celtae). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as Edward Lhuyd brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the Brythonic—and Goidelic—speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland. Then in the 18th century the interest in \\"primitivism\\", which led to the idea of the \\"noble savage\\", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and Druidic. The \\"Irish revival\\" came after the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829 as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the \\"Celtic Revival\\". Pre-Celtic periods The earliest archaeological culture that is conventionally termed Celtic, the Hallstatt culture (from \\"Hallstatt C\\" onwards), comes from the early European Iron Age, ca. 800-450 BC. Nonetheless the art of this and later periods reflects considerable continuity, and some long-term correspondences, with earlier art from the same regions, which may reflect the emphasis in recent scholarship on \\"Celticization\\" by acculturation among a relatively static population, as opposed to older theories of migrations and invasions. Megalithic art across much of the world uses a similar mysterious vocabulary of circles, spirals and other curved shapes, but it is striking that the most numerous remains in Europe are the large monuments, with many rock drawings left by the Neolithic Boyne Valley culture in Ireland, within a few miles of centres for Early Medieval Insular art some 4,000 years later. Other centres such as Brittany are also in areas that remain defined as Celtic today. Other correspondences are between the gold lunulas and large collars of Bronze Age Ireland and Europe and the torcs of Iron Age Celts, all elaborate ornaments worn round the neck. The trumpet shaped terminations of various types of Bronze Age Irish jewellery are also reminiscent of motifs popular in later Celtic decoration. Iron Age; Early Celtic art Stone head from Mšecké Žehrovice, Czech Republic, wearing a torc, late La Tène culture Unlike the rural culture of Iron Age inhabitants of the modern \\"Celtic nations\\", Continental Celtic culture in the Iron Age featured many large fortified settlements, some very large, for which the Roman word for \\"town\\", oppidum, is now used. The elites of these societies had considerable wealth, and imported large and expensive, sometimes frankly flashy, objects from neighbouring cultures, some of which have been recovered from graves. The work of the German émigré to Oxford, Paul Jacobsthal, remains the foundation of the study of the art of the period, especially his Early Celtic Art of 1944.Raftery, 184-185; for a preview or summary, see Jacobsthal (1935), and for a long summary in a review see Hawkes. The Halstatt culture produced art with geometric ornament, but marked by patterns of straight lines and rectangles rather than curves; the patterning is often intricate, and fills all the space available, and at least in this respect looks forward to later Celtic styles. Linguists are generally satisfied that the Halstatt culture originated among people speaking Celtic languages, but art historians often avoid describing Halstatt art as \\"Celtic\\". As Halstatt society became increasingly rich and, despite being entirely land-locked in its main zone, linked by trade to other cultures, especially in the Mediterranean, imported objects in radically different styles begin to appear, even including Chinese silks. A famous example is the Greek krater from the Vix Grave in Burgundy, which was made in Magna Graecia (the Greek south of Italy) c. 530 BC, some decades before it was deposited. It is a huge bronze wine-mixing vessel, with a capacity of 1,100 litres.Le Musée du Pays Châtillonnais Vix Krater (in French). Another huge Greek vessel in the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave is decorated with three recumbent lions lying on the rim, one of which is a replacement by a Celtic artist that makes little attempt to copy the Greek style of the others.Boardman Forms characteristic of Hallstatt culture can be found as far from the main Central European area of the culture as Ireland, but mixed with local types and styles.NMI, 125-126 Sculpture from Roquepertuse, including \\"skull-niches\\" and seated figures Figures of animals and humans do appear, especially in works with a religious element. Among the most spectacular objects are \\"cult wagons\\" in bronze, which are large wheeled trolleys containing crowded groups of standing figures, sometimes with a large bowl mounted on a shaft at the centre of the platform, probably for offerings to gods; a few examples have been found in graves. The figures are relatively simply modelled, without much success in detailed anatomical naturalism compared to cultures further south, but often achieving an impressive effect. There are also a number of single stone figures, often with a \\"leaf crown\\" — two flattish rounded projections, \\"resembling a pair of bloated commas\\", rising behind and to the side of the head, probably a sign of divinity.Raftery, 186 Human heads alone, without bodies, are far more common, frequently appearing in relief on all sorts of objects. In the La Tène period faces often (along with bird's heads) emerge from decoration that at first looks abstract, or plant-based. Games are played with faces that change when they are viewed from different directions. In figures showing the whole body, the head is often over-large. There is evidence that the human head had a special importance in Celtic religious beliefs.Green, 121-126, 138-142 The most elaborate ensembles of stone sculpture, including reliefs, come from southern France, at Roquepertuse and Entremont, close to areas colonized by the Greeks. It is possible that similar groups in wood were widespread. Roquepertuse seems to have been a religious sanctuary, whose stonework includes what are thought to have been niches where the heads or skulls of enemies were placed. These are dated to the 3rd century BC, or sometimes earlier. In general, the number of high-quality finds is not large, especially when compared to the number of survivals from the contemporary Mediterranean cultures, and there is a very clear division between elite objects and the much plainer goods used by the majority of the people. There are many torcs and swords (the La Tène site produced over 3,000 swords, apparently votive offeringsBritish Museum highlights , La Tène), but the best-known finds, like the Czech head above, the shoe plaques from Hochdorf and the Waterloo Helmet, often have no similar other finds for comparison. Clearly religious content in art is rare, but little is known about the significance that most of the decoration of practical objects had for its makers, and the subject and meaning of the few objects without a practical function is equally unclear. =Hallstatt gallery= File:Linz Schlossmuseum - Uttendorf Halsreifen.jpgLate Hallstatt gold collar from Austria, c. 550 BC File:Hochdorf golden shoes ornaments.jpgGold shoe plaques from the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave, Germany, c. 530 BC File:Gefässe Hohmichele.jpgPottery from Heuneburg, Germany File:Cratère de Vix 0023.jpgThe imported Greek Vix Krater, found in the Vix Grave, France. La Tène style Torc from the Vix Grave, 480 BC About 500 BC the La Tène style, named after a site in Switzerland, appeared rather suddenly, coinciding with some kind of societal upheaval that involved a shift of the major centres in a north-westerly direction. The central area where rich sites are especially found is in northern France and western Germany, but over the next three centuries the style spread very widely, as far as Ireland, Italy and modern Hungary. In some places the Celts were aggressive raiders and invaders, but elsewhere the spread of Celtic material culture may have involved only small movements of people, or none at all. Early La Tène style adapted ornamental motifs from foreign cultures into something distinctly new; the complicated brew of influences including Scythian art and that of the Greeks and Etruscans among others. The occupation by the Persian Achaemenid Empire of Thrace and Macedonia around 500 BC is a factor of uncertain importance.Sandars, 226-233; Laings, 34-35 La Tène style is \\"a highly stylised curvilinear art based mainly on classical vegetable and foliage motifs such as leafy palmette forms, vines, tendrils and lotus flowers together with spirals, S-scrolls, lyre and trumpet shapes\\".NMI, 126 The most lavish objects, whose imperishable materials tend to mean they are the best preserved other than pottery, do not refute the stereotypical views of the Celts that are found in classical authors, where they are represented as mainly interested in feasting and fighting, as well as ostentatious display. Society was dominated by a warrior aristocracy and military equipment, even if in ceremonial versions, and containers for drink, represent most of the largest and most spectacular finds, other than jewellery.Green, Chapters 2 and 3 Unfortunately for the archaeologist, the rich \\"princely\\" burials characteristic of the Hallstatt period greatly reduce, at least partly because of a change from inhumation burials to cremation.Green, 21-26; 72-73 The torc was evidently a key marker of status and very widely worn, in a range of metals no doubt reflecting the wealth and status of the owner. Bracelets and armlets were also common.Green, 72-79 An exception to the general lack of depictions of the human figure, and of the failure of wooden objects to survive, are certain water sites from which large numbers of small carved figures of body parts or whole human figures have been recovered, which are assumed to be votive offerings representing the location of the ailment of the supplicant. The largest of these, at Source-de-la-Roche, Chamalières, France, produced over 10,000 fragments, mostly now at Clermont-Ferrand.Megaws; in the Musée Bargoin. Bronze fitting from France in the \\"vegetal\\" style Several phases of the style are distinguished, under a variety of names, including numeric (De Navarro) and alphabetic series. Generally, there is broad agreement on how to demarcate the phases, but the names used differ, and that they followed each other in chronological sequence is now much less certain. In a version of Jacobsthal's division, the \\"early\\" or \\"strict\\" phase, De Navarro I, where the imported motifs remain recognisable, is succeeded by the \\"vegetal\\", \\"Continuous Vegetal\\", \\"Waldalgesheim style\\", or De Navarro II, where ornament is \\"typically dominated by continuously moving tendrils of various types, twisting and turning in restless motion across the surface\\". After about 300 BC the style, now De Navarro III, can be divided into \\"plastic\\" and \\"sword\\" styles, the latter mainly found on scabbards and the former featuring decoration in high relief. One scholar, Vincent Megaw, has defined a \\"Disney style\\" of cartoon-like animal heads within the plastic style, and also an \\"Oppida period art, c 125–c 50 BC\\". De Navarro distinguishes the \\"insular\\" art of the British Isles, up to about 100 BC, as Style IV, followed by a Style V,Megaws (Oppida period); Megaw and Megaw, 10-11, with more detail on these schemes; Laings, 41-42, 94-95; also see Harding, 119 and the separateness of Insular Celtic styles is widely recognised.Sandars, 233 and Chapter 9; Laings, 94 The Great Torc from Snettisham, England, 1st century BC. The often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \\"foreign\\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. So a torc in the rich Vix Grave terminates in large balls in a way found in many others, but here the ends of the ring are formed as the paws of a lion or similar beast, without making a logical connection to the balls, and on the outside of the ring two tiny winged horses sit on finely worked plaques. The effect is impressive but somewhat incongruous compared to an equally ostentatious British torc from the Snettisham Hoard that is made 400 years later and uses a style that has matured and harmonized the elements making it up. The 1st century BC Gundestrup cauldron, is the largest surviving piece of European Iron Age silver (diameter 69 cm, height 42 cm), but though much of its iconography seems clearly to be Celtic, much of it is not, and its style is much debated; it may well be of Thracian manufacture. To further confuse matters, it was found in a bog in north Denmark.Bergquist, A K & Taylor, T F (1987), “The origin of the Gundestrup cauldron”, Antiquity 61: 10-24 The Agris Helmet in gold leaf over bronze clearly shows the Mediterranean origin of its decorative motifs. By the 3rd century BC Celts began to produce coinage, imitating Greek and later Roman types, at first fairly closely, but gradually allowing their own taste to take over, so that versions based on sober classical heads sprout huge wavy masses of hair several times larger than their faces, and horses become formed of a series of vigorously curved elements. A form apparently unique to southern Britain was the mirror with a handle and complex decoration, mostly engraved, on the back of the bronze plate; the front side being highly polished to act as the mirror. Each of the more than 50 mirrors found has a unique design, but the essentially circular shape of the mirror presumably dictated the sophisticated abstract curvilinear motifs that dominate their decoration.Celtic mirrors website , with good pictures and information. The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan, 2nd century AD Romano-British, with enamel. Despite the importance of Ireland for Early Medieval Celtic art, the number of artefacts showing La Tène style found in Ireland is small, though they are often of very high quality. Some aspects of Hallstatt metalwork had appeared in Ireland, such as scabbard chapes, but the La Tène style is not found in Ireland before some point between 350-150 BC, and until the latter date is mostly found in modern Northern Ireland, notably in a series of engraved scabbard plates. Thereafter, despite Ireland remaining outside the Roman Empire that engulfed the Continental and British Celtic cultures, Irish art is subject to continuous influence from outside, through trade and probably periodic influxes of refugees from Britain, both before and after the Roman invasion. It remains uncertain whether some of the most notable objects found from the period were made in Ireland or elsewhere, as far away as Germany and Egypt in specific cases.NMI, 127-133 But in Scotland and the western parts of Britain where the Romans and later the Anglo-Saxons were largely held back, versions of the La Tène style remained in use until it became an important component of the new Insular style that developed to meet the needs of newly Christianized populations. Indeed, in northern England and Scotland most finds post-date the Roman invasion of the south.Garrow, 2, google books However, while there are fine Irish finds from the 1st and 2nd centuries, there is little or nothing in La Tène style from the 3rd and 4th centuries, a period of instability in Ireland.NMI, 134 After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalized styles. Roman Britain produced a number of items using Roman forms such as the fibula but with La Tène style ornament, whose dating can be difficult,Laings, 125-130 for example a \\"hinged brass collar\\" from around the time of the Roman conquest shows Celtic decoration in a Roman context.Hinged brass collar , British Museum Britain also made more use of enamel than most of the Empire, and on larger objects, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom derived from Insular decoration was an important element. Enamel decoration on penannular brooches, \\"dragonesque\\" brooches, and hanging bowls appears to demonstrate a continuity in Celtic decoration between works like the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan and the flowering of Christian Insular art from the 6th century onwards.

The Tara Brooch Early Middle Ages Folio 27r from the 8th-century Lindisfarne Gospels contains the incipit Liber generationis of the Gospel of Matthew. =Post-Roman Ireland and Britain= Celtic art in the Middle Ages was practiced by the peoples of Ireland and parts of Britain in the 700-year period from the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, to the establishment of Romanesque art in the 12th century. Through the Hiberno-Scottish mission the style was influential in the development of art throughout Northern Europe. In Ireland an unbroken Celtic heritage existed from before and throughout the Roman era of Britain, which had never reached the island, though in fact Irish objects in La Tène style are very rare from the Late Roman period. The 5th to 7th centuries were a continuation of late Iron Age La Tène art, with also many signs of the Roman and Romano-British influences that had gradually penetrated there.NMI, 134, 172-173 With the arrival of Christianity, Irish art was influenced by both Mediterranean and Germanic traditions, the latter through Irish contacts with the Anglo-Saxons, creating what is called the Insular or Hiberno-Saxon style, which had its golden age in the 8th and early 9th centuries before Viking raids severely disrupted monastic life. Late in the period Scandinavian influences were added through the Vikings and mixed Norse-Gael populations, then original Celtic work came to end with the Norman invasion in 1169–1170 and the subsequent introduction of the general European Romanesque style. In the 7th and 9th centuries Irish Celtic missionaries travelled to Northumbria in Britain and brought with them the Irish tradition of manuscript illumination, which came into contact with Anglo-Saxon metalworking knowledge and motifs. In the monasteries of Northumbria these skills fused and were probably transmitted back to Scotland and Ireland from there, also influencing the Anglo-Saxon art of the rest of England. Some of the metalwork masterpieces created include the Tara Brooch, the Ardagh Chalice and the Derrynaflan Chalice. New techniques employed were filigree and chip carving, while new motifs included interlace patterns and animal ornamentation. The Book of Durrow is the earliest complete insular script illuminated Gospel Book and by about 700, with the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Hiberno-Saxon style was fully developed with detailed carpet pages that seem to glow with a wide palette of colours. The art form reached its peak in the late 8th century with the Book of Kells, the most elaborate Insular manuscript. Anti-classical Insular artistic styles were carried to mission centres on the Continent and had a continuing impact on Carolingian, Romanesque and Gothic art for the rest of the Middle Ages. In the 9th and 11th century plain silver became a popular medium in Anglo-Saxon England, probably because of the increased amount in circulation due to Viking trading and raiding, and it was during this time a number of magnificent silver penannular brooches were created in Ireland. Around the same time manuscript production began to decline, and although it has often been blamed on the Vikings, this is debatable given the decline began before the Vikings arrived. Sculpture began to flourish in the form of the \\"high cross\\", large stone crosses that held biblical scenes in carved relief. This art form reached its apex in the early 10th century and has left many fine examples such as Muiredach's Cross at Monasterboice and the Ahenny High Cross. Christ in Majesty, Book of Kells. The impact of the Vikings on Irish art is not seen until the late 11th century when Irish metal work begins to imitate the Scandinavian Ringerike and Urnes styles, for example the Cross of Cong and Shrine of Manchan. These influences were found not just in the Norse centre of Dublin, but throughout the countryside in stone monuments such as the Dorty Cross at Kilfenora and crosses at the Rock of Cashel.NMI, 216-219;St Fachtnan, Kilfenora in the Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland Some Insular manuscripts may have been produced in Wales, including the 8th century Lichfield Gospels and Hereford Gospels.Peter Lord, Medieval Vision: The Visual Culture of Wales. University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2003, pg. 25; see the wikipedia articles on the two manuscripts for further references. The late Insular Ricemarch Psalter from the 11th century was certainly written in Wales, and also shows strong Viking influence. Art from historic Dumnonia, modern Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Brittany on the Atlantic seaboard is now fairly sparsely attested and hence less well known as these areas later became incorporated into England (and France) in the medieval and Early Modern period.http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol33/33_001_006.pdf However archaeological studies at sites such as Cadbury Castle, Somerset,Alcock, L. 1995 Cadbury Castle: The Early Medieval Archaeology, University of Wales; see also the South Cadbury Environs Project , Oxford University Tintagel, Tintagel Region Archaeological Landscape , University of Winchester and more recently at Ipplepen The Ipplepen project , University of Exeter indicate a highly sophisticated largely literate society with strong influence and connections with both the Byzantine Mediterranean as well as the Atlantic Irish, and British in Wales and the 'Old North'. Many crosses, memorials and tombstones such as King Doniert's Stone, the Drustanus stone and the notorious Artognou stone show evidence for a surprisingly cosmopolitan sub-Roman population speaking and writing in both Brittonic and Latin and with at least some knowledge of Ogham indicated by several extant stones in the region. Breton and especially Cornish manuscripts are exceedingly rare survivals but include the Bodmin manumissionsBodmin Gospels, British Library , Additional MS 9381 demonstrating a regional form of the Insular style. King Doniert's Stone, c.875 =Picts (Scotland)= From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the Picts is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts. The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including Iona, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south. After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced Pictish art, with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones. The heavy silver Whitecleuch Chain has Pictish symbols on its terminals, and appears to be an equivalent to a torc. The symbols are also found on plaques from the Norrie's Law hoard. These are thought to be relatively early pieces. The St Ninian's Isle Treasure of silver penannular brooches, bowls and other items comes from off the coast of Pictland and is often regarded as mostly of Pictish manufacture, representing the best survival of Late Pictish metalwork, from about 800 AD. Pictish stones are assigned by scholars to 3 classes. Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the Pictish Beast, and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror). The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others. This is often taken to symbolise a woman. Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east Scotland from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. Good examples include the Dunnichen and Aberlemno stones (Angus), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones (Aberdeenshire). Pictish symbols and a rider on a Pictish stone Class II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces. The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key- pattern or scrollwork, in the Insular style. On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes. Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so. The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures. Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology. Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle (Perthshire), Aberlemno (Angus), Nigg, Shandwick and Hilton of Cadboll (Easter Ross). Class III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols. Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, Perthshire). These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century. Examples include the sarcophagus and the large collection of cross-slabs at St Andrews (Fife). The following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle (Perthshire), St Vigeans (Angus) and St Andrew's Cathedral (Fife) (all Historic Scotland), the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, Forfar (Angus), Inverness Museum, Groam House Museum, Rosemarkie and Tarbat Discovery Centre, Portmahomack (both Easter Ross) and Tankerness House Museum, Kirkwall, Orkney. Celtic revival Cover of The Boys' Cuchulain, 1904, in fact closer to Viking Urnes style. The revival of interest in Celtic visual art came sometime later than the revived interest in Celtic literature. By the 1840s reproduction Celtic brooches and other forms of metalwork were fashionable, initially in Dublin, but later in Edinburgh, London and other countries. Interest was stimulated by the discovery in 1850 of the Tara Brooch, which was seen in London and Paris over the next decades. The late 19th century reintroduction of monumental Celtic crosses for graves and other memorials has arguably been the most enduring aspect of the revival, one that has spread well outside areas and populations with a specific Celtic heritage. Interlace typically features on these and has also been used as a style of architectural decoration, especially in America around 1900, by architects such as Louis Sullivan, and in stained glass and wall stenciling by Thomas A. O'Shaughnessy, both based in Chicago with its large Irish-American population. The \\"plastic style\\" of early Celtic art was one of the elements feeding into Art Nouveau decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the Manxman Archibald Knox, who did much work for Liberty & Co. The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland embraced the Celtic style early on, but began to back away in the 1920s. The governor of the National Gallery of Ireland, Thomas Bodkin, writing in The Studio magazine in 1921, drew attention to the decline in Celtic ornament in the Sixth Exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland said, \\"National art all over the world has burst long ago, the narrow boundaries within which it is cradled, and grows more cosmopolitan in spirit with each succeeding generation.\\" George Atkinson, writing the foreword to the catalogue of that same exhibit emphasized the society's disapproval of any undue emphasis on Celtic ornament at the expense of good design. \\"Special pleading on behalf of the national traditional ornament is no longer justifiable.”The style had served the nationalist cause as an emblem of a distinct Irish culture, but soon intellectual fashions abandoned Celtic art as nostalgically looking backwards.Stephen Walker, The Modern History of Celtic Jewellery, Walker Metalsmiths, Andover, NY 2013 Interlace, which is still seen as a \\"Celtic\\" form of decoration—somewhat ignoring its Germanic origins and equally prominent place in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian medieval art—has remained a motif in many forms of popular design, especially in Celtic countries, and above all Ireland, where it remains a national style signature. In recent decades it has been used worldwide in tattoos, and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-Dark Ages setting. The Secret of Kells is an animated feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the Book of Kells which makes much use of Insular design. By the 1980s a new Celtic Revival had begun, which continues to this day. Often this late 20th- century movement is referred to as the Celtic Renaissance.Michael Carroll, post 1170 in Discussion of Celtic Art, Yahoo Groups 2001, accessed Aug. 6, 2016 By the 1990s the number of new artists, craftsmen, designers and retailers specializing in Celtic jewelry and crafts was rapidly increasing. The Celtic Renaissance has been an international phenomenon, with participants no longer confined to just the Old-World Celtic countries.Walker, pg 12–13 June 9 was designated International Day of Celtic Art in 2017 by a groups of contemporary Celtic artists and enthusiasts. The day is an occasion for exhibits, promotions, workshops and demonstrations. Celtic art types and terms A hanging bowl from Sutton Hoo *Hanging bowl. According to the traditional theory, these were created by Celtic craftsmen during the time of the Anglo-Saxon conquests of England. They were based on a Roman design, usually made of copper alloy with 3 or 4 suspension loops along the top rim, from which they were designed to be hung, perhaps from roof-beams or within a tripod. Their art-historical interest mainly derives from the round decorated plaques, often with enamel, that most have along their rims. Some of the finest examples are found in the hoard at Sutton Hoo (625) which are enamelled. The knowledge of their manufacture spread to Scotland and Ireland in the 8th century. However, although their styles continue popular Romano- British traditions, the assumption that they were made in Ireland is now questioned. *Carpet page. An illuminated manuscript page decorated entirely in ornamentation. In Hiberno-Saxon tradition this was a standard feature of Gospel books, with one page as an introduction to each Gospel. Usually made in a geometric or interlace pattern, often framing a central cross. The earliest known example is the 7th century Bobbio Orosius. *High cross. A tall stone standing cross, usually of Celtic cross form. Decoration is abstract often with figures in carved relief, especially crucifixions, but in some cases complex multi-scene schemes. Most common in Ireland, but also in Great Britain and near continental mission centres. *Pictish stone. A cross-slab--a rectangular slab of rock with a cross carved in relief on the slab face, with other pictures and shapes carved throughout. Organised into three Classes, based on the period of origin. *Insular art or the Hiberno-Saxon style, from the 6th to 9th centuries. The fusion of pre-Christian Celtic and Anglo-Saxon metalworking styles, applied to the new form of the religious illuminated manuscript, as well as sculpture and secular and church metalwork. Also includes influences from post-classical Europe, and later Viking decorative styles. The peak of the style in manuscripts occurred when Irish Celtic missionaries traveled to Northumbria in the 7th and 8th centuries. Produced some of the most outstanding Celtic art of the Middle Ages in illuminated manuscripts, metalworking and sculpture. *Celtic calendar.

It is administratively part of the Municipality of the District of West Hants. The community is located at the western boundary between Hants County and Kings County, along the west bank of the Avon River's tidal estuary. The community is best known for its former industries, including shipbuilding, a pulp mill, as well a marine terminal that once loaded gypsum, mined near Windsor. The community is the resting place of Victoria Cross recipient William Hall. Hantsport (GAA) is rooted in deep sports tradition such as the Hantsport Shamrock but there is no tradition deeper than \\"The Townies\\" vs \\"The Outta Townies\\" football games once held on Cedar ave. The Townies put together many great seasons but the power house Outta Townies, who always seemed to be running downhill, walked away with the championship and most of all, bragging rights. History The area around Hantsport was known to the Miꞌkmaq as Kakagwek meaning \\"place where meat is sliced and dried\\" and the town is still home to a small Miꞌkmaq community known as the Glooscap First Nation or Pesikitk.Glooscap First Nation 2006 CensusRand, Rev.

Although no Acadians are known to have lived on the lands within the boundary of Hantsport proper, the area was part of the Acadian parish of Paroisse de Sainte Famille (established in 1698). Etienne Rivet and his progeny farmed the nearby marshlands of the Halfway River (currently the boundary between the town and the community of Mount Denson, Nova Scotia) and his son, Etienne, operated a mill on the river near where the marshlands meet the uplands on the town's southern boundary.Robertson, Allen B. Tide & Timber - Hantsport , Nova Scotia, 1795-1995. Lancelot Press, Hantsport, 1995MacMechan, Archibald, ed. Nova Scotia Archives II, A Calendar of Two Letter-Books and One Commission-Book in the Possession of the Government of Nova Scotia, 1713-1741. Herald Printing House, Halifax, NS. 1900. After the Expulsion of the Acadians, the Acadian region of Piziquid was formed into the Township of Falmouth. These lands were granted to New England Planters, and officers of the British army. Colonel Henry Denny Denson, a retired British officer, was granted an extensive tract of land (Mount Denson), which included the lands lying north of the Halfway River and south of the Horton Township boundary. In 1789, after Denson's death, his consort and heir, Martha Whitfield, sold Lots Three & Four (the area of Hantsport) to an Edward Barker. Edward Barker (born at Lowdham, Nottinghamshire, England, 1745) was a British soldier, having arrived in Halifax in 1769 as a member of the 59th Regiment of Foot. In the early 1770s he mustered out of the army and by 1774 was at Falmouth, having married Rebecca Chadwick (see note) It is uncertain as to whether Rebecca was a Chadwick or a Mitchener - see reference: http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~agbfamily/bcomp.htm of Newport, Rhode Island. He appears to have either worked on Abel Mitchener lands or rented farm lands until 1788 when he purchased land in Falmouth. A year later Barker purchased the Hantsport lots and soon thereafter moved his family to Hantsport. Barker's arrival marks the beginning of the settlement which was initially known as \\"Halfway River\\" being the point halfway between Grand-Pré and Windsor.Nova Scotia Archives: Place Names of Nova Scotia, \\"Hantsport\\", p. 78-79 The Hantsport train station was built in the Craftsman style and is a registered heritage building. It is no longer in use as a passenger facility. Shipbuilding (see Ezra Churchill) emerged as a major industry in the 19th century and the town produced a large number of wooden sailing vessels and some steam vessels before the decline of wooden shipbuilding in the late 1800s. Notable vessels included the barque Hamburg, the largest three masted barque ever built in Canada, and the barque Plymouth, famous for the diaries of Alice Coalfleet, who raised a family aboard her. Hantsport shipbuilders active to the very end of the age of sail in the late 19th century and also built tugs and one steamship before wooden shipbuilding collapsed in the early 1900s. William Hall, an African-Canadian mariner born near Hantsport, was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1857 and is buried at a monument beside the Hantsport Baptist Church. The arrival of the Windsor and Annapolis Railway in 1869 stimulated a number of local manufacturers which provided some relief from the demise of shipbuilding. A cluster of small factories and fruit warehouses grew around the Hantsport station. Gypsum exports emerged as a major employer in the 20th Century, followed by the pulp mill and paper factory of the Minas Basin Pulp and Power Company established by the Jodrey family in the 1920s. Artifacts from the town's history are preserved at Churchill House, Hantsport, the restored mansion of the Churchill shipbuilding family (see Ezra Churchill) which serves as a community centre and museum. During the 20th century, the port was used for shipping gypsum which was quarried at two locations east of Windsor and shipped to Hantsport using the Dominion Atlantic Railway, and later the Windsor and Hantsport Railway which ran frequent gypsum trains controlled by the Hantsport station. The marine terminal used a loader to move gypsum from the storage building to waiting ships and was one of the fastest ship-loaders in the world, necessitated by the fact that the extreme tides in the Minas Basin require ships to enter and leave the port within a four- to five-hour period. Operations at Fundy Gypsum Company's ship loading facility were idled in early 2011, with the facility permanently closed later in 2011. On November 1, 2012, the Minas Basin Pulp & Power pulp mill, which had been in operation in Hantsport for more than 85 years, announced it would cease all operations. This mill closed in December 2012, resulting in the loss of 135 jobs. The largest remaining employer in Hantsport is CKF Inc., a paper products maker originally founded by the Joudreys to provide a lcola market for the Minas Basin pulp mill, produces Royal Chinet paper plates, as well as egg cartons, cup carriers and other molded pulp products at its plant on the community's waterfront. In the wake of the closures of the marine terminal and the pulp mill, Hantsport town council voted on April 16, 2014 to dissolve its municipal incorporation. The town was formally dissolved into the Municipality of the District of West Hants effective July 1, 2015. Sports have been a significant part of the atmosphere in Hantsport. The Hantsport Hawks junior high team won the regional banner in 2015 and they repeated in 2016. The Hantsport Shamrocks are one of the most well known baseball clubs in Nova Scotia. The Hantsport Bruins are a dynasty in the Hants County Hockey League, winning 7 Howard Dill Cups since 1998. Some say that sports in Hantsport are \\"the glue\\" that holds the town together. In the 2005-06 track and field season, Kira Pederson set the Hantsport Junior High 100 m dash record with a time of 13.34 s, which still holds to this day.

Bush in order to restart orders for nuclear power reactors in the U.S. by providing subsidies for a handful of Generation III+ demonstration plants. The expectation was that these plants would come online by 2010, but it was not met. In March 2017, the leading nuclear-plant maker, Westinghouse Electric Company, filed for bankruptcy due to losing over $9 billion in construction losses from working on two nuclear plants. This loss was partly caused by safety concerns due to the Fukushima disaster, Germany's Energiewende, the growth of solar and wind power, and low natural gas prices. Overview The \\"Nuclear Power 2010 Program\\" was unveiled by the U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham on February 14, 2002 as one means towards addressing the expected need for new power plants. The program is a joint government/industry cost-shared effort to identify sites for new nuclear power plants, to develop and bring to market advanced nuclear plant technologies, evaluate the business case for building new nuclear power plants, and demonstrate untested regulatory processes leading to an industry decision in the next few years to seek Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval to build and operate at least one new advanced nuclear power plant in the United States. Three consortia responded in 2004 to the U.S. Department of Energy's solicitation under the Nuclear Power 2010 initiative and were awarded matching funds. *The Dominion-led consortium includes General Electric (GE) Energy, Hitachi America, and Bechtel Corporation, and has selected General Electric's Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR, a passively safe version of the BWR). *The NuStart Energy Development, LLC consortium consists of DTE Energy, Duke Energy, EDF International North America, Entergy Nuclear, Exelon Generation, Florida Power & Light Co., Progress Energy, SCANA Corporation, Southern Company, GE Energy, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and Westinghouse Electric Company and has chosen the General Electric Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) and the Westinghouse Advanced Passive 1000 (AP1000, a PWR) reactor as candidates. The NuStart consortium was disbanded on 30 June 2012. *The third consortium, led by TVA, includes General Electric, Toshiba, USEC Inc., Global Fuel-Americas, and Bechtel Power Corp., and will develop a feasibility study for a TVA site based on the General Electric Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR). On September 22, 2005, NuStart selected Port Gibson (the Grand Gulf site) and Scottsboro (the Bellefonte site) for new nuclear units. Port Gibson will host an ESBWR (a passively safe version of the BWR) and Scottsboro an AP1000 (a passively safe version of the PWR). Entergy announced it will prepare its own proposal for the River Bend Station in St. Francisville. Also, Constellation Energy of Baltimore had withdrawn its Lusby and Oswego sites from the NuStart finalist list after on September 15 announcing a new joint venture, UniStar Nuclear, with Areva to offer EPR (European Pressurized Reactors) in the U.S.A. Finally, in October, 2005, Progress Energy announced it was considering constructing a new nuclear plant and had begun evaluating potential sites in central Florida. South Carolina Electric & Gas announced on February 10, 2006 that it chose Westinghouse for a plant to be built at the V.C. Summer plant in Jenkinsville, South Carolina. NRG Energy announced in June 2006 that it would explore building two ABWRs at the South Texas Project. Four ABWRs were already operating in Japan at that time. The original goal of bringing two new reactors online by 2010 was missed, and \\"of more than two dozen projects that were considered, only two showed signs of progress and even this progress was uncertain\\". As of March 2017, the Plant Vogtle and V.C. Summer plants (a total of four reactors) in the southeastern U.S. that have been under construction since the late 2000s have been left to an unknown fate.  Energy Policy Act of 2005  The Energy Policy Act of 2005, signed by President George W. Bush on August 8, 2005, has a number of articles related to nuclear power, and three specifically to the 2010 Program. First, the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act was extended to cover private and DOE plants and activities licensed through 2025. Also, the government would cover cost overruns due to regulatory delays, up to $500 million each for the first two new nuclear reactors, and half of the overruns due to such delays (up to $250 million each) for the next four reactors. Delays in construction due to vastly increased regulation were a primary cause of the high cost of some earlier plants. Finally, \\"A production tax credit of 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 6,000 megawatt-hours from new nuclear power plants for the first eight years of their operation, subject to a $125 million annual limit. The production tax credit places nuclear energy on an equal footing with other sources of emission-free power, including wind and closed-loop biomass.\\" The Act also funds a Next Generation Nuclear Plant project at INEEL to produce both electricity and hydrogen. This plant will be a DOE project and does not fall under the 2010 Program. Recent developments Between 2007 and 2009, 13 companies applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for construction and operating licenses to build 25 new nuclear power reactors in the United States. However, the case for widespread nuclear plant construction was eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies, slow electricity demand growth in a weak U.S. economy, lack of financing, and uncertainty following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan after a tsunami. Many license applications for proposed new reactors were suspended or cancelled.Eileen O'Grady. Entergy says nuclear remains costly, Reuters, May 25, 2010.Terry Ganey. AmerenUE pulls plug on project , Columbia Daily Tribune, April 23, 2009. Only a few new reactors will enter service by 2020. These will not be cheaper than coal or natural gas, but they are an attractive investment for utilities because the government mandates that taxpayers pay for construction in advance. In 2013, four aging reactors were permanently closed due to the stringent requirements of the NRC and actions by local politicians.

He was also a movie producer, and Choctaw Indian historian. Ferguson is best known for writing the bestselling songs \\"On the Wings of a Dove\\" and \\"The Carroll County Accident\\". The \\"Carroll County Accident\\" won the Country Music Association Song of the Year in 1969. In 1983 \\"Wings of a Dove\\" was featured in the movie Tender Mercies starring Robert Duvall. In 1987, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) awarded Ferguson with the \\"million air\\" plays for the \\"Wings of a Dove.\\" The country song \\"Carroll County Accident\\", recorded by Porter Wagoner, made No. 2 on the Billboard country singles chart (No. 92 pop) and No. 1 on the Cash Box country singles chart. The tune was also recorded by Wagoner's longtime duet partner Dolly Parton. Ferguson married twice, first to Harvie June Van (1950s/60s) then to Martha Jean Lewis (1970 to 2001). Biography =Early life and education= Ferguson was born in Willow Springs, Missouri, the third son of John Carl and Mary Willie Boles Ferguson. His brothers were John Carl, Alan Claude, and Paul Eugene. John Carl attended the United States Naval Academy and graduated in 1944. Alan Claude became a renowned forest ranger. Paul Eugene, as an enlisted sailor, witnessed many Pacific Proving Grounds atomic tests while aboard the USS Estes. The Fergusons have a rich legacy including ancestors whom participated in the American Revolution. While in high school, Ferguson was a typesetter at the local newspaper, a fire tower lookout for the U.S. Forest Service, and a member of the Missouri State Guard during World War II. After graduating from high school in 1945, he entered the U.S. Army. He attained the rank of sergeant and served as a radioman for two winters in Alaska. He tested military equipment under Arctic conditions. He went on to study at Southwest Missouri State University. After discharge from the Army, Ferguson went out West and worked for the U.S. Forest Service as a fire tower lookout and trail crew boss. He also worked as a laborer in the wheat fields and a typesetter for the newspaper in Moses Lake, Washington. He led the Boy Scout Troop from that city to the Boy Scout Jamboree at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1950. Ferguson then entered Washington State College, Pullman, Washington, under the GI Bill and earned a BS in Speech. He specialized in radio and television production. While in college, Ferguson joined a U.S. Marine Reserve unit. He was called to duty during the Korean War (1950–1952). Ferguson served as a Drill Instructor at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and producer of Marine training motion pictures. =Tennessee Game and Fish Commission= From about 1955-1961, Ferguson worked at the Tennessee Game and Fish Commission, headquartered in Nashville, where he produced films for the agency.\\"Bob Ferguson\\", Clarionledger, 23 Jul 2001, accessed 16 Mar 2009 In 1959, Ferguson was to produce for the commission a 39 segment series on hunting, fishing, and wildlife subjects. In 1960, the North American Wildlife Conservation Association named his production The World Outdoors the \\"Best Motion Picture of the Year.\\" The World Outdoors influenced many wildlife television shows, most notably Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom series. While working there, Ferguson also started in the music business. In 1958 he wrote his first multi-million seller song \\"On the Wings of a Dove\\". It was recorded by Ferlin Husky whom Ferguson met in El Cajon, California. It has since been recorded by many artists and in many languages around the world. It was featured in the movie Tender Mercies (1983), starring Robert Duvall. In 1987, \\"Wings of a Dove\\" received BMI's \\"One million airplays\\" Award. Performing with Husky, Ferguson played a character called Eli Possumtrout in The Good Old Days, a motion picture produced by the Tennessee Game and Fish Commission. =Nashville record producer= After graduation from college, Ferguson moved to Nashville, Tennessee, as manager for Ferlin Husky. The success of his song \\"On the Wings of a Dove\\" enabled Ferguson to turn full- time to music. He became a senior producer with RCA Victor, where he helped create the Nashville Sound of the 1950s and 1960s. He served as executive assistant to Chet Atkins until his retirement. While there, he produced records, many in RCA Studio A. He particularly worked with producing the acts of Porter Wagoner, Dolly Parton, (from 1967 - 75 he produced nearly all of Wagoner and Parton's duet albums, as well as all of their respective solo releases during that time) and Connie Smith. He also produced records by Floyd Cramer, Danny Davis, The Browns, Helen Cornelius, Lester Flatt, Homer and Jethro, Charlie Pride and many others. With Atkins, he played a major role in the development of what was to become known as the Nashville Sound and elevated Nashville as the country music capital of the world. He also played a major role in developing the Country Music Association. His first successful single was with The Avons. Ferguson developed a comedy role as \\"Grandpappy Eli Possumtrot\\", a name which he took from a crossroad community near his childhood home in the Ozarks. In that role, he recorded his own song, \\"Eli's Blue\\", a lament about a man who accidentally shot his dog. Ferguson wrote several other songs, including the million seller, \\"Carroll County Accident\\", first recorded by Porter Wagoner. In 1969 it received a Country Music Award for the \\"Song of the Year\\". In the 1960s Ferguson also wrote \\"Natividad\\", a Christmas song, and \\"Choctaw Saturday Night\\", a tribute to Choctaw Native Americans. The country song \\"Carroll County Accident\\" was written when Ferguson passed through Carroll County when driving from Nashville to a concert for the Choctaw Indians in Philadelphia, Miss., according to an interview Ferguson granted with Steve Eng for the Wagoner biography A Satisfied Mind. He recounted that he passed a sign for Carroll County in Tennessee, which inspired the song's title, and when he saw a sign for Carroll County in Mississippi the song was a finished work. Wagoner took the song to No. 2 on the Billboard country singles chart (No. 92 pop) and No. 1 on the Cash Box country singles chart. The tune was also recorded by Wagoner's longtime duet partner Dolly Parton. =Writer= Bob Ferguson and Dolly Parton at RCA Records, signing her initial recording contract for RCA, 1967. With Jesse Burt as co-author, Ferguson wrote two books: So You Want to be in Music and Southeastern Indians: Then and Now. So You Want to be in Music is a book about the music industry for aspiring songwriting and recording professionals. Southeastern Indians: Then and Now is a general-interest book about Native Americans of the Deep South, covering the Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole tribes. =Anthropology= While working at RCA, Ferguson earned a Master's Degree in anthropology from Vanderbilt University. He served as volunteer Project Director and President of Southeastern Indian Antiquities Survey and in that role oversaw the survey, recovery, and preservation of remains and artifacts unearthed during construction in the Nashville area. One startling discovery was the remains of the first saber-toothed tiger found east of the Mississippi River. It was found during construction of the Regions Center, former First American Bank building, in downtown Nashville. On September 25, 1997, the newly established hockey team, the Nashville Predators, adopted the head of a saber-toothed tiger as their logo. =Final years and death= After his retirement from RCA, Ferguson moved his family to live near the reservation of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in Philadelphia, Mississippi. He had worked in various capacities with the tribe since the 1950s. There he served as editor of the Choctaw Times, and historian and audio- visual producer for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. In that role, he helped establish the Museum of the Southern Indian (Choctaw Museum) in 1981. He also worked part-time as promotional director of the Chucalissa Prehistoric Indian Village in Memphis, Tennessee. \\"Bob Ferguson\\" , Mississippi History Newsletter, Sept. 2001, accessed 16 Mar 2009 In 1983, he created the foundation for Choctaw Video Productions and created numerous tribal productions. In 1987, Ferguson established WHTV as local cable service for Pearl River/Philadelphia, Mississippi. He retired from that position in 1998, when he was also named Tribal Historian Emeritus. He established the tribe's organic gardening program in 1978. Robert Bruce \\"Bob\\" Ferguson, Sr. died of Cancer on Sunday, July 22, 2001 at 1:05 a.m. in the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi.

However, many of these provisions were limited in scope, and ultimately required the voluntary cooperation of mortgagors and creditors. In addition, section 75, as it was originally conceived, was a temporary measure. It was scheduled to expire on March 3, 1938. The Frazier-Lemke Act expanded the scope of section 75, providing for stronger protections available to farmers operating under bankruptcy protection. These changes too were initially temporary, but they were extended a number of times until they ultimately expired on March 31, 1949. By and large, after the expiration of section 75, farmers were subject to the same rules of bankruptcy as other debtors. The application of the same rules was the case after the passage of the Bankruptcy Code of 1976 until 1986. =Passage= Chapter 12 was added to the Bankruptcy Code in 1986 by the Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986.Pub. L. No. 99-554Agricultural Finance and Credit, Jonathan M. Bishoff, Nova Publishers, 2008, , , pp. 91–92. It went into effect on November 26, 1986. The modification of the bankruptcy code were intended as an emergency response to tightening agricultural credit in the early and mid-1980s, in the middle of a number of notable bank failures.Collier on Bankruptcy., 8-1200 P 2. The Act was to originally expire on October 1, 1993, but it was extended a number of times without expiring until it was made permanent by the 2005 BAPCPA. Description Chapter 12 provides additional benefits not available under chapter 13 and chapter 11. These benefits include higher debt ceilings than those under chapter 13, and more advantageous exemptions.

In heraldry and vexillology, fimbriation is the placement of small stripes of contrasting colour around common charges or ordinaries, usually in order for them to stand out from the background, or perhaps just because the designer felt it looked better, or for a more technical reason (in heraldry only) to avoid what would otherwise be a violation of the rule of tincture.The arms of Daniel Christopher Boyer (\\"Sable, three fleurs-de-lys one and two Azure, fimbriated Argent, in base a chevron per chevron Vert and Gules, all fimbriated Argent\\") are an example of this reason. While fimbriation almost invariably applies to both or all sides of a charge, there are very unusual examples of fimbriation on one side only. Another rather rare form is double fimbriation (blazoned \\"double fimbriated\\"), where the charge or ordinary is accompanied by two stripes of colour instead of only one. In cases of double fimbriation the outer colour is blazoned first. The municipal flag of Mozirje, in Slovenia, show an example of fimbriation that itself is fimbriated. Fimbriation may also be used when a charge is the same colour as the field on which it is placed. A red charge placed on a red background may be necessary, for instance where the charge and field are both a specific colour for symbolic or historical reasons, and in these cases fimbriation becomes a necessity in order for the charge to be visible. In some cases, such as a fimbriated cross placed on a field of the same colour as the cross, the effect is identical to the use of cross voided, i.e. a cross shown in outline only. According to the rule of tincture, one of the fundamental rules of heraldic design, colour may not be placed on colour nor metal on metal. (In heraldry, \\"metal\\" refers to gold and silver, frequently represented using yellow and white respectively. \\"Colour\\" refers to all other colours.) Sometimes, however, it is desired to do something like this, so fimbriation is used to comply with the rule. Flag of South Africa, showing yellow and white fimbriation In vexillology that is not specifically heraldic, the rules of heraldry do not apply, yet fimbriation is still frequently seen. The reason for this is largely the same as the reason for the heraldic rule of tincture: that is, the need for visibility — the separation of darker colours by white or yellow is an aid to the visual separation of the darker colours. A good example of a flag which uses fimbriation is the national flag of South Africa which is fimbriated in white above and below the central green area, and in yellow between it and the triangle at the hoist. Though fimbriation is, heraldically, intended to be used to separate areas that are both colours (by the use of a metal) or both metals (by the use of a colour), occasionally flags may be found which use fimbriation in non-standard ways. One example of this is the flag of the Faroe Islands, which separates a red cross from a white field with blue fimbriation. Another example of this non-standard fimbriation is the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, which separates areas of blue and red with black fimbriation. The flag of Uzbekistan also uses this form of \\"pseudo- fimbriation\\" - it adds a thin red band between a colour and a metal, separating blue (above) and green (below) from a central white stripe. Some 15 to 20 countries use fimbriation on their national flags. National flags that use fimbriation include those of Trinidad and Tobago, North Korea, Botswana, Kenya and - most famously - the British Union Flag. On this last flag the fimbriation is unusual, as a white fimbriation separates a blue field from a red cross (representing England) but also from a divided red and white saltire (the red representing Ireland and the white representing Scotland). The white fimbriation along the white part of the saltire - possibly unique in vexillology - is responsible for the famous \\"lopsidedness\\" of the Union Jack, giving it the appearance of having a red saltire fimbriated more widely on one side than the other.

Created by writer Allan Heinberg and artist Jim Cheung, the character first appeared in Young Avengers #1 (April 2005). The character's appearance is patterned on that of two prominent Marvel superheroes, Thor and Scarlet Witch, both of whom are members of the Avengers. Like the Scarlet Witch, Wiccan possesses powerful magical abilities which make him a key member of his superhero team. Recruited to the Young Avengers by Iron Lad, Wiccan's story includes the discovery that he and fellow teen hero Speed are in fact long-lost twin brothers, and that the pair are the sons of Scarlet Witch and her husband Vision. Significant storylines for the character include him and his brother's search for their missing mother, learning to master his powers, and an ongoing relationship with his teammate Hulkling. Alongside his permanent role as a member of the Young Avengers, Wiccan has also been a member of Avengers Idea Mechanics and Strikeforce. Publication history Wiccan first appeared in Young Avengers #1 (April 2005). The issue was scripted by Allan Heinberg and drawn by Jim Cheung. One of the original four members of the Young Avengers, the team was founded after the Avengers disbanded in the story line Avengers Disassembled. Initially, Heinberg assumed that Marvel would not allow him to write two leading homosexual characters. Because of this, he originally planned to write Billy's love interest, Hulkling, as a female shapeshifter named Chimera. Chimera would discover that her true form was male, which would force Billy to decide if he was still in love with him. However, due to the complexity of this proposed story line, editor Tom Brevoort suggested simply making both characters gay. Wiccan appeared in the new 2013 Young Avengers series by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie. As part of the All-New All-Different Marvel rebranding, Wiccan (along with Hulkling) appears as a member of the New Avengers led by Sunspot along with Songbird, Squirrel Girl, Hawkeye, Power Man and White Tiger. He later guest-starred in the Scarlet Witch series written by James Robinson. In 2019, he will star in Strikeforce alongside Blade, Angela, Spider-Woman, Monica Rambeau, Daimon Hellstrom and Winter Soldier.https://www.newsarama.com/45536-strikeforce-promises-to-do-marvel-s- dirtiest-jobs.html Fictional character biography Billy Kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to Jeff Kaplan, a cardiologist, and Rebecca Kaplan, a psychologist. Regularly bullied in school because of his homosexuality, Billy found solace outside the gates of the Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy encountered the Avenger the Scarlet Witch, who told him to stand his ground the next time it happens. She then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly. The flash healed Billy's wounds, and a few weeks later, he stood up for another kid being bullied, demonstrating his mutant powers for the first time, and nearly killing his tormentor. =Young Avengers= He was one of the Young Avengers chosen as a result of the Iron Lad's plan for the reformation of the Avengers, in the event the team ever disbanded. He originally chose the code name Asgardian, but later changed it to Wiccan. The full extent of his powers is unknown, though they include flight and lightning generation. He can cast spells using a technique learned from \\"self-help books\\" owned by fellow Young Avenger Hulkling's mother. By chanting a mantra/statement of intent (for example, \\"I want Iron Lad to forget\\") and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve, he can manipulate reality, causing certain events and effects to happen. =Family Matters= Billy has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers. Billy's possible relationship to Wanda was revealed by the Super-Skrull and Vision.Young Avengers #11. Marvel Comics. In the past, the Scarlet Witch used her reality warping powers to create twin sons, unknowingly, from two (of five) scattered fragments of the soul of the demon Mephisto that were previously lost to him in an ill-fated encounter with the powerful mutant child, Franklin Richards.. When the boys' souls were reabsorbed into Mephisto, because of the power Wanda put into the soul fragments, they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as Thomas Shepherd, the Young Avenger Speed, and Billy. =Civil War= During the Civil War, Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda. S.H.I.E.L.D. arrests the Young Avengers. However, Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations. When the Runaways try to stay out of the conflict, they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development in the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America vetoes the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli Bradley (Patriot) succeeds in convincing Nico Minoru to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by Noh-Varr, who captures Wiccan, Karolina, and Hulkling, and (apparently) kills the Runaway Xavin. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him.Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways. Marvel Comics. Wiccan is among the Secret Avengers who takes part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two casualties. Tony Stark and Peter Parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be incapacitated to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and Cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriates Steve Rogers (Captain America). A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, Goliath lies dead, slain by Ragnarok, the cyborg clone of Thor. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side.Civil War #3. Marvel Comics. Billy and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic Hank Pym's retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells.Civil War #6. Marvel Comics. Billy is shown to be a member of the Initiative, along with Hulkling. However, it is later revealed that some, perhaps most, of the Young Avengers did not actually join The Initiative or even register. They were registered by their Earth-A counterparts; both Wiccan and Hulking are seen complaining about being registered to their \\"A Selves\\".She-Hulk vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.SHE-HULK #21 - Marvel Comics Publishing Catalog It's been subsequently shown that since registration, Billy has spent most of his time at home, apparently grounded, with his parents wanting him to register.Young Avengers Presents #1. Marvel Comics. =The Search for the Scarlet Witch= Wiccan and Speed later search for the Scarlet Witch following the events of Civil War. While Billy and Tommy both search for Wanda (referring to her as \\"Mom\\") they encounter Master Pandemonium, who recognizes Wiccan's magic as that of the Scarlet Witch and further explains their original history as the Scarlet Witch's children. However, he likens the boys' search for their past and Wanda to his own former life as rising actor, and tells them that their past was \\"darkness and chaos\\" and advises them that they should embrace who they are now. This appears to have satisfied Wiccan, who calls off his search for now, deciding that he is happy with the person he is and the people in his life.Young Avengers Presents #3 (March 2008).

The team is turned to stone by Chthon's magic, except for Vision and Stature, who arrive too late.. Doctor Strange, the former Sorcerer Supreme and one of Marvel's premiere magic users, visits Wiccan to discuss his potential candidacy and ability to assume the position as the new Sorcerer Supreme. When the Hood finds Strange and engages him in magical combat, Wiccan aids him, contrary to Strange's orders to flee. Wiccan and Strange teleport to the New Avengers seeking help.New Avengers #51.

Marvel Comics. Wiccan, a lover of Asgardian mythology, fought in the battle, and alongside Hulkling defeated the Wrecking Crew, who were looting the Throne Room after the fall of Asgard. He displayed a fearsome level of power producing lightning bolts to conquer the villains, much to Hulkling's worry.Siege: Young Avengers One Shot. Marvel Comics. =The Children's Crusade= During a fight between a group of nuclear-armed Sons of the Serpent and the Young Avengers, Wiccan loses control of his powers and renders the entire group of terrorists comatose. The Avengers arrive and take Wiccan to their base stating that they want to examine his full capabilities, concerned that, like the Scarlet Witch, if he were to lose control of his powers, he could cause massive devastation. In the process, the Avengers reveal to the team that the Scarlet Witch, having gone insane after losing her twin sons, killed several of her teammates, changed all of reality into House of M, and then was responsible for the depowering and deaths of millions of mutants. Wiccan reiterates his belief that he and Speed are truly the transposed souls of the Scarlet Witch's children and that she may not have been purposefully behind those events. Seeing the Avengers' and his friends' distrust of the Scarlet Witch and their discomfort with him due to uncertainty of his powers, he storms out, only to find that Captain America has informed his parents of what occurred during the early battle. Wiccan, accompanied by Hulkling, goes with Captain America and is situated for observation. However, the other Young Avengers decide to break them out, urging Wiccan to search for the Scarlet Witch. By showing her that the children she lost may be alive and well, the Young Avengers believe that she may be cured of her madness and be able to reverse the damage she had done. In particular, Stature hopes that locating and curing the Scarlet Witch could mean a chance at reviving her father. Immediately, Magneto arrives, stating that he wants Wiccan and Speed to finally know him as their grandfather. However the Avengers intercede in the conversation and go into battle with Magneto and the Young Avengers. Wiccan is attacked by Wolverine and is then convinced by Ms. Marvel that this is a battle they cannot win. Wiccan then teleports his team and Magneto to Wundagore Mountain in Transia, The Scarlet Witch's birthplace, leaving the Avengers behind, who decide to let Wiccan find the Scarlet Witch so they can take care of both of them at once. Upon arriving, Patriot lashes out in anger at Wiccan, but Hawkeye intercedes and decides that they will look for the Scarlet Witch together. Patriot then confides with Hawkeye that he believes the Avengers are right and that they need to go back. However Hawkeye tells Patriot that he needs to pick a side and walks away angry. The Vision confides his fear that Stature may sacrifice herself to bring back her father, and that that is something that neither he nor her father would want. Finally, the group reaches the Grave of Magda, Wanda's mother, and Magneto tells the children about the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver's birth. Wiccan then reaches out with his magic and finds the Scarlet Witch in the town, and Speed goes to investigate, only to run into Quicksilver. Quicksilver then threatens Magneto and kidnaps Wiccan. Speed however catches up with Quicksilver and the two race, with Wiccan being carried by Quicksilver the whole time. Eventually, Quicksilver decides that the only way to stop his father and get Wiccan to help him find his sister is to kill Magneto. He fashions out stakes using fence posts and runs back to the village, throwing wooden stakes at Magneto, who dodges them. In the process, Quicksilver seemingly impales Wanda, who is discovered to be a Doombot, and that Doctor Doom has the real Scarlet Witch.Avengers: The Children's Crusade #2. Marvel Comics. That night, everyone, Magneto and Quicksilver included, debates over invading Latveria to retrieve the Scarlet Witch, and they decide to sleep on it until the morning. Wiccan secretly leaves the group and is in the middle of a spell to teleport himself to Latveria. Quicksilver interrupts him, pointing out their similarities and again trying to get Wiccan to help him. However, Hulking arrives with the rest of the Young Avengers, threatening Quicksilver and reprimanding Wiccan. Meanwhile, the Avengers meet with Wonder Man, hoping to use him to find Wanda and Wiccan. Simon, however, refuses and decides to go and find Wanda himself and help bring her back. Late that night in Transia, Wiccan writes a note for Hulkling expressing his love and apologizing for leaving for Latveria alone. Wiccan then teleports to Doom's castle and disguises himself as the Scarlet Witch to gain access. He is escorted by Doombots to a room where he is then assaulted by an amnesiac Scarlet Witch. Wiccan tells Wanda that he plans to rescue, omitting that he is her son. However, Wanda states that there is no need for that as she is about to be married. Doctor Doom then arrives to tell Wiccan that it is he whom Wanda will marry, and then attacks Wiccan.Avengers: The Children's Crusade #3. Marvel Comics. Wiccan tries to tell Wanda about her past life as the Scarlet Witch, but Doctor Doom knocks him unconscious during the battle before Wiccan can finish. Later, Doom tells Wiccan that Wanda came to him, and although he does not understand how, he has truly fallen in love with Wanda. Later, Wanda comes to see Wiccan asking him to tell her everything about the Scarlet Witch before she marries Doom. In the meantime, Magneto and the Young Avengers plan to invade Doom's castle in order to get Wiccan back, but are stopped by Wonder Man, and the Avengers who followed him secretly. A battle ensues, and Wolverine goes to find Wanda and Wiccan to kill them, but is stopped by Iron Lad, who states that the future depends on Wiccan's survival.Avengers: The Children's Crusade #4. Marvel Comics. Eventually Wanda recovers her memory and powers. Billy asks her to use her magic to determine whether or not they are truly mother and son. It becomes clear that they are, and Wanda begs Billy's forgiveness. Mother and child embrace lovingly and weep for joy. Wanda is now determined to undo the harm she did, and restore the mutants. The first beneficiary is Rictor.Avengers: The Children's Crusade #6. Marvel Comics. However, the X-Men intervene, and as the Avengers arrive, the two teams fight. Wanda teleports herself and the Young Avengers back to Latveria. Wiccan decides to help Doctor Doom and Wanda cast a spell to give the mutants back their powers. However, Patriot refuses to trust Doctor Doom, and shoots an explosive arrow at him to stop the spell, which results in Doctor Doom attaining Wanda's reality altering powers. The new Doctor Doom teleports the team after Wanda begs him to relinquish the power. Doctor Doom appears in front of the X-Men, the Avengers, X-Factor, the Young Avengers, and Wanda, and a battle ensues ending in Cassie's death. Wanda and Wiccan manage to drain the power from Doctor Doom, and he leaves. Iron Lad wants to take back Cassie's body into the timestream to find someone who could bring her back, but the Vision stops him and is subsequently destroyed. Wanda leaves to find herself, the X-Men go back to Utopia, and the Young Avengers decide to disband. Wiccan blames himself for everything that has happened, and ends up falling into a depression, but with Hulkling proposing to him the two get back into costume with Hawkeye and Speed (Patriot moved to Arizona) and Captain America makes the team full-fledged Avengers. In a one-shot issue of Children's Crusade: Young Avengers, a flash to the future shows Billy wearing the uniform of Dr. Strange, implying he has attained the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme at some point in the future.. =Battle against Mother= Some time later, it is revealed that the group went their separate ways due to their several losses. Billy and Teddy are living together with Billy's parents. Billy discovers though that Teddy has broken their promise to give up being superheroes by fighting crime at night. After getting into an argument, Billy tries to make it up to Teddy by shuffling through different realities to find one identical to theirs at the moment before Teddy's mother died. Billy finds this moment and brings Teddy's mother back to life. However, the Mother soon displays strange abilities and attempts to kill Billy and Teddy, with somehow Billy's parents not noticing. After escaping her, they run into Loki, who due to recent events, is a child again. He tells them that the Mother is not actually Teddy's mom, but a parasite from the multiverse who takes the guise of whatever travelers are looking for. Due to its strange abilities, adults are oblivious to whatever happens around the Mother, and any parents around them become part of her personal army (save for Scarlet Witch, who is able to resist, but still remains oblivious to what is going on, as with the rest of the Avengers). The three soon reunite with Kate, who has been having one night stands with Noh-Varr, while joined by America Chavez, a god from another universe with super-strength and the ability to kick holes in reality. Discovering that any parents around the group fall prey to Mother's spell, the group uses Noh-Varr's ship to leave Earth, while Loki will train Billy in magic to hopefully reverse what he has done. On their travels, Loki talks to Teddy about Billy's powers, saying that it's highly unlikely that some attractive alien prince would just happen to find Billy, happen to be gay, and happen to fall in love with him. Teddy begins to wonder if he was indeed created by Billy to fill a hole in his life. Soon they are summoned back to Earth by former X-Men member David Alleyne, who has been working a temp job with Tommy. According to him, a mysterious figure wearing Patriot's old outfit kidnapped Tommy, and he requires their help to find him. Apparently, Tommy was brought to another reality, and America uses her powers to let them travel between worlds. The group hop from universe to universe for a while, eventually finding a universe of adorable creatures worshipping Billy as a god named 'the demiurge'. Loki and America have been trying to hide this from Billy for a while, but they reveal that one day he shall become an entity known as the demiurge, and during his time as this being, will change the laws of magic in every universe and every time period, past, present, and future. However, the group is soon ambushed by Mother while in between universes, and they become separated. When reuniting, Teddy tells Billy and what he and Loki discussed, and the two break up while on Earth. Teddy takes a break from the group, soon finding a support group for those wronged by the Young Avengers, apparently led by Mother. Mother kidnaps Teddy, and the Young Avengers prepare to save him. Loki develops a plan to have Billy access a fraction of the demiurge's power, which should be enough to kill Mother. Thinking they will be outnumbered by the armies Mother has been amassing made up of other-universe versions of the group and the parents she has brainwashed, David calls every super-powered hero under the age of 23 to help them fight, while all the world's older heroes and villains remain unaware that any of this is happening. Loki, however, tells Billy that Loki can only help if he is at full power, and Billy uses a spell to restore Loki to a young adult. Loki and Billy prepare to give Billy near-unlimited power while the battle in central park begins between Mother's army and the world's teenage and young adult heroes. Kate, America, Noh-Varr, and David save Teddy, Teddy finding Billy on the battlefield, who is unable to access his power. Teddy tells him it is okay, and the two kiss, this being the spark Billy needed to access the demiurge. Billy uses his moment of power to successfully kill Mother, getting rid of her spell and any trace of her through the multiverse. Billy reunites with his parents, introducing them to the group, though Loki has vanished. Later, a party is being held at a club by a mysterious benefactor, which the group and all the heroes who fought in the battle attend. Here, Billy and Teddy are shown to be once again in a happy relationship. The Young Avengers soon get ready to leave, save for Loki, who was watching from a distance, and was the benefactor for the party. The group leaves, as Loki reminisces while looking at a selfie they all took during their journeys together.Young Avengers Vol. 2 #1–15. Marvel Comics. =New Avengers= Loki and America's prophecy comes true soon after Billy and Teddy are recruited by Sunspot to become members of the New Avengers, a team working alongside A.I.M.. A group of Kree-Skull hybrids arrive on Earth, intending for Teddy to finally ascend to his position as the Emperor who will unite the two warring races. Unable to stop their teleportation ray, Billy goes with him to their planet whilst the rest of the team attempt a rescue. Upon reaching the planet, they discover that one of the hybrids has been taken over by a ghost wizard named Moridun. He is killed by Teddy who resolves to return and take his place as Emperor when he is ready. Unbeknownst to the New Avengers, Moridun was not destroyed and has actually taken over Billy, who changes his codename to Demiurge. Under the control of Moridun, Billy begins acting weird, suggesting that they should kill some of the thieves they are fighting. It is only when a group of future avengers travel back in time to warn them does Teddy realise what has happened. Despite the future avengers preparing to kill Billy, Teddy encourages him to fight and he successfully drives Moridun out of his body, averting the huge amount of death that was to be caused. Later, Sunspot goes rogue, separating A.I.M. from the New Avengers and abandoning the team. During the second superhero civil war, Wiccan joins forces with several other sorcerers lead by Doctor Strange to destroy a Celestial. Although initially doubtful of his right to fight alongside such powerful magic users, his confidence is restored by Scarlet Witch. He is contacted by Sunspot, who convinces Billy, Teddy and Squirrel Girl to reform the New Avengers and work alongside A.I.M for one final mission. Wiccan teleports the trio onto a SHIELD helicarrier to aid in the rescue of Songbird before regrouping with Sunspot and facing off against the Maker and his Revengers. After this, the New Avengers permanently disband and, as a thank you, Sunspot gifts Wiccan and Hulkling an apartment overlooking Central Park, allowing the couple to focus on their personal lives for the time being.New Avengers vol. 4 #18. Marvel Comics. =War of the Realms= When Dark Elves invade Manhattan, Billy is summoned by Loki, who is initially disguised as Kate Bishop, to a drag bar where he attempts to convince him to side with Malekith in the war. Loki tries to gain Billy's forgiveness for attempting to manipulate him and steal the power of the demiurge when they both served as Young Avengers but he refuses, telling him it is not his place as he was not the only one wronged.

He is taken into custody with the others and is greeted by Blade, who explains that the group were taken over by mysterious shapeshifters and framed for their actions. Angela quickly identifies these shapeshifters as Asgardian and the team track them to their base. Wiccan is reluctant to join the mission, believing that they are doing the wrong thing by keeping the Avengers in the dark about their mission but he is convinced that it is best if only a small group of people know about the shapeshifters as their power comes from people having knowledge of them. The group is attacked by Daimon Hellstrom and, assuming he is a shapeshifter in disguise, Blade kills him before receiving a phone call from Satana who explains that her brother is with her in Las Vegas and is acting strangely. The team go to Satana's club and Wiccan is tasked with destroying the shapeshifter but stresses that his powers don't allow him to resurrect Hellstrom.

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities As Wiccan, Billy Kaplan possesses an innate mystical ability which allows him to alter and manipulate reality at will. While patterning himself after Thor in the guise of Asgardian, Billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning-based spells. By stating an intent and focusing on the outcome, Wiccan is capable of a variety of feats, including, but not limited to tracking and locating others, illusionary disguises, tearing down force- fields, mass teleportation, concussive blasts, enchantments, astral projection, and telekinetic force beams. Billy must be able to hear his spells for them to be successful, but some of Billy's spells can be activated without words. He has consistently been able to create force fields, teleport others, and generate lightning and force blasts with little or no effort. Wiccan was one of the many possible candidates for the title of Sorcerer Supreme, and has been described by the Vision as \\"one of the most powerful mages on the planet.\\" Doctor Strange has partnered with a time-traveling Wiccan from the future and was confirmed that he succeeds Strange being the Sorcerer Supreme. Loki predicted that Wiccan will evolve into a god by his own right one day. In Young Avengers vol. 2, it is revealed by Loki that Wiccan is destined to ascend to a god-like reality warper who will rewrite the rules of magic known as the Demiurge.. Loki (to Wiccan): \\"You're a singular multidimensional messiah. You're going to rewrite the rules of magic and all the implications of that decision are going to echo forward and backward across all realities.\\" He briefly achieves this form, and is able to view the past, present and future, as well as freely alter the universe. However, deciding that he is not ready to wield this power, he relinquishes it and reverts to his human form.. Wiccan: \\"I have all this power... and so the responsibility to use it. But I've also the responsibility to know how to use the power. And Billy Kaplan, you don't know what the hell you're doing. / Wiccan (to Loki): \\"I could have saved everything.\\" / Loki (to Wiccan): \\"Or broken it.\\" In Doctor Strange and the Sorcerers Supreme, Stephen Strange travels to a dimension in which past and future Sorcerer Supremes are all gathered. Billy is revealed to become the Sorcerer Supreme in the future after Stephen.Doctor Strange and the Sorcerers Supreme Vol 1 #01 Parentage Heinberg stated on the situation in a transcript with fans, \\"According to Billy's theory, the souls of Wanda's twins inhabited his and Tommy's bodies when they were dispersed from Mephisto. But it's only a theory.\\"Avengers Forever - Chat Room Transcript He also stated in another interview that his plans for the new 'season' involved the two searching for Wanda, stating \\"If everything goes according to plan, Wanda will indeed return to Young Avengers early in Season Two, when Billy and Tommy embark on a search for the true source of their powers.\\"Prism Comics » Features » Ten Queeries with Allan Heinberg Indeed, the Young Avengers Present issue from March 2008 involves the \\"twin brothers\\" Wiccan and Speed looking for their \\"mother Wanda\\".NEWSARAMA.COM: MARVEL COMICS SOLICITATIONS FOR MARCH 2008 The Super-Skrull and the Vision's files consider Kaplan and Shepherd to be siblings. While Kaplan believes himself and Shepherd may be Wanda Maximoff's reincarnated children, Shepherd is more skeptical about the situation. During their search for the Scarlet Witch, Wiccan is even more certain that he and Tommy are siblings. Both boys refer to one another as \\"brothers\\" and Speed claims to be the older of the two (though neither knows for certain) and also refer to the Scarlet Witch as \\"Mom\\" while searching for her. In Children's Crusade #6, Scarlet Witch confirms that Billy and Tommy are the genetic reincarnations of her sons. When Wanda is discussing her life with a psychiatrist, she again confirms that Billy and Tommy are the reincarnated souls of her sons. However, seeing as they are already teenagers, Wanda doesn't know if they were normal kids before her sons' souls took over their bodies (effectively killing whoever they were before) or whether the spirits went back in time to be born and raised by different parents.Scarlet Witch vol. 2 #8 Relationships Exchanges between Wiccan and Hulkling had led to speculation that the two teens had a much more intimate bond than mere friendship.Alan Kistler (20 November 2013). \\"10 Great LGBT Superheroes (And Superhero Couples)\\". Newsarama. \\"In the original Young Avengers series, writer/creator Allan Heinberg intended to reveal that teammates Billy and Teddy were a couple in issue #12. But to his surprise, many fans picked up on the clues of the first two issues and quickly concluded the truth.\\" Retrieved January 7, 2014. Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship,Young Avengers #12 and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly. Kate advises that Asgardian should change his codename to avoid puns regarding his sexuality when the press discovers that he's in a relationship with Hulkling, implying that the others already knew the two are gay. Kate, along with Stature, suggested the codename, \\"Wiccan,\\" which Billy adopts. When the team agrees to give an interview to Kat Farrell, Jessica Jones warns Billy and Teddy that Farrell will probably ask if the rumors about them are true. After some deliberation, the two decide to tell Farrell, with Teddy adding, \\"Why should Northstar have all the fun?\\". In Young Avengers Presents #3, Hulkling and Wiccan's romantic relationship is handled much more openly than previous issues. In it, they refer to one another as boyfriends. Speed also asks if their relationship is \\"getting hot and heavy\\" and jokes that Billy and Teddy would have a disastrous \\"mixed marriage\\" due to Teddy's alien heritage.Young Avengers Presents #3 In the aftermath of The Children's Crusade, Billy falls into a months long depression, watching from the sidelines as New York is turned into \\"Spider Island\\" and the Human Torch is resurrected. Teddy is able to bring Billy back \\"out of the dark\\" by proposing to him. In Young Avengers Vol. 2, Billy and Teddy's relationship is tested due to the meddling of Loki, who plants the idea in Teddy's head that he is not real and was unknowingly created by Billy using his reality warping powers. Teddy is kissed by Prodigy. The couple reconcile at the conclusion of the storyline and are last seen happily dancing together at Marvel Boy's party. In New Avengers, the hybrids refer to Teddy as Emperor Dorrek VIII and Billy as his \\"prince consort\\". A flashforward to possible future 20XX shows an older Billy and Teddy living happily together with a daughter, Katie. Hulkling became a key player in Empyre, Marvel's summer 2020 crossover event. A one-shot, Lords of Empyre: Emperor Hulkling, written by Chip Zdarsky and queer author Anthony Oliveira, fills in some of the backstory of how Hulkling was called on to become emperor and his relationship with Wiccan. As well as setting Hulkling up for the Empyre event, Emperor Hulkling also shows the importance of their relationship to each other. It was important to co-author Oliveira that the one-shot depict the everyday \\"queer life\\" that Hulkling lives and to expand on his character, who is often \\"left on the bench\\" while \\"Wiccan is off saving the world\\". Oliveira had previously shown the couple having a queer everyday life with Wiccan going to a drag brunch with Loki, with Hulkling largely lounging on the sofa at home, eating cereal from a bowl balanced on Excelsior, his Star Sword. While Wiccan is off on Strikeforce duties, the events of Emperor Hulkling start at a drag bar, where Hulkling is drinking with fellow Young Avengers Prodigy and Speed, who are also depicted as a gay couple. After Hulkling battles purist Skrull extremists in the drag bar, he and Wiccan spend time together before boarding the Imperial Fleet, where Wiccan enchants Hulkling's engagement ring, so he can teleport to Hulkling's location. Later in Emperor Hulkling, Hulkling is forced to denounce Wiccan before privately reassuring Wiccan that he did not mean it and \\"had [his] fingers crossed\\". Origin of name Asked about Billy's codename, Heinberg said \\"It turns out that code names are the trickiest part of creating new characters. When Kate suggests 'Wiccan' to Billy in Young Avengers #6, she, like me, was not thinking in terms of the specific religious practice of Wicca, but rather attempting to find a suitable counterpart for the word 'witch.' It was certainly not my intention to offend anyone with 'Wiccan.' And since adopting the code name, rest assured Billy has been doing his Wiccan homework, so keep reading...\\" During their time fighting the Mother, Loki eventually questions Wiccan about his codename. He complains that since he is a pagan deity, he takes some offence to its use, and jokingly states that he has a list of better names.Remy Minnick (January 4, 2006). \\"Allan Heinberg Brings War To The Young Avengers\\". Comixfan Forums. Retrieved January 7, 2014. In the pages of New Avengers, Power Man questions Billy over his choice of codename. Although he explains that he has been researching the religion of Wicca, he admits that it is not his faith. Victor then suggests that he should change it (with Teddy begging him not to revert to Asgardian). Billy later changes his name to Demiurge whilst under the control of the ghost wizard Moridun. Reception Wiccan has received generally positive reception, with particular focus on his relationship with Hulkling. Heinberg reported that when the relationship was initially suspected before its confirmation, most fan were supportive, with minimal negative reaction. Heinberg: \\"Mostly people have been openly supportive. There were two negative letters—but I have been heartened and happily astonished by the reaction.\\" Wiccan and Hulkling have been called \\"Marvel's most prominent gay couple,\\" and received praise for showing diversity and progression in comics. Writer Andrew Wheeler ranked the couple as #6 on a list of fifty comics and characters that LGBT readers have connected to. He wrote: \\"Something about the sweetness of the love between Hulkling and Wiccan, aka Billy and Teddy, has struck a strong chord with readers looking for a little romance to melt their hearts. After dealing with time travellers, alien invasions and mad mutants, their story stands out as an It Gets Better for the superhero set.\\" While accepting the Corporate Vanguard Award for Marvel Entertainment at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, Marvel's VP of Animation Development, Cort Lane, cited Wiccan and Hulkling's relationship as one of his favorite story lines featuring LGBT characters.

Eventually the Reaper joined forces with Kang and Ultron-59 and their \\"final battle\\" with the Avengers. Billy appeared to be friends with this future's Oddball and the two discussed Billy's desire for revenge against his brother and father. Billy and his brother were locked in battle until their father, the Vision, destroyed Ultron, ending the fight. As the Vision lay dying, he implored Billy not to give up on humanity the way he had when Wanda was killed. What exactly became of Billy following the Avengers' victory is unknown. Unlike Earth-616, Tommy inherited their mother's mystical abilities and the nature of Billy's powers were unspecified. As the Grim Reaper, Billy wielded a scythe of unknown nature, either technological or mystic, that could teleport back to him if it left his hand. The scythe could presumably cut what he wanted it to while harmlessly phasing through what he did not, such as when he impaled Jessie Wingfoot without injuring Ultron-59. During the battle with Tommy, his scythe was able to deflect mystical force bolts conjured at him.The Last Avengers Story #1, 2 =Battle of the Atom= During Battle of the Atom, Billy is seen as a member of the future X-Men who travel back in time to stop a group of impostors led by Beast.

The species is one of the largest terrestrial true bugs in North America, reaching up to in length in their adult stage. They are sexually dimorphic, in that males are somewhat smaller than the females. A characteristic structure is the wheel-shaped pronotal armor. Wheel bugs prey on caterpillars and beetles, such as Japanese beetles, the cabbage worm, orange dogs, tent caterpillars, and the Mexican bean beetle, all of which they pierce with their beak to inject salivary fluids that dissolve soft tissue. Wheel bugs are most active in daylight, though they may engage in predatory behaviors at night in areas illuminated by lights. Because most of their prey are pests, wheel bugs are considered beneficial. They are camouflaged and very shy, residing in leafy areas and hiding whenever possible.Wheel Bug - Scientific Name, Classification, Taxonomy, North American Reach and Size Specifically, habitats of the wheel bug include sunflowers, goldenrod, cotton, trunks of locust trees, and various fruit and tree groves. They have membranous wings, allowing for clumsy, noisy flight which can easily be mistaken for the flight of a large grasshopper. The adult is gray to brownish gray in color and black shortly after molting, but the nymphs (which do not yet have the wheel-shaped structure) have bright red or orange abdomens. It was described in 1763 by Carl Linnaeus. Despite the prevalence of the wheel bug in many habitats, the information compiled concerning the species is haphazard and incomplete. Description The wheel bug has a characteristic dorsal crest, shaped like a wheel or cog. It moves and flies slowly, and in flight produces a noisy buzzing sound. As with other assassin bugs, its proboscis arises from the anterior end of its long, tubular head and unfolds forward when feeding. It possesses two scent glands (red-orange in color) that can be ejected from its abdomen, usually in reaction to being disturbed. The scent produced by it is not as powerful as that produced by stink bugs, but is still strong enough to be detected by humans. Wheel bugs exhibit armored forewings and membranous hind wings which allow the wheel bug to take flight. As a result of its inability to move swiftly, wheel bugs rely heavily upon camouflage, the effect of their bite, or the production of unpleasant odors in order to avoid predation. Distribution Wheel bugs are most common in eastern Canada and the United States, and their range extends into Mexico and Guatemala. Among the four species of Arilus, a western hemisphere genus, only A. cristatus is found in the United States. Behavior Wheel bugs initiate predation by gripping and pinning their prey with their front legs. The bug plunges its beak into its victim before injecting it with enzymes, paralyzing it and dissolving its insides, and proceeds to drain the resulting fluids. The wheel bug is also noted to be very aggressive in the wild, and cannibalistic behaviors between them have been noted; for example, nymphs may prey on one another and the female may feed on the male after mating is concluded. Additionally, like many reduviids, the species is capable of producing audible sound by rubbing the tip of its proboscis in a groove under its thorax. The purpose of this sound is unknown and may serve as a means of communication between members of the species. Reproduction The reproductive cycle of the wheel bug initiates in autumn. After mating, the female will lay 40-200 small, brown, cylindrical eggs, and eventually die. Females lay eggs on trees, bushes, twigs, and other objects. Secreted glue serves as an adhesive which maintains the cluster formation of the eggs. The eggs will hatch in the following spring into eight millimeter long red nymphs, which will undergo 5 molts until they reach the adult stage the following summer. After the nymphs hatch, the average length of each molt is roughly 18.8 days, though the interval of the 5th and final molt prior to the adult stage is the longest. Eggs generally hatch in the beginning of May and finally mature into adults by July. Overall, it takes roughly 94 days for nymphs to reach maturity. However, the phenology of this life cycle varies based upon the climate which the population occupies. For instance, communities in warm climates may not overwinter as eggs. In a laboratory test conducted at Southern Illinois University in 1997 and 1998, research revealed that the species’ eggs may be attacked by parasitic wasps, such as Ooencyrtus johnsoni. Of the 12 clusters of eggs monitored in the lab, 10 were ravaged by parasites which prevented the eggs from hatching normally. Wheel bugs are predatory immediately upon hatching, but the distinctive wheel unique to the species derives only after the bug reaches the adult stage following the final molt. Ecological significance Wheel bugs are highly regarded by organic gardeners because they consume a variety of insects and their presence indicates a healthy, pesticide-free ecosystem. \\"They're the lion or the eagle of your food web,\\" Dr. Michael J. Raupp, an entomologist at the University of Maryland, notes. \\"They sit on top. When you have these big, ferocious predators in your landscape, that tells me that this is a very healthy landscape, because all these other levels in your food web are intact.\\"Wanted Dead or Alive (No, Just Dead), Anne Raver, New York Times, November 27, 2013 Though wheel bugs are a welcome agent of pest control, they also prey on several ecologically beneficial species, such as lady beetles and honey bees. Interactions with humans The species is generally indifferent concerning the presence and interruption of humans. Although evidence suggests that wheel bugs can seemingly be domesticated in controlled environments, if provoked or mishandled, they may attack in an act of defense. As a cautionary warning, the bite of a wheel bug is generally considered to be of greater severity in terms of the level and duration of pain than the sting of common insects such as wasps. The resulting wound is documented to be extremely painful, lasting, and lingering, accompanied by an unceasing numbness which can persist for days. These effects can be avoided by handling the docile insect with gloves. The bite is not considered highly venomous, so is not serious in the short term. Furthermore, the vicinity of the injury is known to become heated and irritated. A white crust sometimes forms around the wound during the healing process, though it eventually deteriorates, leaving the small puncture wound visible. Discomfort may persist for 2 weeks and up to 6 months in some cases. However the latter timeline is frequently attributed to allergic reactions or recurrent infections of the original wound.

The 1999 election and aftermath  In the parliamentary election of 1999, Cokanauto, a candidate of the Fijian Association Party (FAP), won the Tailevu North Ovalau Open constituency on a recount, having failed to win on the initial count by a mere two votes. Although the FAP was part of the victorious People's Coalition, Cokanauto was not included in the new Cabinet announced by Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry. Following disagreements over the party's nominations to the Senate and the style of leadership, Cokanauto challenged Deputy Prime Minister and Fijian Affairs Minister Adi Kuini Speed for the leadership of the party on 11 September 1999. He initially ousted her, but the High Court subsequently ruled in Speed's favour. A vote to resolve the impasse narrowly confirmed Speed as leader, and Cokanauto and his supporters moved to the Opposition benches in January 2000, forming a breakaway faction of the FAP.

It was contested by the Eastern Conference champion Buffalo Sabres and the Western Conference champion Dallas Stars. It was the 106th year of the Stanley Cup being contested. The Sabres were led by captain Michael Peca, head coach Lindy Ruff and goaltender Dominik Hasek. The Stars were led by captain Derian Hatcher, head coach Ken Hitchcock and goaltender Ed Belfour. The Stars defeated the Sabres four games to two to win their first Stanley Cup, becoming the eighth post-1967 expansion team to earn a championship, and the first team based in the Southern United States to win the Cup. The series ended with a controversial triple-overtime goal in game six, when replays showed that Stars forward Brett Hull scored with his skate in the crease. Although the Sabres protested later, the league stated that the goal had been reviewed and was judged as a good goal, since Hull had maintained possession of the puck as it exited the crease just before he shot it. Background Buffalo defeated the Ottawa Senators 4–0, the Boston Bruins 4–2 and Toronto Maple Leafs 4–1 to advance to the final. Dallas defeated the Edmonton Oilers 4–0, the St. Louis Blues 4–2 and the Colorado Avalanche 4–3 to advance to the final. Game summaries =Game one= The opening game was in Dallas and it was the visiting Buffalo Sabres who struck first, winning 3–2 in overtime. Dallas led 1-0 on a power play goal by Brett Hull, but Stu Barnes and Wayne Primeau scored 5:04 apart in the third to give Buffalo a 2–1 lead. Jere Lehtinen tied the game in the final minute of the third period, but Jason Woolley scored at 15:30 of overtime to give the Sabres the series lead. =Game two= With three seconds left in the period, Dallas center Mike Modano tripped Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek, and a number of scrums broke out as time expired. Dallas winger Joe Nieuwendyk fought Buffalo center Brian Holzinger in the circle to the right of Hasek. These were the first fighting majors in three years in the final round, and it was also Nieuwendyk's first fighting major in five years in either the playoffs or regular season. After the scoreless opening period, the teams traded goals in the middle frame. Craig Ludwig's first goal in 102 playoff games gave Dallas its first lead of the game in the third period, but Alexei Zhitnik tied it 71 seconds later. Brett Hull scored on a slap shot, a one-timer on a pass from Tony Hrkac, from the top of the circle to Hasek's left with 2:50 remaining in the game, but Buffalo had an excellent chance to tie the game with Derian Hatcher being assessed a high- sticking minor 19 seconds later. During the power play, Buffalo pulled Hasek for a 6-on-4 attacking advantage, but the Stars were able to kill the penalty, and Hatcher scored an empty-netter just three seconds after emerging from the penalty box. The empty net goal sealed the win for Dallas, and evened the series at one game apiece. Mike Modano left the game with approximately ten minutes to play after suffering a broken wrist. =Game three= The series shifted to Buffalo for games three and four. It was the visiting Dallas Stars turn to win one on the road, winning 2–1. With Modano hampered by his wrist injury, and Hull leaving the game with a groin injury, Joe Nieuwendyk's two goals, including his sixth game-winner of the playoffs, led Dallas to the win. =Game four= Facing a two games to one deficit in the series, the Sabres came through with a 2–1 victory. =Game five= With the series tied at two games apiece and returning to Dallas, Ed Belfour made 23 saves to shut out the Sabres, and move Dallas within one win of the Stanley Cup. =Game six= The series shifted back to Marine Midland Arena for the sixth game on June 19, 1999, where the Dallas Stars would seek their first Stanley Cup, while the Buffalo Sabres would fight for a win to extend the series to a seventh and final game. Dallas, which allowed the first goal in the earlier two games played at Marine Midland Arena, took a 1–0 lead on one of its few scoring chances in the first period when Lehtinen scored his tenth goal of the playoffs at 8:09. The Sabres tied the game with their first goal since the third period of game four when Barnes' wrist shot eluded Belfour with 1:39 to play in the second period. The game remained tied at one through the third period and the first two overtime periods, despite several chances by both teams to score. At 14:51 of the third overtime period, Brett Hull scored to end the series and win Dallas their first Stanley Cup. It was the longest Cup- winning game in Finals history, and the second-longest Finals game overall, after game one of the 1990 Stanley Cup Finals, which ended at 15:13 of the third overtime. This was the first time since 1994 that the Stanley Cup Finals did not end in a sweep. It is the Stars' only Stanley Cup win, while Buffalo has not returned to the Finals since. It was the Sabres' second Stanley Cup Finals appearance; the first was a loss to Philadelphia in 1975. It was the third appearance for the Stars' franchise, and their first since moving to Dallas from Minnesota in 1993. Minnesota (known at the time as the North Stars) lost in the Finals to the New York Islanders in 1981 and to Pittsburgh in 1991. Dallas returned to the Finals in 2000 but lost to the New Jersey Devils. Hull's series-ending goal In the third overtime, Jere Lehtinen took a shot from from the left circle that was stopped by Dominik Hasek. Brett Hull was not in the crease for the first shot. The rebound came near Hull's left skate, which Hull used to kick the puck to his stick, which was just outside the crease. His left skate entered the crease just before his second shot went in and ended the series. None of the Sabres players or coaches questioned the legality of the goal in the immediate aftermath. It was not until league commissioner Gary Bettman was on the ice to hand out the trophies that Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff returned to his bench and began screaming at Bettman to explain why the goal had not been reviewed. In the Sabres' locker room, players who had seen the replays were infuriated. Hasek recalled, \\"My first reaction was 'Let's get back on the ice.' But it's 2 o'clock in the morning and I look at everyone and it's like, 'I'm already out of my pants. It's impossible.'\\" The NHL had sent a private memo out earlier in the season with a clarification to the in-the-crease rule. The memo stated that if a player was in control of the puck, a skate could be in the crease even if the puck was not, and a goal in that circumstance would count. NHL Director of Officiating Bryan Lewis said after the game that the goal had been reviewed, just as every goal that season had been, and the officials in the video review booth had determined that since Hull was deemed to have been in possession of the puck throughout the play, he was allowed to shoot and score a goal, even though one skate had entered the crease before the puck. Among Sabres fans, both the game and the play itself are often simply referred to as \\"No Goal\\".

History The reef is named after Pierre Dollabarats, Basque captain of the ship Maria de Sebourre, who accidentally discovered the reef when his small boat wrecked on it on 7 March 1788. Since 16 June 2008, Dollabarat Reef and the neighboring Formigas Islets have been recognized as a Ramsar Convention wetland under the name Ilhéus das Formigas e Recife Dollabarat (reference number 1804). Geography The Dollabarat Reef is part of the Formigas Islets Nature Reserve which covers .Tomaz Dentinho, João Lima & Ana Tavares (2000), p.2 Around the Formigas Reserve, including the Dollabarat, sea cliffs fall rapidly between , although gently to the north and south. The gradient around the Dollabarat is less accentuated. The highest point is below sea level. Dollabarat Reef is one of the higher parts of the Formigas Bank, a seamount with similar volcanic origins as the Azores islands. The reef was formed from rocks emerging from volcanic activity in submarine volcanoes and deeper spaces composed of drained lava holes with an irregular morphology. The deeper parts of the Dollabarat are covered with large rocks and irregular plains covered with a carpet of seaweeds. Given the relatively shallow waters, the reef is a peril to navigation, similar to sandy shorelines. =Biome= The strong currents, deep waters, and presence of sharks make diving difficult for those not familiar with open-ocean diving. The sub-tidal zone is a shelter for many fish species, and the abundance of black coral located about deep in the eastern part of the reef has resulted in a small reef habitat.Tomaz Dentinho, João Lima & Ana Tavares (2000), p.3 There is a large abundance of sea animals in the vicinity. In addition to species of sharks, other aquatic animals such as sea chub, trigger fish, mantas, turtles and dolphins have been observed in the waters around Dollabarat, including the Atlantic goliath grouper (usually found in depths between 10–40 m). The floor of the seamount is generally covered by a dense layer of seaweed, dominated by the Cystoseira species, a seaweed found in deeper areas. In shallower depths less than from the surface there are populations of Laminaria (large colonies of chestnut seaweeds). The Department of Oceanography and Fisheries at the University of the Azores (Ponta Delgada) monitors and studies these species annually through scientific missions to the reef and surrounding islets.

The conclave began on 2 September and ended 26 days later with the election of Cardinal Annibale Sermattei della Genga who became Pope Leo XII. Pius VII, who had been elected in 1800, had reigned as Pope for what was considered a very long pontificate. During his reign as Pope, the Catholic Church had faced, in the French Revolution and its aftermath, a severe attack on its power and legitimacy. Pius himself had been a prisoner of Napoleon in France for six years. Description During Pius VII's papacy, the cardinals had tended to divide into two groups, the zelanti and the '. The zelanti were more radically reactionary than the ' and wanted a highly centralised Church and vehement opposition to the secularising reforms that had resulted in France. The ', though anti-liberal, were much more moderate and favoured a conciliatory approach to dealing with the problems that new ideologies and the incipient Industrial Revolution were creating. The leader of this faction was Pius VII's Cardinal Secretary of State, Ercole Consalvi, but the zelanti wanted a much less moderate pontiff and they set fervently to this task from the time of Pius VII's death. The length of Pius VII's papacy had a significant influence because of the forty-nine electors who participated in the conclave, only Giulio Maria della Somaglia and Fabrizio Dionigio Ruffo were already cardinals when Pius VII was elected in 1800. Forty-seven of the forty-nine electors had had no experience electing a pope. A number of cardinals were thought at the beginning of the conclave to be possible successors to Pius VII. Antonio Gabriele Severoli was at first seen as the most likely papabile, but the veto of Francis I, Emperor of Austria ruled him out when he looked to have a reasonable chance. Francesco Saverio Castiglioni then emerged as the most likely candidate. The deceased pope Pius VII had in fact seemingly endorsed Castiglioni by having referred to the latter as Pius VIII, and indeed the candidate who was eventually elected predicted during the conclave that Castiglioni would someday reign under that name (as he did, succeeding the elected Leo in 1829). Castiglioni lost support in the 1823 conclave when the zelanti Cardinals came to realize that he was quite close to Consalvi. Following the decline of Castigioni's support in this conclave, the experienced Cardinal della Somaglia then had a turn as a possible candidate, but for some the mere fact that he had signed his letters \\"Citizen Somaglia\\" during the occupation of the Papal States by Napoleon I of France ruled him out. It was only then that the eventual winner, Vicar of Rome Annibale della Genga, who was being promoted by the zelanti, began to gather support. Whilst his tall, ascetic look and reactionary reputation was not an attraction for the ', the fact that he was seemingly at death's door seemed an attraction for those cardinals by now desperate for a resolution of the conclave. As a result, della Genga was elected on 28 September and took the regnal name Leo XII. Leo XII was crowned as Pope on 5 October 1823. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto; width:350px; border- collapse:collapse;\\" + PAPAL CONCLAVE, 1823 - ! style=\\"background:#8888aa;\\"Duration ! style=\\"background:#8888aa;\\"26 days - ! style=\\"background:#8888aa;\\"Electors ! style=\\"background:#8888aa;\\"53 - !style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\"Present  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"49 - !style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\"Absent  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4 - !style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\"Veto used  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"by Emperor Francis I of Austria against Antonio Gabriele Severoli - ! style=\\"background:#8888aa;\\"DECEASED POPE ! style=\\"background:#8888aa;\\"PIUS VII (1800–1823) - ! style=\\"background:#8888aa;\\"NEW POPE ! style=\\"background:#8888aa;\\"LEO XII (1823–1829) } See also *Fabrizio Turriozzi References Sources *Artaud de Montor, Alexis François (1843).

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 7, 1999. In the episode, a school presentation on sexual harassment prevention leads to Cartman suing Stan for sexual harassment, which in turn kicks off a series of sexual harassment lawsuits across South Park. This was the first episode to air after the release of the theatrical film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. According to the DVD commentary of the episode, Parker and Stone were so exhausted and hungover from doing the South Park film, that they have no memory of making this episode. Plot Mr. Garrison's class is visited by an educational mascot, \\"Petey the Sexual Harassment Panda\\", who attempts to teach the kids about sexual harassment so as to prevent it in school. During the visit, Stan calls Cartman an \\"ass-sucker\\", and Cartman, \\"inspired\\" by the panda's teaching, sues Stan for sexual harassment claiming that he's sexually harassed him for the last time; Kyle's father, Gerald Broflovski, acts as his lawyer, and Cartman wins half of Stan's possessions. Gerald then decides to encourage Cartman (and later, others) not only to sue each other but also the teachers and the school, leading to chaos throughout the town as he gets rich. Kyle's dad quickly becomes the target of many people's wrath, while he continues to renovate his family's house into a mansion with his newly gained assets. Soon afterwards the whole town is suing each other and Gerald is taking advantage of this by being a lawyer for them all, getting more and more money from every case. Because everyone is scared of being sued, no one can stand up to Gerald. Because the school board needs to cut costs, Sexual Harassment Panda is fired. He cannot get a new job as a panda mascot, and refuses to change his costume due to an apparently genuine belief that he's a panda. Thus, he goes to the Island of Misfit Mascots Commune, for mascots whose messages simply make no sense (one mascot kills Kenny by accident). Many mascots there also seem to believe they are the animals they portray. The boys, however, seeing the negative results of the lawsuits on their school, track Sexual Harassment Panda down and convince him to return to town with a new message. Meanwhile, Gerald is litigating the biggest sexual harassment lawsuit ever, Everyone v. Everyone, where he represents everyone who hires him to take on everyone else (flagrantly disregarding conflict of interest in the process). The panda arrives back in South Park under a new name, \\"Petey the Don't Sue People Panda\\", and delivers a sermon on how people should not sue each other constantly because it does nothing but damage the school system, taking away money from classrooms, schools and themselves, the taxpayers. The people, realizing the sagacity of this statement, angrily cry that they should sue Gerald, who quickly agrees to file no more lawsuits about sexual harassment in schools or anywhere else. In the end, all the sexual harassment suits are dropped and Kyle's dad presumably gets away with millions of dollars. Cultural references This episode satirizes the widely publicized lawsuits over sexual harassment in schools that occurred in the late 1990s, as well as ambulance-chasing lawyers. The Island of Misfit Mascots Commune is a parody of The Island of Misfit Toys from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Sexual Harassment Panda is a parody of Ike the Coast Guard Panda, a mascot for the United States Coast Guard who encourages kids to wear life vests. Parker and Stone indicated in the DVD commentary that the panda is Santa Claus from \\"Jesus vs. Frosty\\", as they have the same voice.

He was a wealthy accountant working as treasurer for the aviation pioneers Grover and Albert Loening who had agreed to invest in the company and invested $100,000 of his own money when the company was created. The New York City native was the son of astronomer Charles Lane Poor and Anna Louise Easton and studied at both Williams College and Columbia University, obtaining his B.A. in 1927. He was the treasurer of the village of Dering Harbor on Shelter Island. He and wife Catharine B. Wynkoop of Bath, New York, were the parents of Edmund W. Poor, Jr. of the Boston Computer Society and Professor Henry W. Poor of the University of Miami in Florida. He subsequently married Fannie B. Moore in West Islip in December 1950. Poor was an accomplished sailor, active in one design and offshore classes throughout his life. In 1961 he purchased a Block Island 40 yawl, which he named Starward. The name was created by combining his then wife Fannie's middle name, Starbird, with his own middle name. He campaigned Starward actively, with a crew of friends and family, including his sons Edmund and Henry, and his stepson and stepdaughter, John and Sally, Sally's husband, Dr. Pier Mancusi-Ungaro, and Sally's young son, Greg Mancusi- Ungaro. Poor fulfilled a lifelong dream when he skippered Starward in the 1962 Bermuda Race.

It connects LeClaire Park to a courtyard and parking ramp on 2nd Street, located near the River Music Experience. The bridge, completed in 2005, is tall, long, and features columns. It was designed by Holabird & Roothttp://holabird.com/work/detail/city-of-davenport-pedestrian- skybridge and Neumann Monson, P.C.http://neumannmonson.com/skybridge/ At the south end, facing the river, is an observation deck with a view of the Mississippi River, LeClaire Park Bandshell, the Centennial Bridge, and the Davenport Levee, where many festivals take place throughout the warmer months. The inside of the Skybridge contains kaleidoscope lighting. The lighting consists of 228 LED fixtures and 8,036 individual lights. The LEDs are capable of displaying various patterns. The lighting color and patterns can be adjusted for events occurring in the area, such as a red, white, and blue color scheme for the Independence Day; red and green for Christmas; and various other patterns. The Skybridge was a component of the Riverfront/Downtown Davenport improvement program, River Renaissance. The total cost of the structure was $7 million. Iowa taxpayers provided $3.5 million in the form of a Vision Iowa grant, Rhythm City Casino paid $2 million, and the City of Davenport taxpayers spent $500,000 for its initial construction. The Riverboat Development Authority, the agency responsible for distributing some of the taxes collected from Rhythm City, allocated $1.3 million. The bridge's stated purpose is to serve as a tourist attraction with a unique vantage point of the Mississippi River, while also functioning as a safe way to cross the highway.

Overview  D-Bus is an IPC mechanism initially designed to replace the software component communications systems used by the GNOME and KDE Linux desktop environments (CORBA and DCOP respectively). The components of these desktop environments are normally distributed in many processes, each one providing only a few --usually one-- services. These services may be used by regular client applications or by other components of the desktop environment to perform their tasks. Due to the large number of processes involved --adding up processes providing the services and clients accessing them-- establishing one-to-one IPC communications between all of them becomes an inefficient and quite unreliable approach. Instead, D-Bus provides a software-bus abstraction that gathers all the communications between a group of processes over a single shared virtual channel. Processes connected to a bus don't know how it is internally implemented, but D-Bus specification guarantees that all processes connected to the bus can communicate with each other through it. Linux desktop environments take advantage of the D-Bus facilities by instantiating not one bus but many: * a single system bus, available to all users and processes of the system, that provides access to system services (i.e. services provided by the operating system and also by any system daemons) * a session bus for each user login session, that provides desktop services to user applications in the same desktop session, and allows the integration of the desktop session as a whole A process can connect to any number of buses, provided that it has been granted access to them. In practice, this means that any user process can connect to the system bus and to its current session bus, but not to another user's session buses, or even to a different session bus owned by the same user. The latter restriction may change in the future if all user sessions are combined into a single user bus. D-Bus provides additional or simplifies existing functionality to the applications, including information-sharing, modularity and privilege separation. For example, information on an incoming voice-call received through Bluetooth or Skype can be propagated and interpreted by any currently-running music player, which can react by muting the volume or by pausing playback until the call is finished. D-Bus can also be used as a framework to integrate different components of a user application. For instance, an office suite can communicate through the session bus to share data between a word processor and a spreadsheet.  D-Bus specification  = Bus model = Every connection to a bus is identified in the context of D-Bus by what is called a bus name. A bus name consists of two or more dot-separated strings of letters, digits, dashes, and underscores. An example of a valid bus name is . When a process sets up a connection to a bus, the bus assigns to the connection a special bus name called unique connection name. Bus names of this type are immutable--it's guaranteed they won't change as long as the connection exists--and, more importantly, they can't be reused during the bus lifetime. This means that no other connection to that bus will ever have assigned such unique connection name, even if the same process closes down the connection to the bus and creates a new one. Unique connection names are easily recognizable because they start with the--otherwise forbidden --colon character. An example of a unique connection name is (the characters after the colon have no particular meaning). A process can ask for additional bus names for its connection, provided that any requested name is not already being used by another connection to the bus. In D-Bus parlance, when a bus name is assigned to a connection, it is said the connection owns the bus name. In that sense, a bus name can't be owned by two connections at the same time, but, unlike unique connection names, these names can be reused if they are available: a process may reclaim a bus name released --purposely or not-- by another process. The idea behind these additional bus names, commonly called well-known names, is to provide a way to refer to a service using a prearranged bus name. For instance, the service that reports the current time and date in the system bus lies in the process whose connection owns the bus name, regardless of which process it is. Bus names can be used as a simple way to implement single instance applications (second instances detect that the bus name is already taken). It can also be used to track a service process lifecycle, since the bus sends a notification when a bus name is released due to a process termination. = Object model = Because of its original conception as a replacement for several component oriented communications systems, D-Bus shares with its predecessors an object model in which to express the semantics of the communications between clients and services. The terms used in the D-Bus object model mimic those used by some object oriented programming languages. That doesn't mean that D-Bus is somehow limited to OOP languages --in fact, the most used implementation () is written in C, a procedural programming language. Browsing the existing bus names, objects, interfaces, methods and signals in a D-Bus bus using D-Feet In D-Bus, a process offers its services by exposing objects. These objects have methods that can be invoked, and signals that the object can emit. Methods and signals are collectively referred to as the members of the object. Any client connected to the bus can interact with an object by using its methods, making requests or commanding the object to perform actions. For instance, an object representing a time service can be queried by a client using a method that returns the current date and time. A client can also listen to signals that an object emits when its state changes due to certain events, usually related to the underlying service. An example would be when a service that manages hardware devices --such as USB or network drivers-- signals a \\"new hardware device added\\" event. Clients should instruct the bus that they are interested in receiving certain signals from a particular object, since a D-Bus bus only passes signals to those processes with a registered interest in them. A process connected to a D-Bus bus can request it to export as many D-Bus objects as it wants. Each object is identified by an object path, a string of numbers, letters and underscores separated and prefixed by the slash character, called that because of their resemblance to Unix filesystem paths. The object path is selected by the requesting process, and must be unique in the context of that bus connection. An example of a valid object path is . However, it's not enforced --but also not discouraged-- to form hierarchies within object paths. The particular naming convention for the objects of a service is entirely up to the developers of such service, but many developers choose to namespace them using the reserved domain name of the project as a prefix (e.g. ). Every object is inextricably associated to the particular bus connection where it was exported, and, from the D-Bus point of view, only lives in the context of such connection. Therefore, in order to be able to use a certain service, a client must indicate not only the object path providing the desired service, but also the bus name under which the service process is connected to the bus. This in turn allows that several processes connected to the bus can export different objects with identical object paths unambiguously. Members --methods and signals-- that can be used with an object are specified by an interface. An interface is a set of declarations of methods (including its passing and returning parameters) and signals (including its parameters) identified by a dot-separated name resembling the Java language interfaces notation. An example of a valid interface name is . Despite their similarity, interface names and bus names should not be mistaken. A D-Bus object can implement several interfaces, but at least must implement one, providing support for every method and signal defined by it. The combination of all interfaces implemented by an object is called the object type. When using an object, it's a good practice for the client process to provide the member's interface name besides the member's name, but is only mandatory when there is an ambiguity caused by duplicated member names available from different interfaces implemented by the object --otherwise, the selected member is undefined or erroneous. An emitted signal, on the other hand, must always indicate to which interface it belongs. The D-Bus specification also defines several standard interfaces that objects may want to implement in addition to its own interfaces. Although technically optional, most D-Bus service developers choose to support them in their exported objects since they offer important additional features to D-Bus clients, such as introspection. These standard interfaces are: * : provides a way to test if a D-Bus connection is alive. * : provides an introspection mechanism by which a client process can, at run-time, get a description (in XML format) of the interfaces, methods and signals that the object implements. * : allows a D-Bus object to expose the underlying native object properties or attributes, or simulate them if it doesn't exist. * : when a D-Bus service arranges its objects hierarchically, this interface provides a way to query an object about all sub-objects under its path, as well as their interfaces and properties, using a single method call. The D-Bus specification defines a number of administrative bus operations (called \\"bus services\\") to be performed using the object that resides in the bus name. Each bus reserves this special bus name for itself, and manages any requests made specifically to this combination of bus name and object path. The administrative operations provided by the bus are those defined by the object's interface . These operations are used for example to provide information about the status of the bus, or to manage the request and release of additional well-known bus names. = Communications model = D-Bus was conceived as a generic, high-level inter-process communication system. To accomplish such goals, D-Bus communications are based on the exchange of messages between processes instead of \\"raw bytes\\". D-Bus messages are high-level discrete items that a process can send through the bus to another connected process. Messages have a well- defined structure (even the types of the data carried in their payload are defined), allowing the bus to validate them and to reject any ill-formed message. In this regard, D-Bus is closer to an RPC mechanism than to a classic IPC mechanism, with its own type definition system and its own marshaling. Example of one-to-one request-response message exchange to invoke a method over D-Bus. Here the client process invokes the method of the object from the service process named (or ) in the bus. The bus supports two modes of interchanging messages between a client and a service process: * One-to-one request-response: This is the way for a client to invoke an object's method. The client sends a message to the service process exporting the object, and the service in turn replies with a message back to the client process. The message sent by the client must contain the object path, the name of the invoked method (and optionally the name of its interface), and the values of the input parameters (if any) as defined by the object's selected interface. The reply message carries the result of the request, including the values of the output parameters returned by the object's method invocation, or exception information if there was an error. * Publish/subscribe: This is the way for an object to announce the occurrence of a signal to the interested parties. The object's service process broadcasts a message that the bus passes only to the connected clients subscribed to the object's signal. The message carries the object path, the name of the signal, the interface to which the signal belongs, and also the values of the signal's parameters (if any). The communication is one-way: there are no response messages to the original message from any client process, since the sender knows neither the identities nor the number of the recipients. Every D-Bus message consists of a header and a body. The header is formed by several fields that identify the type of message, the sender, as well as information required to deliver the message to its recipient (destination bus name, object path, method or signal name, interface name, etc.). The body contains the data payload that the receiver process interprets --for instance the input or output arguments. All the data is encoded in a well known binary format called the wire format which supports the serialization of various types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, strings, compound types, and so on, also referred to as marshaling. The D-Bus specification defines the wire protocol: how to build the D-Bus messages to be exchanged between processes within a D-Bus connection. However, it does not define the underlying transport method for delivering these messages.  Internals  Most existing D-Bus implementations follow the architecture of the reference implementation. This architecture consists of two main components: * a point-to-point communications library that implements the D-Bus wire protocol in order to exchange messages between two processes. In the reference implementation this library is '. In other implementations may be wrapped by another higher-level library, language binding, or entirely replaced by a different standalone implementation that serves the same purpose. This library only supports one-to-one communications between two processes. * A process acting as a D-Bus message bus daemon. Every process connected to the bus keeps one D-Bus connection with it.a special daemon process that plays the bus role and to which the rest of the processes connect using any D-Bus point-to-point communications library. This process is also known as the message bus daemon, since it is responsible for routing messages from any process connected to the bus to another. In the reference implementation this role is performed by ', which itself is built on top of . Another implementation of the message bus daemon is ', which is built on top of '. The library (or its equivalent) internally uses a native lower-level IPC mechanism to transport the required D-Bus messages between the two processes in both ends of the D-Bus connection. D-Bus specification doesn't mandate which particular IPC transport mechanisms should be available to use, as it's the communications library that decides what transport methods it supports. For instance, in Linux and Unix-like operating systems typically uses Unix domain sockets as the underlying transport method, but it also supports TCP sockets. The communications libraries of both processes must agree on the selected transport method and also on the particular channel used for their communication. This information is defined by what D-Bus calls an address. Unix-domain socket are filesystem objects, and therefore they can be identified by a filename, so a valid address would be \`unix:path=/tmp/.hiddensocket\`. Both processes must pass the same address to their respective communications libraries to establish the D-Bus connection between them. An address can also provide additional data to the communications library in the form of comma-separated \`key=value\` pairs. This way, for example, it can provide authentication information to a specific type of connection that supports it. When a message bus daemon like is used to implement a D-Bus bus, all processes that want to connect to the bus must know the bus address, the address by which a process can establish a D-Bus connection to the central message bus process. In this scenario, the message bus daemon selects the bus address and the remainder processes must pass that value to their corresponding or equivalent libraries. defines a different bus address for every bus instance it provides. These addresses are defined in the daemon's configuration files. Two processes can use a D-Bus connection to exchange messages directly between them, but this is not the way in which D-Bus is normally intended to be used. The usual way is to always use a message bus daemon (i.e. ) as a communications central point to which each process should establish its point-to-point D-Bus connection. When a process --client or service-- sends a D-Bus message, the message bus process receives it in the first instance and delivers it to the appropriate recipient. The message bus daemon may be seen as a hub or router in charge of getting each message to its destination by repeating it through the D-Bus connection to the recipient process. The recipient process is determined by the destination bus name in the message's header field, or by the subscription information to signals maintained by the message bus daemon in the case of signal propagation messages. The message bus daemon can also produce its own messages as a response to certain conditions, such as an error message to a process that sent a message to a nonexistent bus name. improves the feature set already provided by D-Bus itself with additional functionality. For example, service activation allows automatic starting of services when needed --when the first request to any bus name of such service arrives at the message bus daemon. This way, service processes neither need to be launched during the system initialization or user initialization stage nor need they consume memory or other resources when not being used. This feature was originally implemented using setuid helpers, but nowadays it can also be provided by systemd's service activation framework. Service activation is an important feature that facilitates the management of the process lifecycle of services (for example when a desktop component should start or stop).  History and adoption  D-Bus was started in 2002 by Havoc Pennington, Alex Larsson (Red Hat) and Anders Carlsson. The version 1.0 --considered API stable-- was released in November 2006. The plays a significant role in modern Linux graphical desktop environments. Heavily influenced by the DCOP system used by versions 2 and 3 of KDE, D-Bus has replaced DCOP in the KDE 4 release. An implementation of D-Bus supports most POSIX operating systems, and a port for Windows exists. It is used by Qt 4 and GNOME. In GNOME it has gradually replaced most parts of the earlier Bonobo mechanism. It is also used by Xfce. One of the earlier adopters was the (nowadays deprecated) Hardware Abstraction Layer. HAL used D-Bus to export information about hardware that has been added to or removed from the computer. The usage of D-Bus is steadily expanding beyond the initial scope of desktop environments to cover an increasing amount of system services. For instance, NetworkManager network daemon, BlueZ bluetooth stack and PulseAudio sound server use D-Bus to provide part or all of its services. systemd uses the D-Bus wire protocol for communication between and systemd, and is also promoting traditional system daemons to D-Bus services, such as logind. Another heavy user of D-Bus is Polkit, whose policy authority daemon is implemented as a service connected to the system bus. It is also used as the Wire protocol for the AllJoyn protocol for home automation, to this end AllJoyn adds discovery, session management, security, header compression, embedded device support and makes it transport agnostic.  Implementations  = libdbus = Although there are several implementations of D-Bus, the most widely used is the reference implementation libdbus, developed by the same freedesktop.org project that designed the specification. However, libdbus is a low-level implementation that was never meant to be used directly by application developers, but as a reference guide for other reimplementations of D-Bus (such as those included in standard libraries of desktop environments, or in programming language bindings). The freedesktop.org project itself recommends applications authors to \\"use one of the higher level bindings or implementations\\" instead. The predominance of libdbus as the most used D-Bus implementation caused the terms \\"D-Bus\\" and \\"libdbus\\" to be often used interchangeably, leading to confusion. = GDBus = GDBus is an implementation of D-Bus based on GIO streams included in GLib, aiming to be used by GTK+ and GNOME. GDBus is not a wrapper of libdbus, but a complete and independent reimplementation of the D-Bus specification and protocol. MATE Desktop and Xfce (version 4.14), which are also based on GTK+ 3, also use GDBus. = QtDBus = QtDBus is an implementation of D-Bus included in the Qt library since its version 4.2. This component is used by KDE applications, libraries and components to access the D-Bus services available in a system. = sd-bus = In 2013, the systemd project rewrote libdbus in an effort to simplify the code, but it also resulted in a significant increase of the overall D-Bus performance. In preliminary benchmarks, BMW found that the systemd's D-Bus library increased performance by 360%. By version 221 of systemd, the sd-bus API was declared stable. = libnih-dbus = The libnih project provides a light-weight \\"standard library\\" of C support for D-Bus. Additionally, it has good support for cross compiling. = kdbus = kdbus is implemented as a character device driver. All communication between processes take place over special character device nodes in \`/dev/kdbus\` (cf. devfs). kdbus was a project that aimed to reimplement D-Bus as a kernel-mediated peer- to-peer inter-process communication mechanism. Beside performance improvements, kdbus would have advantages arising from other Linux kernel features such as namespaces and auditing, security from the kernel mediating, closing race conditions, and allowing D-Bus to be used during boot and shutdown (as needed by systemd). kdbus inclusion in the Linux kernel proved controversial, and was dropped in favor of BUS1, as a more generic inter- process communication. = Language bindings = Several programming language bindings for D-Bus have been developed, such as those for Java, C# and Ruby.

Commodore Perry was outfitted as a gunboat with heavy guns and a large crew of 125 officers and enlisted personnel. Her powerful guns were capable of doing considerable damage to blockade runners or shore fortifications of the Confederate States of America. Built in New York in 1859 Commodore Perry — an armed, side-wheel ferry — was built in 1859 by Stack and Joyce, Williamsburg, New York; purchased by the Navy on 2 October 1861; and commissioned later in the month, Acting Master F. J. Thomas in command. The ship was named in honor of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, who commanded American forces on Lake Erie in the War of 1812, and his brother Matthew Calbraith Perry, who negotiated the Convention of Kanagawa historic treaty which opened Japan to American commerce, and who had died the previous year, in 1858. Civil War service =Assigned to the North Atlantic blockade= Commodore Perry sailed from Hampton Roads, Virginia on 17 January 1862 to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and on 7–8 February took part in the attack, in cooperation with the Union Army, which resulted in the surrender of Roanoke Island, part of the long campaign through which the Navy secured key coastal points. On the 9th of July, 1862, at 2 a. m., the United States gunboats Commodore Perry, Shawsheen and Ceres, left Plymouth, N.C., and steamed up the Roanoke River on an expedition to Hamilton, where a large force of Confederates was reported to be stationed. On the Perry, which was commanded by Lieut. O. W. Flusser. U. S. N., were 20 men of Co. F, of the 9th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, (Hawkins' Zouaves,) under Capt. W. W. Hammell. On the Shawsheen were 10 men of the same company under Sergeant David J. (better known as Jack) Green, and ten men on the Ceres, commanded by Lieut. Joseph A. Greene, also of Co. F. Lieut. Flusser, in his report to Flag Officer Goldborough, says: \\"About 1 o'clock p.m. in. we were fired upon from the south bank of the river by musketry, returned the fire with great guns and small arms, and pushed on for Hamilton, where I hoped to meet the enemy in force. We were under fire for two hours running very slowly and keeping a lookout for a battery. Two or three miles below Hamilton we found a deserted battery. At Hamilton we landed 100 men, soldiers and sailors, and one field piece, but the rebels, who fired on us from high banks, where they were comparatively safe, were afraid to meet us. The steamer Wilson, belonging to the rebels, run into our hands at Hamilton and was taken possession of. The officers and men both soldiers and sailors behaved with great spirit.\\" Acting Master Mac Diarmid, in command of the Ceres, in his report of the affair to his superior officer, under the date of July 10, 1862, says : \\"When within a few miles of Hamilton, was fired on by the enemy from the left bank with small arms. Returned fire with great guns and small arms. This firing was kept up on both sides until within one-half mile of Hamilton. Lieutenant Greene was wounded in the leg by first volley, but sat on deck and loaded the muskets for his men.\\" Commodore Perry took part in the capture of Elizabeth City, North Carolina on 10 February, and the next day captured the schooner Lynnhaven. As operations along the North Carolina coast continued, she joined in the capture of and in March, and in April took singly or in concert with others of her squadron four schooners and a sloop in the Pasquotank River and New Begun Creek. On 3 October, Commodore Perry joined in an Army-Navy expedition against Franklin, Virginia, and on 10 December joined an attack against Plymouth, North Carolina. Four crewmen were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the expedition against Franklin: Boatswain's Mate John Breen, Seaman Daniel Lakin, Seaman Alfred Peterson, and Seaman John Williams. After another combined expedition against Hertford, North Carolina on 30 January 1863, Commodore Perry patrolled constantly in Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds and the streams which enter them, frequently exchanging fire with small detachments of Confederates ashore. =Repaired at Norfolk and at Baltimore= Repaired at Norfolk, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland late in 1863, she returned to her squadron in March 1864 for duty in the inland and coastal waters of Virginia on picket, guard, and patrol duty, joining in many amphibious expeditions, until the close of the war. Post-war decommissioning She sailed from Norfolk for New York City on 12 June 1865, and there was decommissioned on 26 June. On 12 July, she was sold to the New York and Brooklyn Ferry Company for $16,500 ($ in present day terms). Note As of 2020, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named Commodore Perry. However, the United States Revenue Cutter Service, a precursor to the United States Coast Guard, had at least two ships named Commodore Perry. See and for other ships named for Oliver Hazard Perry.

Early years Mills was born on September 1, 1815 near Syracuse, in Onondaga County, New York. When his father passed away he was sent to his uncle's but found that he was too harsh so he ran away. He had very little formal education. Before he turned 22, he had worked as a \\"teamster, lumberjack, farmhand, carpenter, and millwright.\\" When he was quite young Mills was apprenticed to a millwright in New York. When he was twenty years old, in 1835, he overwintered in New Orleans. In 1837, he moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he began to work as an ornamental plasterer. In the 1840s, he developed a faster, easier method of making plaster life-masks, which he then used to make portrait busts. Wayne Craven, author of the 1968 book Sculpture in America, wrote that \\"What he learned he acquired from the life-mask itself, and this established his style as one strongly dependent upon naturalism.\\" His first stone carving was an 1845 bust of John C. Calhoun, who in 1845, was Charleston's \\"most distinguished citizen\\". The bust is in the Charleston's City Hall Museum; a bronze version was formerly in the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Clark Mills studio and foundries Clark Mills had a number of studios and foundries. From 1837 to 1848, Mills had his first studio on Broad Street, Charleston, South Carolina, which was assigned the National Historic Landmark designation on December 21, 1965 by the Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP). In 1849, in order to produce the Jackson equestrian statue, Mills built a temporary furnace and studio on the Ellipse at 15th and Pennsylvania Avenue, near LaFayette Square.There is a statue of General Sherman there currently, south of the Treasury Building. His equestrian statue of George Washington was also cast at this site. Mills purchased a parcel on the border of Maryland and the District of Columbia where is constructed his mansion and a large octagon-shaped studio and foundry on Bladensburg Road. It was at the Bladensburg foundry that the 1863 bronze Statue of Freedom was cast. Major works = Equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson= Equestrian statue Andrew Jackson, Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C. One of Mills' most well-known sculptures is the equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson, located in President's Park, also known as Lafayette Square, which is situated on the north portico side of the White House. Mills presented a submission to a competition for the contract to produce the statue. Mills' sculpture depicted Major Jackson on a rearing horse, raising his hat to the troops he was reviewing at the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815. He won the competition to create the statue in 1848 and moved from Charleston to Washington, bringing with him the enslaved master craftsman, Philip Reid (c. 1820 – February 6, 1892), whom he had purchased in 1842. Along with other workers, Mills had eleven slaves working for him. Reid and the other enslaved workers were freed with the passage of the April 16, 1862 District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act which freed thousands of slaves in that District. James M. Goode, (1939-2019), Washington, D. C. historian, who published numerous books relating to Washington, D.C. history, provided details behind the creation of the statue. Goode described how Mills used his own horse, Olympus as a model for the horse Jackson was riding at the Battle of New Orleans—Duke. According to Goode, Mills taught Olympus to \\"rear up on its hind legs during the modeling process.\\" Goode added that the public were \\"entranced\\" with Mill's statue in Washington. As a result, Mills cast three copies—that are now in \\"New Orleans (dedicated in 1856), Nashville (dedicated in 1880) and Jacksonville, Florida (dedicated 1987). Goode wrote that the statue was noteworthy as it was the first bronze statue cast in America and the \\"first equestrian statue in the world to be balanced on the horse's hind legs.\\" Goode also described the difficult casting process. Mills produced six castings of the statue of Andrew Jackson until the final one was completed, with ten pieces, six for Jackson and four for the horse. In his casting, he was assisted by Reid. The casting was completed 1852. Mills unveiled the 15 ton bronze statue of Andrew Jackson on January 8, 1853, the 38th anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans and according to one account by a reporter for the Washington Union, twenty thousand people attended in and around the park.

Gen. George Washington in 1860. Congress commissioned this work in 1853 because of the tremendous popularity of Mills' equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson. The elaborate high pedestal that Mills originally designed, with three tiers of sculptured relief panels and smaller equestrian statues of Washington's generals, were never executed because of a lack of adequate funds. =Statue of Freedom (1863)= Beginning in 1860, the Statue of Freedom, which sits atop the United States Capitol, was cast in five main sections by Mills with the assistance of Philip Reid. The casting was undertaken at Mills' foundry on his estate on the border of Maryland and D.C. =Abraham Lincoln (1865)= In 1865 Mills made a life- cast of Abraham Lincoln's head. It is generally felt to be inferior in technical quality to the 1860 cast made by Leonard Volk, but has the advantage of showing Lincoln's entire skull, not just the face as does Volk's.Clark Mills.

The Smithsonian has catalogued a series of life masks of native Americans, Mills made from 1875 to 1880. Mills made sixty-four native Americans from various tribes who had been imprisoned in Fort Marion, St. Augustine, Florida from 1875 onward in the aftermath of what was then-called the \\"American Indian Wars\\" in the west.\\"Removing Classrooms from the Battlefield: Liberty, Paternalism, and the Redemptive Promise of Educational Choice\\", BYU Law Review, 2008, p. 377 The collection was held in the name of Richard Henry Pratt, a Civil War veteran, who supervised the prisoners at that time. Mills also made life masks of forty- seven boys and girls at Hampton Roads, Hampton Normal and Educational Institute in Virginia in March 1879. Reviews of Mill's work In his biography of Mills, historian James Dillon, which was largely based on Wayne Craven's 1968 Sculpture in America, Dillon cited Craven, \\"In truth, Mills was a greater engineer than he was a sculptor. He deserves a special place.....for several reasons, but none of them is based primarily on aesthetic grounds or on the value of any piece or work of art....As an engineer and technician he was unsurpassed in his time in the casting of bronze; and special consideration should be given to his equestrian monument to Jackson and the brilliant solution he devised....\\" Dillon described Mills as a \\"pioneer in the working of the metal\\". Personal life Mills was married and had three sons. His second wife and stepdaughter cared for him in his old age. In 1846, Mills purchased a large tract of land from G. M. Clavert, that was partially in the Maryland and partially in District of Columbia, which included Meadow Bank Spa Spring. The parcel included a natural springs, locally known as Upper Hickey, which had a flow abundant enough for the operation of the foundry Mills planned to construct. This is where he built his large Bladensburg Road octagon-shaped foundry. When Mills moved to Washington from Charleston, South Carolina in 1848, he brought his slaves with him. By 1862, he had eleven slaves working for him—Lettie, Tilly, Tow, Ellick, Jackson, George, Emily, and Levi Howard, Rachel Thomas, Auw Rofs and Philip Reid. They were freed under the 1862 District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act, which entitled Mills to $5,200 in compensation. Glenwood Cemetery, Washington, D.C. Mills was 72 years old when died on January 12, 1883. He was interred at Glenwood Cemetery in Washington, D.C. The three sons challenged the will which gave almost all the estate to Mills' second wife and stepdaughter. In 1884, Mills' estate was auctioned off in a public sale, and subdivided, largely because of the \\"acrimonious dispute\\" between his sons and his stepdaughter and second wife. The brass foundry remained operational until 1903, long after Mill's death.

He has worked on The Emeril Lagasse Show and with Hot Tuna, G.E. Smith, Screaming Headless Torsos, KIF, Patrick Stump, and Cyndi Lauper. Biography Warner was born and raised in Newnan, Georgia. At the age of nine, his interest in playing drums led him to the church. Gospel played a soulful foundation for \\"The Funky Drummer\\". By the age of eleven he was touring the South with various then up- and coming Gospel groups. During high school he improved his percussive skills and played at school social functions and local clubs. Graduating from high school, he decided to go where musicians who wanted to make it went: New York City. After only a few weeks, Skoota was spotted playing with street breakdancers by Pepeu Gomes and Baby Consuelo, Brazil's top pop artists at that time. At age 18, Skoota left for Brazil with Pepeu and Baby where he lived for two years, playing live rock shows and recording several albums with Pepeu and other Brazilian artists. When Skoota returned to New York, he landed gigs with blues musicians Johnny Copeland and Johnnie Johnson. The following year, Skoota joined the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night House Band with whom he backed such R&B;, funk, and hip-hop stars as Keith Sweat, Guy, and Big Daddy Kane. Skoota's impromptu rhythm breaks incited live on-stage jams with guest hip-hop artists like Biz Markie, Doug E. Fresh, and Special Ed among others. 1989 hallmarked Skoota's ascending career when New York's premier studio drummer, Omar Hakim, chose him to be his drummer for the Rhythm Deep Project. Omar said \\"Skoota nails it! He's a drummer's drummer.\\" Since 1990, Skoota has played with such established artists as Santana, The B-52's, Arto Lindsay, Lionel Richie, Cyndi Lauper, Matisyahu, and Mary J. Blige.

In antiquity the title was also written Naupaktika (Latin Naupactica), and it is also in the present day sometimes referred to among scholars by the Latin phrase carmen Naupactium (\\"Naupactian poem\\"). Naupactus is a city in Greece on the Corinthian Gulf. The Naupactia was probably composed in the 6th or 5th century BCE. Its authorship is uncertain: most ancient writers simply refer to \\"the author of the Naupactia\\". The 2nd-century CE travelogue writer Pausanias, who in his work refers to the poem on several occasions, records that most people in his time considered that it was by an anonymous Milesian poet, but he himself judges that it was most likely by Carcinus of Naupactus; Pausanias' reasoning is open to doubt. It is not known how long the poem was. In current critical editions, only ten lines of the poem's text survive. Pausanias records that the poem was \\"written about women\\"; fewer than a dozen other fragmentary references give indications as to the content, but they tend to suggest that the content was largely genealogical. These two facts combined suggest similarities with the pseudo- Hesiodic poem the Catalogue of Women. More than half of the surviving fragments are devoted to the heroic story of the Argonauts: it is likely that this occupied a large proportion of the poem, and probably influenced later poetic accounts of the story such as Pindar's fourth Pythian ode, and the best-known version, Apollonius' Argonautica.

According to only one contemporary account, the flag was rumoured to be a gift from Alexander Macdonell of Greenfield of the North West Company in 1815, but no other surviving accounts confirm this. Both the red and blue versions of the flag have been used to represent the political and military force of the Métis since that time. The Métis flag predates the Flag of Canada by at least 150 years, and is the oldest patriotic flag that is indigenous to Canada. The blue background flag has been accepted by the Métis National Council as the official flag of the Métis Nation. In 2013, the Métis National Council secured an official mark for the flag to protect it as a symbol of the Métis Nation, and ensure its collective ownership by citizens of the Métis Nation.  Design and symbolism  The flag shows a white infinity symbol on a field of either blue or red. There are many interpretations of what the colours and symbol means. The infinity symbol has two commonly referred to meanings: it represents the faith that the Métis culture shall live on forever; and the mixing of the European immigrants and the First Nations peoples with the two conjoined circles symbolizing the unity of two cultures. Another possible interpretation of the infinity symbol is that it relates to traditional Métis dances, such as the quadrille, in which dancers move in a figure-eight pattern (though this might be an adoption of the symbol into traditional dances rather than the pattern in traditional dances being adopted on the flag). There might also be a connection to the ouroboros, an ancient symbol the depicts a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, represented either in a circle or figure eight, symbolizing renewal and rebirth (though there is no evidence to support this idea, and the first Masonic lodge to be established in Manitoba was not established until 1864, there is evidence that suggests Masons were present in Fort Prince of Wales in the early 18th Century). There might also be a connection to Celtic knotwork and Scottish influences that include Celtic knots, figure of eight in Scottish country dance, jewellery, etc. Others have suggested that the symbol is derived from the Plains First Nations Sign Language for Métis (reported as the symbol for \\"cart\\" combined with the symbol for \\"Man\\" in reference to the Métis' use of the Red River cart), with the symbol for cart being formed by joining the thumb and forefingers on each hand with the hands held together to form two circles. There is debate about the historical interpretations of the colours of the Métis flags. Some claim that the red background represents the colours of the Hudson’s Bay Company and that the blue background represents the North West Company, (though both the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company flew red flags that were a modification of the Red Ensign). Others argue that the blue flag represents the francophone Métis and the red flag represents the anglophone Métis. Others argue that the blue and white combination are based on both the Flag of Scotland, and are also the traditional colours of Quebec. Others have said that the red flag is for Manitoba and the Northwest Territory Métis, and the blue is for the Saskatchewan Métis (despite the first recorded sighting of the red flag in what is now Saskatchewan and the blue flag first being recorded in what is now Manitoba). Another explanation for the colours of the flags is depending on how the flag is being used. Some argue that the red flag is the Métis Hunting Flag, letting the people around know that they were a hunting party and not at war, and the guide for the day would be the flag-bearer. Due to the potential for skirmishes and battles on the bison hunting trips, such as the Battle of Grand Coteau, the red flag could serve as a standard. Some have also suggested that the flag started out as someone's attempt to design a flag for the Métis, and was putting out feelers to trial a design, which is why there are both red and blue flags with the common feature being the white infinity symbol. The difficulty in knowing the accurate history of the origin of the flag and potential interpretations of the symbolism is that there are no known records that accurately describe the origin of the flag in a first- hand account nor other written records of its creation.  Alternative Hypothesis on the Colours of the Flag  Prominent Métis lawyer, historian, and author, Jean Teillet, argues that the story of the origin of the Métis flag is an urban myth. Of the first three historic accounts of the Métis flag, only James Sutherland attributed the flag as a gift from the North West Company, based on rumours that he was told, and she argues that we should exercise caution in taking it as fact. Teillet argues that the Métis had a more active role in the origin of the flag, rather than being passive recipients of the flag or being manipulated by the North West Company. In 1815, popular fabrics in tradings posts that were available were calico, corduroy, plaid, and stroud. Stroud, a woollen, felt-like, broadcloth commonly used in making coats, was the only suitable material available for making flags. The common colours that were available at the time were green, red, and blue. Telliet asserts that as a matter of practicality, the Métis would have used the material that was available to them for making flags. When they needed to make a new flag, they purchased the material that was available, and if red was not available, they might have chosen to use blue instead. Rather than being a strategic ideological decision to align colours with particular trading companies, her assertion is that the colour was a reaction to what was practical in that time and location.  History  Originally, the flags that would have been flown in Rupert's Land and across the North-Western Territory were of the Hudson's Bay Company flag and North West Company flag, respectively, and the Union Jack. Métis oral tradition tells that the Métis developed the infinity flag for themselves, and called the flag Li Paviiyoon di Michif in the Michif language. Some people tell a story that Alexander Macdonell of Greenfield gifted the Métis employed by the North West Company a flag in 1814, helping to create the Métis Nation, but there are no records that directly confirm this version of events, and some that potentially contradict this story. =James Sutherland's accounts of the Métis flag= The flag was first reported by James Sutherland in 1815 as red with an infinity symbol, and that it was being flown by Cuthbert Grant at Qu'Appelle. In his account, Sutherland reported a rumour that he had heard about the origin of the flag as a gift from the North West Company given in early 1815, but provided no evidence to confirm this origin story for the flag nor did he state that it was a gift from Alexander Macdonell of Greenfield. The events reported in this account happened prior to Sutherland's arrival at Qu'Appelle on December 8, 1815, so were conveyed to him by Hudson's Bay Company Officer John Richards McKay and his party, who had arrived there in early October 1815 and had witnessed the events described. Sutherland would also describe his first time seeing the flag at the arrival of John McDonald from Swan River in early 1816, though he did not provide an additional description of the flag. Sutherland also discussed what he had been told about why the flag was flying. =Potential contradictions of James Sutherland's account of the Métis flag as a gift= However, the assertion that the flag was a gift for the Métis from Alexander Macdonell of Greenfield and the North West Company is potentially contradicted by other accounts of gifts being given to the Métis by the North West Company and people they employed, in which the accounts do not mention of the flag among other gifts being given. A potential contradiction of Sutherland's suggestion that the flag may have been a gift is found in an account of gifts being given to the Métis by the North West Company on June 28, 1815 at Fort William. The gifts, which included two swords, were given for the actions of the Métis against the Red River Colony, but there is no mention of a flag being gifted to the Métis. Colin Robertson (then employed by the Hudson's Bay Company) describes gifts being given to the Métis at Fort Gibraltar in his journal entry from September 15, 1815 at Fort Douglas, but there is no mention of a flag being given by Macdonnell among the other presents given by Duncan Cameron to the Métis for their activity against the Colony in Spring 1815 (Macdonell and Cameron had arrived at Fort Gibraltar on two days before on September 13, 1815). Further to potential contradictions of Sutherland's account of the flag being a gift is a dismissal of rumours about Duncan Cameron's gifts to the Métis and the use of the Métis as a militia of the North West Company that was written by Alexander Macdonell of Greenfield in his book A Narrative of Transactions in the Red River Country in 1819. In this book, Macdonell does not mention himself or others gifting a flag to the Métis. Macdonell also mentioned a general meeting that occurred at Fort William in 1815, but again he did not discuss a flag being given to the Métis. =Peter Fidler's accounts of the Métis flag= Peter Fidler first reported a red Métis flag with an infinity symbol around March 12, 1816 on the Qu'Appelle River, and said that it had been see the previous fall, which corroborated Sutherland's account of John McDonald's visit to Qu'Appelle. Fidler reported a rumour that he had heard that the North West Company was trying to direct the Métis to action against the Hudson's Bay Company and the newly established Red River Colony (the support was not unanimous among the Métis), but he did not attribute the flag to being a gift to the Métis. On June 1, 1816, Peter Fidler recorded in his Brandon House Journal that the Métis, under the leadership of Cuthbert Grant, were flying the blue flag with an infinity symbol when they attacked the Hudson's Bay Company's Brandon House, mere weeks before the Battle of Seven Oaks that happened on June 19, 1816. The reason for the change in the colour of the flag is not known, and Fidler did not provide information about the origin of the flag. In his narrative of the events to Lord Selkirk, Fidler did not report the changed colour, stating only that the flag was present.  Other Flags Used by the Métis  = Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia = The provisional government, the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia, established by the Métis under Louis Riel on December 8, 1869, flew a flag. There are numerous descriptions of the flag that was flown by the provisional government: * A fleur-de-lis and shamrock on a white background * A golden fleur-de-lis on a white background * A golden fleur-de-lis with a black border on a white background * A fleur-de-lis, shamrock, and small bison on the fly on a white background * Three fleur-de-lis across the top and a shamrock in the centre of the bottom edge on a white background * A fleur-de- lis and a shamrock with a large bison on the lower part on a white background * A fleur-de-lis with a small bison in one corner on a white background * A blue fleur-de-lis with a green harp and shamrock on a white background with a gold border * Three crosses: a large scarlet-coloured cross in the centre, flanked by two smaller cold crosses; on a white background with a gold border * Fleur-de-lis and shamrocks arranged around a bison on a white background. = Provisional Government of Saskatchewan = The provisional government established by Louis Riel at Batoche on March 19, 1885. A flag of the provisional government is not known, but a Métis Battle Standard was used at the Battle of Batoche. The flag was described as being a blue background, with a wolf's head and hand (palm outward) in the middle, and a banner with the Michif words \\"maisons ... autels ... Surtout Liberté\\" (literally translated, this means \\"Our Homes, the Altar, Above All Liberty\\").

It is located on the border of the Foggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods, which is a part of the Ward 2 section in Washington. It is the intersection of 23rd Street, K Street, New Hampshire Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. The through lanes of K Street (which are U.S. Route 29) travel underneath the circle in a tunnel, while the service lanes intersect the circle. History =Early- to mid-19th century= Washington Circle was first drawn on Pierre L’Enfant’s map in 1791 (Washington Circle, as well as the majority of the map, is unlabeled in L’Enfant’s original plan). Looking at L’Enfant’s Map, one can see that streets were laid in form of grids and there were many intersections around the circle. In addition to the street grids, there are a couple of other circles beside the circle. These features indicate the strategic positioning of the circle within the city. The circle intersects four major roads. On the northeastern side of the circle there’s a vista along New Hampshire Avenue that leads to DuPont Circle while on the southeastern side, there is another pleasant vista from Pennsylvania avenue that leads to the White house. The circle also intersects 23rd and K streets. In 1850, Washington Circle and its surroundings were gradually developing. Looking at the 1850 map of Washington Circle, one can see that both New Hampshire Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue were more pronounced on the map than they were in L’Enfant’s map. This shows that the two avenues were well paved in 1850. Although the avenues were developing, 23RD and K Streets were yet to be properly developed. Also the Washington Circle, itself, was very bland during this period, it had not been beautified and was known as a dangerous part of the city. The 1851 map shows that K Street, known as the area’s broadest thoroughfare also became paved. The map also illustrates the development of the circle’s surrounding with over thirty-three buildings between the New Hampshire and Pennsylvania intersection. Carefully observing the 1852 map, one can infer that not much had changed from the previous year’s map. The growth of Washington Circle was indeed a very slow one and this may be, because of the unwillingness of the congress to back up the development of the city. =Civil War era= The American Civil War was fought from 1861 to 1865 and Washington Circle was an instrumental location for the Union Army during the war. In 1862, streetcars tracks were laid around Washington Circle, but were not properly maintained during the turbulent years of the Civil War. Track improvements were made during the 1870s and the park was redesigned in 1885. These tracks were used to transport war weapons and machineries for war efforts. Also the south of the circle along 23rd street was used as a Union army encampment, named Camp Fry. Camp Fry served as a camp for wounded soldiers to recuperate. After the civil war, the camp was dismantled. St. Paul’s Episcopal church, popularly known as Old St. Paul’s Church was built in 1866 and was the first church built around the circle at the corner of 23rd street. With the influx of the African American population after the civil war, the church was built to act as a form of missionary to the people. St. Ann’s Infant Asylum was also present during the 1860s and it occupied the building that the British Legation once occupied. =Present day= Washington Circle's park In the 1892 map of Washington Circle, one can see the detailed structure of buildings present then. The majority of the buildings present during this period were built with stone. Between New Hampshire Avenue and K Street, most of the buildings were built with brick. There were very few green houses and most buildings served as stables or sheds. The neighborhood around Washington Circle changed during the 20th century with the relocation of the George Washington University to the Foggy Bottom campus. Foggy Bottom (including the area surrounding Washington Circle) was meant to be a residential area. With the new presence of the George Washington University which was brought on during the twentieth century, the area became much more institutionalized as seen through the George Washington University Hospital, located on the southeast end of the park. Neighborhood The Foggy Bottom campus of The George Washington University (GWU) adjoins Washington Circle. GWU's Square 54 complex is located directly south of the circle, near The George Washington University Hospital. The closest Washington Metro station is Foggy Bottom–GWU. Sculpture of George Washington Sculpture of George Washington by Clark Mills A bronze equestrian statue, sculpted by Clark Mills and depicting George Washington riding his horse during the Battle of Princeton, was installed in the center of the circle on February 22, 1860. The Continental Congress voted to build the statue in George Washington’s honor in 1783 but the statue was not commissioned until 1853 at a total cost of $60,000. Mills depicted General Washington in the heroic, idealized Romantic style, reminiscent of Jacques-Louis David's painting Napoleon Crossing the Alps. Washington's horse was modeled on a wild horse that was captured on the plains of Kansas. The National Park Service now maintains Washington Circle's park, the public space surrounding Washington's statue.

In geometry, the isogonal conjugate of a point P with respect to a triangle ABC is constructed by reflecting the lines PA, PB, and PC about the angle bisectors of A, B, and C respectively. These three reflected lines concur at the isogonal conjugate of P. (This definition applies only to points not on a sideline of triangle ABC.) This is a direct result of the trigonometric form of Ceva's theorem. The isogonal conjugate of a point P is sometimes denoted by P*. The isogonal conjugate of P* is P. The isogonal conjugate of the incentre I is itself. The isogonal conjugate of the orthocentre H is the circumcentre O. The isogonal conjugate of the centroid G is (by definition) the symmedian point K. The isogonal conjugates of the Fermat points are the isodynamic points and vice versa. The Brocard points are isogonal conjugates of each other. In trilinear coordinates, if X = x : y : z is a point not on a sideline of triangle ABC, then its isogonal conjugate is 1/x : 1/y : 1/z. For this reason, the isogonal conjugate of X is sometimes denoted by X −1. The set S of triangle centers under trilinear product, defined by : (p : q : r) * (u : v : w) = pu : qv : rw, is a commutative group, and the inverse of each X in S is X −1. As isogonal conjugation is a function, it makes sense to speak of the isogonal conjugate of sets of points, such as lines and circles. For example, the isogonal conjugate of a line is a circumconic; specifically, an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola according as the line intersects the circumcircle in 0, 1, or 2 points. The isogonal conjugate of the circumcircle is the line at infinity. Several well-known cubics (e.g., Thompson cubic, Darboux cubic, Neuberg cubic) are self-isogonal-conjugate, in the sense that if X is on the cubic, then X −1 is also on the cubic.

They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (Prionotus carolinus) and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. They are bottom-dwelling fish, living down to , although they can be found in much shallower water. Most species are around in length. They have an unusually solid skull, and many species also possess armored plates on their bodies. Another distinctive feature is the presence of a \\"drumming muscle\\" that makes sounds by beating against the swim bladder. When caught, they make a croaking noise similar to a frog, which has given them the onomatopoeic name gurnard. Sea robins have six spiny \\"legs\\", three on each side. These legs are actually flexible spines that were once part of the pectoral fin. During development, the spines separate from the rest of the fin, developing into feeler-like \\"forelegs\\".Kuntz, A., and L. Radcliffe (1918) Notes on the embryology and larval development of twelve teleostean fishes. Bull. U.S. Bur. Fish. 35(1915- 1916):87-134. The pectoral fins can be used to walk on the sea floor as well as to explore the bottom in search of food. The first three rays of the pectoral fins are membrane-free and used for chemoreception being highly sensitive to amino acids prevalent in marine invertebrates.Bardach, J. & Case, J.

As food  Gurnard have firm white flesh that holds together well in cooking, making them well-suited to soups and stews. They were often caught in British waters as a bycatch and discarded. However, as other species became less sustainable and more expensive, , gurnards were becoming more popular in Britain, and the wholesale price between 2007 and 2008 was reported to have increased from £0.25 per kg to £4. Sea robins also are now appearing in fish markets in the U.S. One source says that gurnards are rather bony and lacking in flavour, and usually sold quite cheaply; others praise its flavour and texture. The flesh of this fish is commonly used in the French dish bouillabaisse.  Angling  Sea robins can be caught by dropping a variety of baits and lures to the seafloor, where they actively feed. Mackerel is believed to be the most efficient bait for catching sea robins, but crabs, bunker and other fish meat can also be used successfully depending on location. Sea robins can also be caught by lure fishing if lured near the substrate. They are often considered to be rough fish, caught when fishing for more desirable fish such as striped bass or flounder. Gurnard are also used as bait, for example by lobster fishermen.

The museum was founded in 1867, and was one of the first museums west of the Mississippi River. It houses 160,000 historical artifacts and specimens and a giant screen theater. It is located at 1717 West 12th Street, at the corner of Division and West 12th Street on \\"museum hill,\\" near Fejervary Park. History The Davenport Academy of Natural Sciences was started in 1867 on Brady Street as one of the earliest museums in the West. The Charles E. and Mary Louisa Duncan Putnam family of Davenport was an early strong supporter started base on their son's, Joseph Duncan, interest in insects. Later, the academy was renamed after the Putnam family. Also, the museum moved in 1964 to 1717 West 12th Street in Davenport, its current site. Starting in 1997, the museum was losing money on operations and began to use its endowment to make up the short fall. In 2002, the museum opened an Imax theater at a cost of $14.5 million for which the board of directors took out a loan. The theater was a money maker for the institute, while its debt added to its losses. Soon its development director position went vacant in December 2005; followed by the executive director, Chris Reich, left in January 2006. Mark Bawden became the interim director and raised enough funds by April 2007 to retire the Imax debt. He then stepped down to the development director post, while On May 15, 2007 Kim Findlay started as the new executive director. Bawden the started a campaign to replenish the endowments. The Putnam Museum removed its IMAX system for twin DLP projectors in June 2012, then affiliated with National Geographic Cinema Ventures' Museum Partnership Program.  Exhibits  Black Earth, Big River is an exploration of the past and present habitats of the Quad-Cities region. Black Earth, Big River, the newest permanent exhibit in the museum features a 718-gallon aquarium filled with river fish, a cave, and a huge oak tree. Habitats and wildlife are explained throughout the exhibit, along with stories of the region. Hall of Mammals explains various mammals through many means. Photographs, hands-on activities, and realistic dioramas are all provided in this multi-sensory exhibit. From the Arctic polar bears to the African zebras, many different animals are explored in this exhibit. National Geographic Giant Screen Theater The theater has one of the largest movie screens in the state of Iowa, 57' by 70'. In 2002, the museum opened an Imax theater at a cost of $14.5 million for which the board of directors took out a loan. The theater was a money maker for the institute, while its debt added to its losses. They then associated with IMAX large screen theater corporation as Putnam Museum and IMAX Theatre. The Putnam Museum removed its IMAX system for twin DLP projectors renaming the theater to Putnam Giant Screen Theater in June 2012. Then affiliated with National Geographic Cinema Ventures's Museum Partnership Program as \\"National Geographic Giant Screen Theater\\" in June 2012. The partnership with National Geographic allows the Putnam access to one of the world's largest Giant-Screen film libraries in 2D and 3D digital formats.

He dedicated the sonata to Prince Karl von Lichnowsky, who had been his patron since 1792. Consisting of four movements, the sonata takes around 20–22 minutes to perform.  Structure  The structure of the sonata is unconventional in that the piece opens with a relatively slow movement in the format of theme and variations. The third movement incorporates a funeral march, clearly anticipating the watershed of the Eroica Symphony that Beethoven wrote in 1803–1804. This is the only movement from his sonatas that Beethoven arranged for orchestra, and was played during Beethoven's own funeral procession in 1827. This sonata is also unusual in that none of its four movements is in sonata-allegro form. In most of Beethoven's four-movement sonatas, the third movement is in and in ternary form, while the second movement is slow and in a different key from the other movements. In this sonata, the second and third movements have switched roles, where the second movement is the ternary scherzo and trio, while the third movement is the slow movement in the tonic minor. = First movement = :650px The movement consists of a theme by Beethoven and five variations. The third variation has been called a \\"pre-echo\\" of the funeral march movement by Andras Schiff during his lecture on the sonata. This movement is also unusual in the sense that it is not in sonata form but rather a set of variations on a theme. = Second movement = :700px = Third movement = :700px In some editions there are no tempo markings, just \\"Marcia Funebre, sulla morte d'un Eroe\\" (\\"Funeral March, relating to the death of a hero\\") Beethoven transcribed this movement for orchestra as part of a suite of incidental music to Johann Duncker's play Leonore Prohaska, bearing the catalog number WoO 96. = Fourth movement = :700px Influences The main theme of Schubert's Impromptu in A major, Op. 142 No. 2 is strikingly similar to the theme in the first movement of Beethoven's sonata. The four-bar phrases that open these pieces are almost identical in most musical aspects: key, harmony, voicing, register, and basic as well as harmonic rhythm. Another less immediate connection exists with the main theme, also in A major, of the Adagio movement in Schubert's piano sonata in C minor, D. 958. Indeed, Schubert may have borrowed these themes from Beethoven, as he often did in his compositions. This sonata was greatly admired by Chopin, who repeated its basic sequence of scherzo, funeral march with trio, and perpetuum mobile finale in his own Piano Sonata in B minor. His first movement, however, is also animated and in sonata form, unlike Beethoven's Andante con variazioni.

Helen Wells (1910-1986) wrote volumes #1-7 and 17-27, and Julie Campbell Tatham (1908-1999), the creator of Trixie Belden, wrote volumes #8-16. Wells also created the Vicki Barr series. During World War II, the series encouraged girls to become nurses as a way to aid the war effort.\\"Cherry Ames, War Nurse.\\" Cherry Ames original editions are prized by collectors and fans. The series generated a few spin-off items, including a Parker Brothers board game; some titles have been reprinted. Character The series stars a job-hopping, mystery-solving nurse in the Nancy Drew mold, named Cherry Ames. Cherry (short for Charity) hails from Hilton, Illinois (based on Wells' hometown of Danville, Illinois), and was steered into nursing by Dr. Joseph Fortune, an old family friend. Cherry's training at the Spencer Hospital School of Nursing is chronicled in the first two books. There, she meets the classmates who become lifelong friends. With the third book in the series Army Nurse, Cherry joins the Army Nurse Corps, and, after the war, she moves to Greenwich Village. Whenever Cherry isn't working with the Visiting Nurse Service, Dr. Joe sends her on assignments in various parts of the country. Unlike other nurses of girls' fiction, such as Sue Barton, Cherry remains unpartnered throughout her career, although an occasional beau will crop up, such as Dr. \\"Lex\\" Upham. =Evolution of character= Cherry's early adventures are set during World War II. In these early adventures, Cherry solves problems and captures criminals when men in authority have failed to do so, \\"demonstrating that women can succeed in the public, working world.\\"Inness (1998), 250.

Girls' series books follow a girl in her late teens or early twenties, usually with an interesting job, who goes on adventures either on her own or with a small group of friends. The genre was occasionally criticized for its formulaic plots and the poor construction of the books themselves. Beginning in 2005, the Cherry Ames series was licensed to the Springer Publishing Company and are currently being re-printed.

It is separated from the island of Newfoundland by Baccalieu Tickle, a small strait and an abundant fishing ground. The island has some trees but mostly rocky. The name Baccalieu is derived either from the Portuguese bacalhau, Spanish bacalao or the Basque baccalos, all meaning \\"codfish\\". Early Portuguese maps dating before Columbus' voyage indicate an island west of the Azores named Terra do Bacalhau which may have been the whole island of Newfoundland.

The island supports the largest known colony of Leach's storm-petrel in the world, approximately 40% of the global population and about 70% of the western Atlantic population of this species. It is a nesting area for 11 breeding species: * Atlantic puffin (45,000 pairs - approximately 12% of the eastern North America population) * Black-legged kittiwake (13,000 - approximately 5 to 7% of the western Atlantic breeding population); and * Northern gannet (677 pairs - approximately 1.5% of the North American population). * Northern fulmar * Black guillemot * Common murre * Thick-billed murre * Razorbill * Herring gull * Great black-backed gull * The island also includes one of the largest winter populations of eider in Newfoundland.

Gaster stated in his extensive preface his view (p. xx) that the Chronicles were compiled from several Hebrew sources, some quite ancient and others more recent. The actual compiler of the chronicles identifies himself as \\"Eleasar ben Asher the Levite\\" who, according to Gaster, lived in the Rhineland in the 14th century. The most recent events depicted in the Chronicles refer to the time of the Crusades, but the entire rest of it pertains to the period before AD 70. Among the early sources quoted in the work is the 1st century Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus. Gaster explained that he chose to title it \\"Chronicles of Jerahmeel\\" instead of \\"Chronicles of Eleasar\\" because of his analysis that Eleasar was merely a compiler, while the enigmatic \\"Jeraḥmeel\\" is the source most extensively reproduced, following the Yosippon which is otherwise extant. This 'Jerahmeel' has since been identified as Jerahmeel ben Solomon, thought to have flourished in Italy around 1150. After a thorough discussion of all the textual evidence, Gaster further concluded that, like the closely related Sefer haYashar, it relies on sources ultimately dependent on Isidore of Seville, particularly evident in its mention of \\"Franks\\" and \\"Lombards\\" among the Sons of Noah.

Samuel Danks Waddy (27 June 1830 – 30 December 1902) was an English politician. He was born in Gateshead, the son of Samuel Dousland Waddy, a Methodist minister. The family soon moved to Sheffield and his father was instrumental in the founding of Wesley College in 1838 (and was Governor of the school from 1844 to 1862). Samuel Danks Waddy attended Wesley College himself and was the first pupil to be registered in 1838. He was elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnstaple, Devon on 3 February 1874 but resigned this seat in December 1879 to stand in a by-election in the Sheffield constituency, taking the seat on 21 December 1879. However he held the Sheffield seat for less than four months, being voted out by just 40 votes on 3 April 1880. He was elected as MP for Edinburgh in 1882, and when that seat was abolished, he contested, but lost, the new Islington North seat at the 1885 general election. On 7 July 1886, at the 1886 general election, he was elected as M.P. for the Brigg constituency in Lincolnshire. He held the seat until 1894 when he was appointed Recorder of Sheffield. He kept this position until he resigned shortly before his death, in late 1902. In 1896 he was appointed as Judge of the Cheshire County Court but only held the position for two weeks, transferring to be Judge of the Sheffield County Court on 24 April 1896.

Born in Melbourne, Australia, Villiers first went to sea at age 15 and sailed on board traditionally rigged vessels, including the full-rigged ship Joseph Conrad. He commanded square-rigged ships for films, including Moby Dick and Billy Budd. He also commanded the Mayflower II on its voyage from the United Kingdom to the United States. Villiers wrote 44 books, and served as the Chairman (1960–70) and President (1970-74) of the Society for Nautical Research, a Trustee of the National Maritime Museum, and Governor of the Cutty Sark Preservation Society. He was awarded the British Distinguished Service Cross as a Commander in the Royal Naval Reserve during the Second World War. Early history Alan John Villiers was the second son of Australian poet and union leader Leon Joseph Villiers. The young Villiers grew up on the docks watching the merchant ships come in and out of the Port of Melbourne and longed for the day on which he too could sail out to sea. Leaving home at the age of 15, he joined the barque Rothesay Bay as an apprentice. The Rothesay Bay operated in the Tasman Sea, trading between Australia and New Zealand. Villiers was a natural seaman. He learned quickly and gained the respect of his shipmates. An accident on board the barque Lawhill beached Villiers in 1922, by then a seasoned Able seaman. He sought employment as a journalist at the Hobart Mercury newspaper in Tasmania while he recovered from his wounds. Writer and adventurer The call of the sea was strong, and soon Villiers was back at sea when the great explorer and whaler Carl Anton Larsen and his whaling factory ship, the Sir James Clark Ross came to port with five whale chasers in tow in late 1923. His accounts of the trip would eventually be published as Whaling in the Frozen South. Named for the Antarctica explorer James Clark Ross, the Ross was the largest whale factory ship in the world, weighing in at 12,000 tons. She was headed for the southern Ross Sea, the last whale stronghold left. Villiers writes: \\"We had caught 228, most of them blues, the biggest over 100 feet long. These yielded 17,000 barrels of oil; we had hoped for at least 40,000, with luck 60,000.\\" Villiers' passage on board the Herzogin Cecilie in 1927 would result in his publication of Falmouth for Orders. Through it he met Captain Ruben de Cloux, who later became his partner in the barque Parma. He wrote By Way of Cape Horn after his harrowing experiences on board the Grace Harwar in 1929. The full-rigged ship Grace Harwar was beautiful as the \\"wind in her rigging called imperiously as she lay at the pier at Wallaroo\\". As Villiers stood on the dock, a wharf laborer warned \\"Don't ship out in her! She's a killer.\\" The warning would prove true, as Villiers' friend Ronald Walker was lost by the time Grace Harwar made Ireland. More than 40 years old at the time, the ship had barnacles and algae growing along her waterline. \\"Dirty bottoms make slow ships, and slow ships make hard passages.\\" Villiers had a desire to document the great sailing ships before it was too late, and Grace was one of the last working full-riggers. With a small ill-paid crew and no need for coal, such vessels undercut steam ships, and maybe 20 ships were still involved in the trade. The ill-fated voyage took 138 days, the Grace the last of the fleet for the year. The voyage was filmed in both movie (6,000 feet) and still form, serving as a record of significant images of that period. Ship owner and circumnavigator Villiers reunited with Ruben de Cloux in 1931, becoming a partner with him in the four- masted barque Parma. With de Cloux as captain, Parma won the unofficial \\"grain race\\" between the ships of the trade in 1932, arriving in 103 days despite broaching in a gale. In 1933, the ship won in 83 days. Villiers sailed as a passenger on both voyages.Lance, Kate Alan Villiers: Voyager of the Winds National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London (2009) . After selling his shares back to de Cloux, Villiers purchased the Georg Stage in 1934. A full rigged sailing ship of 400 tons, originally built in 1882 by Burmeister & Wain in Copenhagen, Denmark, she was employed as a sailing school ship by Stiftelsen Georg Stages Minde. Saving her from the scrapyard, Villiers renamed her the Joseph Conrad, after the author of The Nigger of the 'Narcissus', Typhoon, and The Shadow-Line, who was also an accomplished seaman. A sail training pioneer, Villiers circumnavigated the globe with an amateur crew. He used the unique environment of the sea to build character and discipline in his young crew and, with his contemporaries Irving and Exy Johnson, he helped form the modern concept of sail training. It is used not to teach youth for a life at sea, but to use the sea to teach youth for life. Returning almost two years later, Villiers sold the Joseph Conrad to George Huntington Hartford. He published two books of his adventures, Cruise of the \\"Conrad\\" and Stormalong. The Joseph Conrad is maintained and operated as a museum ship at Mystic Seaport in Connecticut, USA, where she continues to educate the youth of today in the rich history of the age of sail. In 1938 Alan Villiers embarked as a passenger on an Arab dhow for a round trip from Oman to the Rufiji delta, and depicted the way of life of Arab sailors and their navigation techniques in a book called Sons of Sindbad, illustrated with his own photographs. World War II A LCI(L) during the Invasion of Sicily - 1943 With the outbreak of World War II, Villiers was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve in 1940. He was assigned to a convoy of 24 LCI(L)'s, or Landing craft, Infantry (Large). Ordered to deliver them across the Atlantic, with a 40 percent loss rate expected, Villiers got all but one safely across. He commanded \\"flights\\" of LCI(L)'s on D-Day in the Battle of Normandy, the Invasion of Sicily, and the Burma Campaign in the Far East. By the end of the War, Villiers had been promoted to Commander and awarded the British Distinguished Service Cross. Later years Married in 1940 to his second wife Nancie, Villiers settled in Oxford, England, and continued to be active in sailing and writing. He was the Captain of the Mayflower II in her 1957 maiden voyage across the Atlantic, 337 years after the original Mayflower, and beating her predecessor's time of 67 days by 13 days. He was involved in almost every large Age of Sail ship then still in existence , including the Balclutha, the USCGC Eagle, the Falls of Clyde, the Gazela, the Sagres, and would also prove instrumental in the restoration of the Star of India. From 1963-67 he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to build a replica of HM Bark Endeavour. He advised on the 1962 MGM movie Mutiny on the Bounty. Villiers was a regular contributor to the National Geographic Magazine throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Villiers produced a travel lecture film, Last of the Great Sea Dogs, which ran at the Dorothy Chandler pavilion in 1976. The film contains 16mm color, filmography of his adventures. There is a digital restored master of the performance with an audio track, narrated by Villiers. In 1951, the Portuguese ambassador to the United States, Pedro Teotónio Pereira, a sailing enthusiast and later a close friend of Villiers, invited him to sail on the schooner Argus, a cod fishing four-masted schooner, and to record the last commercial activity ever to make use of sails in ocean-crossings. Villiers wrote \\"The Quest Of The Schooner Argus: A voyage to the Grand Banks and Greenland on a modern four masted fishing schooner\\".Publisher: Charles Scribner's Sons; First American Edition (January 19, 1951) The book was a great success in North America and Europe and was later published in sixteen languages. The voyage made news on the BBC, in the main London newspapers, the National Geographic Magazine, and the New York Times, and the Portuguese government made Villiers a Commendador of the Portuguese Order of St. James of the Sword for outstanding services to literature in March 1951. In 1978, Villiers weighed in that Francis Drake landed at New Albion at Point Reyes in Marin County, California. In 2010, the Society for Nautical Research, the Naval Review, and the Britannia Naval Research Association jointly established the annual Alan Villiers Memorial Lecture at St Edmund Hall, Oxford.  In popular culture  Civilization VI includes a quote from Villiers: “There is little man has made that approaches anything in nature, but a sailing ship does.” References Bibliography =Books= *Whaling In The Frozen South (1925 The Bobbs-Merrill co.) *The Wind Ship (1928) Hurst & Blackett, Ltd.) *Falmouth for Orders (1929 Henry Holt and Company) *By way of Cape Horn (1930 Henry Holt and Co); illustrated with photographs taken by Ronald Gregory Walker and the author *Sea Dogs of Today (1931 Henry Holt & Company) *Vanished Fleets (1931 Charles Scribner's Sons, ) *The Sea in Ships (1932 G.

Fell  Life and work  Fell was born in rural southeastern Chester County, Pennsylvania, to Quaker parents of modest means, Rebecca (Roman) and Jesse Fell. He attended local Friends schools as well as a private boy's academy and briefly taught in local public schools before migrating to Ohio to study law in 1828. In 1831 Fell moved to Illinois, opening Bloomington's first law offices and beginning his career in real estate. Fell was especially active during the Illinois land boom in the late 1830s; with James Allin, Fell co-founded the town of Clinton, Illinois and worked to create DeWitt County arranging for his brother, Kersey H. Fell, to become the clerk responsible for organizing the new county. He established Livingston County, which he named, and backed the founders of Pontiac, Illinois, which he also named. Fell invested in lands in Bloomington, Chicago, Milwaukee, Danville, and other places in central and eastern Illinois.Frances Milton Moorehouse, The Life of Jesse W. Fell (Urbana: University of Illinois, 1916) pp 1-29. Fell also founded Bloomington's first newspaper, The Bloomington Observer and McLean County Advocate in 1837 and, after several years running a fruit orchard in Adams County, returned to McLean County and work as an agent for the former Alton & Springfield Railroad to secure the right of way through McLean County. He helped found the town of Towanda and with his brother founded the town of Dwight.Moorehouse, 1916, p.32. and later defeated an effort to have the railroad bypass his extensive land holdings in Pontiac.History of Livingston County Illinois (Chicago: LeBaron, 1878) p. 326. He sold lots in Decatur, Lexington, Clinton, El Paso, Joliet, and LeRoy and in 1855 he purchased timber land and began operation a sawmill near Ullin in southern Illinois.Moorehouse, 1916, p.33. In 1854 Fell arranged for the Chicago and Mississippi Railroad to cross the Illinois Central Railroad north of Bloomington where he had founded the town of North Bloomington. In 1860, Illinois State Normal University relocated there from a site in downtown Bloomington, resulting in the town being renamed Normal in 1865. Fell was an enthusiastic arborist who developed an extensive park around his home, and was known for planting trees in his real estate holdings.Moorehouse, 1916, pp. 106-11.  Death  Fell died at his home in Normal, Illinois on February 25, 1887. The Normal Town Council declared that through his \\"untiring and disinterested efforts\\" he had secured the crossing of the two railroads and they passed a resolution stating that, \\"Normal without Jesse Fell is comparatively like a family without a father.\\"William D.

Legacy  * Many place names in Normal reflect Jesse W. Fell. Fell Park in Normal is located on land he set aside for public use in the 1850s.Fell Park There is also a Fell Avenue extending from Bloomington to Normal. Hester Street in Normal is named for his wife Hester Brown Fell. Fort Jesse Road in Normal takes its name from the nickname given by the Fell family to their isolated rural home during the early years in Illinois. *Co-founded, along with James Allin, the city of Clinton, Illinois. With Charles W. Holder he co-founded the town of Towanda, Illinois. He was one of five men who founded Dwight, Illinois. He was deeply involved with the founding of Pontiac, Illinois and in the creation of Livingston County, Illinois. Fell Park in Pontiac is named in his honor. *Illinois State University has an aboreteum covering its main quadrangle known as the Fell Arboretum (in Jesse W. Fell's honour). The University also has a Fell Hall housing the Department of Communication named for Fell. *Fell's granddaughter married Lewis Stevenson, making him an ancestor of the Illinois political family, including Democratic presidential candidate Adlai E.

Fell (10 November 1808 – 25 February 1887) and Charles W. Holder (25 September 1819 – 10 April 1900). * He helped organize the Free Congregational Church in Bloomington, a member of the [American Unitarian Association], now called the Unitarian Universalist Church of Bloomington-Normal. He was nationally known for his love of trees. Holder was a partner in many of Fell's projects...In the summer of 1869 Fell traveled to northwestern Iowa and selected a tract of about forty sections, more than 25,000 acres (100 km2) of land. Fell wrote, \\"I have never beheld such a large body of surpassingly beautiful prairie as is here to be found. There is absolutely no waste of land, and scarce a quarter of a section not affording an admirable building site.\\" Holder then entered the land. Larchwood was established at the center of their holdings. Fell frequently visited the site and in May 0f 1873 personally supervised the planting of some 100,000 saplings and tree cuttings. The town did not grow as rapidly as expected and in 1881 the development was sold to an Englishman Richard Sykes. There still is a small grove of larchwood trees growing in the Larchwood park. Larchwood has a Fell Street.  References   External links  * * Life of Jesse Fell * Role with Lincoln Bio * Lincoln Autobiography written for Jesse Fell *Jesse W.

The grunt sculpin generally remains close to shore and is often found in empty giant barnacle shells. It was first identified by Albert Günther in 1874 and was named in honor of naturalist John Richardson. The common name comes from reports that the fish vibrate or \\"grunt\\" when held. Its defining feature is its tendency to “hop” along the ocean floor on its orange fins. The short, stout body of the grunt sculpin has a long, small mouth which is adapted for eating smaller prey.  Taxonomy  It is a member of the class Actinopterygii, the ray-finned fishes. It is further classified into the order Scorpaeniformes, commonly known as the mail- cheeked fishes. The superfamily Cottoidea which is classified within this order includes R. richardsonii and all other sculpins. However, the grunt sculpin is the only member of the family Rhamphocottidae. Its name comes from “rhamp” meaning snout and “cottus” meaning sculpin based on its physical characteristics. The second part of its name is in honor of the naturalist John Richardson.  Description  The largest recorded length for the grunt sculpin is only 8.9 cm. Its main features are its big head, short, stout body, long pig snout, and orange fins. The body is usually a yellow color with brown stripes contrasted by its very orange pectoral fins. Compared to other sculpins, it has a small mouth with a longer snout affecting its feeding habits. Although it can swim in an abnormal manner with its head pointing up, it mainly “hops” along the bottom of the ocean using its several pectoral fins. It’s phenotypically classified by its pectoral fins being separated from the upper lobe, the presence of anal and dorsal fin stays, and its hypural- parhypural bone being made of a singular piece.  Distribution and Habitat  The grunt sculpin is found around the coasts in the eastern Pacific Ocean, stretching from southern California to the Bering Sea, although it has also been seen off of the coast of Japan. In these regions, the grunt sculpin resides in a variety of habitats such as rocky shores, kelp forest, sandy beaches, and coral reefs. In these habitats, it generally remains in shallower waters (as shallow as two meters) but it has been found at depths of 165 meters. It prefers to shelter in empty giant barnacles, but it will also live in debris under piers and floats in the absence of giant barnacles. Within the barnacles, the grunt sculpin will stick out its fins and wave them around to try to mimic the appearance and movement of the cirri of a living barnacle.  Diet  The grunt sculpin has a small mouth for a sculpin, therefore it mainly preys on small crustaceans but sometimes small fishes and worms as well. Their main predators are rockcod and other carnivorous fishes. Classifying whether R. richardsonii are ram or suction feeders is difficult as it has physical features of both types and it feeds on both prey types (elusive and grasping) with similar success, though it fares better with smaller elusive prey. Ram feeders envelop the prey with a quick movement of their body while suction feeders use negative pressure to draw water and prey into their mouths. Elusive prey are prey that can initiate evasive maneuvers while grasping prey tend to hold onto the substrate to avoid being eaten. R. richarsonii tend to attack with lower velocities and from shorter distances (less than half its body length away) in comparison to other Cottidae fishes.  Reproduction  Spawning generally occurs at the rocky shores from August to October. The female is the dominant mate in reproduction and will chase and trap the male within a rocky crevice until she has laid all her eggs (about 150). The eggs will hatch 16–20 weeks after fertilization depending on the temperature conditions. Larvae forms have been reported from March to June. The larvae must remain near the shore as that is the habitat in which the grunt sculpin can survive. If the larva is lost to planktonic dispersal in the open ocean then the fish is unlikely to survive. How the larvae are adapted and influenced by environmental factors to remain close to shore is unclear.Grunt Sculpin.

The game is an absurdly complex Poker variant, with the same basic rules as stud poker but with different names for the suits and face cards and the added concept of conditional modifiers. A conditional modifier is a modification to the rules based on variables such as the day of the week, the number of players, chair position, which hand of the game it is, etc. As a result, the game quickly gets ridiculously complicated. Asprin has never provided the full rules for Dragon Poker; it is used in the book only as a plot device in a parody of professional gambling, and not as a fully developed game. This has not stopped fans from creating a set of Rules For Dragon Poker.See example rulesets published include Bob Galley's and Card Games Online: https://sites.google.com/site/rulesofdragonpoker/home The deck Dragon Poker is played with a standard 52-card deck with the usual four suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. However, the Dragon Poker deck's face cards are Elves, Ogres, Unicorns, and Dragons, corresponding to jacks, queens, kings, and aces, respectively. (Like aces in poker, Dragons can be either the high card or the low card in a straight, but not both.) The deal Dragon Poker is a kind of stud poker. That is, each player plays the cards he gets, with no chance to draw better cards. Unlike most poker variations, the scoring hands are made up of six cards rather than five, and a total of nine cards are dealt to each player. Thus, a total of five players can play for each deck. The game is played with all cards on the table, with four face-down hole cards and five cards face up. The hole cards are the first three and the last one to each player. (Down - down - down - up - up - up - up - up - down). Hands With six-card hands, the variations of possible hands are far more numerous than in standard poker. Thus, the standard order does not necessarily apply. The hands, with descriptions, from lowest to highest: *High card: Same as in normal poker *One Pair: Same as in normal poker *Two Pair: Same as in normal poker *Three of a Kind: Same as in normal poker *Three Pair: Just what it sounds like *Full house: Same as in normal poker, a \\"Three of a Kind\\" plus a \\"Pair\\" *Straight: Six cards with consecutive face values, of any suits (see below) *Four of a Kind: Same as in normal poker *Corps-a-corps: see below *Flush: Six cards of the same suit, with any values *Full Belly: Two sets of \\"Three of a Kind\\" *Full Dragon: A \\"Four of a Kind\\" plus a \\"Pair\\" *Straight Flush: Six cards of the same suit, with consecutive face values A few hands require some explanation: Normal hands -- One and two pairs, three of a kind, full house, and four of a kind are exactly the same as in five-card poker, with an extra, \\"don't care\\" card. Flushes, straights, and straight flushes are similar to their counterparts, but that the sixth card must fit with the same rule as the other five. Added hands -- Three pairs is as it would seem: three pairs of cards put together. A full belly is two sets of threes of a kind, and a full dragon is a four of a kind plus a pair. *Note: The position for straights is out of order in regards to the list given in Little Myth Marker. This is because the number of possible straights is higher than that of flushes and fours of a kind. The Corps-a-Corps hand -- The \\"corps-a-corps\\" hand was given no official definition in the book Little Myth Marker. Betting Dragon Poker has six rounds of betting: once after each round of up cards is dealt (the fourth through eighth), plus a final betting round before everyone shows their hole cards. As in traditional poker, the person who starts each round is the one with the best hand \\"showing\\", that is, from just all the face-up cards. Conditional modifiers What makes Dragon Poker so intriguing (and confusing) is the concept of conditional modifiers. These are a standard set of rules that, depending on the day, weather, number of people playing, and other factors, determines what cards are wild, what cards are \\"dead\\" (unusable), and other subtle changes in how the game is played. In the books, the rules delineating conditional modifiers vary as well, depending on the dimension where the game is being played. It is not known if there exists a set or rules for modifiers that applies to Earth's dimension, nor, if they exist, what they are. If a player makes a mistake in his interpretation of the current hand's conditional modifiers, so that he undervalues his own hand, the opponent is not required to point out the error (although he is not forbidden from doing so, either). A few of the modifiers mentioned in Little Myth Marker: *Red dragons are wild on even-numbered hands. *Once a night, a player can change the suit of one of his cards. *Every five hands, the sequence of cards is reversed, so the low cards are high and vice versa. *Once a four-of-a-kind is played, that card value is dead and treated as a blank card. *If there's a ten showing in the first two face-up cards in each hand, then sevens will be dead (Unless there is a second ten showing, then it cancels the first). *If the first card turned face up in a round is an Ogre, the round will be played with an extra hole card, four face up and five face down.

One sign of Sohawa is the toll plaza by the name of 'Tarakki' on the Grand Trunk Road. The main bazaar of Sohawa attracts people from nearby villages.  Union Councils  SohawaTehsil is subdivided into 9 Union Councils: Adrana, Domeli, Jajial, Kohali, Lehri, Nagial, Pail Bane Khan, Phulrey Sydan, Pind Matay Khan, and Sohawa.  History  The Etymology of the name Sohawa has not been proven, yet, according to folk etymologies, the original name was Soo Awa which means '100 fences of potters'. Originally a small village near Khoraka, Soahwa merged with Khoraka after several years of human settlement. The original village is part of the main town (Khoraka) and is called \\"Ward #1\\" or Purana Sohawa (literally \\"old Sohawa\\").  Demographics  The most famous village is Kot Dhamiak (Fort of Dhamials), which has existed since the time of Sultan Raja Dhami Khan. It was a fort at the time when Shahab Din conquered this area in the 16th century, as well as being the place where Shehab-ud-din Ghori was murdered by Khokhars.(according to, Allan (1900), p. 210, Imperial Gazetteers Of India.census of India 1901) The village named Bishindaur which was changed to Dewan-e-Hazoori by Mian Mohammad Nawaz Shareef at the request of Majlis-e-Qadria Dewan-e-Hazoori is located about 5 miles from Sohawa. Bishandour was named after Bishan Singh who ruled the area and was the grandson of Raja Ram Singh who was the ruler of Amber, and head of the Kachwaha Rajput clan, from 1688 to 1699. Bishandour village is named after the great saint Dewan-e-Hazoori. Today, a big market in the village is where most of the community do their shopping. Dewan e Hazoori was the biggest food market of Sohawa before partition. Dewan e Hazoori has an annual religious event for the birth of the Wali Haji Hafiz Syed Muhammed Abdullah, commonly known as Dewan E Hazoori. There are a darbar and a mosque at the heart of the village, where people flock to every Thursday to visit and pay their respects. Dewan-e-Hazoori Educational Complex is also a place to visit in Dewan-e- Hazoori. Surgdhan Village is also a famous place of Sohawa Tehsil. According to the 2017 census of Pakistan, the most widely spoken first languages are Punjabi (98%), Urdu (1.9%) and Pashto (0.1%). Urdu is spoken and understood by most of the population. According to the 2017 census of Pakistan, the most followed religion in Sohawa Tehsil is Islam followed by 98% of population. 2% is followed by other non Muslim minorities.  Health facilities  The Tehsil Headquarters Hospital (THQs) Sohawa for the people of Sohawa and surrounding rural areas has been developed by the Government of Pakistan that provides only basic health facilities. The hospital currently houses 40 beds, 20 for female and 20 for male patients. The following facilities are available: emergency services, 4 bedded labor room services, operation theater facilities, dental surgery, ambulance services, indoor services lab, X-Rays, ultrasonography facilities, ECG facilities, blood bank, 24 hours round the clock & OPD curative, and preventive and rehabilitative services. The following Posts of Specialists are still vacant: Medical Specialist, Child Specialist, gynecologist, ophthalmologist, ENT specialist, pathologist, and radiologist. This hospital offers free facilities for MCH and deliveries. Presently there are three female doctors to provide round the clock 24-hour care. There is also a rural health center in Domeli, which includes 12 basic health units (Adrana, Jandala, Nagial, Gurah Uttam Singh, Kohali, Phulray Syedan, Surgdhan, Dewan e Hazoori, Pail Mirza, Karounta, Panchor, and Banth), three Government rural dispensaries (Lehri, Gaddar, and Baragawah), and four Rural dispensaries (dial, Hayal, Pari derwaiza & Dhairy bakrala) to provide additional health services.  Major tribes and clans  The major tribes and clans of the district are the following: * Gakhars or Kayani - Sikandaraal, Bhogial, and other sub houses. Descendants of sultans who ruled the Potohar region from the borders of Gujarat to the south and Kashmir to the north in alliance with the Mughal Emperors. They were overcome during the Sikh invasion of Punjab where the Sikhs were better equipped and in a much larger force. Presently, most use the title raja, however, it is not known how this trend was brought about-possibly a generalization or derogatory method used under British rule. Malak (Garrison head) would be closer to the original title for most males of this tribe, while sultan would be reserved for the tribal head. * Rajputs - Akra, Bangial, Bhatti, Budhal Rajput, Chauhan, Dhammial, Janjua Rajput, Manhas and Panwars * Awan Malik the heads of all tribes * Chaudhary (Jats) - Dhillon, Gillzai (mostly belong to minorities), Hariar, Jandrial, Kamawal, Warraich, Kalyals, Kanyals, Khatarmal, Khattar, Makwal, Mathyals, Soomro, Tarar * Kashmiri * Mughals * Sayyid (Bukhari, Kazmi) * Sheikhs Many of the tribes listed above are presented in the British India Census of 1881, as both Raja and Jat clans. Hence the population is divided into both clans. Generally the 'als' are branches of Rajput clans.

Although it was numbered as the first piece in the trio of piano sonatas which were published as Opus 31 in 1803, Beethoven actually finished it after the Op. 31 No. 2, the Tempest Sonata. Due to his dissatisfaction with the classical style of music, Beethoven pledged to take a new path of musical composition and style. The Opus 31 works are the first examples of Beethoven's new and unconventional ideas, an attempt to make a name for himself in the annals of music history. For example, the first movement, unlike most sonata allegro forms in which the second theme of the exposition is dominant, the second theme is in B major and B minor, the mediant of the original key. Beethoven would later continue to use the mediant and submediant as expositional goals for major-key sonata-form movements, such as the first movements of the Waldstein and Hammerklavier sonatas, the Archduke trio, the triple concerto and the thirteenth string quartet, as well as the finale to the seventh symphony. It is important to take into account that these pieces were written after the famous Heiligenstadt Testament of 1802. This sonata is light, breezy and has touches of humour and irony in its movements.\\"Musicians with a literary bent – Honourable failures\\" by Anna Goldsworthy, The Monthly, October 2013. Goldsworthy quotes Jeremy Denk and Alfred Brendel's \\"Must Classical Music be Entirely Serious?\\" in his Music Sounded Out (1990). Critics say that the Opus 31 works show now a more pronounced \\"Beethovenian\\" sense of style that will become more evident in later, mature works. Structure The sonata consists of three movements. A typical performance lasts about 20 minutes. =Allegro vivace= The first movement begins in an animated fashion. The humorous main theme is littered with brisk, semiquaver passages, and chords written in a stuttering fashion, suggesting that the hands are unable to play in unison with one another. The second subject in the exposition alternates between B major and B minor; this tendency to alternate between keys became typical later in Beethoven's career. =Adagio grazioso= With long, drawn out trills and reflective pauses, the second movement in C major is the more sentimental movement. Apart from the Hammerklavier Sonata's Adagio and the 32nd sonata's second movement, this is the longest slow movement of Beethoven in the piano sonatas (around 11 minutes). According to many great pianists (e.g. Edwin Fischer and András Schiff), this movement is a parody of Italian opera and Beethoven's contemporaries, who were much more popular than Beethoven at the beginning of the 19th century. Schiff explained this theory in his master class of this sonata;Andras Schiff's lectures on the 32 Beethoven piano sonatas (audio only). he said it is totally uncharacteristic of Beethoven because it is not economical, it is incredibly long, everything is too much ornamented, it is filled with \\"show-off cadenzas (...) who are trying to make a cheap effect\\" and bel canto-like elements and rhythms (on them Schiff said \\"it's very beautiful, but it's alien to Beethoven's nature\\"). =Rondo= The last movement is similar in character to the first movement: light, enthusiastic, and youthful. Here, a single simple theme is varied, ornamented, syncopated, modulated throughout the piece. After a brief Adagio section, the piece ends with a Presto Coda.

Connective tissue is any type of biological tissue with an extensive extracellular matrix that supports, binds together, and protects organs. These tissues form a framework, or matrix, for the body, and are composed of two major structural protein molecules: collagen and elastin. There are many different types of collagen protein in each of the body's tissues. Elastin has the capability of stretching and returning to its original length—like a spring or rubber band. Elastin is the major component of ligaments (tissues that attach bone to bone) and skin. In patients with connective tissue disease, it is common for collagen and elastin to become injured by inflammation (ICT). Many connective tissue diseases feature abnormal immune system activity with inflammation in tissues as a result of an immune system that is directed against one's own body tissues (autoimmunity).William C. Shiel Jr.,Connective Tissue Disease Diseases in which inflammation or weakness of collagen tends to occur are also referred to as collagen diseases. Collagen vascular diseases can be (but are not necessarily) associated with collagen and blood vessel abnormalities and that are autoimmune in nature. See also vasculitis. Connective tissue diseases can have strong or weak inheritance risks, and can also be caused by environmental factors. Heritable connective tissue disorders * Marfan syndrome – a genetic disease causing abnormal fibrillin. * Ehlers–Danlos syndrome – defect in the synthesis of collagen (Type I or III) causes progressive deterioration of collagens, with different EDS types affecting different sites in the body, such as joints, heart valves, organ walls, arterial walls. * Osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) – caused by poor quality collagen, or insufficient amounts of normal collagen (primarily type I), necessary for healthy, strong bones and certain other connective tissues. * Stickler syndrome – affects collagen (primarily type II and XI), and may result in a distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and joint problems. *Alport syndrome – defects in collagen (type IV), found in the renal basement membrane, inner ear and eyes, leading to glomerulonephritis, hearing loss, and eye disease, respectively. * Congenital contractural arachnodactyly – Also known as Beals syndrome. It is akin to Marfan syndrome but with contractures of hip, knee, elbows and ankle joint and crumpled ear. * Loeys–Dietz syndrome – The disorder is marked by aneurysms in the aorta, often in children. Symptoms appear to be like Marfan Syndrome and EDS. This is caused by a mutation in the gene TGFBR on either chromosome 3 or 9 depending on the type. Autoimmune connective tissue disorders These are also referred to as systemic autoimmune diseases. The autoimmune CTDs may have both genetic and environmental causes. Genetic factors may create a predisposition towards developing these autoimmune diseases. They are characterized as a group by the presence of spontaneous overactivity of the immune system that results in the production of extra antibodies into the circulation. The classic collagen vascular diseases have a \\"classic\\" presentation with typical findings that doctors can recognize during an examination. Each also has \\"classic\\" blood test abnormalities and abnormal antibody patterns. However, each of these diseases can evolve slowly or rapidly from very subtle abnormalities before demonstrating the classic features that help in the diagnosis. The classic collagen vascular diseases include: * Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – An inflammation of the connective tissues, SLE can afflict every organ system. It is up to nine times more common in women than men and affects black women three times as often as white women. The condition is aggravated by sunlight. * Rheumatoid arthritis – Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disorder in which immune cells attack and inflame the membrane around joints. It also can affect the heart, lungs, and eyes. Of the estimated 2.1 million Americans with rheumatoid arthritis, approximately 1.5 million (71 percent) are women. * Scleroderma – an activation of immune cells that produces scar tissue in the skin, internal organs, and small blood vessels. It affects women three times more often than men overall, but increases to a rate 15 times greater for women during childbearing years, and appears to be more common among black women. * Sjögren's syndrome – also called Sjögren's disease, is a chronic, slowly progressing inability to secrete saliva and tears. It can occur alone or with rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Nine out of 10 cases occur in women, most often at or around mid-life. * Mixed connective tissue disease – Mixed connective-tissue disease (MCTD) is a disorder in which features of various connective-tissue diseases (CTDs) such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); systemic sclerosis (SSc); dermatomyositis (DM); polymyositis (PM); anti-synthetase syndrome; and, occasionally, Sjögren syndrome can coexist and overlap. The course of the disease is chronic and usually milder than other CTDs. In most cases, MCTD is considered an intermediate stage of a disease that eventually becomes either SLE or Scleroderma. * Undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) is a disease in which the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues. It is diagnosed when there is evidence of an existing autoimmune condition which does not meet the criteria for any specific autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Latent lupus and incomplete lupus are alternative terms that have been used to describe this condition. * Psoriatic arthritis is also a collagen vascular disease.Medline Plus, Collagen vascular disease. Other connective tissue disorders * Peyronie's disease – involving the growth of abnormal collagen (Type I and III) in the penis. * Scurvy – caused by a dietary deficiency in vitamin C, leading to abnormal collagen. * Fibromuscular dysplasia a disease of the blood vessels leading to abnormal growth in the arterial wall.

The establishment of the Commission followed various unsuccessful attempts by the Federal Government to impose greater regulation upon the conduct of industrial relations in that industry. The Royal Commission commenced on 29 August 2001 and was overseen by a sole Royal Commissioner, The Honourable Justice Terence Cole . Justice Cole handed the commission's final report to the Governor- General on 24 February 2003; and the report was tabled in parliament on 26 and 27 March 2003. Although the Commission found no evidence of organised criminal activity, it did articulate a case that the industry was characterised by lawlessness in the conduct of industrial relations. It recommended sweeping changes to industrial relations laws applicable to the industry. The government's attempts to implement those recommendations stalled in 2004, but were revived in 2005 after the Howard government secured control of the Senate. The Royal Commission led to the enactment of the and the establishment of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner (ABCC), an independent statutory authority responsible for monitoring and promoting workplace relations in the Australian building and construction industry. The ABCC was active between October 2005 and May 2012, when, following enactment of the , its functions were superseded by Fair Work Building and Construction, an agency of the Australian government. The agency was re-established in December 2016 as the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Background =The Building and Construction Industry= =Federal government industry reform policy= In May 1997 the Federal Government, with agreement from the States, prepared a National Building Industry Code of Practice. The government supplemented the Code with Implementation Guidelines. Fundamentally, the Code and the Guidelines were an attempt to regulate the conduct of industrial relations on construction projects funded by government, through the medium of contract rather than legislation. In July 1997 the (then) Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business formed a 'Workplace Reform Group' targeting four industries for reform: the meat processing industry, the coal mining industry, the building and construction industry and the waterfront industry. The Workplace Relations Act and the Trade Practices Act 1974 were to provide the legal tools to deliver reform. The 1998 waterfront dispute was a reflection of the focus placed on these important industries. =Conflict within CFMEU= At about the time that the Royal Commission was announced, there had been, for some time, open conflict within the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU. On the one side, led by Divisional Secretary John Sutton and NSW Divisional Branch Secretary Andrew Ferguson, forces associated with the old Building Workers' Industrial Union were seeking to maintain their control over the Division. On the other side, led by Victorian and WA Divisional Branch Secretaries, Martin Kingham and Kevin Reynolds, forces associated with the old Builders Labourers Federation were seeking to exert greater influence within the union. The battle for control over the Divisional Conference led to a range of court cases. At one point, the Divisional Secretary, John Sutton, made allegations of organised criminal activity within the union. These allegations were aired on the ABC 4Corners program, and widely cited by government ministers as justifying the calling of a royal commission. =Report of the Employment Advocate= In April 2001 the Minister for Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, asked the Employment Advocate to provide a report \\"regarding behaviour in the building industry\\". In May 2001, the Employment Advocate provided a report which summarised statistics concerning complaints received by his office relating to alleged breaches of Freedom of Association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act; 'coercion' in agreement making, right of entry and strike pay provisions of the Act. The report criticised other law enforcement agencies, alleging that complaints \\"will simply not be actioned with any priority, or at all\\". This criticism mirrored certain criticisms levelled at the Victoria Police, after the 1998 waterfront dispute, to the effect that police should have been more aggressively involved in a picket-breaking role, rather than merely keeping the peace. The report alleged that, \\"ill willed\\" people have ample opportunities to \\"cause major disruption to a site\\" by misuse of occupational health and safety procedures. The report alleged misuse of various industry funds, including trust funds established to preserve employee entitlements such as leave pay and superannuation: \\"There have been allegations that senior union appointed trustees have sought to influence the investment decisions of at least one of these trusts for political and/or industrial purposes.\\" Most dramatically, the report alleged that union officials accepted secret commissions, engaged in bribery, and criminal corrupt conduct. The report concluded that 'there certainly appears to be a case for a broader investigation of the industry', and that 'it would require special investigative powers to gather and elicit information beyond that normally available to a government authority'. * Employment Advocate's report, 11 May 2001.http://www.dewrsb.gov.au/ministersandmediacentre/mediacentre/attachments/dme14311.pdf Appointment of Commissioner On 29 August 2001, the Governor-General issued Commonwealth Letters Patent pursuant to \\"the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia\\", the and other enabling powers\\" appointing The Honourable Justice Terence Cole as the sole Commissioner and the commission's terms of reference. The commissioner was directed \\"...to inquire into certain matters relating to the building and construction industry...\\" Subsequent to the Royal Commission, Cole was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2005 for \\"service to the judiciary, particularly judicial administration, to reform of the building and construction industry, and to the community through the Australian Naval Reserve and conservation and arts organisations.\\" Terms of Reference The Commissioner was appointed to investigate certain matters in relation to the building and construction industry. Those matters were defined in the Letters Patent as follows: :(a) the nature, extent and effect of any unlawful or otherwise inappropriate industrial or workplace practice or conduct, including, but not limited to: ::(i) any practice or conduct relating to the Workplace Relations Act 1996, occupational health and safety laws, or other laws relating to workplace relations; and ::(ii) fraud, corruption, collusion or anti-competitive behaviour, coercion, violence, or inappropriate payments, receipts or benefits; and ::(iii) dictating, limiting or interfering with decisions whether or not to employ or engage persons, or relating to the terms on which they be employed or engaged; :(b) the nature, extent and effect of any unlawful or otherwise inappropriate practice or conduct relating to: ::(i) failure to disclose or properly account for financial transactions undertaken by employee or employer organisations or their representatives or associates; or ::(ii) inappropriate management, use or operation of industry funds for training, long service leave, redundancy or superannuation; :(c) taking into account your findings in relation to the matters referred to in the preceding paragraphs and other relevant matters, any measures, including legislative and administrative changes, to improve practices or conduct in the building and construction industry or to deter unlawful or inappropriate practices or conduct in relation to that industry. Powers The powers of Royal Commissions in Australia are set out in the enabling legislation, the . Royal Commissions, appointed pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act or otherwise, have powers to issue a summons to a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing to give evidence or to produce documents specified in the summons; require witnesses to take an oath or give an affirmation; and require a person to deliver documents to the Commission at a specified place and time. A person served with a summons or a notice to produce documents must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is a fine of or six months imprisonment. A Royal Commission may authorise the Australian Federal Police to execute search warrants. =Further reading= * Donaghue, S., Royal Commissions and Permanent Commissions of Inquiry (Butterworths, 2001) * Australian Law Review articles, probably cited in Donoghue Procedures and methods At the opening of public hearings in October 2001, the Commission published a proposed 'practice note' which would govern how parties were to be granted leave to appear before it. The practice note required that any party wishing to be represented and to appear before the Commission must, as a condition of such grant of leave, provide the Commission with a statement setting out all matters within that person's knowledge as to the subject matter of the inquiry. Robert Richter QC (appearing on behalf of a WA official of the CFMEU) described the proposed practice notes as requiring that parties submit to a \\"stalinist obligation to inform\\" The Commission conducted open hearings on 171 days, and private (closed) hearings on 22 days.http://www.royalcombci.gov.au/docs/finalreport/V02Conduct_PressFinal.pdf#page=33 See generally * Volume 2 of the Final Report * Practice Notes Criticism * ACTU Submission to Senate inquiry * David McElrea, Cole Royal Commission: the case for bias * CFMEU Construction & General Division submission to Senate inquiry * Jim Marr, First the Verdict: The real story of the Building Industry Royal Commission (Pluto Press, 2003) Legal challenges There were two legal proceedings brought against the Cole Commission during 2002. The first, brought in the name of Martin Kingham and others, was conducted on behalf of the Victorian Building Unions Divisional Branch of the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU. The second, brought in the name of Andrew Ferguson and others, was conducted on behalf of the NSW Divisional Branch of the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU. Neither of these challenges were successful. =Kingham v Cole= The applicants sought administrative law relief to prevent the Commissioner conducting the Royal Commission in accordance with the provisions of pars 12 to 15 of the Commission's Practice Note 2. His decision to do so was challenged under ss 5 and 6 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth). The Practice note sought to impose conditions on a person's right to cross-examine witnesses appearing before the Royal Commission. Justice Heely summarised the applicant's argument this way: :Senior counsel for the applicant attacked the validity of par 12 of the Practice Note on two grounds. First it was put that at common law Royal Commissions have no coercive powers: McGuinness v Attorney-General for Victoria (1940) 63 CLR 73 at 98-99, Herald & Weekly Times Limited v Woodward [1995] 1 VR 156 at 159. Any coercive powers must be found in the relevant statute under which the Royal Commission is established. Nothing in the Act compels the provision of a witness statement or its adoption in the witness box as prescribed in the Practice Note. It is impermissible to require, as a condition precedent to the exercise of the right to cross-examine, the performance of an obligation which is beyond the power of the Commissioner to impose. Paragraph 12 of the Practice Note is an attempt by the Commissioner to do indirectly what he cannot do directly: Wragg v New South Wales (1953) 88 CLR 353 at 387-8, Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v Best (1990) 170 CLR 516 at 522. Further, it was said that the Commissioner did not have an unfettered discretion to grant or refuse leave to cross-examine. Secondly, it was put that the rules of natural justice may in some circumstances include the right to cross-examine a witness giving evidence adverse to a person affected. Paragraph 12 of the Practice Note was in absolute terms and applicable to all cross-examination, including cross- examination which was an exercise of rights conferred by the rules of natural justice. These arguments were rejected: :Of course, if in the exercise of his discretion under s 6FA the Commissioner imposed a condition that had no reasonable connection with his function under the Act or the Letters Patent, that would not be a valid exercise of power. To take an extreme example, a direction that leave to cross-examine would not be granted unless an applicant made a donation to a political party would be plainly invalid. But par 12 on its face seems rationally and reasonably related to the efficient performance of the obligations of the Commissioner. Paragraph 12 is a means of ascertaining whether or not an applicant has demonstrated a sufficient interest in challenging the evidence of a particular witness. Further, a statement under par 12 will alert the Commissioner and all others concerned as to the true extent of factual disputes and thus promote the efficient resolution of those disputes. In a large and complex administrative enquiry where there is no equivalent to the pleadings and particulars used in civil litigation, the par 12 procedure has an obvious utility. :Further, I am not persuaded that par 12 creates unfairness in the broad sense which the law relating to natural justice postulates. The applicants filed an appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, but this appeal was abandoned shortly afterwards. * Kingham v Cole [2002] FCA 45 (1 February 2002) =Ferguson v Cole= On 29 August 2002 the applicants made an application to the Commissioner that he disqualify himself from, in effect, making findings of fact or recommendations in relation to New South Wales which may have an adverse impact on the applicants. On 6 September 2002 the Commissioner published reasons for his decision to dismiss the application made to him.Judgment re Disqualification royalcombci.gov.au, Retrieved 2012-11-12. In this proceeding the applicants claimed that the Commissioner has shown actual bias towards them or, alternatively, by his conduct has given rise to a reasonable apprehension that he is biased towards them. They also asserted that they have been denied procedural fairness by reason of the process of inquiry adopted by the Royal Commission. The Court dismissed the application. The Court rejected the contention that the Commissioner by the First Report made findings which directly and adversely affected the interests of the applicants. The Court also rejected the contention that the First Report shows that the Commissioner was, or could reasonably be apprehended to be, so committed to conclusions which he had already formed that he would be incapable of altering those conclusions. * Ferguson v Cole [2002] FCA 1411 (20 November 2002) Reports An Interim Building Industry Taskforce ReportInterim Report, 15 August 2002 (pdf) was delivered on 15 August 2002; and a Building Industry Taskforce Report delivered. The Commissioner presented his final report to the Governor-General on 24 February 2003; and the report was tabled in Parliament on 26 and 27 March 2003. Recommendations =Prosecutions= =Legislation= Outcomes The Government responded to the 212 recommendations of the Royal Commission; allocated more than $136 million in the 2004-05 Federal Budget; and appointed Colin Thatcher as a member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. On 2 April 2003, Federal Cabinet decided to extend the operation of the Building Industry Task Force, pending the establishment of the proposed Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC). Cabinet also supported separate legislation to regulate the construction industry. On 25 March 2004, the Minister announced that the taskforce would become a permanent body, and would 'continue to operate until the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill is passed by this Parliament', and the ABCC established. =Prosecutions= Nil. =Legislation= The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 was tabled in Parliament; with an Explanatory Memorandum circulated by Minister. The Minister delivered his Second Reading Speech on 6 November 2003. In 2004, the Parliamentary Library published an analysis of the Bill's history. In October 2003 the Senate referred the Bill to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee for inquiry and report. The Committee received submissions,http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/eet_ctte/completed_inquiries/2002-04/building03/submissions/sublist.htm conducted hearings,http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/eet_ctte/completed_inquiries/2002-04/building03/hearings/index.htm and tabled its Reporthttp://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/eet_ctte/completed_inquiries/2002-04/building03/report/index.htm on 21 June 2004. The Committee, by a majority composed of Senators from the Democrats and Labor, recommended that the Senate oppose the government's legislation. Government senators on the Committee, in minority, recommended that the legislation be passed. Passage of the Bill stalled. The Coalition government was returned at the 2004 election and secured control of the Senate with effect from July 2005. On 4 November 2004, the Minister for Workplace Relations Kevin Andrews announced that the legislation would be reintroduced into the new Parliament. The revised 2005 Bill passed both houses and was enacted, with Assent given to the on 12 September 2005. =Regulator established= The Act enabled the establishment of an independent statutory authority, the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner (ABCC). The role of the ABCC was to monitor and promote appropriate standards of conduct throughout the building and construction industry. The ABCC operated between 2005 and 2012. Cost The Commission's own estimate of its expenditures, as at the date of publishing its report, was that it had spent approximately 60 million. This figure makes this Royal Commission one of the most expensive in Australia's history.See Chapter 5 of Volume 22 of the Final Report (PDF)  References  External links and sources  * BCI RC Website * Building Industry Royal Commission: Background, Findings and Recommendations (Australian Parliament, Department of the Parliamentary Library, Current Issues Brief No.30 2002-2003) * Marr, Jim, First the Verdict: The real story of the Building Industry Royal Commission (Pluto Press, 2003) Category:Australian labour law Building and construction Category:2001 establishments in Australia Category:2003 disestablishments in Australia Category:Construction industry of Australia ","title":"Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry"},{"id":"2083219","text":"Hans Eicke (1 December 1884 – 22 August 1947) was a German athlete.

Its common title was taken from the name of its chairperson, NSW Supreme Court judge Athol Moffitt. Its formal title was the Royal Commission of Inquiry in respect of certain matters relating to allegations of organised crime in clubs. Background In August 1973, the New South Wales Government appointed Mr Justice Moffitt to head the Commission. It was set up to address public and media concerns about the growing extent of organised crime in NSW and to investigate specific allegations that the Bally poker machine company now Bally Technologies, -- which was allegedly linked to the Mafia in the United States—was seeking to expand its interests in Australia, and that this might act as a conduit for Mafia-style organised crime to develop and diversify in Australia. Police investigations into organised crime had been inconclusive, official reports were contradictory and often widely criticised, and both the then NSW Police Commissioner Norman Allan and NSW Premier Robert Askin (who were themselves alleged to have been involved in organised crime) repeatedly denied that there was any sort of organised crime in NSW or that there were any corrupt links between criminals and police or government officials. Widespread allegations of official corruption in the NSW police force and the NSW government had been highlighted by a string of highly publicised scandals, notably the so-called \\"Arantz Affair\\", in which police computer expert Phillip Arantz was sacked from the NSW Police Service for leaking information to the media, after he discovered that the NSW police had systematically under-reporting crime statistics over a period of years. There was also increasing public concern about the escalation of the trade in illegal drugs in NSW in the late 1960s and early 1970s, especially in regard to the rapid growth of the heroin trade. The first witness called before the Commission was investigative journalist Bob Bottom,ABC Radio National website whose media reports on organised crime had contributed to the growing pressure for a high-level investigation into these matters. Other notable witnesses included career criminal Lenny McPherson, the man typically referred to as Sydney's \\"Mr Big\\". Shortly before his death, Justice Moffitt revealed that McPherson (who had since died) had been a paid informant to the Commission. In his final report, handed down in 1974, Justice Moffitt found there was a real danger that organised crime from overseas would infiltrate Australia. He identified the difficulties investigating organised crime presents to law enforcement agencies. Among his recommendations was a \\"frank and drastic review of the methods of investigation of organised crime of overseas and local origin and that particular procedures be established appropriate to this as a special class of crime\\"'. He further recommended that a special squad of police be trained and established to deal with aspects of organised crime and that a 'task force' method be incorporated within this special squad.

In other types of music, \\"head\\" may refer to the first or most prominent section of a song. The term may, though obtusely, be applied to classical music, insofar as classical pieces generally bear similar thematic elements, but the preferred term in this instance is (main) theme or subject. The term \\"head\\" is most often used in jazz and may refer to the thematic melody, an instance of it in a performance of the song, or a more abstract compilation of ideas as to what the song is. It may also, though uncommonly, refer to the first section of the melody, or the theme riff in the melody. There is a slightly related musical direction, D.C. or da capo (Italian, from head), which means to go back to the very beginning of the sheet music and play to the end, typically ignoring all repeat signs. What's in a head The idea a head represents comprises a combination of elements. No one piece of written music defines what the \\"head\\" of many jazz tunes really is, but a boiler-plate jazz chart, which is often only a page long in large print, will tell you: * the key and time signature * the melody * the set of chord changes (referred to simply as \\"the changes\\"), and * sometimes, but rarely, lyrics as well as more general information such as * the title and author of the piece * indications of style, tempo, dynamics and form. The form is an even more general and abstract concept dealing with the theoretical context in which the actual music is being played: the chord progression, its sections and other miscellaneous events such as kicks or time changes are all important information that the performers must keep track of. Two important standard forms over which hundreds of heads have been written are the 12-bar blues and rhythm changes. Some heads are based on the forms of other tunes, such as Charlie Parker's \\"Ornithology\\", which is based on Morgan Lewis's \\"How High the Moon\\". Fake books may contain anywhere from a handful to hundreds of charts like these, occasionally stretching into two pages and on rare occasions going further and requiring page turns. There are many heads that are considered such a part of standard jazz repertoire (see jazz standard) that professional players are expected to know them by memory and be able to perform them in a variety of ways on the spot. Use In playing the actual music, the head refers to any time the band or musician plays the theme to the song. Usually this happens once or twice at the beginning and the end of a performance. For example, many Clifford Brown recordings characteristically feature a short piano intro, the head, several choruses of solos and a recapitulation of the head followed by an outro coda. Although it most commonly is, the head does not need to be played at both the beginning and the end of a performance, and is occasionally played in the middle, for instance between solos. Head In and Head Out are commonly used to refer to the first and last heads [of a piece] played. Jazz musicians often give each other the \\"head\\" or \\"top\\" cue by patting their hand on top of their head, which is usually meant to make sure everybody \\"goes back to the head,\\" or starts playing the head again the next time the \\"top of the form\\" comes around. On the unfortunate occasion this may be due to confusion about \\"where\\" the top of the form actually is if the musicians get off-sync with one another, or a frantic attempt to regain composure and finish the performance, as playing the head to end a piece is default jam session protocol. Knowing heads Jazz musicians are frequently called upon to play a series of songs in short order with no planning, either at jam sessions or impromptu gigs. Therefore, it is important for professionals to know as wide a variety of tunes as possible and be able to play them proficiently. Most of the time this means memorizing the melody, chords and anything else important about playing the song with a band. Sometimes there will be fake books available at jam sessions, and sometimes it is easy to recall a tune while playing it or learn it on the spot, but for the most part it is expected that professional jazz musicians have a very large vocabulary of tunes available by memory.

The commission was a penetrating investigation of organised crime, revealing for the first time the power and influence of the Calabrian mafia in Australia. According to a book published in 2009 co-authored by former NSW Police Assistant Commissioner, Clive Small: :\\"Woodward's report was the first to publicly identify members of the Calabrian mafia in Australia and the first to expose the scale of its drug- dealing. Woodward gave every justification for the government to crack down on the Calabrians but it didn’t happen. And it still hasn’t happened. Only the drugs have changed.\\" Background and Terms of Reference Discoveries or marijuana plantations in several places in New South Wales, allegations that a criminal organisation existed based in the production and distribution of drugs and the sudden unexplained accumulation of wealth, especially in the town of Griffith lead to lobbying for a Royal Commission into the drug trafficking business. The pressure culminated after 15 July 1977 when the disappearance of Donald Bruce Mackay, an activist against the drug trade, was believed to have been engineered by drug trafficking interests. The commission was proclaimed in NSW Government Gazette on 5 August 1977 (p. 3339) when the Honourable Philip Morgan Woodward was appointed sole Commissioner to: :\\"enquire into and report upon ::1.

The term was subsequently extended twice and the final report of the commission was submitted to the Governor on 31 October 1979. The Commissioner's terms of reference were restricted to the legal aspects of drug trafficking rather than medical or social aspects. Hearings commenced on 10 August 1977 and the Commissioner conducted public hearings on 175 days and in camera hearings on 146 days. Evidence was given by 565 witnesses and 1000 summonses were issued for the production of documents or the attendance of witnesses. The Commissioner gathered information in North America and other overseas countries in 1978. The Royal Commissioner studied, examined and reported upon the following drugs - cannabis; narcotics; heroin; amphetamines, cocaine and hallucinogens. For each drug he reported upon the nature, history, use, reported seizures, and the nature of the trade. In addition the Commissioner studied seizures which had occurred in various places in the State including The Riverina, Colleambally, Euston, Wollongong, Sutherland and St George and Byron Bay, and the operation of known importers and distributors. The Commissioner reported on the treatment of drug offenders and the current statutory provision for dealing with drug offenses. The report of the Commission concluded with a total of 89 recommendations in the general areas of statutory, legal administration and law enforcement reform, identification of drug users, promotion of programs to discourage drug use, information sharing amongst various agencies concerned with drug trade (health, drug regulation, communications and law enforcement); co-operation with other Australian jurisdictions, other countries and international agencies in obtaining information about and dealing with the drug problem; and improved treatment of drug addicts. The Royal Commission concluded on 31 October when the report was handed to the Governor in the Premier's Office.

Later, some hata-jirushi were hemmed on the sides to create a sleeve for a pole on the side and top, or had pieces of fabric attaching their side and top to poles to make the banners visible from the front. There are two variants of the Hata-jirushi: One end of the cross-piece was attached to the shaft or the cross-piece was suspended from the shaft, similar to the Vexillum. Hata-jirushi served much the same purpose as the nobori, which replaced them, identifying and distinguishing regiments or sections of an army.

He followed Pál Simon and Frigyes Wiesner and was followed by Ödön Bodor. Nagy had a six-yard lead over the Swedish team in the first round, but was unable to hold on to it. He made the transfer to Bodor while three yards behind. Bodor was able to regain the lead in the second half of the race to keep the Hungarians in the competition. In the final, Nagy was able to make the transfer to Bodor while five yards ahead of the German runners, though hopelessly behind the dominant American team. This time it was Bodor who was passed, and the Hungarians finished third. Nagy also competed in the 400, 800, and 1,500 metre races, but did not advance to the final in any of them.

(The election was supposed to be held in 1916, but due to the emergency of the First World War, the government postponed the election, largely in hope that a coalition government could be formed, as was the case in Britain.) **Result: Prime Minister Robert Borden's Unionists, an alliance of pro- conscription politicians, increase their majority. The vote in Canada is heavily divided along anglophone and francophone lines. *1958 Canadian federal election **Reason: Newly elected Liberal leader Lester Pearson made a speech demanding that the Conservatives hand back power without an electionAt the time, Pearson's demand was not seen to be as unreasonable as it would be today, and appeared as though it could be backed by more than the threat of a backlash among the voters. Barely three decades had passed since the King-Byng Affair, when then-Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King was compelled by then-Governor General Julian Byng to resign when Byng would not grant a dissolution of parliament. Pearson may have believed that the Governor General then in office (Vincent Massey, who had been appointed under Louis St. Laurent) would cite that precedent if Diefenbaker requested a dissolution only nine months after the last election. Massey's granting of Diefenbaker's request for a dissolution entrenched the constitutional convention that the Sovereign's representative would never refuse a request for dissolution. because of the recent economic decline. Diefenbaker responded by revealing a formerly classified Liberal file that predicted the economic malaise, so the \\"arrogant\\" label that had attached to Liberals in 1957 stayed. Also, the resignation of Louis St. Laurent had also left Quebec with no favourite son leader and the Conservatives also harnessed the powerful political machine of the provincial Union Nationale. The Conservatives thus hoped to obtain a majority government. **Result: Prime Minister John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservatives win the largest majority up to that time at the federal level. *1962 Quebec general election **Reason: Obtain a clear mandate to nationalize the electricity industry. **Result: Premier Jean Lesage's Liberals win an increased majority. *1976 Quebec general election **Reason: Counting on a boost from his successful rescue of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal after cost overruns and construction delays by the Montreal municipal government, Liberal Premier Robert Bourassa called an early election well before the five- year maximum term ended. **Result: The separatist Parti Québécois, led by René Lévesque, defeated the incumbent Liberals in a landslide to form government for the first time and set the stage for the 1980 Quebec referendum. The once- powerful Union Nationale (Quebec) made a modest comeback, winning 11 seats under Rodrigue Biron, and for the first time won significant support from some anglophone voters. Bourassa lost his seat and resigned as Liberal leader to pursue an academic career, before leading the Liberals back to power in 1985. *1982 Alberta general election **Reason: Surging support for separatism, marked by a victory for the separatist Western Canada Concept in a by-election held earlier in the year. **Result: Premier Peter Lougheed's Tories win a massive majority, with the WCC failing to retain its recently won seat or win any others. *1984 Canadian federal election **Reason: Newly minted Liberal leader John Turner was persuaded by internal polls that he was well ahead of the opposition. He also wanted to present a \\"new\\" party, different from his predecessor Pierre Trudeau. Turner did not have a seat in the Commons, and his election call was just four days after being sworn in. However, the Liberals had been elected in 1980 and Turner would constitutionally be allowed to wait until 1985 to call an election. **Result: Turner's 200 patronage appointments, mostly on the recommendation of Trudeau, nullified attempts to distance himself from Trudeau's policies and practices. The Liberal's Quebec stronghold was also nullified as Conservative leader Brian Mulroney was a native of that province. The Progressive Conservatives win the largest majority ever at the federal level, while the Liberals end up with 40 seats, only ten more than the NDP's 30. *1989 Alberta general election **Reason: Opposition support evenly divided between NDs and Liberals. **Result: Premier Donald Getty's Tories win a slightly reduced majority, but Getty loses his own seat and must run in a by-election. *1990 Ontario general election **Reason: Favourable opinion polls, as the ruling Liberals are still above the 50% mark. Premier David Peterson allegedly wanted to call an election before the full effects of the looming recession could be felt. Some within his party oppose the early election call (they had won a huge majority in 1987). **Result: The Liberals are beset by controversies and scandals right after the campaign started, with unions and interest groups expressing their cynicism about the snap election. Bob Rae's NDP managed an electoral upset, slightly outpolling the Liberals in the popular vote but winning enough seats for a majority. Peterson loses his own seat and resigns the party leadership. *1997 Canadian federal election **Reason: Favourable opinion polls. Some government MPs opposed the snap election, as cleanup from the devastating Red River Flood was still underway. This was also the second shortest majority mandate in Canadian history, after Laurier's 1908–1911 term. **Result: Jean Chrétien's Liberals barely retain their majority, though they easily have the plurality of seats to continue governing. The NDP and Progressive Conservatives win enough seats, mainly at the expense of the Liberals in the Atlantic provinces, to regain official party status. *2000 Canadian federal election **Reason: Prime Minister Jean Chrétien planned to call an election before the newly formed Canadian Alliance could consolidate itself outside of its western Canadian base. The call was also to take advantage of newly elected leader Stockwell Day's lack of experience as a federal politician. (Day also dared Chrétien to call an election.) **Result: In a campaign lacking important issues and record low turnout, Chrétien's Liberals were re-elected with an increased majority, taking back seats in Atlantic Canada that they lost to the NDP and Progressive Conservatives in the previous election. *2008 Quebec general election **Reason: In the previous election of 2007, Premier Jean Charest's Liberals were re-elected but only as a minority government. The election was called, claiming the need for a mandate to tackle the late 2000s financial crisis. **Result: The Quebec Liberal Party was returned with a majority and the Parti Québécois under Pauline Marois came second as support for Mario Dumont's ADQ collapsed. *2012 Quebec general election **Reason: Faced with student protests and corruption allegations, Liberal Premier Jean Charest called a snap election to seek a fourth consecutive mandate, pitting the Liberals against Pauline Marois's Parti Québécois a second time. **Result: Pauline Marois's Parti Québécois is elected to form a minority government, with a massive decline in the Liberals' vote and Premier Charest losing his seat. The Coalition Avenir Québec, in its first electoral test, came in third place but coming close to beating the Liberals' in the popular vote. *2014 Quebec general election **Reason: Premier Pauline Marois's Parti Québécois sought a majority government having won government in 2012 in minority. Marois called an election due to favourable opinion polls and facing imminent defeat on the 2014-15 provincial budget. **Result: The Quebec Liberal Party under Philippe Couillard won a majority government defeating the incumbent Parti Québécois government, becoming the first single-term government since 1970. It marked the lowest seat total for the Parti Québécois since 1989 and its smallest share of the popular vote since 1970, with Pauline Marois losing her own riding. The Coalition Avenir Québec under François Legault made minor gains in terms of seats despite receiving a smaller share of the popular vote than in the 2012 election. *2014 Ontario general election **Reason: The Ontario New Democrats announced that they would not support the minority Liberal government's budget. Facing certain defeat on the budget in the Legislative Assembly, Premier Kathleen Wynne called an election before the eventual budget vote. **Result: The Liberals regained majority government, Progressive Conservative leader Tim Hudak resigned after losing a second election, while the NDP remained in third place. *2015 Alberta general election **Reason: Premier Jim Prentice called for an election on April 7, 2015, a year earlier than expected, because he \\"needed a mandate to implement a tough budget\\" that proposed higher taxes, fees, and cuts in government spending. **Result: Rachel Notley, representing the NDP, won a majority government for the first time in their history, ending the Progressive Conservative's 43-year reign in government. The Wildrose Party became the official opposition, while the Progressive Conservatives went down to 10 seats, their worst defeat since the 1967 election. The Wildrose and Progressive Conservative parties would subsequently merge, creating the United Conservative Party. *2019 Manitoba general election **Reason: Premier Brian Pallister called an election just over a year ahead of schedule, citing a need to seek a new mandate to continue implementing the government's platform for Manitoba. The election was called for September 10, 2019, just one day before the writs were issued for the 2019 Canadian federal election. **Result: The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba won a second majority government with 36 out 57 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and 47.07% of the popular vote. *2020 New Brunswick general election **Reason: Premier Blaine Higgs called an election for September 14, 2020, saying stability was required for the next phase of the pandemic and economic recovery. At the time, Higgs led a minority government. **Result: The Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick won a majority government with 27 out 49 seats in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick and 39.27% of the popular vote. It also marked the first time a government had been re-elected in New Brunswick since 2003. *2020 British Columbia general election **Reason: Premier John Horgan had led a minority government under a confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party of British Columbia, due to expire in June 2021. He called an election for October 24, 2020, to avoid creating \\"uncertainty and instability\\" in a minority government situation during the COVID-19 pandemic, which he said he expected to last well into the next year. **Result: Notes elections, snap Snap ","title":"List of snap elections in Canada"},{"id":"2083287","text":"Professor \\"Leo\\" Cheung Kam Ching (張錦青, born 1963) is a philosopher in Hong Kong.

Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon short directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. The cartoon was released on August 8, 1953, and stars Bugs Bunny.  Synopsis  Tunneling his way to the Coachella Valley for the \\"big carrot festival therein,\\" Bugs Bunny gets lost, and wanders into a Mexican bullring in the middle of a bullfight between Toro the Bull and a very scared matador. Bugs looks at his map and famously declares: \\"I knew I shoulda taken that left toin at Albukoikee\\". As he asks the matador for directions, the matador escapes into the stands, leaving Bugs to fend for himself against Toro. After irritating Bugs and getting a slap for \\"steamin' up [his] tail,\\" Toro chalks up the points of his horns like a pool cue and rams the rabbit out of the bullring. As he sails into the air, a furious Bugs decides to exact revenge on Toro and says his famous line: \\"Of course you realize this means war\\". Toro takes his applause for claiming his latest victim (and pushes a bead across a scoring wire, as in billiards), but it is short-lived because Bugs re-enters the bullring in matador garb. Bugs defeats Toro using an anvil hidden behind his cape. While Toro is still dazed from his collision, and accompanied by a lively underscore of \\"La Cucaracha\\", Bugs makes the bull follow the cape to a bull shield; Toro's horns pierce it. Bugs bends the horns down like nails and, thinking he has got Toro at bay, makes fun of him using puns (\\"What a gulli-bull, what a nin-cow-poop\\"), unaware that the bull can detach his horns and strike back. Toro proceeds to bash Bugs in the head, which knocks him unconscious. While Toro sharpens his horns, Bugs interrupts him by placing an elastic band around the horns and using it as a giant slingshot to smack him in the face with a boulder. As Bugs accepts accolades from the crowd, Toro charges, catching the rabbit in the posterior and pushing him through a wall. Bugs then returns, this time wearing a large sombrero, doing a little dance, and slapping Toro on the face in tempo to the tune of \\"Las Chiapanecas\\". Toro tries to go toward him twice but is slapped each time. Bugs dances more and then disappears under the sombrero, but not before honking Toro's nose. While Toro once again sharpens his horns (this time with an angry face), Bugs has prepared a booby trap for the bull, composed of a double-barreled shotgun hidden behind the cape. Toro charges the cape and somehow the shotgun previously in Bugs's hand enters Toro's body and fills his tail. When he flicks his tail and it hits the ground, a bullet fires from each of his horns, one at a time. Taking advantage of that, Toro chases Bugs, shooting at him, but eventually runs out of bullets. Toro \\"reloads\\" by swallowing several \\"elephant bullets\\" (with explosive heads), but when he attempts to shoot again, he instead explodes. Bugs taunts Toro once again by calling him, among other things, an \\"im-bess- ile\\" and an \\"ultra-maroon\\", but realizes that he is trapped in front of barred gates. As Toro races toward him, Bugs pretends to await certain death (by writing a will and saying his prayers), and at the last second, opens the gates like a garage door, sending Toro out of the bullring and into the horizon. Furious, Toro races back to the bullring, not anticipating that Bugs has laid out on his path a Rube Goldberg–like contraption of axle grease, a ramp, and some platforms. The grease and ramp send Toro airborne over some glue, a sheet of sandpaper, a protruding matchstick, and a barrel of TNT which explodes when Toro flies by. Still in the air and in shock, Toro finally crashes into a wooden bull shield. The cartoon ends with the unconscious bull's hindquarters sticking out of the shield, and the victorious Bugs holding up the cape with the words \\"THE END\\" written on it.  Development  In his biography Chuck Amuck, Chuck Jones claims that he made this cartoon after producer Eddie Selzer burst into Jones' workspace one day and announced, for no readily apparent reason, that there was nothing funny about bullfighting and no cartoons about it were to be made. Since Selzer had, in Jones' opinion, consistently proven himself to be wrong about absolutely everything (having once barred Jones from doing any cartoons featuring Pepé Le Pew, on the grounds that he perceived them as not being funny, which led to Jones and Maltese to do For Scent-imental Reasons, which won an Oscar, which Selzer accepted), the only possible option was to make the cartoon. The sounds of the crowd and the bull are recorded from a genuine bullfighting crowd in Barcelona, Spain. The boulder to the face gag was reused from Rabbit Punch five years earlier, which was also directed by Chuck Jones.

Background Macready was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and graduated from the local Classical High School (1917) and, in 1921, from Brown University, where he was a member of Delta Phi fraternity and won a letter as the football team manager. While in college, Macready sustained a permanent scar on his right cheek after being thrust through the windshield of a Ford Model T when the vehicle skidded on an icy road and hit a telephone pole. He was stitched up by a veterinarian, but he caught scarlet fever during the ordeal. The injury, along with his high brow and perfect diction, gave Macready the Gothic look of an authoritarian or villainous character. Macready first worked in a bank in Providence and was then briefly a newspaperman in New York City before he turned to stage acting. He claimed to have been descended from the 19th century Shakespearean actor William Macready. Acting career =Theatre= Macready made his Broadway debut in a 1926 stage adaptation of The Scarlet Letter. Through 1958, he appeared in fifteen plays, both drama and comedy, including The Barretts of Wimpole Street, based on the family of the English poetess, Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Macready's penchant for acting was spurred in part by the director Richard Boleslawski. His Shakespearean stage credits included Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing (1927), Malcolm in Macbeth (1928) and Paris in Romeo and Juliet (1934). On film, he played Marallus in the 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. He also portrayed Prince Ernst in the original stage version of Victoria Regina (1936), starring Helen Hayes. =Film= Macready's first film was Commandos Strike at Dawn (1942), which starred Paul Muni. In Gilda (1946), Macready's character Ballin Mundson enters a deadly love triangle with characters played by co-stars with Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford. He would again play opposite Ford several years later in the post-war adventure The Green Glove (1952). Stanley Kubrick's anti-war film Paths of Glory (1957) provided Macready with his other great role, self-serving French World War I general Paul Mireau, who is brought down by Kirk Douglas's character, Colonel Dax. He had worked with Douglas previously in Detective Story (1951), and later he appeared with Douglas in two more films: Vincente Minnelli's Two Weeks in Another Town (1962) and John Frankenheimer's Seven Days in May (1964). In 1965, he was cast in a rare comedy role as General Kuhster in Blake Edwards's film The Great Race. One of Macready's last film roles was as United States Secretary of State Cordell Hull in Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970), a depiction of the events leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. =Television= Macready made four guest appearances on Raymond Burr's Perry Mason, including the role of murder victim Milo Girard in the 1958 episode \\"The Case of the Purple Woman.\\" He was also cast regularly in such series as Four Star Playhouse, General Electric Theater, The Ford Television Theatre, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Adventures in Paradise and The Islanders. Macready appeared in many western television series produced in the 1950s and 1960s, including Bat Masterson, Bonanza, The Dakotas, Gunsmoke, Have Gun - Will Travel, The Rebel (once in the role of Confederate General Robert E. Lee), The Rifleman, Lancer, Riverboat, The Rough Riders, Chill Wills's Frontier Circus, The Texan and Steve McQueen's Wanted: Dead or Alive. Also on TV, he was seen in episodes of The Outer Limits, Boris Karloff's Thriller, Kentucky Jones, Get Smart with Don Adams and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. with Robert Vaughn. Macready also portrayed Colonel John Barrington in the 1961 episode \\"Handful of Fire\\" of the NBC Western series Laramie. Macready was cast as Cyrus Canfield, a vengeful father searching for his runaway teenaged daughter, played by Floy Dean, in the May 26, 1962, series finale of NBC's The Tall Man. In the 1960s, Macready performed for three years in the role of Martin Peyton in ABC's Peyton Place, the first prime-time soap opera on American television, with Dorothy Malone in the lead role of Constance MacKenzie. He played publishing magnate Glenn Howard in the TV movie Fame Is the Name of the Game (1966) starring Anthony Franciosa, but was replaced by Gene Barry in the role when the film was subsequently used as the pilot for the television series The Name of the Game with Franciosa, Barry, and Robert Stack revolving in the lead. Personal life An art collector, Macready was a partner with colleague Vincent Price in a Beverly Hills art gallery called The Little Gallery, which they opened in 1943. (Macready had played Price's brother on Broadway in Victoria Regina.) According to Lucy Chase Williams' book The Complete Films of Vincent Price, \\"The establishment merited photos and two full columns in Newsweek magazine, but rent increases forced The Little Gallery to close after two years.\\" Macready married actress Elizabeth Dana Patterson. He was the father of activist Elizabeth Dana Macready, actor/producer Michael Macready, and Marcia Macready. He is the grandfather of gymnast John Macready and 3 other grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren. Death Macready died of emphysema in 1973 and his body was donated to the UCLA School of Medicine.

The brothers wrestled as amateurs at the University of Michigan. The team debuted in 1989, and competed in promotions such as Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), winning in the process eleven world tag team championships and one United States Tag Team Championship, before disbanding in 1998. The brothers reunited on the independent circuit in the early 2000s, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in May 2007. They are the first tag team to hold the WWF World Tag Team Championship, the WCW World Tag Team Championship, and the IWGP Tag Team Championship. The Steiner Brothers are highly regarded as one of the greatest tag teams of all time in professional wrestling history. Professional wrestling career =World Championship Wrestling (1988–1992)= At Starrcade '88 and Chi-Town Rumble, Scott Steiner started to accompany his brother Rick in his matches. Not long after, the brothers started to team up in January 1989. With Missy Hyatt in their corner, the Steiner Brothers were an up-and- coming tag team, mixing technique, power, speed, and agility. They later added Robin Green to the group. With their tremendous win-loss record, they earned a shot at the NWA World Tag Team Championship, held by The Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin). On September 12, 1989, at Clash of the Champions VIII, the Steiners lost when Green tripped Scott, causing him to get DDT'd and pinned by Hayes. Green would transform into Woman, and brought a tag team called Doom to wrestle the Steiners at Halloween Havoc, in which the Steiners lost. On November 1, 1989, in Atlanta, Georgia, the Steiners defeated the Freebirds for the NWA World Tag Team titles; the title change would air on the November 18 episode of World Championship Wrestling. They held the titles until May 19, 1990, when they were defeated by Doom in Washington, D.C. at Capital Combat. The Steiners defeated The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship on August 24, 1990 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. During their title reign, World Championship Wrestling rebranded the championships they owned and controlled, and the title was renamed the WCW United States Tag Team Championship. Upon winning the WCW World Tag Team Championship on February 18, 1991 (the title change aired on the March 9 episode of WCW Pro Wrestling), the Steiners vacated the WCW United States Tag Team Championship on February 20, 1991. They were the second team ever to hold both the WCW World and United States Tag Team titles at once (The Midnight Express tandem of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane were the first team to accomplish that feat in September 1988). After the Steiners won the IWGP Tag Team Championship from Hiroshi Hase and Kensuke Sasaki on March 21, 1991, WCW announcers began referring to them as \\"Triple Crown Champions\\". At the same time, Scott was being groomed as a singles performer. On WCW's weekend TBS shows (WCW Power Hour, WCW Saturday Night, and WCW Main Event). There was a special \\"gauntlet\\" match segment where a performer was picked to wrestle a top star on each show on that weekend, winning the sum of $15,000 USD (kayfabe) if they defeated all three. Scott was the second to run the gauntlet, with his second opponent being Ric Flair. Because the Four Horsemen clumsily interfered, Steiner beat Flair by pinfall. He would then get a title match against Flair at Clash of the Champions XIV: Dixie Dynamite on January 30, 1991, which ended in a time limit draw. and began teasing a heel turn when he teamed with Marcus Bagwell against Steve Austin and Brian Pillman on an Oct 10th, 1992 episode of WCW Worldwide. During the match Bagwell was injured when he was attacked Arn Anderson and when Scott went to tag Bagwell he was unable to. An angry Scott then kicked Bagwell and slammed him into the ring where he was attacked by Austin and Pillman who then won the match. Scott would go on to win the WCW World Television Championship from Ricky Steamboat on October 17, 1992. The heel turn which Scott was undergoing was later aborted upon the Steiner Brothers leaving WCW for the World Wrestling Federation after being lowballed on their contract renewal by then-WCW head Bill Watts. =World Wrestling Federation (1992–1994)= The Steiners left WCW in November 1992, with Scott vacating the WCW World Television Championship. They quickly signed contracts with the World Wrestling Federation, making their televised debut as babyfaces in an interview on the December 21, 1992, edition of WWF Prime Time Wrestling. During their WWF run, emphasis would be placed on their accomplishments at the University of Michigan, including using Michigan's fight song The Victors as their entrance music and wearing Michigan-themed ring attire. They appeared on the debut episode of Monday Night Raw on January 11, 1993. They made their WWF pay-per-view debut on January 24, 1993 at the 1993 Royal Rumble, defeating The Beverly Brothers (Blake and Beau). At WrestleMania IX on April 4, 1993, the Steiner Brothers defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). Following WrestleMania IX, the Steiners began feuding with Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). At King of the Ring 1993 on June 13, 1993, the Steiners and The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart) defeated The Headshrinkers and Money, Inc. The following evening, at the June 14, 1993 television taping, the Steiners defeated Money, Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship in Columbus, Ohio. (The Steiners were still babyfaces in the match despite Columbus being home to Michigan's archrival, Ohio State.) Money, Inc. regained the titles on June 16, 1993 at a house show in Rockford, Illinois, but lost the titles to the Steiners once again at another house show on June 19, 1993 in St. Louis, Missouri. The Steiners successfully defended their titles against The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) on August 30, 1993 at SummerSlam 1993. On the September 13, 1993 episode of Raw in New York City, New York, the Steiners defended their titles against The Quebecers (Jacques and Pierre) in a \\"Province of Quebec rules\\" match, wherein titles can change hands via disqualification. The match ended when the manager of The Quebecers, Johnny Polo, threw a hockey stick into the ring, which was about to be used by Jacques, however, Scott took it away and began to hit him with it as the referee turned around, thus, he disqualified the Steiner Brothers, awarding the title to The Quebecers. Scott gained a measure of revenge by defeating Pierre in a singles match the following week on Raw. At the 1993 Survivor Series on November 24, 1993, the Steiners teamed with Lex Luger and The Undertaker as \\"The All-Americans\\". The All-Americans defeated their opponents, \\"The Foreign Fanatics\\" (Yokozuna, Crush, Ludvig Borga and Jacques), although Luger was the sole survivor. On January 22, 1994, both Steiners entered the 1994 Royal Rumble, with Scott entering at number one. After Rick entered at number three, the brothers cooperated until being eliminated by Owen Hart and Diesel respectively. The Steiners wrestled sparingly after that and eventually left the promotion in mid 1994. Scott appeared last in a King of the Ring qualifier loss to Irwin R. Schyster at the April 13 Superstars of Wrestling taping (which included a run-in from Rick after the match), which aired on May 7. Scott would return to the company in late 2002. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)= The Steiners debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) on July 28, 1995 in the Orange County Fairgrounds in Middletown, New York, defeating Dudley Dudley and Vampire Warrior. They next appeared with ECW in The Flagstaff on August 4, 1995 in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, defeating Dudley Dudley and 2 Cold Scorpio. The Steiner Brothers made their debut in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, ECW Arena on August 5, 1995 at WrestlePalooza 1995, teaming with Eddie Guerrero in a loss to Scorpio, Dean Malenko and Cactus Jack. On August 25, 1995 in Jim Thorpe they defeated Scorpio and Malenko, and they went on to defeat Scorpio and Chris Benoit the following evening. On August 28, 1995, they defeated Dudley Dudley and Dances with Dudley in the Big Apple Dinner Theater in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. At Gangstas' Paradise on September 16, 1995, the Steiners joined forces with Tazz in a loss to The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) and Jason. On September 23, 1995 in Middletown, they defeated Raven and Stevie Richards. Scott made one more appearance (teaming with Taz in a losing effort against The Eliminators on October 28, 1995) before the brothers departed from ECW. =World Championship Wrestling (1996–1998)= The Steiners re-signed with WCW in 1996. They initially feuded with the Road Warriors and had several matches with then champions Sting and Lex Luger. They would eventually win the WCW World Tag Team Championship from Harlem Heat on July 24, 1996, but Harlem Heat would regain the title just three days later and the title changes were never mentioned on TV. A short time later, Scott was sidelined with an injury and Rick had several singles matches until Scott returned to the ring the following January. Following the formation of the New World Order (nWo), the Steiners began feuding with The Outsiders, who had won the WCW World Tag Team Championship from Harlem Heat. The Steiners spent the entirety of 1997 and into 1998 feuding with the duo of Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. They also feuded with other nWo members like Vicious and Delicious and continued to have matches with Harlem Heat. On the August 4, 1997 episode of Nitro The Steiners introduced Ted DiBiase as their new manager, who led them to two tag team championships. =Separation and beyond (1998–2001)= The beginning of Scott's heel turn began in late 1997/early 1998 when he, now with increased muscle mass, having cut his signature mullet, and sporting a goatee, started a feud with Buff Bagwell over who had the better physique, as well as developing a short fuse with his temper. Scott and Rick began having problems teaming up, as Scott would often not tag his brother into matches. The team entered 1998 as the tag team champions, but the dissention caused them to lose the belts. It was not the end of the team's troubles, as Scott would often wrestle a whole match by himself, refuse to tag Rick when he would need to leave the ring, and would often keep the referee distracted with his own antics. On the February 2, 1998 edition of Nitro, things appeared to come to a head when Scott scored the victory in a tag team match against Nash and Bagwell by pinning Bagwell without making a tag to Rick, and Rick screamed and yelled at his brother for his actions. One week later, however, the duo won the WCW World Tag Team Championship again. The final straw came at SuperBrawl VIII on February 22, 1998 when the brothers would face The Outsiders again. Midway through the match, Rick knocked both Hall and Nash out of the ring while both attempted to attack him behind the referee's back and celebrated by running around the ring barking while Scott entered the ring to celebrate with him. Scott then attacked Rick by hitting him in the back, followed by a double underhook powerbomb. Scott then assaulted DiBiase as well, and abandoned his brother to be taken out by Hall and Nash and signified that he was joining the nWo by personally handing Hall and Nash the championship belts himself. The next night on Monday Nitro, he adopted a new gimmick that was somewhat reminiscent of Superstar Billy Graham, dyeing his hair and goatee blond and increasing in muscle mass even further, damaging his agility. The two brothers had a feud that also involved Scott's new partner Buff Bagwell, while Rick teamed with a variety of partners including Kenny Kaos, Lex Luger and Bagwell's mother Judy. Shortly before WCW's demise, the Steiners reunited on August 7, 2000 not so much as a tag team but they were both heels who watched each other's backs. They lost to Kevin Nash and Sting on Monday Night Nitro. On March 5, 2001 they reunited for their last WCW match as a tag team as they lost to Booker T and Diamond Dallas Page on Monday Night Nitro. When WCW closed in March 2001, the two went their separate ways again. Rick would go to wrestle for New Japan Pro Wrestling, World Wrestling All-Stars in 2002, and Total Non-Stop Action in 2003. Later on he went to Pro Wrestling NOAH in Japan between 2004 and 2005. Scott would go to World Wrestling All-Stars in late 2001 and then returned to World Wrestling Entertainment in November 2002. He was released from WWE in August 2004 and then went to the independent circuit and New Wrestling Entertainment in Italy in 2005. =New Japan Pro Wrestling (2002)= The brothers reunited for the first time since the closing of WCW. They wrestled for New Japan Pro Wrestling as Rick was working full-time on the roster. They only wrestled three matches. In May 2002 they defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kensuke Sasaki which the match was refereed by Chyna. On July 19, 2002, they lost to Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono. Then the next day they defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kenzo Suzuki. =Reunions (2005–2009)= The brothers reunited for the Wrestling Fan Xperince in Winnipeg, Manitoba to defeat Buff Bagwell and G-Man on December 6, 2005. On June 2, 2006, Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner & Scott Steiner) defeated Elvis Elliot & Original Sinn at a UCW wrestling show at Bay City Western High School in Auburn, Michigan entitled \\"Steiner Brothers Return Home.\\" They went to United Wrestling Federation in Wilson, North Carolina to defeat the team of Matt Bentley and Frankie Kazarian. They also defeated Team 3D the next night in Wilmington, North Carolina. On December 9, 2006, the Steiners won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship.On January 4, 2008 they returned to New Japan as they lost to the IWGP Tag Team Champions Giant Bernard and Travis Tomko in Tokyo. Then they defeated Bobby Eaton and Ricky Morton at MCW Mayday 2009 in Toccoa, Georgia. On December 13, 2009 they defeated Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm) and (Robert Roode) at PTM Supermacy in Belleville, Michigan. Afterwards the brothers went their separate ways once gain. Rick continued in the independent circuit and mainly wreslted in the Mid-Atlantic area. Scott returned to the indies as well. Also he worked in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Canada. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007–2008)= At the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view Sacrifice 2007, Scott Steiner teamed with Tomko in a Triple Threat Tag Team match. They lost the match and the miscommunication between Steiner and Tomko led Tomko to attack Steiner following the match. Rick Steiner made his return and fought off Tomko, thus reuniting the Steiner Brothers. They were set to face Team 3D at Slammiversary 2007 for their World Tag Team Championship. An injury to Scott's trachea in Puerto Rico, however, put the match in question, until he was replaced by longtime rival Road Warrior Animal. While Scott was out for his injury, Team 3D demanded his return and teased his near-death injury. The duo then appeared and attacked Team 3D at Victory Road, costing them their World Tag Team titles. At Hard Justice, the Steiner Brothers defeated Team 3D. On the August 16 episode of Impact!, the Steiner brothers lost in a Handicap match to Kurt Angle after interference from Team 3D, heating up their feud. At Bound for Glory the Steiner brothers defeated Team 3D in a two out of three falls tables match. The following month at Genesis, the Steiners received a tag team title shot against A.J. Styles and Tomko, but were unsuccessful. On January 29, 2008 however, Rick was released from TNA, breaking up the Steiners once again. Scott left TNA in February 2010 and returned in February 2011. He was released by TNA in March 2012. =Reunions (2012–present)= Before Scott's release from TNA, he reunited with Rick as they lost to The New Age Outlaws (B.G. James and Kip James) refereed by Mick Foley at PWS WrestleReunion IV in Los Angeles on January 28, 2012. On June 23, 2013, The Steiner Brothers defeated Homicide and Eddie Kingston at a House of Hardcore event. On September 21, 2013 The Steiner Brothers reunited at the American Pro Wrestling Alliance defeating Viper and Bulldozer in Shinnston, West Virginia for Frontier Days. They would return to the American Pro Wrestling Alliance again on January 11, 2014 to face former Atlanta Falcon, Moose and APWA World Heavyweight Champion, \\"The Black Superman\\" ONYX. The Steiners were already confirmed for three APWA shows in 2014. On September 6, 2014, The Steiner Brothers reunited in Wichita Falls, Texas for Pure Action Championship Wrestling's Brawl In The Falls III, winning and becoming the promotion's final tag team champions. On October 20, 2014 The Steiner Brothers defeated Dynasty members Jarrod Michaels and Scotty Biggs at SSCW \\"Breaking the Law\\" in Nashville, Georgia. On November 29, 2014, The Steiner Brothers defeated The Rock N' Roll Express, The Faces of Fear and George South and Tom Prichard at WrestleCade 2014. On February 29, 2020 they teamed with a 79 year old Dory Funk Jr. to defeat Blain Rage, Jake Logan, and Shane Chung in a 6 tag at Funk's FC !Bang! promotion in Ocala, Florida.

He was a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the district of Surrey-Cloverdale as a member of the BC Liberals from 2001 to 2013. He served as both the Deputy Premier, and the province's Minister of Finance.\\"Christy Clark sworn in as B.C. premier\\". The Globe and Mail, March 14, 2011.  Personal life  Born in North Vancouver, Falcon worked in insurance after graduating from a private Catholic high school Vancouver College. Falcon holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Simon Fraser University (SFU). He lives in Surrey, British Columbia with his wife Jessica and daughters Josephine and Rose.  Politics  After being involved with the Social Credit (Socred) party in the 1980s, Falcon decided to study political science at SFU. He was a member of the Young Socreds on campus while future Premier Christy Clark was also at SFU. After graduation, he was part of a movement to revitalize the right-wing municipal party in Surrey that saw Doug McCallum upset Bob Bose, the NDP incumbent mayor, in 1996 and the election to council of future mayor Dianne Watts. Falcon then set up a communications consultancy (Access Group) in 1998. His major step into provincial politics was as a lead organizer of the \\"Total Recall\\" effort to recall a number of BC New Democratic Party MLA's in 1999. After replacing incumbent Bonnie McKinnon as the Liberal nominee, he was first elected in 2001 as a BC Liberal to represent the riding of Surrey-Cloverdale, and re-elected in the 2005, and 2009 elections. His first cabinet appointment was in the newly created position of Minister of State for Deregulation which earned kudos from business and industry for cutting government 'red tape.' In January 2009, after police \\"raided\\" the legislature to investigate corruption in the sale of BC Rail, Falcon replaced Judith Reid as Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. As transport minister, Falcon changed the governance structure of TransLink to reduce the oversight by municipal representatives. He also introduced the Gateway Program, a $3 billion regional transportation strategy for Metro Vancouver that launched the construction of the new Port Mann Bridge. In June 2009, Falcon was appointed as Minister of Health. He approved expansion of Surrey Memorial Hospital, pursued new models of shared-services and province-wide purchasing between health authorities, and launched a provincial agency to begin P4P (Pay For Performance funding models. =Eyewear issue= Once Falcon was promoted to Minister of Health, he proposed changes to the health regulations regarding sales of contact lenses and eyeglasses which removed the requirement of a physical inspection of a prescription allowing their sale over the internet, to be effective May 2010.http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2009-2013/2010HSERV0015-000286.htm B.C. MODERNIZES REGULATIONS FOR SALE OF EYEWEAR Amendments to Optometry and Optician Regulations Objections from professional health care associations included concerns that allowing opticians to perform sight tests would result in patients receiving less frequent comprehensive eye exams, and that allowing retailers to dispense eyeglasses and contact lenses without verifying a prescription may result in improperly fitted prescriptions or harmful health effects.http://www.optometrists.bc.ca/upload/documents/Important_New_Regulations/CNIB_Letter_to_Minister_Falcon_080410.pdfhttp://www.optometrists.bc.ca/upload/documents/Important_New_Regulations/BC_AOA_Comments_Regarding_Proposed_Changes_March_31_2010.pdfhttp://www.optometrists.bc.ca/upload/documents/Important_New_Regulations/UW_optometry_BC_letter___FINAL.pdf Political opponents argued that Falcon made these proposals after a $10,000 donation from Clearly Contacts to the BC Liberal Party, and after an email from Clearly Contacts was sent out to eligible voters urging them to join the BC Liberal Party and vote for Falcon as leader. News1130  Leadership campaign  On November 3, 2010, Premier Gordon Campbell announced that he would step down as Premier of British Columbia once his successor was chosen. On November 30, 2010, Falcon launched his campaign to be the leader of the BC Liberal Party, and subsequently the Premier of British Columbia. Falcon is regarded as one of the more conservative members of caucus and was able to secure a large number of supporters from the British Columbia business community. He was also supported by 19 BC Liberal caucus members, one former caucus member and Liberal Party Senator Larry Campbell. On December 11, the Vancouver Sun reported that Falcon's social media traffic was the highest of declared candidates. Throughout the campaign he refused to call for a full public inquiry into the sale of BC Rail and associated scandal, which involved allegations of bribes paid to Liberal insiders. However, he agreed to an investigation into why the government paid $6 million in legal fees for Liberal party aides Robert Virk and David Basi after they pleaded guilty to accepting bribes. On February 26, 2011, Falcon lost his bid to become the Liberal leader, and the province's Premier, to Christy Clark by a margin of 52%-48% in the third round of voting by party members. In 2012, a number of Falcon supporters 'fled' to the BC Conservative party, including former BC Liberal nomination candidate Rick Peterson. Falcon remarked that \\"a number of my supporters that may have done that and I’m not entirely surprised\\".Falcon backers fleet to BC conservatives, Vancouver Sun blog, Feb 20, 2012 Christy Clark, the new Premier, included her main challenger in cabinet by appointing him to the key but also challenging position of Minister of Finance, whose portfolio included rescinding the controversial Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). In August 2012, Falcon stepped down from cabinet and announced he would not run in the 2013 election during the same period where George Abbott (politician) and a number of other Campbell MLAs were dropping out. After politics Falcon returned to the real-estate investment industry as executive vice- president for Anthem Capital. He was also named as an honorary director by the Surrey Board of Trade.

Frybread being cooked in a cast iron skillet during a funeral potlatch in Tanana, Alaska. Frybread (also spelled fry bread) is a flat dough bread, fried or deep-fried in oil, shortening, or lard. Made with simple ingredients, frybread can be eaten alone or with various toppings such as honey, jam, powdered sugar, venison, or beef. Frybread can also be made into tacos, like Navajo tacos. History According to Navajo tradition, frybread was created in 1864 using the flour, sugar, salt and lard that was given to them by the United States government when the Navajo, who were living in Arizona, were forced to make the 300-mile journey known as the \\"Long Walk\\" and relocate to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico, onto land that could not easily support their traditional staples of vegetables and beans, New Mexican cuisine style sopapillas also share this origin due to Pueblos and Hispanos of New Mexico having a similar subsistence at this time. Boarding schools also helped to spread frybread in Native American diets. For many Native Americans, \\"frybread links generation with generation and also connects the present to the painful narrative of Native American history\\". It is often served both at home and at gatherings. The way it is served varies from region to region and different tribes have different recipes. It can be found in its many ways at state fairs and pow-wows, but what is served to the paying public may be different from what is served in private homes and in the context of tribal family relations. Controversy Frybread's significance to Native Americans has been described as complicated and their relationship with it conflicted. Although frybread is often associated with \\"traditional\\" Native American cuisine, some Native American chefs reject it as a symbol of colonialism. Indigenous chef Sean Sherman calls it \\"everything that isn't Native American food\\", writing that it represents \\"perseverance and pain, ingenuity and resilience\\". Frybread became a symbol of resilience as it was developed out of necessity using government-provided flour, sugar, and lard. However, indigenous chefs such as Sherman consider it a symbol of colonial oppression, as the ingredients were being provided because the government had moved the people onto land that could not support growing traditional staples like corn and beans. The journalist and documentary filmmaker Patty Talahongva, who identifies as Hopi of the Corn Clan, calls frybread \\"Die Bread\\" and associates it with diseases endemic to Native Americans, including gallbladder disease, diabetes, and more. She attributes the spread of frybread to boarding schools, like the Phoenix Indian School, which she attended in the late 1970s. She also describes the movement towards indigenous food sovereignty – which promotes healthy foods like corn, beans, and squash, instead of starchy, high-fat foods like frybread – while citing the importance to this effort of Roxanne Swentzell (Santa Clara Pueblo); Winona LaDuke (Ojibwe); Nephi Craig (Apache and Navajo); Loretta Barrett Oden; Sean Sherman (Oglala Lakota); Brian Yazzie (Navajo); and the culinary ethnobotanist Tashia Hart. Nutrition facts The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that a plate of fry bread consists of 700 Calories and 27 grams of fat. Varieties A typical frybread recipe consists of flour, water, salt, a small amount of oil, and baking powder. The ingredients are mixed and worked into a simple dough, and covered with a cloth for 30 minutes to an hour, until the dough rises. It is then formed into small balls, and are either rolled or pulled into flat discs prior to frying in hot oil. Many variations of this basic recipe exist, including substituting mayonnaise for oil in the dough (which produces a crisp, crunchy texture that resists getting soggy - ideal for Navajo tacos), and leavening the dough with a small container of yogurt or soured milk instead of using baking powder or yeast (produces a rich, sourdough flavor but requires several hours to fully leaven after the dough is prepared). Most frybread recipes do not use yeast at all because it was not typically available to Native peoples when this foodstuff was developed. In many Native American households, frybread dough is mixed early in the morning and left in a large bowl covered with a cloth to leaven and is used throughout the day to prepare fresh bread when needed.

It is approximately 6 miles southeast of downtown Biddeford, to which it is connected via State Route 208. The town of Kennebunkport is 3 miles southwest, connected via State Route 9. Background Tristram Goldthwaite House c. 1910 Biddeford Pool is the site of Maine's first recorded permanent settlement, then called Winter Harbor (not to be confused with present-day Winter Harbor, Maine). In the winter of 1616-1617, Richard Vines, a physician, resided here as part of the colonization efforts of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, lord proprietor of Maine. An early village developed on the north side. In 1688, Fort Mary was built near the pool's entrance. Fort Mary, Biddeford Pool, Down East Magazine, Vol. 51, Issue 4, Nov. 2004, p. 76 The former Fletcher's Neck Lifesaving Station, closed in 1971 and on the National Register of Historic Places, still stands at Ocean Avenue and Fourth Street. During World War II the Biddeford Pool Military Reservation was established from 1941 to 1945, on what is now the Abenakee Golf Club. It had four circular concrete platforms called \\"Panama mounts\\" for 155 mm guns, three of which remain today.Article on Biddeford Pool Military Reservation at FortWiki.com From December 1941 to 12 February 1943 it was garrisoned by Battery F of the 240th Coast Artillery of the Maine National Guard; this unit was then relieved by Battery E of the 22nd Coast Artillery, which departed in October 1943; it is unclear what unit was at the site after that time.Gaines, William C., Coast Artillery Organizational History, 1917-1950, Coast Defense Journal, vol. 23, issue 2, p. 15 The small harbor hosts both vacationers and lobstermen. Its water level fluctuates from a large navigable body during high tide to mostly mudflats during low tide. The only exception is the deep mouth, where a gut is located which is naturally dredged by tidal current. It is locally known as \\"The Gut.\\" Consequently, this is the area where most boats are moored. Wood Island Light is located about a mile offshore to the northeast. Biddeford Pool is bounded by the mainland to the south and west, by Hills Beach to the north, and by East Point to the east. The area is a popular summer destination for visitors from as far south as Florida and as far west as California. The pool is surrounded by tall grass salt marshes that are home to a variety of birds and other wildlife. East Point Sanctuary, maintained by the Maine Audubon Society, is considered to be one of the premier birding spots on the northeast coast. Mile Stretch Road, a sandy strip of beach which connects the neighborhood of Biddeford Pool to the mainland, is a notable tombolo.

The team consisted of \\"Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.). They held the WWF Tag Team Championship three times, defeating the Legion of Doom, the Natural Disasters and the Steiner Brothers for the title. In addition they had a feud with the Mega-Maniacs (Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake). After Money Inc. split up, DiBiase and Schyster were reunited in two stables, the Million Dollar Corporation and the New World Order, and have made several television appearances during special episodes of Raw. Career =Formation= Ted DiBiase in 2014 Both DiBiase and Schyster had gimmicks that focused on money. Schyster, whose initials spelled I.R.S., portrayed an evil tax accountant. DiBiase had used the gimmick of an arrogant millionaire in the WWF since 1987. He called himself the \\"Million Dollar Man\\" and created his own championship belt, the Million Dollar Championship. He was involved in angles that included purchasing the WWF Championship, purchasing actual people such as Nikolai Volkoff and Sapphire Sapphire began appearing in segments where she would do favors for DiBiase, including ironing his money. She left the WWF a short time later., and paying wrestlers and fans to perform demeaning tasks. The WWF creative team decided that the two characters fit well together and made the decision to pair them together in late 1991. In February 1992, a storyline began in which Jimmy Hart, who had been managing The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon), turned against his team. In return for a bribe, he gave his team's contract for a WWF Tag Team Championship match against Legion of Doom (LOD) to Money Inc. =Tag Team Championships= alt=Jimmy Hart, holding a megaphone and wearing a white jacket with red stars on it DiBiase and Schyster, managed by Hart, defeated LOD at a house show on February 7, 1992 in Denver, Colorado, to win the title. This title win was unusual for professional wrestling, as Money Inc. had not yet debuted as a team on WWF television programming. In addition, the decision to give the championship belts to Money Inc. was made in a hurry, as LOD's Hawk had failed a drug test. The wrestlers were unaware until that night that the title would change hands, and Money Inc.'s win was not immediately acknowledged on television, as WWF programming was taped in advance. The Natural Disasters, upset by Hart's assistance to a rival tag team, fired Hart as their manager and turned face, beginning a feud with Money Inc. over the WWF Tag Team Championship. Not wanting to carry two championship belts, Ted DiBiase returned the Million Dollar Championship to the WWF, telling an executive that he would no longer appear with the belt. Money Inc. defended their tag team title against The Natural Disasters at WrestleMania VIII on April 5 and lost the match by countout. Because titles can only change hands via pinfall or submission, Money Inc. retained the belts. Over the next few months, the teams faced each other in rematches on television and at house shows, but Money Inc. managed to retain the title. After Hawk's suspension ended, the Legion of Doom was given a rematch against Money Inc. at SummerSlam 1992. The match was promoted as a championship bout, but the Natural Disasters beat Money Inc. for the title a month before the pay-per-view. At SummerSlam on August 29, the Legion of Doom won the match when Animal pinned DiBiase. At the October 13, 1992 Wrestling Challenge taping, Money Inc. faced The Natural Disasters in a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The match originally pitted the Disasters against the Nasty Boys, who were also managed by Hart, but at the last minute, Hart replaced them with Money Inc. Because of this, the Nasty Boys split with Hart and attacked Money Inc. before the match. Later on, the Headshrinkers interfered on behalf of Money Inc. and helped DiBiase make Earthquake submit to the Million Dollar Dream, thereby winning Money Inc. the Championship. After the match, the Nasty Boys again attacked Jimmy Hart. At the 1992 Survivor Series on November 25, Money Inc. and the Beverly Brothers faced the Nasty Boys and the Natural Disasters in an 8-man elimination tag team match. During the match, Money Inc. eliminated the Natural Disasters, but Jerry Sags of the Nasty Boys then pinned I.R.S. to win the match. This was the only major victory The Nasty Boys got over Money Inc., as they failed to win the tag team title in several shots on television and at house shows in late 1992 into early 1993. =Feud with The Mega-Maniacs= Irwin R. Schyster in 1994 On the February 15, 1993 airing of Monday Night Raw, Ted DiBiase wrestled against Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake. Beefcake had sustained a real-life injury to his face in 1990. While Beefcake was wrestling his first match in two and a half years, DiBiase and Schyster attacked him. DiBiase held Beefcake for Schyster to hit him in the face with a briefcase, but Jimmy Hart repeatedly got in the way before Schyster shoved him out of the ring. I.R.S. then hit Beefcake in the face with the briefcase. Hart justified his face turn by claiming that he felt the need to \\"step up and do the right thing\\" and that he \\"had a change of heart\\". Shortly thereafter, Hulk Hogan made his return to WWF television, and he teamed with Beefcake to form The Mega-Maniacs with Hart as their manager. Hogan and Beefcake challenged Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania IX. During the match, the referee sustained a kayfabe injury and was knocked unconscious. Hart jumped into the ring, turned his jacket inside- out to reveal black and white stripes similar to a referee's shirt, and made the three-count to give the match to The Mega-Maniacs. Hogan, Beefcake, and Hart celebrated by opening Schyster's briefcase and throwing his money into the crowd. A second referee then appeared, and the Mega-Maniacs were disqualified because Hogan had used Beefcake's steel face protector as a weapon. =Final Tag Team Championship= Money Inc. feuded with The Steiner Brothers in the spring of 1993. At the 1993 King of the Ring, The Steiner Brothers and The Smokin' Gunns defeated Money Inc. and The Headshrinkers in an 8-man tag team match. The following day, June 14, 1993, the Steiners defeated Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Two days later, Money Inc. regained the titles, only to drop them back to the Steiners three days later. Although Money Inc. received several rematches, they were unable to win the belts back from the Steiners. After failing to regain the WWF Tag Team Championship, Money Inc. began a feud with Razor Ramon. DiBiase had been making fun of Ramon over his upset loss to the 1-2-3 Kid, and even offered Ramon a job as his servant. Ramon was furious with DiBiase and turned face during their feud. Soon after, Ramon distracted DiBiase in a match against the 1-2-3 Kid, causing the Million Dollar Man an embarrassing loss of his own. At SummerSlam 1993, Razor Ramon defeated Ted DiBiase in what would be DiBiase's last WWF match. Later in the event, I.R.S. defeated the 1-2-3 Kid. DiBiase went on a leave of absence for several months, and Schyster returned to singles competition, feuding with Ramon. DiBiase retired from wrestling. Reunions Mike Rotunda, who portrayed Schyster, and Ted DiBiase continue to be close friends in real life, and they have reunited on several occasions following the disbanding of Money Inc. In 1994, DiBiase formed the Million Dollar Corporation, a stable of heel wrestlers. Schyster was one of the first wrestlers to join the group and remained in the stable until leaving the WWF in 1995. In 1996, DiBiase and Rotunda (the latter as V.K. Wallstreet) were briefly together again in World Championship Wrestling as members of the New World Order. Money Inc. made a surprise one-night return at Raw Family Reunion on October 9, 2006. They joined Arn Anderson and Rowdy Roddy Piper to assist Ric Flair, who was facing Mitch. They prevented the rest of Mitch's Spirit Squad from getting involved in the match, helping Flair secure the victory. At the 15th Anniversary special edition of Monday Night Raw on December 10, 2007, Money Inc. had a brief reunion during a 15-man over-the-top-rope battle royal. After I.R.S. was the last man standing out of the 14 wrestlers that made it to the ring, DiBiase came out as the 15th entrant and paid I.R.S. to eliminate himself. As a result, DiBiase was named the winner of the match. They were also reunited on an episode of RAW in 2010 where they fought with fellow legends after a match between DiBiase's son Ted DiBiase and Christian.

Salmon (; né Nathan Salmon Ucuzoglu on January 2, 1951) is an American philosopher in the analytic tradition, specializing in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of logic.  Life and career  Salmon was born January 2, 1951 in Los Angeles to a working-class family of Sephardi Jews of Spanish-Turkish heritage. He is the grandson of archivist Emily Sene (née Emily Perez) and oud player Isaac Sene. Salmon attended Lincoln Elementary School in Torrance, California through eighth grade, where he was a classmate and friend of the child prodigy, James Newton Howard. Salmon graduated from North High School (Torrance) in 1969. The first person in his family to go to college, Salmon graduated from El Camino College (1971) and from the University of California, Los Angeles (B.A. 1973, M.A. 1974, Ph.D. 1979). At UCLA he studied with Tyler Burge, Alonzo Church, Keith Donnellan, Donald Kalish, David Kaplan, Saul Kripke, and Yiannis Moschovakis. Salmon was assistant professor of philosophy at Princeton University from 1978 to 1982. In 1984, the Council of Graduate Schools awarded him the Gustave O. Arlt Award in the Humanities, for his book, Reference and Essence (1981), which was based on his UCLA doctoral dissertation. His second book, Frege's Puzzle (1986), was selected by Scott Soames for a literary website as one of the best five books on the philosophy of language.Scott Soames, \\"Best Five Books on the Philosophy of Language,\\" The Browser, October 15, 2010. The other selections are monographs by Noam Chomsky, Gottlob Frege, David Kaplan, and Saul Kripke. Salmon is currently Distinguished Professor of philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and has been teaching there since 1984. He has also taught at UCLA, the University of California, Riverside, the University of Southern California, and was a regular visiting distinguished professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center from 2009 to 2012.  Philosophical work  =Direct reference theory= Salmon is a proponent of the theory of direct reference. Salmon has provided accounts both of propositional attitudes and of Frege's puzzle about true identifications, i.e., truths of the form \\"a = b\\".In his books, Frege's Puzzle and Content, Cognition, and Communication. Salmon maintains that co-designative proper names are inter-substitutable with preservation of semantic content. Thus, on his view the sentence \\"Samuel Clemens was witty\\" expresses exactly the same content as \\"Mark Twain was witty\\", whether or not the competent user of these sentences recognizes it. Therefore, a person who believes that Mark Twain was witty ipso facto believes that Samuel Clemens was witty, even if he or she also believes, inconsistently, that Clemens was not witty. Salmon argues that this is made palatable by recognizing that to believe a proposition is to be cognitively disposed in a particular manner toward that proposition when taking it by means of some proposition-guise or other, and that one may be so disposed relative to one proposition-guise while not being so disposed relative to another. Salmon applies this apparatus to solve a variety of famous philosophical puzzles, including Frege's puzzle, Kripke's puzzle about so-called de dicto belief, and W. V. O. Quine's puzzle about de re belief. For example, Quine describes a scenario in which Ralph believes that Ortcutt is no spy, yet Ralph also believes that the man in the brown hat is a spy, when unbeknownst to Ralph the man in the hat is none other than Ortcutt. Under these circumstances, is Ortcutt believed by Ralph to be a spy? The grounds for an affirmative or negative judgment seem equally balanced. On Salmon's account Ortcutt is believed by Ralph to be a spy, since Ralph is appropriately cognitively disposed toward the proposition about Ortcutt that he is a spy when taking that proposition by means of one proposition-guise, even though Ralph is not so disposed relative to an alternative, equally relevant proposition-guise.\\"Propositional Attitude Reports\\" =Existence= Salmon provided direct-reference accounts of problems of nonexistence and of names from fiction.See, e.g., Metaphysics, Mathematics, and Meaning, Oxford University Press, 2005. Salmon argues, directly contrary to Immanuel Kant,Critique of Pure Reason book II c.3 sec. 5, A598, B626. that existence is a property, one that particular individuals have and other individuals lack. According to Salmon, the English verb \\"exist\\" is (along with its literal translations into other languages), among other things, a term for this alleged property, and a sentence of the form \\"a exists\\" is true if and only if the subject term designates something with the property, and is false (and \\"a does not exist\\" is true) if and only if the subject term designates something with the complementary property of nonexistence. Thus Russell's example, \\"The present king of France exists\\", is neither true nor false, since France is not presently a monarchy, and therefore \\"the present king of France\\" does not designate; whereas \\"Napoleon exists\\" is simply false, since although Napoleon once existed, the moment he died he took on the property of nonexistence. By contrast, Salmon maintains that \\"Sherlock Holmes exists\\" is literally true, whereas \\"Sherlock Holmes was a detective\\" is literally false. According to Salmon, Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character, a kind of abstract entity, created by author Arthur Conan Doyle, and the fiction is a story, or a collection of stories, which are about that very character but are literally false. Holmes really exists, but is only depicted as a detective in the fiction. In the fiction, Holmes is a detective; in reality, Holmes is merely a fictional detective. Salmon extends this view to what he calls mythical objects, like the hypothetical planet, Vulcan. Vulcan really exists, but it is not a real planet. It is an abstract entity that is only depicted as a planet in the myth. Salmon's account of fiction and myth thus has direct application to the philosophy of religion. Salmon has also applied his account of mythical objects to Peter Geach's famous problem of uncovering the logical form of the particular sentence, \\"Hob thinks a witch has blighted Bob's mare, and Nob wonders whether she (the same witch) killed Cob's sow\\". Salmon's account shows how the problematic sentence can be true even though there are no witches, and even if Hob and Nob do not know about each other, and there is no one whom they think is a witch. Salmon thinks, again contrary to Kant, that it is perfectly legitimate to invoke existence in a term's definition. Thus \\"God\\" might be legitimately defined as the conceivable individual that is divine and also exists. According to Salmon, the ontological argument for God's existence fallaciously assumes that \\"The F is F\\" is a truth of logic, or an analytic truth. What is true by logic is a significantly weaker variant: \\"If anything is uniquely F, then the F is F\\". The strongest conclusion that validly follows from the proposed definition is that if any conceivable individual actually is uniquely both divine and existent, then God actually exists. This same conclusion is also a trivial logical consequence of the atheist's contention that no conceivable individual actually is uniquely both divine and existent. According to Salmon's critique, the ontological argument thus shows nothing. = Semantics and pragmatics= Salmon argues that natural-language sentences that are representable as λ-converts of one another (in the sense of Church's lambda-calculus) are, although logically equivalent by λ-conversion, typically not strictly synonymous, i.e., they typically differ in semantic content—as for example \\"a is large and also a is seaworthy\\" and \\"a is a thing that is both large and seaworthy\\". Salmon maintains a sharp division between semantics and pragmatics (speech acts). He argues that in uttering a sentence, a speaker typically asserts a good deal more than the words' semantic content, and that, consequently, it is a mistake to identify the semantic content of a sentence with what is said by its speaker. Salmon maintains that such an identification is an instance of a mistaken form of argument in the philosophy of language, \\"the pragmatic fallacy.\\"\\"Propositional Attitude Reports\\". =Essentialism= Salmon is also known in metaphysics for, among other things, his analysis of arguments for essentialism—the doctrine that some properties of things are properties that those things could not fail to have (except perhaps by not existing). In particular, Salmon is known for his development and defense of a reductio ad absurdum argument, using a sorites-like problem (slippery slope), against nearly universally accepted modal logic systems S4 and S5, which he argues commit \\"the fallacy of necessity iteration,\\" sanctioning the invalid inference from the observation that a proposition p is a necessary truth to the conclusion that it is a necessary truth that p is a necessary truth. He defends his view by exposing a mistake in a standard argument favoring S5, while arguing that there are not only possible worlds—thought of as maximal scenarios that might have obtained—but in addition classically consistent impossible worlds: maximal scenarios that could not obtain.\\"Natural Kinds\\" =Identity= Salmon also provided a controversial reductio ad absurdum \\"disproof\\" of indeterminate identity, i.e., the philosophically popular idea that for some pairs of things there is no fact of the matter concerning whether those things are one and the very same. Salmon argues that if there were such a pair of things, x and y, then this pair would have to be different from the reflexive pair of x with itself, since there is a fact concerning whether x and x are the same. It would then follow by set theory that x and y are not the same, and in that case there would be a fact of the matter after all concerning whether x and y are the same: they are not. Therefore, there cannot be a pair of things for which there is no fact concerning their identity. On the other hand, Salmon maintains that not all vagueness is due to language and some indeterminacy results from how things themselves are, i.e., that for some things and some attributes, independently of language, there is no fact of the matter concerning whether those things have those attributes. Critics of Salmon's alleged proof acknowledge that the highlighted difference between and —that there is a fact whether the elements of the latter, but not of the former, are the same thing—is genuine, but respond that it does not validly support the conclusion that those pairs are not the same.

He was often credited as S. Tulikov in his musical works and his cameo appearance in Russian television series. Serafim Tulikov is known for his patriotic and officially ideological compositions.Заложение памятной звезды Серафима Туликова Early years Serafim Tulikov was born in Kaluga, western Russia, to the family of bookkeeper Grigoriy Boboedov. Both parents of Serafim were active in choirs during their youth, and Serafim was deeply immersed in music during his childhood. He was eventually enrolled into the Kaluga Academy of Music, and at the age of 18, he studied at many conservatoires in Russia. A promising composer During the mid-1940s Serafim Tulikov composed a range of melodious lyrical-patriotic songs which became quite popular, for instance, \\"The Kursk Nightingale\\" (\\"Курский соловей\\"), with lyrics by Olga Fadeeva. The majority of these songs celebrated the return of peaceful life to war-torn Russia. Tulikov was also heavily influenced by the post-war trend in Soviet popular music towards increasingly archaic and folkloristic imagery and melodic formulas, for instance, in songs such as \\"They have come for a sojourn\\" (\\"Приезжали на побывку\\") (lyrics by Yakov Belinsky), \\"Moscow the Capital\\" (\\"Москва-столица\\"), and \\"Blossom, my Homeland!\\" (\\"Цвети, наш край\\")(lyrics by Sergei Vasiliev). National fame came to Tulikov in 1947, when he composed \\"We Are for Peace\\" (\\"Мы - за мир!\\"), with lyrics by , a marching song meant to mobilize the masses all over the world on behalf of the USSR-led effort to prevent the escalation of international tensions during the early phase of the Cold War. In 1951, Tulikov composed \\"March of the Soviet Youth\\" (\\"Марш советской молодежи\\") (lyrics by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky) which received the First Prize at the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students held in East Berlin. This march continued and developed the pattern established by the composer in \\"We Are for Peace!\\"; unbridled optimism, mass-mobilizing appeal, and sunny imagery. The initial version of the \\"March of the Soviet Youth\\" contained the following words: \\"Our youth carry love for their Great Leader in their hearts! Stalin is leading us into the future! The path he has chosen for us is the right one!\\" After Nikita Khrushchev's \\"de-Stalinization\\" campaign in 1956, these words were duly replaced. Throughout most the 1950s, Tulikov continued to compose for all sorts of official ideological occasions, including Communist Party of the Soviet Union congresses, youth festivals, and professional conventions. Tulikov's style of optimism found its expression in such songs as \\"This is Us, the Youth!\\" (\\"Это мы, молодежь\\")(lyrics by Lev Oshanin), written on the occasion of the 5th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Warsaw in 1955, \\"My Beloved Motherland\\" (\\"Родина любимая моя\\") (lyrics by Andrei Dostal), dedicated to the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution in 1957. With time, Tulikov's style of mass-marching songs had undergone some substantial changes. In the beginning his marches were dynamic and energetic, strongly influenced by the mass songs of Isaak Dunayevsky, but by the late 1950s, Tulikov's marches became more solemn, more static and more hymnal, as in \\"My Beloved Motherland\\". In his more lyrical songs of his early career, Tulikov developed his style of heartfelt and quiet melodies. Such songs include \\"My Love, my Life\\" (\\"Жизнь моя, любовь моя\\") (lyrics by Anton Prishelets), \\"I Love You, my Sea\\" (\\"Я люблю тебя, море\\") (lyrics by Anatoly Salnikov), \\"Above the Moscow River\\" (\\"Над Москвою-рекой\\") (lyrics by Lev Kondyrev), and \\"Golden Altai\\" (\\"Алтай золотой\\") (lyrics by Tsezar Solodar). The composer also made his contribution to a subgenre of the Soviet song, the army song. He authored a song dedicated to the Soviet Pacific Fleet, \\"Above the Bleak Kuriles Range\\" (\\"Над серой Курильской грядою\\") (lyrics by Nikolai Bukin), a work which combined elements of heroic devotion to the Motherland with pensiveness and longing for the far-away family and its comforts. In reflecting on the sources of inspiration for his songs, Serafim Tulikov later confessed that it came mostly from the reminiscences of his homeland, Kaluga, and most of the elements within the songs were present in Kaluga. In the early 1960s, Tulikov would write a song dedicated to Kaluga, properly entitled \\"The Town of My Youth\\" (\\"Город юности моей\\") (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky), a sweet and unassuming yet sincere and heartfelt song. During Khrushchev's Virgin Lands Campaign of bringing the vast steppes of Kazakhstan and South Siberia into agricultural use, Tulikov composed another well known song, \\"Komsomol Direction\\" (\\"Комсомольская путевка\\") (lyrics by Tsezar Solodar), which declared: \\"On the go! On the go! The Komsomol direction calls us! And the merry song at the threshold sees us off forward!\\"  Mature phase  Many of the older generation of Soviet composers did not feel particularly comfortable after the onset of the television age in the 1960s. Serafim Tulikov adjusted himself, and established himself as one of the leading and most popular Soviet song-writers.) His repertoire, as well as the stylistic forms he used, expanded significantly. On the one hand, Tulikov composed such near-hymnal solemn songs as \\"Lenin is Forever with You\\" (lyrics by Lev Oshanin), perhaps one of the most successful and widely known Soviet songs dedicated to Vladimir Lenin, and \\"Motherland\\" (lyrics by Yuri Polukhin). On the other hand, he wrote songs which clearly carried in themselves an imprint of the cultural thaw of the 1960s, such as \\"Smile!\\" (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky), \\"Equation with One Unknown\\" (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky), and \\"This will Never Be Repeated\\" (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky) These contained no explicit elements of ideology or patriotism, and they were decidedly divorced from the folkloristic tradition in which the majority of Tulikov's lyrical songs of the 1940s-50s were rendered. Tulikov continued to contribute mass songs dedicated to various important events in Soviet history and politics. His song \\"To the Distant Planets!\\" (lyrics by Yuri Polukhin) was a work of optimism designed to celebrate the USSR's technological breakthroughs. Unsurprisingly, it was written in the wake of Yuri Gagarin's first space journey in 1961. In 1964, Tulikov's only opera, Barankin, bud' chelovekom, premiered in Moscow. In the late 1960s Tulikov began to compose songs with overtly neo-Slavophile overtones. They were all dedicated to Russia, yet were different from his previous patriotic style. They became explicitly more folkloristic and filled with rural and natural imagery, such as Russia's meadows, fields, sky, lakes and rivers. The elements of wistfulness and even light sadness, as if bidding farewell to something destined to extinction, became more and more prominent. Examples of this period include \\"There, Far Away is my Russia\\" (lyrics by Vladimir Kharitonov), \\"Love Confession\\" (lyrics by Mikhail Tanich), \\"Treasure Russia\\" (lyrics by Oleg Miliavsky), and \\"My Native Homeland\\" (lyrics by Peter Gradov). Tulikov continued to write songs dedicated to the Soviet Army, its exploits and traditions, such as \\"Veterans' Souls Do Not Age\\" (lyrics by Yakov Belinsky), which became popular with the USSR leadership, itself composed of many who actively participated in the Great Patriotic War, and \\"The Son of Russia\\" (lyrics by Vladimir Kharitonov). Tulikov became notorious for composing multiple songs about Lenin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. For instance, an incredibly pompous and anthem-like song \\"I Sing of My Motherland\\" (lyrics by Nikolai Dorizo) was dedicated to the opening of the 26th Party Congress in 1981. The song praised the strength and the global mission of the Soviet state and pointed out that this strength was not based on fear and intimidation but rather on genuine achievements and generosity of the Soviet people. In the early 1960s Tulikov wrote a very successful song about Moscow, \\"I sing of you, my Moscow\\" (lyrics by Yuri Polukhin). The phrase \\"Moscow, your fame is flying on the wings of your glory all over the world! Moscow, you are the heart of my Motherland!\\" became legendary. In the 1970s, Tulikov contributed several songs to the project of constructing the Baykal-Amur Mainline railway, launched by the Soviet government in 1974-75. The \\"BAM Waltz\\" (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky) became perhaps the most famous of these songs.  Assessment  As the Soviet Union unravelled in the late 1980s, Serafim Tulikov found himself increasingly isolated and ill-equipped to deal with the change. Tulikov's traditionalism, as well as his penchant for slow-flowing and sweet lyrical tunes, was sharply at odds with the newly fashionable avant-garde and radical rejection of harmony and tranquility in music, in favor of cacophony and wild rhythms. Tulikov gradually faded away from public prominence. He died in retirement in 2004. Some of his musical legacy has been resurrected by the lovers of Soviet music. However, the majority of what has been reissued and revived has been Tulikov's most non- political, light lyrical music of the 1960s-70s.Детская школа искусств № 2 References External links *Biography on the website Yandex.

Psychologically, the first Saturn return is seen as the time of reaching full adulthood, and being faced, perhaps for the first time, with adult challenges and responsibilities. In Western astrology The phenomenon is described by Western astrologers as influencing a person's life development at roughly 29.5 year intervals , though the planetary influence may be felt for a few years before the exact conjunction, and variable orbits of the planets can also make the time period longer or shorter . These intervals or \\"returns\\" coincide with the approximate time it takes the planet Saturn to make one orbit around the sun, roughly 29.5 years. Western astrologers believe that, as Saturn \\"returns\\" to the degree in its orbit occupied at the time of birth, a person crosses over a major threshold and enters the next stage of life. With the first Saturn return, a person leaves youth behind and enters adulthood. With the second return, maturity. And with the third and usually final return, a person enters wise old age. These periods are estimated to occur at roughly the ages of 27–31, 56–60 and 84–90. A fourth return — for those who live to see the age of 114–118— is sufficiently rare that it is not given coverage in the astrological literature.

He is one of only three dental officers to have received the medal, the others being Alexander Gordon Lyle and Ben L. Salomon. Biography A Chicago native, Weedon Osborne graduated from Northwestern University Dental School in 1915. He was appointed a U.S. Navy Dental Surgeon with the rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade, on May 8, 1917. He was assigned duty with the 6th Marine Regiment on March 26, 1918. During the Battle of Belleau Wood, Osborne's unit participated in the advance on Bouresches, France, about a mile southeast of Belleau Wood. Osborne sought to aid the wounded during the battle and was killed while attempting to carry an injured officer to safety on June 6, 1918. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions on that day. Weedon Osborne was 25 years old at the time of his death. He was buried in Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, Belleau, Aisne, France. Osborne's Medal of Honor, a rare \\"Tiffany Cross\\" version, is held by the U.S. Navy Museum in Washington, D.C. The museum acquired the medal in 2003 from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which had confiscated it the year before after someone had attempted to sell the medal in South Carolina. It is illegal to sell a Medal of Honor within the United States. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Lieutenant, Junior Grade, (Dental Corps), U.S. Navy.

DiBiase had retired from active competition after a back injury in a match for All Japan Pro Wrestling in late 1993 and was brought back by the WWF as a manager. History =Beginning (1994)= The group's foundation was laid on the May 16, 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw when Ted DiBiase announced that he had purchased the services of Nikolai Volkoff. Volkoff had fallen on hard times, and DiBiase took advantage by forcing him to be his servant in order for Volkoff to provide for his family. This included Volkoff wearing a tuxedo T-shirt as well as trunks that read \\"Property of the Million Dollar Man\\" along with cent signs, as opposed to the dollar signs DiBiase had worn on his trunks. Over the next couple of months, DiBiase acquired Bam Bam Bigelow as well as former tag team partner Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.). Another infamous addition was made early on, when DiBiase claimed to be bringing The Undertaker back to the WWF after a long absence. On the June 11 episode of Superstars a man looking and sounding like The Undertaker was produced by DiBiase. Initially, announcers accepted DiBiase's claim, but eventually his man (wrestler Brian Lee) was revealed to be a doppelgänger. After a main event showdown with \\"the real Undertaker\\" at SummerSlam 1994, the Million Dollar Man's version was not seen again. Also at SummerSlam 1994, the Corporation gained another member. For weeks, the WWF had teased a heel turn by Lex Luger as DiBiase's men constantly interfered in matches on his behalf and offered him bribes to join the stable. His tag team partner at the time, Tatanka, became suspicious and challenged him to a match, only to turn and join himself after DiBiase distracted Luger to set up the pin. King Kong Bundy joined the group in October. At the 1994 Survivor Series, Corporation members Bundy, Bigelow and Tatanka teamed with The Heavenly Bodies to defeat a team captained by Lex Luger in an elimination tag team match. =Expansion (1995–1996)= Bam Bam Bigelow teamed with Tatanka to challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the team's loss in a tournament final to determine new champions, Bigelow became involved in a worked altercation with football legend Lawrence Taylor at ringside. The two squared off in the main event of WrestleMania XI, where Taylor was victorious. After his loss to Taylor, relations soured between Bigelow and DiBiase, cooling for months until the former turned face and saved then-WWF Champion Diesel from a beating at the hands of the Corporation. Throughout 1995, the Corporation continued to feud with the WWF's top faces, including The Undertaker, Luger, Diesel, and Razor Ramon. To help fight off The Undertaker, DiBiase recruited Kama, who stole The Undertaker's urn and had it melted down into a gold chain for himself. In a memorable series of skits, IRS traveled to a graveyard in order to \\"leave no stone unturned\\" in his investigation of dead tax cheats, and to psych out The Undertaker. Undertaker would defeat IRS at the Royal Rumble and then King Kong Bundy at WrestleMania XI. DiBiase added Sycho Sid after Sid turned on Shawn Michaels following WrestleMania XI, and later added The 1-2-3 Kid during Sid's feud with Razor Ramon. However, one by one the Million Dollar Corporation began to disband as its members found themselves out of work. Bundy and IRS left the WWF in 1995, while Kama and Tatanka lasted until early 1996. The 1-2-3 Kid lasted until May 1996, while Sycho Sid entered a temporary retirement due to a severe neck injury. During the 1995 Christmas season, DiBiase added Xanta Klaus, a twisted take on Santa Claus, who hailed from the South Pole and reveled in taking from people rather than giving. However, the character lasted only a few appearances before being dropped. DiBiase, with nobody left to manage, was paired with former WCW star Steve Austin, who was given the name \\"The Ringmaster\\" and awarded the Million Dollar Championship by DiBiase, who also taught Austin his finishing move, the Million Dollar Dream. Although \\"The Ringmaster\\" name was dropped quickly and Austin adopted the \\"Stone Cold\\" moniker he later made famous, he continued to be managed by DiBiase and regarded as the Million Dollar Champion. DiBiase managed Austin through a feud with Savio Vega, where Austin won at WrestleMania XII after a belt shot with the Million Dollar Championship. Vega and Austin had a rematch at In Your House: Beware of Dog 2 in a strap match. Per the stipulation of that match, Vega would have had to become DiBiase's chauffeur if Austin won but DiBiase would be forced to leave the company if Vega won, which he did. Austin claimed he had lost on purpose in order to rid himself of DiBiase, beginning a character transition for Austin while providing a storyline reason for DiBiase's departure; DiBiase had signed with rival promotion World Championship Wrestling shortly before this and debuted with the company later in 1996 as the financier for the nWo.

It borders Ecuador on the north and northeast, Huancabamba Province and Morropón Province on the south, and the Piura and Sullana provinces on the west. This province is located in the western Andes and its capital is the town of Ayabaca, which is the highest in the whole region. Two bus companies cover the route Piura-Sullana-Ayavaca. The trip takes from 5 to 6 hours approximately. The province has a large border with Ecuador, and the oriental branch of the Pan-American Highway crosses the Suyo district, at the north of the province, connecting Piura, Sullana and Las Lomas with the Ecuadorian cities of Macará and Loja. Etymology The name Ayabaca, also written as Ayavaca, derives from two Quechua roots: aya, related to death, but also to immortality; and huaca connected to sanctuaries and sacred places. Some local monographs have limited its meaning to that of \\"grave and ancient tomb of the dead\\" (\\"tumba de muertos\\"). They believe this meaning suggests the name was derived from a site with ancient bones and primitive weapons found near the zone where the Spaniards gathered the native population in 1571, when they founded the first \\"Pueblo de Indios de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Ayavaca\\" or missioni Ayavaca Vieja. Such bones and weapons may be the \\"remains of hordes fallen in combat against the expansionist advance of the Incas\\". Aya does not mean only a deceased or ancestor in the physical sense of the corpse or skeleton, but also in the symbolic and spiritual sense of the soul, consciousness and energy that departs the body, temporarily at night and definitely at the end of the life, but continues circulating in all vital processes, as the cycles of water, light and seasons, that move along with the Earth. With that association, aya is also related to the pale red or yellowish colors of twilight and of dawn, as well as to the paleness of newborns and dying persons. Huaca is the name of sacred places or objects. In this sense, the old sanctuary of Ayavaca or Ayahuaca, situated in the western extreme of the mountain range of the Andes, an area where all regional rivers have their sources, is properly the Sanctuary of Death, but also of Immortality, of life’s changes and creative transformation. Tourist attractions One of Ayavaca's most important attractions is near Aypate, a site known as the Inca construction, about east of the province's capital. The Inca work is located on, or in front of, an ancient pre-Inca sanctuary. In 1996, the regional office of the National Institute of Culture recognized Aypate as the \\"Archaeological Capital of Piura\\". The name of Aypate (also Aypache or Allpachí), also identifies an important legendary figure considered a founding father in the history of this region. The legend describes the beginning of a golden age after a human triumph in understanding and conquering nature without harming it. Different places of the province have other evidence of ancient cultures, including petroglyphs (at El Toldo, Samanga), megalithic altars (Chocán, Montero), and remainders of the Qhapaq Ñan or Inca road. Ayavaca has a multiplicity of landscapes that encompass zones of dry forest and areas of almost permanent humidity located in the mountain range, a region of páramos, lakes and humid forests that supply the main freshwater sources of all the Piura region. Some of these lakes are the Laguna Prieta, near Huamba and Samanga; the Lagunas Arrebiatadas, an assembly of lakes connected in descending levels; the Laguna del Cristal, El Cántaro, and the lake of Santa Clara or Siete Poderes. Likewise, in the large mountain area shared by the provinces of Ayavaca and Huancabamba, there is a great assembly of lakes locally known as The Huarinjas or Huaringas. One is the very important Laguna del Rey, (Lake of the King or Lake of the Inca King), the highest one in the sierra of Piura, in the district of Pacaipampa. Capital The provincial capital is the city of Ayavaca, located at of altitude, with a cold, healthy climate. Its Spanish foundation dates to 1571, when the missionaries gathered the local indigenous population to create the mission village of \\"Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Ayavaca\\". The city has developed as the center of a great religious devotion, dedicated to Jesus Christ under the name of Señor Cautivo (Captive Lord). It is represented in the figure of an \\"Ecce Homo\\", which might have been inspired by the figure of Christ of Medinaceli, Spain, or by local religious traditions, or syncretic combination of both. The festival of the Señor Cautivo, whose central day is October 13, attracts numerous pilgrims from many different zones of north Peru, as well as from Ecuador and Colombia. Some pilgrims walk about from Tacna, in the south of Peru, making their pilgrimage the most extended one known on the South American continent. A secondary festival of the Señor Cautivo is conducted on January 1. Peasants from the Piura coast and valleys approach the sanctuary to petition for water or to express gratitude for the rains.

This approach has been known since at least the mid-1980s in robotics, where it has been called a meadow map, and was popularized in video game AI in 2000. Description A navigation mesh is a collection of two-dimensional convex polygons (a polygon mesh) that define which areas of an environment are traversable by agents. In other words, a character in a game could freely walk around within these areas unobstructed by trees, lava, or other barriers that are part of the environment. Adjacent polygons are connected to each other in a graph. Pathfinding within one of these polygons can be done trivially in a straight line because the polygon is convex and traversable. Pathfinding between polygons in the mesh can be done with one of the large number of graph search algorithms, such as A*. Agents on a navmesh can thus avoid computationally expensive collision detection checks with obstacles that are part of the environment. Representing traversable areas in a 2D-like form simplifies calculations that would otherwise need to be done in the \\"true\\" 3D environment, yet unlike a 2D grid it allows traversable areas that overlap above and below at different heights. The polygons of various sizes and shapes in navigation meshes can represent arbitrary environments with greater accuracy than regular grids can. Creation Navigation meshes can be created manually, automatically, or by some combination of the two. In video games, a level designer might manually define the polygons of the navmesh in a level editor. This approach can be quite labor intensive. Alternatively, an application could be created that takes the level geometry as input and automatically outputs a navmesh. It is commonly assumed that the environment represented by a navmesh is static – it does not change over time – and thus the navmesh can be created offline and be immutable. However, there has been some investigation of online updating of navmeshes for dynamic environments. History In robotics, using linked convex polygons in this manner has been called \\"meadow mapping\\", coined in a 1986 technical report by Ronald C. Arkin. Navigation meshes in video game artificial intelligence are usually credited to Greg Snook's 2000 article \\"Simplified 3D Movement and Pathfinding Using Navigation Meshes\\" in Game Programming Gems. In 2001, J.M.P. van Waveren described a similar structure with convex and connected 3D polygons, dubbed the \\"Area Awareness System\\", used for bots in Quake III Arena.

The station is owned by Comunicación XERSA, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican broadcast company. 49 percent of the concessionaire is owned by an American company, Local Media of San Diego, which holds the right to use the frequency and programs the station from studios in the Sorrento Valley neighborhood of San Diego, along with two other Mexican FM stations broadcasting in English, Alternative Rock-formatted XETRA- FM and Rhythmic AC-formatted XHRM-FM. LMSD also wholly owns U.S.-licensed KFBG.Z90.com/contact XHITZ-FM's 100,000-watt transmitter and antenna are on Mount San Antonio in Tijuana. Because of this, it must abide by all Mexican broadcast regulations, including mandatory public service announcements, political coverage, and the compulsory airings of La Hora Nacional (\\"The National Hour\\") on Sunday nights, and the Mexican National Anthem at midnight and 5:00 a.m. nightly. XHITZ also airs the Top 40/CHR version of \\"Sunday Night Slow Jams\\", which begins at 11:00 p.m., after \\"La Hora Nacional.\\" It is one of two San Diego/Tijuana affiliates for the program, the other being sister station XHRM-FM, which carries the main version. History In September 1970, the station signed on as XHIS-FM, more than three years before receiving its concession in November 1973. It was owned by Víctor Díaz, the founder of Califórmula Broadcasting, which would come to own and operate numerous stations in the San Diego-Tijuana radio market. However, it signed on with a brokered radio format from the United States. Time Sales, Inc., owned by radio automation pioneer Paul Schafer, and presented a jockless progressive rock format known as \\"HIS Radio\\". Time Sales added a second Mexican station when 100.1 XHERS-FM (now 104.5 XHLTN-FM), a soft rock station known as \\"HERS Radio\\", signed on in December, and a third, XHQS-FM 95.7 \\"OURS\\", was also planned. Aside from the music, HIS Radio featured parodies of commercials and a satirical radio novel, the O.B. Ranger. The operation was run by Larry Shushan, a former owner of KPRI FM radio and one of the builders of KAAR, San Diego's first UHF television station. XHIS and XHERS broadcast from a new facility in Tijuana with custom-built 100,000-watt transmitters, throwing maximum power at San Diego. These were the first border blasters on FM. Programming originated from Time Sales's studios and sales offices at the Royal Inn at the Wharf and was transported by cassette to the transmitter, as the Brinkley Act prevented a live hookup from being used. Within six months, Time Sales had two of the top three stations in San Diego. By 1973, however, the tides had turned for Time Sales. San Diego broadcasters complained of disloyal competition across the border that didn't have to play by the Federal Communications Commission's rules for radio stations and decried the promotion of XHIS and XHERS as \\"San Diego stations\\" not using the X in their call signs. The FCC opened an investigation into Time Sales, Schafer and Shushan, resulting in mounting legal fees. Ultimately, Time Sales folded, and Díaz began operating the station under the brand \\"Estéreo 90, La Buena Onda\\". By 1975, XHIS was broadcasting soul music and R&B.; Ironically, it was more popular with teens and women than with men. A 1981 row between Califórmula and politically motivated broadcast workers temporarily forced Díaz out of the broadcasting business. In April, a report had aired on one of the Califórmula stations criticizing Baja California Governor Roberto de la Madrid. Just two weeks after returning to an R&B; format, in September, workers affiliated to the Union of Radio and Television Industry Workers (STIRT) went on strike, and the only way to resolve the strike was to sell XHIS and XHERS to Francisco Aguirre, founder of Mexico City broadcaster Grupo Radio Centro. The Tijuana acquisition marked GRC's first ever expansion outside the capital city. Two years later, Díaz bought back the cluster of XHIS and XHERS, instituting new call signs and formats on both. That year, XHIS became XHITZ-FM and changed to an album-oriented rock format under contract to San Diego Radio Company. However, in 1984, the station stumbled in an ownership dispute. A bitter battle between San Diego Radio Company and Califórmula led to the abrupt end of the album rock format as the latter took control of the station. Díaz cited continued low ratings, but the straw that broke the camel's back was a humorous news report read on the station that stated a German anthropologist had discovered a tribe of \\"mole people\\" living in the sewers of Mexico City. When the report was read in late June, it caught the attention of Mexican authorities, who were outraged over the secondhand account they had heard, which implied that Mexicans were so poor they lived in sewers. In 1986, Díaz sold the American marketing rights for XHITZ again, this time to Broadcasting, Marketing and Management, Ltd. BMM ceased operation of the station on June 30, 1988 as it assigned the rights to another company, Consolidated Radio Sales, which was also bankrupt. The result was that Díaz and the head of Consolidated Radio Sales, Jack McCoy, clashed. In mid-July, McCoy fired all the employees in the US and had all the locks changed, with several employees instead showing up to work in Tijuana. Later that day, however, a bankruptcy judge ruled that Díaz owned the US operation of the stations. In 1989, XHITZ flipped from adult contemporary to a rock-oriented hits format known as \\"Pirate Radio,\\" based on the success of KQLZ in Los Angeles. On April 5, 1990, however, XHITZ switched formats to Rhythmic Top 40 under Program Director Rick Thomas, with a Dance-leaning direction. \\"Z90\\" competed against Q106, which was the powerhouse of Top 40 in the market. With Z90's debut, however, it took only a few books for XHITZ to beat Q106, and thanks to its success, it also forced the market's only Urban Contemporary outlet, future sister station XHRM-FM, out of that format by 1993. As Z90 remained on top, Q106 shifted towards a more Mainstream Top 40 format, and it wasn't until September 1996 that XHITZ would have another direct competitor against KHTS, which had a Dance lean, much like XHITZ. Even though XHITZ served as the official callsign, it was marketed unofficially as \\"XHTZ\\" also due to the fact most TV & radio callsigns carry four letters. However by August 1998, XHITZ would move away from its Dance approach to begin focusing more on R&B;/Hip-Hop. The station also rebranded as \\"Jammin' Z90\\" before reverting to \\"Z90.3\\". In 2002, Califórmula, which wound down most of its operations over the early 2000s as Díaz retired and then died. The US operating rights were sold to Clear Channel Communications (forerunner of today's iHeartMedia) and the concession was transferred to a new Mexican concern, Comunicación XERSA. XHITZ remained a hip-hop leader until 2004, when 98.9 XHMORE-FM flipped to a hip hop-leaning Rhythmic Top 40. These two stations would battle until late 2009, when XHMORE changed formats. Shortly after this, XHITZ shifted back to its Dance-leaning and more Mainstream sound. Despite being the market's only Rhythmic Top 40, XHITZ continued to share much of the same music as KHTS-FM and KEGY, all of whom are Rhythmic-leaning Top 40/CHRs, along with Adult Top 40 KMYI. On April 2, 2012, XHITZ rebranded itself from \\"Z90.3\\" to \\"Jammin' Z90.\\" In mid-2014, XHITZ rebranded back to \\"Z90.\\" Today, the station airs a CHR format, resulting in both Nielsen BDS and Mediabase moving XHITZ from the Rhythmic to Mainstream reporting panels in February 2015. Ownership/management Clear Channel controlled XHITZ and two other radio stations licensed to Mexico but programmed in English and aimed at the San Diego market, as well as owning five FM stations in San Diego as well. A 2003 Federal Communications Commission ruling forced Clear Channel to divest the operating rights to its Mexican stations in order to remain under FCC ownership caps. On July 25, 2005, Clear Channel transferred the programming and local marketing arrangements of XHITZ, along with XETRA-FM and XHRM-FM, to Finest City Broadcasting, a new company under the direction of former Clear Channel/San Diego VP/Market Manager Mike Glickenhaus. Finest City took over operations on December 1, 2005. In 2009, these programming and marketing rights were sold to Broadcast Corporation of the Americas after Finest City defaulted on assets that resulted in its bankruptcy. In 2010, BCA would spin off XHITZ, XETRA and XHRM to Local Media of America after a change in management. On October 6, 2015, Midwest Television (owners of 760 KFMB and 100.7 KFMB-FM) announced that it had entered into a joint operating agreement with Local Media San Diego LLC, forming an entity known as SDLocal to manage their collective cluster of stations. The intent of this agreement was to \\"[preserve the] local ownership and operation of San Diego's top-rated radio stations\\". The agreement ended at the end of 2016. Local Media San Diego eventually acquired KFMB and KFMB-FM outright from Tegna, Inc. on March 17, 2020, with KFMB (AM) being concurrently divested to iHeartMedia; Tegna had purchased Midwest Television's stations in 2018.

The team held the WWF Tag Team Championship on one occasion. Career =Formation and feud with Legion of Doom (1991-1992)= The precursor for the formation of happened on a June 1991 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling when Jimmy Hart announced he had signed André the Giant to form a tag team with Earthquake. When asked by interviewer Gene Okerlund to confirm, André denied the claims, leaving Hart angry and humiliated. Earthquake responded by attacking André from behind with Hart's megaphone and injuring André's knee. Jimmy Hart got revenge for the humiliation a few weeks later during a six-man tag team match featuring Earthquake and The Nasty Boys against the massive Tugboat and The Bushwhackers. It was revealed in this match that Hart secretly signed Tugboat, who turned on his partners after a few minutes of action and joined the Earthquake in laying the two New Zealanders out cold with a big splash. After the heel turn Tugboat changed his name to Typhoon and together they became known as “The Natural Disasters”. The Natural Disasters faced the Bushwhackers, with André in their corner, at the 1991 SummerSlam pay-per-view, whom they made very short work of. After destroying the Bushwhackers, the Disasters targeted André, but the assault was stopped by the Legion of Doom who ran off the Natural Disasters and kicked off the Legion of Doom / Natural Disasters feud. Later in the night the Legion of Doom would go on to win the WWF World Tag Team titles from the Nasty Boys, which meant that the Natural Disasters became first in line to get a shot at the new champions. The first big profile meeting between the two teams came at the 1991 Survivor Series where they were on opposing sides in an elimination match. Typhoon was eliminated due to a miscommunication with team member Irwin R. Schyster followed by Earthquake walking out with him, leaving the Legion of Doom as the eventual winners. From November to January the Disasters challenged for the tag team titles on the house show circuit but usually without a decisive outcome. At the 1992 Royal Rumble the Disasters got their biggest opportunity so far as they received a shot at the titles. The Disasters won the match via count out but not the titles. =Face turn and feud with Money Inc. (1992)= In February, Natural Disasters' manager Jimmy Hart led Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase & Irwin R. Schyster) to the WWF tag team titles as they defeated the Legion of Doom after which the L.O.D. briefly left the WWF. The Natural Disasters were outraged that their manager would go behind their backs and get another team a shot at the title, the storyline explanation was that Jimmy Hart used the Disasters' guaranteed return match for Money Inc. When the Natural Disasters challenged Money Inc. they won the fan support as they fired manager Jimmy Hart. The Disasters would first get their hands on Money Inc. at WrestleMania VIII where once again the Natural Disasters would win the match but not the titles as the champions were counted out. The Disasters did not let the setback stop them as they challenged for the titles repeatedly until they won them on July 20, 1992. After losing the titles Money Inc. had to focus on the challenges by the Legion of Doom, which gave the Natural Disasters the opportunity to defend their newly won titles against new competition. That competition came in the form of The Beverly Brothers (managed by The Genius), whom they defeated at SummerSlam 1992, the Disasters' first PPV pinfall in a year. Afterwards, the Disasters faced challenges by both the Nasty Boys and Money Inc., both managed by Jimmy Hart. In a series of events that mirrored how the Natural Disasters turned face the Nasty Boys turned on Jimmy Hart when Hart favored Money Inc. when signing title matches. The Nasty Boys turned on Hart, while Money Inc. regained the tag team titles from the Natural Disasters in October 1992. With the Nasty Boys also in the hunt for the tag team gold the Natural Disasters were slowly phased out of the tag team division with their last PPV outing as a team came at the 1992 Survivor Series PPV where they were eliminated by Money Inc. =Split and aftermath (1993-1994, 2001)= In 1993, Earthquake and Typhoon began showing signs of dissention, most noticeably at the 1993 Royal Rumble. Typhoon was already in the ring when Earthquake entered as #23 and he immediately went after his tag team partner, focusing only on him until Typhoon was eliminated. The Disasters’ feud never came to fruition as Earthquake left the WWF very early in 1993. Typhoon briefly stayed with the WWF after Earthquake left but never made anything as a singles competitor. Then, in mid-1993 he signed with WCW and made his infamous debut as The Shockmaster. He would later find himself in the WWF for a brief stay as Typhoon but again did not rise above mid card. Earthquake traveled to Japan in 1993 but made a very brief return in 1994 to engage in a “Sumo Vs Sumo” feud with Yokozuna. For the few months Earthquake was in the WWF, no mention of the tag team was made. He then went to WCW, where he wrestled as Avalanche at first and later became The Shark and finally wrestled under his real name before leaving. Earthquake briefly returned to the WWF in 1998 as the masked mute Golga, as a member of The Oddities. In 2001, the WWF hosted a sort of reunion of the Natural Disasters as they were both involved in the Gimmick Battle Royal of WrestleMania X-Seven, but Fred Ottman wrestled as Tugboat instead of Typhoon. Commentator Bobby Heenan, however, did allude to their previous alliance. Also, it was Earthquake who wound up eliminating Tugboat. In December of that year, Earthquake also wrestled in a tryout dark match at a SmackDown taping, but made no further appearances. John Tenta (Earthquake) died from bladder cancer in 2006.

The chain consisted of two- or three-story interior- corridor buildings constructed based on the company's prototype designs. Properties were usually a long, two- or three-story building with a gabled or lobby and public area at one end. All properties featured indoor pools and consistent amenities, which was the chain's main selling point. Founded in 1989 by (now) Arlington Hospitality, Cendant Corporation purchased the franchise rights in the late 1990s. Arlington continued to build and develop AmeriHost Inns using the prototype it originally created for the chain during this time. However, Cendant granted a small number of AmeriHost franchises to existing properties that do not conform to the original prototype standards, during the start of the millennium.

It includes three Nintendo-published puzzle video games released for older systems — Yoshi's Cookie (1992), Panel de Pon (1995), and Dr. Mario 64 (2001) — featuring updated graphics and music, alongside four-person multiplayer. The player can download one of the games to their Game Boy Advance via the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable. Development was done by subsidiary Nintendo Software Technology, assisted by Intelligent Systems. Originally titled Masterpiece Puzzle Collection in early versions, the game was made to appeal towards women with the inclusion of Panel de Pon, leading to Nintendo using Japanese actress Asami Abe to promote the game through television commercials. A playable demo was presented at E3 2003 and slated for a release in North America and Europe, but was never released for unknown reasons. Import reviews of Nintendo Puzzle Collection were favorable, being praised for its multiplayer and presentation, with several labeling Yoshi's Cookie and Panel de Pon as the best titles. Gameplay Nintendo Puzzle Collection is a compilation of three Nintendo-published puzzle games that were originally released on earlier Nintendo consoles. All the games support both single-player gameplay and competitive local multiplayer for up to four players simultaneously. In addition, Nintendo Puzzle Collection supports GameCube-Game Boy Advance connectivity, allowing the player to use a Game Boy Advance as a game controller. Downgraded versions of each game can also be downloaded and played independently on the Game Boy Advance. Each game is stored in the Game Boy Advance memory and will remain until the handheld is shut down. =Dr. Mario= is a port of Dr. Mario 64, originally released in 2001 for the Nintendo 64, which was not previously released in Japan. Like all Dr. Mario games, the gameplay focuses on eliminating colored viruses from the playing field by matching them with colored capsules. Dr. Mario was directed by Hitoshi Yamagami and Yoshiyuki Kato and the music was composed by Manabu Fujiki and Seiichi Tokunaga. The downloadable Game Boy Advance version is an emulation of the Nintendo Entertainment System version of Dr. Mario. =Yoshi's Cookie= was originally released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Famicom, and Game Boy consoles in 1992. Yoshi's Cookie was directed by Yasuhiro Minamimoto and Azusa Tajima, and the music (based on the original Yoshi's Cookie soundtrack) was arranged by Ai Yamashita. The downloadable Game Boy Advance version is an emulation of the NES version of Yoshi's Cookie. =Panel de Pon= is an update to the 1995 Super Famicom game Panel de Pon: Puzzle Action Game, which was rebranded as Tetris Attack outside Japan. It contains more features, but presents itself as a sequel following the descendants of the original cast of characters. It is based on a Nintendo 64 version that went unreleased in Japan, but was modified and released internationally as Pokémon Puzzle League. Panel de Pon was directed by Hitoshi Yamagami and Yukimi Shimura and the music (based on the original soundtrack) was arranged by Masaru Tajima. Development and release Nintendo Puzzle Collection was released for the GameCube in Japan on February 7, 2003. Development of the game was by Nintendo Software Technology and assisted by Intelligent Systems, who prior to which had designed the original Panel de Pon for the Super Famicom. Announced in December 2002 under the title Masterpiece Puzzle Collection, the game was made to appeal to women with the inclusion of Panel de Pon, with Nintendo using Japanese singer Asami Abe to help promote the game in television commercials — she had practiced the Famicom version of Dr. Mario before shooting. The collection itself was made to re-release the included titles due to most not being available to consumers anymore at the time, and to take advantage of the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable peripheral. In January 2003, a tournament for the game was held at the 17th Next Generation World Hobby Fair in Osaka, where contestants had to get the highest score possible in all three games under a set time limit. A playable demo, under the finalized name Nintendo Puzzle Collection, was presented at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) event, slated for a future release in both North America and Europe — for unknown reasons, the game was never released in those regions and remained exclusive to Japan. Reception Due to the game's Japan-exclusive release, reception of Nintendo Puzzle Collection is limited. The game holds an aggregate score of 75% on GameRankings based on two reviews. Michael Cole of Nintendo World Report, reviewing an imported copy, scored Nintendo Puzzle Collection 8 out of 10. Cole felt that Dr. Mario was the weakest selection of the three games available, with \\"uninspired\\" graphics and \\"unforgiving and honestly quite frustrating\\" gameplay. He remarked that while Panel de Pon was the best selection in regards to gameplay, Yoshi's Cookie had the most beautiful graphics.

The phrase going up refers to the case when a chain can be extended by \\"upward inclusion\\", while going down refers to the case when a chain can be extended by \\"downward inclusion\\". The major results are the Cohen–Seidenberg theorems, which were proved by Irvin S. Cohen and Abraham Seidenberg. These are known as the going-up and going-down theorems.  Going up and going down  Let A ⊆ B be an extension of commutative rings. The going-up and going-down theorems give sufficient conditions for a chain of prime ideals in B, each member of which lies over members of a longer chain of prime ideals in A, to be able to be extended to the length of the chain of prime ideals in A. =Lying over and incomparability= First, we fix some terminology. If \\\\mathfrak{p} and \\\\mathfrak{q} are prime ideals of A and B, respectively, such that :\\\\mathfrak{q} \\\\cap A = \\\\mathfrak{p} (note that \\\\mathfrak{q} \\\\cap A is automatically a prime ideal of A) then we say that \\\\mathfrak{p} lies under \\\\mathfrak{q} and that \\\\mathfrak{q} lies over \\\\mathfrak{p}. In general, a ring extension A ⊆ B of commutative rings is said to satisfy the lying over property if every prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} of A lies under some prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{q} of B. The extension A ⊆ B is said to satisfy the incomparability property if whenever \\\\mathfrak{q} and \\\\mathfrak{q}' are distinct primes of B lying over a prime \\\\mathfrak{p} in A, then \\\\mathfrak{q} ⊈ \\\\mathfrak{q}' and \\\\mathfrak{q}' ⊈ \\\\mathfrak{q}. = Going- up = The ring extension A ⊆ B is said to satisfy the going-up property if whenever :\\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\\\subseteq \\\\cdots \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{p}_n is a chain of prime ideals of A and :\\\\mathfrak{q}_1 \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{q}_2 \\\\subseteq \\\\cdots \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{q}_m (m < n) is a chain of prime ideals of B such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, \\\\mathfrak{q}_i lies over \\\\mathfrak{p}_i, then the latter chain can be extended to a chain :\\\\mathfrak{q}_1 \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{q}_2 \\\\subseteq \\\\cdots \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{q}_n such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, \\\\mathfrak{q}_i lies over \\\\mathfrak{p}_i. In it is shown that if an extension A ⊆ B satisfies the going- up property, then it also satisfies the lying-over property. = Going-down = The ring extension A ⊆ B is said to satisfy the going-down property if whenever :\\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\supseteq \\\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\\\supseteq \\\\cdots \\\\supseteq \\\\mathfrak{p}_n is a chain of prime ideals of A and :\\\\mathfrak{q}_1 \\\\supseteq \\\\mathfrak{q}_2 \\\\supseteq \\\\cdots \\\\supseteq \\\\mathfrak{q}_m (m < n) is a chain of prime ideals of B such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, \\\\mathfrak{q}_i lies over \\\\mathfrak{p}_i, then the latter chain can be extended to a chain :\\\\mathfrak{q}_1 \\\\supseteq \\\\mathfrak{q}_2 \\\\supseteq \\\\cdots \\\\supseteq \\\\mathfrak{q}_n such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, \\\\mathfrak{q}_i lies over \\\\mathfrak{p}_i. There is a generalization of the ring extension case with ring morphisms. Let f : A → B be a (unital) ring homomorphism so that B is a ring extension of f(A). Then f is said to satisfy the going-up property if the going-up property holds for f(A) in B. Similarly, if B is a ring extension of f(A), then f is said to satisfy the going-down property if the going-down property holds for f(A) in B. In the case of ordinary ring extensions such as A ⊆ B, the inclusion map is the pertinent map. Going-up and going-down theorems The usual statements of going-up and going-down theorems refer to a ring extension A ⊆ B: #(Going up) If B is an integral extension of A, then the extension satisfies the going-up property (and hence the lying over property), and the incomparability property. #(Going down) If B is an integral extension of A, and B is a domain, and A is integrally closed in its field of fractions, then the extension (in addition to going-up, lying-over and incomparability) satisfies the going-down property. There is another sufficient condition for the going-down property: * If A⊆B is a flat extension of commutative rings, then the going-down property holds.This follows from a much more general lemma in Bruns-Herzog, Lemma A.9 on page 415. Proof:Matsumura, page 33, (5.D), Theorem 4 Let p1 ⊆ p2 be prime ideals of A and let q2 be a prime ideal of B such that q2 ∩ A = p2. We wish to prove that there is a prime ideal q1 of B contained in q2 such that q1 ∩ A = p1. Since A ⊆ B is a flat extension of rings, it follows that Ap2 ⊆ Bq2 is a flat extension of rings. In fact, Ap2 ⊆ Bq2 is a faithfully flat extension of rings since the inclusion map Ap2 → Bq2 is a local homomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on spectra Spec(Bq2) → Spec(Ap2) is surjective and there exists a prime ideal of Bq2 that contracts to the prime ideal p1Ap2 of Ap2. The contraction of this prime ideal of Bq2 to B is a prime ideal q1 of B contained in q2 that contracts to p1. The proof is complete. Q.E.D. References * Atiyah, M. F., and I. G.

She took part in the Bengali nationalist movement of the 1950s and civil society leader in independent Bangladesh. She died in 1999 and was the first woman to be given a state funeral in Bangladesh. Early life Kamal with her husband Kamaludddin Ahmed (1939) Kamal was born in Shaestabad, Barisal. During her childhood, women's education was prohibited and she could not afford to get academic education. Nevertheless, she learned Bengali, Hindi, Urdu and Arabic languages at home education. In 1918, she went to Kolkata with her mother where she came to meet with Begum Rokeya.Prothom Alo, 20 November 2006 She was first married at the age of 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain who was a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahar. Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Sufia married Kamaluddin Ahmed. Kamal later had two other daughters, Sultana Kamal and Saida Kamal, and two sons Shahed Kamal and Sajed Kamal. In 1925, Kamal met Mahatma Gandhi, which inspired her to wear simple clothing. Kamal's first poem, Bashanti (Of Spring), was published in Saogat magazine in 1926. In 1931 she became the first Bengali Muslim female to be a member of the Indian Women Federation. Literature A short story Shainik Bodhu which Kamal wrote was published in a local paper in 1923. In 1937, she published her first collection of short stories, Keyar Kanta (Thorns of the Keya Tree). Her literary career took off after her first poetry publication. Her first book of poems, Sanjher Maya (Evening Enchantment), came out in 1938, bearing a foreword from Kazi Nazrul Islam and attracting praise from Rabindranath Tagore. Activism In 1947, Kamal became the inaugural editor of the Begum weekly magazine specialized on women's issues which was published by Mohammad Nasiruddin. In October of that year after the partition of India she came to Dhaka. During a huge clash between Hindu and Muslim of that time Kamal worked for their friendship and joined in Peace Committee. In 1948, when Purbo Pakistan Mohila Committee formed, she became its chairman. Kamal's activism continued in 1952, with the Language Movement. In 1961, when the Pakistani government banned Rabindra Sangeet (Songs of Rabindranath), she became involved in the movement among Bengalis that ensued in 1961. During the mass uprising in 1969, which demanded the resignation of Pakistani military general Ayub Khan, she promoted the cause by forming Mohila Sangram Parishad (Women's Struggle Group). In later life, she made women's rights her top priority and headed Bangladesh's largest women's organisation, Mahila Parishad, for many years. She did not see the oppression of women as mainly a class issue. She was also the first Chairperson of BRAC (1972–1980). Kamal was instrumental in getting the first women's dormitory of Dhaka University to be named Rokeya Hall, after Begum Rokeya. Role in liberation war Kamal showed her bravery several times. Once Ayub Khan at a meeting with social elites of Dhaka, commented that ordinary people are like beasts and as such, not fit to be given franchise. Sufia Kamal at once stood up and remarked, \\"If the people are beasts then as the President of the Republic, you are the king of the beasts.\\" When the news of the 'killings' of Kamal and Dr Nilima Ibrahim by Pak Army after the crack down on 25 March 1971 was broadcast on Akashbani, a radio station of the Indian state West Bengal, it drew criticism internationally and countries across the world put diplomatic pressure on the then Pakistani military government for clarification. The Pakistani government was forced to broadcast an interview with the poet on radio only to prove that Sufia Kamal was still alive. Zillur Rahman, the then regional director of Radio East Pakistan, forwarded a paper to Kamal to sign with the statement \\"In 1971 no massacre took place in Bangladesh.\\" When she refused, Rahman threatened, \\"If you don't give your signature then it might create a problem both for you and your son-in-law Kahar Chowdhury.\\" She told him that she didn't care for her life. She said, \\"I would rather die than put my signature on the false statement.\\" She actively but secretly helped freedom fighters of the Liberation War. In 1971, several people in Dhaka including professor Ghyasuddin Ahmed and writer Shahidullah Kaiser collected medicine and food and delivered those to the posts of Sufia Kamal's house, from where the freedom fighters picked those up for their training outpost. From July 1971, she used to go to the hospital with food and medicine for the injured people of war. At that time there was an acute crisis of food and medicine in the hospital. She used to give food and medicine to certain rickshaw pullers at the Science Laboratory, Dhaka. They would take the food and medicine to the freedom fighters. She was able to establish closer contact with the freedom fighters such as Abul Barak Alvi, Shafi Imam Rumi, Masud Sadek Chullu and Jewel in August. As the Pakistani army kept their strong watch on her, she would try to help the freedom fighters in different ways ignoring the risks. Except Abul Barak Alvi, all others died in the hand of the Pakistani Army. The Pakistan Army and their collaborators killed Sufia Kamal's son-in-law, Kahar Chowdhury, because they were very angry with her. Early December 1971 Shahidullah Kaiser, Munier Chowdhury and Fazle Rabbi cautioned her to leave Dhaka but they themselves did not leave and got caught and later got killed.

Merger of 'Youth' with PC logo The Progressive Conservative Youth Federation (PCYF) was the constitutionally enshrined youth body of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. When the PC Party and the Canadian Alliance merged in 2004, a formalized youth group was rejected by delegates at the founding convention of the Conservative Party in Montréal by a vote of 51% to 49%. As a result of that vote, PCYF ceased to exist. History Circa 1956. Logo of the Young PC Association PCYF had operated in various capacities for more than 60 years. Its genesis arose from two unique sources – campus politics and riding politics. In a time when few Canadians went to University, a young Progressive Conservative was any person under the age of 35. The president of the early Young Conservatives was often a successful person in their 30s - a Member of Parliament or senior political staffer. Conservative campus politics can be traced back to the University of Toronto campus club in 1926. However, the national Progressive Conservative Student Federation was not created until 1946. Campus politics gained importance in the 1950s and played a key role in the rise to power of John Diefenbaker and his eventual overthrow (through a Leadership review). Former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark got his political start as a \\"Youth for Diefenbaker\\". Today, campus clubs are a way of organizing and involving students in the party, but in the 1950s, campus politics were a venue for the political parties to control student politics. In the 1960s, the two national youth organizations that had served the party for decades merged into one group. The federation of campus clubs (Progressive Conservative Student Federation) and the non-University, riding-based youth group (Young Progressive Conservative Association) merged to create the Progressive Conservative Youth Federation. PCYF was then sanctioned as the PC Party’s official youth wing. As in many political parties, youth members could vote at national conventions that pick leaders and establish policy. In the Progressive Conservative Party, they accounted for 1/3 of all elected delegates, giving youth a significant influence on the direction the party took. This incorporated a democratic counterweight to established party hierarchy, manifesting itself dramatically in grassroots conventions that elected (and eventually removed) John Diefenbaker, Brian Mulroney, and Kim Campbell. Many prominent Tories got their start in the youth wing, including: Brian Mulroney, Joe Clark and Jean Charest. Structure The PCYF was headed by a national executive, which was elected at a General meeting held every 2–3 years. The executive consisted of: * President * VP Anglophone * VP Francophone * Finance Director * Policy Director * Campus Director * Organization Director/Membership Director * Communications Director * Recruitment Director In the early years of the organization, a youth member was described as someone under the age of 35. As a result of amendments to the PC Party constitution at the Winnipeg convention in 1996, the age range was reduced so as to only include members between the ages of 14 and 25. Finances The organization was primarily funded through an annual grant from the PC Party of Canada. However, the grant was not a preset amount and varied wildly based on the current fortunes of the national party. PCYF was allowed to raise its own funds, but these efforts were often crippled by a lack of experience from those involved, competing efforts from the central party, or competition from youth raising funds for the next general meeting. Controversy The PCYF was a leader in sentiment to merge the PC Party of Canada with the Reform Party of Canada and its successor, the Canadian Alliance. At the Winnipeg convention in 1996, PCYF President Tasha Kheiriddin circulated the 'Tory Top Ten', a list of policies which included a 10% personal income tax cut. The PCYF were successful in having this measure adopted by the party, thus making it the first federal political party to call for income tax cuts. In the 1998 PCYF elections, future MP Patrick Brown, who then was then only 19 years old, was elected PCYF president in a hotly contested race. Brown won the presidential election based on heavy support from Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. Also elected were Adam Daifallah and Jasmine Igneski. Both Daifallah and Igneski made a well-publicized defection to the Canadian Alliance during the 1999 PC Party National Meeting in Toronto. Daifallah would later become a well-known author and Jasmine Igneski a member of Prime Minister Harper's office. Patrick Brown caused considerable controversy as PCYF president in 1999 when he pushed for the merger of the right wing movement despite the objection of Tory leader Joe Clark. This move eventually led to PCYF aggressively pushing a united right during the tenure of Brown's presidency. Brown faced considerable opposition from some members of the senior party who were hostile to a united right. Brown campaigned on TV along with Adam Daifallah for the united right. These activities were consistent with a long history of PCYF activism that made lasting contributions to Canada's political democracy, including the removal of John Diefenbaker by Dalton Camp, the adoption of Leadership review as a process to enshrine accountability, the leadership selection of Brian Mulroney and Kim Campbell.

It is a form of speculative computing. Non-essential instructions include such things as results that are not written to memory, or compare operations that will always return true. Also as statistically most branch instructions will be taken it makes sense to assume this will always be the case. Because of the speculation involved slipstream processors are generally described as having two parallel executing streams. One is an optimized faster A-stream executing the reduced code, the other is the slower R-stream which runs behind the A-stream and executes the full code. The R-stream runs faster than if it were a single stream due to data being prefetched by the A-stream effectively hiding memory latency, and due to the A-stream's assistance with branch prediction. The two streams both complete faster than a single stream would. As of 2005, theoretical studies have shown that this configuration can lead to a speedup of around 20%. The main problem with this approach is accuracy: as the A-stream becomes more accurate and less speculative, the overall system runs slower. Furthermore, a large enough distance is needed between the A-stream and the R-stream so that cache misses generated by the A-stream do not slow down the R-stream.  References  * Z. Purser, K.

Bhagabat's youngest daughter Raimoni's motherly and affectionate feelings towards Ishwar touched him deeply and had a strong influence on his later revolutionary work towards the upliftment of women's status in India. His quest for knowledge was so intense that he used to study under a street light as it was not possible for him to afford a gas lamp at home He cleared all the examinations with excellence and in quick succession. He was rewarded with a number of scholarships for his academic performance. To support himself and the family, Ishwar Chandra also took a part-time job of teaching at Jorashanko. Ishwar Chandra joined the Sanskrit College, Calcutta and studied there for twelve long years and passed out of the college in 1841 qualifying in Sanskrit Grammar, Literature, Dialectics [Alankara Shastra], Vedanta, Smriti and Astronomy As was the custom then Ishwar Chandra married at the age of fourteen. His wife was Dinamayee Devi. Narayan Chandra Bandyopadhyaya was their only son. In the year 1839, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar successfully cleared his Sanskrit law examination. In 1841, at the age of twenty-one years, Ishwar Chandra joined Fort William College as head of the Sanskrit department. After five years, in 1846, Vidyasagar left Fort William College and joined the Sanskrit College as 'Assistant Secretary'. In the first year of service, Ishwar Chandra recommended a number of changes to the existing education system. This report resulted in a serious altercation between Ishwar Chandra and College Secretary Rasomoy Dutta. In 1849, he against the advice of Rasomoy Dutta, resigned from Sanskrit College and rejoined Fort William College as a head clerk. =Widow remarriage= Vidyasagar championed the upliftment of the status of women in India, particularly in his native Bengal. Unlike some other reformers who sought to set up alternative societies or systems, he sought to transform society from within. Unable to tolerate the ill-treatment, many of these girls would run away and turn to prostitution to support themselves. Ironically, the economic prosperity and lavish lifestyles of the city made it possible for many of them to have successful careers once they stepped out of the sanction of society and into the demi-monde. In 1853 it was estimated that Calcutta had a population of 12,700 prostitutes and public women. Many widows had to shave their heads and don white saris, supposedly to discourage attention from men. They led a deplorable life, something Vidyasagar thought was unfair and sought to change.Sarkar, Nikhil [Sripantho] (1977) Bat tala. Calcutta: Ananda. p. 66. (in Bengali) = Spread of Education beyond Higher Classes = The Wood’s despatch of 1854—considered the Magna Carta of Indian education—adopted a new policy towards 'mass education'. Hitherto the official focus was on the upper classes of population for education. Dubbed the 'Downward Filtration Theory', this implied that education always filters down from the upper classes of the society to the common masses. In 1859, the government’s education policy reiterated \\"the spread of vernacular elementary instruction among the lower orders\\". Upon this, Vidyasagar addressed a letter, dated 29 September 1859, to John Peter Grant, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, underlining his perception: > An impression appears to have gained ground, both here and in England, that > enough has been done for the education of the higher classes and that > attention should now be directed towards the education of the masses... An > enquiry into the matter will, however, show a very different state of > things. As the best, if not the only practicable means of promoting > education in Bengal, the Government should, in my humble opinion, confine > itself to the education of the higher classes on a comprehensive scale. The words \\"higher classes\\" in Bengali parlance do not entail anything but caste which bestows or withdraws the privilege of education on a person by birth. Thus, Vidyasagar explicitly advocated for confining education to \\"higher classes\\". Earlier in 1854, Vidyasagar had scoffed at the admission of a wealthy man from the goldsmith caste of Bengal in the Sanskrit College, Calcutta. His argument was that \\"in the scale of castes, the class (goldsmith or Subarnabanik) stands very low\\". Notably, Sanjib Chattopadhyay, a biographer of Vidyasagar, revealed that Ishwar Chandra started his primary education in a school established and maintained by Shibcharan Mallick, a rich man of goldsmith caste in Calcutta.Bartaman, Sharad Special Issue, Calcutta, 1411 B.S., p. 345. = Vidyasagar in Santal Pargana = Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar’s long association with Karmatar, a sleepy hamlet about 20 km from the district headquarters of Jamtara, seems to have been forgotten by the people of the state. Vidyasagar came to Karmatar in 1873 and spent more than 18 years of his life here. He had set up a girls’ school and a night school for adults on the premises of his house, which he called Nandan Kanan. He also opened a free homeopathy clinic to provide some medical care to these unprivileged tribal people. After his death the Nandan Kanan, the abode of Vidyasagar was sold by his son to Mallick family of Kolkata. Before Nandan Kanan could be dismantled Bengali Association Bihar on 29 March 1974 purchased it by money collected by house to house contribution of one rupee each. The Girls School has been restarted, named after Vidyasagar. The Free Homeopathic Clinic is serving local population. The house of Vidyasagar has been maintained in the original shape. The most prized property is the 141 year old ‘Palanquin’ used by Vidyasagar himself. The Government of Jharkhand on 26 September 2019 named Jamtara district's Karmatand block as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar Block as a mark of respect on the birth anniversary of the great social reformer. An official release quote of Jharkhand's former Chief Minister Raghubar Das: > \\"Jamtara's Karmatand prakhand (block) was the 'karma bhumi' (workplace) of > social reformer and strong supporter of women's education Ishwar Chandra > Vidyasagar. Now the block will be known as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar > prakhand\\" Meeting with Ramakrishna Vidyasagar was liberal in his outlook even though he was born in an orthodox Hindu Brahmin family. Also, he was highly educated and influenced by Oriental thoughts and ideas. Ramakrishna in contrast, did not have a formal education. Yet they had a nice relation between them. When Ramakrishna met Vidyasagar, he praised Vidyasagar as the ocean of wisdom. Vidyasagar joked that Ramkrishna should have collected some amount of salty water of that sea. But, Ramakrishna, with profound humbleness & respect, replied that the water of general sea might be salty, but not the water of the sea of wisdom. Accolades Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar on a 1970 stamp of India Vidyasagar Setu, which connects Howrah and Kolkata, is named after him Shortly after Vidyasagar's death, Rabindranath Tagore reverently wrote about him: \\"One wonders how God, in the process of producing forty million Bengalis, produced a man!\\" After death, he is remembered in many ways, some of them include: #Vidyasagar Setu (commonly known as the Second Hooghly Bridge), is a bridge over the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. It links the city of Howrah to its twin city of Kolkata. The bridge is named after Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. #In 2004, Vidyasagar was ranked number 9 in BBC's poll of the Greatest Bengali of all time. — #Vidyasagar College in Kolkata is named after him, as well as Vidyasagar University in Paschim Midnapore. #Rectitude and courage were the hallmarks of Vidyasagar's character, and he was certainly ahead of his time. In recognition of his scholarship and cultural work the government designated Vidyasagar a Companion of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1877Dutt, Romesh (1962) Cultural Heritage of Bengal. Kolkata, Punthi Pustak. p. 117. In the final years of life, he chose to spend his days among the \\"Santhals\\", an old tribe in India. # Indian Post issued stamps featuring Vidyasagar in 1970 and 1998.:File:Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar 1970 stamp of India.jpg, :File:Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar 1998 stamp of India.jpg References Further reading * Indramitra, Karunasagar Vidyasagar, Ananda Publishers, Kolkata * * External links * * Isvar Chandra Vidyasagar at the Encyclopædia Britannica * Category:1820 births Category:1891 deaths Category:Hindu scholars Category:Bengali writers Category:Bengali Hindus Category:Bengali people Category:Indian reformers Category:Writers from Kolkata Category:People from Paschim Medinipur district Category:Translators of Kālidāsa Category:Indian Sanskrit scholars Category:The Sanskrit College and University alumni Category:Widowhood in India Category:19th-century Indian educational theorists Category:Founders of Indian schools and colleges Category:19th-century Indian translators Category:19th-century Indian educators Category:19th-century Indian philosophers Category:Scholars from West Bengal Category:Sanskrit scholars from Bengal Category:Language reformers ","title":"Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar"},{"id":"2083487","text":"The Eliminators were a professional wrestling tag team that consisted of Perry Saturn and John Kronus who were best known for their time in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) between 1995 and 1997. History While working as the manager of a nightclub in Boston, Perry Satullo met bouncer George Caiazzo, who expressed an interest in becoming a wrestler. Satullo sent Caiazzo to Killer Kowalski's school to train, and then offered to form a tag team with him. Satullo took the name Saturn, after the Roman god of agriculture and the harvest, and Caiazzo took the name of Saturn's Greek equivalent Cronus, with the spelling slightly altered as \\"Kronus\\". Satullo proposed that the team be known as \\"The Harvesters of Sorrow\\" due to the significance of their ring names, but promoter Jerry Lawler advised Satullo that the significance would not be evident to many fans. The team then became known as \\"The Eliminators\\". =United States Wrestling Association= The Eliminators wrestled their first match together at a United States Wrestling Association house show in 1993. They were hired at a starting salary of $40 a week, and shared an apartment with Brendan Shanahan and James Lewis. After working with the USWA for a while, gaining experience as a team the two managed to negotiate a 100% pay rise. The team's first brush with tag-team gold came when they made it all the way to the finals of a tournament to crown new USWA Tag Team Champions but lost in the finals to Brian Christopher and Saturn's mentor \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert in April 1994. The team kept pursuing the titles and a few weeks later on May 2, 1994 Saturn and Kronus beat Christopher and Gilbert for the titles. The Eliminators held the gold for about 6 weeks until they came up against PG-13 on June 13, 1994 who beat them for the titles. The Eliminators stuck around the USWA for the remainder of 1994 working both as a tag-team and in individual competition. In 1995, Saturn and Kronus branched out and traveled to Japan to work for the Japanese promotion WAR. On one WAR card they tangled with wrestling legends Mil Máscaras, Bob Backlund and Jimmy Snuka. =Extreme Championship Wrestling= During their tour of Japan the compactly-built and heavily tattooed Saturn and the high-flying Kronus caught the attention of booker Paul Heyman. Heyman signed the two with Extreme Championship Wrestling when they were originally brought in to job to the Steiner Brothers when he thought they were staying with the company for a lengthy period, however they would later defeat The Steiner Brothers and Taz at Gangstas Paradise on September 16, 1995. Heyman initially planned on giving the Eliminators a sadomasochism gimmick and but soon changed his mind and presented the duo as an unstoppable force ala The Road Warriors. He also gave them a manager, Jason Knight, to compensate for their weak interview skills. The Eliminators started a violent feud with The Pitbulls whom they clashed with repeatedly between October 1995 and April 1996 losing to them at the supercard November To Remember 1995 although they would defeat them in rematches at December to Dismember and Holiday Hell 1995. During their feud, the teams clashed in both in regular tag-team competition such as during December To Dismember when teaming with Raven, Stevie Richards and The Heavenly Bodies in an Ultimate Jeopardy Steel Cage match against the Pitbulls, Public Enemy and Tommy Dreamer on December 9, 1995. After The Pitbulls' manager Francine cut Saturn's hair, he shaved his head completely in a homage to Mickey Knox, the character depicted by Woody Harrelson in Natural Born Killers (in reality, Saturn was beginning to go bald). On February 2, 1996 at Big Apple Blizzard Blast the Eliminators beat Cactus Jack and Mikey Whipwreck to win the ECW World Tag Team Championship. After disposing of the longtime rivals the Pitbulls at Big Ass Extreme Bash on March 8 (although the team defeated the Pitbulls in later house shows), the Eliminators were targeted by The Gangstas setting off a bloody feud between the two teams facing them in a 6-man tag team match with Brian Lee against The Gangstas and Tommy Dreamer at A Matter of Respect 1996 and later faced them in title defences at Fight The Power and Hardcore Heaven 1996, the latter a resulting in a no contest. On August 13, 1996 the Gangstas beat the Eliminators for the tag-team titles in a four corners elimination match with the Bruise Brothers and the Samoan Gangsta Party at the supercard The Doctor Is In and, although defeated in subsequent rematches, The Gangstas managed to hold on to the gold until the Eliminators regained the titles at a house show in Middletown, New York on December 20, 1996. As the Eliminators/Gangstas feud continued into 1997, another team entered the fray making it a three way between the Eliminators, the Gangstas and The Dudley Boyz. After defenses against teams such as Axl Rotten and D-Von Dudley and Sabu and Rob Van Dam, the Dudley Boys won the tag-team titles from the Eliminators at Hostile City Showdown 1997 on March 15, 1997 only to lose them back to the Eliminators at ECW's first PPV Barely Legal on April 13, 1997. On May 31, 1997 in Trenton, New Jersey, during a three-way dance with the Dudley Boyz and PG-13, Saturn tore his ACL when he landed on a crutch while executing a kick on Big Dick Dudley. Despite the injury, Saturn continued to compete and defeated the Dudley Boyz at Wrestlepalooza 1997 and Kronus continued defending the title in handicap matches against the F.B.I before Saturn competed in a match that saw the Eliminators drop the tag-team titles back to the Dudley Boyz at a house show in Waltham, Massachusetts on June 20, 1997. After intense reconstructive surgery, Saturn was given a recovery time of as much as a year. He began rehabilitating after two months and returned to action in August although in a diminished capacity due to his knee problems. Saturn had become impatient with what he regarded as Kronus' lack of motivation and dedication, and refused to reform the Eliminators. Paul Heyman offered to release him from his contract if he could find alternate employment. Saturn entered into negotiations with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and signed a contract with them while not being 100% recovered from his knee injury. After Saturn left, Kronus began teaming with various wrestlers, including former enemy New Jack to form The Gangstanators but never achieved the same success as he did together with Saturn.

School songs: The Magnolia Song and Summer Suns Mascot: The Mustang History In 1890 John and Abigail MacDuffie purchased Miss Howard’s School on Union Street, Springfield, Massachusetts. This property included the home of Samuel Bowles of the founding family of the Springfield Daily Republican which was transformed into a classroom building known as Main House. The school property once adjacent to a park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted was transformed and renamed The MacDuffie School, an all-girls college preparatory school.Goodhue, Douglas J.

It was located on a 15-acre campus in the middle of Springfield's Maple Hill neighborhood of tree-lined streets, and with landscaped grounds of late 19th- and early 20th century mansions that were once homes to Springfield's leading industrialists and businessmen.Marilyn Sutin, Editor (January 5, 2012). \\"Springfield Preservation Trust Newsletter: Preservation Massachusetts Most Endangered List\\" (PDF).

Fashioned after their alma maters, MacDuffie provided young women the same access to excellence in education the MacDuffies experienced at Harvard and Radcliffe. A suffragist and believer in civil rights, Abby MacDuffie instilled a sense of curiosity about the world, equality for all, and progressive thinking in her students that remains at the school’s core today. In 1936 their son Malcolm and his wife Margaret took over as Heads, but he chose to pursue a different career and they sold the school in 1941 at the beginning of World War II, to Ralph and Cleminette Rutenber. The Rutenbers (1941–1972) extended both the reputation of the school and the campus itself, acquiring the athletic field and several large homes on the south side of Central Street and Ames Hill Drive and constructing Rutenber Hall (the school’s main classroom/library facility) and Downing Gymnasium in 1963. Under the Rutenber’s leadership, the school enjoyed its largest enrollments in the 1960s and 70s, reaching 360 boarding and day students from all over the U.S. and abroad.\\"History of MacDuffie\\". Retrieved 19 October 2015. The legacy of the MacDuffie and the Rutenber years of leadership, however, lies chiefly in the intellectual ideals they instilled through their vision and care. In 1990, the year of the MacDuffie Centennial, the school became coeducational and the traditional girls' boarding program became the Ames Hill family-style program, primarily for international students, who resided with house parents in the historic homes on Ames Hill. Under the tenure of Head Michael L. Cornog (1988–1999), the school also added a sixth grade to create a fully integrated middle school curriculum. In December 2010 the school's board of trustees announced that the NY-based International EC LLC acquired the school's name, mission, and intellectual property. EC International moved the school from Springfield to the former St. Hyacinth Seminary campus in Granby MA, which was purchased to continue the school’s mission. Faculty, staff, and students moved to the new Granby MacDuffie campus in 2011. On June 1, 2011, five days before graduation in the school's final year in Springfield, the school's campus on Ames Hill Drive was devastated by a rare EF3 tornado that tore through several neighborhoods in the city and surrounding towns. Many student, faculty and staff were present on the campus at the time of the tornado and while there were no injuries, the campus was severely damaged with most of its trees uprooted as well as damage to buildings. In the fall of 2011, MacDuffie School relocated and opened in Granby where it continues to operate. Stephen Griffin was appointed as the Head of School and continues to serve as such. The MacDuffie School now offers students a much larger campus with enhanced classroom space, boarding facilities, greater technology and athletic fields. In July 2015, MMI Holdings, a Delaware education management company, purchased EC International. Sources * \\"Academics\\". The MacDuffie School. The MacDuffie School. 2014.

The group originally started as a three-man group with D'Lo Brown in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), before evolving into a four-man group with Killer Kyle. Professional wrestling career =North Georgia Wrestling Alliance (1994)= The Gangstas was formed by New Jack and Mustafa Saed in North Georgia Wrestling Alliance in 1994. They would win their Tag Team Championship, but quickly vacated them upon leaving the promotion that July. =Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994-1995)= Upon arriving in Smoky Mountain Wrestling in July 1994 alongside D-Lo Brown, they would cut promos about activist Medgar Evers and O.J. Simpson to infuriate the southern white crowd. They would use fried chicken and watermelons as props and win matches as a result of a two count (rather than the conventional three count), purportedly due to Affirmative Action. Ring announcers would, on more than one occasion, confuse their hometown as being Louisiana (LA) instead of Los Angeles (L.A.) which would entice New Jack to verbally abuse the announcer. Killer Kyle would join the Gangstas in March 1995 during their feud with Jim Cornette and Bob Armstrong. They would primarily feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express, The Thugs, and PG-13. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995-1997)= New Jack and Mustafa left SMW in June 1995, in a controversial fashion, which escalated the long-standing dispute between Paul Heyman and Jim Cornette.

It was a spin-off from the Legacy of Kain series of action-adventure games, and took place in its eponymous fictional universe. Nosgoth employed a player versus player system in which each match consisted of two rounds. Teams were composed of characters assigned to one of two races: vampires, designed around hack and slash combat; and humans, whose gameplay was styled after third- person shooters. Between rounds, teams would switch to control the opposing race, and the team which accumulated the most points by fighting their counterparts won the match. Initially announced in June 2013 following internet leaks, Nosgoth was the first Legacy of Kain-associated game to debut in almost ten years, preceded by 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Though once intended for release as part of a single-player project, Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun, it was reconceptualized and continued development as a standalone title following Dead Sun's cancellation. When officially revealed in September 2013, Nosgoth attracted negative reception for its conceptual departure from the traditional single-player and story-driven Legacy of Kain formula. The game's open beta began in January 2015 and ended in May 2016. On April 8, 2016, Square Enix Europe announced that Nosgoth's servers would shut down on May 31, 2016. Nosgoth's official forums also shut down on June 14, 2016. Gameplay Nosgoth was an asymmetrical online multiplayer third-person shooter. Nosgoth's gameplay focuses on melee Vampire characters against the ranged Human characters. Gameplay consists of two modes: Deathmatch in which The Vampires and Humans fight against each other to get a higher kill-count than the opposing team. If the killcount reaches a threshold, the team that reached it wins. Or time runs out, the team with the higher kills wins, and Flashpoint: offshoot of traditional Domination modes that tasks Humans with capturing a series of control points in the map. Two points are initially available, chosen at random, and when one point is captured, another appears. Humans have a limited amount of time to complete their mission, but each successful capture adds time to the clock, extending the match. Vampires win if they can prevent captures long enough for the match timer to run out. Both team types use a character class-based system, meaning there are different vampires and humans that have varying different roles. The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, as Vampires rely on surprise attacks. Both teams possess abilities, which can be activated having cooldown periods when used, or are passive/innately active. Vampires have the ability to fly and climb buildings, humans are grounded and do not get to experience this trait. The Humans rely on weaponry, and projectile-based ranged attacks, such as crossbows. They have ammunition that can be depleted, which can then be refilled at ammunition stations. Vampires being melee, will have very different ways to attack, such as pouncing on top of a human and clawing at them, making them unable to act as they are knocked down, or being grabbed by a flying-based Vampire and dropped into more Vampires. Plot After the execution of Raziel in Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Kain used the Chronoplast - a time-streaming device - to advance to his return, seemingly abandoning his empire. With the resulting power vacuum, the vampire clans of the empire fell against each other in a bloody civil war that nearly wiped out Raziel's clan. With the vampires occupied by their own internal struggles, humanity slowly became resurgent as escapees and free humans united to rebuild their shattered civilization. Reconstructing cities and defences, and building themselves into a legitimate fighting force, the humans came to occupy a swath of southern Nosgoth. Attacks on key territories under vampire control eventually alerted the vampires to the danger posed by their former slaves and prompted the co-operation of the vampire clans in the face of the new threat - and a new war began for control of land of Nosgoth. Development After the release of Legacy of Kain: Defiance in 2003, it emerged that a sixth Legacy of Kain game had entered development at Ritual Entertainment in 2004, but was canceled before being publicly revealed. In 2013, speculation concerning the existence of another new Legacy of Kain project began with the discovery that series publisher Square Enix had registered the domain name warfornosgoth.com, thereby making reference to Nosgoth, the fictional setting of the series. The Official Xbox Magazine subsequently revealed evidence that Passion Pictures artist Richard Buxton had worked on a Legacy of Kain \\"animation pitch\\" in 2011; Buxton responded with the comment, \\"I'm not allowed to talk about that\\". In May 2013, an Advanced Micro Devices patch log and a profile on the Steam database were found to contain further references to an upcoming title named \\"War for Nosgoth\\" or \\"Nosgoth\\". Additionally, the LinkedIn profile of video game composer Kevin Riepl referred to a project named \\"Nosgoth\\", citing Square Enix as its publisher and Psyonix Games as its developer. In early June 2013, Square Enix London Studios community manager George Kelion responded to the leaks and ensuing fan speculation by confirming the existence and ongoing development of the Nosgoth project to VG247 and Eurogamer, saying \\"it feels weird to have a bunch of info out there and we don't want the community to get the wrong idea\\". He clarified that Nosgoth was set in the same universe as previous Legacy of Kain titles, but that it was \\"not a traditional or even single-player LoK experience\\". and that \\"it's very much on a separate branch to both the Soul Reaver and Blood Omen series\\". Kelion further stated that long-time Legacy of Kain developers Crystal Dynamics were not involved in the project, and that Nosgoth would be officially announced, and properly revealed, at a later date, beyond the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013. In late June 2013, Legacy of Kain fan Mama Robotnik posted evidence from sources at Climax Studios, that Nosgoth had originated as a primarily single-player, story-based game, named Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun. The project had allegedly been under development between 2009 and 2012 by Climax Studios with supervision from Crystal Dynamics, and was intended as a PlayStation 4 launch title. Its multiplayer mode, developed by Psyonix Games, reportedly became Nosgoth after the single-player component of the game was canceled by Square Enix in 2012, who projected that it would fail to meet sales expectations. Kelion responded by confirming that Dead Sun existed and that Nosgoth was intended to be its multiplayer companion game, but said Nosgoth is a separate project which has \\"grown in size and scope since its initial conception\\", featuring \\"different mechanics, characters, levels and gameplay\\". He rejected the idea that it is \\"the multiplayer component of Dead Sun pulled out and fleshed out\\". According to Kelion, Nosgoth is not a reboot, a mobile game, an open world game, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), or a real-time strategy game, nor is it \\"best described as a MOBA game\\" (multiplayer online battle arena). It derives influences from the second game in the series, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and is played from a third-person viewpoint. It was set to be available on Microsoft Windows as a download-only title. In March 2016, Square Enix and Psyonix announced that the game would leave early access very soon. However, on April 8, 2016, Square Enix announced that they had cancelled the game as it had failed to captivate a broad audience. Reception GameSpot Cameron Woolsey rated the game 6/10, praising its entertaining gameplay and detailed environments, but citing a lack of content, balance concerns, technical problems and discontinuity with the Legacy of Kain series as faults.

There is reason to doubt that Napoleon ever used it. No contemporaneous French newspaper mentions that he did. The phrase was first used in an offensive sense by the French revolutionary Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac on 11 June 1794 in a speech to the National Convention: “Let Pitt then boast of his victory to his nation of shopkeepers”.A.M. Adams, ‘’A View of Universal History’’ (London, 1795), vol III, 312. Later, during the Napoleonic wars, the British press mentioned the phrase, attributing it either to “the French” or to Napoleon himself.Notes and Queries, September 1865, page 191 , accessed 10 June 2015. A later, explicit source is Barry Edward O'Meara, who was surgeon to Napoleon during his exile in St. Helena.Barry Edward O'Meara, Napoleon in Exile, (London, 1822) vol 2, page 52. If O'Meara is to be believed, Napoleon said: There may be grounds to doubt the veracity of this account.1\\\\. While some contemporaries regarded O’Meara as a reliable source (e.g. ‘’The Edinburgh Review’’, vol 37, 1822, p.165), others thought he was duplicitous (e.g. Colburn’s ‘’United Service Magazine’’, 1843, Part III, 371: “he could not look an honest man directly in the face”). He was dismissed from the Royal Navy for duplicity (). 2. The political sentiments attributed to Napoleon are typical of an 1820s British Radical [which O’Meara was], but not of an Emperor of the French. 3. If Napoleon had really meant at the time to describe the English as a rich nation of merchants it is rather difficult to see why he would have used the expression “shopkeepers”, denoting petty retailers. 4. The lack of an attested contemporaneous French source. The supposed French original as uttered by Napoleon (une nation de boutiquiers) is frequently cited, but it has no attestation. O'Meara conversed with Napoleon in Italian, not French. There is no other source. After the war English newspapers sometimes tried to correct the impression. For example the following article appeared in the Morning Post of 28 May 1832:Page 3 > ENGLAND A NATION OF SHOPKEEPERS This complimentary term, for so we must > consider it, as applied to a Nation which has derived its principal > prosperity from its commercial greatness, has been erroneously attributed, > from time to time, to all the leading Revolutionists of France. To our > astonishment we now find it applied exclusively to BONAPARTE. Than this > nothing can be further from the fact. NAPOLEON was scarcely known at the > time, he being merely an Officer of inferior rank, totally unconnected with > politics. The occasion on which that splenetic, but at the same time, > complimentary observation was made was that of the ever-memorable battle of > the 1st of June. The oration delivered on that occasion was by M. BARRERE > [sic], in which, after describing our beautiful country as one \\"on which the > sun scarce designs to shed its light\\", he described England as a nation of > shopkeepers. In any case the phrase did not originate with Napoleon, or even Barère. It first appears in a non-pejorative sense in The Wealth of Nations (1776) by Adam Smith, who wrote: Smith is also quoted as saying that Britain was \\"a nation that is governed by shopkeepers\\", which is how he put it in the first (1776) edition. It is unlikely that either Adam Smith or Napoleon used the phrase to describe that class of small retailers who would not even have had the franchise. The phrase may have been part of standard 18th-century economic dialogue. It has been suggested that Napoleon may have heard it during a meeting of the French Convention on 11 June 1794, when Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac quoted Smith's phrase. But this presupposes that Napoleon himself, as opposed to Barère alone, used the phrase. The phrase has also been attributed to Samuel Adams, but this is disputed; Josiah Tucker, Dean of Gloucester, produced a slightly different phrase in 1766: Napoleon would have been correct in seeing the United Kingdom as essentially a commercial and naval rather than a land based power, but during his lifetime it was fast being transformed from a mercantile to an industrial nation, a process which laid the basis for a century of British hegemony after the Battle of Waterloo. Although the UK had half the population of France during the Napoleonic Wars, there was a higher per capita income and, consequently, a greater tax base, necessary to conduct a prolonged war of attrition. The United Kingdom's economy and its ability to finance the war against Napoleon also benefitted from the Bank of England's issuance of inconvertible banknotes, a \\"temporary\\" measure which remained from the 1790s until 1821.

It was transferred to the southern sector of the Eastern Front in March 1942. The 22nd was the last Panzer Division to be issued with the Czech-built Panzer 38(t), which was considered under-gunned, under-armoured and obsolete by 1942.  History  Officially formed on 25 September 1941 in France the division was initially equipped with obsolete Czech, French and German tanks.Mitcham, p. 164 The 22nd Panzer Division was sent to the Eastern Front in February 1942. After an initial disastrous attack on 20 March, in which the division's units lost 30-40% of their personnel, the division remained in the Crimea and took part in Manstein's Unternehmen Trappenjagd (Operation Bustard Hunt). In May 1942, the division was sent north to the Kharkov area and then took part in the 1942 summer offensive against Soviet forces in the Don River bend leading to the Battle of Stalingrad. The 22nd fought in the Battle of Rostov in July 1942.Mitcham, p. 165 Together with the 1st Romanian Armoured Division (equipped with the also obsolete R2, similar to Panzer 35(t)), the 22nd Panzer Division comprised the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps and was next tasked with defending the northern flank of the ill- fated German 6th Army at Stalingrad. Lieutenant General Ferdinand Heim was the corps commander. On November 19, 1942, Operation Uranus began. The great Soviet counter-offensive encircled the German 6th Army and much of the 4th Panzer Army and smashed the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, including the 22nd Panzer Division. Many of the division's tanks had been parked in dugouts for an extended period of time and protected from the frost by straw. When the tanks were called on to respond to the Soviet offensive, many could not be started because mice had sought refuge in the straw and then in the tanks where they chewed up the insulation of electric system wires. The ability of the division to put up effective resistance was also compromised by the prior piecemeal deployment of division assets to shore up the Romanian line. According to Beevor, the division had as few as 30 serviceable Panzer 38t's with which to meet the onslaught of the T-34s of the Soviet 1st Tank Corps. Contradictory orders directing the panzers in two different directions only aggravated an already hopeless situation. After desperate fighting around the Russian town of Petshany 19–22 November 1942, the 22nd was virtually destroyed with survivors making their way southwest to and across the river Chir to join various ad hoc Kampfgruppen. For its part, the Romanian 1st Armored Division lost 60% of its combat strength and crossed the Chir River with only nineteen of its original eighty four serviceable R-2s. The 22nd Panzer Division was subsequently disbanded in April 1943. General Heim of the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps was relieved of command and retired in disgrace, only to be recalled to active duty in 1944 to command the hopeless defense of Boulogne, France.

History New Jack and Kronus joined forces after New Jack's partner Mustapha Saed and Kronus's partner Perry Saturn both left ECW. Their first match together was on August 21, 1997, when they defeated ECW World Tag Team Champions the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a non-title match. This led to a series of matches between the teams, during which New Jack and Kronus defeated the Dudleys for the title belts at ECW's \\"As Good as it Gets\\" event on September 20, 1997 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They successfully defended the belts against the Dudleys and the team of Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney over the following month. The Gangstanators held the title until October 18 of that year, when they lost to The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and Tracy Smothers) in Philadelphia. After losing the title, The Gangstanators continued their feud with the Dudleys. Spike Dudley also entered the feud on the side of the New Jack and Kronus, fighting against his kayfabe brothers. He joined The Gangstanators in six-man matches and sometimes took Kronus' place as New Jack's partner. As the year went on, Kronus, New Jack, and Spike Dudley focused more on their singles careers, although they still teamed with each other on occasion.

After RCA was acquired by General Electric in 1986, GE began marketing sets identical to those from RCA. GE sold both RCA and GE consumer electronics lines to Thomson SA in 1988. RCA televisions with the Colortrak branding were mid-range models; positioned above the low-end XL-100 series but below the high-end Dimensia and Colortrak 2000 series. RCA discontinued use of the Colortrak name in the late 1990s, replacing it with the Entertainment Series. Design quirks During the early 1980s, RCA responded to increased demand for component televisions with monitor capabilities by adding composite and S-video inputs to the Colortrak lineup. These inputs allowed owners to easily connect a stereo audio/video source, like a Video Cassette Recorder, LaserDisc player, or with use of an RCA SelectaVision CED videodisc players to the television. For example, early composite video-equipped RCA sets were to coincidentally be tuned to Non- broadcast channel 91 to display a composite video signal, if a set was equipped with more than one input, subsequent inputs are designated to channels 92 to 95, which are usually accessed from the remote control. Later models abandoned this design, favoring A/V inputs which were accessible by pressing the channel up/down buttons, or A/V inputs which were controlled by their own button. =Tuner Issues= After Thomson SA acquired the GE and RCA brand names, they began designing a new chassis for RCA and GE televisions, which debuted in 1993 models. Instead of using a tuner module soldered to the circuit board, Thomson decided to integrate the tuner into the board itself. Due to the heating and cooling cycles of the circuit board and tuner from normal use, the solder connections between the tuner and the board would fail, causing an intermittent picture or no signal from the coaxial connector. This is easily repairable by desoldering the tuner shield and re-flowing new solder to each connection inside. After each connection has been soldered, the tuner shield can be soldered back in place.

He is best known for his appearances with Smokey Mountain Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling in the 1990s. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1991–1994)= Mustafa was trained as a professional wrestler by Gene Anderson. He made his debut on the August 18, 1990 episode of WCW Worldwide teaming with Scott Williams in a match against WCW World Tag Team Champions Doom.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw90.htm He would make his singles debut against J.W.

Over the following years made appearances with the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling as a jobber. = Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994–1995) = In 1994 at Smokey Mountain Wrestling, the pairing of Saed, New Jack and, for a brief time, D'Lo Brown were collectively known as The Gangstas. A controversial gimmick, the Gangstas would cut promos about activist Medgar Evers and O.J. Simpson to infuriate the southern white crowd, they would also use fried chicken and watermelons as props and would win matches via only a two count rather than the conventional three count purportedly due to Affirmative Action. The Gangstas would feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express for several months in case of the SMW Tag Team Championship which they would eventually win on October 3 but would lose the titles back the Rock 'n' Roll Express two months later. After the loss, the Gangstas would feud with teams such as Tony Anthony and Tracy Smothers and The Heavenly Bodies. In 1995 The Gangstas, now consisting of only Saed and New Jack, left SMW in a controversial fashion which escalated the long-standing dispute between Paul Heyman and Jim Cornette. = Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995–1997, 1999) = Making their Extreme Championship Wrestling debut on June 27 at Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams, and their Hardcore TV debut on July 20, the Gangstas would quickly become faces and a draw for ECW, regularly bringing weapons such as guitars, crutches and staple guns in trash cans and shopping carts to the ring. The Gangstas would enter a lengthy feud with the Public Enemy that would last until the beginning of 1996 where the Public Enemy would beat the Gangstas in a street fight. Several months later the Gangstas would feud with the Eliminators, challenging them for the ECW World Tag Team Championship on several occasions before finally winning them on August 3 at The Doctor Is In. Although they lost the titles several months later in December, they would become two-time champions on July 19, 1997 at Heat Wave. Following the loss of the second championship, Saed split with New Jack and left ECW. Saed would return to ECW on February 12, 1999 at Crossing the Line '99 in Queens, New York. Mustafa reunited with New Jack to battle the Dudley Boys, only for Mustafa to attack his partner, revealing himself as the mysterious benefactor who wanted to run the Public Enemy and New Jack out of ECW. Now known as Mr. Mustafa, he would be defeated by New Jack at Living Dangerously 1999 and leave the company again by May. =Independent circuit (1997–present)= Saed would wrestle for the top Puerto Rican promotion, World Wrestling Council between 1999 and 2001 where he would win the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship once, the WWC World Television Championship once and the WWC World Tag Team Championship once with Rastaman. In 2000, Saed would go on his first and only tour of Japan with Big Japan Pro Wrestling where he participated in the World Extreme Cup 2000. After WWC, Saed wrestles mostly on the independent circuit for promotions such as All Pro Wrestling, Portland Wrestling and Sacramento Wrestling Federation. On August 8, 2010, Saed and New Jack reunited for a single night at the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay- per-view Hardcore Justice, assaulting Team 3D and Joel Gertner after a match.

After California became one of the United States, Pico was elected to the state Assembly and Senate. He was appointed as the commanding brigadier general of the state militia during the U.S. Civil War. Early life Andrés Pico was born in San Diego in 1810 as a first-generation Californio. He was one of several sons of José María Pico and María Eustaquia López. An older brother was Pío Pico, who twice served as governor of Alta California.\\"Soldiers of the 1775 Anza Expedition\\", 1912, California Spanish Genealogy. Retrieved on 2008-08-05 Ranchero In 1845 under the law for secularization of former Church properties, his older brother Governor Pío Pico granted Andrés Pico and his associate Juan Manso a nine-year lease for the Mission San Fernando Rey de España lands, which encompassed nearly the entire San Fernando Valley. At that time a 35-year-old rancher, Andrés Pico lived in Pueblo de Los Angeles. He ran cattle on the ranch and used the mission complex as his hacienda. He gave Rómulo Pico Adobe to his son. In 1846, to raise funds for the Mexican–American War, the Pío Pico government sold secularized mission lands. The Mission San Fernando was sold to Eulogio de Celis, who established Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. Celis returned to Spain, but his descendants stayed in California. Under the terms of secularization, the sale excluded the Mission compound and its immediate surroundings, which were reserved for Don Andrés.\\"Andreas Pico Adobe\\" , The Branding Iron, December 1976, Number 124; reprinted by the San Fernando Valley Historical Society, 1977; accessed 11 October 2011 In the Mexican–American War During the Mexican–American War, Andrés Pico commanded the native forces, the California Lancers, in Alta California. In 1846 Pico led an attack on forces commanded by U.S. General Stephen Watts Kearny at the fierce but inconclusive Battle of San Pasqual. He is sometimes confused with his older brother Pío Pico, who in 1847, was elected as the last Governor of Alta California.Andrés Pico was never governor of the state. On January 13, 1847, as the acting governor of Mexican Alta California (while his brother was in Mexico raising additional money for the fight against the United States), Andrés signed the Treaty of Cahuenga with the American commander Lieutenant- Colonel John C. Frémont, with whom he became friends.http://www.sfvhs.com/andres_pico_adobe/andres_pico.html On January 13, 1847, Andrés Pico approached the U.S. commander Lieutenant-Colonel John C. Frémont, man to man and alone. Without firing a shot, Don Andrés and Frémont agreed to the terms of the Ceasefire of Cahuenga, an informal agreement that ended the war in California, in exchange for promises of protection of California from abuses by Fremont's forces; this was confirmed by the Treaty of San Fernando, formalized at the mission. Frémont agreed to stop burning Californian ranches, stop stealing horses and cattle, and to obey the positive laws of the country. Kearny, the commanding U.S. general, heard of the Treaty, he gave his consent. Peace reigned. Post-statehood activity In 1853, Don Andrés acquired a half interest in Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando from Eulogio de Celis; it was split along present-day Roscoe Boulevard, with his brother Pio Pico's land being the southern half of the San Fernando Valley to the Santa Monica Mountains. After statehood, in 1851, Don Andrés was elected to the California State Assembly from Los Angeles. Because of perceived anti- Californio sentiments in San Francisco, Don Andrés authored what was known as the Pico Bill in February 1859, to partition California into two states—north and south. The bill proposed to create the \\"Territory of Colorado\\" from the southern counties of the state. The bill passed both houses of the state legislature and was signed by the Governor John B. Weller on April 18, 1859. But the U.S. Congress never voted on the bill because of the outbreak of the Civil War.William Henry Ellison, \\"The Movement for State Division in California, 1849-1860,\\" The Southwestern Historical Quarterly XVII, no. 2 (October, 1913), 139. U.S. Congress approval was required before the proposed partition could be put to a vote of the people. In 1858, Pico was commissioned as a Brigadier General in the California Militia. In 1860, he was elected by the state legislature as a California State Senator from Los Angeles. Andrés Pico's Rancho ex-Mission San Fernando was confiscated by federal decree in 1864, which said that he \\"did not own and never did own\\" it. Reduced to a pauper, he retired as a Californio ranchero in Los Angeles. Ex-Mission San Fernando fell into ruins until the mid-20th century, when the Roman Catholic Church conserved about one fourth of the old mission quadrangle. Since Don Andrés' death, the bulk of the old mission has never been restored. The site of the main mission buildings are now occupied by a parochial high school, including the old, monumental front facing east toward the former Fort Tejon Road. The sites of the Butterfield stagecoach stables, and the outbuildings and storage buildings of Don Andrés' ranch and hacienda, have been lost under development of the modern urban community of Mission Hills. Pico married Catarina Moreno, grand daughter of Jose Cesario Moreno, Los Angeles pobladore in San Diego. Had one son Romulo, and adopted a daughter, also named Catarina. Legacy * His son's home, the Andrés Pico Adobe, is the oldest residence in the San Fernando Valley.

Psychology  While an earned sense of entitlement is usually seen as more beneficent than purely psychological entitlement, it can also have a destructive counterpart in the sense of a felt entitlement to revenge based on the accumulation of grievances.Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, Between Give and Take (2013) p. 110 Psychoanalysis differentiated among children three main varieties of the sense of entitlement: normal; inflated; and compromised.Vamik Volkan, Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy (2014) p. 36 The inflated sense of entitlement sought special privileges for the individual alone, perhaps to compensate for childhood suffering or narcissistic injury; while the compromised sense involved an inability to expect the basic rights enjoyed by those around one.Vamik Volkan, Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy (2014) p. 36 A normal or healthy sense of entitlement included an expectation of responsiveness from significant others,A. Goldberg, Advances in Self-Psychology (2013) p. 25 a sense of agency, and a sense of one's right to one's own feelings - all forming positive elements in self- esteem.E. Ronningstam, Identifying and Understanding the Narcissistic Personality (2005) Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy distinguished in adult life between (ethically) earning entitlement in relationships, through care and consideration, and a subjective feeling of entitlement the real basis for which may be very different.Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, Between Give and Take (2013) p. 109-10 Thus the depressive may have an unjustifiably low sense of entitlement, the manic an exaggeratedly high one.Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, Between Give and Take (2013) p. 164 The gambler may feel entitled to expect a big win, to compensate for childhood deprivation; those who clamour most loudly for such reimbursement from fate may in fact unconsciously doubt their entitlement to anything at all.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis.

(Who was Velocio?) (Lu 678 fois) Pages Person - Velocio profile- February 27, 1930), was the publisher of Le Cycliste, a developer and early champion of derailleur gears, and father of French bicycle touring and randonneuring. Background De Vivie was born at Pernes-les-Fontaines, France. His youth was unremarkable except for a love for the classics. His father was a prosperous Gascon with links to the nobility. He came from Saint-Germain-de-la-Sauvetat and worked as the head of post. His mother, Marthe Roman, came from Arles. Paul de Vivie lived at Tarascon, Meyzieu, and studied at Lachassagne, near Lyon until 1870. De Vivie went into the silk industry as an apprentice and then opened his own business in St-Étienne before he was 30. He married in St-Étienne in 1876. He lived at 6 rue Brossard. He bought his first bicycle, a penny-farthing when he was 28, in 1881. In that year he became the founding secretary of Les Cyclistes Stéphanois.A stéphanois is a native of St-Étienne, Étienne being French for StephenBaud, Jean-Pierre (1994), Du Nouveau sur Vélocio, Cyclotourisme, Fédération Française de Cyclotourisme, France no 420, September 1994 The club held its first meeting at 1 rue des Arts, St-Étienne, on 23 October 1881. The address was the home of a member, A. Jourjon, and became the club's address when it was registered as a new organisation at the préfecture on 11 March 1882. Evidence that de Vivie was a reasonably prosperous man is shown in a club rule that allowed membership only to amateurs, a definition which excluded ordinary working men.The argument, which nearly kept two English cyclists, Frederick Keeping and Edward Battell, out of the first of the modern Olympic Games was that only a gentleman had enough money not to need prizes. Therefore only a gentleman could be an amateur. Further evidence is the writer Jean-Pierre Baud's calculation that a bicycle cost 200 francs or 56 times the daily wage of an everyday worker. Club membership cost 17 francs the first year and 12 francs in subsequent year. Membership was open not only to those who pedalled but others who preferred machines \\"furnished by steam, electricity and any other propulsion.\\" A friend challenged de Vivie to ride his new bicycle 100 km in six hours and he set out to the mountain resort of Chaise-Dieu. The peace, adventure and countryside changed his life - and persuaded him he needed a better bike. A year later he bought a Bayliss tricycle, followed by a tandem tricycle and others. His work in the silk industry required trips to England and it was there, in Coventry, then the centre of the world cycle industry, that he was inspired by British bicycles and joined the Cyclists' Touring Club. In 1887, he sold his business, opened the Agence Générale Vélocipédique in St-Étienne to import bikes from Coventry, and began a magazine, Le Cycliste Forézien, renamed Le Cycliste the following year. Campaign for multiple gears The English Whippet, of which de Vivie used a gear. De Vivie imported machines from England. In 1889 he made a bike of his own, called La Gauloise. It had a diamond frame, chain and a single gear. De Vivie was riding the col de la République (10 km south east of St Etienne) in 1889 when one of his readers overtook him - smoking a pipe.Cycle, UK, undated cutting De Vivie felt challenged but also trapped: if he lowered his gear, he would go slower on the flat. But on the gearing that he had, he could not climb hills fast enough either. British thinking favoured epicyclic and planetary gears, concealed in the rear hub. De Vivie created the derailleur. His first had two chain wheels; the chain had to be lifted by hand from one to the other. He then placed two chain wheels on the left side. The combination gave him four gears. In 1901 Velocio combined his invention with the four-speed proteon gear of the English Whippet, which used a split chain wheel. Pedalling backwards made the two halves of the chain wheel open. Pawls then secured them in one of four positions. De Vivie's development appeared in his Cheminot in 1906, the first derailleur. He overlooked taking out a patent and made barely any money from an invention which changed cycling. It has been said that de Vivie invented something which already existed, in Britain, and simply made the derailleur better known. The col du Grand Bois or de la République Traditional cyclists did not appreciate his gears. The organiser of the Tour de France, Henri Desgrange, dismissed them in L'Auto as fit only for invalids and women. De Vivie campaigned for his invention and rode every morning up the col de la République for the joy of passing riders without them. The Touring Club de France organised a challenge in 1902 in which a female rider, Marthe Hesse, participated riding a Gauloise with a three-speed derailleur. Hesse was one among only four riders crossing the Tourmalet without setting foot to the ground. Desgrange, though, wrote: :\\"I applaud this test, but I still feel that variable gears are only for people over 45. Isn't it better to triumph by the strength of your muscles than by the artifice of a derailleur? We are getting soft. Come on fellows. Let's say that the test was a fine demonstration - for our grandparents! As for me, give me a fixed gear!\\" De Vivie's invention is in the museum of art and industry at St-Étienne. His friend, Albert Raimond, developed the idea and started the Cyclo gear company. Raimond, like Vivie, was fond of hilly rides. Advocacy for small wheels De Vivie was also an early advocate of tires of up to 57mm (2.25 in) cross- section on rims as small as 500mm (20 in), preceding modern advocates of small wheel bicycles such as Alex Moulton. In 1911 he wrote: :\\"My own experience has gone no further than to 50cm wheels furnished with 50mm tyres, but I can guarantee that in an experiment extending as far as 15,000km covered, they will not have the smallest disadvantage from the point of view of their running. It simply seems to me they are more prone to skidding, but this is perhaps because their tyres have no tread and that the bicycle is very short. That universal agreement has fixed on 70cm as the proper size for wheels does not in any way prove that this diameter is best; it simply proves that cyclists follow each other like sheep. :Make no mistake, uniformity is leading us directly towards boredom and towards routine, whilst diversity, even though it distracts us, holds our attention, our interest and the spirit of enquiry always on the watch. To change is not always to perfect, and I know that better than any others newly come to cyclo-technology. But to stand still, to sink into a rut, that is the worst of things for industries and for men.\\"Velocio, Le Cycliste, France, 1911 - English translation commissioned by Tony Hadland, see article at www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~hadland/page15.html Velocio died at St-Étienne, France. His obituary in the Gazette of the Cyclists' Touring Club pictured him with an open-framed small-wheel bicycle. Writing Vélocio wrote of his tours in a language that inspired a nation - France - in which holidays with pay were unknown: :A shaft of gold pierced the sky and rested on a snowy peak, which, moments before, had been caressed by soft moonlight. For a moment showers of sparks bounced from the pinnacle and tumbled down the mountain in a heavenly cataract. The king of the universe, the magnificent dispenser of light and warmth and life, gave notice of his imminent arrival. But only for an instant. Like a spent meteor, the spectacle dissolved in the sea of darkness that engulfed me in the depths of the gorge. The glistening reflections, the exploding fireballs were gone. Once again, the snow assumed its cold and ghostly face. Or again: :After a long day on my bicycle, I feel refreshed, cleansed, purified. I feel that I have established contact with my environment and that I am at peace. On days like that I am permeated with a profound gratitude for my bicycle. Even if I did not enjoy riding, I would still do it for my peace of mind. What a wonderful tonic to be exposed to bright sunshine, drenching rain, choking dust, dripping fog, rigid air, punishing winds! I will never forget the day I climbed the Puy Mary. There were two of us on a fine day in May. We started in the sunshine and stripped to the waist. Halfway, clouds enveloped us and the temperature tumbled. Gradually it got colder and wetter, but we did not notice it. In fact, it heightened our pleasure. We did not bother to put on our jackets or our capes, and we arrived at the little hotel at the top with rivulets of rain and sweat running down our sides. I tingled from top to bottom. Death and memorial De Vivie was a vegetarian, a speaker of Esperanto and a strict man who started every day of his later life by reading ancient Greek. On February 27, 1930, the last words he read were from Seneca to Lucius: :Death follows me and life escapes me. When I go to sleep, I think that I may never awake. When I wake up, I think that I may never get to sleep. When I go out, I think that I may never come back. Then he collected his bike and began pushing it across the road. He stepped back to avoid a car and was hit and killed by a tram. His memorial is at the top of the col de la République. Its inscription reads: \\"Paul de Vivie, alias Vélocio (Pernes 1853 - St-Étienne 1930). Apostle of cycle-touring and promoter of gears [changements de vitesse]. Monument erected by the town of Pernes-les-Fontaines on the 150th anniversary of his birth. Inaugurated 20 April 2003.\\"Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old-Timers, UK, April 2005 He coined the French term cyclo-tourisme, which continues in use. He is buried in the cemetery at Loyasse, near Lyon. His plaque reads: \\"To their venerable master, the cyclo-tourists of St-Étienne.\\" A road is named after him in St-Étienne. The American writer Clifford Graves said in May 1965: :Velocio's influence grew, not because of his exploits on the bicycle, but because he showed how these exploits will shape the character of a man. Velocio was a humanist. His philosophy came from the ancients who considered discipline the cardinal virtue. Discipline is of two kinds: physical and moral. Velocio used the physical discipline of the bicycle to lead him to moral discipline. Through the bicycle he was able to commune with the sun, the rain, the wind. For him, the bicycle was the expression of a personal philosophy. For him, the bicycle was an instrument in the service of an ideal. For him, the bicycle was the road to freedom, physical and spiritual. He gave up much, but he found more. e cret See also * French bicycle industry References External links * List starting with Velocio's 1912 Le Chemineau derailleur.

It was established in 1983 with support of the Lions Club of Australia and headquartered in the suburb of , Western Australia. The LEI is a not-for-profit centre of excellence that combines an ophthalmic clinic with scientific discovery developing techniques for the prevention of blindness and the reduction of pain from blinding eye conditions. History At a 1970 convention in Albany, Western Australia, the Western Australian Lions Clubs created the Lions Save Sight Foundation (WA) Inc. with the aim of leading the development of ophthalmic care. In 1975 the Lions Save-Sight Foundation (LSSF) established the Lions Chair in Ophthalmology at the University of Western Australia. Since its establishment, clinical facilities, new equipment, and research laboratories have been strategically commissioned to support the LEI's core activities. In 1983, under Professor Ian Constable's guidance, the LEI, a not- for-profit organisation was established. With Constable, the LEI became an international centre for scientific research into blindness. Following its development, it relocated to the grounds of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. Its current Managing Director Bill Morgan leads a team of clinicians, medical professionals, researchers and support staff. In 1994, the Institute created in partnership with the University of Western Australia, the Centre for Ophthalmology and Visual Science (COVS). This centre has an independent University status within the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry. In 2003, the LEI revised its basis of incorporation from a public benevolent charitable institution to a not-for profit limited liability company. Overview The LEI employs scientists, clinicians, and support staff to conduct scientific research into blindness with known ophthalmic practices in Australia. The Institute also includes a Laser Vision Centre, Western Australia's refractive surgery centre; the Lions Eye Bank, Lions Outback Vision, Lions Optics and the LSSF. The LEI actively participates in numerous clinical trials for the development of new treatments for eye diseases, in collaboration with scientists, ophthalmologists, and pharmaceutical companies. The Institute receives funds from clinic operations and its grants from organisations such as the National Health and Medical Research Council, individual benefactors and the LSSF. Services The LEI provides a range of services including standard clinical services, LASIK surgery at the Lions Laser Vision Center, cataract micro-surgery and lens implantation, plastic surgery of the eyelids and full optometric service at Lions Optics. The Lions Eye Bank collects and distributes corneal tissue, scleral tissue and supplies thousands of corneal transplants throughout Western Australia. The Institute initiated the Pilbara Aboriginal Eye Health Program, a strategy targeting indigenous people who suffer from diabetes and associated blinding eye diseases prevalent within the Aboriginal population. As part of the Australian Government aid to the Indonesian Government, In July 2007, the LEI was instrumental in setting up the Bali Mandara Eye Hospital which was handed over to the Indonesian Government on 13 October 2015. The LEI provides open consultations and health education seminars in cooperation with several organisations including Glaucoma Australia, Retinitis Pigmentosa Society of Western Australia, Macular Degeneration Foundation and the Australian Foundation for the Prevention of Blindness. Its ophthalmologists also consult at Perth's main teaching public hospitals including Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Royal Perth Hospital and Fremantle Hospital. Research Activities The LEI teams investigate all major causes of blindness including cataracts, diabetes related eye disease, glaucoma, retinal degenerations, corneal, and immune-based diseases. More than 70 scientists at the LEI use a range of technologies to develop treatments for blinding diseases, including gene therapy and telemedicine. The LEI has national and international institutional partnerships including American Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Shanghai University, Swedish University of Agricultural Science, University of Missouri and the National Eye Institute (USA). For example, the LEI participates in joint research and development projects with the American Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, University of Missouri and the National Eye Institute (USA). Research carried out by the Institute teams led to the first retinal vein bypass treatment of blockages, and the development of the first transgenic mouse model for Age-Related Macular Degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for people over 55. This model is expected to accelerate the development of ARMD leading to an effective treatment. At the LEI, the first artificial cornea, the AlphaCor was developed and implanted into a human eye. The LEI is acknowledged as a core academic centre involved in clinical trials of new pharmaceutical therapies and surgical procedures before government approval. For example, the Xen Gel Stent, an implantable transcleral microsurgical device developed at the LEI was approved for use in the US by the FDA in 2016.

They were best known for their tenure in Extreme Championship Wrestling, where they were one-time Tag Team Champions. In addition to tag team success, both members were each one time Television Champions as well. History =World Wrestling Federation= In 1989, Wolfe and Durante wrestled briefly in the World Wrestling Federation, losing to The Hart Foundation on March 4, 1989. They also lost to The Brain Busters on June 27, 1989 and the Fabulous Rougeau brothers on Primetime aired on 25 September 1989. =South Atlantic Pro Wrestling and New Japan = In 1990, Wofle and Durante went to South Atlantic Pro Wrestling as the American Bulldogs and later renaming themselves the Pitbulls. They defeated the Nasty Boys for the tag team titles. In 1991 they went to New Japan Pro Wrestling as the Mad Bull Busters. They stayed there for a year. =Extreme Championship Wrestling= The Pitbulls debuted Extreme Championship Wrestling in April 1992 both competing in battle royals to crown the first ECW Heavyweight Champion. Neither were successful. Durante left shortly after, Wolfe, became known as \\"the Pitbull\\", won the Television Championship on April 16, 1994. Later 1994, Wolfe and Durante, who became \\"Pitbull #2\\", reunited The Pitbulls and had notable feuds with Public Enemy and the Bad Breed, the feud with the Bad Breed cumlminated at the November to Remember in a match where the Losing team was forced to split up. The Pitbulls were victorious. The Pitbulls won their first and only Tag Team Championship on September 16, 1995 at Gangstas Paradise from Raven and Stevie Richards. They were soon joined by Francine, who became their manager and dubbed herself \\"The Beastmaster\\". One month later, they lost the titles back to Raven and Richards. In 1996, The Pitbulls moved into an intense feud with The Eliminators, which saw their manager Francine receive the Total Elimination on two occasions. The feud culminiated at the first-ever CyberSlam in a three-on-three dog collar match, which saw Francine team with the Pitbulls against Stevie Richards with The Eliminators. The Pitbulls won the match after superbombing Richards and letting Francine pin Richards. However, The Eliminators hit the Total Elimination on Pitbull #1, Pitbull #2, and Francine after the match. After this, Pitbull #2 went on to win the ECW Television Championship on June 1 at the Fight the Power event; he held the belt for only 21 days before losing it to Chris Jericho at Hardcore Heaven. On July 13, 1996 at Heat Wave, Francine turned on The Pitbulls and became the manager of Shane Douglas. The feud between Douglas and The Pitbulls culminated on April 13, 1997 at the first ECW pay-per-view Barely Legal, where Pitbull #2 faced Douglas for the Television Championship in a losing effort. =Independent circuit= After leaving ECW, The Pitbulls began competing on the independent circuit. Pitbull #2 began a brief singles run, which included one-time reigns as the MEWF Heavyweight Champion and the second-ever JAPW Heavyweight Champion, both of which ended via title vacation due to injuries. The team returned to the tag team division as they debuted in the National Wrestling Alliance's New Jersey territory, where they won the NWA United States Tag Team Championship on two occasions in 1998 and 1999 and remained the title's final champions upon the title's deactivation 2000. They lost to the Headbangers on WWF Shotgun Saturday Night on August 24, 1998.

A substance believed to be the painkiller oxycodone was found in the house but it was officially announced that he overdosed on the painkiller fentanyl. He and his girlfriend were found after lying in their home dead for days, all while their two small children, a 21-month-old boy and an 8-month-old girl, were apparently alone in the house with the bodies. In 2005, Wolfe appeared at World Wrestling Entertainment's first-ever One Night Stand event to introduce the \\"ECW Remembers\\" video honoring the ECW alumni who had died, including his tag team partner Durante. After the death of Durante, Wolfe returned to the independent circuit and began competing for Pro Wrestling Unplugged as \\"The Pitbull\\" Wolfe, where he reused The Pitbull gimmick in honor of his late friend and tag team partner.

His early architectural career was in partnership with John Mead Howells. Stokes was a pioneer in social housing who co-authored the 1901 New York tenement house law. For twenty years he worked on The Iconography of Manhattan Island, a six volume compilation that became one of the most important research resources about the early development of the city. His designs included St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University and several urban housing projects in New York City. He was also a member of the New York Municipal Arts Commission for twenty-eight years and president for nine of these. Education and marriage He was educated at St. Paul's School, Concord, and Berkeley School in New York City before graduating from Harvard in 1891. He later took post graduate courses at the School of Mines, Columbia University and then Italy before studying for three years at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He married Edith Minturn — daughter of Sarah Susannah Shaw and Robert Bowne Minturn, Jr. — in 1895 at La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada. They lived in Paris whilst Stokes continued his studies. A friend sponsored their portrait Mr. and Mrs. I. N. Phelps Stokes, by John Singer Sargent, as a wedding gift. Edith also served as the artist's model for a well-known sculpture, Statue of the Republic by Daniel Chester French, and a portrait by Cecilia Beaux. She was President of the New York Kindergarten Association. She was the aunt of Edie Sedgewick, who was named after her. Architectural work 229 Madison Avenue, birthplace of Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes. Mr. and Mrs. I. N. Phelps Stokes, by John Singer Sargent, 1897 He founded an architectural firm, Howells & Stokes, with a partner, John Mead Howells, in 1897. Their first commission was the University Settlement Society building at 184 Eldridge Street, New York. Howells and Stokes were active in New York, but also opened an office on the West Coast in Seattle, designing many of the Metropolitan Tract buildings during the 1910s. The partners parted company on amicably terms in the mid 1910s. Their work had included the Baltimore Stock Exchange; University site development, Seattle; American Geographical Society Building, New York and the Turks Head Building, Providence. Howells continue to design skyscrapers, including the Tribune Tower and Daily News Building, New York, in collaboration with Raymond Hood. Stokes was appointed by his aunts, Caroline and Olivia Stokes, to design several of their charitable building projects. These included: the Tuskegee tenement building in New York (1901); St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University (1907); Berea College Chapel (1906); Woodbridge Hall at Yale (part of the Hewitt Quadrangle) (1901); two tenements called the Dudley complex at 339-349 East 32nd Street, New York (1910); an outdoor pulpit for St. John the Divine Cathedral (1916) and memorial gates at both Harvard and Yale universities, Hartford First Church Cemetery and Redlands Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in California. Howells and Stokes also provided designs for the Protestant College in Beirut, an institute supported by the Stokes and Dodge families. Caroline Stokes funded work at the Booker T. Washington Tuskegee institutes. The architect for these works was Robert Robinson Taylor, who was offered some professional advice by I. N. Phelps Stokes, but this proved to be unhelpful to Taylor who was working with limited resources. Stokes was involved with family owned property management companies, building and running apartment and office blocks in New York. In addition to his commercial work, he designed private housing such as Sanger Hill, a New York State country house for his cousin Colonel William Sanger; Beacon Hill House, Newport, Rhode Island for his uncle Arthur Curtiss James; Brick House, Collender's Point, Darien, Connecticut for his parents; and a house for his wife at Indian Harbor, Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1910, Stokes dismantled a large timber framed house, formerly the Queens Head, located next to what is now the A140 Ipswich to Norwich route in Thwaite, Suffolk, UK. He transported it in 688 crates from Tilbury Docks to the US, where it was re-constructed using the timbers of a wrecked English ship, on a hill overlooking Long Island Sound near Greenwich, Connecticut. It was renamed High Low House (one of its former names whilst standing in Thwaite). Public service Stokes was active in housing reform. He was appointed a member of the Tenement House Committee of the Charity Organisation Society in 1899, and was appointed a member of the State Tenement House Committee by Governor Roosevelt in 1901. He was a member of the Executive Committee and chairman of the Committee on New Building and in this role was a co-author of the Tenement House Law of 1901. He became a political ally and then a friend of New York Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia. During the New Deal, as head of the Art Commission, Stokes oversaw the WPA mural program for the City of New York, which sponsored murals at locations including the Marine Air Terminal at LaGuardia Airport, Harlem Hospital, and New York Public Library. At various times Stokes was director and president of the Phelps-Stokes Fund; trustee, New York Public Library; honorary vice-president, Community Service Society of New York, Fine Arts Federation of New York and President of the Municipal Art Commission of New York. Following the death of his wife he resigned many of his public duties. At his retirement from the Municipal Arts Commission in 1939, Mayor La Guardia said: “All through the city physical changes are being made, and a great deal of it is due to your vision and your perfect artistic style. Once in a while a modernistic piece has crept in on us, but it has been more than offset by your selections. All I can do is express my regret that you are leaving us.\\" The Iconography of Manhattan Island Stokes may be best remembered for an exhaustive and authoritative six volume work entitled The Iconography of Manhattan Island, published between 1915 and 1928. Stokes prefaced the first volume with the following objective: ::::\\"THE Iconography of Manhattan Island represents the result of a two-fold purpose: to collect, to condense, and to arrange systematically and in just proportion, within the confines of a single work, the facts and incidents which are of the greatest consequence and interest in the history of New York City, with special reference to its topographical features and to the physical development of the island; and to illustrate this material by the best reproductions obtainable of important and interesting contemporary maps, plans, views, and documents; in other words, to produce a book dealing with the physical rather than with the personal side of the city's history, which shall be at the same time useful and interesting to the student of history, the antiquarian, the collector, and the general public.\\" His initial thoughts were that the work would be covered in one volume, but he had underestimated and eventually six were required. In the last volume he wrote: ::::\\"It is more than nineteen years since work on the Iconography began, and all but thirteen years since the first volume was published. Clearly, the subscribers are entitled to an explanation - or to an apology. As an apology is, on the whole, the easier alternative, the author hastens to offer it - very humbly - and he sincerely thanks his subscribers for their considerate forbearance.\\" Whilst compiling the work, Stokes had become an obsessive collector and spent large sums with dealers in America and Europe. He bequeathed the prints from his collection to the New York Public Library, but financial hardship during the depression years forced him to sell many other works. Fire at Albany State Archive 1911 A fire started in the New York State Capitol at Albany in the early hours of 29 March 1911. The building housed the New York State Library, and it was feared that many historical documents were lost or damaged in the fire. The trustees of the New York Public Library asked I. N. Phelps Stokes to go to Albany and offer support. When he arrived he became involved with the salvage. He first surveyed the building to ensure it was safe for workers to enter. A preliminary inspection by Stokes and the archivist, Mr van Laer found that some documents still survived under the damage but urgent action was required to save them. Governor Dix arranged for soldiers to help and they formed a chain to carry salvaged papers and books to a place of safety. The fire continued to break out as they worked and to add to their problems the weather was so cold that water froze. It was estimated that 80% of the archive was lost in the fire. The night-watchman's body was also discovered in the rubble. Family Stokes was descended from New York merchants and bankers. His maternal grandfather, Isaac Newton Phelps, was born of farming stock and built his fortune from hardware and later banking. When he died in 1888 he left Stokes $100,000 dollars plus a part share in a legacy. His paternal grandfather, James Boulter Stokes, married Caroline, the daughter of Anson Greene Phelps and in doing so became the brother-in-law of William E. Dodge, Daniel James and Benjamin Bakewell Atterbury. All possessed of strong individualism but sharing a strong sense of social duty, driven by their religious beliefs. Many of their children and grandchildren were philanthropist, activists and missionaries. Stokes had eight siblings, they were: • Sarah Maria Phelps Stokes (1869-1943) who married Baron Halkett in 1890 and divorced in 1902. She wrote children's books under the name of Aunt Sadie. • Helen Olivia Phelps Stokes ( 1870-1945) who was an activist and painter. • James Graham Phelps Stokes (1872-1960) a noted socialist. • Rev. Anson Phelps Stokes (1874-1958) an educator and clergyman. • Ethel Valentine Phelps Stokes (1876-1952) who married philanthropist John Sherman Hoyt in 1895. • Caroline M. Phelps Stokes (1878-1964) who married Robert Hunter, sociologist and author. • Mildred Phelps Stokes (1881-1970) who married Dr Ransom Spafard Hooker. • Harold Montrose Phelps Stokes (1887-1970) who was on the New York Times and a free-lance author. Stokes and Edith Minturn did not have children of their own, but adopted a daughter in 1906. Edith died in 1937 after a debilitating illness. References Further reading * External links * I.N.

In five years, the band released three LPs, three EPs, and various singles and compilations. Laughing Clowns' sound is free jazz, bluegrass and krautrock influenced. The band formed to accommodate Ed Kuepper's growing interest in expanding brass-driven elements he had brought to The Saints' third album, Prehistoric Sounds, and by adopting flattened fifth notes in a rock and roll setting while using a modern jazz styled band line-up. Along with The Birthday Party, The Go-Betweens, The Moodists and The Triffids, the Laughing Clowns also spent extended periods in Europe during the early 1980s, and gained an international cult status. All four aforementioned groups have cited Laughing Clowns as an influence at some point in their respective careers. Early years 1979-81 Laughing Clowns were formed in April 1979 in Sydney as a rock, soul, avant-jazz group by Bob Farrell on saxophone, Ed Kuepper on lead guitar and lead vocals (ex-Kid Galahad and the Eternals, The Saints), Ben Wallace-Crabbe on bass guitar, and Jeffrey Wegener on drums (ex-The Saints, Last Words, Young Charlatans). In late 1978 Kuepper had quit punk rock band, The Saints, in London – where they had relocated from Brisbane – due to a rift with fellow founder, Chris Bailey regarding future direction . Kuepper preferred \\"less commercial, more cerebral material\\" as seen on the band's third album, Prehistoric Sounds (October 1978). When Kuepper returned to Australia in 1978 he had contemplated retirement, however he reconnected with two old school friends, Farrell and Wegener, at a party and they coaxed him into forming a new band. Both Farrell and Wegener had associations with The Saints: Wegener was an early member in 1975 and Farrell was one of the Flat Top Four, which performed backing vocals on \\"Kissin' Cousins\\" for that band's debut album, (I'm) Stranded (February 1977). Ben Wallace-Crabbe had played in a Melbourne band, The Love, with Wegener, and completed the initial line-up. A proposed single by The Saints, \\"Laughing Clowns\\" / \\"On the Waterfront\\", through EG Records was not recorded by that group due to the difference of opinion between Kuepper and Bailey. Each track appeared elsewhere: \\"On the Waterfront\\" on The Saints' first post-Kuepper EP, Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow (March 1980) and \\"Laughing Clowns\\" provided Kuepper's new band's name and their self-titled six-track mini-album in May that year. Laughing Clowns made their public debut in August 1979, immediately encountering both confusion and antipathy from The Saints' fans who expected a more abrasive punk sound. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted that \\"Part of the problem was that the band's sound defied categorisation. Having to overcome such ludicrous labels as 'jazz-punk' ... [it] was diverse yet moody, at turns melodic or dissonant. It ranged from rock and soul to avant- jazz\\". The Saints' Prehistoric Sounds had not received a local release via EMI until 1979, so Laughing Clowns performed various tracks from that album in their early sets – including \\"The Prisoner\\" and \\"Swing for the Crime\\". Later in the year, Ben's cousin and former guitarist in the Melbourne-based version of Crime & the City Solution as well as The Love, Dan Wallace-Crabbe, joined the group on piano. Missing Link in May 1980. The EP's cover art is by Robin Wallace-Crabbe. This five-piece incarnation recorded Laughing Clowns at Richmond Recorders in Melbourne with production by Kuepper, and engineering by Tony Cohen. All six tracks were written by Kuepper. Released via Missing Link, it gained favourable reviews in the Australian independent music press. McFarlane opined that the EP was \\"unlike any other [record] made in Australia to that point. The music's only parallel lay in latter-day Saints as a logical progression from Prehistoric Sounds, but at the same time it was a departure, a foray into new territory. The open-ended song arrangements were stirring and provocative, but also disconcerting. The production values were cavernous and echoey; a fascinating sound, but very cold and detached\\". A promotional video for one of its tracks, \\"Holy Joe\\", was filmed. Upon the EP's release, they expanded to a six-piece group with Peter Doyle on trumpet. This configuration performed at the Paris Theatre in Sydney in November 1980, with The Birthday Party and The Go-Betweens; this was to be the last gig with Farrell. Ben also left the group before the year's end and his cousin, Dan followed within a few months. Ben subsequently formed Upside Down House, and later committed suicide. The group's second release, a three-track EP, Sometimes, the Fire Dance...., appeared on the Prince Melon imprint in February 1981 – a label run by then-manager, Ken West, and Kuepper. The label name 'Prince Melon' was the nickname the band had for West. This EP had been recorded in mid-June 1980 with the six-piece line-up, again with Cohen engineering, but the whole group produced it. Jonathan Green of The Canberra Times felt the EP had \\"[s]uper songs, especially the A side, which strikes the odd emotional chord (sob), from one of the most challenging bands in the country. Apparently poppy, with an underlying and sinister atonality\\". In March 1981 the band released a third EP, Laughing Clowns 3, with five tracks. In July the two Prince Melon EPs were combined to create their first compilation album, Throne of Blood/Reign of Terror. The line-up of Doyle, Kuepper and Wegener continued as a three-piece exploring much freer arrangements, and drawing from the band's mutual interest in free jazz. By mid-1981 they gained Louise Elliott on saxophone and flute and Leslie 'Bif' Millar on fretless and upright bass guitar. With this new line-up, the band delved further into jazz-inspired improvisation and experimentation. Mr Uddich-Schmuddich Goes to Town 1982 In March 1982 Laughing Clowns issued its debut album, Mr Uddich-Schmuddich Goes to Town. It had been recorded in November of the previous year and was produced by Doyle, Kuepper and Wegener; engineered by Doyle and Peter Walker (ex-Bakery guitarist). It showed a change of approach with the addition of Millar's jazz- schooled bass playing. Much like the work of Captain Beefheart, the seemingly improvisational elements are predetermined by Kuepper, the band's primary songwriter, except the LP's title track. Jim Green, of TrouserPress, summarised the group's history and described this album as displaying \\"a shift in the lineup brought in a new saxman and bassist (playing acoustic stand-up) and dropped the pianist. The tracks are more succinct, and the overall impression is that of consolidation and retrenchment\\". Alex Griffin of Life is Noise website lists it as one of his Top Australian Albums, \\"Despite sounding like it was recorded inside Ed’s cavernous, musty trachea, the songs are paranoid and shifting, propelled as ever by Jeffrey Wagoner’s drumming which sounds like a jittery dinosaur in a Chinese tea room\\". Soon after its release the band, except Doyle, relocated briefly to Europe and recorded a session for John Peel which appeared on a four-track EP, Everything That Flies Is not a Bird, released in 1983. By the end of 1982, the group had temporarily split due to internal tensions, and Wegener joined The Birthday Party for a tour of the Netherlands early the following year. Law of Nature 1983-1984 Kuepper reformed Laughing Clowns in May 1983 with Elliott and Wegener but without Millar. They added Peter Milton Walsh (ex-The Apartments) on bass guitar. Walsh had not played bass guitar in a band before; he appeared on the group's second album, Law of Nature. It was recorded during the latter half of 1983 in Sydney and released in April 1984 on the newly formed label, Hot, and included contributions from pianist Chris Abrahams. A single, \\"Eternally Yours\\", was released on 12\\" in March and a promotional video was made to promote it. The group started a national tour, The Canberra Times correspondent noted gig giveaways included \\"Free flexi-discs of the band's new single, 'Eternally Yours', which will include one unreleased track, ... to the first 300 people passing through the door. Albums and 12inch giveaways are on the agenda\\". The line-up were \\"well-established\\" with Kuepper, Wegener, Elliot, and Walsh. The album employs the recording of dual acoustic and electric guitar tracks, and a more song-based approach. The Canberra Times reviewer, Debbie Muir, noted its \\"innovative, though frankly bitter, style that's not punk or new wave or straight rock but just its unpretentious self\\". She praised the lead single as \\"The best track by far... [it] conveys an atmosphere of drooling sadness ... the extended single version is much, much better\\" than the album's version. McFarlane praised the album and its lead single as being \\"amongst the band's very finest works. There were moments of great beauty on Law of Nature such as 'Law of Nature', 'Written in Exile' and 'Eternally Yours', where Elliot's soulful and epic sax riff danced majestically in the air\\". After a national and European tour in support of the album, Walsh departed to reform The Apartments and Paul Smith replaced him as bassist.  Ghosts of an Ideal Wife and break-up 1984-1985 Laughing Clowns were expanded with the addition of Glad Reed on trumpet, Dianne Spence on saxophone, and Louis Tillett on piano. In October 1984 they began recording Ghosts of an Ideal Wife, at Alberts Studios. By Christmas of that year, the band split after international and national tours, with Kuepper finishing the album, early in 1985. A posthumous single, the double A side \\"Just Because I Like\\" / \\"Crystal Clear\\" was released in February 1985 via Hot Records. Shortly after disbanding Elliott and Wegener briefly joined The Saints for an Australian tour. Kuepper began work on his debut solo LP, Electrical Storm (June 1985). Much of the Laughing Clowns' saga was recounted in the book, Stranded: The Secret History of Australian Independent Music 1977–1991 (1996), by Australian rock music writer, Clinton Walker. Walker had been a confidante of the band and one of its outspoken critical champions. In September 2005 Tim Ritchie of Radio National reviewed their 3× CD compilation album, Cruel but Fair (The Complete Clowns Recordings), and described their style as \\"so singular, so 'not part of the trends' that they would either have people walking out of gigs in droves, or have them swear they were witness to something akin to greatness\\". The anthology was released on 3 October 2005 to further critical acclaim, Donat Tahiraj of Time Off magazine declared they were \\"the most inventive and innovative Australian band of the post-punk era\\".  Afterwards and reformation  In 2004 Kuepper and Wegener performed together on Ed Kuepper's MFLL project, a live presentation of soundtracks to short films which toured Australia and Europe, including a show at the Cartier Foundation. Subsequently, Wegener joined Kuepper's touring band, The Kowalski Collective, and appeared on his concept album, Jean Lee and the Yellow Dog (September 2007). A version of The Laughing Clowns was re-formed, only for purposes of playing live. In 2008 Kuepper restarted the Prince Melon record label, and in March of the following year released a live album, Prince Melon Bootleg Series Volume 7: Laughing Clowns Live. The concert was at The Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane with a line-up of Elliott, Kuepper, Millar, Wegener and Alister Spence on keyboards. This line-up also played the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in May 2009, curated by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and an eastern states tour. The band toured Australia in January 2010, again, as a part of All Tomorrow's Parties' Don't Look Back series of shows supporting Dirty Three. For the tour Laughing Clowns performed their 1984 compilation, History of Rock 'n' Roll Volume One, in its entirety. Prince Melon issued two further live albums in 2010.

Beginning in the 1960s, performers like the Clancy Brothers became stars in the Irish music scene, which dates back to at least the colonial era, when many Irish immigrants arrived. These included many Scots-Irish Presbyterians, whose music was most \\"closely related to a Lowland Scottish style\\" . The most significant impact of Celtic music on American styles, however, is undoubtedly that on the evolution of country music, a style which blends Anglo-Celtic traditions with \\"sacred hymns and African American spirituals\\". Country music's roots come from \\"Americanized interpretations of English, Scottish and Scots-Irish traditional music, shaped by African American rhythms, and containing vestiges of (19th century) popular song, especially (minstrel songs)\\" . Celtic-Americans have also been influential in the creation of Celtic fusion, a set of genres which combine traditional Celtic music with contemporary influences. Traditional Music in the US Irish traditional music in the United States has a long and varied history, both in recording culture and by live performances. Emigrants from Ireland have brought their instruments and repertoire to the United States since the earliest days of European colonization of the New World. The history of Irish musicians from Ireland taking up residency in New York and beyond is one side of the story. Another is the learning and playing of Irish music by first and second generation Irish-Americans. And then yet another is the widespread interest in the music by Americans from every background. Masters of the tradition have come to live in the United States. Chief O'Neill in Chicago was a major promoter of musicianship and tune collection, greatly impacting the tradition beyond his own day and place of re-settlement. In the late nineteenth century and long after that, Patsy Touhey from Loughrea was a popular touring artist. In the 1920s and 1930s, the classic recordings of Irish traditional music were made in New York by Michael Coleman, Packie Dolan, Hughie Gillespie, Jim Morrison and many others. This recording culture continues to the present day. In the wake of the Depression and World War, Irish traditional music in New York was belittled by showband culture, and performers like Jack Coen, Paddy O'Brien of Tipperary, Larry Redican, and Paddy Reynolds kept the tradition alive in the United States, and were teachers of the music to Irish Americans. Many great Irish American performers like Andy McGann, Brian Conway, Joannie Madden, Jerry O'Sullivan, Liz Carroll and Billy McComiskey would rise to achieve a level of accomplishment in the traditional music usually associated with native Irish. Later Irish emigration to New York and beyond by James Keane, Mick Moloney, Paddy Keenan, Paddy O'Brien of Offaly, Martin Hayes and others through the 1960s, 1970s and 80s, ensured the music performed in America stayed connected to Ireland. Recent emigration by Ivan Goff and Cillian Vallely to New York has kept the stream of native players strong, and the American scene rich with native talent. While Irish American players like Patrick Mangan continue to prove Irish American culture is strongly connected to the roots. Many Welsh songs have been adopted into American music culture, such as \\"Ar Hyd y Nos\\" (\\"All Through the Night\\", performed by Sheryl Crow, among others); \\"Suo Gân\\" (featured in the film Empire of the Sun), and \\"Lisa Lân\\" (featured in the film Crash). Irish American Music Irish immigrants created a large number of emigrant ballads once in the United States. These were usually \\"sad laments, steeped in nostalgia, and self-pity, and singing the praises... of their native soil while bitterly condemning the land of the stranger\\" . These songs include famous songs like \\"Thousands Are Sailing to America\\" and \\"By the Hush\\", though \\"Shamrock Shore\\" may be the most well known in the field. Francis O'Neill was a Chicago police chief who collected the single largest collection of Irish traditional music ever published. He was a flautist, fiddler and piper who was part of a vibrant Irish community in Chicago at the time, one that included some forty thousand people, including musicians from \\"all thirty-two counties of Ireland\\", according to Nicholas Carolan, who referred to O'Neill as \\"the greatest individual influence on the evolution of Irish traditional dance music in the twentieth century\\" . In the 1890s, Irish music entered a \\"golden age\\", centered on the vibrant scene in New York City. This produced legendary fiddlers like James Morrison and Michael Coleman, and a number of popular dance bands that played pop standards and dances like the foxtrot and quicksteps; these bands slowly grew larger, adding brass and reed instruments in a big band style . Though this golden age ended by the Great Depression, the 1950s saw a flowering of Irish music, aided by the foundation of the City Center Ballroom in New York City. It was later joined by a roots revival in Ireland and the foundation of Mick Moloney's Green Fields of America, a Philadelphia-based organization that promotes Irish music . During the late 20th century came the rise of Celtic inspired rock groups like Flogging Molly, who reside in Los Angeles, Black 47 from New York City, The Shillaly Brothers, also from Los Angeles and the Dropkick Murphys from Boston. Celtic Identity through Music In America Dynamic identities contribute to Benedict Anderson’s notions of nationalism and nationality. The Celtic identities constructed in America contribute to the dynamic being of American nationalism that we are founded upon. Freedom, a foundational principle of American society, was encouraged by the Celtic influence in Appalachia through their contribution to Union forces during the Civil War. The Union was a more democratizing entity and more willing to accept pluralism in American society compared to their Confederate counterparts who were more bent on maintaining a separatist identity According to Benedict Anderson, “nationality” was formed from the accumulation of cultural artifacts that were able to be transplanted to an array of environments and societies and merge with a wide variety of political and ideological frameworks. This imagined nationality as Benedict calls it, is a constantly shifting and dynamic entity. “It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow members, yet in the mind of each lives the image of their communion.” (Anderson, 6). Celtic identity is one such imagined community. The diaspora of Celts from other areas of the world to America is representative of the imagined community. The cultural diaspora from the British Isles, specifically Scotland and Ireland, landed primarily in the Appalachian region of the United States. Thousands of immigrants sailed and maintained and improved on agricultural pursuits to better improve their lives. The British brought with them cultural elements such as music, dress, and ideology. Among these Brits were those defined as Celts, or people who resided in or spoke the languages of Ireland, Wales, Scotland, or Brittany. The Celtic identity is complex: A large portion of this Celticness rested on musical practices, both spoken word and instrumental, that constructs the distinct identity. Layered regional and national identities were assembled over time in the Celtic-speaking world, centered on practices of both modern and historic Celtic instruments. American Bluegrass and Folk music styles have roots in Appalachian cultures linked to Scottish, Irish, or Celts. Layers of American identity were constructed by the influence of a new musical style. Culture was formed and community was created. Regional identity flourished. This concept of nation building in America is particularly true for the Scots and stems in part from the vast territory that led to development of family autonomy, or Clans, in Scotland and influenced the role of the individual. New layers of identity were created by the influx of Celts to America. Identity is composed of characteristics and values that contribute to individuals and communities. Identities combine to form a distinct sense of nationalism. Michael Dietler asserts that Celtic identity, which rose within Celtic speaking regions such as Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and Brittany, is itself an “imagined community” possessing its own nationalist ideals constructed from regional and individual cultural identities. The sense of nationalism that Celts possess is what Dietler refers to as Celticism, “self-conscious attempts to construct ethnicized forms of collective memory and communal identity that are territorially bounded and imbedded in overt political projects and ideologies.” (Dietler 239). He continues to define Celtitude as the feeling felt by those who draw ethnic ties to Celtic life. They feel a sense of ethno-nostalgia for Scottish or Irish heritage. Celticity is centered on a global spiritual connection to the idea of Celtic identity. This is composed of people who wish to identify as something other than white. Dietler’s theories on identity suggest that music and cultural identities have overlapped. Celtic styles merge with other styles and move toward a role as “World Music”: many can relate to world music and Celtic styles create solidarity among those who wish to identify as Celtic.

The Björk-Shiley valve is a mechanical artificial heart valve. The valve was co-invented by American engineer Donald Shiley and Swedish heart surgeon Viking Björk. Beginning in 1971, it has been used to replace aortic valves and mitral valves. It was the first successful tilting-disc valve. It was manufactured first by Shiley Laboratories, then later by Pfizer after that company purchased Shiley. One model of the Bjork-Shiley valve became the subject of a famous lawsuit and recall after it was shown to malfunction. Construction The Björk-Shiley valve consists of a single carbon-coated disc in a metal housing. The disc is held in place by two metal struts, an inflow and an outflow strut. The housing is made from the alloy Haynes 25, which is composed of 51% cobalt, 20% chromium, 15% tungsten, and 10% nickel. The Björk-Shiley valve was considered very durable and was widely used in the 1970s. However, later research indicated it was susceptible to long-term wear problems, and could shed microscopic metal fragments. Convexo-concave valve defects Attempts to improve the design of the valve and speed manufacturing, however, led to a weaker structure, with serious consequences. Beginning in 1979, Björk-Shiley valves with the convexo-concave design had a tendency to develop fractures in the outflow strut which could result in catastrophic valve failure and possibly sudden cardiac death. Later analysis revealed that the strut was fracturing at the place where it was welded onto the metal valve ring. One end of the strut would fracture first, followed by the second strut some months later. Eventually, 619 of the 80,000 convexo-concave valves implanted fractured in this way, with the patient dying in two-thirds of those cases. The FDA withdrew approval of the convexo-concave valve in 1986. Valves welded by specific welders were at greater risk of fracture. The convexo-concave valve was withdrawn from the market and multiple lawsuits were filed. In 1992, Pfizer (Shiley's parent company) and patients with defective valves agreed to a settlement, with Pfizer proposing a fund of $80 million to $130 million in compensation, and to aside $75 million for research to identify recipients of heart valves with a significant risk of fracture. The eventual settlement totaled $215 million. A separate part of the agreement required Pfizer to provide up to $300 million for patient or survivor claims in the event of valve fractures. Not all of these valves have been removed and replaced. The risk of valve fracture has been balanced against the risk of the surgery to replace the valve. Decision tools have been published and are available from a trust set up for this purpose during the litigation surrounding the valve \\"recall\\". The tools take into account patient age, the size and location of the valve (aortic or mitral) and other factors to come up with a recommendation as to whether surgery to replace the valve is worthwhile. In some patients the risk of surgery to replace the valve is higher than the risk of the valve fracturing. A fund was also established for patient compensation and to pay for the costs of heart surgery to replace the valve. More recent models of the Björk-Shiley valve did away with the convexo-concave design and are reliable valves that do not require replacement.

The issue arose in relation to frauds conducted by the late Robert Maxwell. The appeal was not actually an appeal on the full decision, but an appeal to determine a preliminary issue: specifically whether the proper law to determine the issue was English law or New York law. Macmillan argued that the main issue was a claim in restitution, and so the proper law to determine the issue was English law. The respondent banks argued that the main issue was who had title to the shares, and so the proper law to determine that issue was New York law. The trial at first instance on the full facts ([1995] 1 WLR 978, before Millett J) had taken \\"the best part of a year, from October 1992 to July 1993\\".[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 393B The respondent banks won at first instance and upon appeal. Facts Macmillan Inc was a company incorporated in Delaware, and which was controlled by Robert Maxwell It owned a majority shareholding in Berlitz International Inc, a New York company. Under the direction of Maxwell the shares in Berlitz were transferred to Bishopsgate Investments Trust plc (a company owned and controlled by Robert Maxwell and his family[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 394B) as its nominee. Then, without MacMillan's consent or knowledge, the shares were mortgaged by Bishopsgate to secure loans from three different financial institutions to fund Maxwell's private interests. Accordingly, although it was named as the first defendant in the action, Bishopsgate played little part - the main dispute was fought between Macmillan and the banks who had loaned money to Robert Maxwell on the strength of the Berlitz shares as collateral. The central issue in the case was who had better title to the shares: MacMillan as beneficiary under a trust, or the financial institutions as mortgagees. The key to determining these issues was deciding which was the proper law to determine title to the shares. The only previous case relating to this issue (Colonial Bank Ltd v Cady and Williams (1890) 15 App Cas 267) had been decided over a century before, followed by an \\"astonishing period of legal barrenness in judicial and academic consideration\\". However, in the present case the issue was complicated by the fact that many of the shares were held indirectly through a securities depository, Depository Trust Company. At first instance, after an extremely lengthy trial, Millett J held that the proper law to determine priority of claims was the lex loci contractus which was New York law. Accordingly, the banks prevailed. Macmillan appealed against the decision, and it was agreed to hear the appeal as to what the proper law to determine the issue was as a preliminary point. The case was conducted largely under the assumption was that if New York law determined title, then the banks would win because they had no actual notice of wrongdoing. But if English law determined title, then Macmillan had an arguable case that the banks had constructive notice of Robert Maxwell's fraud on the grounds they ought to have known he was engaging in fraud when he caused the shares to be mortgaged for the benefit of loans to his private businesses. Judgment =First instance= The matter came before Millett J at first instance. It was an enormous trial, lasting over a year. There were 53 witnesses, and the pleadings alone ran to over 1,000 pages.Christopher Forsyth, ‘Characterisation Revisited: An Essay in the Theory and Practice of the English Conflict of Laws’ (1998) 114 LQR 141 at 160. At the end of his judgment, Millett J castigated the complexity and expense in relation to the way the arguments were put: > The trial began on 26 October 1992. It finished on 30 July 1993. But even > that was not the end: further evidence was adduced by consent in November > 1993. Since the trial began the subject matter of the action (Berlitz) and > the plaintiff (Macmillan) have both been sold; one defendant (Credit Suisse) > has been taken over by another (Swiss Volksbank); and Macmillan's parent > company, M.C.C. has emerged under a plan of reorganisation approved by the > New York Court. The pleadings filled nearly 1,000 pages. They obscured the > issues. When I asked for the issues to be clarified, the parties could not > agree what they were. Witness statements were obtained from 53 witnesses, of > whom 36 gave oral evidence and were cross-examined, many of them at > considerable length. Opinions on foreign law were obtained from 12 > witnesses, almost all of whom were cross examined at length. Documents in > the case filled more than 120 lever arch files. The experts' reports on > foreign law with accompanying authorities filled 24 files. The parties' > opening and closing submissions with accompany authorities filled a further > 40 files. Much of this was unnecessary. There was a huge amount of > duplication and unnecessary elaboration.[1995] 1 WLR 978 at 1013G-1014B. At the conclusion of the trial, Millett J issued a lengthy judgment, which was only partially reported in the law reports. Regrettably, for brevity key parts of the decision relating to recharacterisation (which were not challenged on appeal) were left unreported.Joanna Benjamin, ‘Recharacterisation risk in the conflict of laws’, (1997) 12 JIBFL 513 (footnote 21). In relation to the issue which engaged the Court of Appeal, Millett J followed the House of Lords' decision in Colonial Bank v Cady and Williams (1890) 15 App Cas 267, and held that the proper law to determine the validity of the transfer was the law of the place of the transfer (the lex loci actus), which was New York law. =Court of Appeal= All three judges in the Court of Appeal gave reasoned decisions. One of the most common criticisms of the decision is that although all three judges agreed as to the outcome (that New York law applied), they all gave different reasons - and all of their reasons were different from that of the trial judge. Staughton LJ The first decision was given by Staughton LJ. He indicated that in relation to a conflict of laws problem, the court essentially has a three-stage problem: > There are in essence three issues before us, corresponding to the three > stages in a conflict case which I have mentioned. They are: (a) how does one > characterise the question in this action? (b) What connecting factor does > our conflict rule provide for questions of that character? (c) What system > of law does that connecting factor require to be applied?[1996] 1 WLR 387 at > 393G He then summarised the facts and reviewed the issues each in turn. In relation to Stage 1 (characterisation), Macmillan contended the claim relating to restitution (unjust enrichment), and so the issue should be decided in accordance with Rule 201, sub-rule (c) of Dicey & Morris (12th ed.). In the context of this case, that would result in the application of English law, as the law of the place where the enrichment occurs. However he rejected that characterisation - the issue was not whether the banks were enriched - it was whether they had a good defence to the return of the shares. In that case it was not a question of characterising the claim, but characterising the core issue.[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 399C In relation to Stage 2 (choice of law) he held that the relevant law was clearly that of the lex situs of the property, and cited various authorities in support including Winkworth v Christie Manson and Woods Ltd [1980] Ch 496 and Inglis v Robertson [1898] AC 616. But he noted that those cases related to goods, and that the same rule applied in relation to negotiable instruments. However, in relation to intangible property such as choses in action, the usual rule was the priority was determined by the proper law of the chose in action, not its situs (citing Dicey & Morris (12th ed.), Rule 123). He then considered whether shares have \\"a rule of their own\\". He noted that the evidence of American law (as the law under which the company who issued the shares was incorporated), shares were not negotiable instruments (following Williams v Colonial Bank sub nom Cady (1888) 38 Ch D 388 at 403). He reviewed Cady in some detail and confessed to finding it difficult to draw the boundaries between the issues being discussed.[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 404E Then with slightly abrupt suddenness he held: > I conclude that an issue as to who has title to the shares in a company > should be decided by the law of the place where the shares are situated (lex > situs). ... and in this case, that is the law of the place where the company > is incorporated. There may be cases where it is arguably the law of the > place where the share register is kept, but that problem does not arise > today. The reference is to the domestic law of the place in question; at one > time there was an argument for renvoi, but mercifully (or sadly, as the case > may be) that has been abandoned.[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 405B He then went on to consider Stage 3 (system of law). He held that \\"[w]hether it be situs, place of incorporation or place of share register, the answer is the law of and prevailing in the State of New YOrk.\\"[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 405C Auld LJ The second (and shortest) judgment was given by Auld LJ. He opened by summarising the issue as \\"Who has the better right to ownership of shares in a corporation?\\"[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 405C He also noted that Macmillan framed this issue as a claim for restitution, but the banks asserted it was an issue of priority of claims in relation to an asset. He reviewed the recent cases in what was called \\"receipt-based restitutionary claims\\" and referred to academic articles which cautioned about how new developments in domestic law should be treated when applying historical choice of law rules.Adrian Briggs, 'Restitution Meets the Conflict of Laws' [1995] RLR 94 at 97. He noted that the usual rule in relation to property claims was to apply the lex situs, and then expresses doubts as to whether choice of law based on restitutionary claims is advisable in this case. He noted that the claim for unjust enrichment was difficult in any event, as the banks gave full value. He eventually concluded that \\"even if the facts could support a claim for unjust enrichment, it is the issue that determiend the matter. As I have said, it is essentially a proprietary one\\".[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 409A He rejected the view of the trial judge that the lex loci actus was applicable to the issue. Turning to the issue of what the lex situs of shares was, he review the authorities which he felt were unsatisfactory. He stated that: > In my view, there is authority and much to be said for treating issues of > priority of ownership of shares in a corporation according to the lex situs > of those shares. That will normally be the country where the register is > kept, usually but not always the country of incorporation. If the shares are > negotiable the lex situs will be where the pieces of paper constituting the > negotiable instruments are at the time of transfer.[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 411D He then also reviewed Cady and distinguished it. He affirmed that the proper law to determine the issue was New York law. Although he did not explicitly reject renvoi he stated that the proper law was \\"the domestic law of New York.[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 413H (emphasis added) Aldous LJ The third and final judgment was given by Aldous LJ.Curiously counsel for one of the banks in the case was Richard Aldous QC, who was the brother of Aldous LJ. After setting out the facts again in some detail, he also affirmed that Macmillan had argued its case on the basis that English law was the proper law to determine the issue as the issue before the court was one of restitution. Conversely the banks argued that this was an issue as to who had the better priority to the shares as a matter of property law. As with the other judges in the Court of Appeal, Aldous LJ felt that this was an issue of property law. He held: \\"The issue being one of priority, the law having the closest and most real connection must be New York law. That is the law which governs the right in dispute, namely the right to be placed on the register.\\"[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 419F He went on to expound: > I have no doubt that the transferability of shares in a corporation, the > formalities necessary to transfer them and the right of the transferee to be > registered on the books of the corporation as the owner of the shares are > all governed by the law of incorporation.[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 419H He then proceeded with his own review of Cady (which he asserted supported his position). He also cited a long string of North American decisions relating to the issue. He then concluded: \\"I believe the appropriate law to decide questions of title to property, such as shares, is the lex situs, which is the same as the law of incorporation.\\"[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 424F =Overview= Although the case is often held up as being determinative of the lex situs of a share in a company, and/or as determining that the doctrine of renvoi does not apply to intangible property, neither of those points were actually in issue in the case. Macmillan argued for an entirely separate choice of law issue relating to a different characerisation. And the comments of the Court of Appeal in relation to the situs of shares all agreed that they were located in New York, but expressed somewhat different views as to why that was so. The decision that renvoi was not applicable was similarly not argued, as both sides were content that any reference to a foreign law should solely be to the domestic law. Similarly, neither party argued for a different choice of law rule on the basis that the shares were held through intermediaries rather than directly held.Maisi Ooi, ‘Intermediation and its effect on investor rights’ (2015) 131 LQR 536 In relation to whether different issues applied to shares that were negotiable, again the court did not speak with one voice. Both Staughton and Auld LJJ expressed the view that negotiable shares were subject to a different choice of law rule - the law of the place where the relevant certificates were located. But they differed in their judgments as to which law should determine whether shares were negotiable or not: Staughton LJ indicating it was the lex fori and Auld suggesting it was the law of the place where act of negotiation occurs. Ooi rejects both as incorrect.It is clear that for at least some negotiable instruments, it will be the place of negotiation, see Bills of Exchange Act 1882, section 72. She favours the view of Aldous LJ who implies that the situs of a share, even when negotiable, is the place of the company's incorporation. Reception The case broadly received a mixed reception from commentators. It is accepted as authoritative in relation to its approach to characterisation. However its rejection of renvoi is not seen as completely definitive.Relatively little argument was addressed to the Court of Appeal on renvoi. However renvoi was a live issue in the trial at first instance, and was rejected by Millett J (see first instance decision at [1995] 1 WLR 978 at 1008C-G). Against that decision there was no appeal. In relation to the main subject for which the case is normally cited, the situs of shares in a company, Dicey Morris & Collins accept it as good authority, but note that it has to be read against a large group of cases which seek to impose a different situs in different situations for different purposes. Hill treats it as largely authoritative with respect to the choice of the lex situs, but refrains from commenting upon the identification of the situs for shares. In that regard it is hard to treat it as a definitive statement of the law. Maisie Ooi in her definitive work on the subject expresses discomfort in relation to the parts of the judgment which refer to the situs of shares being determined by the place of the register. Subsequent decisions The Supreme Court endorsed the decision in . Notably Lord Sumption summarised its effects as \\"transmission of property is governed by the lex situs, which in the case of registered shares is the law of the company's incorporation... This proposition is well established and was not seriously disputed: see Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust Plc (No 3) [1996] 1 WLR 387.\\" (at para [80]). Lord Mance also referred to the decision with approval, but did not comment specifically on the lex situs of shares. The case was also cited as authoritative for its proposition in relation to the choice of law process in In Tomlinson J suggested that the conflicting decisions in Macmillan as to the situs of the shares are actually misconstrued. In his judgment he noted that: > The reasoning in Macmillan cannot of course be understood without paying > careful attention to the characterisation of the issue to which it was > directed. Thus if transfer of shares may be effected only by registration on > a particular register, the shares must inevitably be regarded as situate at > the place where the register is kept for the purpose of ascertaining the > efficacy of any purported transfer. However for the purpose of ascertaining > the priority of competing proprietary or security interests falling short of > registered ownership, only Auld LJ in the Court of Appeal seemed to regard > the law of the place where the register is kept as significant – see [1996] > 1 WLR 387 at 411E. In that case however the place of incorporation, the > place where the share certificates were at the time of the relevant > transactions and the place where the share register was kept were all the > same, New York, so the point did not need to be decided. In other words, the issue of situs depends upon the purpose. For a transfer it is (or may well be) the place of the register. But for the purposes of priority of title, it is the place of incorporation. This also accords with some older judicial decisions such as Brassard v Smith [1925] AC 371 which indicated: \\"there are ... so many qualities of a share which are attributable to different places it would seem to follow that there cannot be a proper local habitation for a share at all.\\" Criticism There have been various criticisms of the judgment, although not all of them are universally supported. * Certain academics were highly critical of the decision for its unceremonious rejection of the doctrine of renvoi.Adrian Briggs, ‘In Praise and Defence of Renvoi’, (1998) 47 ICLQ 877 However other academics endorsed that as removing the \\"onerous, expensive, and time-consuming\\" enquiries that the doctrine results in. * In each case the judges entirely overlooked the fact that the relevant shares were held in a depository system, which most lawyers consider changes the nature of the property for choice of law purposes. However, this may be because of the way that the case was pleaded and argued.In the next round of the litigation Macmillan did argue for a different choice of law rule based on the fact the shares were held by intermediaries: * But the most common criticism is that in reach three different analyses which led to the same result, it is extremely difficult to tell what the authoritative ratio decidendi of the case is.

It is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Name Ribnica was attested in written sources in 1220 as Rewenitz (and as Reiwencz and Reifenitz in 1241, Reiuenz in 1263, Reyuinz in 1303, and Reyfniz in 1327). The name was originally a hydronym derived from the common noun riba 'fish', thus referring to a stream with many fish and, by extension, a settlement along such a stream.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 354. In the past, the settlement was known as Reifnitz in German, and in the local dialect it is known as Rîbənca. History Archaeological evidence shows that the area has been settled at least since the late Bronze Age between 1300 and 900 BC. It is first mentioned as Rewenicz in written documents dating to 1220, making it one of the oldest towns in Slovenia.Ribnica municipal site =Mass grave= Žiglovica Cave Ribnica is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Žiglovica Cave Mass Grave () is located northeast of the town, in a former hay field on a slope overgrown with grass and sparse woods. It contains the remains of 14 civilians from Prigorica, Žlebič, and Pri Cerkvi–Struge that were murdered on 28 July 1942. The men were abducted by a Partisan patrol while clearing woods along the railway. Some of the victims were thrown into the shaft alive, and one of them managed to pull a Partisan in with him. After the murders, the local Partisan political activist insisted that the men had merely been sent to White Carniola for punitive labor, but the murders were acknowledged by some of the Partisan participants.\\"Pričevalci\\" (Interview with Alojz Arko). 2014.

Ernest Ikoli, the first editor of the Daily Times of Nigeria, which was launched in June 1926, was another founding member. Immediate concerns included the supposedly inferior status of Yaba College, appointments of Africans to senior positions in the civil service and discrimination against African truck drivers. However, the Lagos-based organization at first had generally moderate views and pledged to support and cooperate with the governor. The president was Dr Kofo Abayomi. Ernest Ikoli was vice president and H.O. Davies was the secretary. It was the first multi-ethnic organization in Nigeria and its programme was to foster political advancement of the country and enhance the socio-economic status of the Nigerian citizens. Adeyemo Alakija later became President of the NYM. The movement acquired national outlook and became a strong national movement when Nnamdi Azikiwe and H.O. Davies returned to Nigeria in 1937 and 1938 respectively and consequently joined the movement. N.Y.M became the first authentic Nigerian nationalist organisation to be formed, Obafemi Awolowo and Samuel Akintola were other prominent members of the movement which membership was open to all Nigerians especially those resident in Lagos. Growing militancy When Nnamdi Azikiwe (\\"Zik\\") launched his West African Pilot in 1937, dedicated to fighting for independence from British colonial rule, the newspaper was an immediate success. Zik, an Ibo, found a ready-audience in the non-Yoruba people of Nigeria, including many in Lagos. He introduced Pan- African consciousness to the NYM, and expanded its membership with large numbers of people who had previously been excluded. H.O. Davies returned to Nigeria in 1938 from a spell at the London School of Economics (LSE), becoming a leading figure in the movement until he resigned in 1951. At the LSE, Davies had roomed with Jomo Kenyatta and had absorbed the socialist views of Harold Laski. In October 1938 the NYM fought and won elections for the Lagos Town Council, ending the dominance of Herbert Macaulay and the National Democratic Party. The newly self-confident members of the Nigerian Youth Movement objected to the system of indirect rule through traditional tribal leaders. The Youth Charter published in 1938 said: \\"We are opposed to the term \\"Indirect Rule\\" literally as well as in principle. Honest trusteeship implies direct British Rule with a view to ultimate self-government...\\". The Charter set out goals of unifying the tribes of Nigeria to work towards a common ideal, and educating public opinion to develop the national consciousness needed to reach this ideal. The goal was spelled out as complete autonomy within the British Empire on a basis of equal partnership with the other member states.

Each such chemical has at least one silicon-chlorine bond. Trichlorosilane is produced on the largest scale. The parent chlorosilane is Silicon tetrachloride ().. Synthesis =Hydrochlorosilanes= They are prepared by the Müller-Rochow process, which involves treating silicon with hydrogen chloride at elevated temperatures in the presence of a copper catalyst. The idealized equation is :2 Si + 6 HCl -> 2 HSiCl3 \\\\+ 2 H2, Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is the main product; dichlorosilane (H2SiCl2) and silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) are obtained as byproducts. The process was independently discovered by Eugene G.

They are key reagents in organosilicon chemistry. Reactions Chlorosilanes react with water to produce hydrogen chloride, giving siloxanes and eventually silicon dioxide. In the case of trimethylsilyl chloride, the hydrolyzed product is hexamethyldisiloxane: :2 ((CH3)3SiCl + H2O → [(CH3)3Si]2O + 2 HCl The analogous reaction of dimethyldichlorosilane gives siloxane polymers or rings: : n (CH3)2SiCl2 \\\\+ n H2O → [(CH3)2SiO]n \\\\+ 2n HCl Use Silicon tetrachloride and trichlorosilane are intermediates in the production of ultrapure silicon in the semiconductor industry. Chlorosilanes obtained from crude silicon are purified by fractional distillation techniques and then reduced with hydrogen to give silicon of purity. Organic chlorosilanes are frequently used as coatings for silicon and glass surfaces, and in the production of silicone (polysiloxane) polymers. While phenyl chlorosilanes and many others can be used, methylsiloxanes are produced in the greatest quantities. Methyl chlorosilanes have one to three methyl groups. In the case of dichlorodimethylsilane, two chlorine atoms are available, so that a reaction with excess water produces a linear chain of ether-like linkages between silicon atoms. As in polyethers, these flexible linkages produce a rubbery polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Trichloromethylsilane can be used to induce branching and cross-linking in PDMS molecules, while chlorotrimethylsilane serves to end backbone chains, limiting molecular weight. Other acid-forming species, especially acetate, can replace chlorine in silicone synthesis with little difference in the chemistry of the finished polymer. These analogues of chlorosilanes are quite common in the sealants and adhesives marketed to consumers, and as precursors for medical-grade silicone, because of reduced toxicity.

Murder Pasquale Barbaro and Moran were gunned down on 21 June 2003 at Cross Keys Reserve in Essendon, where they had been watching Moran's young children play football. On returning to their motor vehicle they were shot dead by a lone gunman. Security footage from a neighbouring hotel showed the van they had driven to the football grounds and a figure running away from the vehicle. Police feared that the murders would lead to further violence in the Melbourne underworld war. Father Joe Giaccobe, a friend of the Moran family officiated at Moran's funeral. During the service another priest, Father John Martin, said: :\\"Any funeral presents a challenge. Obviously, the church does not make judgements about the person. They need the prayers and whatever the church can do for them...They have to answer to God. We will not deny them.\\" Moran's father, Lewis Moran, was unable to attend the service due to incarceration at Port Phillip Correctional Centre. Authorities refused his request, for security reasons, to be released from prison to attend the service. Lewis Moran was later murdered while drinking in a Brunswick bar.Silvester and Rule (2004). Leadbelly, p. 173, On 28 February 2007, Carl Williams pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court of Victoria to the murder of Moran (but not of Barbaro). The actual shooting was done by a killer often known as the \\"Runner\\" with Williams having organised the killing. Williams was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 35 years, on 7 May 2007. He was later murdered while incarcerated at Barwon prison on 19 April 2010.

How Trish Stratus survived this I will never, ever know. was a professional wrestling tag team in the World Wrestling Federation, consisting of Test and Albert. T & A had Trish Stratus as their team manager, with their name being a pun on the initials of the two wrestlers and the slang expression \\"T&A;\\" (referring to tits and ass), spawning numerous coarse jokes on fan's signs and from commentator Jerry Lawler in reference to the buxom Trish Stratus. History Test and Albert met in Dory Funk, Jr.'s training center, the Funkin' Conservatory, where they were trained. Following this, both men took on individual careers in the business leading them to the WWF, where they were repackaged as a tag team during 2000. On the March 19, 2000 episode of Sunday Night Heat Stratus made her debut with the gimmick of scouting wrestlers to form a team. Shortly after this Test and Albert (who both wrestled on that show) became her wards. Their first match as a team was on the March 30 episode of SmackDown!, when they lost to the Hardy Boyz. Their first pay-per-view match was at WrestleMania 2000, when they defeated Steve Blackman and Al Snow. They competed against established teams in the WWF's tag team division, including Road Dogg and X-Pac, The Godfather and D'Lo Brown, and The Holly Cousins, before beginning a feud with the Dudley Boyz. In a match against the Dudley Boyz at the Backlash 2000 pay-per-view Stratus was the recipient of a powerbomb through a table from Bubba Ray Dudley, although T & A won the match. They continued competing against teams including the Hardy Boyz and the Dudley Boyz for the next few months, and on June 25, they competed for the WWF Tag Team Championship in a four-way elimination match at King of the Ring, but were the first team eliminated after Matt Hardy pinned Test. Test, Albert and Stratus began a feud with the Hardy Boyz, Matt and Jeff, and their manager Lita, which led to a six-person intergender tag team match at Fully Loaded, which T & A lost when Lita pinned Stratus. During a feud with the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA), the two men parodied the team under the name T & APA (Test & Albert Protection Agency). As part of this feud, all three members of T & A were supposed to face Bradshaw and Faarooq of the APA and Lita in a six-person tag team match on October 22, at the No Mercy pay-per-view, but T & A attacked the APA backstage, so the match never started. They then attacked Lita at ringside until the Hardy Boyz saved her. A feud with The Holly Cousins (Hardcore, Crash and Molly) followed, and at Survivor Series, the Holly Cousins, with Steve Blackman replacing Hardcore, defeated T & A in a six-person match when Molly pinned Stratus. In December 2000, Albert turned on Test, causing storyline internal injuries which resulted in bleeding from Test's mouth. Trish continued to manage Albert for a while, but eventually began a storyline involving Vince McMahon and eventually broke out as a wrestler on her own. Albert went on to join X-Pac and Justin Credible in their own stable, X-Factor. Test defeated William Regal to win the European title. He went on to feud with Eddie Guerrero over the European title before eventually joining The Alliance and later The Un-Americans. Test was released in November 2004 and returned in 2006 and left again in 2007. He died on March 13, 2009 in his Florida apartment. Albert was released in 2004, but returned in 2012 as Lord Tensai or just Tensai, and would become the head coach for the WWE developmental branch in 2014 NXT.http://pwinsider.com/article/93833/wwe-announces-two-appointments-in- running-nxtdevelopmental.html?p=1 References Category:WWE teams and stables ","title":"T &amp; A (professional wrestling)"},{"id":"2083754","text":"The Animal Protection and Rescue League (APRL) is an American grassroots animal rights organization, founded in 2003, based in California's San Diego and Orange Counties. APRL was founded in San Diego by animal rights activists Bryan Pease and Kath Rogers as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit national organization. Subsequently, the Orange County chapter of APRL was formed in Irvine California and is staffed entirely by volunteers that follow the same mission of animal rights as the national organization.  Activities and campaigns  = Thrift Store = The APRL thrift store was founded in February 2006. All proceeds from the store went to campaigns and programs to help animals through the Animal Protection and Rescue League. On July 9, 2017, the APRL Thrift Store closed, after a 10-year run as a nonprofit small business. = Cruelty- free Eating = Through APRL's GO VEGAN, College Outreach, and Vegan Outreach campaigns, volunteers distribute pamphlets to spread the word about the benefits of a plant-based diet to patrons at popular gathering spots like Downtown Disney, Knott's Berry Farm, The Outlets at Orange, the Irvine Spectrum, swap meets and college campuses. The organization estimates that for every 200 pamphlets distributed, one person goes vegan. That's 100 animals saved per year, or thousands over the course of a new vegan's life. APRL has given out hundreds of thousands of pamphlets and through this alone, they claim to have saved millions of animals' lives. = SoCal VegFest = The SoCal VegFest is run by dedicated volunteers as a project of Animal Protection and Rescue League. SoCal VegFest is a yearly event, normally in mid-fall, designed to engage curiosity and inspire consciousness in people of all ages. The event includes free plant-based food samplings, musical entertainment, guest speakers, cooking demonstrations, raffles, interactive booths, food vendors, humane organizations, an enjoyable children's area with a variety of engaging opportunities especially for kids, and more. The purpose of SoCal VegFest is to introduce Southern Californians and others to the benefits of healthy conscious living. Their stated goal is to inspire and support anyone who wants to learn more about living a more healthy, environmentally friendly, and compassionate life. = Ban Foie Gras = APRL's Stop Foie Gras campaign, has released groundbreaking video footage of extreme cruelty from all three foie gras farms in the U.S. and several in France. APRL was instrumental in passing legislation in California and Chicago against this cruelty. See www.banfoiegras.org for more info on this campaign. = Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty = APRL is a member of Californians for Humane Farms, a coalition of animal protection groups working to pass the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act—an initiative that will appear on California's November 2008 ballot. APRL led the signature gathering phase of the Yes on Prop 2 (Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act) campaign in Southern California. In 2017, APRL took part in the signature gathering phase of the updated Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act. = The GO VEGAN Billboard Campaign = APRL erected two billboards on December 30, 2014, next to the I-5 freeway in Los Angeles. Together, APRL estimates, they are getting 300,000 impressions per day, or 2 million impressions per week. It would be great to keep them up longer and move them around to increase their exposure. The Orange County chapter of Animal Protection & Rescue League (with assistance from PETA, which provided a generous grant) spent most of its annual budget already on the billboards and lacks the funds to keep them up. = Orange County Beach Cleanup = To protect marine animals from ingesting plastics and debris, which causes grave harm, APRL organizes monthly beach cleanups. They supply buckets, trash bags, gloves, reach extending sticks, and sanitizing wipes for volunteers to cleanup the Southern California beaches. Volunteers are asked to help clean up the beaches in the morning. Then at noon have a vegan lunch. = Protesting Animals Used in Entertainment = APRL protests rodeos, bull riding, animal circuses, sea world, and elephant rides. They work with local government to end the use of exotic animals and end all cruel practices at fairs and Zoos. = Aide Companion Animals = APRL save strays, educates about Spaying and Neutering pets, and promote pet adoption to reduce killing in the wild and in shelters. APRL has gotten many OC cities to ban the retail sale of dogs and cats and many pet stores to closes after advocacy and protest campaigns. = Helping the Catalina Harbor Cats = There is a colony of more than 30 feral cats living in the rugged landscape of Catalina (\\"Cat\\") Harbor on Catalina Island. Some of the cats have sustained permanent injuries from dog attacks and sadistic people. APRL started a fundraising campaign to provide needed services such as food, shelter, and medical aid. = Opposition to Kapparot = APRL protested killing of Kapparot chickens and sought legal actions. = Grant Program = Some of the other organizations APRL has supported: * Animal Outlook (formerly Compassion Over Killing) * Project Wildlife * Vegan Outreach * Synergy Animal Rescue  Legal advocacy  = Animal Protection and Rescue League et al. v.

On the demand side, it is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay; on the supply side, it is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a good or service. Reservation prices are commonly used in auctions, but the concept is extended beyond.  Description  In microeconomics, consumers set their reservation price as the highest price that they are willing to pay for goods or a service, while seller set the smallest price at which they would sell. Similarly, in finance, the reservation price—also called the indifference price—is the value at which an investor would be willing to buy (or sell) a financial security given his or her particular utility function. Reservation prices are commonly used in auctions, where the seller may or may not make it known what the lowest acceptable price is. Buyers—especially if by proxy—may have their own reservation price at which they are unwilling to further bid. This can be seen as the \\"walk away\\" point for either party, in negotiation where the reservation price is the point beyond which a negotiator is ready to walk away from a negotiated agreement. A seller may produce a reservation demand, which is a schedule of reservation prices at which a seller would be willing to sell different quantities of a particular good.  Analysis  Reservation prices vary for the buyers and sellers according to their disposable income, their desire for—or to sell—the good, and knowledge of information about substitute goods. A reservation price can be used to help calculate the consumer surplus or the producer surplus with reference to the equilibrium price.  Auction theory  In the basic model of optimal auction design developed by Roger Myerson (1981), the optimal reservation price (i.e., the smallest admissible bid) is independent of the number of bidders. Myerson assumes that the bidders have private independent values (i.e., each bidder’s valuation of the object to be auctioned off is a realization of a random variable observed only by the bidder, and the random variables are stochastically independent). For example, if every bidder’s valuation is drawn independently from a uniform distribution on the interval [0,100], then the optimal reservation price is 50. According to traditional economic theory, the optimal reservation price results from balancing two opposing effects. First, a higher reservation price is desirable for the seller since it deters bidders from falsely claiming that they have only a small valuation. Second, a higher reservation price is undesirable for the seller since it deters bidders with truly small valuations from participating in the auction. According to behavioral economic theory, a reservation price may also have additional effects. In particular, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (2007) have argued that a reservation price can serve as a reference point when bidders have preferences as studied in prospect theory.

BB&N; is regularly ranked among the top independent schools in the United States. The School has produced three of the 27 Presidential Scholars from Massachusetts since the inception of the program in 1964 and is a member of the G30 Schools group and the Round Square global education association. BB&N; includes six Rhodes Scholars among its graduates. The School occupies four campuses: a Lower School on Buckingham Street, a Middle School on Sparks Street, an Upper School on Gerry's Landing Road, and an office building on Belmont Street. In 2017 the school consisted of 1017 students, 146 faculty, and 148 administrators and staff. BB&N; was founded in 1974 from the merger of two schools, Browne & Nichols School and the Buckingham School. Prior to the merger, Browne & Nichols was a boys school consisting of grades 7-12; Buckingham School enrolled students in grades K-12: boys and girls in grades K-6 and girls only in grades 7-12. Federal judge Nathaniel M. Gorton is the former chair of the school's board of trustees. Origins Browne & Nichols School (B&N;) was founded in 1883 by George Henry Browne, a 25-year-old Harvard graduate who, having embarked on a career as a teacher of Latin and English literature, attracted the attention of his former professors Francis J. Child and Charles Eliot Norton. Seeking an alternative to the Cambridge public schools, Child and Norton recruited Browne to teach their three sons and two other boys. At the end of that year, Browne enlisted his Harvard classmate Edgar H. Nichols to join him as the co-head of a new college preparatory school, which opened in the fall with an enrollment of 17, a number that quickly expanded. The Buckingham School was named and incorporated in 1902, but the first schoolhouse was opened in 1892, known as Miss Markham's School after its founding headmistress. Because Jeanette Markham had been conducting classes for small children in a private school since at least 1889, that is the year from which Buckingham dates its beginning. Markham came to Cambridge from Atchison, Kansas to pursue an education at the recently founded women's college later named Radcliffe. Upon arriving in Cambridge, she found a home with Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson on Buckingham Street, to whom she is said to have become \\"virtually an elder daughter\\" (59). After she began teaching in a neighbor's home, another neighbor, Mrs. Richard H. Dana, offered to build a schoolhouse and living quarters nearby, where the school began with 12 students. That schoolhouse continues to be part of BB&N;'s Lower School campus to this day. School buildings and campuses Upper School During the year 1882–1883, before Browne & Nichols came into formal existence, founder George H. Browne taught his small group of students in two rooms in Harvard's Felton Hall. With the formation of the school in 1883, instruction took place at 11 Appian Way, with the addition of another building at 8 Garden Street. Radcliffe College, which now occupies this land, wished to expand here, and so it made an exchange with B&N;, which relocated in 1897 to a new brick building at 20 Garden Street. That building was designed by Edgar Nichols's sister-in- law, Minerva Parker Nichols, and is said to be \\"the first important building by a woman architect.\\"Lois Lilley Howe, The History of Garden Street, Cambridge Historical Society, 1949, page 47 None of these buildings remains today, except for the 11 Appian Way building, relocated around the corner to 3 Garden Street and now serving as an Episcopal Church rectory. In 1911–1913 the school was incorporated and acquired several acres of farmland near Gerry's Landing, a property dedicated as the \\"Nichols Athletic Field,\\" a name by which it is still known. In 1924 the school acquired the contiguous three acres with a gift from Mrs. Kuno Francke in memory of her son Hugo, after whom the field is still named. Francke Field was expanded to its present dimensions through an exchange of property with the Shady Hill School, which by this time had moved to its current location directly next to B&N;'s two athletic fields. A 1928 plan to move B&N; to the Gerry's Landing property foundered in the wake of the Great Depression, but enough money was raised to relocate the Lower School there. Finally, in 1948, a large donation allowed the rest of the school to follow, and the Garden Street campus was sold. Major additions to the new campus's structure followed: a gymnasium and locker room in 1952; the Almy Building in 1956, initially constructed to house grades 7–9; an expansion of the 1928 boathouse in 1959; the Pratt Building in 1960 for the lower school; the Bradford Building in 1962, which included an auditorium and the school's first library; and the enclosed Bright Hockey-Tennis facility in 1966, all of them now part of the Upper School campus. Multiple additional renovations and expansions have occurred over the past 50 years, most notably the Nicholas Athletic Center and Renaissance Hall. The Buckingham School started in a wooden two-story building constructed on the site of a pear orchard at the corner of Buckingham Street and Buckingham Place and opened in 1892. That building, today known as Markham House, still stands. In 1921 the school expanded three additional grades to include college preparation and needing additional space acquired the contiguous property along Parker Street, where it built the large brick building that still occupies the site. In 1924 the school purchased four acres of land on Larch Road, near Fresh Pond, for use in physical education, which continues to serve BB&N;'s athletic program despite the City of Cambridge House Authority's narrowly averted attempt in 1968 to seize the land by eminent domain to build housing for the aged. In 1929 the school acquired another private home known then and ever since as Kelsey House. Just one year after B&N; made its most important expansion, the Buckingham School did the same, with the purchase of a large residence, constructed in 1859, on nearby Sparks Street. This became Buckingham's Upper School. In 1954 it was expanded with a new wing, named after former headmistress Marian Vaillant when the wing was again expanded in 1969. That same year the acquisition of property along Craigie Street provided space for the kindergarten and grades one and two in the newly constructed Morse Building. Merger When Peter K. Gunness, Director of Financial Aid at Harvard, was appointed to succeed Edwin Pratt, who retired after twenty years as B&N;'s headmaster in 1969, Buckingham headmistress Elizabeth Stowe suggested that the two schools should begin exploring cooperative opportunities beyond the joint musical and dramatic ventures that had begun during the Pratt years. For the next two years the schools collaborated on several classes on the two campuses, and the drama clubs formally merged. During the 1971–1972 school year, fifteen classes included students from both schools, and the following year all sixty eleventh and twelfth graders at Buckingham took their classes on the B&N; campus with their male counterparts. Discussions about a formal merger began early in 1973, resulting in the creation of the new coeducational school Buckingham Browne & Nichols, effective January 1, 1974. Elizabeth Stowe's retirement resulted in Peter Gunness's appointment as the first head of the new school. The Gerry's Landing Road campus became BB&N;'s Upper School, the Sparks Street campus the Middle School, and the Buckingham and Craigie Streets campus the Lower School. They have remained in these locations. A fourth campus occupies a former parochial school at 46 Belmont Street in Watertown, where BB&N;'s support staff, including business, human resources, alumni/ae affairs, archives, and other departments are located. In addition, a cooperative day care center, founded by faculty for their children (but also open to others), uses the bottom floor. Bivouac A distinctive feature of BB&N;'s Upper School is the Bivouac program, which B&N; inaugurated in 1951 on privately owned land in Temple, Maine. The program's goals, as expressed from the beginning, are to \\"help students develop a sense of confidence in their own ability to cope with unexpected and challenging situations and to cultivate in the students an awareness of all members of a community.\\" Initially reserved for eighth graders, since 1957 the program has included all ninth graders. In 1975 it moved to school property at the former Camp Marienfeld, in Harrisville, New Hampshire. After the two schools merged, boys and girls participated in separate Bivouacs, until 1980 when they were combined. For eleven days the ninth grade, under the supervision of faculty and eleventh and twelfth grade \\"junior guides,\\" lives outdoors, organized in squads of seven or eight students, and participates in courses, team- and trust-building exercises, and elective activities such as going on an overnight solo. Students entering BB&N; after ninth grade participate in a shortened version of the program. Academic program The Upper School's academic program includes approximately 150 courses offered each year within six departments. The World Language Department offers courses on at least four levels in six different languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. In 2016 seventeen different Advanced Placement courses were offered. Offerings in the Mathematics and Computer Sciences Department run from Algebra I to Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. The History Department includes a global history requirement and multiple elective offerings. Arts program Visual Arts courses include Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, Photography, Art Across Boundaries, Film and Video, Design and Architecture, and Woodworking. Performing Art courses include Chamber Music, Chorale, Drama, a jazz ensemble, and a full orchestra. Athletics program Athletics are offered across all three seasons in 25 different sports, most with varsity and junior varsity teams, and some with a third team. The majority of teams compete in the 16-school Independent School League, of which BB&N; has been a member since the League was founded in 1948. Senior spring project After spring break in March, seniors undertake a Spring Project that they designed during the fall and winter. Most projects consist of some ongoing features, such as AP courses or athletics, along with specially designed classes, internships, community service, and numerous other options. Students may also devote their entire projects to ventures off-campus, sometimes in foreign countries. Travel and exchange opportunities Complementing the Upper School's language program, each of the six language offerings sponsor annual or biennial travel opportunities to China, France, Greece or Italy (Latin), the Middle East (Arabic), Russia, and Spain. The Russian trip, one of several student exchanges, began in 1988 as a way of easing Cold War tensions. In addition, AP Art History makes an annual trip to Italy, and most spring varsity sports make a spring training trip. A special financial aid program enables students who cannot afford these trips to participate. Other trip destinations have included Switzerland and Costa Rica. Student publications BB&N;'s newspaper, The Vanguard BB&N;'s student publications have enjoyed a long history and won many national honors. The official student newspaper, The Vanguard, established at the time of the merger, publishes an issue nearly every month. Its predecessors stretch back to B&N;'s The Spectator, founded in 1906, which evolved into a literary magazine in 1959 and remains such today. The CHASM, (Current Happenings Across STEM) magazine, is the school's STEM-based publication. The Spectator, BB&N;'s art and literary magazine, has been in production ever since its foundation in 1906 by two students of Browne and Nichols. In 2017, the magazine was awarded with a gold medal from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. In 1950 B&N; students published their first annual yearbook, titled The Torch, a reference to B&N;'s school seal designed by renowned sculptor Cyrus E. Dallin. A yearbook has been produced every year since and is now called The Perspective. In 2007, a triannual political magazine was founded known as The Point of View. In addition, a satirical newspaper called The Mouthguard and a television news program called The Knightly News are produced intermittently. For several years Middle School students have also published a newspaper known as The Spark. Athletics BB&N;'s Nicholas Athletic Center from the side. The entrance to the Nicholas Athletic Center.

Nicknamed the \\"Black Prince of Lygon Street\\", Gangitano was the face of an underground organisation known as the Carlton Crew. He was also an associate of alleged organised crime bosses Tom Domican (Sydney) and John Kizon (Perth).John Silvester & Selma Milovanovic. \\"Rogues' gallery emerges from ex-cop's testimony\\". The Age. 5 June 2004. Accessed 9 September 2020. Gangitano is considered to be the second of the thirty Melbourne gangland killings between 1998 and 2010, when he was murdered in 1998. Gangitano was portrayed by Vince Colosimo in the 2008 TV series Underbelly, and by Elan Zavelsky in the 2009 TV series Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities. Early life Gangitano was born on 22 April 1957.Melbourne's underworld grave sites gloss over the brutal pasts of druglords, killers and thugs. Herald Sun. Retrieved 9 September 2020. He attended De La Salle College and Marcellin College. In later years through the 1980s and 1990s, it was later alleged that he was a co-owner of a King Street nightclub and numerous fight promotions and other ventures that went on to include horse racing and protection rackets. At the height of Gangitano's criminal career, he was earning an estimated $125,000–$200,000 a month as a high-profile member of the Carlton Crew. Unlike other criminals, Gangitano purely wanted to be a criminal from a young age. King Street nightclub attack Gangitano, Moran and associate Tony Rapasarda were charged over serious assaults on several patrons at the Sports Bar nightclub in King Street, Melbourne on 19 December 1995. Moran later said of Gangitano: \\"He's a fucking lulu ... if you smash five pool cues and an iron bar over someone's head ... you're a fucking lulu\\". The attack was portrayed on Underbelly. Murder On the day of his death, 16 January 1998, Gangitano was reported to have had a telephone conversation with Kizon. That same day, Graham Kinniburgh drank at the Laurel Hotel in Ascot Vale with associate Lou Cozzo before driving to Gangitano's home in Templestowe. At a subsequent coroner's inquest, evidence was presented that Kinniburgh and Jason Moran were in Gangitano's home that night. Both were exempted from giving evidence at the inquest, on the grounds that their evidence might incriminate them. Kinniburgh left Gangitano's house shortly after 11 pm to purchase cigarettes at a 7-Eleven. Upon his return 30 minutes later, he found that Gangitano had been shot several times in the head in the laundry. Gangitano's de facto wife, Virginia, was with the body. Traces of Kinniburgh's blood were later discovered on the back flyscreen door at Gangitano's home. Kinniburgh reportedly respected the code of silence, frustrating police investigating the murder. Gangitano's pallbearers included suspected underworld figures Mick Gatto and John Kizon. Gangitano is survived by his wife and two daughters, and was widely believed to have had another child with which he had no contact to an unidentified woman. Moran allegedly pulled out a gun after an argument with Alphonse and shot him in the arm and head as he fled towards the laundry. The murder may have led to as many as 75 revenge assaults on underworld members. In 1995, Gangitano was charged with shooting dead petty criminal Gregory John Workman at 1 Wando Grove, St Kilda East; however, Gangitano never went to trial over the shooting after two witnesses retracted their statements. Kinniburgh and Moran themselves were both later murdered.

The Romanesque Revival building was constructed between 1893 and 1898 and is wide by long. The domes were built by Ritchie Brothers, a steel and metal company that also built trains, trams and farm equipment. The building fills a city block bounded by George, Market, York and Druitt Streets. Designed as a marketplace, it was used for a variety of other purposes, underwent remodelling and suffered decay until its restoration and return to its original use in the late twentieth century. The property is owned by the City of Sydney and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010.  History  Wood-engraving of former Sydney Markets (1850) =Site and precursors= The site has been under the control of the Council of the City of Sydney since 1842, when Sydney Town was incorporated. It was previously the location for municipal markets, the first of which, a \\"simple storehouse\\", was put up by Gregory Blaxland. Under Governor Macquarie's leadership, it was subsequently envisaged as a \\"grand civic square\\" by architect Francis Greenway. In the 1830s, \\"four substantial stone halls\\" were built to the design of Ambrose Hallen and later the site was selected for the construction of \\"a marvellous centre of trade\\". =Design= Domes of the QVB and marble sculpture by William Priestly MacIntosh (Perier) The building, on the \\"scale of a cathedral\\" was designed by George McRae, a Scottish architect who had emigrated to Sydney in 1884. At the time, Sydney was undergoing a building boom and since in architecture \\"no one school or style predominated\\", McRae produced four designs for the building in different styles (Gothic, Renaissance, Queen Anne and Romanesque) from which the Council could choose. The Council's choice of Victorian Romanesque style conveys the influences of American architect Henry Hobson Richardson. The use of columns, arches, and a prodigal amount of detail such as was used by McRae in the chosen design are typical of Richardsonian Romanesque, an eclectic style identifiably established between 1877 and 1886. QVB from above showing the disposition of the domes The dominant feature of the building is the central dome which consists of an interior glass dome and a copper-sheathed exterior, topped by a domed cupola. Smaller domes of various sizes are on the rooftop, including ones on each upper corner of the rectangular building. Stained-glass windows, including a cartwheel window depicting the arms of the City of Sydney, allow light into the central area, and the roof itself incorporates arched skylights running lengthways north and south from the central dome. The colonnades, arches, balustrades and cupolas are of typically intricate Victorian style. The site, an entire city block, had previously been occupied by a produce market and the Central Police Court. These uses ceased in 1891 and the land was purchased by Sydney City Council. The Australasian Builder and Contractors' News described the four designs in July 1893 as \\"scholarly Renaissance\\", \\"picturesque Queen Anne\\", \\"classic Gothic\\" and \\"American Romanesque\\". The style chosen was the latter and the foundation stone was laid in December 1893 by the Mayor, Sir William Manning. This foundation stone was a five-tonne block of granite, levered and lowered into position at the corner of George and Druitt Streets. The ceremony was the first of a series in which successive mayors laid stones and plaques to mark the progress of construction. The building was notable for its employment in the expansive barrel-form roof of engineering systems which were very advanced at the time of construction. McRae is considered by architectural historians to have been one of the leading protagonists of the new construction methods and materials which were then beginning to break down the conservatism of building techniques. In achieving the strength and space of the building McRae used steel, iron, concrete, reinforcing, machine-made bricks, glass, imported tiles, fire-proofing, riveting and hydraulics on an unprecedented scale. The huge building was finally completed and opened with great ceremony on Mayor Matthew Harris on 21 July 1898. In a lavish ceremony, Alderman Harris said that the building was intended to be more than a municipal market. With judicious management, he said \\"a marvellous centre of trade will be established here.\\"Sydney Council Council Naming The Queen Victoria Building side entrance from York Street. The Sydney Town Hall is visible at the further end, undergoing maintenance In 1897, the Council resolved to \\"dedicate the new market buildings\\", then still under construction, to Queen Victoria and to name them The Queen Victoria Market Buildings in commemoration of her Diamond Jubilee: The Councillors decided not to ask for the Queen's assent, in part because it would have made it \\"necessary to have the Royal Coat of Arms on the building\\". After the markets originally held in the building were relocated in 1910, the name was amended in 1918 to \\"Queen Victoria Buildings\\". Finally, in 1987, the Council rescinded the 1918 resolution and named it the \\"Queen Victoria Building\\". = Construction = The building was constructed between 1893 and 1898 by the Phippard Brothers (Henry, born 1854 and Edwin, born 1864), \\"the leading building contractors of Sydney\\", whose quarries at Bowral and Waverley supplied the trachyte and sandstone respectively. =Opening= Blank formal invitation card to the ball in celebration of the opening of the Queen Victoria Market Building on Thursday 21 July 1898 The building was officially opened on Thursday 21 July 1898. and provided a business environment for tailors, mercers, hairdressers, florists and coffee shops as well as showrooms and a concert hall. In the evening there was a grand ball for more than a thousand guests held in the adjacent Town Hall. at which the then Lord Mayor of Sydney, Matthew Harris, made a speech that reflected \\"faith in the future, the great theme of the Victorian age of optimism\\", by saying: The Druitt Street entrance was opened by the Lady Mayoress using a commemorative solid gold key on which was a model of the main dome and the smaller cupolas, \\"worth a good deal more than £50\\", made by Fairfax and Roberts and presented by the Phippard Brothers. The building was illuminated by about 1,000 Welsbach incandescent burners, equal in lighting power to about 70,000 candles, producing \\"floods of light\\" that even in the basement was judged to be \\"perfect\\". =Early uses= The building illuminated at night, with George Street to the right A public lending library was planned as early as 1899 and both the City of Sydney Library and the Electricity Department were long-time occupants. Mei Quong Tart's tearoom, Elite Hall, was formally opened by the Mayor of Sydney, Matthew Harris, in 1898. The tea rooms were on the ground floor near the centre of the markets, fronting George Street. A plush-carpeted staircase led to the function hall on the first floor. The Elite Hall had capacity for nearly 500 people and included a stage with an elaborately carved proscenium. At the other end was the Elite Dining Saloon, described as having ‘elegant appointments’. =Subsequent uses= The original concept was for an internal shopping street -long with two levels of shops on either side. In 1917 and 1935 alterations converted the interior to office space with shops to the external street frontages.National Trust of Australia In the first few decades the QVB had the atmosphere of an oriental bazaar, and the earliest tenants conducted a mixture of commerce, crafts and skills. There were shops, studios, offices and workrooms for some two hundred traders, dealers and artisans. Housed within the upper galleries were more studious and scholarly tenancies, such as bookshops, sheet music shops, piano-sellers and piano-tuners, as well as the salons of private teachers of music, dancing, singing, elocution, painting, sculpting, drawing and dressmaking. There were also more decorous sports including a billiards saloon, a gymnasium for ladies and a table tennis hall. The building was heavily criticised in the early years of its operation due to its poor financial return. Original real estate advice indicated the building could pay for itself from rents received, within thirty years. The first few years were slow. In 1898 only 47 out of about 200 available spaces were tenanted. This improved by the following year with another 20 tenants joining the list. By 1905, there were 150 tenants, but it was not until 1917 that the building was reaching its maximum tenancy rate. Up until that time there was a continual shortfall between the costs to Council and the rents received and Council was constantly looking at ways of improving its return. =Early-20th- century alterations= As early as 1902, the City Council was worrying about the building being a \\"non-paying asset and handicap\\". In ensuing years various schemes for selling, remodelling and/or demolition were proposed and reports produced. The markets originally held in the building were relocated to Haymarket in 1910. In 1912 it was described as an \\"incubus\\" and in 1915 and 1916 as a \\"municipal 'white elephant'\\". In 1913 a \\"decision to re-model was arrived at by 10 votes to 9\\" over the options to demolish or sell. Although it had been accepted that nothing could be done until after the war, in 1917 the Council accepted a tender for alterations to the building. A remodelling scheme was finally adopted by Council in May 1917. McLeod Brothers were awarded the contract for the work in June 1917 at a cost of . The following alterations were undertaken: * Removal of posted awning and replacement with a modern cantilevered awning with a lined soffit. * Removal of the internal arcade on the ground floor producing shops running continuously from George to York Street. * The gallery space was extended on the first floor reducing the void space and the remaining void covered over with a coloured leadlight ceiling (indicated on the drawings as lanterns) so that some light was available to the centre of the ground floor shops. * The tiled floor was covered with concrete and timber obliterating the circular pavement lights. * Removal of the entrance from Druitt Street to create one large shop with frontages to three streets. * A new entrance was cut into the York Street side, to provide an entrance to the stairs and lift at the Druitt Street end of the building. * New shopfronts were provided to the George Street facade. This work involved boxing in the trachyte columns behind showcases. The line of the shopfronts was extended out past the line of columns and a new marble and plate glass shopfront installed. Leaded glass panels were installed above the transom line, below the awning. The original coloured glass highlight panels were removed and clear glass panels in steel frames installed. The stall-board lights under the shopfronts were also removed, but some new pavement lights were installed to compensate. * The original timber and glass shopfronts along George Street were re-erected to the shops in York Street providing additional street entrances from York Street, as the market activity in the basement no longer continued. * New bathroom facilities were provided on a new mezzanine level along York Street. * One passenger lift in the southern lift core was cut out and a new stair to the basement level installed. * One lift in the northern stair lobby was cut out and the lift removed. * A new goods lift was inserted near the central entrance on the York Street side. * The void space under the central dome was infilled with a new passenger lift. * Two of the cart lifts to the basement along York Street were removed and the resultant space formed into shops * The galleries on the first and second floors were cantilevered seven feet out into the void space and the shopfronts moved forward seven feet to increase the available floor space in the tenancies. * The first floor void area above the entrance at the Druitt Street entrance was formed into a room by inserting a new floor. * The small passage serving the rooms along the first and second floor, at the Druitt Street end was removed increasing the floor space. * The existing Concert Hall with a height of 42 feet was remodelled with two new floors inserted into the grand space providing three levels to provide space for the city library. These alterations in the name of economy and increased floor space destroyed much of the magnificent interior spaces and character of the building. The ground floor arcade was obliterated, the light quality in the basement reduced, the southern entry devalued and the internal voids and galleries reduced and devalued. The alterations were undertaken to remove what Council saw as, \\"inherent flaws\\", in what its Victorian creators considered, an architectural triumph. One of the disturbing aspects of these radical alterations was that now that the building's internal character had been violated and devalued, there was little resistance to further alterations. The building continued to incur losses and by 1933 the accumulated debt was announced as . No major alterations occurred between 1918 and 1934, but many small alterations to the individual shops such as new partitions, fitouts, and mezzanines were continually taking place. By the mid 1930s the depression was receding, employment growing, building and business reviving. Time had come to rework the building to further reduce the debt and hopefully return a profit. The Council decided to move the rapidly expanding Electricity Department out of the Town Hall and relocate it in the QVB. In December 1933, Council voted to approve a major proposal to alter the Queen Victoria Building to suit the requirements of the Electricity Department. Approval was also given to invite tenders for the work. The majority of the work was confined to the central and northern section of the building. Essentially this scheme was to convert the interior to a general office space and install floors in what remained of the Grand Victorian internal spaces. The work costing (Pounds)125,000 was completed by 1935 and included the following changes: * Shopfronts along George Street were removed and replaced with a new Art Deco facade with \\"stay bright\\" steel mouldings, plate glass windows and black glass facing panels. * To the York Street facade, new plate glass shopfronts were added with terra cotta tiles over the trachyte columns and remaining areas. * A new Art Deco fascia and soffit to the cantilevered awning along George Street. * The passenger lift was removed from the central void under the main dome and the floor infilled to create more floor space and a counter. * Removal of the glass inner dome under the main dome and infilling with a new concrete floor to provide space for a new air conditioning plant. * Removal of both of the grand staircases below the central dome to provide a central vestibule, air conditioning plant and locker rooms. * Infilling of the void to the first floor, northern end, to provide additional floor space. * Installation of a suspended ceiling under the main glass roof and cladding the glass roof with corrugated iron. * The existing ground floor level was altered by inserting a new reinforced concrete floor over the existing with a series of steps to provide a level floor addressing each street level. * Almost all decorative elements, features and mouldings were removed from the interior. * New suspended ceilings and lighting to all other office spaces with ducted air conditioning services supplied. * Removal of some of the spiral staircases. Many of the shops at ground floor level in the southern part of the building were retained although they received new shopfronts in line with the updated Art Deco image. The library in the northern area was retained with no new major alterations. The basement was subject to various alterations such as new concrete stairs, timber framed mezzanines and some new plant equipment, but the long term tenants remained in the basement ensuring little need for alterations. These extensive alterations attracted little public comment at the time. They were accepted within the name of progress as a necessary solution. It is fortunate that the majority of the facade fabric was not altered above the awning line. Perhaps the strength of the architectural image was too strong even for the most practical minded official. An enduring quality the building has always retained is in its ability to change without losing its external imagery and architectural strength as an element in the city. Up until the early 1970s the building became the home of the SCC and much of its identity in the city was based on this use even though the external envelope had not changed. =Decay and debate= Restored stained- glass dome from below Restored stained-glass dome from above Between 1934 and 1938 the areas occupied by the Sydney County Council were remodelled in an Art Deco style. The building steadily deteriorated and in 1959 was again threatened with demolition. Proposals to replace the building which many saw as \\"overdue for demolition\\" included ones for a fountain, a plaza and a car park. The occupancy by the SCC did however provide some security for the building by providing a constant income base. The SCC undertook continual changes to the building, some being significant alterations but the majority were minor such as new partitions, showrooms and fitouts. For example, in the thirty years between 1936 and 1966 a total of 79 separate building applications were lodged with the City Council by the SCC. There is little evidence that any of this work, which was basically related to functional uses and the needs of occupants, proceeded with any concern for the architectural strengths of the building. Proposals for demolition of the building gained strength by the late 1950s in a city eager to modernise and grow rapidly. The post war boom was in full swing and business confidence high. In 1959, Lord Mayor Jensen suggested a scheme demolishing the QVB and replacing it with a public square. Revenue from a badly needed underground carpark would pay for the demolition of the QVB and construction of the square. This scheme gained much support both from the public and the design professions in general. Jensen further suggested an international design competition similar to the competition for the Opera House site and won much support for the idea. Demolition proposals at the time were largely postponed by the continued presence of the SCC in the building. The SCC required another long lease which was granted by the City Council in 1961. The SCC was planning a new large building opposite town hall and required the existing facilities in the QVB to be retained until its completion. The City Council was in no position to refuse the SCC and thus the demolition proposals were temporarily thwarted, although opinion was always behind demolition and a reuse of the site at the time. A form of demolition actually started in 1963 with removal of the cupolas on the roof. Concern about their stability was given as the reason for their removal. The contractor paid for their removal, in fact made a larger profit out of the sale of the salvaged cupolas as souvenirs and garden decorations, than for the contract to remove them. As the new SCC building was nearing completion the question of the QVB's ultimate fate was approaching again. The debates in the late 1950s and early 1960s were largely deflated by the continued occupation of the SCC and other long term tenants, but, as this was not an issue any more, the debate was to enter another stage. By 1967 calls for its preservation were being made by the National Trust of Australia declaring it should be saved because of its historical importance. Calls were also made not only for its preservation but also for its restoration by stripping away the numerous disfigurements, restoring the glass vaulted roof, ground floor arcades, tiled floors, and stone stairs. Many schemes were promoted such as linking the building by tunnels to the Town Hall and other city buildings, schemes involving constructing nightclubs or planetariums under the dome, with shops on the lower levels, art galleries, hotel rooms etc. on the upper levels. Although these plans would have to wait, the Council actually spent considerable funds on renovating the City Library. Demolition was still the favoured option by many in the Council. Even as late as 1969 the Labour Party candidate running for mayor in the City Council elections stated that, if elected he would propose demolition of the QVB, which he said was \\"a firetrap to make way for a new civic square\\". The debate extended from whether or not the building should be demolished to what uses it could be made to serve if preserved and a campaign to preserve it ensued, supported by \\"public meetings, letters to editors, the National Trust and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW) as well as a group called the \\"Friends of the Queen Victoria Building\\".The Newsletter of the group is held in the National Library of Australia. On 31 May 1971, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Alderman Emmet McDermott, leader of the Civic Reform Group, announced the building would be \\"preserved and restored to its original state\\". In 1974, it was classified by the National Trust, which gave it an \\"A\\" classification and defined it as \\"urgently in need of acquisition and preservation\\". There was no suggestion of how that was going to take place, but such a statement became very much the turning point in the buildings history and eventual fate. The building was to be saved, but there was no plan or suggestions about where the funds were to come from. In 1979 the Town Clerk, Leon Carter stated; \\"The Council is determined that the high cost of rebirth of the QVB will not fall on the blistered shoulders of the weary ratepayer\\". Restoration proposals were held up by a combination of lack of funds and continuing disagreements between Council, potential operators and stakeholders such as the National Trust and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. In February 1978, the Hilton Bombing damaged the glass in QVB which led to its replacement in 1979. Finally in 1979 a team was established between Architects Stephenson & Turner and Rice Daubney, Engineers Meinhardt and Partners, Kuttner Collins & Partners for administration, with financial backing by IPOH Garden Berhad. Key conservation groups backed the plan. Negotiations about plans and leases continued for almost three years, but eventually on 1 August 1983 the Lord Mayor and IPOH Garden, signed a ninety-nine year profit-sharing lease. =Late-20th-century restoration= The Queen Victoria Building was restored between 1984 and 1986 by the Malaysian Company, Ipoh Ltd (now owned by the Government Investment Corporation of Singapore), at a cost of $86 million, under the terms of a 99-year lease from the City Council and now contains mostly upmarket boutiques and \\"brand-name\\" shops. During the restoration a car park station was built under York Street. The building's restoration retained its exemplary features including the trachyte stairs, tessellated tiled surfaces and column capitals and created a commercial establishment that houses high end fashion stores, cafés, and restaurants which reflect the original purpose of the building in the city of Sydney. > \\"If there is a lesson for heritage projects from this, it is that heritage > buildings should not only be restored but should be put to a use that will > make them freely accessible to the community at all times ...\\"Yap Lim Sen > (Chairman, Ipoh Ltd Australia) The building reopened at the end of 1986 in time to catch the busy Christmas trading season. The work took almost four years to complete and included a new underground carpark, linking tunnels and a restored interior. As almost nothing of the original interior fabric was left intact the work largely involved reconstructing the details and atmosphere of the place. The completed project can be considered a sound commercial scheme, but not a true reconstruction. A museum approach to conserving the building was recognised by all authorities as being unworkable as the building would be empty and devoid of the life the restoration brief considered essential. =21st-century renovations= By 2006, after successfully trading for twenty years, comprehensive plans were being prepared to conserve the exterior and refurbish the interior of the building to ensure the place was commercially viable as an ongoing retail complex. The major upgrade of the building's interiors were designed by the architectural firm Ancher Mortlock and Woolley in association with interior design firm Freeman Rembel and included installation of: * Contemporary shopfronts, interior signage, a new internal colour scheme, new internal lighting, BCA compliant glass and metal balustrades, new floor finishes, reconstruction of ground floor steel entrance gates and selective bathroom upgrades. * A new vertical escalator system in both the north and south galleries. Between 2008 and 2009, Ipoh performed a $48 million refurbishment adding new colour schemes and shopfronts, glass signage, glazed balustrades and escalators connecting ground, first and second levels. This renovation was described by one architecture critic as an example of Sydney's tendency to \\"start with something wonderful then, with enormous care and expense, wreck it.\\" The recent conservation and refurbishment approach has aimed to clarify the legibility between historic fabric and the new fabric which must be continually updated to ensure the building is viable as an ongoing commercial complex. After its successful refurbishment, the QVB was officially reopened by the Lord Mayor of Sydney Clover Moore on 25 August 2009.Graham Brooks & Associates, 2009.  Description  A landmark grand Victorian retail arcade of three storeys, with sandstone clad walls and copper domes, designed in the Federation Romanesque style, dating from 1893–1898. Apart from the ground floor the facade is basically unaltered, being composite Romanesque and Byzantine style on a grand scale to a large city block. Constructed of brickwork and concrete with steel roof structure and the exterior faced in Sydney freestone. The dominant feature is the great central dome of in diameter and from ground to top of cupola and is sheeted externally in copper, as are the 20 smaller domes. The building consists of basement, ground and two main upper floors with additional levels in the end pavilions. =Interior= The building consists of four main shopping floors. The top three levels have large openings (protected by decorative cast-iron railings) that allow natural light from the ceiling to illuminate the lower floors. Much of the tilework, especially under the central dome, is original, and the remainder is in keeping with the original style. Underground arcades lead south to Town Hall railway station and north to the Myer building. The upper level is especially spacious at the northern and southern ends of the building. The northern end was previously the Grand Ballroom, and is today a tea room.  Displays  Two mechanical clocks, each one featuring dioramas and moving figures from moments in history, can be seen from the adjacent railed walkways. The Royal Clock activates on the hour and displays six scenes of English royalty accompanied by Jeremiah Clarke's trumpet voluntary. The Great Australian Clock, designed and made by Chris Cook, weighs and stands tall. It includes 33 scenes from Australian history, seen from both Aboriginal and European perspectives. An Aboriginal hunter circles the exterior of the clock continuously, representing the never-ending passage of time. The building also contains many memorials and historic displays. Of these, two large glass cases, removed in 2009–10, stood out. The first display case contained an Imperial Chinese Bridal Carriage made entirely of jade and weighing over two tonnes, the only example found outside China. The second was a life-sized figure of Queen Victoria in a replica of her Coronation regalia, and surrounded by replicas of the British Crown Jewels. Her enthroned figure rotated slowly throughout the day, fixing the onlooker with a serene and youthful gaze. On the top level near the dome is displayed a sealed letter to be opened in 2085 by the future Lord Mayor of Sydney and read aloud to the People of Sydney. It was written by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986 and no one else knows what it contains. =Statuary= Two allegorical groups of marble figures above the entrances on York Street and George Street (the two long sides of the building) were designed by William Priestly MacIntosh and selected by a committee made up of the Mayor (Alderman Ives), the Government Architect (Walter Liberty Vernon) and the city Architect (McRae) from designs submitted and displayed in the Sydney Town Hall, among which was one submitted by Australia's first locally-born woman sculptor, Theodora Cowan. MacIntosh's two winning allegorical groups consisted of one centring on a figure of the \\"Genius of the City\\" and the other on the \\"Genius of Civilisation\\", who was said to be modelled on Australian swimmer Percy Cavill. They were described thus: The statuary for the second group was approved in February 1898. Mr McRae was \\"well satisfied\\" with the decision, although he would have preferred them to have been made in bronze. = Bicentennial Plaza = Statue of Queen Victoria in front of the southern (Druitt Street) entrance At the southern end of the building is the Bicentennial Plaza, facing the Sydney Town Hall across Druitt Street. Another statue of Queen Victoria, arrayed on a light grey stone plinth, is the work of Irish sculptor John Hughes. This statue stood outside the legislative assembly of the Republic of Ireland—Dáil Éireann in Leinster House, Dublin—until 1947, when it was put into storage. It was later given to the people of Sydney by the Government of the Republic of Ireland and placed on its present site in 1987. Nearby stands a wishing well featuring a bronze sculpture of Queen Victoria's favourite dog \\"Islay\\", which was sculpted by local Sydney artist Justin Robson. A recorded message voiced by John Laws urges onlookers to give a donation and make a wish. The money cast into this well goes to the benefit of deaf and blind children. = Condition = As at 16 February 2004, the exterior facades above the awning line are largely intact but heavily conserved. For example, the drum of the dome is of rendered concrete painted to resemble stone and the small cupolas adorning the parapet are of fibre glass construction painted to resemble copper. Below the awnings, shopfronts have been interpretively reconstructed. Externally, the building is in good condition. Internally some historic fabric remains. However, due to wide scale destruction in the past the interiors, which were constructed between 1982 and 1986, are largely an interpretive reconstruction as opposed to an accurate reconstruction. While some original features and fabric remains, the 1986 \\"restoration\\" approach intended to recreate the imagery of a grand Victorian style arcade with considerable concessions made to ensure the place was commercially viable as a retail shopping centre. The interior has been modified with the installation of contemporary shopfronts, new interior signage, a new contemporary internal colour scheme, new internal lighting, BCA compliant glass and metal balustrades, new floor finishes, reconstruction of ground floor steel entrance gates and selective bathroom upgrades. The recent conservation and refurbishment approach has aimed to clarify the legibility between historic fabric and new fabric. A new vertical escalator system in both the north and south galleries has also been installed. Internally, the building is in good condition. = Modifications and dates = *1893 Construction commences *1898 Opening of the building *1917 Major internal alterations including enclosing ground floor, reduction in void sizes, alterations to vertical transport systems and major increase in lettable floor spaces *1935 Major internal alterations as building is converted to Local Government office space and facilities with shops to external street frontages, removal of most internal decorative elements including glass domes, Art Deco facade added to George Street *1982–1986 Major conservation and refurbishment of building, returned to use as retail complex *2006–2009 Major internal conservation of facades and internal refurbishment including new colour scheme, new escalators to north and south void, new signage, balustrades, lighting and shopfronts.  Heritage listing  As at 6 October 2009, The Queen Victoria Building is an outstanding example of the grand retail buildings from the Victorian-Federation era in Australia, which has no known equal in Australia in its architectural style, scale, level of detailing and craftsmanship. Saved from demolition in the 1980s, and restored to its original glory, the Queen Victoria Building is an iconic heritage building of Sydney and Australia. Dating from 1898, the Queen Victoria Building represents Australia's largest and grandest Victorian arcade, as well as the largest, most monumental and most intact of the market buildings of Sydney City. The site of the Queen Victoria Building has continued to operate as a market facility for over 190 years, which is a significant historical continuum. The Queen Victoria Building is a superb example of the Federation Romanesque style, also known as the American Romanesque style and a continuation of the Victorian Romanesque style. It represents possibly the largest and finest example of the American Romanesque style to be constructed in Australia, demonstrating the influence of the prominent 19th-century American architect, Henry Hobson Richardson, in Australia during this period. The building expresses an ambitious use of building technology, excellent craftsmanship and decorative detailing. Both the building exteriors and interiors are remarkable and outstanding for their quality, workmanship, materials, richness, imagery and style. The Queen Victoria Building also represents an important building in the professional work of the prominent city architect, George McRae (later, the NSW Government architect) and has an outstanding ability to reflect through its aesthetics and scale, the planning strategies of the city architect for Sydney during the late 19th century. The Queen Victoria Building represents an important shift in heritage consciousness in Sydney during the 1980s because of the public outcry that brought about its conservation and, in particular, the historical restoration approach taken for its refurbishment. It also reflects, through its building development concessions, the importance of heritage conservation in more recent government strategies. At the time of its restoration by the 1980s, few original internal features remained such as some column capitals, trachyte stairs and some tessellated tiles surfaces. The present interiors of the building demonstrate an interpretive reconstruction from the 1980s intended to recreate the imagery of a grand Victorian style arcade with considerable concessions made to ensure the place was commercially viable as an ongoing retail shopping centre. The Queen Victoria Building is a major landmark of Sydney, occupying a full city block, allowing it to be viewed in the round, and forming a major pedestrian link of Sydney City, both at ground level and underground. It makes a significant contribution to the streetscape of the four main streets of the City centre that encircle the building. The building also forms one of the precinct of three key Victorian buildings exemplifying ecclesiastical, government and commercial architecture in Sydney, together with St Andrew's Cathedral and Sydney Town Hall. The Queen Victoria Building and these Victorian buildings have a strong presence as the centre of Sydney City.Graham Brooks and Associates, 2003. Queen Victoria Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Queen Victoria Building is an outstanding example of the grand retail buildings from the Victorian-Federation era in Australia. Constructed in 1893-8 as a grand gesture of Civic pride and Victorian confidence, the Queen Victoria Building is the largest, most monumental and most intact of the Sydney City market buildings, and represents the largest and grandest Victorian arcade in Australia. At the time of its construction, the main dome with a span of was the largest dome in the southern hemisphere. The site of the Queen Victoria Building has continued to operate as a market facility for over 190 years, which is a significant historical continuum. It is an important building in the professional work of the city architect, George McRae, which in association with the Manning Building and City Corporation Building, demonstrates the varied repertoire of the McRae period. This building has outstanding ability to reflect through its aesthetics, the scale of the planning strategies of the city architect during the late 19th century. It is significant as the site of the city library from 1933 to 1987, and of a range of many other uses, including council offices. Saved from demolition in the 1980s and restored to its original glory, the Queen Victoria Building is an iconic heritage building of Sydney and Australia. It is a significant adaptive reuse project for the 1980s, representing an important shift in heritage consciousness of the 1980s towards an \\"historicist\\" approach to refurbishment and an early example of a \\"conservation\\" project without the preparation of a conservation plan. The successful adaptive reuse of the Queen Victoria Building in the 1980s was of major importance to the development of the conservation movement in the city, which resulted in the retention of many important public and private buildings in the city. The site of the QVB also forms part of the elevated areas surrounding and including Hyde Park which was originally a large ceremonial site for Aboriginal people. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Queen Victoria Building site is associated with Governor Macquarie, who dedicated the site for use as a market in 1810. It is also associated with George McRae, the prominent City Architect during the late 19th century, who later became NSW Government Architect from 1912 to 1923. The building has associations with many original early tenants of the market building, including Quong Tart, the prominent 19th-century businessman and philanthropist, and household names such as Lindemans, Penfolds, Singer, and the Young Women's Christian Association. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Queen Victoria Building is a superb example of the American Romanesque style in Australia, which expresses an ambitious use of building technology, excellent craftsmanship and decorative detailing, internally and externally. The building is possibly the largest and finest example of the Romanesque style to be constructed in Australia, demonstrating the influence of the American Architect, Henry Hobson Richardson, in Australia during this period. The Queen Victoria Building is a major landmark of Sydney, occupying a full city block, allowing it to be viewed in the round. It forms an important component of the three major Victorian buildings grouped in the centre of Sydney City including St Andrews Cathedral and Sydney Town Hall. The building is a rare and outstanding example of a grand scale composition for a market building with a highly intact but extensively restored original exterior and reconstructed interior. The design is well resolved both internally and externally, and the building is particularly noted for its use of stone on the facade and colonnade. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The community value for the building is evidenced by the major public outcry in response to its proposed demolition during the 1980s, which played a major role in its conservation at that time. The Queen Victoria Building holds a special place in the community as a major city landmark for its appearance, function, imagery, quality, grand interior spaces, and as a major meeting place and pedestrian link through the City. It is a much loved and well used building. It is significant for its ability to reflect, through its building concessions, the importance of heritage to the government and community at large. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is significant as an early and innovative use of concrete technology. The construction was also innovative as the main dome with a span of was the largest dome in the southern hemisphere at the time and has further significance for its steel construction. The surviving examples of original WC cubicles and urinals represent significant relics and are unique. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is rare in Australia as possibly the largest and finest example of the Romanesque style to be constructed in Australia, and as the largest and grandest Victorian arcade in Australia. Although a number of buildings in Australia exhibit similar characteristics as the Queen Victoria Building, such as the Strand Arcade (built 1890), the Royal Arcade of Melbourne (built 1869), the Freemantle Markets of Western Australia (built 1898), and the Federation Romanesque building of the Societe Generale House of Sydney (built 1894), the Queen Victoria Building is unique in Australia and has no real comparison in the nation as an example of the Federation Romanesque Style, as a market building, or as a retail arcade, in terms of its scale, level of detailing and materiality. It was rare for such a large public building in Australia to be designed and constructed in the Romanesque style, with the smooth faced stonework being an unusual interpretation for the style. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Queen Victoria Building represents an outstanding example of the grand retail buildings of the Victorian- Federation era in Australia, which has no known equal in Australia in its architectural style, scale, level of detailing and materiality. The Queen Victoria Building represents the largest and grandest Victorian arcade in Australia, and the largest, most monumental and most intact of the market buildings of Sydney City.

The conservation of the building largely due to the public outcry against its proposed demolition, and the historical-based restoration approach to the refurbishment of the building in the 1980s represents an important shift in heritage conservation during the late 20th century, which led to the conservation of further buildings in Sydney City.

England and Wales In the courts of England and Wales the term recorder has two distinct meanings. The senior circuit judge of a borough or city is often awarded the title of \\"Honorary Recorder\\". However, \\"Recorder\\" is also used to denote a person who sits as a part-time circuit judge. =Historic office= In England and Wales, originally a recorder was a certain magistrate or judge having criminal and civil jurisdiction within the corporation of a city or borough. Such incorporated bodies were given the right by the Crown to appoint a recorder. He was a person with legal knowledge appointed by the mayor and aldermen of the corporation to 'record' the proceedings of their courts and the customs of the borough or city. Such recordings were regarded as the highest evidence of fact.Riley Munimenta Gildhallæ I. 42-3 Typically, the appointment would be given to a senior and distinguished practitioner at the Bar, and it was, therefore, usually executed part-time only, by a person whose usual practice was as a barrister. It carried a great deal of prestige and power of patronage. The recorder of a borough was often entrusted by the mayor and corporation to nominate its Members of Parliament, as was the case with the Recorder of Barnstaple, who in 1545 nominated the two MPs to represent the Borough of Barnstaple. The only survival today of the historic office is the Recorder of London who is still appointed by the Court of Aldermen of the Corporation of the City of London and thereby becomes a member of that court. He is a senior circuit judge sitting at the Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey). =Titular and honorific recorders= The ancient recorderships of England and Wales now form part of a system of honorary recorderships which are filled by the most senior full-time circuit judges. At each Crown Court centre, a particular judge is appointed \\"resident judge\\", leads the team of judges who sit there and provides the essential link between the judiciary and the administration. In the larger city court centres, the resident judge is usually a senior circuit judge who is recruited and appointed specifically to that post. An exception is the Corporation of the City of London which still follows ancient custom as stated above. In the many smaller towns and cities where the resident judge is not a senior circuit judge, the position is different. The resident judge is deployed specifically to that post by the Lord Chief Justice (with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor) from the ranks of the circuit bench. They then hold office as resident judge for a set period, normally four years, although such appointments are renewable. Whilst the appointment of an honorary recorder has lain with the borough council since the Courts Act 1971, in practice the resident judge is appointed as the honorary recorder. In a borough that is coincident with an ancient assize the position is titular; that is, the resident judge is automatically entitled honorary recorder and continues to hold that title until their retirement from the post. In the case where the resident judge is a fixed-term appointment, it is expected that the city or borough council will appoint them as honorary recorder for the duration of their tenure as resident judge. Boroughs which had a power by charter to appoint a recorder before 1971, but which had no quarter sessions, have a preserved right to appoint anyone, including non-lawyers, as honorary recorder, but an honorary recorder who is not a judge cannot sit as a judge in court or exercise any judicial functions. The procedure to be followed is that laid down by the Lord Chief Justice in his \\"Guidelines for the Appointment of Honorary Recorders\\", which states that it has been the practice of most large city councils to appoint the resident judge to be honorary recorder of the city during his tenure of the office. Some new positions have been created since 1971, for example for the Borough of Redbridge. The appointment of an honorary recorder is made by the borough council concerned, and although it does not require the approval of a higher authority, the Lord Chief Justice has let it be known that he would be pleased if boroughs considering making such an appointment would first consult the Senior Presiding Judge for England and Wales. Due to the reorganisation of courts, especially where local government reorganisation has occurred at the same time, some titles bestowed by one council may be held by the senior resident judge sitting in another borough; a prominent example is the Recorder of the City of Westminster who presides at the Crown Court situated in the London Borough of Southwark. The protocol of the use of the title is that it is customary for an honorary recorder, when sitting in the Crown Court in the city or town where he holds that office, to be described as such in the published court lists. This should not be done, however, when the judge is sitting in the Crown Court in another city or town, whether or not that city or town has an honorary recorder of its own. Eleri Rees, the Recorder of Cardiff (red robes), at a ceremonial event with circuit judges (purple robes) Honorary recorders who are also senior circuit judges are authorised by the Lord Chief Justice to wear red robes when sitting in court. These robes are based on the design of the robes worn by judges of the County Court, but in red and black. They were designed for the recorders of Manchester and Liverpool in 1956. The right to wear them in court was extended in the 1980s to the other senior circuit judges appointed as honorary recorders, but has not been extended to those who are not senior circuit judges. Accordingly, when sitting in court, honorary recorders who are not senior circuit judges continue to wear the normal robes of a circuit judge sitting in the Crown Court. In addition, honorary recorders who are also senior circuit judges are addressed in court as \\"My Lord/Lady\\" (as for a High Court Judge) instead of \\"Your Honour\\" (as for other circuit judges, including senior circuit judges who are not honorary recorders). In the law reports and in court lists an honorary recorder is usually styled \\"The Recorder of X\\". =Recorders as part-time appointments= Since 1971 the term \\"recorder\\" has also been used for a part-time judicial appointment in England and Wales, providing part-time experience of judicial office. The part-time appointees were initially designated \\"Assistant Recorder\\", with a view to promotion to full \\"recorder\\". Appointments are no longer made to the position of Assistant Recorder. Appointments are made by the Crown by Royal Warrant, on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. Since 2006 the Lord Chancellor's recommendations are based upon an independent appointments process by the Judicial Appointments Commission. Eligibility is restricted to barristers or solicitors of at least seven years' standing. A recorder, when acting as such, has all the powers of a circuit judge and may sit in the Crown Court, the County Court or the Family Court. A recorder sitting in the Crown, County or Family Court is addressed as \\"Your Honour\\" (save in the Central Criminal Court (or Old Bailey) where all judges are addressed as \\"My Lord (or Lady)\\"). If appointed to do so under section 9(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, a recorder may sit as a part-time High Court judge. A recorder is paid a daily fee and is expected to sit as a judge for between three and six weeks a year. In other jurisdictions =Ireland and Northern Ireland= The Recorder of Dublin was the principal magistrate for the city of Dublin until the office was abolished in 1924. The judicial offices of Recorder of Belfast and Recorder of Derry still exist. There were also prior to 1924 a Recorder of Cork and Recorders of Limerick, Youghal, Galway, Enniskillen, Carrickfergus, Kinsale, Dundalk, Waterford, Hillsborough, Cashel and Clonmel. =Hong Kong= Hong Kong operates a system of appointing part-time recorders similar to that in England & Wales. The recordership scheme was introduced in Hong Kong in 1994 to encourage experienced practitioners who are willing to sit as a High Court Judge for a few weeks every year, but are not prepared to commit themselves to a permanent, full-time appointment. It was intended to act as a more formal system of appointment compared to the more ad hoc nature of appointment of Deputy High Court Judges.http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr93-94/english/lc_sitg/hansard/h940706.pdf Recorders are practitioners in private practice (in practice, Senior Counsel) who are appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the independent Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission (JORC).Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission Ordinance (Cap. 92) The appointment is for a fixed term of a few years, during which the practitioner sits as a recorder hearing cases in the Court of First Instance of the High Court for a few weeks in a year. Recorders may exercise all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges of a full-time Judge of the Court of First Instance.High Court Ordinance (Cap. 4), Section 6A(3) The qualification for appointment as a recorder is the same as that for High Court Judge: that is, having practised for at least 10 years as a barrister, advocate, solicitor or judicial officer in Hong Kong or another common law jurisdiction.High Court Ordinance (Cap. 4), Section 9 As of 1 April 2020, Recorders receive honoraria at a daily rate of HK$11,765. =United States and Canada= In some U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions, the Recorder's Court is a local court of limited jurisdiction, most often hearing misdemeanors, traffic violations, and other petty criminal offenses. The Recorder of New York City was one of the judges of the Court of General Sessions (the local court of general jurisdiction on criminal cases) and presided over most murder trials in New York City. Historically, the City of Detroit, Michigan had a Recorder's Court, which has now been subsumed as 36th District Court and part of Wayne County Circuit Court. Biblical usage In the biblical kingdom of Israel, the recorder was the chancellor or vizier of the kingdom. He brought all weighty matters under the notice of the king, such as complaints, petitions, and wishes of subjects or foreigners. He also drew up papers for the king's guidance, and prepared drafts of the royal will for the scribes. All treaties came under his oversight; and he had the care of the national archives or records, to which, as royal historiographer, he added the current annals of the kingdom.

This store is famous for its watches, jewellery, chocolate, porcelain, dishware, and handbags, as well as upscale foreign goods. There is an art gallery, called Wako Hall, on the sixth floor. Wako was founded in 1881 by Kintarō Hattori as a watch and jewelry shop called K. Hattori (now Seiko Holdings Corporation) in Ginza. In 1947, the retail division split off as Wako Co., Ltd. From 1894 to 1921, the Hattori Clock Tower stood on the site that Wako occupies today. In 1921, the Hattori Clock Tower was demolished to rebuild a new one. The reconstruction was delayed due to the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1, 1923. The new tower was completed in 1932 as the K. Hattori Building. In homage to its predecessor, the new store was also fitted with a clock. The 1932 building was designed by Jin Watanabe in art deco influenced neoclassical style. Its curved granite façade and clock tower form the central landmark for the district and one of the few buildings in the area left standing after World War II. The building functioned as the Tokyo PX store during the Allied Occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952. The clock tower plays the famous Westminster Chimes. Wako has branches in Haneda Airport, Shinsaibashi, and some luxury hotels in Japan.

Retrieved 16 September 2014. was an Australian organised crime figure from Kew, a suburb of Melbourne. He became a victim of the Melbourne gangland killings, which were dramatised in the drama series Underbelly. Early life Kinniburgh's criminal record consisted of charges of wounding with intent to cause murder, escaping legal custody, dishonesty, racketeering, extortion, bribery, possession of firearms, escape, resisting arrest and assaulting police. Kinniburgh met with members of the Moran family while working on Melbourne's waterside. A former member of the notorious Painters and Dockers, Kinniburgh was considered Melbourne's \\"Mr Big\\" and one of the most influential gangsters in Australia. Death Kinniburgh garnered notoriety for his role in the Melbourne gangland killings. On 13 December 2003, Kinniburgh himself was murdered outside his home in Kew on Belmont Avenue. Two members of a rival criminal gang, or a two-man operation, was suspected of involvement in his death; Carl Williams was questioned, and Andrew Veniamin was treated as a suspect. In 2004, Mick Gatto claimed that Veniamin had implicated himself in Kinniburgh's death prior to himself being killed, but it was later shown that Veniamin had been on the other side of town at the time of the murder. This was deduced by tracking his mobile phone at the time of the murder. However, this in turn has been disputed as a case of the mobile phone and not Veniamin having an alibi. If Veniamin had been one of the two gunmen who killed Kinniburgh, then the identity of the other has never been established. In November 2015, police charged Stephen John Asling with Kinniburgh's murder, who has, subsequently, been committed to trial for the offence. On Saturday, 18 March 2017, Asling was found guilty of Kinniburgh's murder. Alphonse Gangitano murder Kinniburgh was a long-term associate of Alphonse Gangitano. On 16 January 1998, Kinniburgh had been drinking with associate, Lou Cozzo, at the Laurel Hotel in Ascot Vale before driving to the home of Alphonse Gangitano. Kinniburgh left the house shortly after 11 pm to purchase cigarettes from a local store. Upon his return 30 minutes later, Kinniburgh found Gangitano had been shot several times to the head. Gangitano's de facto wife, Virginia, was with the body of her husband who had died in the laundry. Kinniburgh adopted a code of silence, frustrating police investigating the murder. Evidence was presented at an inquest that showed both Kinniburgh and Jason Moran were at the home of Gangitano on the night of his murder. Both were exempted from giving evidence at the inquest on the grounds their evidence may incriminate them. Kinniburgh's blood was discovered at the murder scene and a witness had seen Moran leaving Gangitano's house. In television In the drama series Underbelly he is portrayed by actor Gerard Kennedy and also reprises his role in the 2014 direct sequel Fat Tony & Co..

Notable for his involvement in the Melbourne gangland killings, Moran was shot dead in The Brunswick Club Hotel in Melbourne on 31 March 2004. His murder occurred one week after the funeral of fellow Melbourne underworld criminal and suspected hitman Andrew Veniamin. Moran, married to Judy Moran, was the father of murdered Melbourne underworld figure Jason Moran, murdered in 2003, and stepfather of Mark Moran, murdered in 2000. Moran was a long-term associate of Graham Kinniburgh after meeting as workers on Melbourne's waterside. Kinniburgh was earlier executed outside his Kew home on 13 December 2003. He was also the brother of underworld figure Desmond \\"Tuppence\\" Moran, who was shot dead on 15 June 2009, just outside a cafe on Union Road in Ascot Vale. Murder On 31 March 2004, Lewis Moran and Herbert \\"Bertie\\" Wrout were at The Brunswick Club Hotel, on Sydney Road, Brunswick, which was their regular drinking place. Both men were on bail and did not carry firearms, which would have been a breach of their bail conditions.Underworld figure Bert Wrout recalls the night two gunmen stormed the Brunswick Club to kill Lewis Moran and how he survived Moran was on bail facing serious drug trafficking charges. Two gunmen wearing balaclavas entered the Brunswick Club, at approximately 6:40 p.m. on that day, driving a Ford Falcon EF XR6 station wagon. Moran ran from his place at the bar, over a poker machine, through a glass window before the gunman caught up with him and shot him twice, the fatal bullet being fired into the back of his head from a few centimetres away. Wrout was severely wounded but survived the attack. Keith Faure, his brother Noel Faure and associate Evangelos Goussis were charged on 13 May 2005 with the murder and shooting. Initially they all pleaded not guilty.3 men charged with murder of Lewis Moran On 3 May 2006, Keith Faure pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 19 years for the murders of Moran and Lewis Caine, who was killed two months after Moran. Noel Faure, who was described as a \\"gun for hire\\", was convicted of the murder of Moran and of shooting Herbert Wrout and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 23 years.Noel Faure, hitman paid $150,000 to gun down Lewis Moran, dies in prison at 62 Former Kickboxing champ Goussis, 40, of Geelong was found guilty of Moran's murder on 29 May 2008 in the Victorian Supreme Court. Goussis had stormed into the Brunswick Club and shot Moran as he cowered in a corner. Goussis and two others reportedly accepted a $150,000 contract from Tony Mokbel to kill Moran, the Victorian Supreme Court heard. After five days deliberation, the jury also found Goussis guilty of intentionally causing serious injury to Wrout, but not guilty of his attempted murder. Goussis was also convicted of murdering Caine. In February 2009, Goussis was sentenced to a minimum 30 years in prison for Moran's murder. Lewis Moran was suspected in ordering the death of underworld Hitman Dino Dibra. On 7 May 2007, Carl Williams was convicted of commissioning the murders of four gangland rivals including Jason Moran, Lewis Moran, Mark Mallia and Michael Marshall and for conspiracy to murder a fourth, and sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 35 years. Williams died in Barwon prison, on 19 April 2010, as the result of an attack by a fellow inmate.

She was portrayed by Rachel Gurney. Early life Lady Marjorie was born on 6 May 1860, or according to another episode 12 July 1864, at Southwold, Wiltshire in the home of her wealthy parents, Walter Talbot-Carey, 12th Earl of Southwold and Mabel, the Countess of Southwold. The Earl was a major influence in the Conservative Party. She had one brother, Hugo, Viscount Ashby, who later became 13th Earl of Southwold. As well as this, she had a paternal aunt and uncle and cousin, who succeeded Hugo as Earl of Southwold. Despite parental objections, she ended up marrying the younger son of a country parson, Richard Bellamy in 1880 and they lived rent free in a grand Victorian townhouse which Lady Marjorie's father the Earl of Southwold owned the lease, 165, Eaton Place in London's fashionable Belgravia. They had two children, James (born 1881) and Elizabeth (born 1887). Shortly before their marriage, Richard had become a Conservative MP with the help of her father. Marriage and children Lady Marjorie was portrayed as elegant and having something of the hauteur of women of her age and class but also as basically kind. She maintained social and class distinctions at all times and, unlike her upright husband, is less concerned about absolute moral values than appearances. In the summer of 1906, she had an affair with a much younger man, Charles Victor Hammond, a Captain in the Khyber Rifles and a friend of her son. After the affair had been going on for some time (presumed secret but never was), he asked her to run off with him but she refused as she realised her duty to her family. Her lover was later, by then a Major, killed during a battle in India in 1909. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. In a later episode, a man (Mr.Dooley) who had been Hammond's military batman (personal attendant) showed up with a packet of love letters she had written to him. Rebuffed at the front door of 165 Eaton Place by Mr. Hudson (the butler) as an \\"unwashed Irish vagrant\\", he went around to the mews to make himself agreeable to Thomas the chauffeur. In a sting attempt by the chauffeur, who was given the letters for the purpose of negotiating with Lady Marjorie, monies were extorted from both Bellamys, each unknown to the other, with the convoluted result that ended with Mr. Dooley in jail (on an unrelated charge) and all monies restored to the individuals—with Thomas receiving a gratuity from each of the Bellamys. She was always having trouble with her two children. Elizabeth was a wild child and flirted with socialism, and she married in 1908 a man who failed to consummate their marriage (the story line all but confirms his homosexuality though Lawrence had no problem sleeping with Evelyn Larkin, Elizabeth's bohemian/radical friend), and she had an affair with his publisher at the behest of her husband. As a result, Elizabeth became pregnant and delivered a daughter, Lucy Elizabeth, her marriage was ended, and her husband dispatched to the continent \\"with a modest pension\\" from the Bellamys \\"to keep him happy\\" (and quiet) about the sordid affair. In 1908, James, who was always her favourite, had an affair with the housemaid Sarah and she ended up expecting. James was sent to India. Sarah was shipped off to Southwold, but returned to Eaton Place in May 1909 on her own and unhappy, saying \\"No one said anything to me one day to the next!\\" Sarah was in labour while the King was dining upstairs, and the baby boy was still-born. Death On 15 April 1912 Lady Marjorie and her lady's maid, Miss Roberts, along with Lady Marjorie's brother the new Lord Southwold and his new wife (a widow, Marion Worsely, mother of Georgina by her previous marriage) were passengers on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. They were both presumed dead, but Roberts survived and later informed the family that Lady Marjorie had at first refused to go out on deck as it was too cold. When ordered to by the ship's crew, Lady Marjorie and Roberts found on deck a little girl crying she had lost her mother. Lady Marjorie pressed her jewel case into Roberts' hands, her last words being \\"Keep this safe for me, Roberts.\\"; she then took the little girl's hand, saying she would help her find her mother. This was the last time Roberts saw her Ladyship. Roberts was forcibly placed into a lifeboat before Lady Marjorie returned, and even though there was hardly anyone aboard the lifeboat the crew refused to return to the ship for fear of being sucked down as the Titanic sank. The next day Roberts was rescued along with the other survivors, but was in a state of shock so no one knew her identity, with the result that both were listed as dead. Later when she returned to her senses in a New York City hospital she realised who she was and subsequently made her way back to London. Accuracy of dates The episode \\"A Family Gathering\\" has the Bellamys celebrating Lady Marjorie's birthday on the same day as The King died, 6 May. In the episode \\"Desirous of Change\\", her birthday is, however, said to be 12 July. However the 12 July date is from a book and most likely a typical error common in most books about families. Since the Bellamys celebrate the 6 May onscreen it is more likely to be her birthday. James in novelisations is said to be 23 in 1904 at his entrance in \\"Board Wages\\". In 1912 when he first met Hazel, Lady Prudence remarks to Richard that James is 30 now and that his other friends are married. Actually in 1912 James would have been 31 but he may have not had a birthday yet or Lady Prudence felt herself accurate enough to round off his age to 30. However, as a lifelong friend of Lady Marjorie she should have known James' exact age. Elizabeth's birth of 1887 is more consistent in the series. She comes back from schooling in Germany as a 17-year-old in 1905 (she possibly has a late year birthday). Later when Elizabeth becomes involved with Julius Karekin, Richard is heard to say that \\"...Elizabeth is 23 now!\\" which would have been late 1909 or early 1910. Once again Richard should have known the exact age of his own daughter.

During his tenure with that magazine, he became a leading figure within the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa). During the 1970s he headed the United Nations Observer Mission of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) in New York City and used this position to popularize the PAC particularly among African-Americans. In 1979 Sibeko was partially successful in a leadership coup against Potlako Leballo. However he failed to get support from the Second Azanian People's Liberation Army, recruited from the 1976 student protest generation and was shot dead during an argument with them at his flat in Oyster Bay, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on 12 June 1979. David Sibeko's contribution to the liberation struggle in South Africa unfortunately is little known. In actuality his influence was pervasive and, some would argue, on par with that of Nelson Mandela. Sibeko adroitly used his position as the head of the PAC Observer Mission at the United Nations as a way to unite diverse sectors of the international black community behind the PAC. Thus he counted among his personal friends and supporters personages as varied as Andrew Young, Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture), Julius Nyerere, Louis Farrakhan, and the heads of state of countries such as Haiti (pre-Aristide), to Libya, Egypt, the future Zimbabwe, Ghana, Guinea, and many more that comprised the Organization of African Unity. A sharp thinker, and, above all, an eminently practical, big-hearted man with an easy laugh, he could be seen coaxing support from a U.S. State Department official one minute, gathering support from the communist Chinese the next, and persuading the Soviet representatives to assist the PAC in some small matter or another after that. One could easily find the same ANC officials that would detract him and the PAC during the day, drinking, eating (he would personally cook for his guests), and laughing at his apartment on West End Avenue in New York City that same evening. Had he remained as a highly effective diplomat as a counterbalance to the revolutionary activities of the younger generation the PAC would have continued as a serious rival to the ANC.

The story of the Aethiopis comes chronologically immediately after that of the Homeric Iliad, and is followed by that of the Little Iliad. The Aethiopis was sometimes attributed by ancient writers to Arctinus of Miletus (8th century BC) (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised five books of verse in dactylic hexameter. Date The Aethiopis was probably composed in the seventh century BC, but there is much uncertainty about its date. Ancient sources date Arctinus to the eighth century; but the earliest artistic representations of one of the most important characters, Penthesilea, date to about 600 BC, suggesting a much later date. Content In current critical editions only five lines survive of the Aethiopis' original text. We are almost entirely dependent on a summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the Chrestomathy attributed to an unknown Proclus (possibly to be identified with the 2nd- century AD grammarian Eutychius Proclus). Fewer than ten other references give indications of the poem's storyline. The poem opens shortly after the death of the Trojan hero Hector, with the arrival of the Amazon warrior Penthesileia who has come to support the Trojans. She has a moment of glory in battle, but Achilles kills her. The Greek warrior Thersites later taunts Achilles, claiming that he had been in love with her, and Achilles kills him too. Achilles is ritually purified for the murder of Thersites. Next another Trojan ally arrives, Memnon, son of Eos and Tithonus, leading an Ethiopian contingent and wearing armour made by the god Hephaestus. In battle, Memnon kills Antilochus, a Greek warrior who was the son of Nestor and a great favourite of Achilles. Achilles then kills Memnon, and Zeus makes Memnon immortal at Eos' request. But in his rage Achilles pursues the Trojans into the very gates of Troy, and at the Scaean Gates he is killed by an arrow shot by Paris, assisted by the god Apollo. Achilles' body is rescued by Ajax and Odysseus. The Greeks hold a funeral for Antilochus. Achilles's mother, the sea nymph Thetis, comes with her sisters and the Muses to lament over Achilles's body. Funeral games are held in honour of Achilles, at which his armor and weapons are offered as a prize for the greatest hero. A dispute over them develops between Ajax and Odysseus. There the Aethiopis ends; it is uncertain whether the judgment of Achilles' armor, and subsequent suicide of Ajax, were told in the Aethiopis, in the next epic in the Cycle, the Little Iliad, or in both. Importance of the poem Events told in the story of the Aethiopis were popular among ancient Greek vase painters. Especially popular scenes are the death of Penthesilea, and Ajax's retrieval of Achilles' corpse. Despite being poorly attested, the Aethiopis is frequently cited in modern scholarship on the Homeric Iliad.See e.g. G. Schoeck 1961, Ilias und Aithiopis: kyklische Motive in homerischer Brechung (Zurich); J. Burgess 1997, \\"Beyond Neo-analysis: problems with the vengeance theory\\", American Journal of Philology 118.1: 1-17; M.L. West 2003, \\"Iliad and Aithiopis\\", Classical Quarterly 53.1: 1-14. It is one of the most important paradigms used in Neoanalytic scholarship on Homer because of strong similarities between its story of Achilles, Antilochus, and Memnon, and the Iliadic story of Achilles, Patroclus, and Hector; the claim that such a similarity exists is known as the \\"Memnon theory\\".See especially W. Schadewaldt 1965, Von Homers Welt und Werk (4th ed.; orig. publ. 1944; Stuttgart). Editions * Online editions (English translation): ** Fragments of the Aethiopis translated by H.G.

It has both expensive and large detached properties as well as more modest town houses built in a variety of architectural styles. The area is popular with expatriates working in the emirate and is familiar to many tourists visiting Dubai.  History  Majlis Ghorfat Umm Al-Sheif (; ), named in honor of one of the ancient submarines which was full of oysters, is a preserved building that was a home of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, where he used to spend afternoons during summer. Constructed in 1955, it is considered to be one of the most important historical places in Jumeirah. It is now owned and managed by Dubai Culture & Arts Authority. Archaeological excavations at Jumeirah Archaeological Site, which was discovered in 1969, demonstrate that the area was inhabited as far back as the Abbasid era, approximately in the 10th century CE. At this time, it appears to have been the coastal part of an Eastern Arabian subregion referred to as 'Tawam', which comprises the city of Al Ain in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and the adjacent Omani town of Al-Buraimi. Measuring about , the site lay along a caravan route linking India and China to Oman and Iraq. Historically, Emirati people living in Jumeirah were fishermen, pearl divers and traders. At the turn of the 20th century, it was a village of some 45 areesh (palm leaf) huts, inhabited mainly by settled Bedouin of the Bani Yas and Manasir tribes. At the time, Jumeirah was 'about 3 miles southwest of Dibai town'. In modern times (1960 onwards), Jumeirah was the principal area for western expatriate residences. The beachfront area was previously called \\"Chicago Beach\\",Krane, Jim City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism, page 103, St. Martin's Press (September 15, 2009) as the site of the former Chicago Beach Hotel. The locale's peculiar name had its origins in the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company which at one time welded giant floating oil storage tankers called 'Kazzans' on the site. The old name persisted for a time after the old hotel was demolished in 1997. \\"Dubai Chicago Beach Hotel\\" was the Public Project Name for the construction phase of the Burj Al Arab Hotel until Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the new name - Burj Al Arab.

According to the , it has a population of people. Geography The municipality has a total land area of , representing about 11.59 percent of the total land area of the province. =Barangays= At present, Basud is composed of 29 barangays after the poblacion was divided into two on June 6, 1988, through the initiative of late Municipal Councilor Modesto A. Zepeda during the incumbency of then Mayor Silverio F. Quiñones Jr. Population shown from 2010 census. =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Basud, Camarines Norte, was people, with a density of . The municipal population is unevenly distributed over its 29 barangays and varies in terms of population sizes and growth rates. The barangays along the national road recorded the highest population share. In 2007 San Felipe recorded a population share of 8.63%, Barangay Poblacion 1 and Matnog followed with 8.02% and 7.79%, respectively. Binatagan has the least population with 295 or 0.80% of the total population. Economy =Agriculture= The municipality's lands, which are devoted to agriculture, have an approximate area of 12,086.60 hectares or 47.38% percent of the municipality's total land area. The municipality is producing three major agricultural crops. Coconut land occupies the largest area that has 10,324 hectares. Rice land, which has the second largest area with 627.10 hectares irrigated and 254 hectares rainfed. The third is 586 hectares planted to pineapple. Other crops are seasonal crops and are being for family consumption only. Crops Copra is known to be the chief product and the main source of income of the municipality. Coconut by-products such as brooms, baskets, charcoal and even soap making are the traditional sources of income of the people. The second major product of the municipality is palay, which is harvested twice a year in irrigated areas of 627.10 hectares, which has an average yield of 80 cavans per cropping of 74.24 MT per year. Rainfed areas are being harvested once a year with 60 cavans per hectare per cropping or 17.04 MT per year and even lesser in times of calamities and drought. Pineapple, which lately bloomed in production due to the government assistance on crop loan, has made farmers to plant most of the coco-based areas. It occupies an area of 586 hectares. Pineapple production is usually 18 to 20 months before it can be harvested. Livestock/Poultry The present livestock production is primarily on small-scale basis with mostly backyard farming except those who produce broilers, which range from 100 to 300 birds. Poultry such as native chicken are usually few in numbers per farmer and subsist on stray grain and grasses. Pest and diseases often attack the birds, thus dwindle the stock and produces low quality chickens. Hogs are also a backyard activity. There are usually 1 to 2 stocks per farmer. The housing is built of light local materials. Breeding and inter-breeding with poor quality species results to a smaller and slower hog variety. Farmers cannot afford to have high quality breed because of high capital including the high cost of feeds and the risk in raising this kind of variety, thus diminishing the margin of profit. =Fisheries= The municipality has two coastal barangays namely: Taba-taba and Mangcamagong situated along the coast of San Miguel Bay. Most of the fishermen here are sustenance fishermen with limited fishing paraphernalia and few own fishing boats of three tons gross and less. Fish caught in this area are customarily brought and hauled in Mercedes since most of these fishermen have consignment deals with fish dealers. Few are sold in Basud town proper through rigaton. The necessity to improve the road and market facilities will possibly change the trend of fish marketing here in Basud. Likewise, fishermen themselves could directly market their catch to Manila and command a higher price without so much cost on fuel. =Commerce= The municipality of Basud significantly improved for the last ten years in terms of commerce. The municipal officials focused their attention at the municipality public market as the center of commerce. It was established in 1990 seven fresh fish stalls, meat stalls, vegetables stalls, dried fish stalls, sari-sari stores, agricultural stall, hardware, drugstore, bakery and dry good stall. Study reveals that occupants vacated their stalls due to poor or lack of patronage on the part of the people and an insufficient capital on the part of the stallholders. =Other industries= ;Diatomaeous Earth (White Clay) The municipality is rich in mineral resources such as diatomaceous earth (DE) or commonly called white clay. This is one of the income generating industries of the municipality. This non-metallic mineral can be found in barangays Caayunan, San Pascual, Oliva and San Felipe. It has a total approximate reserve of 1,289,600 metric tons. ;Gravel and sand The municipality has a viable source of sand and gravel. The Bactas River located in Pagsangahan and Oliva is a source of mixed gravel and coarse aggregate. It is being extracted by mining concessionaries. Matnog is another source of construction aggregates including sand that is being extracted by the barangay people. Infrastructure ;Transportation Land transportation is the primary means of transporting people, goods and services from the barangay to the town proper of Basud. While sea transport is being used by the municipality's two coastal barangays, namely: Taba-taba and Mangcamagong, they often use during summer as an alternative route to the fishing town of Mercedes. ;Roads The municipal proper is being linked to its different barangays by the municipality's two major roads, namely the Maharlika Highway and the Mangcamagong provincial road. The Maharlika highway has a total length of 25.50 kilometers stretching from the boundary of the municipality of Daet to the Camarines Norte - Camarines Sur boundary. The Mangcamagong provincial road has a total length of 9.46 kilometers, stretching from the municipal boundary of Basud and Mercedes to the junction of Maharlika highway. The municipality has a total road network of 138.057 kilometers composed of 25.50 kilometers of national highway and 23.16 kilometers of provincial roads including 83.481 kilometers of barangay roads and 5.956 kilometers of municipal streets. ;Fish landing Basud has fish ports serving the two coastal barangays of Mangcamagong and Taba-taba. To this date, said fish port that the government spent more than one million pesos cannot fully serve for its main purpose, first, due to its almost dilapidated structure and secondly, there is no big fishing vessels using the port. ;Water supply The different barangays of the municipality is being served by levels I, II and III water supply. As of 2001, serving with potable water is 4,110 households. CNWD was serving 2,558 households mostly in barangays Poblacion I, Poblacion II and part of barangays Matnog, Bactas and Mocong. The municipality's water consumers are consuming an average of 07.4 cubic meters per day. To cope with the consumption demand especially during summer, the CNWD has constructed an elevated water tank with a capacity of 200 cubic meters and implementing the “Tubig ng Buhay, Hatid sa Barangay” program. Barangays San Pascual, Caayunan, Tuaca and San Felipe are being served by spring development. Other barangays are being served by shallow wells, deep wells or dug wells. ;Power supply Basud has been served by electric power, formerly by the defunct Hidalgo Electric Enterprise, now by the National Power Corporation through the Camarines Norte Electric Cooperative (CANORECO). After the establishment of this cooperative, there was a great improvement in terms of power supply condition in the municipality. ;Communication Basud has a telecommunication system that is being run by one personnel of the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC). There are two satellites of Smart and Globe in Poblacion II. There is postal office and has a staff of one mail carriers serving all barangays in the municipality. These personnel cannot adequately serve the entire from the lack of personnel; another problem is the difficulty in the delivery of mails in the remote and far-flung barangays. Education The municipality has 26 elementary schools, two National High Schools and 31 Day Care Centers. Barangay Caayunan has two elementary schools while barangays Mantugawe, Binatagan and Manmuntay have none. There are four High School namely: Basud National High School at Poblacion Uno and Amoguis, San Felipe National High School at Barangay San Felipe, Tuaca National High at Barangay Tuaca and Dominador Narido High School at Barangay Taisan. Tourist attractions Bicol Nature Park There are five major tourist attractions in the municipality, this are; * The Taba-taba white sand beach. This beach is situated at the shoreline of barangay Taba-taba and is accessible by barangay road from the junction of the Mangcamagong provincial road. The beach is part of San Miguel Bay and is very shallow with gradual depth of 4 to 7 feet during high tide. The seawater is so clean and calm and is famous of its white glittering sand with an approximately 40 meter distance of shoreline, which extends along the sea coast of the barangay proper. *The Mangcamagong beach has almost the same feature as that of Taba-taba. The only difference is that Mangcamagong beach has a longer shoreline than Taba-taba. * The Bicol Natural Park is located within the territorial jurisdiction of barangay Tuaca. It has a distance of 18 kilometers from the town proper. It has a forest reserve land area of 3,34 hectares. At the heart of this forest is the famous 7- kilometer winding road called Bitukang Manok. Motorists in all walks of life, while passing this forest zone feel the cool breeze and moderate winds. It lies between the Province of Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte. The boundary is very much identified because of its famous Bahi River passing a permanent boundary marker. * Within the Bicol Natural Park is the \\"Mother Tree\\", considered the largest and oldest tree in the Bicol Region. It is a centuries- old Talisay tree found some four kilometers from the national road. * Laniton Shrine, located along the national road, near the Laniton Bridge. This place is where the first armed conflict between marching [Japanese Imperial Forces] from south and the combined guerilla and USAFFE forces defending provincial capital Daet. The guerilla forces were led by provincial hero Wenceslao Vinzons. Today, the site is marked by a historical and peace shrine, recognized with a historical marker by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. * There are seven waterfalls in barangay San Pascual, Basud, Camarines Norte. According to barangay Captain Jess Saloma it is known as the Reyna Zafari heroes. The trail is not difficult and after more or less two hours depending on the pacing of the group, the falls can be reached. The road that leads to the barangay is well paved and is accessible by public transportation. The photo of reyna zafari heroes falls was taken by Kagawad Ferdinand Pla of barangay uno, Daet, Camarines Norte. * The twin falls of barangay San Felipe is one of the most accessible waterfalls in the province of Camarines Norte. Nature lovers will be able to experience the twin falls after a fifteen minutes trek. The photo of the twin falls was taken by Jolly Walker.

According to the , it has a population of people. Barangays Capalonga is politically subdivided into 22 barangays. In 1955, the sitio of Ilayang Basiad was converted into the barrio of San Pedro. History Agtas and Dumagats, are believed to be the first inhabitants of village used to be called \\"Apalong\\". This name was derived from a wild plant called \\"Palong Manok\\", which looks like a rooster's comb. It is said that whenever the settlers of Apalong went to other places and asked where they came from, the usual reply is \\"We came from Kapalungan\\". Historians may comment that the natives were either referring to their place which has many \\"Palong\\" (roster's comb) or maybe they wanted identification for their settlement. Whatever it was, no record will show and no one at that time is still living, what is clearly known to Capalongueños is that this place was and still is an environment of flowers called Palong Manok. In 1572, the Spanish Conquistador Capt Juan de Salcedo and his men reached pacific shores and landed on Kapalongan settlement. Instead of finding gold, they found abundant wild beautiful red flowers that looked like roster's comb. The Spaniards built a church, formed a government, and the village was made a town and officially named Capalonga. The Spaniards for some years persisted on mining for gold at Sitio Maglagonlong, and the Spanish control was described to be brutal, harsh and full of harassment until they went away leaving behind imprints on the community's cultural heritage. It is also believed that the first migrants of Capalonga came from the neighboring province of Tayabas. This is the reason that out of the twelve (12) municipalities of Camarines Norte, Capalonga has the highest rating and accent in speaking the Tagalog language. However, with the continuous migration process, mixed dialects has been produced. Today, like other places in the country, the dialects of the residents were enriched by various local medium of expression, thereby making no difference from the trend of other political units. Without roads and being isolated from other towns by mountains, forest, rivers and sea, Capalonga remained relatively undeveloped by commerce and industry as late as the 1950s. In 1956, the road to Capalonga was opened. Still, growth had been slow until Martial law changed the pace. It was in the years 1987 to 1992 that all wooden and temporary bridges have been replaced by concrete bridges. Likewise, in the late part of 2003 up to the present, the paving of the Bagong Silang - Capalonga Road has started and existence of the air-conditioned van transport is now available as a result.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality is a popular surfing spot among surfers worldwide. It is also home to the annual Daet International Aerosports Show, first held in 2013. Etymology The name Daet was derived from the Bikol word dai-daitan which means, close to each other. Daet also originated from ancient Bicol term daet which, according to the first Bicol Spanish Dictionary Vocabulario de la Lengua Bicol authored by Fray Marcos de Lisboa, would mean \\"to make friend\\" or \\"to be reconciled\\". History =Pre Colonial= Daet was already an old community even before the discovery of the Philippines by Magellan in 1521. An ancient tomb unearthed in the Bicol region revealed references described in the Panayam manuscripts known to oriental history as corresponding to the first half of the thirteenth century. The early settlers were believed to be direct descendants of the group of datus who escaped from the court of Brunei (Borneo) to evade the enmity of a ruling rajah . =Spanish Colonial Era= In 1571, Juan de Salcedo arrived at the Bicol Region in quest for gold found in Camarines Norte and discovered that Daet was already a thriving settlement and noted that the houses were clustered together for reason of safety and protection. In June 1583, through a Franciscan Order confirmed the founding of Doctrinas including Daet. Long after the implantation of the Spanish sovereignty, Don Juan de Salcedo, “talented, dashing grandson of Legazpi ” found this community in the course of an expedition in search of gold which the Camarines mountains were heart to abound, marking the beginning of over a three-century Spanish regime patterned after the sword and the cross. In the meantime, an incident happened in the court of Spain over the romances of a woman which pressed the King to exile a Spanish noble to the Philippines who eventually chose to come this way to spend the rest of his life, forget all, and start life anew. This noble was Don Manuel de la Estrada, Marquis de Camarines , who devoted a lifetime to help implement the Spanish colonization blueprint in the building of a new town over our old community. He supervised the construction of the church as it stands today, the old Spanish to exile a Spanish noble to the Philippines who eventually bridge (now covered by a Bailey bridge ), other stone bridges buildings. He also brought the first abaca seedlings and encouraged its cultivation which has given the Philippines the world monopoly of hemp fiber. Incidentally, from the union of this noble to a Filipino woman followed a long line of blood relation which still link most of the old families of this community. The ruins of the palatial mansion of the Marquis de Camarines were still visible in recent years, on the spot where the new building of the Provincial Capitol now stands. Except for recurring raids by the Moro pirates who occasionally came on their fast frail vintas to pillage this community causing the fortification of barrio Mercedes (now an independent municipality since 1948) during the Spanish regime, this community lived progressively in blissful peace and contentment. Formerly, the whole of the present Province of Camarines Norte was known as the District of Daet and this capital was a “Comandancia” of the original province of Camarines during the Spanish regime. In the few times that the Province of Camarines Norte was separated from and again fused with Camarines Sur from the Spanish to the American regimes, Daet always retained her importance as the provincial capital. In the ensuing changes, this municipality lost further much of her territory which was restored to Camarines Sur, and due to the segregation of the Municipality of Basud which was a former barrio of this community in the year 1908. No less than thirteen martyrs were contributed by this community before the altar of liberty. They were butchered or burned alive and buried in a common grave during the Holy Week on Easter Sunday, April 1898. The local “insurrectus ”, however, made a remarkable feat in the last days of the Spanish regime when they succeeded in containing the Spanish local garrison and subjected them under relentless attack. The Spaniards were dramatically saved from annihilation by burning at the timely arrival of their rescue ship. Daet today takes a distinct pride for owning the first monument ever erected in the Philippines in honor of the foremost Filipino hero and martyr, Dr. Jose P. Rizal Protacio y Mercado , at the inspiration of Don Antonio Sans, Commanding Officer of the Philippine Revolutionary Forces in the sector. =American Colonial Period= The Philippine–American War was felt very little in this town. The American forces came unopposed on March 4, 1900 when almost the rest of the Bicol Region was subdued by Major McNamee under the overall command of General Bates before whom Commander Antonio Sans previously arranged in Camarines Sur the terms of surrender which were acceptable to the American Command. The strides undergone by this community under the American regime is yet to be written in bold letters of gold, a period which brought about the present day progress of this generation. = Martial law = On the evening of September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos announced on television that he had placed the Philippienes, including Daet, under martial law. The marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one-man rule. Even though Martial Law was formally lifted on January 17, 1981, Marcos retained essentially all of his powers as dictator until he was deposed by the February 1986 People Power revolution. On June 14, 1982 Marcos administration forces opened fire on protesters from different barrios, who were marching to demand an increase in copra prices, and to denounce \\"fake elections\\" and Cocofed. The government forces who fired on the protesters were led by a certain Capt. Malilay.\\"Bantayog.org website - Martyrs of the 1981 Daet Massacre Four people died on the spot, and at least 50 were injured. Two of those who were seriously wounded died two months later. This has come to be known as the \\"1981 Daet massacre,\\" and four of those killed have since been honored by having their names engraved on the Wall of Remembrance at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani memorial. =Conversion to cityhood= A P30-million government center, a P30-million transport terminal and an improved airport are among the large- scale face-lift projects that Camarines Norte's capital town plans to embark on as it aggressively vies for cityhood. The projects, including a new face of the town plaza, were presented by Mayor Tito Sarion in an executive report last month. \\"The enhancement of the elevated plaza is necessary to decongest the downtown in an attempt to rebuild the center of the commercial district,\\" he said. Sarion said the United Architects of the Philippines had agreed to design the new plaza through a P3-million grant provided by the party-list group Bayan Muna. The funds for the government center and transport facility will be borrowed from the Land Bank of the Philippines, while the revitalized Bagasbas airport project will be funded by the Air Transportation Office (ATO). Sarion said the proposed government center would make transactions with provincial and national government agencies more convenient while the new legislative hall would \\"create a breathing space and a better working environment at the municipal hall, where offices are crowded.\\" Geography =Barangays= Daet is politically subdivided into 25 barangays. * Alawihao * Awitan * Bagasbas * Barangay I (Ilaod) * Brgy II (Pasig) * Brgy III (Iraya) * Brgy IV (Mantagbac) * Brgy V (Pandan) * Brgy VI (Centro) * Brgy VII (Diego Liñan) * Brgy VIII (Salcedo) * Bibirao * Borabod * Calasgasan * Camambugan * Cobangbang * Dogongan * Gahonon * Gubat (3 Districts – Moreno, Gubat, & Mandulongan) * Lag-on * Magang * Mambalite * Pamorangon * Mancruz * San Isidro =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Daet, Camarines Norte, was people, with a density of .

It was the Spaniards, drawn by the rumor of immense gold deposits in the Mambulao- Paracale district, who mastered in exploring the gold mining potentials of these towns. From the 1750s to 1800s, Paracale held the major Spanish mines, but due to its closure in the 1790s, its people were living in desultory gold washing, fishing and selling betel nut to Mambulao which has now become the mining center. During that time, there were plenty of small shops but there's no rice fields and vegetable gardening. All necessities came from Ambos Camarines and Tayabas (Quezon). Fifteen years later, the mines of Mambulao were no longer open. There was still some haphazard gold washing by women of Indio Class whose husbands, it was alleged, gambled away their meager earning in card games run by the town mayor. But by 1818, the population was back to the levels of the 1790s and by the mid-1820s annual gold production levels ran as 3,200 ounces (90.7 kg.) worth Php. 44,000 at prevailing prices. By 1829, Camarines Norte was considered to be wealthy and populous enough to warrant separation as province of its own for the first time. But after the 1840s the mining and population declined. Dr. Fedor Jagor (in his book Travels in the Philippines and The former Philippines thru Foreign Eyes), a well known German traveler who visited Mambulao in 1859, reported that it was thinly populated and that the mining mania was already ruined.\\"Travels in the Philippines\\" (English) Reisen in den Philippinen. Chapman and Hall, London 1875 From 1837 to 1876 the population of Mambulao and Paracale decreased by 30%. From 1900 until the early twenties, Mambulao was a sleepy town, isolated from the other towns of Camarines Norte. During the gold bloom, it was dubbed as “Little Manila”, due to flourishing business operated by Filipinos, Chinese, Japanese, Syrians and many others. Dutch-born Filipino citizen Jan Hendrik Marsman operated two rich mines during the American occupation, a substantial dredging operation and the Philippines only smelter located in the Mambulao- Paracale district. The population quadrupled between 1918 and 1938. One of the most notable mining company to operate in this municipality is the Philippine Iron Mines, then the largest iron mine in Asia.

However, the mission was abandoned in 1634, reestablished by the Franciscans in 1638 but was abandoned again in 1662. In 1687, the Franciscan missionaries returned to their mission. It was later ceded to the secular clergy. In 1863, Paracale was then formally established as a town. Seventeen years later, the Franciscans returned to Paracale to take charge the spiritual administration of the faithful. A large gold mine was discovered here in 1626 and Spaniards worked the gold-bearing gravel in its rivers and streams. The Americans set up huge dredges and mined primary lode deposits. The town’s name was derived from para cale, meaning “canal digger.” Small gold mining operations persist in this old gold mining center and locals still pan for gold.

San Lorenzo Ruiz is aiming to become an Eco- Adventure town and the zipline is the start of their plans to add more facilities in the area to increase adventure sports like rappelling, water tubing, trekking, all terrain vehicle ride and many more. Canyoning and River Trekking The mampurog river have several meters of canyons and deep part of river that is suitable for canyoning activities. Canyoning is frequently done in remote and rugged settings and often requires navigational, route-finding and other wilderness travel skills. Canyoneering and Bouldering On April 9, 2017 five explorers from Camarines Norte was given a permit by Nelson P. Delos Santos (Municipal Mayor) and Mr. Manuel Racho (Municipal Tourism Officer) to explore the Nacali Falls river and mampurog river as part of their dream to create a comprehensive list of waterfalls and different natural attractions in the province. One member of the team, Mr. Benjie S. Ilagan is a resident of Barangay Mampurog and has visited Nacali Falls for more than five times. The other members of the team are as follows: Mr. Kimber Kaye S. Reyes as the team leader and navigator; Mr. Chris A. Camus the scribe; Mr. Gilbert Parale the timer and Mr. Jossiah Nathaniel M. Parena, aspiring to become a mountaineer and the youngest member of the group. A preliminary exploration was conducted prior to the actual exploration for the preparation and planning of the team. The team was surprised to see several meters of canyons and deep part of river that is suitable for canyoning Activities. The waterfalls can also be used for rappelling activities. The team also saw different waterfalls created by the big boulders present in the river. After six hours of river trekking and canyoning from the Nacali Falls river junction, the team found out that due to the limited time of the exploration, Mampurog river was not reached. Thus, the team recommends to the municipal Mayor and the tourism officer to allow them to explore the place in the future.  Flora  The recent discovery of a R. manillana haven in Mt. Guinatungan, a lesser-known mountain in Camarines Norte, Philippines, not only provided additional locality of distribution, but also resulted to better understanding of the taxonomic complexity of the Rafflesia species. While available literatures cite Rafflesia as critically endangered, it seems otherwise in Camarines Norte. A recent Rafflesia expedition showed significant populations of this species. This situation calls for a multi-agency approach in management and actions integrating research and development that are focused on the conservation and protection not only of the species but more importantly its host and habitat. Mr. George De Mesa Cordovilla, one of the participants in the “Tukad Bicol, Tukad Labo” Bantayog Festival climb organized by the Oryol Outdoor Group Inc. on April 15, 2016 was able to take a snapshot of the rafflesia flower. Mr. Cordovilla is from Albay and is known as the expert climber of Mayon.

The book tells of teenager Vicky Austin and her struggle to understand life and significance in the universe as she deals with her dying grandfather, while at the same time finding true romantic love. The title originates from a phrase in the seventeenth-century Welsh poet Henry Vaughan's poem \\"The World.\\" Henry Vaughan, \\"The World.\\" https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45434/the- world-56d2250cca80d Plot summary Fifteen-year-old Vicky Austin and her family are spending the summer on Seven Bay Island with her maternal grandfather, who is dying of leukemia. At the beginning of the story, Vicky attends a funeral for Commander Rodney, a family friend. Also present are the commander's wife, his sons Leo and Jacky who own a launch boat business, and Adam Eddington, an intern at the Island's research base and friend of Vicky's brother, John. After the funeral Vicky encounters Zachary Gray, her boyfriend from the previous summer whom her family does not particularly like. She soon learns that Zachary indirectly caused Commander Rodney's death; the commander had his heart attack while saving Zachary from a suicide attempt. This revelation and others set Vicky on a train of thought that continues throughout the book; the mysterious and (to Vicky) frightening topic of death. Death and the threat of it seem to loom everywhere, from news reports to the death of a baby dolphin, from the recent demise of Zach's mother in an automobile accident to Grandfather Eaton's slow deterioration. During the course of the story, Vicky finds herself in a tangle of three romances; one with the solid, unexciting Leo, one with dark and dangerous Zachary, and one with the gentle but emotionally damaged Adam, whom she is helping with a project on dolphin and human communication (ESP) with three dolphins: Basil, Norberta, and Njord. Vicky discovers a remarkable rapport with the dolphins, an unspoken communication that borders on telepathy. Her ability extends to communicating with Adam as well, but he pulls away, unwilling to allow that level of intimacy after a devastating betrayal the previous summer. Meanwhile, Vicky must help out at home, facing her grandfather's increasing confusion as he identifies Vicky with his dead wife. He has also been hemorrhaging, and Vicky often goes with Leo to pick up blood. There at the hospital, she meets a girl named Binnie who is sick with a type of leukemia and has seizures. Binnie's father is radically religious and is constantly disposing of the medication that controls the seizures. One night, her grandfather starts to hemorrhage and is sent to the hospital. Vicky is on a date with Zachary, and does not know about her grandfather's medical crisis until they come to the dock and see that Leo is not there to pick them up. Zachary rushes Vicky to the hospital, and eventually abandons her there. As she waits in the emergency room, she is spotted by Binnie's mother, who leaves her unconscious daughter with Vicky while she goes to find a nurse. Binnie has a convulsion and dies in Vicky's arms. This latest trauma sends Vicky into a wave of darkness, an almost catatonic state in which she is only vaguely aware of reality. Vicky's parents and Leo, who are already upset because Vicky's grandfather has been bleeding internally, try unsuccessfully to comfort and communicate with her. Then she feels hands on hers - Adam's. He tells her that she \\"called\\" him (meaning with ESP) and he came. The next day, Vicky is still in a wave of darkness. Her grandfather tells her that it is hard to keep focused on the good and positive in life but she must bear the light or she will be consumed by darkness. He also removes the emotional burden he placed on her earlier, when he asked her to tell him when it was time to die. Vicky is unable to listen, too caught up in her own misery. Finally Adam takes her into the ocean, where Vicky's dolphin friends break through her mental darkness, until she is able to play with them and face the light again. Major themes The primary theme of the story is death, and continuing to appreciate and choose life in the face of it. Vicky is surrounded by death during the summer of the story, and the people around her have their own responses to it as well. Slowly dying from leukemia, Grandfather Eaton encourages Vicky to enjoy life while developing her talent for writing, and only gradually begins to make unreasonable demands as his own mental clarity starts to fail. Having lost his father, Leo Rodney questions his previously comfortable faith, while taking responsibility for the family's income. Zachary, whose mother died recently, alternately courts death - driving too fast, flying recklessly in a plane - and runs away from it. Adam, who holds himself responsible for the death of Joshua Archer the previous summer (in The Arm of the Starfish) because he trusted a girl, is reluctant to open his heart and risk being hurt again. In addition to the deaths of Commander Rodney and Binnie and the impending death of her grandfather, Vicky meets a dolphin researcher who nearly dies in an accident, sees a dolphin swim with her dead baby, and even worries about baby swallows in a shallow, ill-placed nest. Related to this is the theme of religious faith in the face of death, a problem Vicky previously confronted in The Moon by Night. After observing her grandfather's joyful faith even in the midst of death and impending death at Commander Rodney's funeral, Vicky sees how Rodney's death has shaken his son Leo's once comfortable faith, and is confronted again with Zach's nihilism. After a brief period of despair after the death of Binnie, Vicky's faith is restored by the dolphins, whose songs she compares with \\"alien alleluias\\". Major characters *Vicky Austin -- The heroine of the Austin family series of novels and stories, Vicky is the first person narrator of this book and others. \\"Almost\\" sixteen years old at the time of the novel, Vicky is caught between a need for independence and her family responsibilities as she maintains somewhat troubled relationships with three very different boys, develops her talent for writing poetry, and attempts to understand how the death that seems to surround her can co-exist with the loving God her dying grandfather proclaims. *John Austin -- Vicky's scientifically-minded older brother, John, is a student at M.I.T.. Although he is primarily interested in astrophysics, he has taken a summer intern position working at a marine biology research station, where he has become friends with Adam Eddington. Kind and philosophical, he is able to help Vicky when she feels snubbed by Adam, due to his knowledge of Adam's personal history and activities. *Suzy Austin -- Generally considered the beauty of the family, and talented in ways Vicky is not, Suzy is the object of a certain amount of jealousy and sibling rivalry with her sister Vicky. Suzy has wanted to be a doctor \\"all my life,\\" but worries that she will not be able to make the transition from medical games with dolls to caring for living patients, being unable to make herself spend time with her dying grandfather. Suzy is fond of animals, and is interested in the dolphins at the research station. She takes a summer job helping Leo Rodney's brother Jacky with his launch business, which Vicky considers a \\"made-up job.\\" *Rob Austin -- The youngest of the Austin children, Robert Austin is curious and loving, with a penchant for insightful questions and unintentional wordplay. He spends much of the book playing with a child his own age at a neighbor's house, but is nevertheless deeply affected by his grandfather's illness and Vicky's eventual breakdown. Madeleine L'Engle has acknowledged that Rob is based on her own youngest child, Bion Franklin. *Dr. Wallace Austin, or \\"Wally\\", is the father of the four Austin children. Normally a \\"country doctor\\" in general practice, he has just concluded a year of research into the medical use of lasers in New York city, and is writing a book on the subject. *Victoria Austin, Vicky's mother and namesake, is the daughter of Reverend Eaton, a former singer who met her husband while singing at a hospital. Her main concern in the course of the book is for her dying father, and secondarily for the rest of her family. *Reverend Eaton, Vicky's grandfather, was a popular minister who also spent time as a missionary in Africa. He is a widower, having lost his wife Caro years before the events of Meet the Austins. He lives in a converted stable filled with books, from which he will often quote when making a religious or philosophical point. Now retired except for the occasional service, he is dying of leukemia, and sometimes confuses Vicky for Caro. At other times he is a wise counselor for Vicky, advising her about boys and God and death, and encouraging her in her writing. *Zachary Gray -- Extremely affluent but directionless, Zachary vacillates between his desires for redemption and self- destruction, especially in this book, his second appearance, where he half- heartedly attempts suicide as the story opens. He is described as being, \\"gorgeous\\", pale skinned, and with \\"velvety black\\" hair. He appears to have a heart condition. Charming, exciting, unpredictable and emotionally needy, Zach brings out both the best and worst in Vicky, and eventually deserts her in a moment of crisis. *Adam Eddington -- Marine biology student, who graduated from high school at 16 and already interned with at least two major authorities in the field before coming to the research station. Having been betrayed by Kali Cutter in The Arm of the Starfish, Adam tries to keep his emotional distance from Vicky while enlisting her in his dolphin communication project. He considers himself primarily a scientist rather than a poet like Vicky. *Leo Rodney -- son of the newly deceased Commander Rodney of the local Coast Guard station, he runs a charter launch business with his brother Jacky. He had hoped to attend college, but is prepared to give this up in order to help support his family; his mother returns to nursing instead. Less sure of eternal verities since his father's death, he reads extensively from Reverend Eaton's library and discusses God and death with Vicky, while seeking a more romantic relationship than Vicky is willing to allow him. Series notes This is the fourth full-length novel about Vicky and her family, continuing a series that began in 1960 with Meet the Austins. (There are also two shorter works that each take place at Christmas time.) Vicky first meets Zachary in the second novel, The Moon by Night, as he follows her from campground to campground on a cross-country trip. In the next book, The Young Unicorns, Zachary is mentioned only in passing. Concurrent with The Moon by Night is The Arm of the Starfish, a book from the O'Keefe family series that takes place the same summer as the Austins' camping trip. The Arm of the Starfish introduces as its protagonist Adam Eddington. Adam continues his relationship with Vicky Austin in the sixth and final Austin family novel, Troubling a Star. Awards and honors A Ring of Endless Light was named Newbery Honor Book in 1981.Association for Library Service to Children, List of Newbery Medal and Honor Books, 1922-Present. http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal.cfm It also won the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award, the California Young Reader Medal (1982) and the Colorado Children's Book Award (1983). TV movie In 2002, the Disney Channel made A Ring of Endless Light into a made- for-TV movie starring Mischa Barton and Ryan Merriman. The film's plot veered substantially from that of the book. Vicky's parents are conveniently absent for much of the movie. Vicky's astronomy-minded elder brother John is not mentioned, and Suzy is interested in astronomy instead of medicine. Grandfather Eaton's illness is undisclosed at first, instead of being the reason the family is spending the summer with him. Other examples of death and dying are absent entirely from the movie, along with such characters as Leo Rodney and his family, and the dying child Binnie. Whole-cloth additions to the story include Adam and Zachary teaming up to save dolphins from illegal drift nets, and Vicky being under pressure to study science in order to gain admission to an elite school.

This resident cuckoo is found from Mexico and Trinidad south to Bolivia and Argentina. The striped cuckoo is found in open country with trees or shrubs, and the edges of mangrove forests. It is among the very few brood parasitic cuckoos of the Americas (only other are Dromococcyx), and typical hosts are spinetails, but often also wrens, and other species with domed nests. The female cuckoo lays one, sometimes two, white or bluish eggs in the host's large stick nest. The eggs hatch in 15 days, with a further 18 days until the cuckoo fledges. The young spinetails disappear. This species is about long and weighs . The adult is mainly grey-brown above, streaked with black and buff. It has a pale supercilium and a chestnut and black crest which is raised as part of its display. The underparts are off-white and the tail is long and graduated. Immature birds are spotted with buff and are more rufous on the back and wings. The striped cuckoo eats large insects, often taken off the ground. This is a solitary and fairly shy species which tends to keep to the cover of bushes, although it will sing from more open perches. It has a whistled call usually of two or three notes, wu-weee or wu-wu-wee, and can be attracted by imitations of this.  Brazilian folklore  This bird is very important in Brazilian folklore, being related to the legend of the saci, or matita-perê. Other than saci, the bird is also known as matinta-pereira, pitica (Pará), crispim, fenfém, martim-pererê, matimpererê, matintapereira, matintaperera, matitaperê, peitica, peito-ferido, roceiro-planta, seco-fico, sede-sede, saci-do-campo, sem-fim, fém-fém, tempo-quente, bulhões, bolinhas, feijão, feijoada, jotalhão, gansolino, peixe-frito (Bahia), e peixe-frito-seu- veríssimo.

The Hand first appeared in Daredevil volume 1 #174 (September 1981) and was created by writer/artist Frank Miller. The Hand is an order of evil mystical ninjas who are heavily involved in organized crime and mercenary activities such as assassination plots. The Hand covets power above all other objectives. They are primarily based in Japan, but operate internationally. They were founded in 1588 as a secret society of Japanese nationalist samurai but were soon co-opted by the Snakeroot, an ancient ninja clan which serves a primordial demon known only as \\"The Beast of the Hand\\". Members of the Hand are practitioners of powerful occult magic and can murder a person and bring that person back to life as a servant of the Hand, but a few are known to have reversed this programming. The Hand's most dangerous adversary is The Chaste, a band of warriors once led by Stick, the blind martial arts master and mentor of Matt Murdock, who grew to become the costumed crime-fighter Daredevil. Murdock would eventually, after many bitter battles, accept the offer of becoming the master of the Hand for a time. The Hand made appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television shows Daredevil, Iron Fist, and The Defenders. Publication history The Hand first appeared in Daredevil volume 1 #174 (September 1981) and was created by writer/artist Frank Miller. Fictional organization history =Origins= The story begins 800 years ago, in feudal Japan. Seeking autonomy from the oppressive class system of the time, a few citizens fled into the mountainous regions of Iga and Kōga. There they developed ninjitsu, a stealthy martial art perhaps inspired by Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Over a period of centuries, they refined their art in secluded camps. Students trained and practiced the art from birth, playing children's games designed to impart expertise in unarmed combat, swordplay, weaponry, camouflage, escape, and evasion. Ninjitsu was also designed to encourage spiritual growth by pushing oneself physically and mentally beyond normal human limits. The ninja were experts in espionage and assassination, and offered their specialized services to samurai warlords and others who could afford them. Masters of every form of subterfuge, the ninja were the most efficient and deadly warriors on the face of the Earth and became feared throughout Japan. Hearsay gave rise to the myth that ninja were the spawn of the Tengu, and that their divinity gave them extraordinary abilities. These myths were likely spread by the ninja themselves. Nonetheless, it would seem that an ancient ninja clan known as the Snakeroot can and does trace their bloodline back to these demons. In 1588, Kagenobu Yoshioka became sensei of the Ishiyama Sword School located in the Japanese village of Kyushua. Facing growing frustrations with the corrupt government that had been tainted by foreign influence, Yoshioka transformed the school into a training ground for samurais whose goal was to put power back in the hands of the Japanese people. Thus, the Hand was born. Just as a hand has five fingers, members of the inner circle of the Hand were leaders of organizations which each operated from one of Japan's five islands. Upon the mutinous murder of Yoshioka, the Snakeroot ninja clan took control of the Hand and corrupted it by imposing the cult of a demon known as The Beast, which imbued them with dark magic. One of these black spells causes a Hand ninja's lifeless body to return to dust and prevent another from directly gazing at the Beast itself. Unlike the other factions of ninja, this \\"new\\" Hand both worked as mercenaries and sought power themselves. The Hand sought dominance over all others, working for allies of convenience while seeking to eliminate their enemies. =Modern times= After the end of World War II, a select few of the more politically oriented members of the Hand formed the original HYDRA as a cabal of Japanese ultranationalists who plotted to overthrow the Japanese liberal democratic government, assassinate the prime minister, and install a neo- militarist government, which would rearm Japan. Shortly upon joining HYDRA, Baron Strucker seized control of the organization from its Japanese founders and slowly steered the organization towards the goal of world domination. The Hand and HYDRA have nevertheless collaborated in numerous subversive or criminal conspiracies over the years. The Hand has survived into the early 21st century, still seeking power in various forms, and using their lethal skills and brutal methods. The Hand's most dangerous adversary is The Chaste, a band of warriors once led by Stick, the late, blind martial arts master and former mentor of the man who grew to become the costumed crime-fighter Daredevil (Matt Murdock). Another of his former pupils, Elektra Natchios, has also been involved with the Hand. She infiltrated the Hand, determined to prove herself to Stick. Instead, the ninja tricked her into killing one of her former sensei. Elektra served the Hand for a time, but after their ways corrupted her soul, she fled Japan back to America. Eventually, the Hand sought to wipe out Stick and the good warriors of the Chaste altogether. Stick thwarted an assassination attempt by four Hand operatives; he then summoned the other members of his order (Shaft, Stone, and Claw) to New York City. With the assistance of his clan, Stick defeated Kirigi, the Hand's most lethal ninja at the time. The Hand regrouped and attacked Stick and his band of warriors that now included Daredevil and his current lover, Black Widow. The Hand had almost overpowered the small band of warriors, when Stick and Shaft resorted to an ancient technique that drained the life force from all ninja present. Unfortunately, the technique resulted in the explosion of Stick and his comrade as a result of the excess energy they had absorbed. Despite their casualties and the escape of the Chaste's superhero allies, the Hand considered the destruction of their nemesis and leader of their enemy a victory and turned their attention to other schemes.Daredevil #189 Years later, the Hand turned its attention to the leaderless Chaste, once again attempting to destroy them, this time to prevent the Chaste's members from locating the new-born child that would bear Stick's reincarnated soul. The Hand severely crippled Stick's soldiers, reducing their number to a handful of warriors. The few remaining Chaste traveled to New York, seeking the assistance of Daredevil. Reluctantly, the Man Without Fear aided his former mentor's disciples, returning with them to Japan. Once there, the Hand attacked the Chaste and Daredevil relentlessly. Fighting alongside Daredevil, the Chaste barely managed to escape and safeguard their master's reincarnated spirit. The Hand has also frequently fought with Wolverine and come into conflict with superheroes such as Spider-Man,Amazing Spider-Man #651 the Avengers,New Avengers #29 and the X-Men.Uncanny X-Men #172 The Hand played a particularly large role in the history of Psylocke.Uncanny X-Men vol. 1 #256-258X-Men vol. 2 #31-32Psylocke #1-4 Elektra led the Hand for some time but when she was killed it was revealed that this Elektra was actually a Skrull,New Avengers #31 (2007) temporarily leaving the Hand without a warlord. One faction, led by Lord Hiroshi and his lieutenant Lady Bullseye, has aimed to make Daredevil their new leader, an offer the latter rejected, only to be told that \\"the Hand doesn't take no for an answer.\\" They then instigated the return of the Kingpin to New York City, with the goal of offering him the leadership instead. Kingpin's first act in negotiations is to kill Hiroshi with his bare hands, to \\"thank him\\" for realizing he can't escape his role as the Kingpin, and for murdering his girlfriend and her kids. However, the proceedings were interrupted by Daredevil, who accepted their offer, on the condition that the Hand should not do business with the Kingpin or Lady Bullseye again. The three remaining ninja-lords accepted this arrangement. During that time, the Hand gains Black Tarantula and White Tiger as members.Daredevil #111-119, 500 The Hand plays a major part in the 2010 \\"Shadowland\\" storyline where Daredevil uses the Hand as a force of justice. When Bullseye attacks his fortress, Daredevil ends up killing him in the same manner as Bullseye did to Elektra.Shadowland #1. Marvel Comics. Most of the street-based superheroes (consisting of Spider-Man, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Misty Knight, Moon Knight, Shang-Chi, and Colleen Wing) try to reason with Daredevil only for Kingpin and Lady Bullseye to unleash Ghost Rider upon Shadowland. Daredevil blames them for the diversion and has the Hand attack them.Shadowland #2. Marvel Comics. Following a fight with the street-based superheroes who escaped with Punisher's help, Daredevil states that he will plan to resurrect Bullseye to serve him. He is then approached by Elektra, who apparently swears her allegiance to him. The street-based heroes are visited by Master Izo, who states that the Snakeroot Clan plan to make Daredevil a vessel for the Beast of the Hand (who desires nothing but darkness and destruction).Shadowland #3. Marvel Comics. Later Colleen Wing learns from Daredevil that her mother had led a female faction of the Hand called the \\"Nail\\".Shadowland: Daughters of the Shadow #1. Marvel Comics. Colleen eventually accepts Daredevil's offer to join the Nail. It is shown that the Hand also has a faction called the Underhand which are a group of ninjas that are already dead. This, when Luke Cage is visited by his old friend Lacy Kimbro, who tells Luke that her son Darris is among the cops that are held prisoners by the Underhand.Thunderbolts #148 Realizing that Daredevil is possessed by the demonic Beast of the Hand, the heroes gather together to try to fight him themselves. Despite their efforts to interrupt Bullseye's resurrection ceremony, even a direct attack from Wolverine fails to kill the now-demonic Daredevil. Daredevil throws off Elektra and Spider-Man's attempts to reason with him, as he proclaims \\"There is no Murdock! There is only the Beast!\\".Shadowland #4. Marvel Comics. Although Iron Fist is able to heal Daredevil of the 'infection' by using his chi punch to cure Daredevil's soul, Kingpin and Typhoid Mary take advantage of the chaos in the aftermath of the war to take command of the Hand for themselves.Shadowland #5.

Other versions  The Kingpin contacts the Hand for assistance against the Punisher in the \\"Homeless\\" story-arc of Punisher Max. While the organization provides the Kingpin with Elektra for use as a bodyguard, it refuses to directly hunt and eliminate the Punisher due to having the utmost respect for the vigilante and his prowess at killing. The Hand is later revealed to be in league with Vanessa Fisk, who intends to have Elektra seduce and murder the Kingpin. After the Punisher cripples Elektra and kills the Kingpin, the Hand recovers the former, and euthanizes her when it becomes apparent that the severity of her injuries have rendered her incapable of ever walking again. In other media =Television= * In the Iron Man episode Hands of the Mandarin, Mandarin's minions Hypnotia, Blacklash, Whirlwind, and Blizzard are referred to as members of the Hand by the news media. * The Hand are introduced in Daredevil. In the first season, Alexandra forms an alliance with Wilson Fisk, using Madame Gao and Nobu Yoshioka as intermediaries. Fisk and the Ranskahov brothers traffic Gao's heroin while Nobu works with Fisk to acquire Elena Cardenas' tenement building so the Hand can use it as the foundation of Midland Circle. Nobu also uses his connections with Fisk to transport a \\"Black Sky\\", a person Alexandra considers an ideal weapon for the Hand's agenda, but Stick and Matt Murdock attack Nobu's party and Stick kills the Black Sky, creating friction between Nobu and Fisk. Fisk, wanting Nobu out of the way, has a junkie stab Elena to death and then give Matt information that lures him to an empty warehouse. Matt is ambushed by Nobu and the resulting battle ends with Matt setting Nobu on fire, seemingly burning him alive. Madame Gao, in the meanwhile, conspires with Leland Owlsley to have Vanessa Mariana poisoned in an attempt to get Fisk to focus on his criminal empire, but the attempt fails. She later leaves town after Matt leads the police to one of her drug labs. In the second season, the Hand resurrects Nobu and uses the blood of children to produce a new \\"Black Sky\\". Nobu is served by a redheaded woman named Tyler. The Hand's ninjas are indicated to have the ability to slow their heart rates, making it difficult for Matt's enhanced hearing and radar sense to detect them, though he is aided by Elektra and Stick. Madame Gao makes an appearance late in the season where it's revealed she is a competitor to the mysterious \\"Blacksmith\\" behind the death of Frank Castle's family. Nobu takes Karen Page, Turk Barrett and others hostage as bait for Matt. Elektra is killed protecting Matt from Nobu, before Matt and Frank dispatch Nobu's followers, and Stick beheads Nobu. Alexandra arranges for Elektra's exhumed body to be resurrected with the last of the dragon bones as the \\"Black Sky\\". * The Hand appear in season one of Iron Fist. Madame Gao's ties to the Hand are revealed along with a number of associates serving her to include brothers Andrei and Grigori Veznikov, the Bride of Nine Spiders, Scythe, King, Alexi, Vando, and Zhou Cheng. Her branch uses Rand Enterprises as a front to smuggle heroin into New York City, thanks to having brokered a deal with Harold Meachum to resurrect him after his death. Bakuto is a leader of a faction of the Hand who runs a camp that recruits orphaned and runaway kids. Colleen Wing is a former student of Bakuto, and uses her dojo's classes to supply him with recruits. Danny Rand, the Iron Fist, is a guardian of K'un-Lun and sworn to destroy the Hand. Danny is shocked to learn about the Hand's infiltration of his father's company when he returns to New York City after a fifteen year absence. Danny manages to drive the Hand out of Rand, but in the process is betrayed by Harold, who attempts to frame him for their criminal activities. * The Hand appear in The Defenders. With Alexandra having months left to live before her organs fail and the Hand having used what's left of the \\"substance\\" to revive Elektra, she expedites their masterplan to extract fossilized dragons under Manhattan, in the process triggering an artificial earthquake. To facilitate the project, Sowande is hiring young men from Harlem to do dirty work, then killing them off once they served their purpose. This brings their activities to the attention of Detective Misty Knight, and later on Luke Cage after Sowande kills two brothers of Candace Miller, Misty's would-be witness against Mariah Dillard. Things begin to fall apart when John Raymond, the architect who built Midland Circle, realizes the Hand's plan and plots to destroy the building, a case which Misty also begins investigating after Jessica Jones discovers that Raymond has been stockpiling explosives in a seedy apartment. To silence Raymond, Alexandra sends Elektra to Jessica's apartment to capture him, but he shoots himself. Matt gets drawn into Jessica's investigation after Foggy asks him to keep an eye on her as a favor for Jeri Hogarth. Matt, Jessica, Luke and Danny all later meet up when their investigations into the Hand lead them to Midland Circle. After fighting off Elektra and several waves of henchmen, they escape to the Royal Dragon, where Stick shows up and gives them a rundown on the Hand's leaders. Alexandra, Elektra, Murakami, Madame Gao and Sowande track the heroes down to the restaurant and attempt to capture Danny, but they escape, with Luke successfully capturing Sowande after a drawn-out fight. Stick later decapitates Sowande when he tries to kidnap Danny and mails his head to Alexandra in a box as a message. Alexandra's authority is further challenged when Elektra begins to remember her past association with Matt. Elektra later captures Danny, killing Stick in the process, and then abruptly kills Alexandra while asserting control of the Hand. Elektra takes Danny down into the pit the Hand have been digging below Midland Circle, and provokes him into using the Iron Fist to break down a wall that blocks the Hand from accessing the dragon bones. Matt, Luke and Jessica, who have been picked up by the NYPD in light of Stick's murder, escape the 29th Precinct and return to Midland Circle backed up by Colleen, Claire and Misty. Colleen manages to kill Bakuto after he cut off Misty's right arm. The heroes then proceed to carry out Raymond's plan to implode Midland Circle, which fills the hole. Matt is presumed killed in the collapse, but is later shown to have survived. Elektra, Madame Gao and Murakami are dead under Midland Circle. =Film= * In the film Elektra (2005), the Hand is led by Master Roshi and its members include Kinkou, Tattoo, Typhoid Mary, Stone, and Roshi's own son Kirigi. The Hand's ninjas are clad in black while the opposing Chaste members are clothed in white. =Video games= * In X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Cammy is propositioned by the Hand, only to be rescued by Psylocke. * The Hand appears in the PSP version of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. In the game, Team X (led by Maj. William Stryker, and consisting of James Howlett, Victor Creed, John Wraith, Agent Zero, Frederick Dukes, and Wade Wilson) need to obtain information about an adamantium orb which was later grafted on Howlett to be the Wolverine. After that, brothers Creed and Howlett discover the location of the Hand. Creed pursues the leader while Howlett fights the army of the Hand. Creed is defeated, so when Howlett pursues the leader, she activates a robot which Howlett destroys. The leader decides not to fight him as he is a formidable opponent, and Howlett decides the same only to be thrown in a lava pit by Creed. * The Hand's hideout is one of the stages in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. * In Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, in addition to The Hand Hideout reappearing, Shadowland will feature including Hand Ninjas and Daredevil. In addition, one of Strider Hiryu's alternate costumes is directly influenced by The Hand. * The Hand appears in Marvel: Avengers Alliance. Bullseye and Elektra are shown to be associated with the group. Its foot soldiers consist of Hand Assassins (which are masters of dual-wielding tantos), Hand Dragons (which are masters of melee and can counter any melee attacks), Hand Ninjas (which are masters of sneak attacks and use smoke bombs), Hand Scorpions (which use their naginatas to Pinion an opponent leaving their Evasion down), Hand Shadows (whom use their dual tantas to cause their victims to bleed), Hand Shinobis (which are masters of the naginatas), Hand Soldiers (which are masters of the katanas), Hand Spies (which rely on their dual tantas to cause their victims to bleed), and Hand Warriors (who rely on blinding their opponents and lowering their accuracy). * The Hand appears in Marvel Heroes. In popular culture * The Foot Clan in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics and all related media were created as a homage to the Hand.

The longest- serving and 4th Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, he served as the Chief Minister from 2012 to 2017 before being replaced by BJP's Jai Ram Thakur in December 2017. He previously served as Chief Minister from 1983 to 1990, from 1993 to 1998 and from 2003 to 2007. He was an elected member of the Lok Sabha in 1962, 1967, 1971, 1980 and in 2009. He is a member of the Indian National Congress. His wife, Pratibha Singh, was a Lok Sabha member from Mandi. Personal life Virbhadra Singh was born on 23 June 1934 at Sarahan, Shimla district in the royal family of the princely state of Bushahr. Singh was educated at Colonel Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun, St. Edward's School, Shimla & Bishop Cotton School, Shimla and later obtained a BA Honours degree from St. Stephen's College, Delhi. He was married to Ratna Kumari in May 1954. http://loksabhaph.nic.in/writereaddata/biodata_1_12/1689.htm The couple's daughter Abhilasha Kumari is a former judge who served on the High Court of Gujarat from 2006 to 2018. In 1986, he was married for the second time, to Pratibha Singh. His second wife was elected to Lok Sabha from Mandi in 2004. National politics Singh gained a seat in the Lok Sabha — which is the lower house of the Parliament of India — in the Indian general elections of 1962. He repeated that success in the elections of 1967 and 1971. He was again elected to the Lok Sabha in 1980 and a further election to that house came in 2009, following an absence from the intervening two Lok Sabhas. His wife had served a term following her victory in the 2004 elections. He was a member of the Indian Delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1976. Between 1976 and 1977, Singh held the national office of Deputy Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation in central cabinet. He was Minister of State for Industries between 1980 and 1983. From May 2009 until January 2011, he held the cabinet post of Minister for Steel. He then became cabinet minister with responsibility for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, until resigning from office in June 2012. State politics Aside from his role in national politics, Singh has also been elected on seven occasions to the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly. The first occasion was in a by-election in October 1983, when he was returned for the Jubbal-Kotkhai constituency. He won that seat again in the 1985 elections. Thereafter, he was elected from the Rohru constituency in 1990, 1993, 1998 and 2003. Singh became the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh for the first time in April 1983 and held the post until March 1990. He was again appointed to the role between December 1993 and March 1998; and once more from March 2003. With reappointments within those years, this record amounted to him holding the office on five occasions. Between 1998 and 2003, Singh was Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly. He was also president of the Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee from February 1992 to September 1994, and leader of the Congress Legislative Group. He was president of the State Congress Committee in 1977, 1979 and 1980. In July 2012, he quit all key party posts at a crucial time prior to the state elections of November 2012. It has been reported that the trigger for the resignations was his exclusion from the Screening Committee for short- listing of election candidates. Singh was appointed to lead the party on the eve of the November 2012 elections and did so with success. The party then agreed to him becoming Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh for a record sixth time. His party lost majority in the 2017 elections and he tendered his resignation afterwards. Social and cultural activities Outside of politics, Singh has involvement with various social and cultural bodies. A consequence of these interests is that he has been president of the Sanskrit Sahitya Sammelan and of the Himachal Pradesh branch of the Friends of the Soviet Union. Corruption charges On 3 August 2009, a legal case was registered against Singh and his wife by the Anti-Corruption Bureau of Himachal Pradesh. The allegations were that they had breached the Prevention of Corruption Act in 1989, when Singh was Chief Minister of the state. The Bureau alleged that it had evidence in recorded conversations between the couple and various others concerning suspect financial transactions. The alleged recordings, which involved a now-dead officer of the Indian Administrative Service and several industrialists, dated from 2007 and were provided by a political opponent, Vijai Singh Mankotia. The couple were granted bail in December 2010 but in April 2011 the state government requested that this be rescinded due to allegations of witness tampering. This request followed attempts by two industrialists to remove themselves from the prosecution case, claiming that the evidence was forged and incorrect. The Singhs have attempted to have the matter taken out of police hands and passed to the Central Bureau of Investigation, as well as seeking a stay on further trial court proceedings. In January 2012, the Himachal Pradesh High Court had refused the latest of their petitions aimed at achieving the transfer and stay. The court ordered that the examination of potential charges and evidence by a trial court should go ahead. On 26 June 2012, Singh resigned from the Union Cabinet as a consequence of corruption charges being pressed against him. The couple were acquitted on the eve of Singh taking the role of Chief Minister in December 2012. =CBI inquiry= In 2015 the Central Bureau of Investigation filed a case against Singh and his family for owning assets to the tune of Rs. 6.1 crore disproportionate to his known sources of income when he was the union minister between 2009 and 2011.

Voyages and star observation Little is known of Keyser's life outside of his astronomical observations and East Indies voyages. After several trips, one to Brazil, and one to Nova Zembla, Keyser participated as the chief navigator and head of the steersmen for the first Dutch voyage to the East Indies (the \\"Eerste Schipvaart\\"), which left Texel with four ships on 2 April 1595 under Cornelis de Houtman. He had been trained by cartographer Petrus Plancius in mathematics and astronomy. Plancius, a key promoter to the Dutch East Indies expeditions, had instructed Keyser to map the skies in the southern hemisphere, which were largely uncharted at the time. When the fleet finally was able to obtain fresh supplies at Madagascar on 13 September, 71 of the 248 sailors had died, most of scurvy. The surviving crew stayed for several months on the island, to recover and make repairs, at which point Keyser probably made most of his celestial observations. He was aided in this by Frederick de Houtman and Vechter Willemsz. After leaving Madagascar, it took another four months (February to June 1596) for the ships to reach Sumatra and finally Bantam on Java. Trade negotiations went sour, perhaps caused by Portuguese instigators, perhaps by inexperience, and the crew was forced to find drinking water and other supplies on Sumatra across the Sunda Strait. Keyser apparently died during this crossing. On 14 August 1597, 81 survivors made it back to Texel, including de Houtman, who probably delivered Keyser's observations to Plancius. Constellations From the observations of the expedition, Plancius created a celestial globe in late 1597, published by Jodocus Hondius, showing twelve new constellations of the southern sky that have become accepted among the standard constellations codified by modern astronomers. The majority were named after various animals that 16th century explorers had encountered (e.g. Bird of Paradise, Chameleon, Toucan, Flying Fish). Willem Janszoon Blaeu copied these constellations on a 1602 globe and created a new globe in 1603 incorporating further observations made by de Houtman on a second voyage to the East Indies. Johann Bayer included these new southern constellations in his influential 1603 star atlas Uranometria, crediting them to \\"Petrus Theodori\\" (Pieter Keyser), but not acknowledging their earlier publication. Bayer is therefore often mistakenly credited for introducing them. Keyser is commemorated by minor planet (10655) Pietkeyser.

It found Baez beginning to update her image (which she would continue to do on subsequent releases) by including songs like \\"Children of the Eighties\\" (her own composition, written for the children born after the 1960s) alongside old fan favorites like \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" and \\"Farewell Angelina\\". She subsequently rewrote some of the lyrics of \\"Warriors of the Sun\\", as can be heard on the version of the song that appears on 1989's Speaking of Dreams. The album was not released in the US, due to Baez's lack of a US recording contract at the time. The German version of the album substituted the German songs \\"Wozu sind Kriege da\\" and \\"Wenn unsere Brüder kommen\\" for the album's two French songs.

The village is about 18 kilometres south-west of Grafton on the banks of the Orara River along the Armidale-Grafton Road. The village is named after Thomas Coutts, a settler who established the nearby Kangaroo Creek pastoral station in 1840. Coutts is best known as being the perpetrator of a mass poisoning of Aboriginals on the Kangaroo Creek run. This occurred in late 1847 and resulted in the deaths of 23 people. Coutts was arrested and sent to Sydney for trial but the case was dismissed. He returned to the area and was able to continue acquiring pastoral properties further north. British occupation in the immediate vicinity around Coutts Crossing began in 1840 with the arrival of pastoral squatter William Forster. He set up a sheep station in the area which he named Purgatory due to the high level of Aboriginal resistance he encountered while taking possession of the land. He later changed the name of the station to Geergarow, which is commemorated today in the name of the main road heading west from the township of Coutts Crossing. The village itself was established as a service centre for the local farming community in the 1860s. However, today the village is a dormitory suburb with majority of residents commuting into Grafton. Despite this, the village boasts a tavern, general store, community hall and church. Coutts Crossing Public School was established in 1913 and has 99 pupils enrolled. In the last twenty-five years, a number of sporting and community services have been established, including tennis and squash courts as well as football and croquet grounds, a nine-hole golf course, a pre-school, a heritage centre and a combined New South Wales Rural Fire Service and State Emergency Service centre, established in 1997.

Promoted by the non-profit OpenID Foundation, it allows users to be authenticated by co-operating sites (known as relying parties, or RP) using a third-party service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc login systems, and allowing users to log into multiple unrelated websites without having to have a separate identity and password for each. Users create accounts by selecting an OpenID identity provider and then use those accounts to sign onto any website that accepts OpenID authentication. Several large organizations either issue or accept OpenIDs on their websites, according to the OpenID Foundation. The OpenID standard provides a framework for the communication that must take place between the identity provider and the OpenID acceptor (the \\"relying party\\"). An extension to the standard (the OpenID Attribute Exchange) facilitates the transfer of user attributes, such as name and gender, from the OpenID identity provider to the relying party (each relying party may request a different set of attributes, depending on its requirements). The OpenID protocol does not rely on a central authority to authenticate a user's identity. Moreover, neither services nor the OpenID standard may mandate a specific means by which to authenticate users, allowing for approaches ranging from the common (such as passwords) to the novel (such as smart cards or biometrics). The final version of OpenID is OpenID 2.0, finalized and published in December 2007. The term OpenID may also refer to an identifier as specified in the OpenID standard; these identifiers take the form of a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and are managed by some \\"OpenID provider\\" that handles authentication. Adoption , there are over 1 billion OpenID-enabled accounts on the Internet (see below) and approximately 1,100,934 sites have integrated OpenID consumer support: AOL, Flickr, France Telecom, Google, Amazon.com, Canonical (provider name Ubuntu One), LiveJournal, Microsoft (provider name Microsoft account), Mixi, Myspace, Novell, OpenStreetMap, Orange, Sears, Sun, Telecom Italia, Universal Music Group, VeriSign, WordPress, Yahoo!, the BBC, IBM, PayPal, and Steam, although some of those organizations also have their own authentication management. Many if not all of the larger organizations require users to provide authentication in the form of an existing email account or mobile phone number in order to sign up for an account (which then can be used as an OpenID identity). There are several smaller entities that accept sign-ups with no extra identity details required. Facebook did use OpenID in the past, but moved to Facebook Connect. Blogger also used OpenID, but since May 2018 no longer supports it. Technical overview An end-user is the entity that wants to assert a particular identity. A relying party (RP) is a web site or application that wants to verify the end-user's identifier. Other terms for this party include \\"service provider\\" or the now obsolete \\"consumer\\". An identity provider, or OpenID provider (OP) is a service that specializes in registering OpenID URLs or XRIs. OpenID enables an end-user to communicate with a relying party. This communication is done through the exchange of an identifier or OpenID, which is the URL or XRI chosen by the end-user to name the end-user's identity. An identity provider provides the OpenID authentication (and possibly other identity services). The exchange is enabled by a user-agent, which is the program (such as a browser) used by the end-user to communicate with the relying party and OpenID provider. =Logging in= The end-user interacts with a relying party (such as a website) that provides an option to specify an OpenID for the purposes of authentication; an end-user typically has previously registered an OpenID (e.g. \`alice.openid.example.org\`) with an OpenID provider (e.g. \`openid.example.org\`). The relying party typically transforms the OpenID into a canonical URL form (e.g. \`http://alice.openid.example.org/\`). * With OpenID 1.0, the relying party then requests the HTML resource identified by the URL and reads an HTML link tag to discover the OpenID provider's URL (e.g. \`http://openid.example.org/openid-auth.php\`). The relying party also discovers whether to use a delegated identity (see below). * With OpenID 2.0, the relying party discovers the OpenID provider URL by requesting the XRDS document (also called the Yadis document) with the content type \`application/xrds+xml\`; this document may be available at the target URL and is always available for a target XRI. There are two modes in which the relying party may communicate with the OpenID provider: * \`checkid_immediate\`, in which the relying party requests that the OpenID provider not interact with the end-user. All communication is relayed through the end-user's user-agent without explicitly notifying the end-user. * \`checkid_setup\`, in which the end-user communicates with the OpenID provider via the same user-agent used to access the relying party. The \`checkid_immediate\` mode can fall back to the \`checkid_setup\` mode if the operation cannot be automated. First, the relying party and the OpenID provider (optionally) establish a shared secret, referenced by an associate handle, which the relying party then stores. If using the \`checkid_setup\` mode, the relying party redirects the end-user's user-agent to the OpenID provider so the end-user can authenticate directly with the OpenID provider. The method of authentication may vary, but typically, an OpenID provider prompts the end-user for a password or some cryptographic token, and then asks whether the end-user trusts the relying party to receive the necessary identity details. If the end-user declines the OpenID provider's request to trust the relying party, then the user-agent is redirected back to the relying party with a message indicating that authentication was rejected; the relying party in turn refuses to authenticate the end-user. If the end-user accepts the OpenID provider's request to trust the relying party, then the user-agent is redirected back to the relying party along with the end-user's credentials. That relying party must then confirm that the credentials really came from the OpenID provider. If the relying party and OpenID provider had previously established a shared secret, then the relying party can validate the identity of the OpenID provider by comparing its copy of the shared secret against the one received along with the end- user's credentials; such a relying party is called stateful because it stores the shared secret between sessions. In contrast, a stateless or dumb relying party must make one more background request (\`check_authentication\`) to ensure that the data indeed came from the OpenID provider. After the OpenID has been verified, authentication is considered successful and the end-user is considered logged into the relying party under the identity specified by the given OpenID (e.g. \`alice.openid.example.org\`). The relying party typically then stores the end-user's OpenID along with the end-user's other session information. =Identifiers= To obtain an OpenID-enabled URL that can be used to log into OpenID-enabled websites, a user registers an OpenID identifier with an identity provider. Identity providers offer the ability to register a URL (typically a third-level domain, e.g. username.example.com) that will automatically be configured with OpenID authentication service. Once they have registered an OpenID, a user can also use an existing URL under their own control (such as a blog or home page) as an alias or \\"delegated identity\\". They simply insert the appropriate OpenID tags in the HTML or serve a Yadis document. Starting with OpenID Authentication 2.0 (and some 1.1 implementations), there are two types of identifiers that can be used with OpenID: URLs and XRIs. XRIs are a new form of Internet identifier designed specifically for cross-domain digital identity. For example, XRIs come in two forms—i-names and i-numbers—that are usually registered simultaneously as synonyms. I-names are reassignable (like domain names), while i-numbers are never reassigned. When an XRI i-name is used as an OpenID identifier, it is immediately resolved to the synonymous i-number (the CanonicalID element of the XRDS document). This i-number is the OpenID identifier stored by the relying party. In this way, both the user and the relying party are protected from the end-user's OpenID identity ever being taken over by another party as can happen with a URL based on a reassignable DNS name. OpenID Foundation The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) promotes and enhances the OpenID community and technologies. The OIDF is a non-profit international standards development organization of individual developers, government agencies and companies who wish to promote and protect OpenID. The OpenID Foundation was formed in June 2007 and serves as a public trust organization representing an open community of developers, vendors and users. OIDF assists the community by providing needed infrastructure and help in promoting and supporting adoption of OpenID. This includes managing intellectual property and trade marks as well a fostering viral growth and global participation in OpenID. =People= The OpenID Foundation's board of directors has four community members and eight corporate members: Community Board Members *Chairman: Nat Sakimura (Nomura Research Institute) *Treasurer: John Bradley (Ping Identity) *Secretary: Mike Jones (Microsoft) *Community Representative: George Fletcher (AOL) Corporate Board Members *Google – Adam Dawes *Janrain – Jim Kaskade *Microsoft – Anthony Nadalin *Oracle – Prateek Mishra *Ping Identity – Pam Dingle *Symantec – Brian Berliner *US Department of Health & Human Services, Office of the National Coordinator – Debbie Bucci *Verizon – Bjorn Hjelm *VMware – Ashish Jain = Chapters = OIDF is a global organization to promote digital identity and to encourage the further adoption of OpenID, the OIDF has encouraged the creation of member chapters. Member chapters are officially part of the Foundation and work within their own constituency to support the development and adoption of OpenID as a framework for user-centric identity on the internet. = Intellectual property and contribution agreements = The OIDF ensures that OpenID specifications are freely implementable therefore the OIDF requires all contributors to sign a contribution agreement. This agreement both grants a copyright license to the Foundation to publish the collective specifications and includes a patent non-assertion agreement. The non-assertion agreement states that the contributor will not sue someone for implementing OpenID specifications. =Legal issues= The OpenID trademark in the United States was assigned to the OpenID Foundation in March 2008. It had been registered by NetMesh Inc. before the OpenID Foundation was operational. In Europe, as of August 31, 2007, the OpenID trademark is registered to the OpenID Europe Foundation. The OpenID logo was designed by Randy \\"ydnar\\" Reddig, who in 2005 had expressed plans to transfer the rights to an OpenID organization. Since the original announcement of OpenID, the official site has stated: Sun Microsystems, VeriSign and a number of smaller companies involved in OpenID have issued patent non-assertion covenants covering OpenID 1.1 specifications. The covenants state that the companies will not assert any of their patents against OpenID implementations and will revoke their promises from anyone who threatens, or asserts, patents against OpenID implementors. Security =Authentication bugs= In March, 2012, a research paper reported two generic security issues in OpenID. Both issues allow an attacker to sign into a victim's relying party accounts. For the first issue, OpenID and Google (an Identity Provider of OpenID) both published security advisories to address it. Google's advisory says \\"An attacker could forge an OpenID request that doesn't ask for the user's email address, and then insert an unsigned email address into the IDPs response. If the attacker relays this response to a website that doesn't notice that this attribute is unsigned, the website may be tricked into logging the attacker in to any local account.\\" The research paper claims that many popular websites have been confirmed vulnerable, including Yahoo! Mail, smartsheet.com, Zoho, manymoon.com, diigo.com. The researchers have notified the affected parties, who have then fixed their vulnerable code. For the second issue, the paper called it \\"Data Type Confusion Logic Flaw\\", which also allows attackers to sign into victim's RP accounts. Google and PayPal were initially confirmed vulnerable. OpenID published a vulnerability report on the flaw. The report says Google and PayPal have applied fixes, and suggest other OpenID vendors to check their implementations. =Phishing= Some observers have suggested that OpenID has security weaknesses and may prove vulnerable to phishing attacks. For example, a malicious relaying party may forward the end-user to a bogus identity provider authentication page asking that end-user to input their credentials. On completion of this, the malicious party (who in this case also controls the bogus authentication page) could then have access to the end-user's account with the identity provider, and then use that end-user's OpenID to log into other services. In an attempt to combat possible phishing attacks, some OpenID providers mandate that the end- user needs to be authenticated with them prior to an attempt to authenticate with the relying party. This relies on the end-user knowing the policy of the identity provider. In December 2008, the OpenID Foundation approved version 1.0 of the Provider Authentication Policy Extension (PAPE), which \\"enables Relying Parties to request that OpenID Providers employ specified authentication policies when authenticating users and for OpenID Providers to inform the Relying Parties which policies were actually used.\\" = Privacy and trust issues = Other security issues identified with OpenID involve lack of privacy and failure to address the trust problem. (originally published on The Identity Corner at www.idcorner.org/?p=161) However, this problem is not unique to OpenID and is simply the state of the Internet as commonly used. The Identity Provider does, however, get a log of your OpenID logins; they know when you logged into what website, making cross-site tracking much easier. A compromised OpenID account is also likely to be a more serious breach of privacy than a compromised account on a single site. =Authentication hijacking in unsecured connection= Another important vulnerability is present in the last step in the authentication scheme when TLS/SSL are not used: the redirect-URL from the identity provider to the relying party. The problem with this redirect is the fact that anyone who can obtain this URL (e.g. by sniffing the wire) can replay it and get logged into the site as the victim user. Some of the identity providers use nonces (number used once) to allow a user to log into the site once and fail all the consecutive attempts. The nonce solution works if the user is the first one to use the URL. However, a fast attacker who is sniffing the wire can obtain the URL and immediately reset a user's TCP connection (as an attacker is sniffing the wire and knows the required TCP sequence numbers) and then execute the replay attack as described above. Thus nonces only protect against passive attackers, but cannot prevent active attackers from executing the replay attack. Use of TLS/SSL in the authentication process can significantly reduce this risk. This can be restated as: Superscript textIF (Both RP1 and RP2 have Bob as a client) AND // a common case (Bob uses the same IDP with both RP1 and RP2) AND // a common case (RP1 does not use VPN/SSL/TLS to secure their connection with the client) // preventable! THEN RP2 could obtain credentials sufficient to impersonate Bob with RP1 END-IF #REDIRECT #REDIRECT Target page name =Covert Redirect= On May 1, 2014, a bug dubbed \\"Covert Redirect related to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID\\" was disclosed. It was discovered by mathematics doctoral student Wang Jing at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The announcement of OpenID is: \\"'Covert Redirect', publicized in May 2014, is an instance of attackers using open redirectors – a well-known threat, with well-known means of prevention. The OpenID Connect protocol mandates strict measures that preclude open redirectors to prevent this vulnerability.\\" \\"The general consensus, so far, is that Covert Redirect is not as bad, but still a threat. Understanding what makes it dangerous requires a basic understanding of Open Redirect, and how it can be exploited.\\" A patch was not immediately made available. Ori Eisen, founder, chairman and chief innovation officer at 41st Parameter told Sue Marquette Poremba, \\"In any distributed system, we are counting of the good nature of the participants to do the right thing. In cases like OAuth and OpenID, the distribution is so vast that it is unreasonable to expect each and every website to patch up in the near future\\". History The original OpenID authentication protocol was developed in May 2005 by Brad Fitzpatrick, creator of popular community website LiveJournal, while working at Six Apart. Initially referred to as Yadis (an acronym for \\"Yet another distributed identity system\\"), it was named OpenID after the openid.net domain name was given to Six Apart to use for the project. OpenID support was soon implemented on LiveJournal and fellow LiveJournal engine community DeadJournal for blog post comments and quickly gained attention in the digital identity community. Web developer JanRain was an early supporter of OpenID, providing OpenID software libraries and expanding its business around OpenID-based services. In late June, discussions started between OpenID users and developers from enterprise software company NetMesh, leading to collaboration on interoperability between OpenID and NetMesh's similar Light-Weight Identity (LID) protocol. The direct result of the collaboration was the Yadis discovery protocol, adopting the name originally used for OpenID. The new Yadis was announced on October 24, 2005. After a discussion at the 2005 Internet Identity Workshop a few days later, XRI/i-names developers joined the Yadis project, contributing their Extensible Resource Descriptor Sequence (XRDS) format for utilization in the protocol. In December, developers at Sxip Identity began discussions with the OpenID/Yadis community after announcing a shift in the development of version 2.0 of its Simple Extensible Identity Protocol (SXIP) to URL-based identities like LID and OpenID. In March 2006, JanRain developed a Simple Registration (SREG) extension for OpenID enabling primitive profile-exchange and in April submitted a proposal to formalize extensions to OpenID. The same month, work had also begun on incorporating full XRI support into OpenID. Around early May, key OpenID developer David Recordon left Six Apart, joining VeriSign to focus more on digital identity and guidance for the OpenID spec. By early June, the major differences between the SXIP 2.0 and OpenID projects were resolved with the agreement to support multiple personas in OpenID by submission of an identity provider URL rather than a full identity URL. With this, as well as the addition of extensions and XRI support underway, OpenID was evolving into a full-fledged digital identity framework, with Recordon proclaiming \\"We see OpenID as being an umbrella for the framework that encompasses the layers for identifiers, discovery, authentication and a messaging services layer that sits atop and this entire thing has sort of been dubbed 'OpenID 2.0'. \\" In late July, Sxip began to merge its Digital Identity Exchange (DIX) protocol into OpenID, submitting initial drafts of the OpenID Attribute Exchange (AX) extension in August. Late in 2006, a ZDNet opinion piece made the case for OpenID to users, web site operators and entrepreneurs. On January 31, 2007, Symantec announced support for OpenID in its Identity Initiative products and services. A week later, on February 6 Microsoft made a joint announcement with JanRain, Sxip, and VeriSign to collaborate on interoperability between OpenID and Microsoft's Windows CardSpace digital identity platform, with particular focus on developing a phishing-resistant authentication solution for OpenID. As part of the collaboration, Microsoft pledged to support OpenID in its future identity server products and JanRain, Sxip, and VeriSign pledged to add support for Microsoft's Information Card profile to their future identity solutions. In mid-February, AOL announced that an experimental OpenID provider service was functional for all AOL and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) accounts. In May, Sun Microsystems began working with the OpenID community, announcing an OpenID program, as well as entering a non-assertion covenant with the OpenID community, pledging not to assert any of its patents against implementations of OpenID. In June, OpenID leadership formed the OpenID Foundation, an Oregon-based public benefit corporation for managing the OpenID brand and property. The same month, an independent OpenID Europe Foundation was formed in BelgiumOpenID Europe Foundation by Snorri Giorgetti. By early December, non-assertion agreements were collected by the major contributors to the protocol and the final OpenID Authentication 2.0 and OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0 specifications were ratified on December 5. In mid-January 2008, Yahoo! announced initial OpenID 2.0 support, both as a provider and as a relying party, releasing the provider service by the end of the month. In early February, Google, IBM, Microsoft, VeriSign and Yahoo! joined the OpenID Foundation as corporate board members. Around early May, SourceForge, Inc. introduced OpenID provider and relying party support to leading open source software development website SourceForge.net. In late July, popular social network service MySpace announced support for OpenID as a provider. In late October, Google launched support as an OpenID provider and Microsoft announced that Windows Live ID would support OpenID. In November, JanRain announced a free hosted service, RPX Basic, that allows websites to begin accepting OpenIDs for registration and login without having to install, integrate and configure the OpenID open source libraries. In January 2009, PayPal joined the OpenID Foundation as a corporate member, followed shortly by Facebook in February. The OpenID Foundation formed an executive committee and appointed Don Thibeau as executive director. In March, MySpace launched their previously announced OpenID provider service, enabling all MySpace users to use their MySpace URL as an OpenID. In May, Facebook launched their relying party functionality, letting users use an automatic login-enabled OpenID account (e.g. Google) to log into Facebook. In September 2013, Janrain announced that MyOpenID.com would be shut down on February 1, 2014; a pie chart showed Facebook and Google dominate the social login space as of Q2 2013. Facebook has since left OpenID; it is no longer a sponsor, represented on the board, or permitting OpenID logins. In May 2016, Symantec announced that they would be discontinuing their pip.verisignlabs.com OpenID personal identity portal service. In March 2018, StackOverflow announced an end to OpenID support, citing insufficient usage to justify the cost. In the announcement, it was stated that based on activity, users strongly preferred Facebook, Google, and e-mail/password based account authentication. OpenID vs. pseudo-authentication using OAuth OpenID is a way to use a single set of user credentials to access multiple sites, while OAuth facilitates the authorization of one site to access and use information related to the user's account on another site. Although OAuth is not an authentication protocol, it can be used as part of one. > Authentication in the context of a user accessing an application tells an > application who the current user is and whether or not they're > present.[...]Authentication is all about the user and their presence with > the application, and an internet-scale authentication protocol needs to be > able to do this across network and security boundaries.

This is great > for client authorization, but it's really bad for authentication where the > whole point is figuring out if the user is there or not (and who they are). The following drawing highlights the differences between using OpenID vs. OAuth for authentication. Note that with OpenID, the process starts with the application asking the user for their identity (typically an OpenID URI), whereas in the case of OAuth, the application directly requests a limited access OAuth Token (valet key) to access the APIs (enter the house) on user's behalf. If the user can grant that access, the application can retrieve the unique identifier for establishing the profile (identity) using the APIs. OpenID vs. Pseudo-Authentication using OAuth =Attack against pseudo- authentication= OpenID provides a cryptographic verification mechanism that prevents the attack below against users who misuse OAuth for authentication. Note that the valet key does not describe the user in any way, it only provides limited access rights, to some house (which isn't even necessarily the user's, they just had a key). Therefore if the key becomes compromised (the user is malicious and managed to steal the key to someone else's house), then the user can impersonate the house owner to the application who requested their authenticity. If the key is compromised by any point in the chain of trust, a malicious user may intercept it and use it to impersonate user X for any application relying on OAuth2 for pseudo authentication against the same OAuth authorization server. Conversely, the notarized letter contains the user's signature, which can be checked by the requesting application against the user, so this attack is not viable. Verifying the letter The letter can use public-key cryptography to be authenticated. * The requesting application provides its encryption public key to the user, which provides it to the Authentication server. * The authentication server encrypts a document containing an encryption key which corresponds to a one way hash of a secret the user knows (e.g. passphrase) for challenge response using the application's public key. * The user passes the encrypted document back to the application, which decrypts it. * The application encrypts a random phrase using the received encryption key, and asks that the user do the same, then compares the results, if they match, the user is authentic. OpenID Connect Published in February 2014 by the OpenID Foundation, the third generation of OpenID technology, OpenID Connect, is an authentication layer that sits on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. It allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain the basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. In technical terms, OpenID Connect specifies a RESTful HTTP API, using JSON as a data format. OpenID Connect allows a range of parties, including web-based, mobile and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users.

The film depicts the nightmarish experiences of a psychologically fragile woman who comes to believe that another strange, mysterious young woman she has let into her home may actually be a vampire. Initially conceived by writer Lee Kalcheim as a satirical horror film about a group of hippies preyed upon by a monster in a lake, the screenplay was significantly reworked after director Hancock signed on to the project. Hancock took certain elements from Kalcheim's script, but opted to write a straightforward horror film set at a remote farmhouse. Inspired by the psychological implications of Henry James' novella The Turn of the Screw and Robert Wise's film The Haunting (1963), Hancock wanted to center the screenplay on a protagonist whose credibility interpreting events could be questioned by the audience so they could use their imagination. Filming of Let's Scare Jessica to Death took place in various towns and villages in Connecticut, largely in Middlesex County. Though completed without a distributor, the film was purchased by Paramount Pictures, who gave it a wide release in the United States in late August 1971. The film received middling reviews from critics at the time, with some remarking the atmosphere and performances, while others criticized the sparse and ambiguous narrative. Though criticism of the film has been divided, it went on to attain a cult following, and some film scholars have drawn comparisons to Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Carmilla (1871). In 2006, the Chicago Film Critics Association pronounced Let's Scare Jessica to Death one of the scariest films ever made. The film was difficult to obtain on home media formats for several decades, available only on VHS until 2006, when Paramount issued a DVD version. A Blu- ray was released by Scream Factory in January 2020.  Plot  Jessica (Zohra Lampert) has been released from a mental institution to the care of her husband, Duncan (Barton Heyman), who has given up his job as string bassist for the New York Philharmonic and purchased a rundown farmhouse on an island in upstate New York. When Jessica, Duncan, and their hippie friend Woody (Kevin O'Connor) arrive, they are surprised to find a mysterious drifter, Emily (Mariclare Costello), already living there. When Emily offers to move on, Jessica invites her to dine with them and stay the night. The following day, Jessica, seeing how attracted Woody is to Emily, asks Duncan to invite her to stay indefinitely. Jessica begins hearing voices and sees a mysterious young blonde woman (Gretchen Corbett) looking at her from a distance before disappearing. Later, Jessica is grabbed by someone under the water in the cove while she is swimming. Jessica is afraid to talk about these things with Duncan or Woody, for fear that they will think she is relapsing. She also becomes aware that Duncan seems to be attracted to Emily, and that the men in the nearby town, all of whom are bandaged in some way, are hostile towards them. Duncan and Jessica decide to sell antiques found in the house at a local shop, one of which is a silver-framed portrait of the house's former owners, the Bishop family—father, mother, and daughter Abigail. The antique dealer, Sam Dorker (Alan Manson), tells them the story of how Abigail drowned in 1880 just before her wedding day. Legend claims that she is still alive, roving the island as a vampire. Jessica finds the story fascinating, but Duncan, afraid that hearing about such things will upset his wife, cuts Dorker short. Later, as Jessica prepares to make a headstone rubbing on Abigail Bishop's grave, she notices the blonde woman beckoning her to follow. The woman leads Jessica to a cliff, at the bottom of which lies Dorker's bloodied body. By the time Jessica finds Duncan, however, the body is gone. Jessica and Duncan spot the woman standing on the cliff above them, causing Duncan to give chase. When the woman is caught and questioned by the couple, she remains silent and quickly flees when Emily approaches. That night, Duncan tells Jessica that she needs to return to New York to resume her psychiatric treatment. Jessica forces him to sleep on the couch, where he is seduced by Emily. The next day, Jessica finds the portrait of the Bishop family, which she and Duncan had sold to Dorker the previous day, back in the attic; she observes that Abigail Bishop, as seen on the photo, bears a striking resemblance to Emily. Jessica agrees to go with Emily to swim in the cove. While swimming, Emily vanishes from sight; Jessica hears Emily's voice in her head and watches as Emily emerges from the lake in a wedding gown. Emily attempts to bite her neck, but Jessica flees, locking herself in her bedroom in the house. Hours pass and Jessica leaves to hitch a ride into town. Woody, who has been working in the orchard, returns to the house, where Emily bites his neck. When Jessica gets into town, she sees Duncan's car and asks about his whereabouts, but no one will speak to her; she then encounters Sam Dorker, and terrified, runs back to the house. She collapses in the orchard and later is found by Duncan, who takes her home. In their bedroom, the couple go to lie down; Jessica notices a cut on Duncan's neck, and Emily then enters the room brandishing a knife, with the townsmen following behind her. Jessica flees the house, knocking over Duncan's bass case, which contains the corpse of the mute woman. Jessica runs through the orchard and comes across Woody's corpse, his throat slashed. At daybreak, Jessica makes it to the ferry and tries to board, but the ferryman refuses to let her on. She jumps into a nearby rowboat and paddles out into the lake. When a hand reaches into the boat from the water, she stabs the person in the back several times with a pole hook. As the body floats away, she sees that it is Duncan. From the shore, Emily and the townsmen watch her. Analysis The film has been compared by several literature and film scholars to the novella Carmilla (1872) Some literature and film scholars have drawn comparisons between Let's Scare Jessica to Death and Irish novelist Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Carmilla (1871), which tells the story of a vampiress. Scholar Nancy West cites the film as one of several examples of horror films of the 1970s that directly lift the premise of the novel and place it in other historical or cultural contexts: \\"This languid movie reimagines Le Fanu's Laura as Jessica...like Carmilla, Emily is a horror of a houseguest, and after both men have been bitten by her, it becomes apparent that Emily is none other than the one-hundred-year-old vampire who in the course of time has attacked all the men in the nearby town...Is Emily an imaginative projection of Jessica's murderous feelings toward her husband? Of Jessica's frustration with a mental condition that has rendered her sadly dependent on men? The film never makes clear.\\" The decline of 1960s counterculture has been cited as a theme by critics and observers. The hearse that Duncan and Jessica drive, which has with the word \\"love\\" spray-painted on it, has been noted as a blatant reference to the death of \\"hippie values.\\" Critic and biographer Michael Doyle describes the film as a \\"haunting elegy\\" for the failures of the hippie movement. Doyle elaborates that the film \\"isolates and illuminates the death and corruption of counterculture values\\" from the era, and anticipates the \\"festering paranoia\\" that occurred throughout the 1970s, with the Watergate scandal, the assassinations of Harvey Milk and George Moscone, and the Jonestown massacre. Director John Hancock, though ambivalent about whether it was consciously or subconsciously integrated into the screenplay, has conceded this interpretation, commenting: \\"You could already feel that negativity brewing when we were making Jessica; that things weren't working out the way some of us had hoped and dreamed they would.\\" Production =Development= According to Lee Kalcheim, the original script for the film was far different from the completed film. Hired by producer Charles B. Moss, Kalcheim's original screenplay, entitled It Drinks Hippie Blood, followed a group of hippies camping on a cove who are attacked by a creature that lives in the water. Kalcheim described his screenplay as a satire: \\"John [Hancock] turned- the-screw so to speak making it a serious, darker theme. The simplicity of the film worked perfectly to create a scary mood.\\" Hancock agreed to direct the film only as long as he was allowed to redraft the screenplay, and proceeded to rework Kalcheim's original script in both tone and thematic content, but retained certain elements at the request of the producers; the mute girl, played by Gretchen Corbett, for example, was a character from Kalcheim's original script that Moss requested Hancock retain in his redraft. The scene in which the group attempt a séance was also requested to be kept in the film by both Kalcheim and the producers. Hancock stated that \\"the scenes didn't make much sense to me, but the Mosses felt they would be particularly enjoyable and scary. I trusted their instincts because they had a concrete experience of audiences.\\" Kalcheim is credited as a co-writer on the film under the pseudonym Norman Jonas. Certain elements of the film were drawn from Hancock's own life, such as the apple orchard settings and farmhouse, as he had grown up on an apple orchard, as well as Norman's career as a bassist, as Hancock's father was a professional double-bass player. In writing the role of Jessica, Hancock sought to create a filmic equivalent to the unreliable narrator in literary fiction. Jessica was partly influenced by the governess in Henry James's novella The Turn of the Screw, as well as the character of Eleanor Lance in Robert Wise's film The Haunting (1963). The theme of evil pervading the protagonist's mind was central: \\"I was alarmed by the notion that you can't defeat or defuse evil—it forever lives inside and all around us—so I worked that fear inside the story,\\" said Hancock. =Casting= The film's principal female cast, from left to right: Zohra Lampert, Mariclare Costello, and Gretchen Corbett. Of all the cast members, Corbett was the only actress who had not previously worked with director John Hancock Hancock, who had worked as a theater director prior, cast the film largely through his connections within the New York theater community, and the majority of the cast consisted of actors with whom Hancock had worked in stage productions. Auditions for the parts were held in the B.S. Moss Offices on Broadway in New York City. Actress Zohra Lampert was cast in the lead role of Jessica, the titular character who finds herself questioning her sanity. She was approached by Hancock, her former boyfriend, while performing in a Broadway production of Mother Courage and Her Children with Anne Bancroft. \\"I accepted, trusting his judgement,\\" Lampert recalled. \\"I have a great fondness for John Hancock, and enjoyed working with him very much.\\" Lampert \\"got lost in her character\\" as the script resonated with her, and she spent much of her time between takes remaining in character. Hancock recalled of her casting: \\"I knew she would be perfect for the lead role. Zohra could play the fragility of the character, but she could also authentically convey the fear and the terror.\\" Mariclare Costello, an actress who had worked as a casting director on Hancock's stage production of The Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake (1967), was cast opposite Lampert as the mysterious hippie, Emily. Hancock was specifically taken by Costello's physical features, which included bright red hair and a pale complexion, which he felt was befitting of the vampiric Emily. Barton Heyman and Kevin O'Connor were given the roles of Jessica's husband Duncan, and the couple's friend Woody, respectively; Hancock had worked with Heyman and O'Connor previously, as they had appeared in his 1967–1968 stage production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Heyman had been Hancock's first choice in the role of Duncan. Alan Mason, who portrayed the doomed antique dealer Sam Dorker, had also acted in several of Hancock's plays. Gretchen Corbett, also an established New York-based stage actress from Portland, Oregon, was cast as the mysterious mute girl whom Jessica encounters, and was the only performer in the principal cast to have not worked with Hancock prior. In preparation, both Lampert and Costello worked with acting coach Mira Rostova for their respective roles in the film. To prepare the performers for the tone he hoped to accomplish, Hancock screened several films by Alfred Hitchcock to the cast prior to filming. =Filming= Let's Scare Jessica to Death was filmed over a period of 26 days in the fall of 1970, in various towns in Connecticut; the production budget was $250,000. Principal photography began in November of that year in Old Saybrook. The exteriors of the house were shot at a farmhouse in Old Saybrook, while the E.E. Dickinson Mansion, located in the village of Essex, was used for the interior shots of the home. While shooting, the cast and crew used multiple rooms in the expansive mansion for dressing rooms and a headquarters for the film company. Additional photography occurred in the villages of Chester, Lyme, and East Haddam. The Chester–Hadlyme Ferry is featured in the film crossing the Connecticut River. Co-producer William Badalato had suggested the location: \\"My wife and I had a weekend house in Chester, Connecticut. We loved the area and shared our feelings with John [Hancock] and [producer Charles B. Moss Jr.] After a preliminary scout we all agree that this was where Jessica should be filmed.\\" Badalato recalled of Hancock's direction: \\"He was always responsible to our budget and was very confident with the actors. He felt close to the material as it spoke to him in some bizarre way. John actually used to take his own pulse while he was shooting and I was completely intrigued by this.\\" Because the film was shot in the fall months, the sequences that were shot in the lake required the actors to swim in very cold water. The scene in which Costello's character emerges from the lake in a wedding dress was filmed in late November on a day in which it had snowed. =Music= Let's Scare Jessica to Death was one of the first horror films to prominently feature a synthesizer in its musical score, which was composed by Orville Stoeber. The song sung by Costello's character was initially going to be dubbed by a professional singer, but Hancock and the producers decided to keep her voice as it was recorded. Release =Box office= Filmed without a distributor and produced independently (under The Jessica Company), Let's Scare Jessica to Death was sold to Paramount Pictures in early 1971. Frank Yablans, then an executive at Paramount, devised the film's title as they felt Hancock's working title, which was simply Jessica, was not commercially viable. Paramount gave the film a wide theatrical release in the United States. It premiered in New York City on August 27, 1971, and opened in Los Angeles, California the following week, on September 1, 1971. Fake plastic vampire fangs were given to patrons at some cinemas in promotion of the film, while a horse-drawn hearse and coffins were parked in front of Manhattan's Criterion Theatre during the film's opening week. During its opening week of August 27–September 1 at the Criterion, the film grossed a total of $47,651. =Critical response= Contemporaneous Upon its release, Stanley Kanfer of Time gave the film a middling review, praising Lampert's performance but dismissing the rest of the cast's, adding that \\"after the first reel, the vampires seem to have lost their bite.\\" Roger Greenspun of The New York Times also praised Lampert's performance and lauded the film, calling it a \\"thinking man's vampire movie, probably a secret dream for at least half the world's young filmmakers.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times remarked the \\"strong sense of atmosphere\\" in the film in addition to the four lead performances, who are \\"likable, believable people,\\" but conceded: \\"There's no getting around the movie's poorly resolved script.\\" The San Francisco Examiners Stanley Eichelbaum also noted deficiencies in the screenplay, noting that the film \\"seems improvised and nothing could be worse for this kind of structured suspense thriller. Hancock's direction is ridiculously disjointed and inconsistent.\\" This sentiment was echoed by Kevin Kelly of The Boston Globe, who felt the film contained so many idiosyncrasies that \\"nothing rings true.\\" Jack Meredith of the Windsor Star described the film as a \\"far-out bit of froth\\" that \\"nevertheless packs continuing suspense and a what's-going-to-happen-next element that never lets down through about 1½ hours of sustained action.\\" Writing for the Edmonton Journal, Barry Westgate was critical of the film, noting: \\"Even contrived cinema has to have its share of rhyme or reason, and this effort by John Hancock doesn't have so much as a touch of either.\\" Ann Guarino of the New York Daily News commented on the film's ambiguous plot, writing that it \\"presents the problem and leaves you to solve it... The film may not take the curl out of your hair, but it will hold your interest even if the title will throw you off—there actually is no plot to scare Jessica.\\" She also praised the performances of Lampert and Costello, as well as those of Heyman and O'Connor, but noted of the latter that their \\"characters are not well developed by the script.\\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Donald Miller wrote that \\"after the first ten minutes... I thought director John Hancock... was onto something—if not a new genre, then perhaps something as arresting as the Cat People,\\" but felt that it devolved into a \\"routine vampire romp,\\" though he did praise the cinematography and visuals. Modern Contemporary critical reviews of the film have been mixed: Film scholar John Stanley gave the film a favorable review in his 1995 book, writing: \\"Director John Hancock is to be congratulated for a multi-layered horror film with frightening visuals. There isn't much logic to the story, yet the overall effect is unsettling... the film has a dream-like quality.\\" AllMovie deemed it an \\"eerie low-budget chiller.\\" Film scholar Gary A. Smith remarked Lampert's performance as Jessica as \\"laid back to the point of somnambulism. Lampert gives a performance so overwrought that it has to rank as one of the most eccentric ever captured on film.\\" In 2006, Eric Henderson of Slant gave the film an unfavorable review, writing: \\"A lesbian panic melodrama in New England gothic drag, the only things separating Let's Scare Jessica to Death from its cinematic descendants are its narrative incoherence, its lack of a directorial presence (especially surprising considering the colloquial implications of the director's name), [and] its drab, douche commercial mise-en-scène.\\" Author and independent filmmaker John Kenneth Muir gave the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars, praising the film's cinematography, \\"unsettling\\" mood, and its ability to generate a sense of unease, calling it \\"very disturbing\\" and noting its \\"lovely and poetic\\" visuals. Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2 1/2 out of a possible 4 stars, calling it \\"creepy.\\" In a 2013 article published by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, Erik Luers wrote of the film: \\"The technical qualities of Let's Scare Jessica to Death are superb. With gorgeous cinematography and an audio track that takes on a life of its own, each sound and image presents a hazy version of reality. As the plot develops, we learn that the world around Jessica is scarier than anything her mind could concoct.\\" Genre scholar Kim Newman has praised the film, specifically Lampert's performance, which he ranks as equal to those of Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974), Carrie Snodgress in Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970), Shirley Knight in The Rain People (1969), and Susannah York in Images (1972), all \\"portrait[s] of a woman in distress.\\" 2020 review from The Super Network's film critic Marcella Papandrea gave the film a very positive review saying \\"The atmosphere and the soundtrack are haunting pieces, the film is very unnerving from start to finish, as the view is with an unreliable narrator and thr audience feels what Jessica feels throughout.\\" also reading into the subtext of Jessica's psychological state and downfall to that of the death of the counter culture movement of the 60s. =Home video= The film was released on VHS and Beta by Paramount Pictures in 1984, but later went out of print and was difficult to obtain. Paramount released the film on DVD on August 29, 2006, and reissued it on September 15, 2009. Warner Brothers later released the film on August 27, 2013, through its Warner Archive DVD-on-demand service. On July 20, 2019, Scream Factory announced at San Diego Comic-Con that they would be issuing the film on Blu-ray, marking its debut in this format. The Blu-ray was released on January 28, 2020 and includes a commentary track from director John D. Hancock and producer Phil Badalato, interviews with composer Orville Stoeber and historian Kim Newman, a documentary on the filming locations, and other bonus features. Legacy Let's Scare Jessica to Death has been named one of the scariest films of all time by several critical publications: In 2006, the Chicago Film Critics Association pronounced Let's Scare Jessica to Death the 87th scariest film ever made. According to Steve Senski of Trailers from Hell, Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling called the film \\"one of the most frightening films he'd ever seen in his life.\\" Film scholar Kim Newman, as well as fiction writers Charles L. Grant and Stephen King, are among those who have named it one of their favorite horror films. Sara Century, writing for Syfy, noted the significance of the film: \\"While the response is entirely subjective and it isn’t a film for everyone, Jessica did in many ways serve as a forerunner for what would come later, as filmmakers like David Lynch would delve into dreamscapes that refused to sustain themselves explicitly in cohesive narratives. As with many movies, the tone of Jessica is what matters, and that is indeed where it succeeds.\\" In the early 2010s, London's Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films, who ranked the film number 86 in a list of 100 films.

It was one of the Epic Cycle, that is, the Trojan cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The story of the Little Iliad comes chronologically after that of the Aethiopis, and is followed by that of the Iliou persis (\\"Sack of Troy\\"). The Little Iliad was variously attributed by ancient writers to Lesches of Pyrrha (7th century BCE), Cinaethon of Sparta (8th century BCE), Diodorus of Erythrae, Thestorides of Phocaea, or Homer himself (8th century BCE) (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised four books of verse in dactylic hexameter, the heroic meter. Date The Little Iliad was probably composed in the latter half of the seventh century BCE, but there is much uncertainty. Ancient sources date Lesches to the seventh century; but it is typical for ancient writers to place archaic literary authors earlier (sometimes centuries earlier) than the period they actually lived. Content The Little Iliad is one of the better- attested epics in the Epic Cycle: nearly thirty lines of the original text survive. Nevertheless, we are almost entirely dependent on a summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the Chrestomatheia attributed to an unknown Proclus (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century CE grammarian Eutychius Proclus). Numerous other references give indications of the poem's storyline. The poem, \\"a fast-paced episodic epic with a lot of ground to cover\\"Philip Holt, \\"Ajax's Burial in Early Greek Epic\\", The American Journal of Philology 113.3 (Autumn 1992:319-331) p. 319. — which opened it to Aristotle's criticism that it had more plot than an epic should haveAristotle, Poetics, 1459b. — opens with the judgment of Achilles's arms, which are to be awarded to the greatest Greek hero: the contest is between Ajax and Odysseus, who recovered Achilles's body in battle. With the help of Athena, the arms are awarded to Odysseus, and Ajax goes insane and attacks the Achaeans' herd. Later, in shame, he commits suicide, and is buried without full heroic honours, in a coffin rather than cremated on a funeral pyre, \\"because of the anger of the king\\", Agamemnon.Porphyry, cited by Eustathius, quoted in Holt 1992. The inhumation is a unique occurrence in the Epic Cycle (and so noted by pseudo- Apollodorus) — \\"out of keeping with funeral practices elsewhere in epic, and for that matter, outside epic as well\\" (Holt p. 320) — perhaps reflecting alternative burial practices familiar in Homer's own day, which attributed cremation to the heroic Mycenaean age. Calchas, the Greek prophet, prophesies that the city of Troy will not fall unless the Greeks recover the arrows of Heracles from the hero Philoctetes, who was left behind on Lemnos when he was bitten by a poisonous snake. In accordance with this prophecy, Odysseus and Diomedes go to Lemnos to bring back Philoctetes, who is healed of his wound by Machaon. Philoctetes then fights Paris in single combat and kills him. After Paris's death, Helenus and Deiphobus fight over Helen. Deiphobus wins and marries her. The defeated Helenus angrily abandons Troy in spite and moves to Mount Ida. Odysseus, who is a recurrent figure of interest in the Little Iliad,Noted by D.B. Monro, \\"The poems of the Epoc Cyle\\", Journal of the Hellenic Society, 5 (1884:1-41) pp 23f. ambushes Helenus and captures him; Helenus then reveals three new prophecies concerning the preconditions for the Greeks' conquest of Troy, notably, that the city will not fall while it harbours the Palladium. The other two conditions are that the bones of Pelops are recovered from Pisa, a rival of Elis, and that Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, is brought into the war. While a ship of Mycenaeans sail to Pisa to bring back the bones of Pelops, Odysseus brings Achilles's son Neoptolemus to Troy and gives him his father's armor. Achilles's ghost appears to him. When the Trojan ally Eurypylus dominates the field in battle, Neoptolemus kills him. Odysseus and Diomedes go into Troy disguised as beggars, where Helen recognises them but keeps their secret; they return safely with the Palladium, killing some Trojans on the way. On the goddess Athena's initiative, the Greek warrior Epeius builds the wooden horse, and the Greeks place their best warriors inside it, burn their camp, and withdraw to the nearby island Tenedos. The Trojans, believing that the Greeks have departed for good, breach a section of their city wall to bring the horse inside, and celebrate their apparent victory. The emergence of the heroes from the horse, and the Greeks' destruction of Troy, seem not to be recounted in the Little Iliad, but are left for the Iliou persis. Nonetheless, a substantial fragment which is securely attributed to the Little Iliad describes how Neoptolemus takes Hector's wife Andromache captive and kills Hector's baby son, Astyanax, by throwing him from the walls of the city.Little Iliad fr. 29 in West's edition (= Tzetzes ad Lycophron. 1268). The Little Iliad does not seem to have been redacted in a single, authoritative version, according to varying accounts of its details that cannot securely be harmonised.Alberto Bernabé Pajares, \\"¿Mas de una Ilias Parva?\\" Estudios clásicos, 26.1 (1984:141-50).

Exemplars of izbu compendia first appear in the old Babylonian period but it is not until the late second millennium that it is thought to have reached canonical form and exemplars of teratomantic texts from this era have been found in Assur and Babylon as well as further afield in Susa, Emar, Ugarit and Ḫattuša. The most complete form of the text comes from copies in the library of Ashurbanipal. The text It was one of the works cited by the astrologer Marduk-šāpik-zēri as evidence of his learning in his letter to Aššur-bāni-apli in search of employment. Its esoteric nature was emphasized by the royal astrologer Balasi, in his letter to the same king: In common with other works of omens, each clause is formed from a protasis giving the antecedent and an apodosis giving the consequence. In common with the Sakikkū (SA.GIG), it arranges the malformations ištu muḫḫi adi šēpi, “from head to foot,” and in the color sequence: white, black, red, green–yellow, and variegated. Some of the tablets focus on malformations of single body parts, such as horns (tablet 9), eyes (tablet 10) and ears (tablet 11) and others record the behavior of adult animals as well as their offspring, such as tablet 22 which begins treating with the birth of piglets of monstrous shape (kūbu) and then goes on to describe the behavioral anomalies in sows, pigs in general, and wild boars. The series includes omens of public apodoses (mostly tablets 1–17), “If a woman gives birth, and at birth (the child) is already as white as alabaster—end of the reign; omen of a despotic king,” Šumma Izbu, Tablet IV, 12. and private apodoses (mostly tablets 18–24), “If a woman gives birth to an ecstatic [maḫḫu], male or female, she has been impregnated in the street by a sinful man.” The sinful man being one who has leprosy (garbānu) or dropsy (male mê). For the most part, private omens concerned the fortunes of the bēl bīti, head of a household, or the owner of a flock or herd and related to life and death, health, general condition, relationship with the gods, social status, family and economic circumstances. “If a woman gives birth to a dog: the owner of the house will die, and his house will be scattered; the land will go mad; pestilence.” For public omens, the subject might relate to the king and his immediate family, or more generally the country as a whole, “There will be bad times. The mother will bar her door against her daughter; there will be no [sense of] brotherhood.” The work follows the common left- right polarity, where right is generally auspicious, left not so, where for example a deformity to the right ear is bad, to the left ear is good and two right ears are good whereas two left ears are perceived to be bad. The work shares much in common with some of the izbu omens in the Šumma ālu series, from which it may have borrowed, or alternatively provided a source for these “unprovoked” omens. A late Babylonian commentary relates some of the omens to astrological observations: References Category:Divination Category:Mesopotamian literature Category:Astrological texts Category:Clay tablets ","title":"Summa izbu"},{"id":"2084005","text":"The National Library of Peru () is the national library of Peru, located in Lima. It is the country's oldest and most important library. Like the majority of Peruvian libraries, it is a non-circulating library. It has two branches. The old building is on Abancay Avenue (Lima District) and the modern building is on Javier Prado Avenue (San Borja District). Both are open to the public.  History  The library was founded by José de San Martín in 1821, after he donated his collection of books and praised the new library as: \\"... one of the most efficient mediums to place into circulation our intellectual values.\\" The library has various duties, among which it must formulate, conduct, supervise, and evaluate the fulfillment of policies and plans of development of library service within a national and international sphere for educational purposes. These and other administrative decisions concerning the library also depend on the ministry of education of the country. Historically, the library has passed through various phases of restructuring since its foundation. During the War of the Pacific, the Chilean army, after taking Lima, ransacked various items along with much capital stock from the library. Peruvian author and scholar Ricardo Palma, who was director of the library in 1884, noted in one of his recounts that of the 56,000 works the library possessed before the war, only 378 were left at the end of the occupation. In 2007, 3,778 books were returned to Peru from Chile.Chile: Plundered Books Returned There are current talks between the director of the library and Chilean authorities on identifying works which might belong to Peru that would be eventually returnable. Another significant event the library has gone through was a fire which almost completely destroyed the grounds of the library on May 10, 1943, in which various highly valued historical works were lost.LOST MEMORY - LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES DESTROYED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ( ) A new building was erected on the same grounds of the old library along with a training center for future librarian administrators. Modernization The National Library of Peru is currently undergoing a modernization program which aspires to turn the library into one of Latin America's most modern libraries. It is located in Lima's San Borja district. After years of financial planning for the new building, the government of Peru financially collaborated to finish the building, along with a loan of up to seven million dollars from Spain to equip the new library with modern equipment. According to official sources from the library, it is said to have a bibliographic patrimony valued at around 400 million dollars. Among historical works the library has is the first book printed in Lima in 1584 along with other historical books dating back to colonial times. The new library will also attempt to connect to other Peruvian libraries in an effort to create an online national catalog of books and other materials for better research. The new library was officially inaugurated on March 27, 2006. To mark the occasion, the then Minister of Education, Javier Sota Nadal, commissioned a symphonic poem from Peruvian composer Jimmy Lopez. The work titled, \\"America Salvaje\\", is inspired by the poem \\"Blasón\\" by José Santos Chocano. President Alejandro Toledo and National Library director Sinesio López were present at the inauguration.

The film stars Rod Taylor, Catherine Spaak, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Michael Rennie, Merle Oberon, and Melvyn Douglas. It is directed by Richard Quine. Plot The story takes place at the fictional St Gregory Hotel in New Orleans, owned by Warren Trent. The hotel is in financial trouble. Hotel manager Peter McDermott involves himself in the proposals from three potential buyers of the property. He also takes a romantic interest in Jeanne Rochefort, the beautiful French mistress of one of the bidders, and deals with a wide range of routine problems, including a faulty elevator. Jeanne is the mistress of Curtis O'Keefe, who intends to renovate and \\"modernize\\" the hotel, with conveyor belts carrying luggage automatically around the building as if it were some sort of modern airport terminal, and even presenting the customer's bill on a conveyor belt. While this is O'Keefe's vision for a hotel of the future, his immediate plans for the St. Gregory are different: He would remove the fountain in the center of the lobby and replace it with a circular news stand and bookstore; he would remove the comfortable lobby seating, forcing guests to go to a restaurant or lounge and spend money to sit; he would change the mezzanine promenade with rows of little shops; and he would chop up the great suites into smaller guest rooms. Among the guests at the hotel are the Duke and Duchess of Lanbourne, a wealthy couple hiding out after fleeing from an accident in their car. A hotel detective, Dupere, attempts to blackmail the Duke and Duchess. The Duchess responds by asking Dupere to drive the car from the accident to Washington D.C. for $25,000 ($ today), but he gets caught outside of the city. Keycase, a professional thief, is working the hotel using a range of techniques and some female accomplices. In the beginning of the film he picks up a discarded key found in an ashtray at the airport. During the course of the film he sneaks into hotel rooms and steals the guests' money, but now that they can buy things by credit card, he finds that most of the guests carry very little cash. Meanwhile, a black couple, Dr. Elmo Adams and his wife, attempt to rent a room at the St. Gregory, having previously made a reservation. However, Trent tells the assistant manager filling in for McDermott (McDermott having been offered a sexual liaison with Jeanne at his French Quarter apartment) not to allow them accommodation. The Adamses are denied their room, the couple then disappear only to be followed by a man with a camera. When McDermott finds out he berates Trent for doing something that would jeopardize the preferred bid, from a union that will maintain the style - and jobs - of the St. Gregory. After tracking them down to another hotel, McDermott offers the couple their room back, but when he goes to pick them up, they have already left the hotel. After contacting the NAACP, they inform McDermott that they had not had anything planned (yet) for the St. Gregory in terms of pushing to allow blacks to check into the hotel. The couple then winds up in a Washington newspaper, damaging both O'Keefe's deal and the alternate deal with the union, leaving only the option of selling the hotel to a buyer who plans to destroy it and build an office tower. O'Keefe makes a final offer on the hotel and asks Trent, who brings McDermott along, to hear it. During the meeting, McDermott gets a call revealing that \\"Dr.\\" Elmo Adams is not a doctor after all and actually works as an employee for an O'Keefe Hotel in Philadelphia. McDermott also reveals that O'Keefe offered him $20,000 ($ today) to convince Trent to take the deal, and implies that Rochefort slept with him so that he wouldn't be at the hotel to properly handle the arrival of the black guests. Hotel owner Trent decides to reject the unscrupulous O'Keefe's offer and sell the St. Gregory to the man who will demolish it. Keycase's luck changes when he blithely talks himself out of one tough spot by grabbing an ordinary- looking attache case, which belongs to the Duke and Duchess. He gets to a room, calms his pounding heart, and uses one of his key collection to open the case to see what it contains. The case is filled with the cash to pay off Dupere. Counting himself lucky, Keycase heads for the elevator to leave. In the elevator, Keycase is joined by the Duke and other guests. The elevator stops between floors as the control relays and emergency brakes begin to fail. McDermott and his assistant manager take the adjacent elevator to the same level and transfer passengers through the roof. The Duke and Keycase are the last two in the failing car. Keycase refuses to leave his briefcase, which contains the stolen money. The Duke is able to wrestle the case away and help Keycase out of the car, but right then the brakes completely fail, sending the Duke to his death. The Duchess tells police she was responsible for the auto accident, hoping to save her late husband's reputation. She also saves Dupere by denying that any blackmail had occurred. The police detectives, seeing through the ruse, decide not to press charges. McDermott rounds up the remaining guests, including Jeanne, and buys drinks on the house as a final toast to the St. Gregory.

She was the only woman to receive the death penalty in New Zealand, although several others were sentenced to capital punishment, but had their sentences commuted to either life or long duration imprisonment. Early life Minnie Dean was born in Greenock, in western Scotland. Her father, John McCulloch, was a railway engineer. Her mother, Elizabeth Swan, died of cancer in 1857. It is unknown when she arrived in New Zealand, but by the early 1860s, she was living in Invercargill with two young children. She claimed she was the widow of a Tasmanian doctor, although no evidence of a marriage has been found. She was still using her birth name, McCulloch. In 1872, she married an innkeeper named Charles Dean. The two lived in Etal Creek, then an important stop on the route from Riverton to the Otago goldfields. When the gold rush died down, the couple turned to farming, but were soon in dire financial straits. The family moved to Winton, where Charles Dean took up pig farming. Minnie Dean, meanwhile, began to earn money by taking in unwanted children in exchange for payment. In an era when there were few methods of contraception, and when childbirth outside marriage was frowned upon, there were many women wishing to discreetly send their children away for adoption – as such, Minnie Dean was not short on customers. It is believed that she was responsible for as many as nine young children at any one time. She received payment either weekly or in a lump sum. Infant mortality was a significant problem in New Zealand at this time (as it was estimated to run to about eighty to one hundred infants out of one thousand colonial births).Graham Hutchins: Bad: Crooks, Creeps and Killers in New Zealand Auckland: Hodder Moa: 2010 As such, a number of children under Dean's care died of various illnesses. In March 1889, a six-month-old child had died of convulsions, while in October 1891, a six-week-old baby had perished from cardiovascular and respiratory ailments, while a boy allegedly drowned under her care during 1894. She hid the body in her garden, arousing further suspicions. A coroner's inquest was held, and Dean was not held responsible for the deaths, due to universally poor standards of hygiene, even at childbirth itself. Nevertheless, Dean came to be distrusted by the community, and rumours of mistreatment circulated. Additionally, children under Dean's care allegedly went missing without explanation. In the public's mind, this linked Dean to cases of infanticide or baby farming in the United Kingdom and Australia, where women killed children under their care to avoid having to support them. At the time, lax childcare legislation meant that Dean did not have to keep records of the children she agreed to take in, and so proving that the children had disappeared was difficult. Before Dean's trial and execution, four other women had been tried and sentenced to death - Caroline Whitting (found guilty in 1872), Phoebe Veitch (1883) and Sarah-Jane and Anna Flannagan (1891). In each case, these sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. In each case, child murder was the culpable offence. Thirty years later, in 1926, Daniel Cooper was also convicted of baby farming and also executed for the offence, although Martha, his second wife, was acquitted. In a broader, international context, Dean's misdeeds may also have been viewed in the same light as late Victorian contemporaries and fellow \\"baby farmers\\" such as Amelia Dyer in the United Kingdom (convicted in 1896) and John and Sarah Makin (1893) and Frances Lydia Alice Knorr in New South Wales (1893), as well as previous New Zealand historical instances of ostensibly deliberate child deaths. Certainly, given the proximity of New South Wales, the Makin case featured in New Zealand newspapers during the same period as the Minnie Dean controversy and trial. Murder case and execution In 1895, Dean was observed boarding a train carrying a young baby and a hatbox, but observed leaving the same train without the baby and only the hatbox. As railway porters later testified, the object was suspiciously heavy. A woman, Jane Hornsby, came forward claiming to have given her granddaughter, Eva, to Dean, and clothes identified as belonging to this child were found at Dean's residence, but Dean could not produce the child herself. A search along the railway line found no sign of the child. Dean was arrested and charged with murder. Her garden was dug up, and three bodies (two of babies, and one of a boy estimated to be three years old) were uncovered. An inquest found that one child (Eva) had died of suffocation and one, later identified as one- year-old Dorothy Edith Carter, had died from an overdose of laudanum (used on children to sedate them). The cause of death for the third child was not determined. Dean was charged with their murder. 160px In her trial, Dean's lawyer Alfred Hanlon argued that all deaths were accidental, and that they had been covered up to prevent adverse publicity of the sort that Dean had previously been subjected to. On 21 June 1895, however, Dean was found guilty of Dorothy Carter's murder, and sentenced to death. Between June and August 1895, Dean wrote her own account of her life. Altogether, she claimed to have cared for twenty-eight children. Of these, five were in good health when her establishment was raided, six had died whilst under her care, and one had been reclaimed by her parents. Apart from her two adopted daughters, that left fourteen or so children unaccounted for, according to her own record. On 12 August, she was hanged by the official executioner Tom Long at the Invercargill gaol, at the intersection of Spey and Leven streets, in what is now the Noel Leeming carpark. She is the only woman to have been executed in New Zealand, and as capital punishment in New Zealand has been abolished, it is likely that she will retain that distinction. She is buried in Winton, alongside her husband, who died in a house fire in 1908. Her crimes led to the belated passage of child welfare legislation in New Zealand—the Infant Life Protection Act 1893 and the Infant Protection Act 1896. In popular culture In 1985, Dean's trial was the subject of \\"In Defence of Minnie Dean\\", the first episode of the Emmy-nominated Hanlon New Zealand television drama series about the career of Dean's lawyer. The episode won the Best Director, Best Drama Programme, Drama Script, and Performance, Female, in a Dramatic Role categories at the 1986 Listener Television Awards (also called the GOFTA Awards), and \\"contributed to a re-evaluation of Dean's conviction\\". Minnie Dean is referenced in Dudley Benson's 2006 song \\"It's Akaroa's Fault\\" (\\"I don't want to meet Minnie Dean at the end of my life/If I were to meet her I'd keep her hatbox in sight\\"). Authors Lynley Hood and John Rawle wrote posthumous accounts and reconstructions of the case as the centenary of her apprehension and execution occurred, in 1995. On Friday 30 January 2009 the Otago Daily Times reported that a headstone had appeared mysteriously on Dean's grave. The headstone reads \\"Minnie Dean is part of Winton's history Where she now lies is now no mystery\\". It is unknown who placed the headstone there. Her family had been considering it but claim that this was not their doing. The Southland Times reported on 23 February 2009 that the family laid a headstone to honour Dean and her husband's grave. At the 2012 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, a play titled \\"A Cry Too Far From Heaven\\" was performed by a Southland (NZ) theatre company and featured Minnie Dean as one of the title characters on her last night before execution. In 2013, the New Zealand musician Marlon Williams wrote a song inspired by Minnie's case, entitled \\"Ballad of Minnie Dean\\".

Ulmer and starring Boris Karloff and Béla Lugosi. The picture was the first of eight films (six of which were produced by Universal) to feature the two iconic actors. It became Universal Pictures' biggest box office hit of the year, and was among the earlier movies with an almost continuous music score. Lugosi also appeared in the 1941 film with the same title. The film helped to create and popularize the psychological horror subgenre, emphasizing on atmosphere, eerie sounds, the darker side of the human psyche, and emotions like fear and guilt to deliver its scares, something that was not used in the horror genre. Plot Newlyweds Peter (David Manners) and Joan Alison (Julie Bishop), on their honeymoon in Hungary, learn that due to a mixup, they must share a train compartment with Dr. Vitus Werdegast (Béla Lugosi), a Hungarian psychiatrist. Eighteen years before, Werdegast went to World War I, never seeing his wife again. He has spent the last 15 years in an infamous prison camp in Siberia. On the train, the doctor explains that he is traveling to see an old friend, Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff), an Austrian architect. Later, the doctor, Peter, and Joan, share a bus, which crashes on a desolate, rain- swept road. Joan is injured, and the doctor and Peter take her to Poelzig's home, built upon the ruins of Fort Marmorus, which Poelzig commanded during the war. Werdegast treats Joan's injury, administering the tranquilizing drug hyoscine, causing her to behave erratically. While Peter puts her to bed, Werdegast accuses Poelzig of betraying the fort during the war to the Russians, resulting in the death of thousands of Austro-Hungarian soldiers. He also accuses Poelzig of stealing his wife Karen while he was in prison. Previously, Werdegast killed Poelzig's black cat, and Poelzig explains that Werdegast has a strong fear of the animals. Poelzig carries a second black cat around the house with him while he oversees his \\"collection\\" of dead women on display in glass cases, including Karen. Poelzig plans to sacrifice Joan in a satanic ritual during the dark of the moon. Poelzig had married Werdegast's wife, and when she died, he married his daughter (who was told her real father died in prison). He is seen reading a book called The Rites of Lucifer while a beautiful blonde woman (Lucille Lund) sleeps next to him. The blonde is Werdegast's daughter – thus, Poelzig's stepdaughter – also named Karen. Werdegast, who is unaware of his daughter's presence, bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike the mad architect. He also tries to persuade his foe to spare Peter and Joan, at one point literally gambling with their lives by playing a game of chess with Poelzig, which he loses. This moment comes during the beginning of the satanists' service, when a female acolyte sees something which causes her to scream and faint. Werdegast and his servant Thamal (Harry Cording) snatch Joan from the sacrificial altar and carry her into the catacombs beneath the house, where Peter is rendered unconscious by Poelzig's servant. Joan tells Werdegast his daughter is alive in the building somewhere. He discovers that Poelzig has killed his daughter, and in an insane rage, shackles him to an embalming rack, where he proceeds to literally skin Poelzig alive. Joan tries to tear a key from the dead hand of Poelzig's servant, and Peter, regaining consciousness, mistakes Werdegast's attempt to help her as an attack and shoots him. Fatally wounded, Werdegast blows up the house, first letting the couple escape but with Poelzig's \\"rotten cult\\" still upstairs. \\"It has been a good game\\", he says before he dies. Cast Cast notes * Lund also plays the elder Karen Werdegast. Production The Black Cat was the biggest box-office hit of the year for Universal and was the first of eight movies (six of which were produced by Universal) to pair actors Béla Lugosi and Boris Karloff. Director Edgar G. Ulmer's film was part of a boom in horror sound films following the release of Dracula and Frankenstein in 1931. The film has little to do with Edgar Allan Poe's 1843 short story \\"The Black Cat\\", though Poe's name is listed in the credits. The film exploited a sudden public interest in psychiatry.Neimeyer, Mark. \\"Poe and popular culture\\" as collected in The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe, Kevin J. Hayes, editor. Cambridge University Press, 2002. pp. 216-7 Peter Ruric (better known as pulp writer \\"Paul Cain\\") wrote the screenplay. The classical music soundtrack, compiled by Heinz Eric Roemheld (composed of pieces from Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Chopin and others) occupies nearly 80% of the film. The movie bears no relation to the 1941 The Black Cat, starring Basil Rathbone, except for the presence of Lugosi in both pictures. The film was released in UK cinemas under the title House of Doom. The film – and by extension, the character of Hjalmar Poelzig – draws inspiration from the life of occultist Aleister Crowley. The name Poelzig was borrowed from architect Hans Poelzig, whom Ulmer claimed to have worked with on the sets for Paul Wegener's silent film The Golem. Release The film was released on DVD as part of the Bela Lugosi Collection in 2005 along with Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Raven, The Invisible Ray, and Black Friday. On 20 July 2020, Eureka Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray as part of their Masters of Cinema collection in their Three Edgar Allan Poe Adaptations Starring Bela Lugosi set which also included Murders in the Rue Morgue and The Raven. Critical reception Alternate theatrical release poster Upon the film's original 1934 release, The New York Times reviewer wrote: \\"The Black Cat is more foolish than horrible. The story and dialogue pile the agony on too thick to give the audience a reasonable scare.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating from critics of 87%. It was also ranked #68 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments for its \\"skinning\\" scene. (\\"Karloff gets skinned alive at the end\\", noted Cramps guitarist and horror aficionado Poison Ivy, \\"but they show the shadow of it and somehow that's more gruesome.\\") The British critic Philip French called it \\"the first (and best) of seven Karloff/Lugosi joint appearances. The movie unfolds like a nightmare that involves necrophilia, ailurophobia, drugs, a deadly game of chess, torture, flaying, and a black mass with a human sacrifice. This bizarre, utterly irrational masterpiece, lasting little more than an hour, has images that bury themselves in the mind.\\"Philip French's DVD club, No 92, The Observer 4 November 2007 In the 2010s, Time Out polled authors, directors, actors and critics who had worked in the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Time Out placed The Black Cat at number 89 on the top 100.

The film takes place in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, during the summer of 1973. Its primary focus is a young girl, Troy (played by Zelda Harris), and her family. Throughout the film, Troy learns life lessons through her four rowdy brothers, her loving but strict mother (Alfre Woodard), and her naive, struggling father (Delroy Lindo). A distinctive characteristic of Crooklyn is its soundtrack, composed completely of music from the 1970s, except the hit single \\"Crooklyn\\" by the Crooklyn Dodgers, a rap crew composed of Buckshot, Masta Ace, and Special Ed. A two-volume release of the soundtrack became available on CD along with the release of the film. Similarly to School Daze, Do the Right Thing, and She's Gotta Have It, Spike Lee appears in Crooklyn. He plays a young glue huffer named Snuffy, who likes to bully the local children. Crooklyn is the second of only two films directed by Spike Lee to earn a PG-13 rating in the USA, a distinction it shares with Malcolm X. New Yorkers selected the film for simultaneous screenings across New York City as part of the 2017 One Film, One New York contest. Plot In 1973, nine-year-old Troy Carmichael and her brothers Clinton, Wendell, Nate, and Joseph live in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The children live with their parents, Woody, a struggling musician, and Carolyn, a schoolteacher. Some of the impacting neighbors of this film are Jesse and Jose. The neighborhood is filled with colorful characters. The Carmichaels' next-door neighbor, Tony Eyes, continuously sings and plays his electric keyboard. Snuffy and Right Hand Man are glue sniffers. Vic Powell is a war vet who lives upstairs from the Carmichaels. One day, the Carmichael children get into a dispute with Tony who alleges that they are always throwing trash into his area. The argument escalates when Carolyn and several neighborhood children get involved. Tony is still yelling when Vic comes downstairs. Vic then punches Tony in the face. Troy, who has sneaked out to the corner store, sees Vic getting arrested as she leaves the store. One night, Woody and Carolyn argue about money; Carolyn resents Woody because he is not appreciating their financial situation and uses their money carelessly to fund his solo career. The argument escalates as Carolyn yells for the children to turn off the television. Carolyn later turns off the TV. Clinton turns his back on Carolyn and she grabs him for disobeying. Woody then grabs her and carries her out of the room. Woody carries Carolyn out of the room and down the stairs and Nate jumps on Woody's back. The other children hold Carolyn and Carolyn hurts her ankle in the struggle. Carolyn kicks Woody out of the house. Woody brings flowers to Carolyn and the two reconcile. The family then decides to go on a trip. As they are leaving, a worker from Con Ed comes by to shut off the electricity due to an unpaid bill. The trip is postponed and the family has to use candles for light. A few days later the family travels to the South to stay with affluent relatives. Troy stays with her cousin, Viola, who was adopted by Uncle Clem and Aunt Song. Troy has fun with Viola despite a dislike of her snobby Aunt Song and her dog, Queenie. On Troy's tenth birthday, she gets a letter from Carolyn. After reading the letter and dealing with constant bickering between Viola and Aunt Song, Troy decides she wants to go home. When Troy returns to New York, she is picked up at the airport by Aunt Maxine and Uncle Brown. Troy later learns her mother is in the hospital and is taken to see her. Later that evening, Woody tells the kids that their mother has cancer and must stay in the hospital. The boys cry, but Troy remains stoic. Troy then begins filling in the mother role while Carolyn remains in the hospital but later dies from her battle with cancer. In the next scene, one of Troy's brothers wonder if they have to dress up for their mother's funeral. The day of the funeral, Troy is approached by her Aunt Maxine who tries to coax her into trying on the new clothes she's brought telling her it would make Carolyn proud. Troy calmly explains that her mother hates polyester and would never let her wear it then announces to Woody that she is not going to the funeral. After Woody explains that Carolyn would want them all together at church, Troy agrees to go. At the house gathering after the funeral, Troy is withdrawn. Joseph comes inside crying, saying that Snuffy and Right Hand Man robbed him. Following her mother's wishes to protect her younger brother, Troy goes outside with a baseball bat and hits Snuffy, telling him to go sniff glue on his own block. Early the next morning, Troy dreams she's hearing her mother's voice. She goes downstairs to see her father trying to kill a rat in the kitchen. Woody then tells her that it is all right to cry, saying that even Clinton has cried. Troy concludes that it is good that her mother is no longer suffering. In the epilogue, the Carmichael family and their friends carry on with their lives as the summer draws to a close. Troy assumes the matriarch role that Carolyn left behind. Carolyn's spirit continues to visit Troy, praising her for taking on such responsibilities. Cast Development and production Spike Lee was signed to a multiyear deal with Universal Studios, giving them the first look at buying any of his films, and in March 1993 they approved production for Crooklyn, which would be the first one made under this deal. Lee co-wrote the script with two of his siblings, basing the story of the mother's illness on their own life experience. Zelda Harris was cast for the role of Troy through an open audition process. For the music in the film, Lee picked all the songs himself, choosing ones from his childhood. The filming took place on location in New York, including Fort Greene Park. During the scenes of the film that take place in the South, the shots were filmed with an anamorphic lens in such a way to give a squeezed appearance, illustrating the alienated feelings Troy was having in a place very strange to her. During the original run of the film, audience members were confused by these squeezed images, assuming there was some kind of technical error, so the studio put up signs in the theaters to explain the effect was intentional. Release and reception Crooklyn premiered at the San Francisco International Film Festival on May 12, 1994. It was released to theaters in May 1994, and debuted at number three at the box office. As of October 2019, Crooklyn holds a rating of 77% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \\"A personal project that warmly reflects on Spike Lee's childhood, Crooklyn is an episodic celebration of family and the inedible facets of one's hometown\\". When the film was released, Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote, \\"Messy as the semiautobiographical Crooklyn often is, it succeeds in becoming a touching and generous family portrait, a film that exposes welcome new aspects of this director's talent.\\" Variety's Todd McCarthy called the film \\"both annoying and vibrant, casually plotted and deeply personal,\\" adding that it \\"ends up being as compelling as it is messy\\". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars, stating, \\"Lee's wonderful opening title sequence shows the children's street games that flourished in Brooklyn in the 1970s. Today, he says, those games have died, and he had to teach them to the actors who played the children. They have died because the kids in comparable neighborhoods today are afraid to go outside and play in the streets. Crooklyn is not in any way an angry film. But thinking about the difference between its world and ours can make you angry, and I think that was one of Lee's purposes here.\\" In a 2018 Variety article looking back on Lee's filmography, Joe Leydon ranked Crooklyn at ninth place: \\"At once street smart and sweetly sentimental, this warmly nostalgic coming-of-age drama could be described as a Spike Lee movie for people who normally dislike Spike Lee movies.\\"  Year-end lists  * Honorable mention – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph * Honorable mention – Dennis King, Tulsa World * Honorable mention – Duane Dudek, Milwaukee Sentinel * 10th worst – John Hurley, Staten Island Advance Legacy New Yorkers selected the film for free, simultaneous screenings across all five New York City boroughs as part of the 2017 One Film, One New York contest.

The museum was founded in the Dorobanți neighbourhood in 1947, closed by the Ceauşescu regime in 1977, and re-opened in 1992. It is now a branch of The National Museum of Art of Romania. Its collection includes works by Romanian artists--including a masterful portrait of Zambaccian himself by Corneliu Baba--and works by several French impressionists. It is located not far from Piaţa Dorobanţilor on a street now renamed after Zambaccian. At the time the museum was founded, the act of donation stated that it must be housed in Zambaccian's former home. However, after the 1977 Bucharest earthquake (which did no detectable damage to the museum building), the Romanian government created the Museum of Art Collections, consolidating many of the city's smaller museums (and a good number of expropriated private collections). The Zambaccian collection still resided at the Museum of Art Collections at the time of the Romanian Revolution of 1989; it was returned to its historic location in 1992.

Under Haas' ownership, the Athletics won five American League West Division titles (the first in 1981 and the last in 1992, advancing to three consecutive World Series between 1988 and 1990, defeating the cross-bay rival San Francisco Giants in 1989 in a sweep marred only by the infamous Loma Prieta earthquake). Philanthropy Haas sought to strengthen Levi Strauss & Co.’s position as a socially responsible international corporation. During the 1950s, Haas, along with his brother, Peter E. Haas, oversaw racial integration of the company’s plants. He also led the creation of Community Involvement Teams for Levi Strauss & Co. employees. Haas served on the boards of the Ford Foundation and the National Park Foundation while leading Levi Strauss & Co. He was also involved in other nonprofit institutions such as the Hunter’s Point Boys’ Club and the San Francisco Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund. Together with his wife, Haas established the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund in 1953 as a private family foundation. As its mission statement describes, the Fund “seeks to fulfill (its) founders’ vision of a just and caring society that provides fundamental rights and opportunities so that all people can live, work and raise their families with dignity.” Of his family’s philanthropy, Haas used to say, \\"It's in the genes.\\" Personal life In 1940, Haas married Evelyn Danzig Haas; they had three children: Robert D. Haas, former chairman and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co.; philanthropist Betsy Haas Eisenhardt who is married to Roy Eisenhardt; and Walter J. Haas, co-chairman of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund and former chairman and CEO of the Oakland Athletics.San Francisco Gate: \\"Philanthropist, arts patron Evelyn Haas dies\\" by Michael Cabanatuan February 4, 2010 Haas died at age 79 from prostate cancer at his San Francisco residence.

Dworkin was also featured as a major character in a prequel series of four books written by John Gregory Betancourt. Fictional biography =Early life in Chaos and Shadow= Dworkin was born into House Barimen, a noble family in the Courts of Chaos. His usual appearance was that of a dwarf, although like many Lords of Chaos, he was able to change his shape. After obtaining the Left Eye of the Serpent of Chaos (which would later be known as the Jewel of Judgment) through methods unknown, he fled into Shadow and met the Unicorn of Order. With her help and using the Eye, he inscribed the Primal Pattern, giving form to Amber. =Residence in Amber= Early in Amber's history, Dworkin served in the court of his son, King Oberon, as an advisor and teacher of magical skills, including the power of creating Trumps. He was frequently absent from Amber, in places unknown. His students included many or most of Oberon's children, including Bleys, Brand, and Fiona, who received advanced instruction. Prior to the beginning of The Chronicles of Amber, Dworkin went mad, apparently because of damage to the Primal Pattern, which was linked to and reflected in his own mind. =Role in the Amber stories= Prince Corwin, Oberon's son and the protagonist of the first five books of The Chronicles of Amber, learns that Dworkin had been imprisoned by Oberon for several centuries. Oberon had deemed Dworkin to be dangerous and unstable, after Dworkin privately proposed that the Pattern should be destroyed. This would clear the way to create a new and undamaged Pattern, but would also result in the destruction of Amber and all of the alternate realities it cast as Shadows. Dworkin proves to be capable of leaving his prison at will, during lucid periods of temporary improvement in his madness. He voluntarily returns and confines himself when he feels madness coming upon him again. After Corwin is imprisoned for five years in the dungeons below Amber's castle, Dworkin helps Corwin escape by drawing a Trump depicting the Lighthouse of Cabra on the wall of Corwin's cell. Children Oberon, the first king of Amber, was Dworkin's son. By some accounts, the Unicorn gave birth to Oberon. In The Chronicles of Amber, no other children of Dworkin were mentioned. However, in the Dawn of Amber prequel series (a set of four authorized Amber novels written by John Gregory Betancourt), many more children of Dworkin were introduced: :Sons: :*Oberon :*Locke, whose mother was Valeria Ryassa de Lyor ab Sytalla, Lady of Chaos :*Daren :*Titus and Conner, twin brothers :*Fenn :*Aber :*Mattus :*Taine :*Alanar :*two unnamed sons who went missing and were presumed dead :Daughters: :*Freda :*Pella :*Blaise :*Isadora :*Syara :*Leona :*two unnamed daughters who went missing and were presumed dead In popular culture Computer programmer Felix Croes uses \\"Dworkin\\" as a pseudonym, referring to Dworkin Barimen, and named his MUD software platform Dworkin's Game Driver.

The Iliupersis (Greek: , Iliou persis, \\"Sack of Ilium\\"), also known as The Sack of Troy, is a lost epic of ancient Greek literature. It was one of the Epic Cycle, that is, the Trojan cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The story of the Iliou persis comes chronologically after that of the Little Iliad, and is followed by the Nostoi (\\"Returns\\"). The Iliou persis was sometimes attributed by ancient writers to Arctinus of Miletus (8th century BCE) (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised two books of verse in dactylic hexameter. Date The Iliou persis was probably composed in the seventh century BCE, but there is much uncertainty. Ancient sources date Arctinus to the eighth century BCE, but evidence concerning another of his poems, the Aethiopis, suggests that he lived considerably later than that. Content Only ten lines of the original text of the Iliou persis survive. For its storyline we are almost entirely dependent on a summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the Chrestomathy written by an unknown Proclus (possibly to be identified with the 2nd century CE grammarian Eutychius Proclus). A few other references give indications of the poem's storyline. A further impression of the poem's content may be gained from book 2 of Virgil's Aeneid (written many centuries after the Iliou persis), which tells the story from a Trojan point of view. Note that different sources record some details differently: for example the manner of Aeneas' departure from Troy, or the identity of Astyanax's killer. The version told here specifically follows what is known of the early epic poem, rather than any other source. The poem opens with the Trojans discussing what to do with the wooden horse which the Greeks have left behind: some thought they ought to hurl it down from the rocks, others to burn it up, while others say they ought to dedicate it to Athena. The third opinion prevails, and the Trojans celebrate their apparent victory. The god Poseidon, meanwhile, sends an ill omen of two snakes which kill Laocoön and one of his two sons; seeing this, Aeneas and his men leave Troy in anticipation of what is to come. When night comes, signalled by Sinon, the Greek warriors inside the horse emerge and open the city gates to let in the Greek army, having sailed back from Tenedos. The Trojans are massacred, and the Greeks set fire to the city. Neoptolemus kills king Priam, even though he has taken refuge at the altar of Zeus; Menelaus kills Deiphobus and takes back his wife Helen; Ajax the Lesser wrests Cassandra from the altar of Athena, incurring physical damage to the idol. The Greeks determine that they should stone Ajax in retribution, but he in turn also takes refuge at the altar of Athena. Odysseus kills Hector's baby son Astyanax and Neoptolemus takes Hector's wife Andromache captive. The Greeks make a human sacrifice of Priam's daughter Polyxena at Achilles's tomb. Athena formulates a plan to inflict revenge upon the Greeks concurrent with their nautical return. Editions *Online editions (English translation): **Fragments of the Iliou persis translated by H.G.

Cloakrooms are typically found inside large buildings, such as gymnasiums, schools, churches or meeting halls. In smaller buildings, people may hang their own coats, but in large buildings or complexes, coatcheck attendants may take the coats. In some venues, such as nightclubs, using the cloakroom's coat check service is mandatory. The name comes from the French word cloque, meaning \\"traveling cloak\\". In the UK, a cloakroom may also refer to a lavatory. Attendants The cloakroom of the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle in Germany Attended cloakrooms, or coat checks, are staffed rooms where coats and bags can be stored securely. Typically, a ticket or receipt is given to the customer, with a corresponding ticket attached to the garment or item. Coat checks are often found at the entrances to nightclubs, theaters, concert halls, larger restaurants, or museums. A fee may be charged, or a tip may be paid by the customer when they reclaim their item. Some coat checks post signs proclaiming any fees or tips, especially when their use is mandatory (as in many museums). US Congress The United States Congress \\"cloakrooms\\" are locations where members of Congress may interact outside the formal meeting rooms, and are used by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The cloakrooms serve as a place for members to socialize, eat, and take naps without leaving the building.C-SPAN's Capitol Questions. These rooms are closed to all except for Senators, Representatives, Senate Pages, and a few of their trusted staffers, and may even have their own private phone numbers. India In India, cloak rooms are available in all major railway stations, where railway passengers can keep their luggage for a specific amount of time. Some of the bigger stations have 24-hour manned facilities, while the smaller ones operate only early morning to evening. This often suits day traders or pilgrims coming from smaller towns to larger cities and people waiting for a changeover to another train. Cloak rooms enable passengers to avoid carrying their luggage through the city while they conduct their business or tourism. The facilities are operated by the Commercial Department of Indian Railways at all major railway stations; smaller railway stations may not have this facility. A clerk collects the luggage from the passengers alighting from a train at that station or passengers having a train from that station, after verifying their tickets. The locked luggage bags are collected and a receipt is issued, mentioning the date and time the luggage was surrendered. The items are then stored on racks in the cloak room. Passengers are advised not to store valuable items or personal effects in the bags. On return, passengers show their receipt, pay the necessary charges to the clerk, and collect their items.Cloak Room in Indian Railways Apart from the availability of cloakrooms in major railway stations, cloakrooms are present in airports in major cities in the form of a left luggage facility. The left luggage facility is present in one of the terminals of the airport (usually the terminal used for international travel). The prices of storing luggage varies according to size of the luggage and the number of hours. Prices are more expensive as compared to those at railway stations. One would require a copy of their boarding pass and a valid ID proof to store their luggage.

It is technically located in East Denver which begins immediately east of Broadway, the neighborhood's western boundary. Many consider the Cheesman Park neighborhood to be a part of the Capitol Hill neighborhood, but as defined by the city , Cheesman Park is a separate neighborhood. Denver also recognizes a statistical neighborhood called North Capitol Hill, also known as Uptown by some residents. Colfax Avenue is the border between these two neighborhoods. History The neighborhood was originally the home of Denver's elite who constructed elaborate mansions. As the economy of Denver slumped after the Silver Crash of 1893, construction in Capitol Hill concentrated on apartments. Three buildings still in existence are examples of the architecture of this time: The Colonnade, Alta Court (currently an office building), and the Hamilton. This cultural and demographic shift, from single-family mansions toward boarding houses and rental property for the transient middle class, marked a shift toward the present multi-family dominance of the neighborhood. Capitol Hill remained a solid middle-class neighborhood until after World War II, when middle-class families left Capitol Hill. The demographics of people left behind were transients and renters. Another watershed in the history of Capitol hill was the completion of Interstate 70. No longer did incoming tourists drive down East Colfax Avenue on their way into downtown. The tourist dollar was effectively wiped out as a revenue source for East Colfax after this decade. So began another downward spiral. With no tourists to spend money along East Colfax the businesses suffered, as did the demand to go to Capitol Hill. The affordability, urban character and eclectic architecture made the area appealing to young bohemians, artists, musicians (Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg were former neighborhood residents) which has led to a gradual gentrification that reached its height during the 2000s. The rents in the neighborhood have increased significantly over the past decade, and many of the cheap apartments in the area have been converted into more expensive condominiums. Nonetheless the neighborhood has an older housing stock which lacks off-street parking, contributing to a relative affordability compared to other central neighborhoods. Currently many portions of East Colfax Avenue are undergoing redevelopment to make them denser and more pedestrian-friendly. Despite these redevelopment efforts, a brief stroll along Colfax Avenue through the Capitol Hill neighborhood will provide a glimpse of its history. In 2012 the state history museum of Colorado, the History Colorado Center, was opened next to the new Colorado State Judiciary building.http://www.denverpost.com/ci_22173071/colorado-judicial-center- designed-be-welcoming-opens-next-week Geography Capitol Hill highlighted on this map of Denver's neighborhoods. The neighborhood is located just southeast of Denver's Central Business District (CBD) in a well-established residential neighborhood, with commercial centers located along major traffic routes (such as Colfax Avenue and Broadway) and interior arterials (such as East 13th and 14th Avenues). The neighborhood is directly east of the Civic Center neighborhood and the Colorado State Capitol. Over 95% of this neighborhood is developed. The average year of construction for buildings is 1920, with some of the oldest single-family homes in the city. The characteristics of Capitol Hill are closely related to other east Denver neighborhoods, which include the hospital district and the North Capitol Hill neighborhood. Public transportation and city support services are readily available. Neighborhood Boundaries: *North – Colfax Avenue *South – Seventh Avenue *East – Downing Street *West – Broadway Characteristics Capitol Hill is Denver's most densely populated neighborhood. It was once the home of Denver's elite and origination of Foursquare architecture in Denver. Today it consists of historic mansions, apartments and condo buildings. Because of the concentration of multi-family uses and the urban character of the neighborhood, parking is at a premium. The area is strongly influenced by the Colorado State Capitol, which is within its boundaries, and Downtown Denver which is adjacent to the northwest boundary of the neighborhood. Commercial uses are typically located on major arterials such as Colfax Avenue, East 8th Avenue, East 14th Avenue, East 13th Avenue, Lincoln Street and Broadway. A considerable number of mansion properties have been converted to office uses over the past several years due to zoning exemptions offered to historic structures which are zoned for residential uses. Office development in the neighborhood is primarily concentrated in the northwest portion of the neighborhood with small professional offices located throughout the neighborhood. Arts and culture The Capitol Hill neighborhood is influenced by its proximity to the Colorado State Capitol, Downtown and its northern boundary, East Colfax Avenue. Capitol Hill is one of the most cosmopolitan neighborhoods in Denver, well known as a haven for artists and bohemians. There are numerous restaurants, clubs, bars, stores, concert venues, and other cultural amenities in the community. East 13th Avenue is the center of Denver's punk community with various stores that cater to punks and hipsters. Colfax Avenue has a reputation for a wild nightlife with multiple concert venues (The Fillmore Auditorium, The Ogden Theater, The Bluebird Theater, 1Up Colfax), and numerous late-night bars, coffeeshops, restaurants, and stores on the street. During the day, lobbyists and politicians from the Colorado State Capitol can be seen making deals in the restaurants and bars of the neighborhood. The neighborhood also has a reputation for being a very gay and lesbian friendly area of Denver. Capitol Hill is next to two major Denver parks, Civic Center Park and Cheesman Park. Both of these are meeting centers for the community; they host many festivals, including the Capitol Hill United Neighborhoods-sponsored People's Fair in early June. Capitol Hill has had a long bohemian reputation with the Colburn Hotel on Grant Street being a onetime residence of Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. =Attractions= *Colorado State Capitol *Cathedral of St. John in the Wilderness *Molly Brown House – now a museum *Quizno's subs – the first location of the chain *Wax Trax!

Recently drug sales have decreased in the neighborhood as policing initiatives brought down the crime rate and hastened the ongoing gentrification. The crime rate in 2014 in the Capitol Hill neighborhood was 8.63 incidents per 1,000 residents, one of the worst violent crime rates in Denver.

Life Dominique Lapierre was born in Châtelaillon-Plage, Charente-Maritime, France. At the age of thirteen, he travelled to America with his father who was a diplomat (Consul General of France). He attended the Jesuit school in New Orleans and became a paper boy for the New Orleans Item. He developed interests in travelling, writing and cars. Lapierre renovated a 1927 Nash that his mother gave him and decided to travel across America during his summer holidays. To earn his way he painted mail boxes. Later, he received a scholarship to study the Aztec civilization in Mexico. He hitch-hiked throughout America living an adventurous existence, wrote articles, washed windows in churches, gave lectures, and even found a job as a siren cleaner on a boat returning to Europe. One day a truck driver who picked him up on the road to Chicago stole his suitcase. He found the driver before the police did. The Chicago Tribune paid him $100 for his exclusive story. His twenty thousand miles of adventure beginning with just thirty dollars in his pocket led to his first book A Dollar for a Thousand kilometers. It became one of the best sellers of postwar France and other European countries. Early works When Lapierre was eighteen, he received a Fulbright Scholarship to study economics at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. He bought a 1937 Chrysler convertible for $30 and fell in love with a fashion editor. They were married in New York City Hall on his 21st birthday and drove to Mexico in the old Chrysler for their honeymoon. With only $300 in their pockets, they had just enough to buy gas, sandwiches, and cheap rooms in truckers’ motels. In Los Angeles, they won another $300 in a radio game show for Campbell Soup. The prize included a case of soup, which was their only food for three weeks. Lapierre sold the Chrysler for $400 in San Francisco and bought two tickets on the SS Presidential Cleveland for Japan. The honeymoon lasted for a year. They worked their way across Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and Lebanon. When they returned to France, Lapierre wrote his second book, Honeymoon around the Earth. Collaboration with Larry Collins On his return to Paris after his honeymoon, he was conscripted into the French army. After one year in the tank regiment, he was transferred to the SHAPE headquarters to serve as an interpreter. One day in the cafeteria he met a young American corporal, Larry Collins, a Yale graduate and draftee. They became friends instantly. When Collins was discharged he was offered a job with Procter & Gamble. Two days before reporting to the new job, the United Press offered him a job as caption writer at their Paris office, for much less money than offered by Procter & Gamble. Collins took the offer from United Press and was soon picked up by Newsweek to be their correspondent in the Middle East. When Lapierre was discharged, he found work as a reporter for the magazine Paris Match. Collins became the godfather of the Lapierres' first child, Alexandra. On several occasions, Collins and Lapierre met while on assignment. In spite of their friendship they had to compete with each other for stories. But they decided to join forces to tell a big story which would appeal to both French and anglophone audiences. Their first bestseller Is Paris Burning? sold close to ten million copies in thirty languages. In this book they mixed the modern technique of investigation journalism with the classical methods of historical research. After that they spent four years in Jerusalem to reconstruct the birth of the State of Israel for the book O Jerusalem!. Lapierre is proud that after spending a great deal of time in Jerusalem he knows each alley, square, street, and building in the Holy City intimately. Two of Lapierre's books – Is Paris Burning? (co-written with Larry Collins) and City of Joy – have been made into films. Lapierre and Collins wrote several other books together, the last being Is New York Burning? (2005), before Collins' death in 2005. Lapierre speaks fluent Bengali. City of Joy Foundation and other humanitarian causes The City of Joy is about the unsung heroes of the Pilkhana slum in Kolkata. Lapierre donated half the royalties he earned from this book to support several humanitarian projects in Kolkata, including refuge centres for leper and polio children, dispensaries, schools, rehabilitation workshops, education programs, sanitary actions, and hospital boats. To process and channel the charitable funds he founded an association called Action aid for Calcutta lepers' children (registered in France under the official name of Action pour les enfants des lépreux de Calcutta). Aware of the corruption in India, he organizes all his fund transfers to India in such a way as to ensure that the money reaches the right person for the right purpose. His wife since 1980, Dominique Conchon-Lapierre is his partner in the City of Joy Foundation. The royalties from Five Past Midnight in Bhopal go to the Sambhavna clinic in Bhopal which provides free medical treatment to the victims of the 1984 Union Carbide Bhopal disaster. Lapierre also funds a primary school in Oriya Basti, one of the settlements described in Five Past Midnight in Bhopal. Passion for cars and travelling At the age of six, he developed a passion for automobiles. Each summer, while at his grandparents' Atlantic coast beach house, he marvelled at the wonders of his uncle's American cars. When he was a Fulbright exchange student at Lafayette College, he bought, for thirty dollars, a convertible Chrysler Royal he found in a junkyard. Forty-five years later, he saw a photograph of the same Chrysler in a French vintage car magazine. The automobile was about to be auctioned in Poitiers. He rushed to the auction, made a bid, and won it. When he was a student at the University of Paris, he acquired an old Amil car, which he and a classmate drove all the way to Ankara, Turkey. He has told stories about how he drove the car in reverse to have enough torque to get through the mountain passes. Later, in a Rolls-Royce he bought on his fortieth birthday, he drove from Bombay to Saint Tropez via Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey. Awards He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's fourth highest civilian award in the 2008 Republic Day honours list.

Economically, it reinvented itself from a manufacturing base into a financial centre. Background Hong Kong, 1970s Political talks about the Second Convention of Peking resurfaced in the early 70s. The New Territories land lease agreement would end within 27 years in 1997. MacLehose began visiting Beijing to talk about the future of Hong Kong with PRC leaders. The British and the PRC governments began a long negotiation process that would ultimately lead to the Handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Political and social development Under Sir Murray MacLehose, 25th Governor of Hong Kong (1971–82), a series of reforms improved public services, the environment, housing, welfare, education and infrastructure. MacLehose was the longest- serving governor and, by the end of his tenure, had become one of the most popular and well-known figures in the Crown Colony. MacLehose laid the foundation for Hong Kong to establish itself as a global city in the 1980s and early 1990s. A number of MacLehose's most significant policies included: * Nine years of compulsory, free education for school-aged children * ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)) in 1974: eradicated corruption in public bodies, police force, firefighters and business corporations, which led to Hong Kong being regarded as one of the least corrupt cities during the 1990s * the Ten Years Housing Scheme, designed to end squatting and slums and provide ample housing for expansion.James Lee and Yip Ngai-ming, \\"Public Housing and Family Life in East Asia: Housing History and Social Change in Hong Kong, 1953-1990,\\" Journal of Family History (2006) 31#1 pp. 66–82James Lee, Housing, Home Ownership and Social Change in Hong Kong (1999) * Social welfare protection: Jobseekers' Allowance, Elderly Allowance, Disability Allowance, etc. * Overhaul of the healthcare system and construction of Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital * Adoption of Chinese, along with English, as an official language of British Hong Kong * Development of new towns, Sha Tin and Tuen Mun * Establishment of country parks to preserve 70% of Hong Kong's green landmass With the rising public service provision came a clampdown on the free flow of refugees from mainland China that had powered the growth of Hong Kong since the Second World War. In 1974, the 'touch base' was introduced, under which only those immigrant arrivals who reached the urban areas were allowed to stay. Six years later, it was replaced by a policy of repatriation for all illegal arrivals.Understanding of history must teach Hongkongers – and mainlanders – the need for tolerance, by Peter Kammerer, SCMP, 23 November 2015 Culture =Metrication= The Metric System was adopted under the 1976 Metrication Ordinance. Subsequently, many of the wet markets and traditional Chinese medicine shops used the old Chinese system for at least another decade. =Education= The Hong Kong government introduced six years of free compulsory education in 1971, and expanded it to nine years in 1978.Eh Net. \\"Eh Net .\\" Hong Kong History. Retrieved 21 February 2007. Companies were also seeking well educated employees for complex projects. Seventy-two percent of overseas graduates between 1962 and 1976 would come back to Hong Kong to take on highly skilled domestic positions.Koo, Ramsey. Bray Mark. [2005] (2005) Education And Society in Hong Kong And Macao: Comparative Perspectives on Continuity and Change. Springer Publishing. =Domestic entertainment= On 7 September 1975, Commercial Television was established. It provided competition for the other two other companies: Rediffusion Television and Television Broadcasts Limited. Unable to compete, Commercial TV closed down on 22 August 1978 after only three years of operation. The 1970s was when Hong Kong gained daily news broadcasts. News programmes ranked in the top 10 continuously for a decade. Other segments of the ratings included TV dramas, which averaged 80 to 120 episodes, usually broadcasting at 7:00 pm. 66% of the population tuned in regularly covering 2 to 3 million viewers nightly. Popular series finales would empty streets and restaurants. Most series did not contain much if any Chinese traditionalism.Ma, Eric Kit-wai. Ma, Chieh-Wei. [1999] (1999). Culture, Politics, and Television in Hong Kong. United Kingdom: Routledge. The theme songs of these dramas also helped revive Cantonese music - indeed the term Cantopop was coined during this period. =Foreign entertainment= Hong Kong also found itself at a unique geographical and cultural crossroads. Many of the western artists like Elvis Presley and The Beatles were getting exposure in the music industry. Toys from Japan have arrived in Hong Kong via random and inconsistent shipments in the past. But the first big waves of Japanese products with staying power in the market place were mainly super robot toys. Gordian Warrior and Baxinger were some that were commonly available. The 1975 Japanese series Ultraman was aired, and was named as such since the protagonist had eyes resembling eggs. The children were fascinated. Kids tried to \\"fly\\" in the air, imitating their heroes. Two kids (aged 3½ and 4½) attempted a flight jumping off a 7-storey building in Kowloon City on 26 July 1975. The younger brother was killed on the spot, while the elder was miraculously saved. The broadcast of the series was suspended for a while after the accident. =Cinema= The martial arts films starred by Bruce Lee, including the 1971 The Big Boss () and Fist of Fury () the following year, were sensational. Cornered for some times by Western and Mandarin films, Cantonese films were much revived in the 1970s, with the great success of 1976 The Private Eyes (), directed by Michael Hui, which is said to remain the all- time box-office king of Hong Kong cinema when inflation is taken into account. The James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun in 1973 was filmed in Hong Kong. The film featured the wreck of SS Seawise University and that of the famous former Cunard Ocean liner RMS Queen Elizabeth. =Natural disasters= In August 1971, Typhoon Rose passed over Hong Kong causing extensive damage, forcing the hoisting of Hurricane Signal No. 10 on 16 August. A total of 5,664 people from 1,032 families became homeless. The typhoon also destroyed 653 wooden huts and damaged 24 buildings, six beyond repair.HK gov. \\"HK gov.\\" HK Observatory report. Retrieved 21 February 2007. In June 1972, torrential rains caused two serious landslides in Sau Mau Ping and the Mid-levels respectively. Around 150 were killed and many buildings were destroyed. In August 1979, Typhoon Hope reached Hong Kong but has weakened considerably from the 150 mph wind earlier. =Law and order= Anti-corruption campaigns In the 1970s, corruption was a way of life in Hong Kong, being the norm in all government departments. Policemen would often extract bribes (popularly called \\"tea fee\\") before they investigated a crime, as did firemen before they rescued people and put out fires. Many Chinese detective superintendents amassed incredible wealth from their corrupt dealings with triads and corporations. Their names have been seared into the memories of the older generations, their stories adapted into several popular movies such as To be Number One (跛豪) in 1991. That is not to say British officers were entirely clean in their dealings. In 1974, Hong Kong Governor Murray MacLehose, realising the seriousness of the problem, founded the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). The investigations and arrests of many police officers created a furore among the police, who protested against the ICAC and even tried to overrun the headquarters in one protest. The Governor, concerned to avoid a possible police strike or even rebellion, at last issued a pardon, preventing arrests in cases committed before 1977. However, the pardon did not extend to higher-level detective superintendents. These high-level Chinese officers, famous for their riches, left for exile to Taiwan, which had no extradition treaty with Hong Kong. In time, the efforts of the ICAC changed the habits of an entire population and turned Hong Kong into one of the least corrupt cities in the world. Politics =Defend Diaoyutai Islands campaigns= In 1970, the American government returned to Japan the sovereignty of Ryukyu Islands and Diaoyutai Islands (known as the Senkaku Islands to Japan). The act stirred up campaigns for defending the Diaoyutai Islands among Chinese societies all around the world. The \\"Hong Kong Federation of Students\\" (香港專上學生聯會) requested a protest at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay on 7 July 1971. Having been frightened by the 1967 riots, the police tried to prevent the protest. Unnecessary violence erupted, leading to the arrests of students. The media criticised the violation of democracy. The British police officers involved were sent back to the UK and went unpunished. Protests concerning the defence of Diaoyutai Islands continued to be held the following months. Economy =Manufacturing= Many factors contributed to the decline of manufacturing in Hong Kong. The late 1970s saw increases in land prices. Along with the opening up of global trade with China via the 1978 economic reforms, factories were gradually relocated to the mainland, where labour costs were lower. At the same time, Singapore and Taiwan underwent similar developments to those of Hong Kong. The competitiveness of manufacturing similar products led to protectionism to shelter local companies. As a result, there was less demand for Hong Kong goods. =Property and land= Following decades of immense and sustained immigration, the shortage of housing in the territory became acute. Many lived in squatter settlements or boats, where they were susceptible to typhoons, fires and landslides. To improve the quality of public housing and relieve overcrowded conditions, the government announced the Ten-year Housing Programme (十年建屋計劃) in 1972, with the goal of providing quality housing for 1.8 million people in 10 years. The Hong Kong Housing Authority was formed to spearhead the programme. The government also introduced the Home Ownership Scheme (居者有其屋計劃) in 1976, building houses and selling them at below-market prices to help people own property. =Emerging businesses= Wellcome, the first supermarket in Hong Kong, was opened in Central in 1970. It was called \\"Gweilo market\\" by some locals, as most customers were westerners during the initial period of its operation, but Chinese citizens would soon embrace this new kind of store. By 1975, more than 200 big- and small-scaled supermarkets could be found in the city. These new stores eliminated most traditional rice dealers (米舖), wine shops (辦館) and convenient stores (See Dor) (士多). Wellcome and PARKnSHOP did not take long to capture the market. The front and full page ads of these two mega franchises aided in their increase in popularity where smaller traditional stores couldn't. The first McDonald's restaurant opened on Paterson Street, Causeway Bay in 1975.McDonald's official site. \\"McDonald's .\\" History. Retrieved 21 February 2007. =Infrastructure= The area around the entrance of the Cross Harbour Tunnel at the Island side in the 1970s, when the tunnel was being constructed. Hong Kong's first modern rapid transit, the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) was opened in October 1979. The first line served eastern Kowloon from Shek Kip Mei to Kwun Tong. In December, services were extended to Tsim Sha Tsui, and by 1980, it was possible to ride from Kwun Tong to the central business district in Central on the other side of the harbour on Hong Kong Island. The Cross-Harbour Tunnel, the first underwater tunnel in Hong Kong, opened in 1972. For the first time in the region's history, people could travel between Hong Kong and Kowloon without taking ferries. As a result, small electrical boats like sampans (小電船) were gradually eliminated. Kai Tak Airport was expanded in the first half of the 1970s to handle Boeing 747s, despite of the limited land space and proximity to nearby hills. =Finance= People grew richer entering the 1970s. Not surprisingly, people started to look for some means of investment. The passing of Banking Ordinance of 1964 would begin the tightening up of banks. A minimum capital of HK$5 million and liquidity ratio of 25% and limitation on loans and investments became the new requirements to operate legally.Jao YC. [2001] (2001). The Asian Financial Crisis and the Ordeal of Hong Kong. Quorum, Greenwood. People began to have more trust in their banks, and the accumulation of savings led to people's willingness to invest. Soon, the stock rush began. New stocks were on sale every day; brokerage houses mushroomed; some people quit their jobs to become full-time investors, suffering a kind of urban disease that doctors called \\"stock illness\\". It is said that the investors during this period numbered to 500,000. The Hang Seng Index kept soaring, but then crashed in March 1973, leaving many people bankrupt. The Hong Kong economy recovered only slowly over the next few years. In 1976, a \\"Deposit-taking Companies Ordinance\\" was also passed to enforce non-licensed bank institutions to register with the government. A minimum paid up capital requirement of HK$2.5 million was also required. The strategy was to mirror the Deposit Trust concept in the United States. =Resource= As a result of the water shut- down by mainland China during the Cultural Revolution riots in Hong Kong, the government responded with a desalination plant at Lok On Pai, Castle Peak in 1975. The High Island Reservoir construction went from 1969 to 1979, and was expected to be the same size as Plover Cove. The construction, contracted by a Japanese company cost more than HK$400 million.Mody, Ashoka. [1997] (1997). Infrastructure Strategies in East Asia: “The ”Untold Story\\". World Bank Publications.

The New Cardinals December 22, 1958 After studying at the Patriarchal Seminary of Venice, he was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Pietro La Fontaine on September 24, 1922. Urbani then did pastoral work in Venice until 1925, furthered his studies for a year, and taught at the seminary from 1927 to 1945. He was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on November 12, 1936, and later Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on June 5, 1943. On October 26, 1946, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Axomis.

She was the wife of Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X and the mother of Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. She occupies as significant place as any in the annals of Mysore history. Her contributions to the citizenry, her roles of Maharani as regent and as queen mother of young prince Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, one of the most illustrious rulers of India, has remained commendable. She is considered as one of the three rare gems in the history of Mysore queens. Life She was married to Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X on 26 May 1878. In 1881, the famous Rendition of Mysore was carried out and the British handed over the rule back to the natural prince Chamarajendra Wadiyar X, who was now 18, after 50 years. In 1884, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV was born to the royal couple. In quick succession, they also had another son, Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar, and three daughters. =Regency= Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar, on a visit to Calcutta in 1894, developed diphtheria and succumbed to sudden death there, thus abruptly cutting short, a promising reign that lasted only 13 years. He was just 32 and had already left his mark as an excellent leader. His death suddenly created a void as prince Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV was still in minority. The unexpected tragedy was regarded as a great national misfortune throughout India and was deplored by the British Government as an Imperial loss. The royal family plunged into great sorrow and the citizens felt orphaned. Such was his stature. The burden fell on Maharani Kempananjammanni. History posed a new challenge to her: a severe bubonic plague struck Mysore city, reducing the population to half. Under such circumstances, she was nominated as queen- regent, a post she held for about eight tough years, from 1895 to 1902, and served the people with great aplomb, dignity, devotion, discipline and distinction. She earned the respect of one and all for the fabulous way she held fort. She had the services of Dewan Sir K. Seshadri Iyer at that time and Sir T. R. A. Thumboo Chetty the Former Chief Judge, Senior Member of the Regency Council, who officiated many times as the Dewan, and later her brother Sir M. Kantaraj Urs (later Dewan) as her Private Secretary. She helped Mysore recover from slump. Progress in all fields resulted from their efficient administration and blessed the entire citizenry. Generation of electricity from river Cauvery, promoting Indian Institute of Science, construction of Mari Kanave Valley Anicut (Vani Vilas Sagara), construction of the new palace, extension of new localities in Mysore, water supply through pipes, and laying of foundation stone of Victoria Hospital in Bangalore were enough testimony. Maharani Kempananjamanni was a great believer in women's education and under her patronage Maharani's College got all due attention. She was a staunch follower of Hinduism, but respected all faiths equally. =Retirement and last days= When Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV came of age, it was time for her to retire. On 8 August 1902, he ascended the throne that marked the end of memorable regency and the beginning of what was to become Mysore's Golden Era, an era that came to be known by the encomium 'Ramarajya'. The British Government awarded her with a CI. After a brief illness, she died on the midnight of 7 July 1934, in Bangalore. Legacy There are many edifices in old Mysore area with prefix 'Vani Vilasa', like a Mohalla (extension), Water Works, Maternity Hospital, Girls High School, Bridge, Ladies Club, and a Road, which, to this day, commemorate her memory.

Legend According to the Edda and Völsunga saga, Hamdir and Sörli were the sons of Gjuki's daughter Gudrun and King Jonakr. Erp was the son of Jonakr from an earlier marriage. Svanhild, the daughter of Sigurd and Gudrun, was also raised by Jonakr. King Jörmunrek (Ermanaric) proposed to Svanhild through his son Randver, but the treacherous Bicke said that Randver tried to win Svanhild's love. Consequently, Jörmunrek sentenced Randver to death by hanging and had Svanhild trampled to death by horses. Gudrun then agitated her sons Hamdir and Sörli to avenge their half-sister. When Sörli and Hamdir met Erp en route, they did not understand his riddles and, thinking him arrogant, killed him. During the night, they arrived and they cut off Jörmunrek's hands and feet. This made Jörmunrek wake up and he cried for his housecarls. Hamdir said that if Erp had been alive he would have cut off the head. The housecarls could not kill the two brothers with sharp weapons, but an old one-eyed man (Odin) advised them to kill them with stones. This is why skaldic poetry used the \\"sorrow of Jonakr's sons\\" as a kenning for stones. In Ynglingatal (9th century), Þjóðólfr of Hvinir mentions their death in a comparison with the death of the Swedish king Anund: {  :Varð Önundr :Jónakrs bura :harmi heptr :und Himinfjöllum, :ok ofvæg :Eistra dólgi :heipt hrísungs :at hendi kom; :ok sá frömuðr :foldar beinum :Högna hrörs :um horfinn var.  :We all have heard how Jonkur's sons, :Whom weapons could not touch, with stones :Were stoned to death in open day, :King Onund died in the same way. :Or else perhaps the wood-grown land, :Which long had felt his conquering hand, :Uprose at length in deadly strife, :And pressed out Onund's hated life.  } Sources and historic basis The legend of Jörmunrek appears in the Poetic Edda as Hamðismál and Guðrúnarhvöt. It also appears in Bragi Boddason's Ragnarsdrápa, in the Völsunga saga, and in Gesta Danorum. Jordanes wrote in 551 that the Gothic king Ermanaric was upset with the attack of a subordinate king and had his wife Sunilda (i.e. Svanhild) torn to pieces by horses and as revenge Ermanaric was pierced with spears by her brothers Ammius (Hamdir) and Sarus (Sörli) and died from the wounds. The Annals of Quedlinburg (end of the 10th century) relates that the brothers Hemidus (Hamdir), Serila (Sörli), and Adaccar (Erp/Odoacer) had cut off the hands of Ermanaric.

The company was founded in 1997. Their earliest products included ISDN based solutions, the first being the ISDN Vigor128, a USB terminal adaptor for Windows and Mac OS. This was followed by the ISDN Vigor204 ISDN terminal adaptor/PBX and Vigor2000, their first router. Their head office is in Hsinchu, Taiwan with regional offices and distributors worldwide. DrayTek was one of the first manufacturers to bring VPN technology to low cost routers, helping with the emergence of viable teleworking. In 2004, DrayTek released the first of their VoIP (Voice-Over-IP) products which has become one of their key areas. In 2006, new products aimed at enterprises debuted, including larger scale firewalls and Unified Threat Management (UTM) firewalls products however the UTM Firewalls did not sell in sufficient volume and the UTM products ceased development and production. DrayTek's product line offers business and consumer DSL modems with support for the PPPoA standard compared to the more the widely supported PPPoE for use with full-featured home routers and home computers without more expensive ATM hardware. PPPoA is used primarily in the UK for ADSL lines. Most Vigor routers provide a virtual private network (VPN) endpoint connection, either as LAN-to-LAN (to another router endpoint elsewhere on the Internet) or as teleworker 'dial in' for a single remote device. In 2011, DrayTek added SSL VPN facilities into their range. Although DrayTek do produce some products using Linux (in common with many other vendors), most of their products are based around their own proprietary DrayOS operating system. Linux products includes the Vigor 3900, 2960 and the VigorAP wireless access points, though each of these relies on a large proportion of proprietary code. DrayTek was floated on the Taiwanese OTC securities market in 2001.  Vigor 2200USB  DrayTek released the Vigor2200USB router in the UK in 2002, a unique router for ADSL, the only router able to be connected to BT's newly launched USB-modem based ADSL service. The router did not incorporate a modem, but allowed certain specified USB ADSL modems to be connected; at the time many Internet Service Providers required their USB modems to be used rather than allowing connection of ADSL equipment directly to the telephone line (\\"wires-only\\" service). The product was devised in the UK by SEG Communications and developed by DrayTek engineers. This was the only router supporting a separate USB modem, and was the only router compatible with BT's new USB ADSL service. These factors made it very popular and firmly established DrayTek as a key player in the broadband Internet hardware market in the UK.  BT MCT SIN 498 Compliance  For the UK market, DrayTek were granted MCT approval for their VDSL2 products in 2015, a mandatory requirement for products connected to the UK network operated by BT Openreach (used by most ISPs).  VigorSwitch V1281  DrayTek released the VigorSwitch V1281 in 2018, starting a new product category converging AV (Audio/visual) applications with IP Switching. The VigorSwitch V1281 was an Ethernet switch, specifically intended for switching IP based video feeds between sources (DVD/Blu-Ray players, Set-top boxes, CCTV etc) and outputs (screens/projectors). A companion app for Android/iOS allowed selections of sources. The VigorSwitch V1281 was designed by Michael Spalter and developed by DrayTek's engineers using their new switch operating system. The V1281 was compatible with various 3rd party HDMI-IP adaptors, as well as DrayTek's own HVE290. A scripting API allows integration with 3rd party home automatic system. The VigorSwitch V1281 was initially available in the UK only.  VigorACS  VigorACS is DrayTek's own management system which allows the mass management, reporting and control of DrayTek product estates. It supports the latest generation of routers, wireless access points and Ethernet switches. DrayTek VigorACS can be run on customer's own servers, on commercial cloud hosted platforms or as a subscription on DrayTek's servers (available in various regions).  Vigor 120 & Vigor 130  The Vigor 120 (for ADSL) and Vigor 130 (for ADSL and VDSL) were modems introduced to allow the connection of Ethernet-based routers/firewalls to DSL lines. Many such products do not have built-in DSL interfaces of their own, or need additional modem connectivity for multiple WAN ports. The Vigor 120 was devised in the UK where PPPoA was commonly used for ADSL and where the PPPoA-to-PPPoE bridging provided a transparent connection for the secondary router/firewall. As a BT (MCT/SIN498) approved device, the Vigor 130 also ensures compliant with Openreach rules which mandate that approved. In some regions, the Vigor 120/130 were developed further to add very basic router facilities (but without the feature set of the main router series).

Promoting these DRE-critical aspects as first-class metadata disentangles code for controlling these non-function aspects from application logic and makes DRE system development more flexible. Since mechanisms to support various DRE-critical non-functional aspects can be easily verified, CIAO will also make configuring and managing these aspects easier. CIAO also provides an implementation of the AMI4CCM standard which provides the ability to perform asynchronous operations using a callback model. AMI4CCM is a separate OMG standard. CIAO also provides an implementation of the DDS4CCM standard which integrates DDS as publish- subscribe middleware into the component model. The CIAO DDS4CCM implementation supports RTI Connext DDS and OpenDDS as underlying DDS implementations. AXCIOMA is the open source successor for CIAO. By making benefit of the IDL to C++11 language mapping AXCIOMA is much easier to use as compared to CIAO. AXCIOMA implements also AMI4CCM and DDS4CCM.

The Rising Stars of Manga entry was a 15-page prequel to the manga. Although the manga is primarily a comedy, it includes several scenes of serious, gripping drama, and the first volume's plot and theme are solidly based in noir fiction. For the sake of clarity and brevity, this article refers to the original 15-page Rising Stars of Manga entry as \\"the short story\\" and the full-tankōbon graphic novels as \\"the books\\". Like almost all \\"original English-language manga\\", Dogby Walks Alone is \\"straight to tankōbon\\", and never had its individual chapters serialized in a magazine. Dogby, the protagonist of both stories, is an amusement park mascot who never speaks, and never removes the head from his costume (at least not anywhere the \\"camera\\" can see). The actual narrative and dialogue of the short story and the first book come primarily through \\"Snack Girl\\", Dogby's \\"Watson\\" who also has a huge crush on him. The second book in the series is subtitled \\"Dogby Walks Tall\\". Lead characters None of the characters in Dogby Walks Alone have real names, with the exception of Roy Happy, the owner of \\"HappyPlace\\", the amusement park where the stories take place (a direct homage to Disneyland and Roy Disney). In the short story, the shift manager is named Berger, but when the same character reappears in the book he is only referred to as \\"Former Shift Manager (Retired)\\". =Characters from the short story= *Dogby: A man in a dog suit who never speaks or shows his face to the \\"camera\\". Very smart, very strong, and an accomplished fighter. In the short story, just before he knocks out Katty Kit, Snack Girl removes the body of Dogby's costume for him (leaving the head) to show that Dogby is \\"ripped\\". Dogby is the protagonist of both stories. *Snack Girl: Dogby's sidekick and mouthpiece, who also has a huge crush on Dogby. She primarily provides the narrative of the story, and normally works at a concession stand, selling lemonade, churros, and other snacks. *Birdie: A man in a pelican suit who drives the Jungle Cruise steamboat. Birdie is an old- timer who's been around \\"since Snack Girl used to visit the park as a kid\\", and who showed Dogby the ropes when he first started at the park. *Princess: A girl in a thinly-veiled Snow White costume who is sleeping her way to the top of HappyPlace. Had a brief relationship with Dogby, along with pretty much every other male member of the park staff. *Katty Kit: A man in a cat suit who views himself as Dogby's rival but who Dogby and Snack Girl view as merely an annoyance. *Shift Manager Berger: One of the park's shift managers, with glasses, a pompadour, and two left feet. In the book, Shift Manager Berger is named \\"Former Shift Manager (Retired)\\". *Park Supervisor: An executive at the park who appears at the very end of the story. =Characters from the first book= The first book features all of the preceding characters, and adds several more. *Roy Happy: The owner of the amusement park, whose face is always hidden from the camera. He keeps a white cat in his lap and does several other things that are direct homages to Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the nemesis of James Bond. *Park Upper Management Guy: His name pretty much says it all, and is usually abbreviated in the story to P.U.M.G. *New Shift Manager: A man in a cowboy hat and a puffy coat who started out at the park at the same time as Dogby and Princess. All three of them became friends while working together in the park's \\"Chinatoon\\" section. *Queen Sunshine: A girl in a thinly-veiled Cinderella costume. New Shift Manager's girlfriend. *Head of Park Security: Wears a uniform reminiscent of M. Bison's, which is used to comical effect halfway through the manga. *The Duchess: A girl whose costume appears to be modelled after Princess Leia. A friend of the Princess. *Petey: The dog mascot of \\"Illusion Valley\\", the other amusement park in the area (a reference to Six Flags Magic Mountain). A shadowy figure whose true motives aren't entirely clear, but acts as a stronger nemesis for Dogby than Katty Kit did. Plot The original 15-page story for Rising Stars of Manga 2 features Dogby and Snack Girl clearing Birdie of the theft of 20 pounds of hot dogs. The two full volumes of the manga are each complete stories. In the first book, Dogby solves a murder, while the rest of the park is on the brink of civil war over the mysterious theft of a week's ticket sales. In the second book, Dogby helps defend an Alaskan town from a gang of Russian Imperialists.

Founded in 1945, the university is named in honor of both the late President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The university enrolls around 6,000 students between its undergraduate and graduate programs. Roosevelt is also home to the Chicago College of Performing Arts. The university's newest academic building, Wabash, is located in The Loop of Downtown Chicago. It is the tallest educational building in Chicago, the second tallest educational building in the United States, and the fourth-largest academic complex in the world.  History  The university was founded in 1945 by Edward J. Sparling, the president of Central YMCA College in Chicago. He refused to provide Central YMCA College's board with the demographic data of the student body, fearing the board would develop a quota system to limit the number of African Americans, Jews, immigrants, and women at the school. Sparling resigned under protest and took with him many faculty and students to start a new college. Faculty voted in favor 62 to 1, and students 488 to 2 for the school. In the beginning, the university had no library, campus, or endowment. The new college was chartered as Thomas Jefferson College on March 28, 1945 and had financial backing from Marshall Field III, the Julius Rosenwald Foundation, the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, and numerous other individuals and organizations. Two weeks later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt died. The college obtained his widow Eleanor's permission to rename the institution as Roosevelt College in his memory. In 1947, the college purchased the Auditorium Building for one dollar, and it became the permanent home. The college was rededicated to both Franklin and Eleanor in 1959. Early advisory board members included Marian Anderson, Pearl Buck, Ralph Bunche, Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann, Gunnar Myrdal, Draper Daniels, and Albert Schweitzer. In August 1996, the university opened its Albert A. Robin Campus in Schaumburg, after a donation from Albert A. Robin, an entrepreneur and immigrant. On March 9, 2020, Robert Morris University Illinois merged with Roosevelt University. The integrated university continued under the name of Roosevelt University. Robert Morris added its majors to Roosevelt’s large portfolio of undergraduate and graduate programs under the name Robert Morris Experiential College, one of several colleges of Roosevelt University. =Presidents= * Dr. Ali Malekzadeh (2015–present) * Dr. Charles R. Middleton (2002–2015) * Dr. Theodore L. Gross (1988–2002) * Dr. Rolf Weil (1965–1988)First as Acting President, then in 1967 as elected President. * Dr. Robert Pitchell (1963–1964)\\"Pitchell held a doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley, and was an Indiana University political scientist and tax expert. He was hired as Roosevelt's second president after an 18-month national search, but his tenure only lasted for one year. Sometimes called \\"the forgotten president,\\" he failed in raise money or understand the strong culture of shared governance at Roosevelt and so did not gain the support of the deans and trustees.\\" Laura Mills and Lynn Y. Weiner: Roosevelt University, p. 66. See also: * Dr. Edward J. Sparling (1945–1963)  Campus  = Downtown Chicago campus = Chicago classes are held within Roosevelt's historic Auditorium Building at 430 S. Michigan Avenue, blocks from the Magnificent Mile. The Auditorium Building houses the Auditorium Theatre of Roosevelt University and numerous administrative offices for the university. A second downtown campus building is the Gage Building, located at 18 S. Michigan Avenue. It also houses the Gage Gallery and administrative offices for the College of Education, Manfred Steinfeld School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Paralegal Studies Program and the School of Communication. Murray-Green Library on the 10th floor of the Auditorium Building Pro football's 2015 NFL Draft was held in the Auditorium on April 30, 2015, the league's first time hosting the draft in Chicago in more than 50 years. In Spring 2010, construction began on a new building for the downtown campus, which was completed in Spring 2012. The 32-story vertical campus, the Wabash Building, is the second-tallest higher-education building in the United States and the sixth tallest in the world. It serves as a multipurpose building: housing student services, classrooms, contemporary science labs, administrative offices, and student residences. Student residences are on the top floors (14-32), with a shared lounge overlooking Lake Michigan on each floor. The university held an open house in the summer of 2012, with classes beginning in the new addition during the fall 2012 semester. The Lillian and Larry Goodman Center, the first stand-alone facility for college athletics in Chicago's Loop, is the latest addition to Roosevelt University's downtown Chicago campus and serves as the home for Roosevelt Lakers athletics. = Albert A. Robin Campus, Schaumburg = Roosevelt University's campus in Schaumburg is the largest four-year university in Chicago's Northwest suburbs, serving approximately 2,500 students. The campus is located in the former headquarters office building of the Pure Oil Company. Roosevelt converted the building into a comprehensive campus in 1996. The Albert A. Robin Campus is home to the Doctor of Pharmacy program, which accepted its inaugural class in July 2011. Roosevelt's PharmD program is the Midwest's only three-year, year-round program of its kind. In July 2014, it achieved full accreditation for its Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum. The campus is also home to the University's only PhD program (Industrial-Organizational Psychology), which began in August 2012. Located on 30 acres, the Schaumburg Campus is on the north side of Golf Road Illinois Route 58 across from the Woodfield Mall and near the intersection with Meacham Road (). Recently, campus administrators have created prairies on sections of the land for environmental and educational purposes. Academics The university offers undergraduate and graduate degrees through seven schools: Chicago College of Performing Arts (Music Conservatory), Chicago College of Performing Arts (Theatre Conservatory), College of Arts & Sciences, College of Education, College of Pharmacy, Heller College of Business and Robert Morris Experiential College. In addition, the university operates a variety of centers and institutes. Social justice, a cornerstone of Roosevelt's history and development, has been purposefully embedded into the school's curriculum and is part of every student's academic experience. Topics previously covered have included such issues as public versus private rights to use city parks, the impact of gentrification following urban modernization projects, and the impact one can have to preserve the earth's natural resources. Student-led research projects and theses have also touched areas such as gender equality and the effects of minimum wage on the economy.  Student life and residence life  An architectural model of the university's newest building Roosevelt University currently has three residence hall options, including the new vertical campus. The new Wabash building serves as housing for all incoming freshmen and transfers. The University Center of Chicago is the other main residence hall, with apartment style options. It was officially opened in the fall of 2004 and is located at 525 S. State Street. The UCC houses students from Roosevelt University, DePaul University, and Columbia College Chicago, totaling 1700 residents from these three schools combined. The second residence hall is Fornelli Hall, with apartment-only options, located in the Pittsfield Building at 55 E. Washington Street, Chicago. It opened in the fall of 2008. It provides apartment-style housing for upperclassmen from Roosevelt University. The Herman Crown Center, located at 425 S. Wabash Avenue, Chicago, was the main residence hall for Roosevelt until it was closed in the spring of 2008. Like the Herman Crown Center, the new 32-story vertical campus is connected to the Auditorium Building and provides direct access between the two buildings. = Student activities = There are many active student organizations at both of the Roosevelt University campuses. * Alpha Gamma Delta Women's Fraternity: an international fraternity and a member of the National Panhellenic Conference; was installed at Roosevelt in 2008 and was the 182nd chapter * Alpha Phi Omega: co-ed National Service Fraternity; charter for the Alpha Phi Omega chapter was originally at Central YMCA, transferred on reactivation at Roosevelt *Sigma Alpha Iota: International Music Women's Fraternity.

Men's sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, and track and field; women's sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, and track and field. The Lakers announced in April 2020 their addition of football and men's/women's ice hockey that will begin play in the 2020–21 academic year, having been acquired from Robert Morris when they competed as the Eagles. The Lakers ice hockey teams joined the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) and inherited the Eagles' former ACHA affiliation. The 20,000-capacity Toyota Park is the home of the Roosevelt Lakers soccer teams. Roosevelt University revived its athletic program after a 20-year absence in 2010. Roosevelt added women's volleyball for the 2011-12 academic year, followed by men's golf, men's and women's soccer, and softball for the 2012–13 academic year. The expansion of the university's athletics has brought the number of sport offerings from the initial seven sports to fourteen. After the 2020 merger, Roosevelt's acquisition of Robert Morris's football and men's/women's ice hockey teams was completed. The Lillian and Larry Goodman Center is located at 501 S. Wabash Avenue, which is the southeast corner of the intersection known as Ida B. Wells Drive and Wabash Avenue. The Goodman Center is a two-story, 27,834-gross-square-foot field house featuring a multi-purpose gymnasium on the second floor and first-floor space containing offices, meeting rooms, a team lounge, locker rooms, an athletic training room, and a strength and conditioning center. In popular culture The lobby stairwell of the Auditorium Building (430 S. Michigan Avenue) was featured in the film The Untouchables. The lobby was also the set of a nightclub scene in the 2009 film Public Enemies. In the summer of 2005, the Murray-Green Library on the 10th floor of the Auditorium Building was used as a set for the film The Lake House, in which the room doubled as an architect's office. Notable people The university's alumni includes many entertainers, academics, and politicians such as Anthony Braxton, Danitra Vance, and Harold Washington, while its first advisory board lists figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Albert Einstein.

It was set up officially on 1 January 1800 at the same time as the Corps législatif. Its first president was the historian Pierre Daunou, whose independent spirit led to his dismissal from the post by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. The Tribunat assumed some of the functions of the Council of Five Hundred, but its role consisted only of deliberating projected laws before their adoption by the Corps législatif, with the legislative initiative remaining with the Council of State.  Elections  As with elections to the Corps législatif, members of the Tribunat were not elected by direct universal suffrage. They were chosen via a complex process by the Senate from the \\"national lists of notables\\" (\\"listes nationales de notabilités\\") set up following a series of votes \\"en cascade\\" - the citizens would first elect \\"communal notables\\" from one tenth of their number, who would choose \\"departmental notables\\" from one tenth of their number, who would in turn choose \\"national notables\\" from another one tenth of their number.  Functions  The Tribunat's function was to send three orators to discuss proposed laws with government orators in the presence of the Corps législatif. It could not vote on such laws, but its decisions did have some consequence, if only as a consultative opinion, with the final decision always coming back as a last resort to the First Consul, who might or might not take the Tribunat's opinion into account. The Tribunat could also ask the Senate to overturn \\"the lists of eligibles, the acts of the Legislative Body and those of the government\\" on account of unconstitutionality, but the Tribunat's opinion was, once again, non-binding.  History  Shortly after the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire, the Tribunat became a focus of opposition to the regime the First Consul was in the process of setting up. Also, on 7 January, Benjamin Constant entered the Tribunat and, in a speech that made him leader of the opposition, denounced \\"the regime of servitude and silence\\" Bonaparte was preparing. The Tribunat was made up of liberal personalities like Constant, whose independent point of view Bonaparte saw as prejudicial to the public order and political unity he was trying to establish. Thus it was first purged after its opposition to the projected Code civil in 1802 (a purge made possible by a manoeuvre - the Tribunat was partially renewed at the regular interval, but it was unknown who in the Tribunat would be the first to be removed, and therefore Napoleon chose his opponents), then suppressed by a decree of the Senate in 1807, with its remaining functions and members absorbed into the Corps législatif.http://www.napoleon- series.org/research/government/legislation/c_tribunate.html It is notable that the Corps législatif tended to reinforce the powers of the executive. The introduction of the plebiscite, reducing the chambers' legitimacy and thus their power, had the same aim. The Tribunat was an organ intended to improve separation of powers, but the way that the separation of powers was structured did not let the Tribunat run effectively. Organisation and constitution The Constitution of Year VIII organised the Tribunat: The Constitution of 16 thermidor year X (4 August 1802) foresaw: The Constitution of the Year XII stated that: Sessions *1st session: from 1 January 1800 (11 nivôse year VIII) to 7 November 1800 (16 brumaire year IX). *2nd session: from 22 November 1800 (1 frimaire year IX) to 7 November 1801 (16 brumaire year X). *3rd session: from 22 November 1801 (1 frimaire year X) to 14 August 1802 (26 thermidor year X). *4th session: from 20 August 1802 (2 fructidor year X) to 20 August 1803 (2 fructidor year XI). *5th session: from 26 September 1803 (3 vendémiaire year XII) to 2 June 1804 (13 prairial year XII). *6th session: from 2 December 1804 (11 frimaire year XIII) to 30 December 1805 (9 nivôse year XIV). *7th session: from 1 January 1806 to 12 May 1806. *8th session: from 14 August 1807 to 18 September 1807.

Wilhelma Zoo is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Baden-Württemberg, seeing more than 2 million visitors annually. The Zoo and Botanical Garden have been staffed since 1846. The Moorish Revival style echoing the Alhambra have been maintained and supplemented since 1960. Today, the zoo has an area of about , houses around 11,500 animals from around the world composed of roughly 1,200 species and roughly 6000 plants from all climates. Of Germany's zoos, Wilhelma's collection ranks second to the Berlin Zoological Garden. In addition to the public garden, Wilhelma also has a branch office located in Fellbach, where the zoo keeps its stallions. Wilhelma receives gorilla juveniles rejected by their mother and reared by the zookeepers. At age 2-3, the gorillas are sent back to their original zoo(s). History View of Wilhelma circa 1855.

Then Duke William I of Württemberg decided to build a royal bathhouse in the gardens. The Duke decided that the bathhouse should be built in the Moorish style in the same fashion as the Alhambra in the Spanish province of Granada, with an attached Orangery. Unfortunately, construction ground to a halt in 1816 due to economic woes caused by the Year Without Summer, so Wilhelma became just another summer residence of the Dukes and later Kings of Württemberg. Ludwig von Zanth was hired in 1837 to design and construct the Duke's bathhouse. 1842 saw the completion of the first few buildings of the Duke's bathhouse and the site received the name Wilhelma. The imaginative von Zanth knew how to fire up the Duke's mind and thus was able to complete the Duke's summer villa, which consisted of a residential building, a domed hall and two neighboring greenhouses, each with a corner pavilion. In 1846, the marriage between Charles I of Württemberg and Olga Nikolaevna of Russia was celebrated at Wilhelma, which by now had a banquet hall, two main building with several courtrooms, several gazebos, greenhouses and a large park. The cottage would be finished 20 years later. =Beginning of Modern Wilhelma= The abdication of King in 1918 saw Wilhelma pass into the possession of the city of Stuttgart and state of Baden-Württemberg. To this day it has been maintained by the Ministry of Finances.mfw.baden-wuerttemberg.de Wilhelma was opened to the public in 1919 as a botanical garden. A significant part of the zoo's income was the orchid collection, which brought in money by selling offspring from the garden (a practice at that time unique in Germany). The Imperial Garden Show of 1939 took place in Stuttgart at Wilhelma.Schöchle, p. 129 Wilhelma was badly damaged during World War Two Allied bombing raids during the night of October 19 and 20, 1944. The Garden and Orangery suffered extensive damage; the plants that had not been moved prior to prevent their destruction were either destroyed or heavily damaged. The then director of the gardens, Albert Schöchle wanted to restore the gardens but also had an idea to once again incorporate animals on the property. =Establishment= 1949 saw the reopening ceremony that featured an aquarium. In 1950 a bird exhibit featuring cassowaries, a pheasant, rheas, ostriches, and birds of paradise was unveiled at Wilhelma.Schöchle, p. 153 This exhibition was followed by the \\"Animals of the German Fairy Tale\\" in the same year. It featured such animals as brown bears, lions, various snakes including anacondas and pythons, and dinosaurs, giant turtles, and crocodiles.Schöchle, p. 149 Another exhibit, \\"Animals of the Plains of Africa,\\" once again featured lions, crocodiles, antelopes, waterbucks, zebras, wildebeests, and giraffes.Schöchle, p. 154 The \\"Indian Jungle Exhibit\\" was the most successful exhibit in the entire history of Wilhelma. The display included elephants, tigers, leopards, Asiatic black bears, and Macaques.Schöchle, p. 155 Even though the state of Baden- Württemberg's Ministry of Finances ordered the animals from those exhibits removed, the order was never carried out. 1965 saw the founding of the Association of Friends and Supporters of Wilhelma. =Expansion= 1960 was a good year for Wilhelma; the Stuttgart Council of Ministers approved expansions of the zoo, and this was approved by the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg 1961. New additions to the zoo included the renovation of King Wilhelm's Moorish villa into the exhibit for nocturnal animals in 1962, the construction of a new modern building and an aquarium in 1967, and buildings and exhibits for big cats, rhinos, and hippos in 1968. Then director Albert Schöchle retired in 1970 and was replaced by Wilbert Neugebauer. Under Neugebauer, a building for the zoo's monkeys completed in 1973, South American plants in 1977, hoofed African animals in 1982, Sub Tropics exhibit in 1981, and Youngstock House in 1982. Biologist Dieter Jauch became the third director in 1989, previously working as the curator of the aquarium. In Jauch's tenure, the previous system for bears and climbing animals was revised in 1991, the zoo's demonstration farm was completed in 1993, and a new aviary for the zoo's penguins and kangaroo enclosure were completed in the same year. Wilhelma's Amazon House was finished in 2000, the insectarium in 2001, the Bongo exhibit was expanded in 2003, Crocodile Hall was renovated in 2006, the Elephant enclosure was renovated in 2012, the meerkat hall was finished in 2013, and the African Apes Hall was opened that same year. Further work by Jauch included a new outdoor terrarium and the expansion of the bison enclosure in 2013. Thomas Kölpin became director in 2014. His tenure saw the conclusion of the renovation of the old palace into the nocturnal animals hall (1962–2014) with the aim to build an entirely new building for the zoo's nocturnal animals in Elephant Park, and the finishing of the small animals house (1968–2014). =Current use= By 1993, Wilhelma reached its current size. A new ape house was opened in May 2013 (construction cost 22 million euros). The redesigned exterior of the elephant enclosure was completed in April 2012. To make room for even more elephants, the rhinos will be moving to their previous enclosure. A new hippo plant on the Neckar with a new pedestrian crossing is in development. A collaboration with the Neckar-Käpt'n and the National Museum of Natural History on this topic is being discussed. Construction will connect Wilhelma to Stuttgart 21 and B10 tunnel; Wilhelma will serve as a railroad stop on the B10 route. Construction is to begin in September 2015. Another 20 year bill granting funds for further expansion to Wilhelma was put up for consideration by the Ministry of Finances was approved July 2015. Exhibits Elephant House =Pachyderms= The Elephant and Rhino houses were completed in 1968, and ropes were later installed in 1990 to replace the chains. The grounds of both buildings were redesigned in 2012 to include trees and an animal friendly scrub basin, increasing its total size to . In addition, a clay wallows and two basins with interchangeable substrates (e.g. bark mulch, gravel.) were added. Currently, there are two living elephants at Wilhelma: Pama (1966) and Vella (1967). Previous elephants include Vilja, the oldest living elephant in Europe, died July 10, 2010 (cause of death is thought to be circulatory collapse), and Molly, whom was euthanized in July 2011 at the age of about 45 years. Other elephants at the zoo include the African elephant Jumbo and, briefly, an Asian bull elephant sent by the Indian state as a gift to Stuttgart. Another construction project, announced in a speech, that will begin in 2020 is in the planning stages. Wilhelma's rhinos, housed in the same building as the elephants, include:Bruno, the bull, who was raised in Cologne, and until 2019 Sani who was given to Stuttgart by the Nepalese state as a gift in 1993. Together, they made up the current breeding pair. Before them, Wilhelma's Rhino breeding pair were Nanda and Puri. The Tapir House, built in the Expansion era in 1968, housed the pygmy hippo bull, Hannibal, the hippos Rosi and Maikand some warthogs.Neugebauer, p. 30 The building houses today malayan tapirs and babirusas. The aged Pygmy Hippo bull, Hannibal =Ungulates= The plant complex for African ungulates which includes the giraffe house, was opened 1980th Today there live zebras, giraffes, kudus, okapi, Dorcas gazelle, Marabou stork and Somali wild ass. Wilhelma has been very successful in the breeding of giraffes, Somali wild asses, bongos, okapi, bontebok and zebras. Since 1989, a total of 12 okapi have arrived at Wilhelma. In the giraffe house there are not only the indoor enclosure of giraffe and okapi, but also the home of Congo peacocks, Fennec foxes, short-eared elephant shrews and weaver birds. Former residents include Grant's zebras, shoebills, porcupines, klipspringers, waterbucks, warthogs and numerous antelopes.Jauch, pp. 66–75 The \\"Ranch\\" that borders the Tapir House, new Ape House, and excavation site of the tunnel to Castle Rosenstein, was built as a temporary holding area in the 1980s. It houses takins and the zoo's bison, and an onager. =Primates= Old Ape House Construction of the outdoor area, 2012 The old Ape House, opened in 1973, was one of the most modern of its kind at the time. The building's design, since copied by numerous other zoos and again mimicked in the new ape house, was characterized by features like the carousel-style design of the enclosure and the tiles that line them and the specialized support disks that allowed increased force distribution.Schöchle, p. 247 The last two chimpanzees at Wilhelma were acquired in the summer of 2010 due to European Endangered Species Programme drive begun at Veszprém. Since the opening of the new ape house, the old house has been used exclusively for the zoo's orangutans. In 2011, it was announced that the zoo wished to remodel the enclosures of the orangutans, lutungs and gibbons. When the old ape house (built in 1973) no longer met international standards, Wilhelma had to build a new ape house. In Spring of 2010, the project began to not only meet international standards, but to also include housing for gorillas and bonobos in an outdoor area. The new building, 13 times the size of the original structure at , was opened to the public on May 14, 2013. Construction of the New Ape House wound up costing the zoo about 22 million euros, 70% more than the original 9.5 million euros financed towards the project. The unfortunate deaths of two bonobos thanks to malfunctioning components in the ventilation system have called the construction quality of the building into question. The Monkey facility, opened in 1973, now houses both gibbons and lutungs. Here, Wilhelma's breeding program for the Slim monkey is remarkable among other zoos in the world at 37 new pups. 2015 saw some remodeling done to the gibbons enclosure for visitor convenience. The building has housed Proboscis monkeys, Lion-tailed macaques, Drills, Doucs, and Spider and Capuchin monkeys. Since 1975, two other structures for (originally) housing primates were reconstructed. The larger of the two now houses Geladas, hyraxes, and Barbary sheep. The other still houses Japanese macaques. Javan lutung in the Monkey Hall =Birds= The first major expansion to Wilhelma's collection of birds began with the Sub Tropics Aviary in 1981 that houses kookaburras, Marbled ducks, Northern bald ibises, numerous species of parrot. A special feature of the aviaries is the only New Zealand kaka outside of New Zealand and the first successful breeding of a Kea in Germany. Due to the strain put on the historic wall of the Sub Tropic Aviary by the New Ape House, a new project for a larger aviary is pending. There are several aviaries behind Damascene Hall that were once used for Pheasantry when Wilhelma was still a palace for the King of Württemberg. In the post war period, these were used for housing small predatory animals including Canines, small cats, and civets.Schöchle, p. 176 Since the restoration of the aviaries in the 1990s, they now hold native birds such as partridges, Eurasian bullfinchs, sparrows, and various pigeon species. In 2015, a modification was made to these aviaries to house capercaillies for Wilhelma's in situ participation of Species protection in the Black Forest region.Jauch, pp. 150–151 For the 1993 World Horticultural Exposition, a new enclosure for African penguins (who had been at Wilhelma since 1953) to replace their old habitat in the Garden's ponds near the Moorish villa adjacent to the bird aviary. There also were located Humboldt, Rockhopper, Gentoo, and King penguins. Public feedings occur daily. In 1993, an aviary for birds from all over the world was constructed. Included are Black storks, ibises, Great hornbills, and an Asian and Australian community aviary that contains a Microbat exhibit and feeding kitchen.Jauch, pp. 155–157 Wilhelma's collection of cranes began with a bird exhibition in 1950: Redcrowned, Blue, and White- naped cranes and also a Hawaiian goose joined Wilhelma. Birds that used to have a presence at the zoo include other types of cranes, shoebills, geese, and curiously a Brush kangaroo.

However, in cultures that mark burial sites, the phrase unmarked grave has taken on a metaphorical meaning. Metaphorical meaning As a figure of speech, a common meaning of the term \\"unmarked grave\\" is consignment to an ignominious end. A grave monument (or headstone) is a sign of respect or fondness, erected with the intention of commemorating and remembering a person. =Criminals= Conversely, a deliberately unmarked grave may signify disdain and contempt. The underlying intention of some unmarked graves may be to suggest that the person buried is not worthy of commemoration, and should therefore be completely ignored and forgotten, e.g., Seung-Hui Cho and Adam Lanza. Unmarked graves have long been used to bury executed criminals as an added degree of disgrace. Similarly, many 18th and 19th century prisons and mental asylums historically used numbered (but otherwise featureless) markers in their inmate cemeteries, which allowed for record-keeping and visitations while also minimizing the shame associated with having one's family name on permanent display in such a disreputable context. Plot E at Oise-Aisne American Cemetery (consisting entirely of soldiers executed for rape and/or murder) is a rare example of this policy persisting into the 20th century. More recently, the practice has been to cremate and secretly scatter the ashes of notorious criminals in some anonymous place. This was the fate of Nazi war criminals such as Adolf Eichmann, Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler, Fritz Sauckel, and Julius Streicher. The remains of British serial killers Myra Hindley, Dr Harold Shipman, and Fred West were treated in the same way. The headstone of disgraced television presenter and sex offender Jimmy Savile was removed and destroyed three weeks after being erected, when posthumous allegations of sexual abuse over decades came to light. Cremation and secret scattering of the ashes has the additional effect of removing all possibility of there being a grave to visit in the future. =Judaism= In Judaism, contact with a corpse confers uncleanness (see Numbers 19:11-22 and Tractate Oholoth in the Mishna). Cohanim, descendants of Aaron, are prohibited from approaching within 4 cubits of a grave, except for when a funeral is of a close relative. Thus, an unmarked grave opens up the possibility that a pious Jew could become defiled without being aware that it happened. The Jews of early times, therefore, sought to avoid unmarked graves by two means: clearly designating cemeteries beyond the limits of their villages and cities, and making graves and tombs obvious by whitewashing them. This is the background for Jesus' comparison of the Pharisees of his time to white-washed tombs (see Matthew 23:27-28) and to \\"unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it\\" (Luke 11:44). Jesus warned that the Pharisees were defiling others by their hypocrisy, misplaced priorities, and selfish ambition. Other reasons for unmarked graves However, disdain and contempt are not the only reasons why graves remain unmarked. As Alicia Hoyt reports: \\"Historically, financial limitations and social status were factors in whether a person (even a famous one) was awarded a big fancy marker. Mass, unmarked graves were also common in times of widespread disease or war; plus older markers simply deteriorated over time or were stolen. Another reason might be: other gravesites reflect the wishes of the deceased or family members who simply don't want a marker, can't decide on wording, or plan to add one down the line when a loved one passes away and joins them in the plot. [sources: Texas Historical Commission, Washington Post]\\" Additionally, \\"modern celebrity concerns\\" may be related to a desire for privacy or to avoid vandalism. For example, basketball legend Kobe Bryant and daughter Gianna (whose grave sites lacks a headstone), Academy Award-winning actor George C. Scott, musician Frank Zappa, comedian John Belushi, and writer H. P. Lovecraft (discussed below) are notable people whose burial sites have been left unmarked (or marked deceptively) for reasons that are not financial. In cases when a person's remains are lost, a cenotaph may be erected. This is what happened to comedian John Belushi. The gravestone at his grave in a Martha's Vineyard cemetery was removed and relocated, after operators of the cemetery found many signs of vandalism and rowdiness, where his body lies. In response, a cenotaph gravestone was erected at a nearby empty grave, to deter disrespectful visitors, leaving his actual final resting place without a marker. Another John Belushi cenotaph gravestone was erected by his family in a Chicago area cemetery, at the Belushi family plot, where his parents are now buried. Similarly, when H. P. Lovecraft's headstone in Providence, Rhode Island was stolen, a replacement marker was erected in a different location. Deceased monarchs and princes of Saudi Arabia are buried in unmarked graves in the public Al Oud cemetery in Riyadh. There is also typically no public funeral or national show of mourning. The Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam practiced in Saudi Arabia considers public shows of grief or memorials to the dead to be un-Islamic, and therefore the royal family typically practices austere, private burials.

It attempts to provide efficient, predictable, and scalable quality of service (QoS) end-to-end. TAO applies the best software practices and patterns to automate the delivery of high- performance and real-time QoS to distributed applications. TAO is for developers of distributed and embedded applications who have stringent performance demands. Domain of application Certain real-time applications have benefited from TAO's use of familiar software concepts to present a solution to challenging real-time software problems. In general, real-time systems require predictable timing characteristics and robustness since they are used in mission-critical domains. Other real-time applications require low development cost and fast time to market. TAO addresses both of these by providing an already-implemented general-purpose communications framework that uses concepts familiar to non-real-time portions of the software industry. Advantages Traditionally, the barrier to viable real-time CORBA has been that many real-time challenges are associated with end-to-end system design aspects that transcend the layering boundaries traditionally associated with CORBA. That's why TAO integrates the network interfaces, OS I/O subsystem, ORB, and middleware services in order to provide an end-to-end solution. For instance, consider the CORBA Event Service, which simplifies application software by supporting decoupled suppliers and consumers, asynchronous event delivery, and distributed group communication. TAO enhances the standard CORBA Event Service to provide important features, such as real-time event dispatching and scheduling, periodic event processing, efficient event filtering and correlation mechanisms, and multicast protocols required by real-time applications. =Familiar concepts presented= TAO brings familiar concepts from elsewhere in the software industry to real-time systems. These concepts include CORBA, RPC, an OO presentation, and Berkeley-sockets. In OO, RPC is usually termed “remote method invocation” (RMI), because subroutines or procedures that are directly associated with objects or classes are termed methods, but the concept is fundamentally the same in that the caller at the origin is suspended while the method at the destination object executes. This provides a simplicity of execution of software that can be desirable when subroutine is the idiom that is intended in the design or architecture. Disadvantages =Suspension of execution= TAO, like all CORBA implementations, presents an OO RMI interface to the application. Invoking a subroutine suspends the execution of the superior who is delegating the operation and transfers the sole right to execute to the invoked method at the destination object, the subordinate to which the operation was delegated. Perhaps the caller could go on and perform other activities during that delegated operation, but the caller is suspended, awaiting the final accomplished result from the subordinate. This becomes especially troublesome when the superior and subordinate are on different processors. Because the superior is suspended and only the subordinate is actively executing, two threads on two processors are occupied in the accomplishment of a single delegated operation. Typically, the counter-measure to this when using RMI/RPC is to increase the number of threads in the superior to match the desired total number of concurrent operations throughout the set of all subordinates. The resources consumed by a thread are typically greater than the resources consumed by communicating each delegated operation to the subordinate. Thus the overhead of concurrency is multiplied when using an RPC/RMI approach when compared to the approach of allowing the superior to continue executing to perform other tasks. The alternative used by competitors to CORBA is simply to forgo the subroutine model so that the superior continues to execute concurrently with the delegated operations. The superior simply prepares a message that is sent to the subordinate. The subordinate immediately acknowledges the receipt of the message that requests the accomplishment of the delegated operation (without yet starting to accomplish the delegated operation itself). The superior then goes about other business, such as preparing messages for other delegated operations either to that same subordinate or to other subordinates. Each subordinate that has been delegated an operation, enqueues the operation's requesting message in a message queue that corresponds to the message's priority or deadline. A thread (perhaps in a thread pool) dequeues that message from that queue to accomplish the delegated operation. Upon accomplishment, the result is sent as a different message to the superior. The superior processes the result messages similarly to the way the subordinate processed the delegation messages. TAO provides this alternative through the asynchronous method invocation (AMI) and Asynchronous Method Handling (AMH) mechanisms. AMI is used by clients to make remote invocations without blocking for a response, the reply is received as a callback. AMH is used by servers to delay sending responses, for example, if the server itself needs to wait for other remote calls. AMI is part of the CORBA standard. AMH is a TAO extension to the CORBA specification. Availability TAO can be downloaded from the Internet and freely used and redistributed without developer or run-time licensing costs. Commercial support, documentation, training, and consulting for TAO are available from multiple vendors. Many other third-party tools and services have also been integrated with TAO. Remedy IT created an extension for TAO called TAOX11 which adds support for the IDL to C++11 Language Mapping to TAO. TAOX11 is available for free as open source product. TAO has been ported to many operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Embedded systems such as VxWorks and LynxOS, high end systems like OpenVMS, and Unix systems such as Solaris and Linux.

It is mainly used as the semiconducting material in cadmium telluride photovoltaics and an infrared optical window. It is usually sandwiched with cadmium sulfide to form a p–n junction solar PV cell. Typically, CdTe PV cells use a n-i-p structure.  Applications  CdTe is used to make thin film solar cells, accounting for about 8% of all solar cells installed in 2011. They are among the lowest-cost types of solar cell, although a comparison of total installed cost depends on installation size and many other factors, and has changed rapidly from year to year. The CdTe solar cell market is dominated by First Solar. In 2011, around 2 GWp of CdTe solar cells were produced; For more details and discussion see cadmium telluride photovoltaics. CdTe can be alloyed with mercury to make a versatile infrared detector material (HgCdTe). CdTe alloyed with a small amount of zinc makes an excellent solid-state X-ray and gamma ray detector (CdZnTe). CdTe is used as an infrared optical material for optical windows and lenses and is proven to provide a good performance across a wide range of temperatures. An early form of CdTe for IR use was marketed under the trademarked name of Irtran-6 but this is obsolete. CdTe is also applied for electro-optic modulators. It has the greatest electro-optic coefficient of the linear electro-optic effect among II-VI compound crystals (r41=r52=r63=6.8×10−12 m/V). CdTe doped with chlorine is used as a radiation detector for x-rays, gamma rays, beta particles and alpha particles. CdTe can operate at room temperature allowing the construction of compact detectors for a wide variety of applications in nuclear spectroscopy. The properties that make CdTe superior for the realization of high performance gamma- and x-ray detectors are high atomic number, large bandgap and high electron mobility ~1100 cm2/V·s, which result in high intrinsic μτ (mobility-lifetime) product and therefore high degree of charge collection and excellent spectral resolution. Due to the poor charge transport properties of holes, ~100 cm2/V·s, single-carrier-sensing detector geometries are used to produce high resolution spectroscopy; these include coplanar grids, Frisch-collar detectors and small pixel detectors.  Physical properties  *Thermal expansion coefficient: 5.9×10−6/K at 293 K *Young's modulus: 52 GPa *Poisson ratio: 0.41 = Optical and electronic properties = quantum confinement. Bulk CdTe is transparent in the infrared, from close to its band gap energy (1.5 eV at 300 K, which corresponds to infrared wavelength of about 830 nm) out to wavelengths greater than 20 µm; correspondingly, CdTe is fluorescent at 790 nm. As the size of CdTe crystals are reduced to a few nanometers or less, thus making them CdTe quantum dots, the fluorescence peak shifts through the visible range into the ultraviolet.  Chemical properties  CdTe is insoluble in water.Solubility is below 0.1mg/l which equals a classification as insoluble- reference, \\"ECHA Substance Registration\\" CdTe has a high melting point of 1041 °C with evaporation starting at 1050 °C. CdTe has a vapor pressure of zero at ambient temperatures. CdTe is more stable than its parent compounds cadmium and tellurium and most other Cd compounds, due to its high melting point and insolubility. Cadmium telluride is commercially available as a powder, or as crystals. It can be made into nanocrystals.  Toxicology assessment The compound CdTe has different qualities than the two elements, cadmium and tellurium, taken separately. Toxicity studies show that CdTe is less toxic than elemental cadmium. CdTe has low acute inhalation, oral, and aquatic toxicity, and is negative in the Ames mutagenicity test. Based on notification of these results to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), CdTe is no longer classified as harmful if ingested nor harmful in contact with skin, and the toxicity classification to aquatic life has been reduced. Once properly and securely captured and encapsulated, CdTe used in manufacturing processes may be rendered harmless. Current CdTe modules pass the U.S. EPA’s Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test, designed to assess the potential for long-term leaching of products disposed in landfills. A document hosted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health dated 2003 discloses that: > Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) > are nominating Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) for inclusion in the National > Toxicology Program (NTP). This nomination is strongly supported by the > National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and First Solar Inc. The > material has the potential for widespread applications in photovoltaic > energy generation that will involve extensive human interfaces. Hence, we > consider that a definitive toxicological study of the effects of long-term > exposure to CdTe is a necessity. Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have found that large-scale use of CdTe PV modules does not present any risks to health and the environment, and recycling the modules at the end of their useful life completely resolves any environmental concerns. During their operation, these modules do not produce any pollutants, and, furthermore, by displacing fossil fuels, they offer great environmental benefits. CdTe PV modules that use cadmium as a raw material appear to be more environmentally friendly than all other current uses of Cd. CdTe PV provides a sustainable solution to a potential oversupply of cadmium in the near future. Cadmium is generated as a waste by-product of zinc refining and is generated in substantial amounts regardless of its use in PV, due to the demand for steel products. According to the classification provided by companies to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in REACH registrations, it is still harmful to aquatic life with long lasting effects. Additionally, the classification provided by companies to ECHA notifications classifies it as very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects, very toxic to aquatic life, harmful if inhaled or swallowed and is harmful in contact with skin.  Availability  At the present time, the price of the raw materials cadmium and tellurium are a negligible proportion of the cost of CdTe solar cells and other CdTe devices. However, tellurium is a relatively rare element (1–5 parts per billion in the Earth's crust; see Abundances of the elements (data page)). Through improved material efficiency and increased PV recycling systems, the CdTe PV industry has the potential to fully rely on tellurium from recycled end-of-life modules by 2038. See Cadmium telluride photovoltaics for more information. Another study shows that CdTe PV recycling will add a significant secondary resource of Te which, in conjunction with improved material utilization, will enable a cumulative capacity of about 2 TW by 2050 and 10 TW by the end of the century.

The first volume became available in October 2005, the second was released in November 2006, and the third was released on July 2008. Synopsis Mark of the Succubus revolves around Aiden Landis, a normal 17-year-old boy, mild-tempered and indecisive, who’s never certain about what he wants for himself. His father wants him to be a lawyer while his girlfriend wants him to change for her own social desires. His teachers are all convinced that he could be a top student if he'd only stop daydreaming. Aiden just wants to play his guitar and, perhaps, write a meaningful song. Then he meets Maeve, a succubus-in-training. Maeve is a young succubus who hasn't yet gotten her license. She goes down to the human world nervously, enthralled by all she sees there- especially art and a certain teenaged human named Aiden Landis, who seems just as infatuated with her as she is with him. Maeve soon meets Aiden's quirky best friend, Devin, and his snobby, superficial girlfriend, Sandra, and learns about the wonders and perils of the human world. However, things may not go as smoothly as planned for Maeve. There is a demon on her tail who will do anything in her power to catch Maeve breaking the Rules of the demonworld, all in order to increase her own wealth and social status. What's more, Maeve must decide whom to place her deadly Mark upon- the Mark that inhabits the body of the first human she will kill. She's not sure how to dress, or talk, or act around humans- and what's more, she isn't sure that she'd like to seduce and kill one. Which could prove a difficulty for her, as that is exactly the reason that she's being sent to mingle with humans in the first place. And when she ends up falling in love with the same mortal that she's placed her Mark on, sentencing him to die, only trouble can result from such a blatant breaking of demon law. Characters ;Maeve *Age: 17 *Hair: Black *Eyes: Purple *Classification: Succubus Intent and studious, but a little absentminded, Maeve tends to stand out among demons and humans alike. Her quirky habits mark her as someone just learning the ways of a culture, and her utter inability to lie convincingly adds to the peculiar image. Despite her training, she often forgets what she's meant to be doing among the humans and loses herself in the fun of the moment. ;Aiden Landis *Age: 17 *Hair: Dark Brown *Eyes: Green Indecisive, mild-tempered, and a bit withdrawn, Aiden rarely protests when others make his decisions for him, drifint along in whateverdirection he's pushed with no real enthusiasm. Al he really wants to do is play guitar but only his best friend knows he's good at it: instead he puts a weak effort into things he doesn't truly care about, avoiding conflict at the expense of his own dreams. ;Sandra : ;Veril *Age: 965 *Hair: Auburn *Eyes: Grey *Classification: Incubus For most, Veril is a walking paradox. He has no qualms about seducing and killing humans, blackmailing superiors, or playing dirty to get his own way. At the same time however he has a strong sense of justice, and is fiercely loyal to those very few that are close to him. When his peculiar sense of is added to the mix, the incubus often comes across as a puzzle that is nearly impossible to figure out. Veril is an older brother/father figure to Maeve, whom he took in as his own when she was an infant or toddler. He cares deeply for her and will go to extreme lengths to keep her safe. ;Devin Wilshire *Age: 17 *Hair: Blonde *Eyes: Brown Loud and quite purposefly obnoxious to anyone he doesn't like, Devin is considered something of an oddball including those closest to him. His love of science fiction and conspiracy theories has left more than one person wondering whether his somewhat far-fetched personal conjectures are real or just for fun ;Sylne *Age: 1129 *Hair: Silver-Blue *Eyes: Turquoise *Classification: Succubus Charming, intelligent, and collected, there isn't much about Sylne not to like - on the surface, at least. Underneath, the woman's hand is always in some sort of scheme, and she's willing to sacrifice even those closest to her in an effort to gain more power. She's two-faced and underhanded, two very good things for a succubus to be. Desiring a certain title, and the power, fortune, and recognition that comes with it, Sylne placed an illegal Human Spell on the Imp, Junael, forcing him t spy on her old student, Maeve, expecting the girl's nature would cause the younger succubus to slip just enough to use for her own selfish purposes. Sylne is the top succubus in Erebus, a title she inherited from the prior top succubus (whose death Sylne arranged), and once had an intimate relationship with Veril but they grew apart. ;Junael *Age: 212 *Hair: Black *Eyes: Reddish-Brown *Classification: Imp *Animal Form: Crow Somewhat reserved, Junael is the sort who prefers to handle things behind the scenes. He's meticulously neat and pays close attention to detail; usually, he knows more about any given situation than he lets on. though his work requires him to make sure the rules are followed, he's found that knowing them well enough allows them to be bent when the time clls for it. He becomes a pawn of Sylne who places on him illegal Human Magic to control him, and he's forced to spy on Maeve, looking for any slip-ups or breaking the rules. He turns on Sylne and aids Maeve.

He was the son of Rodolfo Gucci, and grandson of Guccio Gucci.  Biography  Maurizio Gucci was born on September 26, 1948 in Florence, to Rodolfo Gucci and Sandra Ravel. In May 1983, Rodolfo Gucci died in Milan. His son, Maurizio Gucci inherited his father’s majority stake in the company and launched a legal war against his uncle Aldo Gucci for full control of Gucci (a prosecution led by the city prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani, and with Domenico de Sole representing the Gucci family). In 1988, Maurizio Gucci sold almost 47.8% of Gucci to the Bahraïn- based investment fund Investcorp (owner of Tiffany since 1984), and withheld the other 50%. From 1991 to 1993, Gucci's finances were in the red. Maurizio Gucci was blamed for spending extravagant amounts of money on the company's headquarters in Florence (Via delle Caldaie palazzo) and in Milan. Maurizio Gucci went on to sell his stock in Gucci in 1993 for $170 million to the Bahrain-based investment group, Investcorp. In 1995, a year and a half after the sale of Gucci, he was gunned down by a hired hit man. His ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani was convicted of arranging the killing in 1998.Dana Thomas, Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster, p. 59Sara Gay Forden, The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed, HarperCollins , 2001.

Although prepared by his parents for a military career, Kozlov chose to join Nikolai Przhevalsky's expedition. After his mentor's death, Kozlov continued traveling in Asia with his successors, Pevtsov and Roborovsky. In 1895, he took general command of the expedition from ailing Roborovsky. From 1899 to 1901, he explored and later described in a book the upper reaches of the Yellow River, Yangtze, and Mekong rivers, for which he received the Constantine Medal in 1902. During the first decade of the 20th century, when the Great Game reached its peak, Kozlov rivaled Sven Hedin and Aurel Stein as the foremost researcher of Xinjiang. Although he was on good terms with Hedin and other foreign explorers, the British government, as represented by George Macartney, monitored his movements across Central Asia. Kozlov's 1905 visit to the Dalai Lama in Urga gave \\"the British War Office a fright\\",Palace, Wendy. The British Empire and Tibet, 1900–1922. Routledge, 2005. . Page 71. especially after the Lama declared his intention to \\"settle within the confines of Russia\\".Andreyev, Alexandre. Soviet Russia and Tibet: The Debacle of Secret Diplomacy, 1918-1930s. Brill Publishers, 2003. . Page 29. During his expedition of 1907-1909, Kozlov explored the Gobi Desert and discovered the ruins of Khara- Khoto, a Tangut city destroyed by the Ming Chinese in 1372. It took him several years to excavate the site and bring to St. Petersburg no less than 2,000 books in the Tangut language he uncovered there. Kozlov described his findings in a large volume entitled Mongolia and Amdo and the Dead City of Khara-Khoto (1923). He was awarded the 1911 Royal Geographical Society's Founder's Gold Medal for his explorations. His last expedition to Mongolia and Tibet (1923–1926) resulted in the discovery of an unprecedented number of Xiongnu royal burials at Noin-Ula. After bringing to Petrograd some amazing samples of 2000-year-old Bactrian textiles, Kozlov retired from scientific work and settled in a village near Novgorod. Kozlov married Elizabeth Kozlova, a woman 29 years his junior, who accompanied him on his final journey of exploration as the expedition ornithologist, and who was to publish many monographs and scientific papers on the avifauna of Central Asia. Kozlov was a mentor of the Russian explorer and writer Vladimir Arsenyev.

The usage of the term has shifted over time, sometimes designating a film genre and at other times simply synonymous with big-budget filmmaking. Like epics in the classical literary sense it is often focused on a heroic character. An epic's ambitious nature helps to set it apart from other types of film such as the period piece or adventure film. Epic historical films would usually take a historical or a mythical event and add an extravagant setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by an expansive musical score with an ensemble cast, which would make them among the most expensive of films to produce. The most common subjects of epic films are royalty, and important figures from various periods in world history. Characteristics The term \\"epic\\" originally came from the poetic genre exemplified by such works as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the works of the Trojan War Cycle. In classical literature, epics are considered works focused on deeds or journeys of heroes upon which the fate of many people depend. Similarly, films described as \\"epic\\" typically take a historical character, or a mythic heroic figure. Common subjects of epics are royalty, gladiators, great military leaders, or leading personalities from various periods in world history. However, there are some films described as \\"epic\\" almost solely on the basis of their enormous scope and the sweeping panorama of their settings such as How the West Was Won or East of Eden that do not have the typical substance of classical epics but are directed in an epic style. When described as \\"epic\\" because of content, an epic movie is often set during a time of war or other societal crisis, while usually covering a longer span of time sometimes throughout entire generations coming and passing away, in terms of both the events depicted and the running time of the film. Such films usually have a historical setting, although fantasy or science fiction settings have become common in recent decades. The central conflict of the film is usually seen as having far-reaching effects, often changing the course of history. The main characters' actions are often central to the resolution of the societal conflict. In its classification of films by genre, the American Film Institute limits the genre to historical films such as Ben-Hur. However, film scholars such as Constantine Santas are willing to extend the label to science-fiction films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Wars. Lynn Ramey suggests that \\"Surely one of the hardest film genres to define is that of the \\"epic\\" film, encompassing such examples as Ben-Hur, Gone with the Wind....and more recently, 300 and the Star Wars films...none of these comes from literary epics per se, and there is little that links them with one another. Among those who espouse film genre studies, epic is one of the most despised and ignored genres\\". Finally, although the American Movie Channel formally defines epic films as historical films, they nonetheless state the epic film may be combined with the genre of science-fiction and cite Star Wars as an example. Stylistically, films classed as epic usually employ spectacular settings and specially designed costumes, often accompanied by a sweeping musical score, and an ensemble cast of bankable stars. Epics are usually among the most expensive of films to produce. They often use on- location filming, authentic period costumes, and action scenes on a massive scale. Biographical films may be less lavish versions of this genre. Many writers may refer to any film that is \\"long\\" (over two hours) as an epic, making the definition epic a matter of dispute, and raise questions as to whether it is a \\"genre\\" at all. As Roger Ebert put it, in his \\"Great Movies\\" article on Lawrence of Arabia: The comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail had the joking tagline \\"Makes Ben-Hur look like an epic.\\" History The epic is among the oldest of film genres, with one early notable example being Giovanni Pastrone's Cabiria, a three-hour silent film about the Punic Wars, which laid the groundwork for the subsequent silent epics of D. W. Griffith. The genre reached a peak of popularity in the early 1960s, when Hollywood frequently collaborated with foreign film studios (such as Rome's Cinecittà) to use relatively exotic locations in Spain, Morocco, and elsewhere for the production of epic films such as El Cid (1961) or Lawrence of Arabia (1962). This boom period of international co-productions is generally considered to have ended with Cleopatra (1963), The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), and Doctor Zhivago (1965). Nevertheless, films in this genre continued to appear, with one notable example being War and Peace, which was released in the former Soviet Union during 1967–1968 and, directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, is one of the most expensive films ever made. Epic films continue to be produced, although since the development of CGI they typically use computer effects instead of an actual cast of thousands. Since the 1950s, such films have regularly been shot with a wide aspect ratio for a more immersive and panoramic theatrical experience. Epic films were recognized in a montage at the 2006 Academy Awards. Public reception =Gross revenue= The enduring popularity of the epic is often accredited to their ability to appeal to a wide audience. Many of the highest-grossing films of all-time have been epics. James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic, which is cited as helping to revive the genre, grossed $658 million domestically and over $2.1 billion worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film of all-time behind the 2019 film Avengers: Endgame and the 2009 film Avatar, another James Cameron epic which grossed $2.7 billion worldwide. If inflation is taken into account, then the historical romantic epic Gone with the Wind becomes the highest-grossing film ever in the United States (two other romantic epics, Titanic and Doctor Zhivago also feature in the top ten as the 5th and 8th highest grossers respectively). Adjusted for inflation it earned the equivalent of $1.6 billion in the United States alone. Adjusted for ticket price inflation, the science fiction/fantasy epic Star Wars stands at number 2, with an inflated gross of $1.4 billion in the United States. =Academy Awards= So far the most Academy Awards ever won by a single film stands at 11. This feat has only been achieved by three films: Ben-Hur (1959), Titanic (1997) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), all of which are above 3 hours long and considered epic films. The previous record holder was Gone With The Wind (1939), also an epic, with 10 awards.

The Gordon opened in 1887 and celebrated 130 years of providing education in 2017. The Gordon provides education to 13,500+ students annually and with 500+ staff members, it is one of the largest employers in Geelong. The Gordon offers 350+ courses across several campuses located in Geelong City, East Geelong, Werribee and Hoppers Crossing. Sixty percent (60%) of The Gordon students live in the wider Geelong region. History The Gordon Institute of TAFE was opened in 1888 as the Gordon Memorial Technical College. The college had its beginnings in 1885, when 500 people met at the Geelong Town Hall to decide upon a memorial to General Charles George Gordon, who died at Khartoum in January 1885. William Humble (owner of the Vulcan Foundry) and George link (Matthew Flinders school headmaster) decided that a school of art be erected in his honour. Opening of the Gordon Technical College, 1910 The foundation stone was laid in July 1887 for the first building, Davidson Hall. The land selected for the school was originally part of Johnstone Park, Geelong. January 16, 1888 saw the first term at the Gordon Memorial Technical College commence. There were 63 students enrolled, in subjects ranging from mechanical drawing, to architecture, and languages. In 1890 the two storey trade engineering and chemistry buildings opened on Fenwick Street. April 1891 saw the three storey administration building open next door. Behind this building a time capsule was laid. Opened in 1987, the capsule contained copies of Geelong and Melbourne newspapers of the time, as well as reports from the city council. The northern Fenwick Street building was added in 1916, and the Hitchcock art studio in 1910. In November 1921 the college changed its name to the Gordon Institute of Technology. It was also at this time that the Lascelles chemistry laboratory opened on Gordon Avenue, followed by the Bostock lecture hall next door in 1928. 1927 saw the first buildings at the Moorabool Street campus built, and in 1941 the trade workshops were the first college buildings erected on the Latrobe Terrace side of the railway line. The 1960s saw the first of the modern multi storey buildings built on the site. Gordon Institute of TAFE, circa 1940-1955 In 1969 the Gordon expanded yet again, with land being purchased at Waurn Ponds. A building for the Applied Sciences was first built, followed by a library and student lodgings in 1975. On 1 April 1976, Deakin University was established by merging the Gordon Institute of Technology's higher education courses and Waurn Ponds site with the State College of Victoria at Geelong (previously \\"Geelong Teachers' College\\"). The Moorabool St campus and the vocational courses now became Gordon Technical College. At this time this campus was expanded, and the East Geelong campus opened. References *Peter Begg (1990).

Collins Crime Club – A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (Page 15) It features her Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and the recurring character Ariadne Oliver. This was the last novel to feature either character, although it was succeeded by Curtain: Poirot's Last Case, which had been written in the early 1940s but was published last. Elephants Can Remember concentrates on memory and oral testimony. Plot summary At a literary luncheon Ariadne Oliver is approached by a woman named Mrs Burton-Cox, whose son Desmond is engaged to Oliver's goddaughter Celia Ravenscroft. Mrs Burton-Cox questions the truth regarding the deaths of Celia's parents. Fourteen years before, Oliver's close school friend Margaret Ravenscroft and her husband, General Alistair Ravenscroft, were found dead near their manor house in Overcliffe. Both had been shot with a revolver found between their bodies, which bore only their fingerprints. The investigation into their deaths found it impossible to determine if it was a double suicide, or if one of them murdered the other and then committed suicide. Their deaths left Celia and another child orphaned. After consulting Celia, Mrs Oliver invites her friend Hercule Poirot to resolve the issue. Poirot and Mrs Oliver proceed to meet elderly witnesses associated with the case, whom they dub \\"elephants\\", and discover that Margaret Ravenscroft owned four wigs; that the Ravenscrofts' dog was devoted to the family, but bit Margaret a few days before her death; that Margaret had an identical twin sister, Dorothea, who had spent time in a number of psychiatric nursing homes, and was believed to have been involved in two violent incidents in Asia, including the drowning of her infant son after the death of her husband; and that a month before the couple died Dorothea had been sleepwalking and had died after falling off a cliff. Later Poirot learns the names of governesses who served the Ravenscroft family, one of whom, Zélie Meauhourat, travelled to Lausanne after the couple's deaths. Poirot soon turns his attention to the Burton-Cox family, and learns that Desmond was adopted and knows nothing about his birth mother. Through his agent, Mr Goby, Poirot learns that Desmond is the illegitimate son of a deceased actress, Kathleen Fenn, who once had an affair with Mrs Burton-Cox's husband and who bequeathed a considerable fortune to Desmond, to be held in trust until he was of age or had married, and which would go to his adoptive mother if he died. Poirot suspects that Mrs Burton-Cox wants to prevent the marriage of Desmond and Celia in order to maintain the use of the money, but he finds no suggestion that Mrs Burton-Cox wishes to kill her son. Eventually he begins to suspect the truth about the Ravenscrofts' death and asks Zélie to return to England to help him to explain it to Desmond and Celia. Poirot reveals that the woman who died with Alistair was not his wife but her twin, Dorothea. A month before the deaths she had fatally injured Margaret and Margaret had made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest. Alistair had Zélie help him to conceal the truth of his wife's death by planting her body at the foot of a cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died, then having Dorothea take the place of his wife. While she fooled the Ravenscrofts' servants, the family dog could not be deceived and thus bit her. A month after his wife's death Alistair murdered Dorothea to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making certain that she held the revolver before she was killed, and then he committed suicide. Knowing the facts, Desmond and Celia can face the future together. Characters * Hercule Poirot, the Belgian detective * Ariadne Oliver, a celebrated author * Chief Superintendent Garroway, the investigating officer, now retired * Superintendent Spence, a retired police officer * Mr Goby, a private investigator * Celia Ravenscroft, daughter of the victims and one of Mrs Oliver's many godchildren * Desmond Burton-Cox, Celia's boyfriend * Mrs Burton-Cox, Desmond's avaricious adoptive mother * Dr Willoughby, a psychiatrist specialising in twins * Mademoiselle Rouselle, a former governess to the Ravenscroft family * Zélie Meauhourat, another former governess to the Ravenscroft family The \\"Elephants\\" * The Honourable Julia Carstairs, a social acquaintance of the Ravenscrofts * Mrs Matcham, a former nursemaid to the Ravenscroft family * Mrs Buckle, a former cleaner to the Ravenscrofts * Mrs Rosentelle, a hairstylist and former wigmaker Literary significance and reception Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 5 November 1972 called the novel \\"A quiet but consistently interesting whodunnit with ingenious monozygotic solution. Any young elephant would be proud to have written it.\\"The Observer, 5 November 1972 (p. 39) Other critics were less kind. Robert Barnard called the novel \\"Another murder-in-the-past case, with nobody able to remember anything clearly, including, alas, the author. At one time we are told that General Ravenscroft and his wife (the dead pair) were respectively sixty and thirty-five; later we are told he had fallen in love with his wife's twin sister 'as a young man'. The murder/suicide is once said to have taken place ten to twelve years before, elsewhere fifteen or twenty. Acres of meandering conversations, hundreds of speeches beginning with 'Well, …' That sort of thing may happen in life, but one doesn't want to read it.\\"Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive – An Appreciation of Agatha Christie, revised edition (p. 193). Fontana Books, 1990; According to The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, this novel is one of the \\"execrable last novels\\" in which Christie \\"loses her grip altogether\\". Elephants Can Remember was cited in a study done in 2009 using computer science to compare Christie's earlier works to her later ones. The sharp drops in size of vocabulary and the increases in repeated phrases and indefinite nouns suggested that Christie may have been suffering from some form of late-onset dementia, perhaps Alzheimer's disease. This could have also been done purposefully, to reflect the fickle nature of memory. References to other works * The character of Superintendent Spence previously appeared in Taken at the Flood, Mrs McGinty's Dead and Hallowe'en Party. The last two of these cases are discussed in Chapter 5 of the novel, along with the case retold in Five Little Pigs. * Mr Goby is a recurring character in many of the later Poirot novels. Although he does not appear in the previous novel, Hallowe'en Party, he is mentioned as having contributed to that investigation in Chapter 21 of that novel. * In Chapter 3 Mrs Oliver fondly recalls a copy of the book Enquire Within Upon Everything that had been owned by her Aunt Alice. This is also the book in a copy of which a will is found concealed in Hallowe'en Party. Adaptations =Television= The novel was adapted into a TV film with David Suchet as Poirot, as an episode in the final series of Agatha Christie's Poirot. It was broadcast on ITV on 9 June 2013, and later on the Acorn TV website on 11 August 2014, over a year later. Zoë Wanamaker returned to the role of Ariadne Oliver, marking her fifth out of six appearances on the show in total. Greta Scacchi (Mrs Burton-Cox), Vanessa Kirby (Celia Ravenscroft), Iain Glen (Dr Willoughby) and Ferdinand Kingsley (Desmond Burton-Cox) were also among the cast. The adaptation is generally faithful to the novel, but includes some significant additions to the plot. Most notably, there is a gruesome present day murder for Poirot to solve, which raises the tension and allows for a suspenseful ending. The plot of the novel, involving delving into the past, is reduced to background information leading to the present-day murder. Characters such as Mr Goby, Miss Lemon, George, Marlene Buckle (whose mother becomes Mrs Matcham's housekeeper) and ex-Chief Superintendent Spence were removed from the story (Spence's character is replaced with an original character named Beale), whilst the characters of Zélie Meauhourat and Mme Rouselle were combined. Instead of immediately helping Mrs Oliver with the Ravenscroft case, Poirot instead chooses to investigate the murder of Dr Willoughby's father, which is a subplot that is not in the novel; as a consequence, Dr Willoughby's character is greatly expanded. When Poirot realises that Dr Willoughby and his institute have a connection to the Ravenscrofts, Poirot decides to solve both mysteries. This subplot also includes an original character named Marie McDermott, an Irish-American girl who works as Dr Willoughby's filing clerk and turns out to be his mistress. The character is ultimately revealed to be Dorothea Jarrow's daughter, who is avenging her mother for the cruel treatments she experienced at the hands of Professor Willoughby (an entirely fictional version of hydrotherapy), and also for her mother's murder (as she was at Overcliffe on the day of the tragedy and overheard General Ravenscroft make his plans) by trying to kill both Celia and Desmond. Zélie spirited her away to Canada after the tragedy, and she had to wait thirteen years before she could earn enough money to travel to England and exact her revenge. Also, in keeping with the other episodes, the story is moved from the early 1970s to the late 1930s. This leads to an anachronism when there are references to chemotherapy as a cure for cancer. =Radio= Elephants Can Remember was adapted for radio by BBC Radio 4 in 2006, featuring John Moffatt as Poirot and Julia Mackenzie as Ariadne Oliver. =Film adaptations= The 2007 Thai film Alone is loosely inspired by Elephants Can Remember.

It was the first dynastic regime to wield power over the Yemeni lowland after the introduction of Islam in about 630. The establishment of the dynasty Muhammad ibn Ziyad was a descendant of Yazid, younger brother of the first Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I.Eduard de Zambaur, Manuel de généalogie et de chronologie de l'histoire de l'islam (Hannover 1927), Table F. In 814 he was arrested and brought to the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun on account of his ancestry, but his life was spared in the end. He was merely placed under surveillance and became the protégé of the caliph's minister al-Fadl ibn Sahl.Encyclopaedia of Islam (Leiden 2002), p. 572. Three years later a letter from the governor of Yemen arrived to Baghdad, complaining about attacks by the Ash'arite and Akkite tribes. Al-Fadl recommended that al-Ma'mun send the capable Muhammad ibn Ziyad to Tihamah in order to suppress the tribes. The situation was particularly critical since the Alids under a leader called Ibrahim al-Jazzar threatened to detach Yemen from Abbasid control at this time. Muhammad ibn Ziyad was a sworn enemy of the Alids, which made him a suitable choice for the task.H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its medieval history (London 1892), pp. 2-4, 219. After performing the hajj, Muhammad marched south to Yemen with an army of Khurasani soldiers and arrived there in 818. He fought numerous battles against the tribes and won control over the Tihama lowland in the next year.Ziyadids, G.R. Smith, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. XI, ed. P.J. Bearman, T. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs, (Brill, 2002), p. 523. Geographical extension and economic base Following his victories, Muhammad was appointed amir of Yemen by al-Ma'mun with the task to restrain 'Alid Shi'a influence.C.E. Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties, (Columbia University Press, 1996), 99. Muhammad established a new city, Zabid, as his capital. It was built in a circular shape and situated midway between the sea and the mountains. He was able to expand his influence into Hadramawt and parts of highland Yemen, all the while recognizing Abbasid overlordship.C.E. Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties, p. 99. The historian Umara enumerates his possessions as including Hadramawt, Diyar Kindah, Shihr, Mirbat in Oman, Abyan, Lahij, Aden and the maritime provinces as far north as Hali, as well as Janad, Mikhlaf al-Ma'afir, Mikhlaf Ja'far, San'a, Sa'dah, Najran, and Bayhan in the highlands.H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history (London 1892), p. 5. However, the sources are somewhat obscure since the historian al-Hamdani asserts that another family, Banu Shurah, exercised paramount power in the Tihama for parts of the ninth century and were established in Zabid. From other sources it appears that San'a in fact continued to be governed by an Abbasid governor up to 847.H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history (London 1892), p. 219. Little is known about the economic structure of the Ziyadid realm, but the historian Umara writes that the dynasty was bolstered by the flourishing international trade. The ruler received duties from ships coming from India. From the east came luxury products such as musk, camphor, ambergris, sandalwood and porcelain. From Africa came Ethiopian and Nubian slaves via the Dahlak Archipelago. Umara also mentions taxes on ambergris collection at Bab al-Mandab and the south coast, and on pearl fishing.H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history (London 1892), p. 8. Independent rule Meanwhile, Abbasid rule in Arabia was declining. After the violent end of caliph al-Musta'in in 866, the second Ziyadid ruler, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, kept the tax revenues for himself and adopted royal trappings. He nevertheless continued reciting the khutba in the name of the Abbasids. As the Ziyadids' power tended to be concentrated on the lowland, and the Abbasid governors in the highland lacked support from their home base in Iraq, other dynasties were established. The Yufirids established an independent state in San'a in 847 and forced the Ziyadid ruler to tolerate their rule in exchange for mentioning him on coins and in the Friday prayer. An imam of the Shi'ite Zaydiyyah sect, al- Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya established a power base in the northern highlands in 897; it was the beginning of the Yemeni imamate that endured until 1962. Furthermore, the late ninth and early tenth centuries saw a great deal of agitation by Ismaili figures who adhered to the Fatimid imam (whose descendants were later to become caliphs in Egypt). Zabid itself was sacked by the sectarian Qarmatians, an Ismaili branch, in 904.Stanley Lane Poole, The Mohammadan Dynasties, (Elibron Classics, 2006), p. 90. Under the lengthy reign of Abu'l-Jaysh Ishaq (r. 904-981), the Ziyadid dynasty experienced a temporary revival. However, when Abu'l-Jaysh grew old the outer regions began to fall away from Ziyadid rule. Towards the end of his reign the area between Aden and ash-Sharjah remained under his control.H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history (London 1892), pp. 237-8. Ash-Sharjah was probably located some 50 kilometers north of Luhayyah and has nothing to do with Sharjah in the present United Arab Emirates. Even as late as 976, the royal revenues amounted to a million gold dinars.C.E. Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties, p. 99; H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history (London 1892), p. 8. Erosion of Ziyadid power The Yufirids again attacked in 989 and burnt Zabid. However, the Mamluk al-Husayn bin Salamah managed to save the kingdom from complete collapse. He defeated the mountain tribes and restored the Ziyadid realm to its old limits. Al-Husayn was remembered as a just and high-spirited regent who dug wells and canals and constructed roads across the kingdom. He governed until his peaceful demise in 1012.H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history (London 1892), p. 9. The back side of the coin was that the Ziyadid monarchs lost effective power after 981 while a succession of Mamluks held real power, which at length made for political turmoil. After al-Husayn's death, his slave, the eunuch Marjan, held power as wazir. He in turn raised two Ethiopian slaves called Nafis and Najah who received high offices in the state. According to Kamal Suleiman Salibi, the last Ziyadi ruler was murdered in 1018 and replaced by Nafis.Kamal Suleiman Salibi, A History of Arabia (Caravan Books, 1980), p. 108. Nafis adopted royal titles but was immediately challenged by Najah, who defeated Nafis and Marjan and founded the Najahid dynasty in 1022. List of Ziyadid rulersThe list follows H.C.

On September 21, 2001, she was arrested and subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit espionage for the government of Cuba. Montes eventually pleaded guilty to spying and in October 2002, was sentenced to a 25-year prison term followed by five years' probation. Early life and career Montes was born in West Germany, where her father, Alberto Montes, was posted as a United States Army doctor. Her family was of Asturian origins (a region in Spain), and her grandparents had immigrated to Puerto Rico. The family later lived in Topeka, Kansas, and then Towson, Maryland, where she graduated from Loch Raven High School in 1975. In 1979 she earned a degree in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia, and in 1988 she finished a master's degree at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Montes' brother and sister, Tito and Lucy, became Federal Bureau of Investigation officers and her former boyfriend, Roger Corneretto, was an intelligence officer specializing in Cuba for the Pentagon. Ana Montes receiving a Certificate of Distinction from CIA director George Tenet, 1997 Montes joined the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in September 1985 after working for the United States Department of Justice. Her first assignment was at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington where she worked as an intelligence research specialist. In 1992, Montes was selected for the DIA's Exceptional Analyst Program and later traveled to Cuba to study the Cuban military. Prior to her arrest, she lived in a two bedroom co-op in Cleveland Park, Washington, DC. Montes advanced rapidly through the ranks at the DIA and became its most senior Cuban analyst. Her co-workers regarded her as responsible and dependable, and noted her \\"no-nonsense\\" attitude. Prosecutors would later allege that Montes was already working for the Cubans when she joined the DIA in 1985. Espionage Montes had been recruited by Cuban Intelligence while she was a university student at Johns Hopkins University in the 1980s. She became known to other students for her strong opinions in support of left wing Latin American movements like the Sandinista National Liberation Front in Nicaragua. A Cuban agent eventually approached her. After recruiting her, the Cuban Intelligence Service groomed her to pursue employment with the Defence Intelligence Agency. In their charging documents, federal prosecutors stated: The prosecutors further stated that all of the information was on water- soluble paper that could be rapidly destroyed. During the course of the investigation against her, it was determined that Montes had passed a considerable amount of classified information to the Cuban Intelligence Directorate, including the identities of four US spies in Cuba. In 2007, American DIA counterintelligence official Scott W. Carmichael publicly alleged that it was Ana Montes who told Cuban intelligence officers about a clandestine US Army camp in El Salvador. Carmichael alleged that Montes knew about the existence of the Special Forces camp because she visited it only a few weeks before the camp was attacked in 1987 by Cuban-supported guerrillas of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). Carmichael, who had led the DIA investigation of Montes, named her as being directly responsible for the death of Green Beret Sergeant Gregory A. Fronius who was killed at El Paraíso, El Salvador, on March 31, 1987, during the FMLN attack. Carmichael characterized the damage Montes caused to the DIA and other US intelligence agencies as \\"exceptionally grave,\\" and stated that she compromised a \\"special access program\\" that was kept even from him, the lead investigator on her case. Encryption/decryption \\"cheat sheet\\" used by Montes In a May 6, 2002, interview with CBS News, former Undersecretary of State John Bolton stated that an official 1998 US government report with significant contributions by Montes concluded that Cuba did not represent a significant military threat to the United States or the region. Bolton alleged that it was not possible to exclude the possibility that the administration of President Bill Clinton may have overlooked Cuba as a potential threat because of Montes' influence and the way she shaped reporting at the DIA. Carmichael further alleged that, unlike many in the US intelligence community, he believed that Montes' penetration of the DIA was not the exception, but the rule, and that the Cuban intelligence services had multiple spies and moles within US intelligence agencies. In 2004 a federal indictment alleged that Montes had assistance from another Cuban agent, Marta Rita Velazquez, once a legal officer at the United States Agency for International Development, who was further alleged to have recruited Montes into espionage. The federal indictment was unsealed in April 2013. Velazquez has been outside the US since 2002, apparently in Sweden, which does not have an extradition treaty with the US for spy cases.Charge in Cuban spy case unsealed, accusing ex-State Dept. officer of conspiracy. Washington Post/ Associated Press, Thursday, April 25, 2013. Arrest Montes was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation at her office on September 21, 2001, soon after the September 11th attacks. Prosecutors stated that Montes had been privy to classified information about the US military's impending invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, and that they did not want her revealing this information to potential enemies. In 2002, Montes pleaded guilty to the charge which could have carried the death penalty, but was sentenced to 25 years in prison in October of the same year after accepting a plea agreement with the US government. According to her lawyer, Plato Cacheris, Montes committed the espionage for moral reasons, as \\"she felt the Cubans were treated unfairly by the U.S. government.\\" Incarceration FMC Carswell, where Montes is incarcerated As of December 2019, Montes is incarcerated at FMC Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas. FMC Carswell is listed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons as a facility located in the northeast corner of the Naval Air Station, Joint Reserve Base, Fort Worth, which provides specialized medical and mental health services to female offenders. Montes is listed as FMC Register #25037-016. Her tentative release date is listed as January 8, 2023.

The act of so moving is termed pioneering. Baháʼís refrain from using the term \\"missionary\\". The first pioneer to enter a country or region mentioned in ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan is given the title of Knight of Baháʼu'lláh. During the Ten Year Crusade which ran from 1953 to 1963, hundreds of pioneers settled in countries and territories throughout the world, which eventually led to the establishment of 44 new National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies and the increase in the Baháʼí population. Teaching work The teaching work done by pioneers was done in many different ways including, but not limited to *Conversation with people who are receptive to the teachings of the Baháʼí Faith. *Firesides: meetings held in one's home to which those interested in the Baháʼí Faith are invited. *Public talks: Lectures given about the Baháʼí Faith. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Baháʼí Faith in the first half of the 20th century, has written: :\\"An effort, moreover, can and should be made, not only by representative Baháʼí bodies, but also by prospective teachers, as well as by other individual believers, deprived of the privilege of visiting those shores or of settling on that continent, to seize every opportunity that presents itself to make the acquaintance, and awaken the genuine interest, of such people who are either citizens of these countries, or are in any way connected with them, whatever be their interests or profession. Through the kindness shown them, or any literature which may be given them, or any connection which they may establish with them, the American believers can thereby sow such seeds in their hearts as might, in future circumstances, germinate and yield the most unexpected results. Teaching versus proselytization For Baháʼís, pioneering refers to something similar to missionary work. However, Baháʼís do not consider pioneering to be proselytism, a word which often implies the use of coercion to convert someone to a different religion. :\\"Care, however, should, at all times, be exercised, lest in their eagerness to further the international interests of the Faith they frustrate their purpose, and turn away, through any act that might be misconstrued as an attempt to proselytize and bring undue pressure upon them, those whom they wish to win over to their Cause.\\" :\\"It is true that Baháʼu'lláh lays on every Baháʼí the duty to teach His Faith. At the same time, however, we are forbidden to proselytize, so it is important for all the believers to understand the difference between teaching and proselytizing. It is a significant difference and, in some countries where teaching a religion is permitted, but proselytizing is forbidden, the distinction is made in the law of the land. Proselytizing implies bringing undue pressure to bear upon someone to change his Faith. It is also usually understood to imply the making of threats or the offering of material benefits as an inducement to conversion. In some countries mission schools or hospitals, for all the good they do, are regarded with suspicion and even aversion by the local authorities because they are considered to be material inducements to conversion and hence instruments of proselytization.\\"Letter from the Universal House of Justice, 1982 Jan 03, Teaching vs. Proselytizing. The following is a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual: :\\"He sees no objection to the word Missionary appearing on your passport as long as it is clearly understood what kind of a 'missionary' a Baháʼí pioneer is. In the best and highest sense of the term it certainly could be applied to our teachers. Unfortunately this word has often been associated with a narrow-minded, bigoted type of proselytizing quite alien to the Baháʼí method of spreading our teachings.\\"Letter written by Shoghi Effendi on February 7, 1945 published in Widespread effect During Baháʼu'lláh's lifetime (died 1892) he encouraged some of his followers to move to India.Baháʼí History by Moojan Momen and Peter Smith When the religion began to grow in India, other Baháʼís moved on - for example entering Vietnam and other places in 1950s. During the 1950s and 1960s the Baháʼí Faith spread rapidly in Vietnam, and the nearby countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. From 1957 to 1963 the Baháʼí community in Vietnam had more than tripled. The Tablets of the Divine Plan to the followers of the religion in the North America, especially to the United States, in 1916-1917 by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, head of the religion until 1921 when he died, asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. Their publication was delayed in the United States until 1919 -- after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. Following their publication the first Baháʼí permanent resident in South America, Leonora Armstrong, arrived in Brazil in 1921. Shoghi Effendi, who was named ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Baháʼí Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote: > \\"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá > in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming > National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of > Baháʼí Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous > stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. > Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in > American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace > the light of the Faith of Baháʼu'lláh and establish structural basis of His > World Order.\\" Following the 1 May cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on 19 May calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Baháʼí North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Baháʼís to go to Latin America. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937-44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Baháʼís the goal of establishing the Baháʼí Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Baháʼís in Latin American, Baháʼí communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America. The first pioneer to Chile arrived in 1940 when her ship docked at Arica. After arriving in Panama in 1940, the first Guaymí Baháʼí converted in the 1960s. In 1985-6 the \\"Camino del Sol\\" project included indigenous Guaymí Baháʼís of Panama traveling with the Venezuelan indigenous Carib speaking and Guajira Baháʼís through the Venezuelan states of Bolívar, Amazonas and Zulia sharing their religion. In 1946, a great pioneering movement began with sixty per cent of the British Baháʼí community eventually relocating. Internationally this effort would take the Baháʼí Faith to Scotland, Wales, and Ireland and raising the numbers of Local Assemblies in the British Isles. In 1950-1 the Baha'is of the British Isles pioneered to Tanganyika, Uganda, and Kenya. On August 3, 1951 pioneers arrived in Kampala from which pioneers went to French Equatorial Africa, and Cameroon and so on. From 1953 to 1963 some 250 Americans and Persians moved to many locations. Wide-scale growth in the religion was observed following this across Sub-Saharan Africa.] Notes Category:Bahá'í practices ","title":"Pioneering (Baháʼí)"},{"id":"2084468","text":"\\"The Sacred War\\" ( Svyashchennaya Voyna, also known as Vstavay, strana ogromnaya, \\"Arise, Great (Vast) Country!\\") is one of the most famous Soviet songs of the Second World War. The music is by Alexander Alexandrov, founder of the Alexandrov Ensemble and the music composer for the State Anthem of the Soviet Union. The lyrics are by Vasily Lebedev-Kumach. The circumstances of the composition and first performance of the song were hurried; the lyrics were published on 24 June 1941, and Alexandrov immediately wrote the music for them, writing the notes out on a blackboard for the singers to copy manually. The first performance was on 26 June at Belorussky Railway Station, where according to eyewitnesses it was sung five times in succession.В. Олару. Стихотворение в газете Независимая Молдова, 21 июня 2001 () There are a number of foreign-language adaptations of this song, among them the German version Der Heilige Krieg (written by Stephan Hermlin), the Korean 정의의 싸움에 (Jeong-ui- ui Ssaum-e) and the Hungarian version Fel, küzdelemre, hős haza. In the 1990s Russian media published the allegation that the lyrics had been plagiarized by Lebedev-Kumach, and that they were indeed written during the First World War by Aleksandr Bode (, 1865-1939). These claims were taken to court, and the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta in June 2000 was forced to publish a retraction of the claim.Опровержение Независимая газета, 5 июля 2000; A.

It consists of a finely crystalline mix of kamacite & taenite, plus other minor minerals. Santiago Papasquiero is a strange ataxite that appears to be a completely metamorphosed and recrystallized octahedrite. Field of view ~2.5 cm across. This is a cut, polished, nitric acid-etched surface. Ataxites (from Greek meaning \\"without structure\\") are a structural class of iron meteorites with a high nickel content and show no Widmanstätten patterns upon etching. Characteristics Ataxites are composed mainly of meteoric iron, a native metal found in meteorites that consists of the mineral taenite with minor amounts of plessite, troilite, and microscopic lamellae of kamacite. Ataxites are the most nickel-rich meteorites known; they usually contain over 18% nickel.Vagn F. Buchwald, Handbook of Iron Meteorites. University of California Press, 1975 The high nickel content is the reason that they do not develop a Widmanstätten structure, because in this case kamacite can be exsolved from taenite only at such a low temperature (below about 600°C) where diffusion is already too slow.F. Heide, F. Wlotzka, Meteorites, Messengers from Space, Springer-Verlag 1995, page 143 Classification Most ataxites belong to the IVB group or are classified as \\"Iron, ungrouped\\" because they do not fit in any of the groups currently recognized by meteorite classification. Some ataxites belong to the IAB group and fall into the sHL (high-Au, low-Ni subgroup), sLH (low-Au, high-Ni subgroup), sHH (high-Au, high-Ni subgroup) and \\"ung\\" subgroup (does not fit any subgroup of IAB). Only a couple of ataxites have been classified into the IAB complex and the IIF, IVA, IIAB, IIIAB groups. Abundance They are a rare class, with none of the about 50 observed iron meteorite falls being an ataxite, however, the largest meteorite ever, the Hoba meteorite (found 1920 in Namibia, weight 60 tons), belongs to this class. A Tibetan Buddhist statue, the Iron Man, was likely carved from an ataxite meteorite. It might even be made from a fragment of the Chinga meteorite.

The station is on the Exeter to Plymouth line, down the line from and measured from via . From here to Teignmouth the railway runs along the Sea Wall. History The first footbridge, built in 1873 No station was provided between Starcross and Dawlish until the summer of 1905 when Warren Halt was opened by the Great Western Railway. This was not on the site of the present station, but nearer to the Sea Wall by the footbridge which had been built across the line in 1873. The original long platforms were lengthened to for the next summer to allow longer trains to call. From 1 July 1907 the station was provided with offices and staff and was therefore renamed Warren Platform. It received its final name of \\"Dawlish Warren\\" on 1 October 1911. Work soon started on a new station. A goods yard was opened on 10 June 1912 on the landward side of the line, and the new station, now nearer to Starcross, was opened to passengers on 23 September 1912. The platforms were now long. The building on the 'Down' platform (nearest the beach) was destroyed by fire on 9 January 1924. Modern Camping coach Bristol In 1935 a camp coach was stationed in the goods yard which could be rented by holiday makers but the facility was withdrawn in 1939. Camping coaches were reintroduced by the Western Region in 1952, and by 1963 there were nine coaches stationed here. After 1964 the public camp coach service was withdrawn but the coaches at Dawlish Warren continued to be managed by the British Rail Staff Association for its members. The old coaches were replaced for the 1982 season by the current vehicles, since when the connection to the goods yard has been removed. The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. Goods traffic was withdrawn on 5 August 1967 and on 3 May 1971 the station became unstaffed. From 1974 to 1984 the buildings on the Up side housed the Dawlish Warren Railway Museum with its model railway. This building too burnt down in 2003, but in 2007 a new residential building was built on the site which is outwardly the same design as the former Dawlish Warren signal box. This had been located at the north end of the 'Down' platform until made redundant on 14 November 1986 by the West of England resignalling; it was demolished in May 1990. Description There are four tracks through the station with platforms on the outer pair which allows fast trains to overtake trains stopped at the station. Trains towards Dawlish use the platform nearest the beach, which is only a few yards away. The station has step-free access to both platforms. A narrow and low bridge beneath the line immediately south of the station allows access between the platforms. Behind the platform used by trains towards Paignton is a golf course and the salt marsh and dunes that make up the Dawlish Warren National Nature Reserve. Services A First Great Western service to Paignton First Great Western Intercity 125 passing through. Dawlish Warren is served by Great Western Railway trains in both directions on an approximately hourly basis during the day. Most trains run between Exmouth and Paignton; on Sundays the service is less frequent and most trains only run between Exeter St Davids and Paignton. The route from Exeter St Davids through Dawlish Warren to Paignton is marketed as the \\"Riviera Line\\". A few trains run between Bristol & & points west, otherwise passengers travelling east or north change into main line trains at Exeter St Davids or at Newton Abbot if travelling westwards. The outside lines can accommodate an eight-carriage Great Western Railway service, but only selected doors are able to open due to the short platform. CrossCountry trains between the north east and south west pass through Dawlish Warren without stopping, except for 2 northbound services in the morning and 1 southbound service in the afternoon on summer Saturdays only as of the May 2015 timetable. During the weekday timetable, only one direct train from London Paddington calls at Dawlish Warren. This service is the 17:33 London Paddington to Paignton service calling at Dawlish Warren at 20:38. On Summer Saturdays there are three direct services from London Paddington to Paignton calling at Dawlish Warren with three return services. On Sundays there are no services to/from London, passengers to/from London have to change at Exeter St Davids.

Arthropods, lepidoptera, hymenoptera, diptera, and decapoda serve as natural hosts. There are currently 84 species in this family, divided among four genera. Baculoviruses are known to infect invertebrates, with over 600 host species having been described. Immature (larval) forms of moth species are the most common hosts, but these viruses have also been found infecting sawflies, mosquitoes, and shrimp. Although baculoviruses are capable of entering mammalian cells in culture they are not known to be capable of replication in mammalian or other vertebrate animal cells. Starting in the 1940s they were used and studied widely as biopesticides in crop fields. Baculoviruses contain circular double-stranded genome ranging from 80 to 180 kbp. Historical influence The earliest records of baculoviruses can be found in the literature from as early as the sixteenth century in reports of \\"wilting disease\\" infecting silkworm larvae.baculovirus.com Starting in the 1940s the viruses were used and studied widely as biopesticides in crop fields. Since the 1990s they have been employed to produce complex eukaryotic proteins in insect cell cultures (see Sf21, High Five cells). These recombinant proteins have been used in research and as vaccines in both human and veterinary medical treatments (for example, the most widely used vaccine for prevention of H5N1 avian influenza in chickens was produced in a baculovirus expression vector). More recently it has been found that baculoviruses can transduce mammalian cells with a suitable promoter. Baculovirus life cycle alt= The baculovirus life cycle involves two distinct forms of virus. Occlusion derived virus (ODV) is present in a protein matrix (polyhedrin or granulin) and is responsible for the primary infection of the host while the budded virus (BV) is released from the infected host cells later during the secondary infection. Baculoviruses have very species-specific tropisms among the invertebrates with over 700 host species having been described. Immature (larval) forms of moth species are the most common hosts, but these viruses have also been found infecting sawflies, mosquitoes, and shrimp. Typically, the initial infection occurs when a susceptible host insect feeds on plants that are contaminated with the occluded form of the virus. The protein matrix dissolves in the alkaline environment of the host midgut (stomach), releasing ODV that then fuse to the columnar epithelial cell membrane of the host intestine and are taken into the cell in endosomes. Nucleocapsids escape from the endosomes and are transported to nucleus. This step is possibly mediated by actin filaments. Viral transcription and replication occur in the cell nucleus and new BV particles are budded out from the basolateral side to spread the infection systemically. During budding, BV acquires a loosely fitting host cell membrane with expressed and displayed viral glycoproteins. Baculovirus dispersal pathways in the environment Baculovirus infection can be divided to three distinct phases: * Early (0–6 h post-infection), * Late (6–24 h p.i.) * Very late phase (18–24 to 72 h p.i.) While BV is produced in the late phase, the ODV form is produced in the very late phase acquiring the envelope from host cell nucleus and embedded in the matrix of occlusion body protein. These occlusion bodies are released when cells lyse to further spread baculovirus infection to next host. The extensive lysis of cells frequently causes the host insect to literally disintegrate, thus the reason for the historic name \\"wilting disease.\\" The complete ODV-polyhedrin particles are resistant to heat and light inactivation, whereas the naked BV virion is more sensitive to environment. When infecting a caterpillar, the advanced stages of infection cause the host to feed without resting, and then to climb to the higher parts of trees, including exposed places they would normally avoid due to the risk of predators. This is an advantage for the virus if (when the host dissolves) it can drip down onto leaves which will be consumed by new hosts. Structure of the virion thumb The most studied baculovirus is Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). The virus was originally isolated from the alfalfa looper (a lepidopteran) and contains a 134-kbp genome with 154 open reading frames (ORF). The major capsid protein VP39 together with some minor proteins forms the nucleocapsid (21 nm x 260 nm) that encloses the DNA with p6.9 protein. BV acquires its envelope from the cell membrane and requires a glycoprotein, gp64, to be able to spread systemic infection. This protein forms structures called peplomers on one end of the budded virus particle but is not found on ODV (although several other proteins are only associated with the ODV form). Some differences also exist in the lipid composition of the viral envelope of the two forms. While the BV envelope consists of phosphatidylserine, ODV contains phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. A nucleocapsid assembly-essential element (NAE) was identified in the AcMNPV genome. The NAE is an internal cis-element within the ac83 gene. The nucleocapsid assembly is not dependent on the Ac83 protein product. Major envelope glycoprotein gp64  During periods of evolution, the baculoviral envelope glycoproteins have undergone changes. Ld130, also known as baculovirus F-protein from Lymantria dispar (LdMNPV) is suggested to be an ancestral envelope fusion protein which has been replaced by non- orthologous gene replacement with gp64 in AcMNPV, Bombyx mori (BmNPV) and Orgyia pseudotsugata (OpMNPV) while they still retain the ld130 gene. Gp64 is a homotrimeric membrane glycoprotein which is polarly present on the rod- shaped virion. It consists of 512 amino acids (aa) with four glycosylation sites at asparagine residues and has a N-terminal signal sequence (20 aa), oligomerization and fusion domain and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain near the C-terminus (7 aa). It is produced in both early and late phases of the infection cycle with a maximal rate of synthesis occurring in 24–26 h p.i.. Trimerization with intermolecular cysteine-bonds seems to be a crucial step for protein transport to cell surface, since only 33% of synthesized protein reaches cell surface as monomeric gp64 is degraded within the cells. Gp64 is essential for efficient budding of the virion and for the cell-to-cell transmission during the infection cycle as well as viral entry i.e. causing viral trophism and endosome mediated uptake to the cell. The major function of the gp64 envelope protein is to cause the pH-mediated envelope fusion to the endosome. Although gp64 has variety of essential functions, it has been reported that gp64-null baculoviruses can be substituted with other viral glycoproteins such as Ld130, G-protein of Vesicular stomatitis virus. These substitutions will result in functional virons. Applications Baculovirus expression in insect cells represents a robust method for producing recombinant glycoproteins or membrane proteins. Baculovirus-produced proteins are currently under study as therapeutic cancer vaccines with several immunologic advantages over proteins derived from mammalian sources. Biosafety Baculoviruses are incapable of replicating within the cells of mammals and plants.Ignoffo CM. (1975) Baculoviruses for Insect Pest Control: Safety Considerations, Summers M, Engler R, Falcon LA, Vail PV (eds.) American Society for Microbiology, Washington DC, p52 They have a restricted range of hosts that they can infect that is typically restricted to a limited number of closely related insect species. Because baculoviruses are not harmful to humans, they are considered a safe option for use in research applications. They are also used as biological agents as in the case of the Indian mealmoth, a grain-feeding pest. Taxonomy The name of this family has been derived from the latin word baculus, meaning stick. The family has been divided into four genera: Alphabaculovirus (lepidopteran-specific nucleopolyhedroviruses), Betabaculovirus (lepidopteran-specific Granuloviruses), Gammabaculovirus (hymenopteran-specific nucleopolyhedroviruses) and Deltabaculovirus (dipteran- specific nucleopolyhedroviruses).

Indirect grilling is a barbecue cooking technique in which the food is placed to the side of or above the heat source instead of directly over the flame as is more common. This can be achieved by igniting only some burners on a gas barbecue or by piling coals to one side of a charcoal pit. A drip tray is placed below the food to prevent fat from the food igniting and generating a direct flame. Indirect grilling is designed to cook larger (e.g. pork shoulders, whole chicken) or tougher foods (e.g. brisket, ribs) that would burn if cooked using a direct flame. This method of cooking generates a more moderate temperature (about 275–350 °F) and allows for an easier introduction of wood smoke for flavoring. While placing the food to one side of the fire places the food further from the heat source and thus reduces the intensity of the radiation, the food is still exposed to direct radiation from the fire. Other variations of indirect grilling place a physical barrier between the food and the fire. One method is to place a plank or an unperforated tray on the grill as a base upon which to cook. If the plank is made from wood and is soaked before grilling, the wood can then be used to impart flavor to the food. Another method of indirect grilling is to place a physical barrier such as a pizza stone between the fire and the food. The heat rises from the fire around the edges of the barrier and then circulates around the food. Most brands of kamado style outdoor cookers have accessories known as heat deflectors which can be placed above the fire and below the food grate. In the 1990s it became popular to stand a chicken on an open can of beer or other canned beverage inserted into the cavity when indirect grilling, a preparation known as \\"beer can chicken\\". Some believe that the contents of the can boil and flavor the food with the consequent vapor, however rigorous tests have invoked skepticism on this point.  Plank cooking  One method of plank cooking salmon steaks. Plank cooking, also referred to as planking, is the technique of roasting or baking food, usually fish or meat, on wooden planks. Several cultures around the world did this in their pre-modern traditional cuisine. The Finnish dish loimulohi (\\"blazing salmon\\") is an example of this, while in North America the Northwest Coast Indians used predominately Western Red Cedar planks to cook Pacific species of salmon. Planks can be put directly over open flames, or stood on edge and faced towards the flames (the Finnish method), either method infuses the food with the natural oils and moisture found in the woods adding flavor. Since the 1990s professional chefs in North America have experimented with expanding the list of foods prepared on planks beyond salmon and wild meats, to also include a variety of meats, poultry, vegetables, cheese, fruits and even pizza. For years, restaurants have kept the tradition alive by serving salmon cooked on planks. But more recently, as pre-cut boards have become widely available, chefs and home cooks across the continent have been experimenting with cooking on planks. Besides roasting over an open flame, planking can also be used in an oven, for breads and pastries as well as savoury dishes. Plank cooking has been the subject of parody.

It is also referred to as an overhead. A smash can usually be hit with a high amount of force and is often a shot that ends the point. Most smashes are hit fairly near the net or in mid-court before the ball bounces, generally against lobs that have not been hit high enough or deep enough by the opponent. A player can also smash a very high ball from the baseline, generally on the bounce, although this is often a less forceful smash. Smash commonly refers to the forehand smash; backhand smashes are rarer and more difficult to execute, especially for beginners, since they are basically high backhand volleys generally hit at an exact angle causing the ball to spin. Rod Laver and Jimmy Connors, both left-handers, were known for their very powerful backhand smashes. The forehand smash was first used in Tennis by Helena Rice on championship point in the 1890 Wimbledon Championships final. In his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, who had a fine overhead himself, devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He writes: \\"OVERHEAD—Schroeder just tops here, ahead of Rosewall and Newcombe. Grip and action The grip used for a tennis smash is usually a continental grip although some players use an Eastern grip. The swing is an upward throwing motion, making the execution of the shot almost identical to a serve. The main difference from a serve is position and footwork. The positioning and footwork are more similar to a volley which is usually hit with a strong forward weight transfer from inside the court. The smash can be executed with one or both feet on the ground. Jimmy Connors invented and popularized the skyhook, a version of the overhead smash in which the Eastern grip used to hit the ball further behind the body than is possible with a traditional overhead smash. Pete Sampras (and before him Yannick Noah) popularized the jump smash, where the player jumps and then hits the smash in mid-air. The shot is often also called a slam dunk, as in basketball.

Although a correct lock can be implemented with test-and-set, it can lead to resource contention in busy lock (caused by bus locking and cache invalidation when test-and-set operation needs to access memory atomically). To lower the overhead a more elaborate locking protocol test and test-and-set is used. The main idea is to reduce writeback that can create resource contention when two separate threads want the same lock. If n threads are competing for the lock, they will attempt to acquire it as soon as it is released if only using test and set, causing each thread to invalidate the lock flag, meaning it must be propagated through the cache of the remaining processors n times, before any one thread may safely read it. By adding the check-yield step, only the first thread of execution to notice the lock is free will attempt to obtain it, eliminating the writeback. boolean locked := false // shared lock variable procedure EnterCritical() { do { while (locked  true) yield(); // lock looks busy so yield to scheduler } while TestAndSet(locked) // actual atomic locking } procedure TestAndSet(lock) { boolean initial = lock; lock = true; return initial; } Exit protocol is: procedure ExitCritical() { locked := false } The entry protocol uses normal memory reads to spin, waiting for the lock to become free. Test-and-set is only used to try to get the lock when normal memory read says it's free. Thus the expensive atomic memory operations happen less often than in simple spin around test-and-set. If the programming language used supports short-circuit evaluation, the entry protocol could be implemented as: procedure EnterCritical() { while ( locked  true or TestAndSet(locked)  true ) skip // spin until locked } Caveat Although this optimization is useful in system programming it should be avoided in high level concurrent programming unless all constraints are clear and understood.

He first came to fame playing the role of Billy Walker, wayward son of publican Annie, in ITV's long-running soap opera, Coronation Street. Following a brief period as a film actor, Farrington secured the role of Tom King in Emmerdale. After the character's high-profile death in December 2006, Farrington retired as an actor. Personal life Farrington was born in Dulwich, South London, and attended Alleyn's School. He was married to actress Patricia Heneghan from 1961 to 1981; they have two children. He was taught by Michael Croft, who advised him not to take up acting as a professional. Career (1960–2000) Farrington's first major role was as Jack Marvel in the 1960 series, The Splendid Spur, but he came to prominence playing the role of Billy Walker, wayward son of publican Annie, in ITV's long-running soap opera, Coronation Street, having previously been considered for the role of Jed Stone. He joined the series in 1961, continuing in the role on and off until leaving the show for good in 1984. Farrington played long-suffering Chief Inspector Teal's right-hand man in the TV series The Saint, and also appeared in episodes of The Avengers, Redcap and Z-Cars. He appeared in films such as Submarine X-1 (1968) and Party Party (1983). Farrington worked with the Manchester Drama Group, with whom cast members of Coronation Street often performed in the 1970s. In 1974, he directed Anne Kirkbride in a lunchtime production of David Halliwell's Muck from Three Angles at the Grapes Hotel in Quay Street.Simon Farquhar \\"Anne Kirkbride: 'Coronation Street' stalwart across five decades entrusted with some of its most dramatic storylines\\", The Independent, 20 January 2015 Kirkbride's character in the soap, Deirdre, was a love interest of Billy Walker around this time. Beginning in 1997 he played the continuing role of Jack Gates, father of Hart family matriarch Annie Hart (played by Liz Crowther), in the soap opera Family Affairs. His character was killed off in late 1998 (several weeks prior to the entire Hart family being killed off) as part of a drastic revamp of that series. Emmerdale (2004–2006) In 2004, Farrington joined the ITV soap opera Emmerdale, playing the character Tom King. After three years in the role, he announced his departure on 8 August 2006. Speaking about his decision to quit the show, Farrington said: \\"I originally came to Emmerdale for just six months and I have ended up staying for three years. Even during my 25 years at Coronation Street, two years at a time was my longest stint.

It concerned the nature of the right to a fair trial and under what circumstances indigent defendants (who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay in most circumstances in which an accused is unrepresented. It is an important case in Australian criminal law and in Australian constitutional law since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.  Background  On 17 December 1986, the accused, the career criminal Olaf Dietrich (born 1952), flew from Bangkok, Thailand, to Melbourne Airport. He had imported at least 70 g of heroin, which he concealed within condoms that he had swallowed. He was arrested the next morning by the Australian Federal Police, who searched his flat and found one of the condoms in the kitchen/and some heroin in a plastic bag under a rug in another room. He was taken into custody/and excreted the remaining condoms during the night at the hospital in Pentridge Prison. Dietrich alleged that the drugs had been planted by the police. Dietrich was tried in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a trafficking offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges. During the lengthy trial, the accused had no legal representation. Although he had applied to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, it said that it would help him only if he pleaded guilty, an option that Dietrich did not want to take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge, the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to what was involved in the first three charges, he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. per Gaudron J at [10] \\"After a trial lasting several weeks, Mr Dietrich was convicted on the first charge and, notwithstanding the difficulties inherent in the defence case, acquitted on the fourth. No verdicts were taken on the second and third charges, for... they were alternative to the first\\". Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, which refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.  Arguments  In his High Court appeal, Dietrich was represented by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice since he did not have legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense because of the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial. Mugshot of Hugo Rich, formerly known as Olaf Dietrich, on his arrest on 12 May 2005 = The right to a fair trial = Dietrich suggested three different sources in law for the right to counsel that he asserted. The first was section 397 of the Victorian Crimes Act 1958 (now repealed), which provided that \\"every accused person shall be admitted after the close of the case for the prosecution to make full answer and defence thereto by legal practitioner\\". However, the court found that the provision means only that an accused is entitled to counsel paid for by that person or someone else, not counsel provided by the state. The second source that Dietrich proposed was Australia's obligations under international law, particularly under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which Australia is a signatory. Article 14(3) of the Covenant provides that an accused should have legal assistance provided \\"in any case where the interests of justice so require\\". Article6 of the European Convention of Human Rights to which Australia is not a party also guarantees that defendants to be provided with legal aid \\"when the interests of justice so require\\". Australia has not incorporated the ICCPR into its domestic law with any specific legislation, unlike some other international treaties, such as World Heritage treaties (see Commonwealth v Tasmania). However, Dietrich argued that the common law of Australia should be developed in accordance with the principles in the ICCPR, as well as other international treaties to which Australia is a party. That is the approach used in the United Kingdom, in relation to decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, for example. However, the court pointed out that the practice was usually done in relation to interpreting legislation, and in this case, the court was being asked \\"to declare that a right which has hitherto never been recognised should now be taken to exist.\\" The third source that Dietrich suggested was a group of similar cases in other common law countries such as the United States and Canada. In the United States, the right to counsel was guaranteed in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, part of the United States Bill of Rights. The Amendment says that \\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence\\". However, that did not necessarily mean that counsel had to be provided by the state. In the case of Powell v. Alabama in 1932, the US Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to defendants in capital trials, with capital punishment being a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own counsel. In Johnson v. Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded that principle to cover all federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to state courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, the court has affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation after they have been arrested (Miranda v. Arizona), and for line-ups (United States v. Wade). In Canada, Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right \\"to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right\\", and Canadian case law has found that as a corollary of that right, there is a right to legal aid. Although it is common for Australian courts to acknowledge developments in other common law countries, including the United States and Canada, the law in those countries on the right to counsel is based on particular provisions of the Constitutions or Bills of Rights of those countries. Australia had no such provisions of rights in either the Constitution or in legislation. In taking that into account, it was argued by the court: The High Court also examined a number of related propositions. In particular, it pointed out that when interpreting the legislation which established legal aid services, Australian courts did not recognise an absolute right to counsel in all circumstances and so the state does not need to provide counsel for the duration of the trial. The court also raised the question of what a right to counsel would actually mean in practice: would a right to counsel at public expense entitle a person to counsel of a certain degree of experience? Furthermore, the court suggested that having a right to representation would necessarily imply that a trial conducted without the accused being legally represented would necessarily be unfair, which has been rejected by the Australian courts. The accused must have lost a \\"real chance of acquittal\\" before a trial can be regarded as unfair. Essentially, Australian common law recognised a right to a fair trial, but the question of whether the lack of representation caused an unfair trial had to be based on the particular circumstances of each case. = Miscarriage of justice = Dietrich's other argument was that the trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself and that the failure to do so caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was in the interests of the community for the matter to be dealt with promptly. The High Court said that the trial judge did not seem to be aware that he had the authority to adjourn the trial. per Mason CJ & McHugh J at [38] \\"In fact, the trial judge did not seem to be aware of the discretionary power he enjoyed; rather than just failing to take into account some material consideration or giving undue weight to one or another factor, his Honour virtually overlooked the possibility of adjourning the matter on the basis suggested\\". Another factor that complicated the case was that although the jury found Dietrich guilty of importing the heroin in the condoms, it found him not guilty of owning the heroin which had been hidden in a plastic bag. For the High Court, that uncertainty meant that it was possible that Dietrich could also have been acquitted of the other charges if he had been legally represented: Significantly, the possibility that Dietrich may have been acquitted differentiates the case from the unsuccessful 1979 McInnis v R. appeal. McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction by arguing that the failure to adjourn the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, the majority in the McInnis appeal found that McInnis was very unlikely to have been acquitted, even with full representation. That was clearly not the case with Dietrich.  Judgment  The majority in the High Court decided that although there was no right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, some cases make representation appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a trial judge should use the power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel. Two of the judges, Deane and Gaudron JJ, went further and suggested that the right to representation in some circumstances is founded in the Constitution. They claimed that Chapter III of the Constitution, which represents the Judicature with the notion of separation of powers and vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, requires judicial process and fairness to be observed. Another two judges, Brennan and Dawson JJ, dissented, Brennan J argued that it would not be proper for judges to use their power to adjourn trials to put pressure on the various legal aid agencies to change their decisions. As a result of the majority decision, the court ordered the application to appeal to be granted, the conviction be quashed and Dietrich to be granted a new trial.  Consequences  The case reinvigorated debate about who should be provided with legal aid and raised the possibility that those charged with serious offences could escape conviction if legal aid was not provided. That placed pressure on the legal aid authorities to fund those cases and fears emerged that they would need to pull funds from other cases to meet the new demands, especially when faced with \\"complex criminal cases\\" that may entail high costs over extended periods of time. Although there are no precise figures about the effect of the decision on legal aid budgets, a Senate inquiry agreed that the decision had the potential to divert legal aid funding towards criminal cases, at the expense of civil or family law matters. Among the solutions to those problems were proposals for the state legal aid commissions to maintain \\"emergency funds\\" that could be used in major criminal cases; the South Australian Criminal Law (Legal Representation) Act 2002, which was designed to allow the courts to seize a defendant's assets to prevent false claims under the Dietrich principle; and the introduction of legislation in the Parliament of Victoria amending the Crimes Act 1958 to allow judges to directly order for legal aid funding to be granted, rather than simply ordering a stay. = Olaf Dietrich = Although the High Court ordered for the verdict of the conviction to be overturned and for a retrial to be conducted, there was never any retrial since Dietrich had already served his sentence. Dietrich was released on parole in July 1990, and he subsequently changed his name by deed poll to Hugo Rich. In 1995, he was convicted of three armed robberies and jailed for 13 years. Upon appeal, two of those convictions were quashed and retrials were ordered, and a third was upheld. Only one of these counts was retried, and once again, a guilty verdict was returned. In 2001, he was eligible for day leave, and he gained media attention by leaving the decision as to whether or not he should be allowed to do so up to the readers of the Herald Sun. A poll conducted by that newspaper returned a convincing \\"no\\". After his release in October 2004, he once again faced court for firearms charges and then for the murder of security guard Erwin Kastenberger during an armed robbery in on 8March 2005. He was found guilty of the murder of Kastenberger in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 12 June 2009, and he was subsequently jailed for life with a non-parole period of 30 years. In 2014 the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal..  See also  * Gideon v.

Rustington is approximately at the midpoint of the West Sussex coast and midway between the county town of Chichester and Brighton. The A259 runs along the north of Rustington, westward to Littlehampton, Bognor Regis and Chichester, and east to Worthing and Brighton. With a population of over 14,000 in 2014, it has the size and facilities of a small town, including a shopping area with a mix of independent and chain stores. The parish of Rustington includes the neighbourhood of West Preston. History Rustington was in World War I home to an American air base, to the east of the High Street. Intended to launch bombing raids against Germany, the airfield was incomplete when the war ended. Conservation area and information centre Rustington contains a conservation area which extends from the south end of North Lane to The Lamb in The Street. Here, where trees are protected, are the largest number of pre-1850 listed buildings in the post town, with The Street and surrounding roads containing some of the finest 17th and 18th century Sussex flint cottages in West Sussex, some of which are thatched. There is a village information centre at the Broadmark Lane car park, housed in the recently renovated WRVS building in the Waitrose car park. It also houses Rustington Museum, exploring the village's history from the Stone Age to the modern day with artefacts from throughout time. Annual events Rustington competes annually in the South-East in Bloom competition. It holds an annual carnival and fête in August. Close to Christmas Eve, Rustington has a village carol concert which is free for local residents and features local school children accompanied by the Littlehampton Concert Band.

It is known for containing amygdalin, a poisonous compound. Together with the related synthetic compound laetrile, amygdalin has been marketed as an alternative cancer treatment. However, studies have found the compounds to be ineffective in the treatment of cancer, as well as potentially toxic or lethal when taken by mouth, due to cyanide poisoning. Apricot kernels can cause potentially fatal cyanide poisoning when consumed. Symptoms include nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, increased thirst, lethargy, nervousness, various aches and pains in joints and muscles, and a drop in blood pressure. The kernel is an economically significant byproduct of fruit processing and the extracted oil and resulting press cake have value. Apricot kernels are sometimes added to soaps or scrubs as an exfoliant. In 1993 the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets tested the cyanide content of two (8 oz) packages of bitter apricot kernels imported from Pakistan that were being sold in health-food stores as a snack. The results showed that each package, if consumed entirely, contained at least double the minimum lethal dosage of cyanide for an adult human; the product was removed from stores.Imported Bitter Apricot Pits Recalled as Cyanide Hazard By DENNIS HEVESI Published: Friday, March 26, 1993 – The New York Times There was one reported case in the medical literature of cyanide toxicity from apricot kernels from 1979 to 1998 in the United States, a non-fatal poisoning by purchased apricot kernels.

It is down the line from and measured from via . The station is built on the sea wall, as is the railway line, and has often suffered from storm damage due its proximity to the sea. South of the station the line passes through five tunnels through the cliffs as it follows the coast. History Dawlish in the 1870s with the station and chimney for the atmospheric pumping engine in the right background. The station was opened by the South Devon Railway on 30 May 1846. The wall with bricked up windows that can be seen in the car park is the remains of the engine house that used to power the trains while they were worked by atmospheric power from 13 September 1847 until 9 September 1848. At this time it was one of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's broad gauge railways. The station initially had just one platform on the landward side with a loop line closer to the sea, but a second platform was added to serve the loop line on 1 May 1858. The original wooden station and train shed was burnt down on 14 August 1873. The South Devon Railway built a new station with the platforms connected by an iron bridge, roofed with glass. The principal buildings were constructed adjoining Station Road, and the booking office was fitted with pitch pine cornice and fittings. Star gas pendent lights were installed, and a lift for taking up luggage to the platform levels. The first-class waiting rooms were furnished with Brussels carpets and polished oak furniture. The contractor was Blatchford and Son of Tavistock and the cost was £4,000 (). The new station was re-opened on 12 April 1875. An unusual feature of the section of line running towards Teignmouth was the sudden 'dip' in the track that once existed, resulting from the demand by a local resident who did not wish to lose his view of the sea. This is noticeable in the photograph above. The South Devon Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway on 1 February 1876, and on 20 May 1892 the line was converted to standard gauge. The Great Western in turn was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. The platforms have been extended several times to cope with the crowds and now nearly reach Coastguards' Footbridge, although the Exeter platform was shortened again in 1970. The decorative iron and glass canopies above the platforms were replaced by concrete beams and glass panels in 1961 but the glass has since been replaced by Perspex. Goods traffic was withdrawn on 17 May 1965. =1921 accident= On 22 September 1921 a Plymouth to passenger train collided with an to goods train that was shunting in the station. The passenger train, hauled by Star Class 4055 Princess Sophia, failed to stop at a danger signal. Cranes cleared the line by lifting damaged wagons onto the beach, where they remained for a couple of days. =2014 sea wall breach= On the night of 4 February 2014, amid high winds and extremely rough seas, part of the sea wall at Dawlish was breached, washing away around of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind. The line was closed.

So as to fit on the narrow platform the brick-built lower storey which contained the interlocking equipment was narrower than usual, with the upper storey was vaulted out from this to give a full size operating floor. After the summer of 1970 the signal box was only opened on summer weekends or if there were problems working along the sea wall. It finally closed on 27 September 1986 since when the trains have been controlled from Exeter. Despite attempts to find a commercial use for the redundant building, it remained empty until 2013 when it was demolished during the period 2–5 July. Description View from the south end of the platform The station is adjacent to the beach near the gardens at the centre of the town. The main frontage is in banded rusticated masonry. The remaining walls are rendered except for the east elevation, which faces the sea, which is in rubble stone. It has two storeys as the railway runs above street level and a café occupies most of the street frontage. The main entrance is at road level on the side served by trains to Exeter. This opens onto a booking office with an ornate ceiling from where a flight of stairs lead up to the Exeter platform, but step-free access can be obtained through a gate from the car park beside the station buildings, which is the only access route when the booking office is closed. Access to the opposite platform is by way of a covered footbridge, the stairways of which are contained within the building. Passengers who cannot use the steps can be escorted across the barrow crossing at the south end of the station by the station staff. Immediately to the south of the station is the low Colonnade Viaduct, which carries the railway above the small river that runs through the gardens and the main footpath from the town to the beach and the South West Coast Path. To the north of the station is Coastguards Footbridge, with Coastguards Cottage, now a café, on the hill above the line to the west, and Brunel's Boat House between the line and the beach to the east. The station buildings are Grade II listed.

It was founded by Amanullah Khan, with Maqbool Bhat also credited as a co-founder. Originally a militant wing of the Plebiscite Front, it changed its name to JKLF in Birmingham, England on 29 May 1977. From then until 1994 it was an active militant organisation. It first established branches in several cities and towns of the UK, and other countries of Europe, United States and Middle East. In 1982, it established a branch in Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir; in 1987, a branch in Indian-administered Kashmir Valley. After 1994, the JKLF in Kashmir Valley, under the leadership of Yasin Malik, declared an 'indefinite ceasefire' and reportedly disbanded its military wing. It committed itself to a political struggle for achieving its objective of independence for the entire region of the former princely state. The JKLF branch in Azad Kashmir did not agree with this change of direction and split off from the JKLF in the Valley. In 2005, the two groups merged again retaining the original identity. Even though the JKLF has only Muslim members, it is notionally secular. It continues to assert that a secular, independent Kashmir free of both India and Pakistan is its eventual goal.Pakistan: Activites [sic] of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), UNHCR,2003-08-07 Despite having received weapons and training from Pakistani military, it regards Pakistan as an 'occupation power' and carries out political struggle against it in Azad Kashmir. The JKLF in the Kashmir Valley was banned by Indian government under anti-terror law in March 2019. History JKLF was founded by Amanullah Khan in Birmingham in June 1976 from the erstwhile UK chapter of the 'Plebiscite Front'. Maqbool Bhat is often credited as being its co-founder. Khan was born in Gilgit, studied in Srinagar and emigrated to Pakistan in 1952. Bhat was born in Kupwara and also emigrated to Pakistan after studying in Srinagar. The duo had earlier formed Jammu Kashmir National Liberation Front (NLF) in the late 1960s, along with Hashim Qureshi. The group carried out the hijacking of Ganga, an Indian Airlines plane flying from Srinagar to Jammu, in January 1971, and diverted it to Lahore. The Pakistan government returned all the passengers and crew to India, and subsequently tried the hijackers and several members of NLF on charges of being Indian agents. Khan was imprisoned in a Gilgit prison during 1970–72, released after protests broke out. Maqbool Bhat was released in 1974, and he crossed over into the Indian-administered Kashmir where he was arrested in a bank robbery. Amanullah Khan moved to England, where he received the enthusiastic support of the British Mirpuri community. The UK chapter of the Plebiscite Front was converted into the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) in May 1977. It also formed an armed wing called the 'National Liberation Army'. Amanullah Khan took charge as the General Secretary of JKLF the following February. With the active support of the British Mirpuris, the group expanded rapidly, setting up branches in Pakistan, Denmark, Holland, Germany, France, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the United States. It organised well-attended conventions in Birmingham (1981) and Luton (1982). In 1979, the JKLF planned to disrupt the international cricket match being played in Srinagar. The visiting Australian team was guarded with high security and no untoward incidents occurred.Test Cricket Tours - Australia to India 1979-80, test-cricket-tours.co.uk, retrieved 31 August 2016. Praveen Swami states that the JKLF made plans to bomb the March 1983 conference of non- aligned meeting in New Delhi and to hijack an airliner from New Delhi, both of which were aborted. After the arrival of Hashim Qureshi in the UK in January 1984, another hijacking was planned. However, on 3 February 1984, members of the National Liberation Army kidnapped the Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre in Birmingham and demanded the release of Maqbool Bhat as ransom. Amanullah Khan was named as the interlocuter. Unfortunately, the kidnappers panicked at the possibility of a police raid and, allegedly upon Amanullah Khan's instructions, shot the diplomat. India executed Maqbool Bhat six days later, turning him into a martyr and giving JKLF the visibility it lacked earlier. A British court convicted two members of the JKLF for the killing of Mhatre. Hashim Quresi and Amanullah Khan were expelled from the UK.  Kashmir insurgency  Amanullah Khan and Hashim Qureshi returned to Pakistan in 1984, establishing the JKLF headquarters at Muzaffarabad. Pakistan under Zia ul-Haq, which was already supporting the Khalistani militants in Punjab, was ready to support an insurgency in Kashmir, and Khan was ready to work with the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Hashim Qureshi, on the other hand, refused and went into exile in Holland. JKLF started political planning and continued till the end of 1987.The Rediff Interview/JKDLF Chief Hashim Qureshi, Rediff News, February 2001. Following the allegedly rigged state election in Jammu and Kashmir in 1987, the disaffected youth of the Kashmir Valley started crossing the Line of Control to Azad Kashmir to obtain arms and training. Khan's JKLF was their natural destination. Scholar Paul Staniland states that the JKLF was \\"reborn\\" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir in this period. It was led by young activists from Srinagar and environs, who crossed into Azad Kashmir for arms and training and returned to Srinagar. Yasin Malik, along with Hamid Sheikh, Ashfaq Wani and Javed Ahmad Mir, formed the core group — dubbed the \\"HAJY\\" group — of the JKLF militants in the Kashmir Valley. The enormity of popular support received for their call for independence surprised them. Within two years, the JKLF in the Valley emerged as the \\"vanguard and spearhead of a popular uprising\\" against the Indian state. The JKLF waged a guerrilla war with the Indian security forces, kidnapping of Rubiya Sayeed, the daughter of Indian Home Minister, and targeting attacks on the government and security officials. In March 1990, Ashfaq Wani was killed in a battle with Indian security forces. In August 1990, Yasin Malik was captured in a wounded condition. He was imprisoned until May 1994. Hamid Sheikh was also captured in 1992 but released by the Border Security Force to counteract the pro-Pakistan guerrillas. By 1992, the majority of the JKLF militants were killed or captured. A pro-independence JKLF was not in Pakistan's interest. Pakistan is believed to have accepted the collaboration with JKLF only as a \\"necessary compromise,\\" because the Islamist groups did not yet have currency in the Kashmir Valley. However, the cadres of Islamist groups were also trained in the JKLF training camps in Azad Kashmir. This quickly led to a dilution of the JKLF's nationalist ideology. Independence and Islam became interchangeable slogans. The Islamist attacks that ensued on Kashmiri Pandits, liberal women in general, liquor shops and beauty parlours were never condemned by the JKLF. According to Hasim Qureshi, such outrages were \\"official Pakistan policy\\" and the policy was endorsed by the Islamic Right as well as the Amanullah Khan's JKLF. \\"The ISI ran this movement on communal lines right from the beginning,\\" said Qureshi, \\"and for that Amanullah and his underlings became its agents.\\" Transition to peaceful struggle By 1992, the majority of the JKLF militants were killed or captured and they were yielding ground to pro-Pakistan guerilla groups such as the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, strongly backed by the Pakistani military authorities. Further encroachment by pan-Islamist fighters infiltrating into the Valley from Pakistan changed the colour of the insurgency. Pakistan ceased its financial support to the JKLF because of its pro-independence ideology. After release from prison on bail in May 1994, Yasin Malik declared an indefinite ceasefire of the JKLF. However, according to him, JKLF still lost a hundred activists to Indian operations. Independent journalists mentioned three hundred activists were killed. They were said to have been compromised by Hizb-ul-Mujahideen members, who informed their whereabouts to the security forces. Malik's call for peaceful struggle was unacceptable to Amanullah Khan, who removed him as the president of JKLF. In return, Malik expelled Khan from the chairmanship. Thus JKLF had split into two factions. The Pakistan government recognised Yasin Malik as the leader of JKLF, which further complicated the situation. Ellis and Khan state that, during the Azad Kashmir elections in 1996, JKLF commanded more support than all the traditional parties, even though it was not allowed to contest elections due to its pro- Independence stance. Splits and reunification The JKLF split into two factions after the group based in Indian-administered Kashmir led by Yasin Malik publicly renounced violence in 1995. Their counterparts in Pakistan- administered Kashmir, led by Amanullah Khan refused to do so, thereby precipitating a split in the party.Samii, Cyrus. Seizing the Moment in Kashmir. SAIS Review vol 26, no. 1. Since 1995, Yasin Malik has renounced violence and calls for strictly peaceful methods to come to a settlement on the Kashmir issue. Yasin Malik also considers the Hindu Kashmiris, about 400,000 Hindus who were driven out of Kashmir after violent attacks by the separatists presently staying in refugee camps in Jammu and other Indian cities, to be an integral part of Kashmiri society and has insisted on their right of return. Yasin Malik said, > \\"We want our Kashmiri Pandit mothers, sisters and brothers to come back. It > is their land. They have every right to live in it as we do. This is the > time that Kashmiri Muslims must play a constructive role so that we can > restore the culture for which we are famous all over the world.\\" In 2002, in an interview to Reuters, Amanullah Khan blamed Pakistani backed non-Kashmiri Muslim militants for having harmed his cause. > \\"I've been saying for the last two to three years that (non-Kashmiri > militants) are changing the Kashmir freedom struggle into terrorism.\\" After the December 2001 attack on Indian Parliament, Amanullah's name figured in the list of 20 wanted terrorists India provided to Pakistan to be extradited for various terrorism-related offences. In January 2002, Amanullah Khan offered to surrender to Indian authorities provided an \\"international court issued a verdict against him\\". In 2005, India allowed Yasin Malik to visit Pakistan for the first time. The two leaders, Malik and Khan seized the opportunity to meet each other in Pakistan. In June 2005, a decade after the split, Malik and Khan agreed to reunite the JKLF. The JKLF in Pakistan- administered Kashmir is currently under the leadership of Sardar Saghir Ahmad.Profiles: Political parties, Al Jazeera, 2 August 2011. In December 2005, some senior members of the JKLF separated from Yasin Malik and formed a new JKLF with Farooq Siddiqi (\\"Farooq Papa\\") as its Chairman along with Javed Mir, Salim Nannaji and Iqbal Gundroo, later joined by former militant Bitta Karate. Lately Tahir Mir, former chief of Students Liberation Front, too parted ways with Malik and joined JKLF headed by Farooq Papa. Kashmir watchers think that Yasin Malik's shifting policy of seeking an internal solution with India after its alleged secret meeting with the Prime Minister of India led to the secession of its senior leaders. Farooq Papa supports the involvement of the European Union in resolving the dispute, and has called on EU officials to follow up the visit of an ad hoc European parliament delegation to Kashmir in 2004.

The Neath Canal was opened from Glynneath to Melincryddan, to the south of Neath, in 1795 and extended to Giant's Grave in 1799, in order to provide better shipping facilities. With several small later extensions it reached its final destination at Briton Ferry. No traffic figures are available, but it was successful, as dividends of 16 per cent were paid on the shares. The canal was long and included 19 locks. The Tennant Canal was a development of the Glan-y-wern Canal, which was built across Crymlyn Bog to transport coal from a colliery on its northern edge to a creek on the River Neath called Red Jacket Pill. It closed after 20 years, but was enlarged and extended by George Tennant in 1818, to provide a navigable link from the River Neath to the River Tawe at Swansea docks. In order to increase trade, he built an extension to Aberdulais basin, where it linked to the Neath Canal. The extension was built without an act of Parliament and there was a long delay while Tennant attempted to resolve a dispute with a landowner over the routing of the canal. Once opened, much of the Neath traffic used the Tennant Canal, as Swansea provided better facilities for transferring cargo to ships. Use of the canals for navigation ceased in the 1930s, but they were retained as water channels to supply water to local industries and to Swansea docks. The first attempts at restoration began in 1974 with the formation of the Neath and Tennant Canals Society. The section north of Resolven was restored in the late 1980s, and the canal from Neath to Abergarwed has been restored more recently. This project involved the replacement of Ynysbwllog aqueduct, which carries the canal over the river Neath, with a new plate girder structure, believed to be the longest single- span aqueduct in Britain. Some obstacles remain to its complete restoration. In 2003 a feasibility study was published, suggesting that the canal could become part of a small network, if it was linked through Swansea docks to a restored Swansea Canal. Neath Canal Encouraged by the recent grant of an Act of Parliament to authorise the building of the Glamorganshire Canal, it was resolved at a meeting at the Ship & Castle public house in Neath on 12 July 1790 to build a canal from Pontneddfechan to Neath, and another from Neath to Giant's Grave. Among those attending was Lord Vernon, who had already built a short canal near Giant's Grave to connect the River Neath to furnaces at Penrhiwtyn. Thomas Dadford was asked to survey a course, and he was assisted by his father and brother. He proposed a route which required 22 locks, part of which was a conventional canal, while other parts used the River Neath. Dadford costed the project at £25,716, but in early 1791 Lord Vernon's agent, Lewis Thomas, proposed two new cuts, and the idea of using the river was dropped soon afterwards. The canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament passed on 6 June 1791, which created The Company and Proprietors of the Neath Canal Navigation, who had powers to raise £25,000 by the issue of shares, and an additional £10,000 if necessary. As well as building the canal, the Canal Company could build inclined planes, railways or rollers if required, and could optionally use the bed of the River Neath. The canal was to run from Glynneath (called Abernant at the time), which was not as far up the valley as Pontneddfechan, to Melincryddan Pill at Neath, where it would join the river. Thomas Dadford was employed as Engineer, and construction started from Neath, northwards towards Glynneath. The canal had reached the River Neath at Ynysbwllog by 1792, when Dadford resigned to take up work on the Monmouthshire Canal. He was replaced by Thomas Sheasby, who failed to complete the canal by the November 1793 deadline given to him, and was arrested in 1794 for irregularities in the accounts of the Glamorganshire Canal. The canal company completed the building work by 1795, using direct labour, although the lock into the river was never built. Rebuilding of locks and other improvements continued to be made for several years afterwards. There was no immediate pressure to extend the canal to Giant's Grave, as access to Neath for coastal vessels of up to had been improved in 1791 by the construction of the Neath Navigable Cut. However, a second Neath Canal Act was passed on 26 May 1798, to authorise an extension of about to Giant's Grave, where better facilities for transferring goods to seagoing vessels were available. Thomas Dadford again surveyed the route, but Edward Price from Gofilon acted as engineer. This part of the canal was financed by Lord Vernon, although he was also paid £600 for his Penrhiwtyn canal, which became part of the main line. The extension was completed on 29 July 1799, and terminated at a basin close to Giant's Grave Pill. Flood gates on the canal enabled water to be released into the pill to scour it of silt. The total cost of the project was about £40,000, which included 19 locks and a number of access tramways. Between 1815 and 1842, additional docks and wharfs were built at Giant's Grave, extending the canal slightly, and the canal was extended to Briton Ferry by the construction in 1832 of the Jersey Canal, which was about long, and was built without an Act of Parliament by the Earl of Jersey. Another short extension was made around 1842. The final length of the canal was . From the northern terminus, a tramway connected the canal to iron works at Aberdare and Hirwaun. This was built in 1803, and included an incline just north of Glynneath, which was powered by a high-pressure Trevithick steam engine. The Tappenden brothers had bought into the iron industry in 1802, and built the tramway because of high tolls on the Glamorganshire Canal, but by 1814 they were bankrupt, and had no further connections with the canal. =Operation= Mineral resources near the top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon be useless unless something was done. Trade steadily grew. Three small private branches were built to serve the industries of the valley. Near the top of the canal, a branch was constructed in 1800, which ran towards Maesmarchog, and was connected to collieries by nearly of tramroad. At Aberclwyd, a branch built in 1817 served the Cnel Bach limekiln on the river bank. Below Neath, a branch left the main line at Court Sart to connect to a tramroad serving the collieries at Eskyn. Although there are no figures for the tonnage carried, apart from a mention of 90,000 tons of coal in 1810, receipts increased from £2,117 in 1800 to £6,677 in 1830. Subscribers had paid a total of £107.50 for their shares, and dividends were paid from 1806, rising from £2 in 1806 to £18 in 1840. Based on the receipts, it has been estimated that some 200,000 tons of coal were carried when trade was at its peak, supplemented by iron, ironstone and fire clay. Facilities at Giant's Grave improved, and included jetties to enable ships' ballast to be landed and dumped, rather than being thrown overboard. This latter approach had caused problems at Newport for the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, where ballast had been thrown into the river, and at Cardiff for the Glamorganshire Canal, where it had been thrown into the canal basin. Efforts were also made to improve the facilities at Neath. From 1818, a Harbour Board was established, and banks of copper slag, marked with buoys, were used to confine the channel. This enabled ships of over 300 tons to reach Neath quays on spring tides, although on neap tides Giant's Grave still had to be used. From 1824, when the connection to the Tennant Canal opened, much of the trade crossed the river and passed down the western bank to the port of Swansea. Glan-y-wern Canal The Glan-y-wern Canal was built to connect Richard Jenkins' colliery at Glan-y-wern with the River Neath at Trowman's Hole, an inlet across the mud flats from the main channel of the river Neath, which was later known as Red Jacket Pill. Jenkins obtained a lease to build it from Lord Vernon on 14 August 1788, but died on the same day. Edward Elton took over management of the colliery, and the canal was constructed by 1790, although there was no actual connection to the river. At Red Jacket, cargos were transhipped from the small boats used on the canal to larger vessels in the pill, which was tidal. The canal remained in use for about 20 years. Elton became bankrupt and died in 1810 after which Lord Vernon, who had leased the land on which the canal was built to Elton, placed a distraint on the wharves at Red Jacket and on the barges and it became disused. George Tennant incorporated the southern section into his Tennant Canal. The northern branch over the Crymlyn Bog was derelict by 1918. It branches northwards in Crymlyn Burrows and terminates at the Crymlyn Bog nature reserve, now a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The SSSI covers an area of , and has been designated because of the presence of fen and wet woodland habitats. It is also a RAMSAR site and a Special Area of Conservation. Rare flora and fauna include slender cottongrass, the fen raft spider, and groupings of rare and scarce invertebrates. The Tennant Canal George Tennant, born in 1765 and the son of a solicitor in Lancashire, moved to the area in 1816, after he had bought the Rhydings estate. The Glan-y-wern Canal was unused at the time, following Lord Vernon's distraint, but Tennant, who had no previous experience with canals, decided to lease it, enlarge it and extend it. He planned to make it suitable for barges of , which would gain access to the river Neath through a lock at Red Jacket. Where the canal turned northwards across Crymlyn Bog, he would extend it to the west, to terminate at a lock into the River Tawe, near Swansea harbour. He believed that Swansea docks would provide a better shipping point than Neath or Giant's Grave, and hoped that the canal would encourage the development of the corridor through which it ran. He attempted to gain support for the scheme from local landowners, but when none was forthcoming, he decided to fund the project himself. Lord Vernon's estate had been inherited by the Earl of Jersey in 1814, and so Tennant leased the Glan-y-wern Canal from him. The Tennant Canal, beside the 12th century Neath Abbey Work started in 1817, under the direction of the engineer William Kirkhouse, and the canal was completed by autumn 1818, running from near the east pier on the River Tawe at Swansea to the River Neath at Red Jacket.Neath and Tennant Canals Trust: Tennant Canal History The canal was built to a grander scale than originally intended, and could be navigated by barges of . The main line was long, and the branch to Glan-y-wern was also reopened, for it supplied regular cargoes of coal. Other goods carried included timber, bark, fire-bricks and sand, but the volume of goods carried was not enough to make a profit. He negotiated with the Neath Canal, who gave him permission to build a lock into the river from their canal, either at Giant's Grave or Court Sart pill, but working canal boats across a tidal river would not have been ideal, and he did not build the lock. Aberdulais Tin Works Instead, he decided to build an extension to link up with the Neath Canal basin at Aberdulais. Again he sought support from local landowners, including Lord Jersey, Lord Dynevor and the Duke of Beaufort, but again none was forthcoming. He decided to build it as a private canal, without an Act of Parliament, and work started in 1821. Engineering problems were experienced near Neath Abbey, where a cutting was required through what appeared to be quicksand. Eventually, an inverted masonry arch had to be built to contain the canal and stop the sand collapsing. The lack of an Act to authorise the canal proved to be a problem in April 1821, when L. W. Dillwyn refused permission for Tennant to cut through his land to pass under the Swansea road. In February 1822, Dillwyn obtained an injunction against Tennant, who then attempted to change Dillwyn's opinion by sending a stream of important people to argue his case. Finally, in the autumn, Tennant offered the Neath Canal terms for the use of the junction which were so favourable to them that they accepted. Dillwyn, who was a Neath Canal shareholder, was sent a conciliatory letter and eventually agreed to negotiate with Tennant, whom he described as \\"that terrible plague Mr. Tennant.\\" The final section included the only lock on the main line, which was followed by a ten-arched aqueduct across the River Neath, and the junction with the Neath Canal. The total length of the canal, when it was opened on 13 May 1824, was , and it had cost around £20,000, which did not include the price of the land or of the harbour at Port Tennant. At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats could enter Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His terminus was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was constructed by the Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal water by passing through the dock, and a wharf for the canal was constructed at the eastern end of the dock. Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the dock was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter the dock, even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a lay-by berth was provided on its north side. Sometime before 1876 another branch was built along the south-western edge of the Crymlyn Bog to transport coal from a mine at Tir-isaf. =Operation= Prior to its opening, Tennant estimated that the canal would carry 99,994 tons per year, and generate £7,915 in income. Traffic built up, and by the 1830s, annual tonnage was around 90,000 tons, but revenues were less than anticipated, and produced a profit of about £2,500 per year. Initially, it was known as the Neath and Swansea Junction Canal, but by 1845 it had become known as the Tennant Canal. The water was deep between Red Jacket and Aberdulais, and deep from Red Jacket to Swansea harbour. This provided a large reservoir of water, which was used to scour the tidal basin at Port Tennant. Boats typically carried 25 tons, which allowed them to work on the Neath Canal as well. Several short branches were built, including one to the Vale of Neath Brewery which opened in 1839 and was privately funded by the brewery. In the same year, the Glan-y-wern Canal was dredged and re-opened. Goods carried were mainly coal and culm, but also included timber, iron ore, sand, slag and copper ore, with smaller amounts of foodstuffs and general merchandise. Establishment of industries at Port Tennant, which included Charles Lambert's copperworks in the 1850s and a patent fuel works in the 1860s, resulted in increased traffic of coal, from both Glan-y-wern and Tir-isaf collieries. Tir- isaf was served by a branch built in 1863 by the Earl of Jersey, but leased to the Tennants. Traffic figures reached 225,304 tons in 1866, and then gradually declined after that, but this provided a steady revenue until 1895. The river lock at Red Jacket had a chequered history. Once the line to Aberdulais basin had been opened, it was barely used, and Tennant thought about removing it in 1832. However, it was back in use some time later, and was unused again in the 1880s, only to be rebuilt in 1898. Demise The canals faced competition from the Vale of Neath Railway after 1851, but remained profitable until the early 1880s, in the case of the Neath Canal, and the 1890s for the Tennant. An unusual aspect of the Tennant's success was that tolls were maintained, although tonnage dropped. Most canals at this time made significant cuts to tolls in an attempt to remain competitive with the railways. After 1883, the Neath Canal carried small amounts of silica and gunpowder, but traffic had virtually ceased by 1921. Navigation on the Neath Canal came to an end in 1934, and on the Tennant Canal soon afterwards. However, most of the infrastructure was maintained as the canals supplied water to local industries. When the Glynneath bypass was built in the 1970s, the canal was culverted above Ysgwrfa lock, to allow the road to be straightened, and reduced in width beyond that, to allow the road to be widened. Above Pentremalwed lock, the road was built over the canal bed, and all traces have gone. This road was superseded by the A465 dual carriageway when it opened in 1996, and has become the B4242 road. The part which covered the final section of the canal is no longer a road, although the dual carriageway runs over the site of the Glynneath basin.Ordnance Survey maps, 1:10,560 (1921), 1:10,000 (1983), 1:25,000 (2010) At Port Tennant, the course of the canal has been covered over by railways, roads and other facilities of the port, but continues to supply water to the Prince of Wales dock through a large culvert, which helps to maintain water levels in the docks. The Tennant canal is still owned by the Coombe-Tennant family. Restoration Construction of the west pier to support the new Ynysbwllog aqueduct The completed Ynysbwllog aqueduct, carrying the Neath canal over the river Neath The canals are the subject of active restoration projects. Local interest resulted in the formation of the Neath and Tennant Canals Preservation Society in 1974, to promote restoration of the canal, and carry out clearance and repairs using volunteers. In 2006 it was renamed the Neath and Tennant Canals Trust.Neath and Tennant Canals Trust Newsletter 117, 2006 accessed 19 November 2012 They have worked alongside the two Canal companies, Neath Port Talbot Council, and a wide range of funders and bodies working for regeneration of the Neath valley, to enable significant sections of the canals to return to use.Neath and Tennant Canals Trust Newsletter 138, Dec 2011 accessed 19 November 2012 =North-eastern section= From 1974 to 1990 the canal benefited from job creation schemes run by the Manpower Services Commission and Youth Training Scheme to work on the northern section from Resolven to Ysgwrfa.Neath and Tenant Canals Trust Newsletter 125, Sept 2008 accessed 19 November 2012 By 1990 there was of navigable canal, including 7 restored locks and a slipway at Resolven basin. It received a 1998 Europa Nostra award for the quality of the work, and a Civic Trust Award in 1992. The £4 million project was jointly funded by the Welsh Office and the Prince of Wales Trust. The Rheola aqueduct in the middle of this section was refurbished by the Canals Society in 1990. The stream that is now carried under the canal had previously been carried over it in a cast iron trough, but was diverted through a channel cut across the canal bed after high flows overtopped the trough. This required the construction of a new aqueduct, and once completed, the Canals Society launched their trip boat, named Thomas Dadford, on 12 July 1990, to provide canal trips for the public. The Enfys also provided boat trips for the Enfys Trust from the Tŷ Banc former lock- keepers cottage at Resolven, until 2008. =South-western section= In 1993 the stretch of canal from Abergarwed locks to Tyn-yr-Heol lock at Tonna was polluted when iron-bearing water began discharging from a mine adit of the Ynysarwed coal mine. This turned the water orange, and deposited ferruginous sediment along the canal. A treatment plant and reedbeds were installed to clean the mine water, and this £1.6 million project was commissioned in 1999. In 2000 the Thomas Dadford canal boat was transferred from the northern to the southern section, and began running boat trips from Neath town centre. Initially these could only run as far as Tonna. A £2.7 million project involving staged draining of the polluted sections enabled the dredging and removal of 65,000 tons of polluted sediment, and rebuilding of much of the infrastructure. This extended the navigable section north-east past Aberdulais basin to Lock Machin, a stretch of . Timeline: Canals of the Neath Valley. in Aqueduct 2006 Newsletter of the Neath and Tennant Canals Trust, 2006 accessed 19 November 2012 To extend the canal further to the north-east, a £1.6 million project was funded by the European Union Objective 1 project, the Welsh Assembly and Neath Port Talbot Council. This included complete replacement of the Ynysbwllog aqueduct, part of which had been washed away in a flood in 1979. The commercial role of the canal at that time was to provide water to industries near Swansea, so the water flow had been maintained by replacing the missing arch with pipes. 20 years later a steel footbridge was built to reinstate the towpath. Finally, the canal itself was taken over a new aqueduct, completed in March 2008. The plate girder aqueduct is believed to be the longest single span aqueduct in the UK. It is wide, and includes a footpath on both sides of the navigation channel. A new car park and slipway were provided from the B4242, and the Clun locks were renovated, to give of navigable canal from central Neath to Abergarwen. Following improvements, the towpath between Briton Ferry and Tonna has become a cycle route, in conjunction with Sustrans, the sustainable transport charity. =Plans= The chamber of the newly restored Clun Isaf lock Several obstacles remain before the canal restoration can be completed. To join the two navigable sections a new bridge would be needed where the canal is culverted under Commercial Road, and the infilled section to Abergarwed would need to be excavated. The original bridge at Commercial Road is buried beneath the new embankment, and so there is sufficient headroom available through the embankment without major alterations to the road level. Rebuilding of the two Abergarwed locks and Resolven lock would then create a single stretch of canal some long. Extension to the south is blocked by a bridge at water level in Neath, but in 2009 Neath Port Talbot Council commissioned the Prince's Foundation and British Petroleum to investigate options for the regeneration of the Canal Green area, between the river and the railway line, and the proposals suggested that it should be replaced by a lifting or bascule bridge. The Tennant Canal presents few problems beyond that of the aqueduct below Aberdulais basin, which is a scheduled ancient monument, and rebuilding of the lock below that. Resolution of these issues would create around of navigable canal. At Briton Ferry, the canal ends under the M4 motorway at a scrapyard, but there are plans to refurbish Brunel's Briton Ferry dock, just to the south, and a short extension to it would provide a good terminus. In Neath itself, a masterplan for the Canal Green area, developing both the river frontage and canal sides,Princes Foundation feasibility study for Canal Green Accessed 19 November 2012 has the potential to provide a canal basin and moorings for Neath. At the opposite end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment of the road and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored. At Swansea, the Tennant Canal could be relinked to the Prince of Wales Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, which has become a large marina since the construction of a tidal barrage. This could then provide a link to a restored Swansea Canal. Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, but since then the Prince of Wales Dock has become the subject of a regeneration scheme, and a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this scheme and a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including Crymlyn Bog. The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to the Prince of Wales Dock was again outlined in that report.http://www.trilein.com/links-resources Canals in popular culture The opening of the Tennant Canal in 1824 inspired Elizabeth Davies, who owned a lollipop-shop in Neath, to write a 19-verse poem, which was published by Filmer Fagg of Swansea.

History and Background The Maybourne Hotel Group, formerly The Savoy Hotel Group has been operating super luxury hotels in London with origins that go back 205 years. The group was renamed when the Savoy Hotel was sold off from the original group of four iconic hotels; The Savoy, Claridges, The Berkeley and The Connaught. The oldest hotel in the group is The Connaught which was originally built as the Prince of Saxe Coburg Hotel in 1815The Connaught (hotel). It was renamed The Connaught in 1917 after Queen Victoria's third son, Prince Arthur, the first Duke of Connaught. In December 2019 Maybourne acquired the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills,California and said the acquisition is part of a global expansion strategy bringing Maybourne's European luxury concept to new markets across the globe. Its legacy and heritage make the Maybourne Hotel Group one of the most prestigious and oldest hotel management companies in the world. The Maybourne name was formed when a group of Irish investors headed by Patrick McKillen bought the Savoy group of hotels from Blackstone and Colony Capital in 2003 for £750m. It was decided soon afterwards that the Savoy Hotel did not fit into the plans and was sold to Kingdom Holdings for approximately £250m. As the three remaining hotels were in a very poor state of repair, McKillen immediately set out on a grand plan to completely refurbish the properties beginning with The Connaught. Finance for the purchase of the group was provided by Anglo Irish bank. When the financial crisis hit, Anglo Irish Bank was not able to survive and the group's fully performing loans were transferred to NAMA, a bad bank created by the Government of Ireland in response to the Irish financial crisis. In a controversial move NAMA sold the loans which were the bank's best to the UK's Barclay Brothers while the company was finalising its refinancing away from Irish banks. This gave the Barclay Brothers a once in a lifetime opportunity to launch a hostile attack on the hotel company. The Barclay Brothers owned the Ritz Hotel in London and always nurtured an interest in the three Maybourne hotels. They immediately set a pre-pack administration in motion in an attempt to eliminate McKillen's shares and take over the company. McKillen went to the High Court on the day the attack was launched and succeeded in blocking the takeover attempt. This set in motion the most expensive High Court legal action of its time. The case became extremely bitter between McKillen and the brothers lasting 5 years and costing over £50m. The Barclay Brothers amassed shares from original shareholders in the Maybourne Hotel group which McKillen claimed was illegal. McKillen lost every case in the marathon legal action but effectively wore down the Barclay Brothers and their interest in the company was successfully transferred to the Qatari royal family. McKillen continues to have a substantial investment in the hotel group and personally manages the group on a day-to-day basis. Hotels thumb The Connaught hotel on Carlos Place, Mayfair was closed for a year of restoration in 2008. It was reopened totally restored including a modern wing with 121 rooms, an Aman Spa, an underground swimming pool and a restaurant operated by the famous 2 star Michelin chef, Helene Darroze. Currently, The Connaught trades as one of the world's highest revenue performing hotels, with its suites among the most desirable internationally. The chef, Jean George Vongerichten runs the hotel's all day dining restaurant and also the recently opened Connaught Grill. The Connaught bar has won major international awards including World's Best Bar ( Tales of the Cocktail ) and is currently voted the best bar in Europe ( World's 50 Best 2019 ). thumb Claridges opened in 1898. Designed by CW Stephens, it is located in the heart of Mayfair and became famous for its legendary art deco design. By 2004 Claridge's with its famous Art Deco lobby was also in a poor state of repair. McKillen with the architect Michael Blair won a major planning permission to excavate a five level basement under the hotel by hand. Remarkably the hotel is maintaining normal business while this work is being carried out. The newly created space will provide new amenities and services to significantly improve the guest experience for the next generation. New Spas, swimming pools, a screening room, laundries and bakeries are being created. At the same time, three new floors will be added on the roof providing some of the world's most luxurious rooms and penthouses. These works are due to be completed by 2021. In 2019, the hotel unveiled a new restaurant, Davies and Brook, run by chef Daniel Humm, former holder of World's best restaurant at Eleven Madison Park in New York. The hotel is embarking on an ongoing series of room and suite restorations, recently unveiling a new Royal Suite, an award-winning Empress Eugenie Suite and Prince Alexander Suite. The Berkeley The Berkeley, which was built on its present site in 1972 in Knightsbridge, has been completely renovated over the last few years. In 2017 a major contemporary front facade face lift was unveiled. It was designed by The Pritzker prize winning architect, Lord Rogers. Michelin starred chef Marcus Wareing has his famous restaurant at the Berkeley, and it is home to the award-winning Blue Bar. Hong Kong based Designer Andre Fu completed a series of new pavilion penthouse suites at the hotel in 2018. MONTAGE, BEVERLY HILLS thumb On 20 December 2019 Maybourne acquired Montage Beverly Hills, its first hotel outside London. In 2020, Maybourne will announce further plans for the re-positioning and renovation of Montage Beverly Hills, to bring the hotel more in line with the three London properties. The acquisition is part of a global expansion strategy bringing Maybourne's European luxury concept to new markets across the globe. Christmas Trees The Maybourne Hotel Group are pioneers of bringing bespoke, creatively designed Christmas trees to London. Their most distinguished guests from the fashion/style and art world are invited to design Christmas trees for the hotels and this has become a world famous occasion. The tradition began in 2009 when John Galliano was invited to design the Christmas tree for Claridges. Subsequently, Alber Elbaz, Dolce & Gabbana, Christopher Bailey for Burberry, Jony Ive and Marc Newson, Karl Lagerfeld, Diane Von Furstenberg and Christan Louboutin designed trees. At the Connaught, the Christmas trees has been designed by leading artists from Damien Hirst and Anthony Gormley, to Tracey Emin, Michael Craig Martin and Sean Scully. At The Berkeley, Sir Richard Rogers has created an annual light installation called ‘Snowfall’ that has become a neighbourhood landmark.

For example, the direct sum \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{R} , where \\\\mathbf{R} is real coordinate space, is the Cartesian plane, \\\\mathbf{R} ^2 . To see how direct sum is used in abstract algebra, consider a more elementary structure in abstract algebra, the abelian group. The direct sum of two abelian groups A and B is another abelian group A\\\\oplus B consisting of the ordered pairs (a,b) where a \\\\in A and b \\\\in B. (Confusingly this ordered pair is also called the cartesian product of the two groups.) To add ordered pairs, we define the sum (a, b) + (c, d) to be (a + c, b + d); in other words addition is defined coordinate-wise. A similar process can be used to form the direct sum of any two algebraic structures, such as rings, modules, and vector spaces. We can also form direct sums with any finite number of summands, for example A \\\\oplus B \\\\oplus C, provided A, B, and C are the same kinds of algebraic structures (that is, all groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.). This relies on the fact that the direct sum is associative up to isomorphism. That is, (A \\\\oplus B) \\\\oplus C \\\\cong A \\\\oplus (B \\\\oplus C) for any algebraic structures A, B, and C of the same kind. The direct sum is also commutative up to isomorphism, i.e. A \\\\oplus B \\\\cong B \\\\oplus A for any algebraic structures A and B of the same kind. In the case of two summands, or any finite number of summands, the direct sum is the same as the direct product. If the arithmetic operation is written as +, as it usually is in abelian groups, then we use the direct sum. If the arithmetic operation is written as × or ⋅ or using juxtaposition (as in the expression xy) we use direct product. In the case where infinitely many objects are combined, most authors make a distinction between direct sum and direct product. As an example, consider the direct sum and direct product of infinitely many real lines. An element in the direct product is an infinite sequence, such as (1,2,3,...) but in the direct sum, there would be a requirement that all but finitely many coordinates be zero, so the sequence (1,2,3,...) would be an element of the direct product but not of the direct sum, while (1,2,0,0,0,...) would be an element of both. More generally, if a + sign is used, all but finitely many coordinates must be zero, while if some form of multiplication is used, all but finitely many coordinates must be 1. In more technical language, if the summands are (A_i)_{i \\\\in I}, the direct sum \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} A_i is defined to be the set of tuples (a_i)_{i \\\\in I} with a_i \\\\in A_i such that a_i=0 for all but finitely many i. The direct sum \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} A_i is contained in the direct product \\\\prod_{i \\\\in I} A_i, but is usually strictly smaller when the index set I is infinite, because direct products do not have the restriction that all but finitely many coordinates must be zero.Thomas W. Hungerford, Algebra, p.60, Springer, 1974, Examples The xy-plane, a two-dimensional vector space, can be thought of as the direct sum of two one-dimensional vector spaces, namely the x and y axes. In this direct sum, the x and y axes intersect only at the origin (the zero vector). Addition is defined coordinate-wise, that is (x_1,y_1) + (x_2,y_2) = (x_1+x_2, y_1 + y_2), which is the same as vector addition. Given two structures A and B, their direct sum is written as A\\\\oplus B. Given an indexed family of structures A_i, indexed with i \\\\in I, the direct sum may be written \\\\textstyle A=\\\\bigoplus_{i\\\\in I}A_i. Each Ai is called a direct summand of A. If the index set is finite, the direct sum is the same as the direct product. In the case of groups, if the group operation is written as + the phrase \\"direct sum\\" is used, while if the group operation is written * the phrase \\"direct product\\" is used. When the index set is infinite, the direct sum is not the same as the direct product since the direct sum has the extra requirement that all but finitely many coordinates must be zero. =Internal and external direct sums= A distinction is made between internal and external direct sums, though the two are isomorphic. If the factors are defined first, and then the direct sum is defined in terms of the factors, we have an external direct sum. For example, if we define the real numbers \\\\mathbf{R} and then define \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{R} the direct sum is said to be external. If, on the other hand, we first define some algebraic structure S and then write S as a direct sum of two substructures V and W, then the direct sum is said to be internal. In this case, each element of S is expressible uniquely as an algebraic combination of an element of V and an element of W. For an example of an internal direct sum, consider \\\\mathbb Z_6 (the integers modulo six), whose elements are \\\\\\\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\\\\\\\}. This is expressible as an internal direct sum \\\\mathbb Z_6 = \\\\\\\\{0, 2, 4\\\\\\\\} \\\\oplus \\\\\\\\{0, 3\\\\\\\\}. Types of direct sum =Direct sum of abelian groups= The direct sum of abelian groups is a prototypical example of a direct sum. Given two abelian groups (A, \\\\circ) and (B, \\\\bullet), their direct sum A \\\\oplus B is the same as their direct product, that is the underlying set is the Cartesian product A \\\\times B and the group operation \\\\cdot is defined component-wise: :(a_1, b_1) \\\\cdot (a_2, b_2) = (a_1 \\\\circ a_2, b_1 \\\\bullet b_2). This definition generalizes to direct sums of finitely many abelian groups. For an infinite family of abelian groups Ai for i ∈ I, the direct sum :\\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I}A_i is a proper subgroup of the direct product. It consists of the elements \\\\textstyle (a_i)\\\\in\\\\prod_{j \\\\in I}A_j such that ai is the identity element of Ai for all but finitely many i.Joseph J. Rotman, The Theory of Groups: an Introduction, p. 177, Allyn and Bacon, 1965 =Direct sum of modules= The direct sum of modules is a construction which combines several modules into a new module. The most familiar examples of this construction occur when considering vector spaces, which are modules over a field. The construction may also be extended to Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces. =Direct sum of group representations= The direct sum of group representations generalizes the direct sum of the underlying modules, adding a group action to it. Specifically, given a group G and two representations V and W of G (or, more generally, two G-modules), the direct sum of the representations is V ⊕ W with the action of g ∈ G given component-wise, i.e. :g·(v, w) = (g·v, g·w). =Direct sum of rings= Some authors will speak of the direct sum R \\\\oplus S of two rings when they mean the direct product R \\\\times S, but this should be avoidedMath StackExchange on direct sum of rings vs. direct product of rings. since R \\\\times S does not receive natural ring homomorphisms from R and S: in particular, the map R \\\\to R \\\\times S sending r to (r,0) is not a ring homomorphism since it fails to send 1 to (1,1) (assuming that 0≠1 in S). Thus R \\\\times S is not a coproduct in the category of rings, and should not be written as a direct sum. (The coproduct in the category of commutative rings is the tensor product of rings., section I.11 In the category of rings, the coproduct is given by a construction similar to the free product of groups.) Use of direct sum terminology and notation is especially problematic when dealing with infinite families of rings: If (R_i)_{i \\\\in I} is an infinite collection of nontrivial rings, then the direct sum of the underlying additive groups can be equipped with termwise multiplication, but this produces a rng, i.e., a ring without a multiplicative identity. =Direct sum in categories= An additive category is an abstraction of the properties of the category of modules.\\"p.45\\" In such a category finite products and coproducts agree and the direct sum is either of them, cf. biproduct. General case:nlab In category theory the direct sum is often, but not always, the coproduct in the category of the mathematical objects in question. For example, in the category of abelian groups, direct sum is a coproduct. This is also true in the category of modules. Homomorphisms The direct sum \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} A_i comes equipped with a projection homomorphism \\\\pi_j \\\\colon \\\\, \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} A_i \\\\to A_j for each j in I and a coprojection \\\\alpha_j \\\\colon \\\\, A_j \\\\to \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} A_i for each j in I. Given another algebraic structure B (with the same additional structure) and homomorphisms g_j \\\\colon A_j \\\\to B for every j in I, there is a unique homomorphism g \\\\colon \\\\, \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} A_i \\\\to B, called the sum of the gj, such that g \\\\alpha_j =g_j for all j. Thus the direct sum is the coproduct in the appropriate category.

Like other Islamic finance products, Takaful is grounded in Islamic Muamalat (commercial and civil acts or dealings branch of Islamic law). In 2018, the takaful industry had grown to a size of $27.7 billion of \\"contributions\\" (from a 2011 figure of $12 billion). The movement has been praised as providing \\"superior alternatives\\" to insurance that \\"reinvigorate human capital, emphasize personal dignity, community self-help, and economic self-development\\"; but also criticized as having \\"dwindled\\" in scope to an industry of \\"conventional insurance with Arabic terminology and language of contract\\".Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.410 Principles Theoretically, takaful is perceived as cooperative or mutual insurance, where members contribute a certain sum of money to a common pool. The purpose of this system is not profits, but to uphold the principle of \\"bear ye one another's burden\\". The principles of takaful are as follows: * Policyholders cooperate among themselves for their common good. * Policyholders' contributions are considered as donations to the fund (pool). * Every policyholder pays his subscription to help those who need assistance. * Losses are divided and liabilities spread according to the community pooling system. * Uncertainty is eliminated concerning subscription and compensation. * It does not derive advantage at the cost of others. Muslims scholar have \\"hardly any difference of opinion\\" on \\"the need for managing, redeeming and mitigating general, business and life risks covered by the insurance business\\". But whether conventional insurance is forbidden (haram) is disputed. = Fiqh scholars = In its second session (December 1985), the Fiqh Academy of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (also called the International Islamic Fiqh Academy) ruled conventional commercial (but not social insurance) insurance haram (forbidden). Its ninth resolution stated: > The commercial insurance contract, with a fixed insurance premium, as > practiced by commercial insurance companies, contains substantial gharar, > which renders the contract defective. Consequently, it is legally > forbidden.El-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p.147 =Argument against conventional insurance= Islamic scholars began forbidding commercial insurance as early as the late nineteenth century C.E. Orthodox (i.e. most) Islamic scholars believe commercial insurance is disallowed for Muslims because it contains * Al-Gharar (uncertainty) * Al- Maisir (gambling) * Riba (usury) They have two main concerns about conventional insurance: #The uncertainty \\"if and when the insured event will take place and, if it does take place, what would be the relationship of compensation to the insurance premium paid\\". (What if the holder of collision insurance policy never has a motor vehicle accident? they lose and the insurance company wins. Regarding life insurance, everyone dies, but what if the death occurs after the first payment of a premium for life insurance? they win and the insurance company loses.) This \\"makes the insurance business similar to gambling, where the gambler does not know the fate of the game\\". Thus, uncertainty in the conventional insurance business \\"is excessive and borders on prohibited gharar\\". #\\"Insurance companies invest surplus funds on the basis of interest and pay out a part of such earnings to policyholders as bonuses.\\" According to the 'orthodox interpretation', this is riba. = Defense of conventional insurance = A minority of Islamic scholars argue that insurance is not like gambling because in gambling, no risk is covered and no damage is mitigated. The gamblers play a game of chance for entertainment and profit in which they can win or lose, based on a conscious decision.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p.295 Insurance provides coverage for events out of the insured policyholder's control. When the policyholder collects a payout, they are not a winner, but a loser who at least has some compensation. Furthermore, while insurance involves uncertainty, \\"statistical techniques and actuarial sciences have progressed to a stage where the insurance company can calculate its risks and benefits with great precision,\\" so that the uncertainty involved in insurance can scarcely be called excessive in normal circumstances. =Scriptural basis= Islamic scholars supporting takaful point to Qur'an and several sayings (hadith) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Some examples are: ;Qur'an Basis of Co- operation: Help one another in al-Birr and in al-Taqwa (both: virtue, righteousness and piety), but do not help one another in sin and transgression. (Sūrat al-Māʼidah, Verse 2) ;Hadith * God will always help his servant for as long as he helps others. (Narratives by Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal and Imam Abu Daud.) *Basis of Responsibility: The place of relationships and feelings of people with faith, between each other, is just like the body; when one of its parts is afflicted with pain, then the rest of the body will be affected. (Narratives by Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim) * One true Muslim (Mu’min) and another true Muslim are like a building, whereby every part in it strengthens the other part. (Narratives by Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim) * Basis of Mutual Protection: By my life (which is in God's power), nobody will enter Paradise if he does not protect his neighbour who is in distress. (Narrative of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal.) The fundamentals underlying takaful are very similar to co-operative and mutual principles, to the extent that the co- operative and mutual model is one that is accepted under Islamic law. Takaful industry and models =History= The concept of takaful has reportedly been practised in various forms since 622 AD. Muslim jurists acknowledge that the basis of shared responsibility (in the system of aquila as practised between the Muslims of Mecca and Medina) laid the foundation of mutual insurance. \\"In the case of insurance, as with commercial banks, orthodox opinion prevailed,\\" and with \\"a consensus among Muslim scholars\\" about the legitimacy of takaful and the illegitimacy of conventional insurance, the \\"movement for Islamizing the contemporary insurance business\\" started around the mid-1970s. In 1976, a fatwa was issued by the Higher Council of Saudi Arabia \\"in favor of an Islamic model\\" of insurance. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy, Jeddah of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation also approved takaful as a legitimate form of business in 1985. The Islamic Insurance Company of Sudan started as the first takaful company in 1979. By the mid 1990s, there were seven takaful companies in Sudan, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.408 The industry grew from $1.384 billion in 2004 to $5.318 billion in 2008.Ernst & Young, World Takaful Report 2010 By the end of 2011, total takaful contributions amounted to $12 billion (as compared to $4 trillion for conventional insurance). In 2005, there were 82 companies around the world engaged in takaful business (77 dedicated takaful companies, and five \\"offering takaful products\\" from \\"Islamic windows\\"). By 2006, there were 133.Ernst & Young, World Takaful Report 2008 As with the traditional forms of insurance, reinsurance of a takaful operation may be used, known as \\"retakaful\\". Also in 2006, AIG, a non-Muslim US-based company (with more than 88 million customers in 130 countries), established a takaful subsidiary called AIG Takaful Enaya, headquartered in Bahrain.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p.302 As of 2013 the leading takaful countries are \\"Malaysia and the Gulf states\\". It was reported in 2016 that out of total 308 takaful companies, 93 are takaful windows; however, these takaful windows own only 2.5% of the total takaful assets. =Models= There are several models (and several variations) of how takaful can be implemented: * Mudharabah model (profit-sharing): the managers (shareholders) are sharing profit and losses with the policyhoders; used initially in Far East. * Tabarru'-based: \\"donations\\" (Tabarru'), i.e. premiums, are accumulated into a fund to meet members' losses. Members are not allowed to take back any contributions or profits from investments.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.405 * A combination of Tabarru' and Mudharabah: Bahrain, UAE and Middle East countries. * Wakala model: agency fee, received up front from the contributors and transferred to shareholders fund. * Al Waqf-based model: Waqf is a distinct entity and a legal person. According to one critic, \\"except for names and terms, the essence\\" of both Al Waqf takaful and conventional insurance is the same, and as a consequence this structure \\"has come under a lot of criticism from Shari'ah scholars\\". Mainly used in Pakistan and South Africa. =The Mudharabah model (profit-sharing)= According to this principle the al-Mudharib (takaful operator) accepts payment of the takaful installments or takaful contributions (premiums, known as ra's-ul-mal) from investors or providers of capital or funds (takaful participants), acting as sahib-ul-mal. The contract specifies how the profits (or surplus) from the operations of the takaful is to be shared in accordance with the principle of al-mudharabah between the participants (as providers of capital) and the takaful operator. The sharing of such profit may be in a ratio of 50:50, 60:40, 70:30 and so forth, as mutually agreed between the contracting parties. In order to eliminate the element of uncertainty in the takaful contract, the concept of tabarru' (\\"to donate, contribute, or give away\\") is incorporated. Relating to this concept, a participant agrees to relinquish (as tabarru') a certain proportion of his takaful installments (or contributions) that he agrees or undertakes to pay, should any of his fellow participants suffer a defined loss. This agreement enables him to fulfill his obligation of mutual help and joint guarantee. In essence, tabarru' enables participants to perform their deeds in assisting fellow participants who might suffer a loss or damage due to a catastrophe or disaster. The sharing of profit (or surplus) that may emerge from the operations of a takaful is made only after the obligation of assisting the fellow participants has been fulfilled. It is imperative, therefore, for a takaful operator to maintain adequate assets of the defined funds under its care whilst striving prudently to ensure the funds are sufficiently protected against over-exposure. Therefore, the provision of insurance coverage is in conformity with Shariah based on the Islamic principles of al-takaful and al-mudharabah. Al-mudharabah is the commercial profit-sharing contract between the provider or providers of funds for a business venture and the entrepreneur who actually conducts the business. The operation of a takaful may thus be envisaged as the profit-sharing business venture between the takaful operator and the individual members of a group of participants who desire to reciprocally guarantee each other against a certain loss or damage that may be inflicted upon any one of them. Criticism One complaint made against (most) takaful (by Muhammad Akram Khan) is that despite the talk of solidarity, (most) takaful-holders \\"do not have any 'voice'\\" in the management of the takaful. The \\"TO (takaful operator) makes all the crucial decisions, such as rate of premium, risk strategy, asset management and allocation of surpluses and profits\\". The shareholders of the TO, and \\"not the takaful-holders, appoint and dismiss managers of the takaful\\".Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.409 Similarly, Mahmud El-Gamal complains that \\"even companies that use the term takaful ta'āwun (cooperative mutual guarantee or insurance) are structured with stockholder rather than policyholder ownership\\", despite the 9/2 ruling of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy that permitted insurance as \\"cooperative insurance, built on the principles of voluntary contribution (tabarru') and mutual cooperation\\".El- Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p.170 An exception to this state of affairs can be found in Sudan, where the takaful-holders have more say in the management of the takaful business. Whether takaful is significantly different from conventional insurance has been questioned. Islamic economist Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui writes that > \\"The form of organization chosen to take advantage of the law of large > numbers does not change the reality. We can make insurance a not-for-profit > activity (provided we can ensure efficient management), but it does not > change the essential nature of what is being done.\\"Siddiqui, Mohammad > Najatuallah \\"Islamic banking and finance in theory and practice: A survey of > the state of the art.\\" Islamic Economic Studies, 13 (2) (February): 1-48 According to Rakaan Kayali, the fact that benefits for the takaful members are distributed as funds allow, rather than defined by the policy, may lead to conflict among members — if, for example, one member's claim uses up takaful funds so that another member with an equally valid claim a short time later is not compensated, or not compensated in full. Additionally, there has been doubt cast on the legitimacy of claiming that takaful participants are making \\"donations\\". This is because the word \\"donations\\" implies giving with no expectation of worldly return. This is clearly not the case with takaful participants who are seeking insurance.

The grip you place on will help you have different types of shots, the lower your grip means that the ball is most likely going to be a ground stroke. According to William T. Tilden, \\"All tennis strokes, should be made with the body' at right angles to the net, with the shoulders lined up parallel to the line of flight of the ball .\\" The serve is the opening shot of a point. Groundstrokes are hit after the ball has already bounced, and can be either forehands or backhands depending on which direction the racket is swung relative to the body. A lob is a groundstroke hit well over the head of an opponent who is positioned at the net. A passing shot is a groundstroke that is hit out of reach of an opponent at the net far to his left or right. A cross-court shot is a shot hit from the left (or right) side of one player's court to the left (or right) side of the other player's court (from each player's own point of view), so that it crosses the lengthwise centerline of the court. A down-the-line shot is one that is hit more or less parallel to, and near to, one of the sidelines, so that it never crosses the centerline. Shots hit during a point without the ball having bounced are called volleys, while shots hit just a split second after the ball bounces are called half volleys. A smash is hit with the racket well above one's head with great velocity. A drop shot is a groundstroke or volley that is hit lightly so that it barely goes over the net. A slice is a groundstroke or volley hit with backspin, while a topspin shot is a groundstroke or occasionally a volley hit with topspin. Thus tennis shots can be categorized according to when they are hit (serve, groundstroke, volley, half volley), how they are hit (smash, forehand, backhand, flat, side spin, block, slice, topspin shot), or where they are hit (lob, passing shot, dropshot, cross-court shot, down-the-line shot). All shots that pass either over or around the net and land anywhere within the confines of the court, lines included (except for serves, which need to land inside the designated service box), are considered good. Serve A serve (or, more formally, a service) in tennis is a shot to begin the point. The most common serve is used is an overhead serve. It is initiated by tossing the ball into the air over the server's head and hitting it when the arm is fully stretched out (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The server may employ different types of serve: a flat, a top-spin, an American twist (or kick), or a slice serve. A severely sliced serve is sometimes called a sidespin. Some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an ace. Forehand The forehand is struck from the dominant side of the body by swinging the racquet in the direction of where the player wants to place the shot. It is called a forehand because the racquet is held in such a way that if one were to strike the ball without the racquet, it would hit the palm of your hand. This is the opposite side from a backhand. It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke. Beginners and advanced players often have better forehands than any other shots and use it as a weapon. There are various grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the Continental, the Eastern, and the Western. The key differences between grips are the different angles they create between the angle of your palm and the angle of your racquet face. You are used to sensing the direction your palm is facing, so your palm makes the most intuitive basis for sensing the direction your racquet is facing. For a number of years the small, apparently frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a western grip. Few top players used the western grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racquet, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand to devastating effect against larger, more powerful players, and many female and young players use the two-handed stroke today. Backhand The backhand is struck from the non-dominant side of the body by bringing the racquet across the body (showing the back of your hand to the opponent) and swinging the racquet away from one's body in the direction of where the player wants the ball to go. It is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. It can be executed with either one or both hands. For most of the 20th Century it was performed with one hand, using either an eastern or a continental grip. The first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich. The Two handed backhand was used more often since it allowed easy access to power and control. Players such as Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, and Andre Agassi have used this stroke to its highest potential to win many grandslams. Two hands give the player more power so it provides the player with an advantage on power- focused shots. However, one hand is useful in that it can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, Don Budge, had a very powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and '40s that imparted topspin onto the ball. Ken Rosewall, another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a deadly accurate slice backhand with underspin through the 1950s and '60s. A small number of players, notably Monica Seles, use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides. Volley A volley is made in the air before the ball bounces, generally near the net or inside of the service line. Volleys consist of the forehand volley and backhand volley and are usually made with a stiff-wristed \\"punching\\" motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent's court. The half volley is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, once again generally in the vicinity of the net. From a poor defensive position on the baseline, the lob can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber (the player hitting the lob) to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, the opponent may then hit an overhead smash, a hard, serve-like shot (hit over the players head), to end the point. Finally, if an opponent is deep in his court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected drop shot, softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it. Other shots The \\"tweener\\" is a rarely used shot in which a player hits the ball between his/her legs, generally with their back facing the net. Also known as the between-the-legs shot or the Gran Willy (after Guillermo Vilas, an early pioneer), it is generally performed when the player must run to recover a lob and has no time to turn back to face the net before attempting their return. The shot was pioneered in the 1970s by Guillermo Vilas and Yannick Noah, both of whom claimed to have invented it; later players to use it include Ilie Năstase, Boris Becker, Gabriela Sabatini (whose version was called the \\"Sabatwini\\"), Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Nicholas Kyrgios who helped popularize the shot. Forward-facing between-the-legs shots are also occasionally employed; they are sometimes called \\"front tweeners\\". The \\"Bucharest Backfire\\" is an over-the-shoulder backward shot, generally used to recover lobs. Tennis writer Bud Collins named it in honor of Romanian player Ilie Năstase, who popularized it. Another seldom used shot is a behind-the- back shot, which, as its name suggests, is hit by crossing the preferred arm across his/her back without swinging. It is generally hit while stationary, and can occasionally be used as a volley shot. It is challenging to master as it is hard to predict where the ball may strike the racket, if not at all in most cases. Accurately hitting the ball to the desired location is also extremely hard to do.

The phthorai nenano and nana were favoured by composers at the Monastery Agios Sabas, near Jerusalem, while hymnographers at the Stoudiou-Monastery obviously preferred the diatonic mele. The phthora nenano as part of the Hagiopolitan octoechos Today the system of eight diatonic modes and two ' (\\"destroyers\\") is regarded as the modal system of Byzantine chant, and during the eighth century it became also model for the Latin tonaries—introductions into a proper diatonic eight mode system and its psalmody, created by Frankish cantores during the Carolinigian reform.Peter Jeffery (2001) compared the Greek and the Latin octoechos and found, that a modal classification of Gregorian chant according to the octoechos was analytically deduced a posteriori. While φθορά νενανῶ was often called \\"chromatic\\", the second ' was named \\"nana\\" (gr. φθορά νανὰ) and called \\"enharmonic\\", the names were simply taken from the syllables used for the intonation (enechema). The two ' were regarded as two proper modes, but also used as transposition or alteration signs. Within the diatonic modes of the octoechos they cause a change into another (chromatic or enharmonic) genus (metavoli kata genos).See Barbera's entry \\"Metabolē\\". The earliest description of and of the eight mode system (octoechos) can be found in the Hagiopolites treatise which is known in a complete form through a fourteenth-century manuscript.Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, fonds grec, ms. 360. The treatise itself can be dated back to the ninth century, when it introduced the book of tropologion, a collection of troparic and heirmologic hymns which was ordered according to the eight-week cycle of the octoechos.Peter Jeffery (2001), Christian Hannick & Gerda Wolfram (1997). The first paragraph of the treatise maintains, that it was written by John of Damascus.John of Damascus and Cosmas entered the Lavra Agios Sabas about 700, after the reform was already established by a synodal decree in 692, and certain passages paraphrases polemics against the 16 echoi of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite (Raasted 1983, 16—§8, Jeffery 2001, 186f). The hymns of the ' provided the melodic models of one mode called echos (gr. ἦχος), and models for the ' appeared in some mele of certain ' like ' and '. > .Hagiopolites (Raasted 1983, 10—§2). > For the songs in this book eight Echoi are said to be necessary.

The word \\"mousike\\" () referred an autochthonous theory during the 8th century used by the generation of John of Damascus and Cosmas of Maiuma at Mar Saba, because it was independent from ancient Greek music.In the same way it was used by authors of Arabic treatises who referred to composers who avoided and others who liked the use of certain exotic tunes, while ancient Greek theorists did refer to older methods of composition. But it seems that it was regarded as inappropriate to use these for the hymn melodies composed by Joseph and other hymns composed since the ninth century, since they must have preferred the diatonic octoechos based on the and the instead of the . The concept of ' in the Hagiopolites was less concerned that the Nenano and Nana were somehow bridges between the modes. As an introduction of the tropologion it had to integrate the mele composed in these within the octoechos order and its weekly cycles. Since they had their own mele and compositions like the other echoi, they were subordinated to the eight diatonic according to the pitches or degrees of the mode (') of their cadences. > . > They were called Phthorai (i.e. destroyers), because they begin from their > own Echoi, but the thesis of their cadences and formulas are on notes > (phthongoi) from other Echoi.Quoted according Jørgen Raasted (1983, 42f—§34) > with a slightly modified translation. They had to be classified according to a certain echos of the eight-week cycle by adding the intonation \\"nenano\\" to the intonation of the main diatonic echos (usually abbreviated by a modal signature). For example, the intonation formula of (E) could be followed by the intonation of which leads to the (a), as a kind of \\"\\", which lies in between the finalis of the kyrios (b natural) and the one of its (E). Usually the diatonic (a) could end on its (D) in the diatonic genus, but the chromatic makes it end in the (E).  The use of phthora nenano in the psaltic art  In the period of the psaltic art (gr. ψαλτική τέχνη, \\"the art of chant\\", 1261-1750) the Late Byzantine Notation used four additional phthorai for each mode, including the eight diatonic ', in order to indicate the precise moment of a transposition (metavoli kata tonon).See Barbera's entry \\"Metabolē\\" (New Grove Dictionary). The former system of sixteen echoi (4 , 4 , 4 , and 4 ) which was still used in the old books of the cathedral rite (asmatikon, kontakarion, etc.), was replaced by the Hagiopolitan octoechos and its two . The new book ' which replaced the former book and established a mixed rite in Constantinople, introduced into eight diatonic echoi and two phthorai. In rather soloistic chant genres, the ' were turned into the chromatic genus by an abundant use of the '.Eustathios Makris (2005). Hence, it became necessary to distinguish between the proper echos and its phthora, nenano and nana as \\"extra modes\\", and their use for temporary changes within the melos of a certain diatonic echos. = The use of six phthorai for all of the ten Hagiopolitan echoi = In his theoretical treatise about psaltic art and in response to the \\"wrong ideas\\" that some singers already had some years after the conquest of Constantinople (1458), the famous Maïstoros Manuel Chrysaphes introduced not only into the two and nana, but also into four which bind the to the diatonic echoi of , and . GB- Lbl Ms. Harley 5544, f. 5v). All six , two of them belonged to the (the phthora of and the one of ), could dissolve the former melos and bind it to the of the following echos defined by the next medial signature. The diatonic was no longer the destruction of the diatonic modes and its genus, , and its tonal system, it could change each mode and its into another echos by a simple transposition. Hence, the list of mentioned in each Papadikai, was simply a catalogue of transposition signs, which were written over that where the transposition has to be done. = Phthora nenano and the plagal second echos = In that respect , as well as , stuck out, because within their own they were both directed to certain other . > Dimitri Conomos (1985, 64). > Whenever it stands in the melody [] of another echos, it creates its own > melody [] and cadence [] which the other phthorai cannot do, and its > resolution never closes into another mode apart from the .

It was the psaltic art itself which moved the ' of to the one of . It is possible, that the of was needed to change again into diatonic genus. According to the New Method (since 1814) was always chromatic and based on the of , memorised as . This was Chrysanthos' way to understand Manuel Chrysaphes—probably a contemporary way, since the 17th-century Papadike introduced a seventh for . 1832, 107, 109). According to the rules of psaltic art could connect the and as well as and , as can be seen from the solfège diagram called the \\"parallage of John Plousiadenos\\" (see the first X in the first row around the centre of the enechema of ). \\"\\" in an 18th-century manuscript (Athos, Docheiariou monastery, Ms. 319, fol. 18v) Despite this possibility Manuel Chrysaphes insisted, that and its chromatic has always to be resolved as , any other echos would be against the rules of psaltic art. The living tradition today still respects this rule, since of the () has become the same like (): (D). = The early Persian and Latin reception = Already in the thirteenth century, there were interval descriptions in Latin and Arabic treatises which proved that the use of the chromatic was common not only among Greek psaltes. Quţb al-Dīn al-Shīrīz distinguished two ways of using the chromatic genus in parde hiğāzī, named after a region of the Arabian Peninsula.Iannis Zannos (1994, 105f). The exact proportions were used during changes to the diatonic genus. In both diatonic and chromatic divisions the ring finger fret of the oud keyboard was used. It had the proportion 22:21—between middle and ring finger fret—and was called after the Baghdadi oud player Zalzal. These are the proportions, presented as a division of a tetrachord using the proportions of 22:21 and 7:6: 12:11 x 7:6 x 22:21 = 4:3 (approximate intervals in cents: 151, 267, 80 = 498) This Persian treatise is the earliest source which tried to measure the exact proportions of a chromatic mode, which can be compared with historical descriptions of phthora nenano. In his voluminous music treatise Jerome of Moravia described that \\"Gallian cantores\\" used to mix the diatonic genus with chromatic and the enharmonic, despite the use of the two latter were excluded according to Latin theorists:Oliver Gerlach (2010, 130) in his discussion of the earliest sources for the practice of pointed out, that Jerome who had an exceptional knowledge of Greek music theory, described the use of chromaticism among Parisian singers as a kind of . > Simon Cserba (1935, ii:187). > Especially when they mix the ecclesiastical chant with the organum mode, > they like not only to abandon the first mode [simple plainchant in > monophonic realization?], but the confusion of both [plainchant and ars > organi] includes another [confusion of the diatonic] with the other genera, > because they associate the enharmonic diesis and the chromatic trihemitonium > with the diatonic genus. They replace the semitonium by the tonus and vice > versa, in doing so they differ from the other nations, as far as chant is > concerned. During the seventies of the thirteenth century Jerome met the famous singers in Paris who were well skilled in the artistic performance of ars organi, which is evident by the chant manuscripts of the Abbey Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, of the Abbey Saint-Denis, and of the Notre Dame school. Despite the fact that no other Latin treatise ever mentioned that the singers were allowed to use enharmonic or chromatic intervals, and certainly not the transposition practice which was used sometimes by Greek psaltes, they obviously felt free enough to use both during the improvisation of organum—and probably, they became so familiar with the described enharmonic chromaticism, that they even used it during the monophonic performance of plainchant. Jerome as an educated listener regarded it as a \\"confusion\\" between monophonic and polyphonic performance style. Whatever his opinion about the performance style of Parisian cantores, the detailed description fit well to the use of the phthora nenano as an \\"echos kratema\\", as it was mentioned in the later Greek treatises after the end of the Byzantine Empire. = The phthora nenano as kyrios echos and echos kratema = According to a Papadike treatise in a sixteenth-century manuscript (Athens, National Library, Ms. 899 [EBE 899], fol.3f), the anonymous author even argues that and are rather independent modes than , because singers as well as composers can create whole kratemata out of them. > .Citation according Iannis Zannos (1994, 110f). > There are two phthorai which can be sung as those [of the Octoechos]: νανὰ > and νενανὼ. There are also the phthorai of the other [kyrioi] echoi, but > those are not as perfect [they have no proper melos like nana and nenano?], > because they just cause a temporary transition [] from one to another echos, > while the former have been used by composers of various epochs to create > kratemata like they were [independent] kyrioi echoi. Hence, it is justified > to call them rather \\"perfect echoi\\" than just \\"phthorai\\". Kratemata were longer sections sung with abstract syllables in a faster tempo. As a disgression used within other forms in papadic or kalophonic chant genres—soloistic like cherubim chant or a sticheron kalophonikon. From a composer's point of view who composed within the mele of the octoechos, a kratema could not only recapitulate the modal structure of its model, but also create a change into another (chromatic or enharmonic) genus. If a composer or protopsaltes realised a traditional model of a cherubikon or koinonikon within the of , the will always end the form of the kratema in echos , only then the singer could find a way back to the main echos. In the later case the kratema was composed so perfectly in the proper melos of , that it could be performed as a separate composition of its own, as they were already separated compositions in the simpler genres like the troparion and the heirmologic odes of the canon since the 9th century.Listen to Chourmouzios' transcription of John Koukouzeles' kratema. Gabriel Hieromonachus (mid fifteenth century) already mentioned that the \\"nenano phone\\"—the characteristic step (interval) of nenano—seemed to be in some way halved. On folio 5 verso of the quoted treatise (EBE 899), the author gave a similar description of the intervals used with the intonation formula νε–να–νὼ, and it fitted very well to the description that Jerome gave 300 years ago while he was listening to Parisian singers: > > Αὕτη ἡ φθορὰ εἰς τὰς ἀνιούσας. Ἰδοὺ γὰρ εἶπε τοῦ νω τὴν φωνὴν τὴν ἥμισυ > εἰς τὸ να}}.Citation according Zannos (1994, 112). The folio 5 verso of the > manuscript was reproduced by Eustathios Makris in his article (2005, > 4—fig.1), and so he proved that the little addition about the descending > intonation cannot be found as quoted by Ioannis Zannos (probably this was > the eighteenth-century redaction in Cod. Athos, Xeropotamou 317), so it is > written here in rectangular brackets. In fact the standard intonation given > in EBE 899 is just ascending. > Please note, what is called \\"phthora\\": phthora is called, if you make a half > phonic step in descending [direction], (or more precisely a third of it, > while [the second interval] has an ascending) one and a half, as in nenano. > Listen: [ison]— [dikentimata: small tone]— [oligon: one and a half of the great tone]— [oligon with diple: diesis or quarter tone] > This is the intonation of phthora which is ascending. Concerning the final > phonic step [which was a third of tonus in a descending melos], half of it > is now part of the [second] να step [] and the rest [interval is sung] on > νω! The upper small tone leading to the final note of the protos, has a slightly different intonation with respect to the melodic movement, at least according to the practice among educated psaltes of the Ottoman Empire during the eighteenth century. But Gabriel Hieromonachos described already in the fifteenth century, that the singers tend to stray away from their original intonation while they were singing the melos of phthora nenano: > .Christian Hannick & Gerda Wolfram (1985, 98—lines 680-86). > Because when we sing a nenano melody, we don’t end on the tone, from which > we started, but if you look at it closer, you will find that we come down to > a somewhat lower pitch. The reason for this is the nenano interval; for it > seems to be in some way halved, even if we are not aware of it; in other > words, we perform the nenano intervals weakly in upward direction, in order > to give the characteristic colour of nenano, but in downward direction [we > perform them] correctly, and this causes the melody to get out of > tune.English translation by Eustathios Makris (2005, 3f). Actual usage and meaning Later use of the enechema (initial incantation formula) of nenano as well as the phthora (alteration and transposition sign) of nenano in manuscripts makes it clear that it is associated with the main form of the second plagal mode as it survives in the current practice of Byzantine (Greek Orthodox) chant. Furthermore, the phthora sign of nenano has survived in the nineteenth-century neo-Byzantine notation system which is still used to switch between a diatonic and chromatic intonation of the tetrachord one fourth below. = Chrysanthos' exegesis of the phthora nenano = In the chapter \\"About apechemata\\", Chrysanthos quoted the medieval apechema of the as a chromatic tetrachord between the pitch () of and . The medieval This intonation formulas avoids the enharmonic step (diesis) which is expected between (δ') and (α'). His exegesis of this short apechema sets the chromatic or enharmonic tetrachord between (πλ α') and (δ'), so that the diesis lies between tritos (γ') and tetartos (δ'): Chrysanthos 1832, 142—§317) The common modern enechema places the tetrachord likewise: The current intonation of = Chrysanthos' exegeseis of the devteros echoi =  The hard chromatic plagios devteros  Chrysanthos 1832, 139) Chrysanthos of Madytos offered following exegesis of the traditional echema which was originally diatonic, but it is currently sung with the chromatic nenano intonation (see in Chrysanthos' parallage). Chrysanthos 1832, 139—§314) Chrysanthos 1832, 140—§314) Chrysanthos' exegesis employed the concluding cadence formula of the chromatic which was obviously an exegesis based on psaltic rules, as Manual Chrysaphes had once mentioned them. He described the correct intonation as follows: > §. 245. 3:12.Chrysanthos (1832, 106—§245). > The chromatic scale: D πα—[high E flat]—[high F sharp]—G δι—a κε—[high b > flat]—[high c sharp]—d πα', consists of two tetrachords. In each tetrachords > the hemitones are placed in a way, that the interval D πα—E βου [ὕφεσις] is > the same as a κε—b ζω' [ὕφεσις], Ε βου [ὕφεσις]—F sharp γα [δίεσις] is the > same as b ζω' [ὕφεσις]—c sharp νη' [δίεσις], and F sharp γα [δίεσις]—G δι is > the same as c sharp νη' [δίεσις]—d πα', so that both tetarchords, D πα—G δ > and a κε—d πα', are unisono. This means that the interval D πα—E βου > [ὕφεσις] is unisono with the small tone (ἐλάχιστος τόνος), Ε βου [ὕφεσις]—F > sharp γα [δίεσις] with the trihemitone, and F sharp γα [δίεσις]—G δι with > the hemitone: 3:12—a quarter of the great tone (μείζων τόνος) [7+18+3=28]. Despite of this tradition modern music teachers tried to translate this sophisticated intonation on a modern piano keyboard as \\"a kind of gipsy- minor.\\"According to this simplification a phthora of nenano is placed on δι, which in Western terms corresponds to the tone \\"G\\" (sol), then it indicates a chromatic tetrachord, approximated by the notes: D-high E flat-high F sharp-G. This is similar to the upper part of a G minor harmonic scale, or of the \\"Zigeunermoll\\" (gipsy-minor) scale. In other words, nenano is the prototype of the scale structure that includes an augmented second—which Hieronymus and Chrysanthos call more precise \\"trihemitone\\"—between two minor seconds and that is nowadays one of the most well known clichés commonly associated with near eastern or middle eastern \\"oriental\\" musical color.  The soft chromatic kyrios devteros  In a very similar way—like the classical intonation—also the soft chromatic intonation of the is represented as a kind of . Here according Chrysanthos of Madytos the exegesis of the traditional intonation can be sung like this: Chrysanthos 1832, 137-138—§310) He explained that the intonation of the modern was not based on tetraphonia, but on trichords or diphonia: > §. 244. > .Chrysanthos (1832, 105-106—§244). > The chromatic scale C νη—[D flat]—E βου—F γα—G δι—[a flat]—b ζω'—c νη' is > not made of tetrachords, but of trichords which are absolutely equal and > conjunct with each other—in this way: C νη—[D flat]—E βου, E βου—F γα—G δι, G δι—[a flat]—b ζω', b ζω'—c νη'—d πα' > If the scale starts on G δι, and it moves towards the lower, the step G δι—F > γα requests the interval of a great tone (μείζων τόνος) and the step F γα—E > βου a small tone (ἐλάχιστος τόνος); likewise the step E βου—[D flat] πα > [ὕφεσις] an interval of μείζων τόνος, and the step πα [ὕφεσις] [D flat]—C νη > one of ἐλάχιστος τόνος. When the direction is towards the higher, the step G > δι—[a flat] κε [ὕφεσις] requests the interval of a small tone and [a flat] > κε [ὕφεσις]—b ζω' that of a great tone; likewise the step b ζω'—c νη' an > interval of ἐλάχιστος τόνος, and the step c νη'—Cd πα one of μείζων τόνος. > Among the phthongoi of this chromatic scale only the phthongoi βου, γα, and > δι can be identified with the same phthongoi of the diatonic scale, while > the others are moveable degrees of the mode. While this scale extends > between E βου and C νη over one great and one small tone [12+7=19], the > diatonic scale extends from the middle (ἐλάσσων τόνος) to the great tone > (μείζων τόνος) [12+9=21], for the interval between G δι and b ζω' it is the > same. 1832, pp. 106-108) = Phthora nenano as an \\"Ottoman corruption\\" = Because of its early status as one of the two mysterious extra modes in the system, nenano has been subject of much attention in Byzantine and post-Byzantine music theory. Papadikai like the manuscript EBE 899 and other late Byzantine manuscripts associate nenano and nana with the chromatic and the enharmonic genus, one of the three genera of tuning during Classical antiquity that fell into early misuse because of its complexity. If the phthora nenano was already chromatic during the 9th century, including the use of one enharmonic diesis, is still a controversial issue, but medieval Arabic, Persian and Latin authors like Jerome of Moravia rather hint to the possibility that it was. Greek music theoreticians such as Simon Karas continue up to the end of the twentieth century to regard the intonation nenano as \\"exotic,\\" although they do not always agree, whether the intonation is hard or soft chromatic.Among Phanariotes Simon Karas (1981) has another explanation as Chrysanthos' trichordal concept of which tried to integrate psaltic tradition to base the phthora on the (). These different approaches make a historical explanation very difficult (Makris 2005). Anonymous authors like the one of the 16th- century Papadike (EBE 899) maintained, that one of the minor tones in the tetrachord of nenano should be either smaller or larger than a tempered semitone, approaching the smallest interval of a third or a quarter of a tone. The banishment of instrumental musical practice and its theory from the tradition of Byzantine chant has made it very difficult to substantiate any such claims experimentally, and traditional singers use different intonations depending on their school. The only possible conclusions can be drawn indirectly and tentatively through comparisons with the tradition of Ottoman instrumental court music, which important church theoreticians such as the Kyrillos Marmarinos, Archbishop of Tinos considered a necessary complement to liturgical chant.Eugenia Popescu-Județ and Adriana Şırlı (2000). However, Ottoman court music and its theory are also complex and diverging versions of modes exist according to different schools, ethnic traditions or theorists. There, one encounters various versions of the \\"nenano\\" tetrachord, both with a narrow and with a wider minor second either at the top or at the bottom, depending on the interval structure of the scale beyond the two ends of the tetrachord. Although the phthora nenano is already known as one of two additional phthorai used within the Hagiopolitan octoechos, its chromaticism was often misunderstood as a late corruption of Byzantine chant during the Ottoman Empire, but recent comparisons with medieval Arabic treatises proved that this exchange can dated back to a much earlier period, when Arab music was created as a synthesis of Persian music and Byzantine chant of Damascus.Eckhard Neubauer (1998).

He worked alongside Chris Moyles at BBC Radio 1, having originally been a broadcast assistant on Moyles' early morning show. He became the show's head writer and 'Director of Comedy' and moved with Moyles to the drivetime slot, and then to The Radio 1 Breakfast Show, during which time the programme was known as The Chris Moyles Show. In total, he spent 14 years from 1998 to 2012 working alongside Moyles. Dave has also presented other shows on Radio 1 and BBC Radio 5 Live, as well as some presenting work on television, including Channel 4's Coach Trip. He is a former contestant on Dancing on Ice. Background Comedy Dave was educated at Glenealy Junior School and Bedford School, the name 'Comedy Dave' came from when he ran the tuck shop in the school hall and would regularly tell jokes in order to make more sales, many included impersonations of the teachers accents. After school, Vitty studied Radio Production at college, but never had any ambitions to be on-air. He began working as a copywriterInterview with 'Comedy' Dave and then moved onto becoming a \\"tech op\\" for Radio 1 on 5 December 1996. In 1997, he then met Chris Moyles – they got on well with each other and Moyles invited Vitty to work with him on his early morning show. When Moyles transferred to drive time in 1998, Vitty went with him and became \\"Comedy Dave\\" after comedian Lee Hurst asked Vitty on the show who he was, he said \\"Super Dave\\" to which Hurst sarcastically responded \\"Comedy Dave more like\\" in reference to his formative years nickname. .\\"The Gospel According to Chris Moyles: The Story of a Man and His Mouth\\" On 22 April 2011, Vitty and his wife, Jayne Sharp announced they were to split. The Chris Moyles Show Vitty's regular daily contribution to The Chris Moyles Show was the \\"Tedious Link\\" (which launched September 2002 – a parody of Jo Whiley's now-defunct \\"Tenuous Link\\"), a collection of loosely connected information, where one fact lead into another by way of juxtaposition, which then eventually lead into the title of a song (or the musicians responsible for it), often a \\"classic\\" or memorable tune, which was usually played at precisely 9am, preceded by the Greenwich time pips. Once the song had been played he was questioned by listeners and the rest of the crew about the validity of the information given out during the \\"Tedious Link\\" (the theme tune from Treasure Hunt is usually played in the background). The theme music from the TV comedy show Bottom was used as the \\"bed\\" (underlying music) for the feature but for January 2009 Chris Moyles unveiled a new purpose-written jingle and music. Around 9:05am, Vitty sang \\"Let's get ready to ramble\\", signifying the start of the feature \\"Half-Time in the Show\\", holding onto the last syllable for a good ten to twenty seconds, in the style of Michael Buffer. This feature was dropped on the show's return for the new year in January 2009. It was announced on the show on 11 July 2012 that Chris Moyles would be leaving the Radio 1 Breakfast Show in September 2012. Moyles went on to play Herod in a UK tour of the Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar in September – October 2012. It was unclear what activities Comedy Dave would move on to, but on this show Moyles simply said \\"We're off..\\" implying that the whole team was leaving.

The Scottish version is a common variation of the word Moray, an anglicisation of the Medieval Gaelic word Muireb (or Moreb); the b here was pronounced as v, hence the Latinization to Moravia. These names denote the district on the south shore of the Moray Firth, in Scotland. Murray is a direct transliteration of how Scottish people pronounce the word Moray. The Murray spelling is not used for the geographical area, which is Moray, but it became the commonest form of the surname, especially among Scottish emigrants, to the extent that the surname Murray is now much more common than the original surname Moray. See also Clan Murray. In addition to the Scottish derivation, the Irish version may derive from Ó Muireadhaigh, Mac Muireadhaigh. and Mac Giolla Mhuire. History A considerable number of present bearers of this surname are of Scottish origin, especially in Ulster. Possible etymologies are: * From Moray in northeast Scotland, which came from the Scottish Gaelic for \\"sea settlement\\". * As a native Irish of this name, from Mac Muireadhaigh or Ó Muireadhaigh \\"descendant of Muireadhach\\" or Mac Giolla Mhuire \\"descendant of the servant of the Virgin Mary\\". The motto for Murray is Imperio. \\"Murrays\\" trace their heritage back to the 12th century and take their name from the province of Moray, once a local kingdom. It was during this time that the Flemish lords crossed the North Sea and established themselves in the Scottish realm. Among them was Freskin. It is possible that either Freskin or his son William intermarried with the ancient royal house of Moray. The senior line of the Murrays took the surname of Sutherland and became Earls of Sutherland by 1235. Thereafter, the chiefs of the Murrays were the Lords of Petty in Moray, who also became Lords of Bothwell in Clydesdale before 1253. An heir of this line, Sir Andrew Moray, was the brilliant young general who led the Scots in 1297 in their first uprising against English rule. He was mortally wounded while winning his famous victory at Stirling Bridge. His son, Sir Andrew Murray, 4th Lord of Bothwell, third Regent of Scotland, married Christian Bruce, a sister of King Robert the Bruce. He was captured at Roxburgh early in 1333 and was a prisoner in England at the time of the Battle of Halidon Hill. He obtained his freedom in time to march to the relief of his wife, who was defending Kildrummy Castle. Sir Andrew commenced with unabated spirit to struggle in the cause of independence and died in 1338. The last Murray Lord of Bothwell died in 1360 of the plague. By the 16th century, the Murrays of Tullibardine in Strathearn had assumed the leadership of the Murrays. This was formally confirmed by Bands of Association in 1586 and 1589. Sir John became the 1st Earl of Tullibardine in 1606. Thus, the Tullibardine hegemony was firmly established among the Murrays; and George Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl was also Marquis of Tullibardine as recognized in Lyon Register as Chief of the Murrays. The 2nd Earl of Tullibardine William Murray, 1574 circa – 1628, married Lady Dorothea Stewart, heiress of the Earls of Atholl in 1629 and Marquises from 1676. To their medieval peacock's head crest (motto-Praite), they added the mermaid (motto- Tout Pret), as Lords of Balquidder; and in the seventeenth century, they took the demi-savage holding a sword and a key commemorating the capture of the last Lord of the Isles by the 1st Stewart Earl of Atholl in 1475: hence the motto Furth, Fortune, and Fill the Fetters. (Go forth against your enemies, have good fortune, and return with hostages and booty). Since 1703, the Murray's chiefs have been Dukes of Atholl. For a time in the 18th century, the Murray dukes were also Sovereign Lords of the Isle of Man, with their own coinage and parliament, The House of Keys. The 1st Duke's younger son, Lord George Murray, was the Jacobite general responsible for the highlander's successes through the early part of the 1745 uprising. Much of the above information about the Murrays was taken from the book The Highland Clans, by Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk. Lord George's descendant George Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl, died in February 1996. The new Duke of Atholl is John Murray, 11th Duke of Atholl, a South African. The new Duke has taken the chiefship of the Murrays.

She is also the co-creator of Tots TV and Rosie and Jim. She was a recipient of the Eleanor Farjeon Award. Early years She was born in Spennymoor, County Durham, England, and grew up in Tudhoe Colliery, a small coal-mining village nearby. Career She qualified as a secondary school teacher through the Bingley Training College in Yorkshire and took up her first teaching post back home in Spennymoor. She married Barrie Wood in 1959 and moved to Surbiton in Surrey where she took up a teaching role at Hollyfield Road Secondary School. This was the era of the first children's paperback book and Anne became an early pioneer of a children's paperback book club scheme for schools set up by Scholastic Publications. She retired from teaching on the birth of her daughter and was taken on by Scholastic as editor of their Children's Book Club. =Children’s books= When the Wood family moved to Byfleet in Surrey, she expanded her interest in how books and children's development could be brought together. In 1965 she founded and edited a quarterly magazine Books for Your Children, a publication aimed at parents, teachers and librarians and fully supported by children's publishers. Initially the UK Arts Council supported the magazine with a small financial grant. As a further promotion of children's books in 1969 Wood set up the Federation of Children's Book Groups, an organisation still in existence today. Also in 1969 in recognition of her contribution to the promotion of children's books Wood was awarded the Eleanor Farjeon Award. =Television producer= #Tyne Tees Television for ITV 1977 Puzzle Party hosted by Gyles Brandreth and featuring Gnigel the Gnu #Yorkshire Television for ITV 1979 – 1983 5 series of The Book Tower, a programme aimed at stimulating children's interest in books.

","title":"Anne Wood"},{"id":"2084796","text":"The Royal Artillery Museum, one of the world's oldest military museums, was first opened to the public in Woolwich in south-east London in 1820. It told the story of the development of artillery through the ages by way of an unrivalled collection of artillery pieces from across the centuries. The museum had its roots in an earlier institution, the Royal Military Repository (established in Woolwich in the 1770s as a training collection for cadets of the Royal Military Academy); items which were once displayed in the Repository form the nucleus of the Royal Artillery Museum collection. Following the closure in 2016 of the museum, branded since 2001 as 'Firepower – The Royal Artillery Museum', its collection has been placed in storage pending the establishment of a new Royal Artillery Museum. The Royal Artillery Museum collections are designated as being of national and international significance by Arts Council England. History The regiment initially consisted of two permanent companies of field artillery which were established in 1716, each 100 men strong; this became the \\"Royal Artillery\\" in 1720.History and Traditions of the Royal Artillery Originally based in the Royal Arsenal, beginning in 1770 the regiment was rehoused in the Royal Artillery Barracks on Woolwich Common. =The Royal Military Repository= The former Royal Military Academy building housed the collection from 1802 to 1820 In 1778 Captain William Congreve set up a training establishment within the Warren, as an offshoot of the Royal Military Academy, to instruct officers in handling heavy equipment in the field of battle. His 'Repository of Military Machines' (soon given the title of Royal Military Repository ) was housed in a long two-storey building alongside the Carriage Works: cannons used for field training were stored on the ground floor while smaller items and models used for teaching purposes were displayed upstairs. Training initially took place on land to the east of the Warren and later moved to the woods to the west of Woolwich Common, close to the new Artillery Barracks, which are known still as 'Repository Grounds'. The Repository building itself was seriously damaged by fire (probably arson) in 1802. Those items that were saved or salvaged soon found a new home in the old premises of the Royal Military Academy, which itself moved from the Arsenal to Woolwich Common in 1806. =The Museum in the Rotunda= John Nash's Hyde Park Rotunda was rebuilt on Woolwich Common in 1820 to house the Royal Artillery Museum collections until 1999 The Repository collection found a new home in a building of unusual provenance, secured for this purpose by the son of the Repository's founder (also named William Congreve). The Rotunda was initially erected in London in 1814 as an elaborate temporary marquee in the grounds of Carlton House. It was built for a ball given by the Prince Regent in honour of the Duke of Wellington in anticipation of victory over Napoleon Bonaparte; designed by John Nash, it was made to resemble a military bell tent. After the victory celebrations were over the building languished without a use; but in 1818 the Prince Regent authorised the Rotunda's removal to Woolwich \\"to be appropriated to the conservation of the trophies obtained in the last war, the artillery models, and other military curiosities usually preserved in the Repository\\" and it was rebuilt on the eastern edge of the Repository Grounds. In its new accessible location the Repository became 'an early and free permanent public museum'. Inside, trophies and weapons were arranged around the central column with display cases all around containing models and smaller exhibits; larger artillery pieces were displayed outside. The museum continued in the Rotunda through to the very end of the 20th century, despite attempts at various times (including in 1932, 1953, in the 1960s and 1980s) to move it elsewhere. Eventually accommodation was secured for a new museum within what had been the Royal Arsenal, after the Army left the site in the 1990s. The Royal Artillery Museum in the Rotunda closed in 1999 (though the Rotunda continued to house the museum's reserve collection until 2010). =Firepower= Part of the museum collection as presented in Firepower's Gunnery Hall, with 20th-century pieces on the ground floor and older items above Between 2001 and 2016 the museum was branded as Firepower: The Royal Artillery Museum and housed in some of the former buildings of the Royal Arsenal. All Firepower's buildings were once part of the Royal Laboratory Department, which controlled the manufacture of ammunition; they are for the most part Grade II listed. The adjacent Greenwich Heritage Centre told the story of the local people of Greenwich who worked in the Arsenal and made the guns. Closure Firepower closed in July 2016 and its buildings were acquired by Greenwich Council, which has hopes of establishing a \\"significant new cultural and heritage quarter\\" on the site. The relocation of the museum was described by a board member as a \\"missed opportunity\\". Greenwich Heritage Centre tried to fill the gap by creating a new permanent exhibition Making Woolwich: The Royal Regiment of Artillery in Woolwich. The project was supported amongst others by the Royal Regiment of Artillery, Royal Artillery Museums Ltd, Friends of the Royal Artillery Collections and the Royal Artillery Historical Trust.‘Making Woolwich’ – A New Permanent Exhibition, 2016. greenwichheritage.org. Accessed: 22 February 2017 Future of the buildings In 2017 it was announced that the Royal Borough of Greenwich has acquired five historic buildings around No 1 Street to create a £31 million cultural district. This includes buildings 17, 18 and 41, which were all used by Firepower. The plan includes a 450-seat black box theatre that will be built on the site of the former museum entrance. Building 17 (and other listed buildings nearby) will house rehearsal studios for resident companies such as Academy Performing Arts, Dash Arts, Chickenshed Theatre, Protein Dance, Greenwich Dance and Greenwich+Docklands International Festival. The Greenwich Heritage Centre was intended to move to the former James Clavell Library, until 2016 part of Firepower, but closed in July 2018.

However, in 2020 the Chief of the General Staff withdrew his support for the lease of proposed site, leading to a \\"strategic re-appraisal\\" of the project. In the meantime, the exhibits are being professionally stored and conserved in a museum stores nearby, but there is limited public access.

Although operating only at a junior level, he was able to provide details of naval technology which were crucial to the modernising of the Soviet Navy. He was sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment, and was released in 1972 after ten. The Vassall scandal greatly embarrassed the Macmillan government, but was soon eclipsed by the more dramatic Profumo affair. Early life Born in 1924 and known throughout his life as John Vassall, he was the son of William Vassall, chaplain at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and Mabel Andrea Sellicks, a nurse at the same hospital.Martland 2004. He was educated at Monmouth School. During the Second World War he worked as a photographer for the Royal Air Force. After the war, in 1948, he became a clerk (clerical officer) at the Admiralty. Although his father was an Anglican priest, his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, a decision that led to tensions within their marriage. Vassall himself converted to Catholicism in 1953.Vassall 1975, pp. 12–13, 26–7. Spying career In 1952, Vassall was appointed, still as a clerical officer, to the staff of the Naval Attaché at the British embassy in Moscow. There, he said later, he found himself socially isolated by the snobberies and class hierarchies of diplomatic life, his loneliness further exacerbated by his homosexuality, which was still illegal in both Britain and the Soviet Union at the time. He became acquainted with a Pole named Mikhailsky, who worked for the Embassy, and who introduced him to the homosexual underworld of Moscow. In 1954, he was invited to a party, where he was encouraged to become extremely drunk, and where he was photographed in compromising positions with several men.Vassall 1975, pp. 53–56.Tweedie 2006. The party, arranged by the KGB, had been a classic \\"honeytrap\\". The Soviets used the photographs to blackmail Vassall into working for them as a spy, initially in the Moscow embassy, and later in London, following his return there in June 1956. He returned to the Admiralty, where he worked first in the Naval Intelligence Division, and then, as the clerical officer assistant to the Private Secretary, in the Private Office of Tam Galbraith, a Conservative Party politician and Civil Lord of the Admiralty. At the time of his arrest he was working in Military Branch II. During his espionage career, Vassall provided the Soviets with several thousand classified documents, including information on British radar, torpedoes, and anti-submarine equipment. His obituary-writer in The Times commented that \\"Vassall was never more than a low-level functionary, but there was nothing low-level about the damage he was able to inflict\\". Similarly, Chapman Pincher regarded Vassall as \\"the classic example of the spy who, while of lowly rank, can inflict enormous damage because of the excellence of his access to secret information\\". Pincher continued: \\"I am in no doubt that the recruitment and running of Vassall was a major triumph for the K.G.B. He provided information of the highest value to the Soviet defence chiefs in their successful drive to expand and modernise the Red Navy.\\"Pincher 1984, pp. 283–4. Rebecca West, in her book The New Meaning of Treason (1964) demurred from the notion that Vassall was \\"a weak and silly little man … This was unlikely to be the correct view of a man who for seven years had carried on an occupation [espionage] demanding unremitting industry in a skilled craft carried on in clandestine conditions, an endless capacity for dissimulation, and sustained contempt for personal danger.\\" West termed him, rather, \\"a professional spy, working within the conventions of his profession, [who] had no more been blackmailed into the exercise of his profession than any lawyer\\". West suggested that the claim of blackmail was \\"putting up a smoke-screen to conceal what he had done.\\" Observing that Vassall had been well paid by the Soviets for his spying, West wrote: \\"The drunken party may have taken place, but it was probably engineered so that Vassall might refer to it should his treachery ever be discovered … Only a very stupid and helpless man would have succumbed [to a blackmail threat], and Vassall was not stupid; he was extremely resourceful.\\"West 1981. Exposure Vassall was identified as a potential spy after Anatoliy Golitsyn, a senior member of the KGB, defected to the United States in 1961. The KGB, worried that Vassall would be exposed, ordered him to cease operations until further notice. Another defector, Yuri Nosenko, added to the case against Vassall, but doubts about the evidence provided by both Golitsyn and Nosenko persisted. Vassall soon resumed his work. It had become obvious to his colleagues that Vassall had some other source of income, for he moved to an expensive flat in Dolphin Square, took foreign holidays, and was said to own 36 Savile Row suits. His annual expenditure was later estimated at about £3,000, when his official salary was £750;Norton-Taylor 1996. but he explained that he had an inheritance from a distant relative. On 12 September 1962, Vassall was arrested and charged with spying. He made a full confession, and directed detectives to the cameras and films concealed in his flat.Vassall 1975, pp. 139–43. The documents that he admitted to stealing did not account for everything believed to have been taken, however, which led to speculation that there was another spy still operating in the Admiralty. Some have suggested that Vassall was deliberately sacrificed by the KGB in an attempt to protect the other (possibly more senior) spy. In October, Vassall was sentenced to 18 years in jail. The scandal caused the Macmillan government considerable embarrassment, erupting as it did at the height of the Cold War, only a year before the still-more dramatic revelations of the Profumo affair. The Vassall Tribunal was held to inquire into whether the failure to detect Vassall earlier amounted to a failure of intelligence, as many British newspapers had claimed. It also investigated suggestions that the close relations between Vassall and Galbraith had been improper. However, in its conclusions it found no evidence for impropriety, and largely exonerated the government. Later years Vassall served ten years of his sentence, in Wormwood Scrubs, Maidstone and Durham prisons.Vassall 1975, pp. 147–72. Many considered him to have been a relatively innocent victim of circumstances, and he was befriended in prison by social reformer Lord Longford. He was eventually released on parole in October 1972. He then wrote a memoir, published in 1975 as Vassall: the autobiography of a spy. He described it as \\"a kind of self-justification, not as regards my espionage activities, but as regards my position as a human being, and, perhaps, my ability to make and keep friends in all walks of life\\".Vassall 1975, p. 191. Rex Winsbury called the book \\"[a] cross between Jennifer's Diary [the society column of Queen magazine] and James Bond, ... bewildering both for Vassall's own transparent naivety and social snobbism, ... and for the equally transparent naivety of the British Foreign Office and security forces\\". Hungarian émigré George Mikes similarly concluded that it was Vassall's \\"vanity, his childish snobbery, his devouring ambition and complete lack of humour that pushed him so deep into the quagmire\\". Vassall subsequently changed his surname to Phillips, settled in St John's Wood, London, and worked quietly as an administrator at the British Records Association, and for a firm of solicitors in Gray's Inn.Telegraph Obituary, 1996. He died after suffering a heart attack on a London bus in November 1996: it was not until nearly three weeks later that the press became aware of his death. Media portrayals The suggestion of an improper relationship between Vassall and Tam Galbraith inspired a memorable sketch on the satirical BBC programme That Was the Week That Was, which was broadcast in 1963, in which Lance Percival played a senior civil servant detecting sexual innuendo in such conventional pleasantries as the salutation \\"My Dear Vassall\\" at the beginning of a letter. In 1980 the BBC broadcast a docudrama about the affair, in which Vassall was played by John Normington as \\"weak, vain and keen to be thought a gentleman\\". The play caused some controversy when it became known that neither Lady Hayter, the Ambassador's wife when Vassall arrived in Moscow, nor Captain Geoffrey Bennett, the naval attaché, had been consulted or advised that they were to be portrayed: they learned of it only when Radio Times was published four days before the broadcast.

Rivas was the third player from Puerto Rico to play in the NBA (after Butch Lee and José Ortiz), and half of the first duo of Puerto Ricans to be active in the NBA simultaneously (with Ortiz). Rivas has played in the NBA, NCAA Division I, and in the Puerto Rican National Superior League (BSN), with the Carolina Giants. Rivas also played internationally, in Spain, Greece, and Italy. Rivas was also a member of the senior Puerto Rican National Basketball Team for several years. He represented Puerto Rico at the following tournaments: the 1986 FIBA World Championship, in Málaga, Spain; the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, in Seoul, South Korea; the 1990 FIBA World Championship, in Buenos Aires, Argentina; the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, in Barcelona, Spain; and the 1996 Summer Olympics, in Atlanta, United States. Biography =Early years= As a youngster, Rivas played at The San Juan Y.M.C.A, for Millin Romero. He progressed through Carolina's minor basketball tournaments, becoming one of the best centers in Puerto Rico, while he played for Levittown's Pedro Albizu Campos High School's team. Flor Melendez took note of his progress, and signed him to play for the Carolina Giants, of Puerto Rico's top-tier level league, the BSN. That year he was selected BSN Rookie of the Year. The changes on the Carolina Giants were evident, when Rivas joined the team: From being one of the worst teams in the league, during the 1983 tournament, they got better every year. In 1987, the team almost reached the BSN playoffs, and, in 1988, the team finally reached the BSN playoffs, for the first time, having the best record in the regular season (1989 Regular Season: PPG.24.4, Reb.17.4 in 30 games). College career Rivas attended Temple University, where he played NCAA Division I college basketball with the Temple Owls, from 1984 to 1988, going on four occasions to the NCAA post season tournament. He was coached by Hall of Fame head coach John Chaney. Temple was ranked 1st in the nation in his senior year, with a record of 34 wins and 2 losses. Playing with the Owls helped him gain experience, and improve his game in the NCAA. He became well-known in the United States, as a center who could score points, and rebound in double figures, and was a respected player among his peers. Professional career =Signed by the NBA= Thanks to his notable NCAA Division I college basketball career, the Boston Celtics announced that they would sign Rivas for a full season, towards the end of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, in Seoul. Having coincided with José Ortiz's signing by the Utah Jazz two weeks prior, Rivas' signing by the Celtics was a cause of great celebration for Puerto Ricans, many of whom felt their efforts in basketball were finally being recognized by the NBA. With the Celtics, Rivas had the opportunity to share playing time alongside Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Dennis Johnson, Robert Parish, Reggie Lewis, and Brian Shaw, among others. The Celtics reached the playoffs, by beating the Washington Bullets by two games, for the eighth and final playoff spot in the NBA east that year, but were swept in three games, by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons, in the playoffs' first round. Because of his height, Rivas had to change playing positions when he arrived to the Celtics, going from playing center in Puerto Rico, to power forward in Boston. After that season with the Celtics, he came back to Puerto Rico, and received his first Puerto Rican League MVP honor, while playing for the Carolina Giants. That summer, he was signed by a basketball club in Spain, called Taugrés, which became his home for the next 7 years. =Europe= Rivas played for Taugrés in the Spanish League from 1989 until 1996, winning the Spanish King's Cup in 1995. He arrived with the Vitorian team to the FIBA European Cup (later called FIBA Saporta Cup) Finals in three consecutive years (1994, 1995, 1996) finally winning it in the 1995–96 season, against Peja Stojaković's team PAOK, and becoming the Finals MVP, with 32 points and 15 rebounds. In the 1996–97 season, he won the Spanish league with FC Barcelona and also finished runner-up of the 1996–97 FIBA EuroLeague, losing to Olympiacos from Greek Basket League. The following season went to Athens to play for AEK of Giannis Ioannidis, one of the biggest clubs in Greece, and played in another EuroLeague Final (1997–98 FIBA EuroLeague) against Ettore Messina's Kinder Bologna. In 1998, he went back to Spain, for his final year with the club Cáceres. In 1999, he played in Italy for the club Fabriano. National team career Rivas represented Puerto Rico, as a member of the senior Puerto Rican national basketball team, at the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, in Seoul, South Korea, the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, held at Barcelona, Spain, and the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, held in Atlanta. He also won the gold medal at the 1991 Pan American Games, and he also played at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, and the 1990 FIBA World Championship. Sports commentator Rivas worked for the Orlando Magic for 9 years, as a sports broadcasting color analyst, and for 5 years, for Fox Sports in Spanish. He worked as a TV sports color analyst at the Summer Olympic Games of Beijing 2008, and the Summer Olympic Games of London 2012, next to Edgar Lopez, for NBC Telemundo.

The Barons consisted of a Chief Baron of the Exchequer and several puisne (inferior) barons. When Robert Shute was appointed second baron in June 1579 the patent declared \\"he shall be reputed and be of the same order, rank, estimation, dignity and pre-eminence to all intents and purposes as any puisne judge of either of the two other courts.\\"Dugdale, Chronica, series 94; Foss, Judges of England, vol.II, 410. The rise of commercial trade in Elizabethan England occasioned fraudulent application of the Quo minus writ. More taxation demanded staff at the exchequer to sift an increase in the case load causing more widespread litigation cases to come to the court. From 1580s onwards the Barons of Exchequer were no longer held in such low regard, and more likely to be Serjeants-at-law before qualification. The Inns of Courts began to exclude solicitors, and held posts for judges and barons open equally to barristers. In 1591, Regulations reflected a case in which the Lord Keeper Egerton banned solicitors from seeking cases in the Exchequer. Together they sat as a court of common law, heard suits in the court of equity, and settled revenue disputes. A puisne baron was styled \\"Mr Baron X\\" and the chief baron as \\"Lord Chief Baron X\\". They were originally the same judges as those of the Court of King's Bench, only becoming independent positions after the Exchequer's separation from the curia regis.Thomas (1848) p.3 In the early years of the Exchequer's existence, the Barons were the chief auditors of the accounts of England, a role passed to dedicated auditors during the reign of Edward II.Thomas (1848) p.9 With the Exchequer's expansion during the Tudor era, the Barons became more important; where previously only the Chief Baron had been appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, with the other Barons mere barristers, it became practice for all Barons of the Exchequer to be Serjeants. This further increased the Exchequer's standing, since for the first time it put the Exchequer at the same level as the Court of Common Pleas and Court of King's Bench, where all judges were already required to be Serjeants.Guth (2008) p.151 Prior to the changes of 1533, Serjeants held precedence over barons \\"sitting in the high court,...of great eminence\\". Thereafter they held the degree of coif to qualify at the Inns of Court as the senior court at Westminster.Sir Edward Coke, Preface to Coke's 10th Law Report. From 1550 to 1579, there was a major distinction between the chief baron and the second, third and fourth puisne barons. The difference was in social status and education. All of the chief barons had been trained as lawyers in the inns of court. With the exception of Henry Bradshaw and Sir Clement Higham, both barristers-at-law, all of the chief barons who served Queen Elizabeth I, had attained the highest and most prestigious rank of a lawyer, serjeant-at-law. By 1841, the equitable jurisdiction was transferred to the Court of Chancery, which deals with pecuniary cases. History By 1272, individuals were nominated to the office of Baron of the Exchequer from time to time: 24 baronial justiciers were appointed by the end of Henry III's reign. From 1278, there were three Barons, with a fourth being appointed in 1296 and a fifth in 1299. By 1308, one of the Barons was recognised as Capitalem Baronem (Chief Baron). Edward I commanded the Exchequer sessions to be held at Hilary term.Rotuli Parliamentorum, ii, 442. By the reforms of the reign of King Richard II, barons were not necessarily qualified special pleaders or serjeants; office was in the gift of the king, and barons were not usually permitted to refuse appointment. From then until 1478, it was recognised that there should be four puisne Barons. One was frequently named as Second Baron and rarely appointments were named as Third Baron and Fourth Baron. From then until 1547, the three puisne barons were always appointed to numbered offices, but in 1549, Edward Saxleby as successor to John Darnall was merely appointed as 'one of the Barons of the Exchequer'. However, he and his successors held the office of Cursitor Baron. An additional Baron was appointed in 1604. The number of puisnes generally remained at three until the 19th century, but there was a fourth from 1708 to 1725 due to John Smith having leave of absence to attend to the office of a Baron of the Scottish Exchequer. A fourth puisne baron was appointed in 1830 and a fifth in 1868.Sir John Sainty (comp.)

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It is found in the Palearctic realm. It is a common species throughout Europe and North Asia and Central Asia, South Asia, China, Japan and Korea. It is also found in North America, from coast to coast across Canada and the northern United States to western Alaska. It occurs in the Rocky Mountains from Montana to southern Arizona and New Mexico. In the east, it ranges from Maine to North Carolina. It has recently been recorded in Tennessee. The forewings of this species are reddish brown with distinctive patterning towards the base; a black mark resembling the Hebrew letter nun (נ) with a pale cream-coloured area adjacent to this mark. The hindwings are cream coloured. Description The wingspan is 35–45 mm. Forewing purplish grey or purplish fuscous with a leaden gloss; costal area at middle ochreous, merged with the bluntly triangular orbicular stigma: cell, a submedian basal blotch, and costal spot before apex purplish black; claviform stigma minute; reniform large, the lower lobe purplish; hindwing ochreous whitish, in female with the termen broadly fuscous.Seitz, A.

A scarf joint (also known as a scarph joint) is a method of joining two members end to end in woodworking or metalworking.. The scarf joint is used when the material being joined is not available in the length required. It is an alternative to other joints such as the butt joint and the splice joint and is often favored over these in joinery because it yields a barely visible glue line. The scarf joint in wood In woodworking, there are two distinctly different categories of scarf, based on whether the joint has interlocking faces or not. A plain scarf is simply two flat planes meeting on an angle relative to the axis of the stock being joined, and depends entirely on adhesive and/or mechanical fasteners (such as screws, nails, or bolts) for all strength. Interlocking scarf joints, such as a hooked, keyed, and nibbed scarves, offer varying degrees of tensile and compressive strength, though most still depend on mechanical fastening to keep the joint closed. The plain scarf is not preferred when strength is required, so it is often used in decorative situations, such as the application of trim or moulding. The use of modern high-strength adhesives can greatly increase the structural performance of a plain scarf. The keyed-hook scarf is common in ship and boat-building, as well as timber framing and wooden bridge construction. In large timbers such as these the scarf is virtually always secured with through bolts, and is frequently reinforced externally with iron or steel fishplates, and/or strapping. A scarf joint may also be used to fix problems caused when a board is cut too short for the application. The board can be cut in half with a tapered cut yielding a scarf joint. When the joint is glued together, the tapers are slid against each other so that the two sections are no longer in line with each other. This has the effect of making the board longer. Once the glue has set, the board can be planed down to an even thickness, resulting in a longer but thinner board. In traditional timber framing there are many types of scarf joints used to join timbers. Methods The joint is formed by cutting opposing tapered ends on each member which are then fitted together. When working with wood, this gives better long grain to long grain gluing surface, which yields a stronger joint than would be achieved with a simple butt joint. The tapers are generally cut at an angle between 1:8 to 1:10. The ends of a plain scarf are feathered to a fine point which aids in the obscuring of the joint in the finished work, while in other forms of scarf the ends are frequently cut to a blunt \\"nib\\" which engages a matching shoulder in the mating piece. Where scarfed joints are used in the restoration of vintage aircraft most developed countries will only issue an airworthiness certificate if all such joints have used an angle no less than 1:8. Strength Determination of the maximum axial force for two pieces joined by adhesive can easily be determined using two equations that can be derived from the geometry of the problem by breaking the axial force component into a tensile force and shear force normal and parallel to the scarf joint. Shear strength is assumed to be equal to σ/2. The following equations need to be adjusted if the shear strength is greater than σ/2. The two equations that give a maximum axial force are F=σ/sin(α)^2 and F=σ/sin(2α), where α is the angle from the horizontal to the joint. Both should be evaluated for a given problem, and the smaller F of the two is the magnitude of the maximum allowable axial force. The first equation accounts for failure in tension. The second equation accounts for failure in shear. Some special angles should be noted or the graphs of two equations should be compared on the same plot. The joint is weakest at α=90° due to tension limits and 45° due to shear limits. However, α=45° will be stronger than α=90° if shear strength is greater than σ/2. The joint is strongest between these two angles at 63.4°. The joint becomes stronger than 63.4° at 25.4°. At a shallow enough angle, strength of the joint continues to increase and failure will occur anywhere in the two pieces, possibly outside the joint. References =Bibliography= *.

It was originally published in four volumes on 25 July 1818, under the title of Tales of My Landlord, 2nd series, and the author was given as \\"Jedediah Cleishbotham, Schoolmaster and Parish-clerk of Gandercleugh\\". The main action, which takes place between September 1736 and May 1737, is set in motion by the Porteous Riots in Edinburgh and involves an epic journey from Edinburgh to London by a working-class girl to obtain a royal commutation of the death penalty incurred by her sister for the alleged murder of her new-born baby. Composition and sources Scott signed the contract for a second series of Tales of my Landlord with Archibald Constable on 25 November 1817. He had the conception of The Heart of Mid-Lothian in his head by that date, and indeed it is possible that he had already produced the introductory chapter as early as April that year, but the main writing was done between January and July 1818. The original intention had been that The Heart of Mid-Lothian would occupy three of the four volumes and another tale the fourth, but at some stage during composition Scott decided that Mid-Lothian should be a four-volume work.Walter Scott, The Heart of Mid-Lothian, ed. David Hewitt and Alison Lumsden (Edinburgh, 2004), 473, 480, 484–87. For the Porteous Riot in the first part of the novel Scott was able to draw on the extensive records of criminal trials arising from it, and these were published simultaneously with the novel as Criminal Trials, Illustrative of the Tale Entitled \\"The Heart of Mid-Lothian,\\" Published from the Original Record. The central business of Jeanie and Effie Deans was suggested by a true story sent (anonymously) by Mrs Helen Goldie of Dumfries. Both the riot and the story of the sisters were radically reworked by Scott for his fictional purposes. For David Deans's rhetoric Scott drew extensively on the Covenanting lives by Patrick Walker (c. 1666–1745), and for English dialect he owed much to two compilations by Francis Grose: A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, of which he owned the third edition (1796) and A Provincial Glossary (1787).Ibid., 585–94. Editions The first edition, in four volumes, was published by Archibald Constable in Edinburgh on 25 July 1818 and became available in London on the 28th. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The print run was 10,000 and the price £1 12s (£1.60).William B. Todd and Ann Bowden, Sir Walter Scott: A Bibliographical History 1796–1832 (New Castle, Delaware, 1998), 467. It is possible that Scott had some input into the text of this novel in the 1823 Novels and Tales, but the evidence is not strong.The Heart of Mid-Lothian, ed. Hewitt and Lumsden, 507–08. In the second half of 1829, though, he revised the text, concentrating on the first half of the work, for the 'Magnum' edition and provided notes and an introduction: it appeared as part of Volume 11, all of Volume 12, and part of Volume 13 in April, May, and June 1830. The standard modern edition, by David Hewitt and Alison Lumsden, was published as Volume 6 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 2004: this is based on the first edition with emendations principally from Scott's manuscript; the new Magnum material is included in Volume 25a. Plot summary The Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh The title of the book refers to the Old Tolbooth prison in Edinburgh, Scotland, at the time in the heart of the Scottish county of Midlothian. The historical backdrop was the event known as the Porteous riots. In 1736, a riot broke out in Edinburgh over the execution of two smugglers. The Captain of the City Guards, Captain John Porteous, ordered the soldiers to fire into the crowd, killing several people. Porteous was later killed by a lynch mob who stormed the Old Tolbooth. The second, and main element of the novel was based on a story Scott claimed to have received in an unsigned letter. It was about a certain Helen Walker who had travelled all the way to London by foot, to receive a royal pardon for her sister, who was unjustly charged with infanticide. Scott put Jeanie Deans in the place of Walker, a young woman from a family of highly devout Presbyterians. Jeanie goes to London, partly by foot, hoping to achieve an audience with the Queen through the influence of the Duke of Argyll. Analysis and adaptations Jeanie Deans is the first woman among Scott's protagonists, and also the first to come from the lower classes. While the heroine is idealised for her religious devotion and her moral rectitude, Scott nevertheless ridicules the moral certitude represented by the branch of Presbyterianism known as Cameronians, represented in the novel by Jeanie's father David. Also central to the novel is the early-18th-century Jacobitism, a theme found in so many of Scott's novels. Scott's sympathies can be seen in the ideal figure of the Duke of Argyle, a moderate on these issues. La Vendéenne, described by Francis Gribble as \\"a drama based on the plot of The Heart of Midlothian\\" was written for the stage debut of the celebrated French actress Rachel and was first performed 24 July 1837.\\"Rachel her stage life and her real life\\" by Frances Gribble (1911) Though, doubtless there were many unlicensed adaptations of Scott's work produced for the stage on earlier dates, The Heart of Mid-Lothian was adapted for the stage by Dion Boucicault in the 1860s. It has been adapted for the screen twice in 1914, once under the same name, and once under the title A Woman's Triumph. A television version was released in 1966. Two operas have also been based upon the novel – La Prigione di Edimburgo (Imprisoned in Edinburgh) by the Italian composer Federico Ricci (1809–1877) and Jeanie Deans by the Scottish classical composer, Hamish MacCunn (1868–1916).

Ch. 11 (49 [48]): Jeanie receives a letter from Effie, now with a place in polite English society as Lady Staunton, and enclosing the first of a series of twice-yearly remittances. On a visit to the manse Argyle sings the praises of Lady Staunton, ignorant of her identity. Ch. 12 (50 [49]): In 1751 Deans dies. Jeanie gives Butler money to buy a small estate. Ch. 13 (51 [50]): Jeanie forwards to her sister a copy of Meg's dying confession, received by chance, indicating that the baby son resulting from her relationship with Staunton was not killed. Lady Staunton arrives at the manse: on a mountain excursion with her elder nephew David she is rescued by a wild lad, who is later identified as the Whistler, Effie's son. Ch. 14 (52 [51]): At the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh, Butler encounters Staunton who is searching for his lost son. They travel together to Roseneath, landing in a cove as a storm threatens. Ch. 15 (53 [52]): Staunton is killed in an attack by Donacha Dhu na Dunaigh and his men.

Reception The Heart of Mid-Lothian was the first of the full-length Waverley novels to disappoint the majority of its reviewers.For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews see William S. Ward, Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1798‒1820: A Bibliography, 2 vols (New York and London, 1972), 2.487‒88. For an earlier annotated list see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 219‒20. Although the author's genius was not in doubt with most critics, almost all of them found the new novel prolix and the fourth volume surplus to requirements. There were objections to the plot's coincidences and to signs of hastiness. Several reviewers found it remarkable that a simple country girl like Jeanie Deans could be rendered so interesting, and her interview with Queen Caroline was generally admired. Her sister Effie was also found fascinating, though there were differing views on the moral effect of her later career.
