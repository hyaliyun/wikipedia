Achievements According to founder Stanley Urman in 2009, \\"Perhaps our most significant accomplishment was the adoption in April 2008 by the United States Congress of Resolution 185, which granted the first-ever recognition of Jewish refugees from the Arab countries. This now requires US diplomats in all Middle East negotiations to refer to a quote of what the resolution calls \\"multiple population of refugees\\" with a specific injunction that hands forth any specific reference and \\"any specific reference to the Palestinian refugees must be matched by an explicit reference to Jewish refugees\\"... our mandate is to follow that lead. Any explicit reference to Palestinians should be followed by explicit reference to Jewish refugees.\\"Urman, Seeking Justice for Displaced Jews, October 2009 Critics have suggested that JJAC's resolution was \\"a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the \\"right of return\\" to their pre-1948 homes in Israel.\\"Fischbach, 2008, \\"On 1 April 2008, the New York‚Äìbased coalition Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC) announced that the U.S. House of Representatives had passed Resolution 185 (H.Res. 185), a nonbinding \\"sense of the House\\" resolution concerning the fate of 800,000 Jews who left Arab countries in the wake of the first Arab-Israeli war of 1948, some without their property. Describing these Jews as \\"refugees,\\" the resolution called on the U.S. president to ensure that American representatives participating in international fora refer to the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries whenever mention is made of the 1948 Palestinian refugees. H.Res. 185‚Äîwhich JJAC helped to write‚Äîwas not an effort to demand compensation for Jewish property losses in the Arab world, but rather a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the \\"right of return\\" to their pre-1948 homes in Israel.\\" See also * Jewish refugees * Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries * Arab Jews External links * Main Website * 'Seeking Justice for Displaced Jews', Stanley Urman, Justice for Jews from Arab Countries, American Sephardi Federation, World Jewish Congress, transcript from Strategic Review Phase II, October 2009 * Fischbach, Michael R., \\"Palestinian Refugee Compensation and Israeli Counterclaims for Jewish Property in Arab Countries,\\" Journal of Palestine Studies 38, 1 (Autumn 2008): 6-24 Notes Category:Aliyah Category:Expulsions of Jews Category:Immigration to Israel Category:Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries Category:2002 establishments in New York (state) Category:Organizations established in 2002 Category:Jewish organizations based in the United States ","title":"Justice for Jews from Arab Countries"},{"id":"43024572","text":"The Alophini are a weevil tribe in the subfamily Entiminae.

Upon the spread of the Revolution, Abu Muslim appointed Muhammad as governor of Tabasayn, Fars and Kerman. In 755 he participated in the suppression of the rebellion of Sunpadh at Rayy, and in the next year fought against another rebel, Jawhar ibn Marar, also at Rayy (although the two events may have been mixed up in the sources, so that Muhammad may in reality have been present only at one). In 758/9, he was named governor of Egypt, a post he held until 760/1, and was then sent west against the Ibadites of Ifriqiya.

Located in Nanshan District and encircled by the Shuangjie River, Yueliangwan Boulevard, Mawan Boulevard and Qianhai Bay, Qianhai covers an area of approximately , comprising almost entirely reclaimed land. The project is expected to be completed by 2020.  Strategic positioning  According to plans made by the Qianhai administration, as the pilot district for cooperation between mainland China and Hong Kong and innovation in the service industry, Qianhai undertakes four functions: # An area that will aim to facilitate innovation in the modern service industry # An area that will aim to become a hub of modern services and modern service development # A pilot area for closer cooperation between mainland China and Hong Kong # A facilitator in the industrial reform and sustainable economic development of the Pearl River Delta  Features  = Location = Qianhai is situated in the Pearl River Delta. With the completion of railways and roads by 2020, Qianhai will be within a one-hour commuting radius of the Pearl River Delta and within a 30-minute commuting radius of Hong Kong. The main arteries of traffic in the region, including the Shenzhen-Zhongshan corridor, Shenzhen Western Port, Shenzhen North Station and Guangzhou-Shenzhen Yanjiang Highway all pass through Qianhai. = Industrial Support = The city of Shenzhen, which is where Qianhai is located, is one of the regions that has the most rapid economic development in the Pearl River Delta and mainland China. As one of the most productive cities economically in China, Shenzhen has the highest GDP per capita, foreign export volume, the number of patent applications and the number of patents owned per capita among all major cities in China.  Special Policies  The following policies were approved by the State Council on June 27, 2012. = Financial Policies = * Qianhai shall experiment with the expansion of offshore RMB fund flow-back channels. Qianhai will support the development of Hong Kong as an offshore RMB settlement centre and establish a cross-border RMB innovation zone in order to facilitate the development of RMB financial services. * Qianhai shall support the issuance of RMB loans from local banking institutions to international projects, and from Hong Kong-based banking institutions to Qianhai projects under the stipulations of the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). * Qianhai shall be supported in its efforts to establish an equity investment parent fund in Qianhai. * Hasten the internationalization of Qianhai's financial market by opening up to Hong Kong under the stipulations of CEPA * Qianhai supports the development of innovative financial instruments, and financial products that support the development of the real economy. * Hong Kong and international banking institutions shall be encouraged to establish their headquarters in Qianhai in order to quicken the pace of the internationalization of Qianhai's financial industry. = Taxation Policies = * Eligible companies registered in Qianhai are subject to a 15% preferential corporate income tax rate. * Eligible professionals who are employed in Qianhai are exempt from personal income tax. = Legal Policies = * Qianhai shall support Hong Kong arbitration agencies' establishment of affiliated agencies in Qianhai. * Qianhai shall support the joint operation of mainland and Hong Kong law firms under CEPA and its supplementary agreements. = Human Resource Policies = * Qianhai's human resource management mechanism shall be innovated and relevant policies and measures shall be formulated to attract a professional, international workforce, including but not limited to professionals from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, as well as Chinese professionals who are currently working or studying abroad or those who have returned to China. * Professionals with certification from Hong Kong shall be permitted to provide professional services, the boundary of which is confined to Qianhai and to the enterprises and residents of Qianhai. The specific policies, measures, and regulations of such services shall be formulated by relevant regulatory departments. * Professionals from Hong Kong with the certificates of Certified Public Accountant of China shall be permitted to serve as partners of mainland Chinese accounting firms.

Future Leading Industries  As a modern service industry cooperation zone, Qianhai's administration has planned to focus on finance, modern logistics, information services, technology services, and other professional services. = Finance = The Qianhai administration plans to promote innovation and partnership within the financial industry by relaxing currency flows between Qianhai and Hong Kong, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an offshore RMB settlement centre. This initiative is meant to spearhead the internationalisation of Shenzhen's capital market, as well as strengthen the partnership between securities markets in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Qianhai's financial services will aim to complement that of Hong Kong's, in a conscious effort to avoid direct competition and create a win-win situation. More specifically, Hong Kong banks will be allowed to extend commercial RMB loans to Qianhai-based onshore mainland entities. The People's Bank of China has also indicated that such loans will for the first time not be subject to the benchmark rates set by the central bank for all other loans in the rest of China. The beginning of this \\"cross-border yuan loan program has opened a new channel for the back flow of overseas yuan funds, which will increase the yuan‚Äôs global liquidity and promote its internationalisation,‚Äù according to Linan Liu, a senior strategist for greater China at Deutsche Bank AG.  Qianhai Equity Trading Centre  The Qianhai Equity Trading Centre will provide loans to Qianhai enterprises by launching RMB-denominated wealth management products (WMPs) on the Hong Kong capital market. = Modern Logistics = Qianhai has implemented preferential policies which will effectively allow logistics providers to offer improved and more flexible services across mainland China and globally.  Qianhai Bay Free Trade Port Zone  The Qianhai Bay Free Trade Port Zone is one of the vital components of the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone. The construction of 7 warehouses with a total area of 400,000m¬≤ has been completed, among which 12,000 m¬≤ are for refrigerated bonded warehouses. = Information Services = The Qianhai administration will promote the development of software and information technology services, as well as facilitate the cooperation between mainland and Hong Kong telecom operators. = Technology and Other Professional Services = Qianhai will give priority to the development of innovative technologies, creative design services, as well as professional services such as consulting and management. As industrial reform is now underway in the Pearl River Delta, Qianhai's strategic positioning includes the plan to provide manufacturers with new technologies and other professional services to support their reforming efforts and facilitate a smoother transition.  Urban Planning  With a planned area of and total construction area of 26-30 million m¬≤, Qianhai is expected to create 650,000 jobs and house 150,000 residents by 2020. According to the city blueprint, Qianhai's residents will have access to a park and greenery within , the ability to reach public transportation within , shopping malls, restaurants, and hotels within , and education and health care services within of any given point in the city. In order to attract and retain a creative workforce, the Qianhai administration has claimed that it will aim to establish an internationalised education system, as well as a Hong Kong-standard health care system. The Qianhai administration has stated that it will prioritise public transportation and sustainable development. All Qianhai buildings will meet international environmental standards, and the energy consumption of buildings will be closely monitored and controlled. There is a planned 150 million yuan investment in reforestation, and investments in clean energy, water and waste recycling as well as sustainable urban management. = Current Projects =  Qianhai Enterprise Dream Park  An example of Qianhai's future work environment, the Qianhai Enterprise Dream Park is modelled after the Silicon Valley, with 58 office buildings and a multi-purpose building that can be used as a conference and exhibition hall and an exchange platform. Companies who are planning to move in or have already moved in include the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), Hang Seng Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Mobile, etc. Although some companies have moved in, there is still ongoing construction. The area will be completed by the end of 2014.  Qianhai Youth Entrepreneur Innovation Hub  The Qianhai Youth Hub is an area that will become a community dedicated to the facilitation of innovation in young entrepreneurs, providing them with sources of venture capital, the advantage of starting up in one of the most active economies in China, and the opportunity to network with companies as well as like-minded individuals from abroad, particularly Hong Kong youths. The cost of research and startup in the Qianhai Youth Hub will be partially subsidised. The prioritised industries in this area are consistent with Qianhai's overall blueprint, including innovative technology, information technology, modern logistics, and cultural and artistic innovation. The development of professional services such as finance, accounting, and law, as well as computer science, e-commerce, statistical analysis, animation, new media, 3-D printing, design, virtual reality, and clean energy are strongly supported by the Qianhai administration. The Hub will have facilities that help youth entrepreneurs obtain funds from venture capital, public funds, and subsidies from the Qianhai administration, providing them with the resources to either initiate an idea or continue developing their innovation. In addition, the Qianhai Youth Hub is situated beside the Qianhai Enterprise Dream Park, giving the youth entrepreneurs a chance to network with companies, offers for careers, and venture capital. In addition to a lab area with facilities such as recording studios and 3-D printing labs, participants in the Qianhai Youth Hub will have access to the facilities in most public labs for free. There is an instructional building where professors and professionals give seminars, career advice, or provide professional guidance to youth entrepreneurs, and an exhibition hall for the participants' work and ideas. International and Hong Kong youth participation in this hub is strongly supported by the Qianhai administration. This community will be managed by the Qianhai administration, the Hong Kong Federation of Youths, and the Shenzhen Youth Federation. This project will be completed by the end of 2014.

It is romanized as Chi in Wade‚ÄìGiles, and Gat in Cantonese. Ji is the 195th most common surname in China, with a population of 490,000. It is listed 190th in the Song dynasty classic text Hundred Family Surnames. Demographics As of 2008, Ji Âêâ is the 195th most common surname in China, shared by 490,000 people, or 0.04% of the Chinese population. It is concentrated in the provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, and Hainan, which together account for 50% of the total, including 15% in Jiangsu alone. Origins According to tradition, there are two main origins of the Ji Âêâ surname: 1\\\\. From the ancient state of Southern Yan. Bo Tiao (‰ºØÂÑµ), said to a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, was enfeoffed at the Southern Yan (in modern Weihui, Henan). Bo Tiao's ancestral name was Ji Âßû, and his descendants later dropped the Â•≥ radical from their surname, which became Ji Âêâ. 2\\\\. From Xi Jia (ÂÖÆÁî≤), a top minister of King Xuan of Zhou (reigned 827‚Äì782 BC), during the Western Zhou dynasty. He led the Zhou army to defeat the Xianyun tribes of the north and the Dongyi people of the Huai River. His military feat was extolled in several songs collected in the Classic of Poetry. His courtesy name was Jifu (ÂêâÁî´), and some of his descendants adopted Ji Âêâ, the main character of his courtesy name, as their surname. A third possible origin was the legendary Jiyi tribe (ÂêâÂ§∑Ê∞è). Some descendants of the tribe were said to have adopted Ji, the first character of Jiyi, as their surname.

Formed plastiglomerate merges with surrounding sediment to create a compositionally different sediment layer(3).The emergence of this new layer is being used as physical evidence of a marker horizon for an Anthropocene Epoch(4). Plastiglomerate is a term that was proposed by Patricia Corcoran, Charles J. Moore and Kelly Jazvac for a stone that contains mixtures of sedimentary grains, and other natural debris (e.g. shells, wood) that is held together by hardened molten plastic. It has been considered a potential marker of the Anthropocene, an informal epoch of the Quaternary proposed by some social scientists, environmentalists, and geologists. Origin Plastiglomerates form along shorelines where natural sedimentary grains and organic debris are agglutinated by melted plastic created during campfire burning. They have been reported from Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii. Depositional environment Plastiglomerate could potentially form a marker horizon of human pollution on the geologic record. and may survive as future fossils. Plastiglomerate may also conceivably form in plastic-polluted regions affected by lava flows or forest fires. They have been found on the surface as well as beneath the sand. This suggests that plastiglomerates are being actively deposited into the sedimentary record. Some geophysicists and geologists speculate that plastiglomerates will not persist in the fossil record, however, or that they might \\" to a source of oil from whence they came, given the right conditions of burial\\". \\"In situ\\" plastiglomerate forms where plastic melts and fills in rock cavities. \\"Clastic\\" plastiglomerate are smaller solitary pieces that form where larger fused items become fragmented by waves. Plastiglomerate is more dense than particles that are solely composed of plastic, which gives them greater potential to become buried and preserved in the rock record. Plastiglomerate from Kamilo Beach displayed in the exhibition One Planet in Museon (The Hague, The Netherlands). Plastiglomerates have been featured at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History; Oakville Galleries in Oakville, Ontario, Canada; Louis B. James Gallery in New York City; Carleton University Gallery in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Prosjektrom Normanns, Stavanger, Norway; and Museon in The Hague, Netherlands. Museon has probably the largest piece in its possession, as it is more than 1m long and 50 cm wide. History Charles Moore, a sea captain and oceanographer for the Algalita Marine Research Institute in Long Beach, California, discovered this substance in 2006 while surveying Kamilo Beach on the Big Island of Hawai‚Äôi. Geology professor, Dr. Patricia Corcoran and Visual artist professor, Kelly Jazvac of the University of Western Ontario investigated the samples on Kamilo Beach in 2012 where they also coined the term \\"plastiglomerate\\". Approximately one-fifth of the plastiglomerates found at Kamilo Beach consisted of fishing debris, one quarter consisted of broken lid containers, and one half consisted of plastic \\"confetti\\". The plastiglomerate at Kamilo Beach was more likely created from human campfires than from molten lava flows.

The related term Boerehater () has been used to describe a person who hates, prejudices or criticises Boers or Afrikaners. These terms were initially applied to British people perceived as prejudiced against the Boers, in the context of political conflict between the British and the Boers in southern Africa which culminated in the British defeat of the Boers in the Second Boer War. Accusations of Boerehaat have subsequently been made by Afrikaner nationalists to exploit historical British prejudice against the Boers for political gain. They have applied the term Boerehater to anyone who criticised them or opposed their interests in the Cape Colony, including English-speaking white South Africans, dissident Afrikaners and black South Africans. Etymology and origin political cartoon by W. H. Schr√∂der in The Lantern depicting a Boer petitioning Britain for continued independence. The personification of annexation is associated with prosperity, independence with anarchy and bankruptcy. Boerehaat is an Afrikaans word meaning hatred of the Boers, or Afrikaners as they became known after the Second Boer War. The related term Boerehater () has been used to describe a person who hates, prejudices or criticises the Boers, or Afrikaners. The disdain of the British people for the Boers was recorded as early as the 18th century. The Boers were portrayed to the British public in literature and editorial cartoons as uncivilised and cruel, especially in order to obtain the support of the British public for British imperialism and the Second Boer War. The English term Boer-hater was used in a political context in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, the use of their language in Parliament in particular. =Second Boer War= British politician James Bryce, writing about the attitude of uitlanders (English-speaking immigrants) towards the Boer authorities in the independent South African Republic during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush following the discovery of gold in 1886, states: \\"English became the general spoken tongue not only of Johannesburg, but of the mining districts generally. Hearing nothing but English spoken, seeing nothing all round them that was not far more English than Dutch, though English with a half-colonial, half-American tinge, it was natural that the bulk of the Uitlanders should deem themselves to be in a country which had become virtually English, and should see something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors.\\" British critic of imperialism John A. Hobson writes about attitudes towards senior Boer officials: \\"Regarding the higher officials, the opinion of all, save the blind Boer-hater, is that they are a fairly competent and fairly honest body of men.\\" Animosity between the British and the Boers intensified in the run-up to the Second Boer War fought from 1899 to 1902, and continued thereafter. One British volunteer soldier sent home a letter explicitly detailing the British soldiers' hatred of their Boer enemy: \\"The Cape Dutch and Boers are a dirty treacherous lot and as soon as the Transvaal is subdued and the beggars (those that survive) trek farther out of our way the better. We do hate them down here like poison. The rascally dirty varmints, they must be exterminated; the country swarms with them and their dirty compatriots the German Jew\\". Approximately 27,000 Boer women and children died in British concentration camps, resulting in a long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners. The British won the war, but anti-British sentiment contributed to the rise of Afrikaner nationalism and the pro-Afrikaner National Party was the ruling party of South Africa from 1948 until 1994, the apartheid era. Apartheid era During the apartheid era, the Afrikaners dominated in number of voters, politics and civil service, while English-speaking white South Africans dominated economically. The Afrikaners separated themselves from the rest of the population, both black people and English-speaking whites. In 1971 sociologist Heribert Adam writes \\"the historical friction between the English and Afrikaans-speaking populace is gradually being replaced by class contradictions within the two groups.\\" Historical friction was revived and exploited by the ruling National Party for political gain however. In 1973 Edward Feit, professor of political science at the University of Michigan, writes in the American Journal of Sociology: \\"Recent political campaigns have shown that the old bogey of Boerehaat still has its charms for an Afrikaaner majority.\\" The National Party, under the leadership of B. J. Vorster, appealed to the emotions of Afrikaner voters by depicting English-speaking white citizens as being guilty of Boerehaat. The National Party and its political mouthpiece Die Burger waged a \\"Boerehaat campaign\\" during a by-election in Oudtshoorn in 1972, depicting their United Party opposition, once supported by the majority of English-speaking voters, as Boerehaters, and won. The Nationalists also used the term to censure members of the Progressive Federal Party opposition party formed in 1977. After interviewing various South Africans including government officials during the early 1980s, American historian Otto Scott writes: \\"This sort of xenophobic solidarity perceived the opposition as Boer haters.\\" White South African critics of apartheid, such as liberal politician Alex Boraine and Afrikaner anti-apartheid activist Beyers Naud√©, were labelled unpatriotic Boerehaters by Nationalists and the Afrikaans press in an attempt to discredit them. White dissidents were also associated with the rooi gevaar (\\"communist threat\\"). (obituary of Frederik van Zyl Slabbert) South African poet and writer Guy Butler was called a Boerehater by Afrikaners for his promotion of English-language literature and his opposition to Afrikaner nationalism and the National Party. English-speaking film critics were more lenient towards Afrikaans-language films lest they be accused of Boerehaat. According to The Star film critic Robert Greig, \\"An apology situation developed with the English-language newspapers who tended not to slam Afrikaans films because they didn't want to be accused of boerehaat (Boer-hater).\\" According to film critic Barry Ronge, \\"The cries of boerehaat come from the industry itself when they feel they are not getting 'support'.\\" Post-apartheid era In 1995 ANC politician Zola Skweyiya was accused of Boerehaat by Die Burger for disrespecting the Afrikaans official language in Parliament. In 1998 Jaap Marais, Afrikaner nationalist leader of the right- wing Herstigte Nasionale Party, described the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission as an exercise in Boerehaat. In 2011 South African politician Julius Malema was found guilty of hate speech in the High Court in Johannesburg for repeatedly singing the anti-apartheid protest song \\"Shoot the Boer\\" at political gatherings. Civil rights organisation AfriForum accused Malema of inciting violence against white South Africans, citing the ongoing spate of farm attacks (the literal meaning of Boer is \\"farmer\\"). Judge Colin Lamont ruled that Malema's singing of the song in a post-apartheid South Africa was \\"derogatory, dehumanising and hurtful\\" to the Afrikaner minority group. Lamont said \\"People must develop new customs and rejoice in a developing society by giving up old practices which are hurtful to members who live in that society with them.\\" In an incident reminiscent of the National Party's Boerehaat propaganda campaign during apartheid, ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa urged disgruntled residents of the Limpopo province to vote in the 2014 general election otherwise \\"the Boers will come back to control us\\". Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Mulder described his remarks as \\"primitive scare tactics\\" and \\"racist and polarising\\". Sociologist Michael Neocosmos notes that critics of the ruling ANC can similarly be labelled as \\"standing outside the state-defined national consensus\\", with for example ad hominem accusations of racism and disloyalty replacing accusations of Boerehaat and communist sympathies which are hard to defend.

Built in 1706 by Prince Charles of Denmark, in 1780 it was converted into a clothing factory before becoming a teacher training institution in 1791. After serving as a hospital in the early 19th century, in 1828 it became N√∏rrebro's first theatre until it was destroyed by fire in 1833. Today the name subsists in Bl√•g√•rds Plads, Bl√•g√•rdsgade andrelated developments in the area. Background From the end of the 17th century, a park and a summer residence based on Italian traditions were developed just to the north of the former city limits of Copenhagen. In 1706 Prince Charles, the brother of King Frederick IV, acquired the estate where he soon built a one-storey country house with a mansard roof in the modern French style. Country house The house overlooked the waters of Peblinge S√∏ with pavilions and gazebos in the surrounding park. Originally known simply as Prinsens Have (The Prince's Garden), the house was soon referred to as Bl√•g√•rd (literally Blue House) as a result of its blue-tiled roofs and the roofs of all the additional buildings. Today the name subsists in Bl√•g√•rds Plads and related developments in the area. In order to satisfy his interests in hunting and lavish entertaining, Prince Charles laid out a magnificent French Baroque garden with fountains, symmetrically positioned trees and fish ponds. The house itself had a conservatory or winter garden decorated with fine works of art and elegant furniture. There was also a prayer room with 35 Biblical pictures created by Hendrick Krock. With its two large glass doors, the lounge commanded fine views of the lakes and Copenhagen beyond. Later developments When he died in 1729, Prince Charles left the estate to his sister Sophie Hedevig. Princess Sophia Hedwig bequeathed Bl√•g√•rd outside to Carl Adolph von Plessen. Thereafter it passed into the hands Count Conrad Holck, a favourite of King Christian VII. The king soon befriended a number of dancers from the Royal Danish Theatre, especially St√∏vlet-Cathrine, inviting them to stay at Bl√•g√•rd to take part in his festivities. In 1780, the building was converted for use as a clothing factory until in 1791 it became the first teacher training college in Denmark known as Bl√•g√•rds Seminarium. In 1807, the house was used as in infirmary for those wounded during the Bombardment of Copenhagen. The English seriously damaged the gardens, felling the trees for firewood. In the 1820s, the former country house which had fallen into disrepair was acquired by Philippo Pettoletti from Venice who renovated it as a playhouse. He opened his Pantomimetheater in 1828, the first theatre in the N√∏rrebro area. His pantomime and circus presentations came to an abrupt end on 14 April 1893 when the building was completely destroyed by fire in 1833.

First published as a blog of fake historical documents parodying British public information posters of the 1970s, a collected book was published in 2014, and the Scarfolk Annual was released in 2019. Scarfolk is depicted as a bleak, post-industrial landscape through unsettling images of urban life; Littler's output belongs to the genres of hauntology and dystopian satire; his psychologically disturbing form of humour has been likened to the writings of George Orwell and J. G. Ballard. A television series co-written by Will Smith was described as \\"in the works\\" in 2018.  Description  Scarfolk, which is forever locked in the 1970s, is a satire not only on that decade but also on contemporary events. It touches on themes of totalitarianism, suburban life, occultism and religion, school and childhood, as well as social attitudes such as racism and sexism. Scarfolk was initially presented as a fake blog which purportedly releases artefacts from archive of the fictional town council, Scarfolk Council. Artefacts include public information literature, out-of-print books, record and cassette sleeves, advertisements, television programme screenshots, household products, and audio and video, many of which suggest brands and imagery recognisable from the period. Additionally, artefacts are usually accompanied by short fictional vignettes which are also presented as factual and introduce residents of Scarfolk. The public information literature often ends with the strapline: \\"For more information please reread.\\" Aesthetic The aesthetic is utilitarian, inspired by public sector materials in the United Kingdom such as public information films and posters issued by the Central Office of Information and British Transport Films during the 1970s. Digitally altered photographs and illustrations parody publicity campaigns of the period such as Protect and Survive, Charley Says and The Finishing Line, as well as contemporary Penguin and Pelican paperback book covers and children's toys such as Action Man. Images are altered to convey a sinister or potentially violent message, and are deliberately distressed to appear worn and dog-eared. Writing in The Daily Telegraph author Richard Littler stated that his Scarfolk style was the product of several influences, including George Orwell, television programmes such as Monty Python's Flying Circus and The League of Gentlemen, satirist Chris Morris, and the work of cartoonists Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman. Littler considers Scarfolk as part hauntology, an aesthetic movement that draws on \\"the darker aspects of the 1970s\\". Littler also drew on the satirical 2002 television science series Look Around You. Littler has said \\"I was always scared as a kid, always frightened of what I was faced with. ‚Ä¶ You‚Äôd walk into WHSmith... and see horror books with people‚Äôs faces melting. Kids‚Äô TV included things like Children of the Stones, a very odd series you just wouldn‚Äôt get today. I remember a public information film made by some train organisation in which a children‚Äôs sports day was held on train tracks and, one by one, they were killed. It was insane. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just taking it to the next logical step.\\"  Media controversies  In January 2014, the London Evening Standard published an article by Charles Saatchi, which accidentally included the cover of a Scarfolk book called Eating Children: Population Control & The Food Crisis instead of the intended Jonathan Swift publication A Modest Proposal (1729). In July 2018, a parody Scarfolk poster was mistakenly featured in the UK government's in-house magazine, Civil Service Quarterly, as part of a serious article about the history of government communications. The inclusion of poster, which bore the slogan \\"If you suspect your child has RABIES don't hesitate to SHOOT\\", attracted some media attention.  Reception  Scarfolk has received positive reactions from the public and media in the United Kingdom and abroad. GQ Magazine called it one of \\"The 100 Funniest Things in the History of the Internet\\". Reviews and interviews with Littler have appeared in publications such as Creative Review, The Independent, The Telegraph, Stylenoir, and The Honest Ulsterman, and have been featured by popular online sites such as Boing Boing and Dangerous Minds. Design Week called Scarfolk \\"a queasy, unsettling provincial place\\". Publications =Discovering Scarfolk= A book called Discovering Scarfolk, which tells the story of a family trapped in the town, was published in October 2014 by Ebury Press. It is a guide to all aspects of Scarfolk and covers the \\"frenzied archive of Daniel Bush, whose sons 'disappeared' in Scarfolk in 1970.\\" Littler has said that the book \\"attempts to guide you through the darkness by making light of the contradictions and it promises not to unnerve you. Well, not too much anyway.\\" Boing Boing's co- editor Cory Doctorow said \\"[Discovering Scarfolk] looks to be absolutely genius.\\" Digital Arts reviewed Discovering Scarfolk favorably with \\"We've seen so many blogs turned into books that it should probably be its own genre, but Discovering Scarfolk is one of the few to stand on its own and deserve to be more than a ill-conceived Christmas present.\\" Starburst gave Discovering Scarfolk nine out of ten stars, calling it \\"a hilarious novel filled with so- creepy-it‚Äôs funny illustrations and a relentlessly silly back story.\\" In his review of The Advisory Circles From Out Here (2014), musician DJ Food remarked both From Out Here and Discovering Scarfolk define \\"a good portion of the visual stimulus associated with the hauntological genre.\\" =Scarfolk Annual= A follow-up book to Discovering Scarfolk entitled Scarfolk Annual was published by HarperCollins on 17 October 2019. It satirises the British comic annual format and the cover resembles the BBC Publications annual based on the children's TV show Play School.

The average math and verbal scores were 495 and 497, respectively, for rural students, while urban test- takers averaged 499 and 507, respectively. Pennsylvania's SAT composite score ranked low on the national scale in 2004. The composite SAT score of 1,003 left Pennsylvania ranking 44 out of the 50 states and Washington, DC. The Pennsylvania Department of Education reported that 71 percent of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania chose to continue their education after high school in 2003, whereas 79 percent of urban high school graduates opted to continue their education. AP Courses In 2013, Mifflinburg Area High School offered 8 Advanced Placement (AP) courses at a higher cost than regular courses. Students have the option of taking College Board approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. The school normally retains $9 of that fee as a rebate to help with administrative costs. In 2012, the fee was $89 per test per pupil. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Mifflinburg Area High School 13% of students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data Advanced Achievement - Mifflinburg Area High School, December 2013 *2014 - 9 courses with just 33% of pupils who took the course earning a 3 or better on the associated AP exam. *2015 - 9 courses with just 29% earning a 3 or better on the associated AP exam. *2016 - 9 courses with 53% earned a 3 or better on the AP exam. Cost of the exam $93 per pupil.College Board, Fees and Fee Reductions, 2016 Graduation requirements Among Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts, graduation requirements widely vary. The Mifflinburg Area School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 22 credits to graduate, including: 3 units of math, 4 or 5 units of English, 3 units of social studies, 3 units of science, one unit of economics or consumer economics, Physical Education and electives.Mifflinburg Area School Board, Mifflinburg Area School District Student Handbook 2017-18, 2017 Credit is awarded for high school level courses taken in the middle school and are noted on the high school transcript. Since 1984, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2020, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the respective Keystone Exams for each course. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams have replaced the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exams. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. The original intent was to gradually add seven more exams including civics and geometry. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that eliminated developing any more Keystone Exams in other subjects.PA General Assembly, Act 6 of 2017, June 21, 2017 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP instead of passing the Keystone Exams. School district superintendents have the discretion to graduate up to 10% of pupils who do not pass the exams or project. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed House Bill 202, which makes modifications of the Keystone Exam mandates for students who attend VoTech and Career Tech schools. These pupils will be allowed to use alternate assessments or industry-based certifications. ACE Mifflinburg Area School District does not offer a dual enrollment program with area colleges, but the high school students do have access to Bloomsburg University's Summer College and Advanced College Experience (ACE) during the summer of their sophomore, junior and senior years (after high school graduation). Tuition is deeply discounted to 75% of the regular student rate. Successful students earn college credits that can be transferred to other Pennsylvania public colleges and universities through the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Center (PA TRAC) system. School safety and bullying The Mifflinburg Area High School administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the high school in 2012. Additionally, there was one assault on a student and two sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in seven incidents at the schools, with zero arrests. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Mifflinburg Area School Board has provided the district's antibullying policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Mifflinburg Area School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the district received $198,569 and $59,896 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $258,465. Among the public school districts in Union County the highest award was given to Mifflinburg Area School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Tuition Students who live in the Mifflinburg Area School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Mifflinburg Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are: Elementary School - $8,004, High School - $9,186. Wellness policy Mifflinburg Area School Board established a district-wide Student Wellness policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Mifflinburg Area High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Mifflinburg Area School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available at the High School to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Beginning with the 2017-18 school year, high school students are mandated to receive a dose of MCV meningococcal conjugate vaccine for 12th grade entry. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. ;Naloxone In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. Extracurriculars Mifflinburg Area School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. The district spent over $500,000 in 2013-14 (excluding facilities and transportation costs) providing these activities.Mifflinburg Area School Board, Mifflinburg Area School District General Fund Annual Budget 2013-14, 2013 Eligibility for participation is determined by Mifflinburg Area School Board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA).

According to Distant this species is found almost throughout the Ethiopian region, but apparently it is absent in Madagascar. He first published its description under the name Poecilopsaltria leopardina in \\"Transactions of the Entomological Society of London\\" 1881, p. 630\\\\. He mentions its occurrence in the Transvaal in the Lydenburg district, in Mashonaland near Gadzima, in Nyasaland at Zomba and Fort Johnston and throughout East Africa. The male species produce's a monotonous call of piercing shrillness, and the introductory notes have a distinctive throbbing sound. The females respond by clicking, produced by a flicking of the wings. Distant notes that Guy Marshall collected specimens from the Machabel tree (Brachystegia boehmii Taub.). In the vicinity of Victoria Falls the species is closely associated with mopane trees, feeding on the roots and emerging after the first rains. They normally call from branches near the middle of the tree, well camouflaged against predators when settled on the rough bark. The communal sound starts up during the heat of day, rises to a peak at dusk and may carry on for several hours after sunset; this calling in concert produces a deafening noise. The Marula tree is also favoured for its sap. Cicadas squirt a constant stream of processed sap from the tips of their abdomens, deftly directing the jet away from the tree.pers. comm. Martin H.

James Atkinson traveled to London from Cumberland in the far north of England, with detailed recipes of toiletries and fragrances that he had concocted, along with bear's grease balm and a real bear. They created fragrances, toiletries and cosmetics at their factory at the Eonia Works, Southwark Park Road, Rotherhithe, London.

Among his writings are a number of hymns which have been translated into English.The English Hymnal, 1907; p. 945 Life Charles Coffin was born 4 October 1676 at Buzancy, Ardennes in the Duchy of Rheim and educated at College du Plessis. In 1701, he was appointed chief assistant to Charles Rollin, principal of the Coll√®ge de Beauvais. He succeeded Rollin as principal in 1712. That same year he was entrusted with the funeral oration for Louis, Duke of Burgundy, the father of Louis XV.\\"Charles Coffin\\", The Canterbury Dictionary of Hymnology In 1718. he became rector of the University of Paris, a post which he held until his death. Hymns Coffin published in 1727 some of his Latin poems, for which he was already noted, and in 1736 the bulk of his hymns appeared in the Paris Breviary of that year, an edition of which was published in 1838 at Oxford by John Henry Newman.\\"Coffin, Charles\\", the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, (Frank Leslie Cross, Elizabeth A.

John Chandler later translated to the hymn On Jordan's Bank the Baptist's Cry set to the tune Winchester New for use at Matins during Advent.Chandler, John. The Hymns of the Primitive Church (London: John W. Parker, 1837), pp. 40-41 Chandler also translated Coffin's The Advent of Our King. Among his other works is an ode in praise of the wines of Champagne. This work is a version of a similar poem in which B√©nigne Grenan, professor at Harcourt College, praised the pre-eminence of Burgundy wine, and that one of Charles Coffin's Jansenist friends, Marc-Antoine Hersan, had had fun reciting one evening at a dinner. Jansenism While the papal bull Unigenitus condemned Jansenism, many in France interpreted it as an attack on the prerogatives of the French church. The University of Paris and the provincial Parlements were hotbeds of opposition. The University was known to harbor Jansenist sympathizers; the Parlement of Paris went so far as to threatened to confiscate the temporalities of the Archbishop. As rector of the University and clerk to the Parlement of Paris, even Coffin's hymns were viewed by some with suspicion. Death Coffin died of pneumonia in Paris 20 June 1749. Due to his persistence in appealing against the apostolic constitution Unigenitus, under instructions from the Archbishop, who wished to make an example, the parish rector of Saint-√âtienne-du-Mont, refused to administer last rites to him, or give him a Christian burial Robert Darnton observed that, \\"To deny the final absolution of sins to Christians on their deathbed was, in the eyes of many, to send them straight to Purgatory, an unforgivable abuse of royal and ecclesiastical authority.‚Äù Four thousand Parisians joined the funeral procession. Because the crown had supported the suppression of the Jansenists, Danton notes that the religious rite took on political overtones. The Parlement of Paris subsequently issued an official and strong ‚Äúremonstrance‚Äù to the king. Richard J. Janet sees the resulting popular demonstrations as contributing to the growing disenchantment with the monarchy that would later play into the coming Revolution. Coffin left a legacy to the college of Beauvais, and founded awards at the University of Paris. =Postscript= In December 1750 Coffin's nephew, became seriously ill, and he asked for the last sacraments from the parish priest, but he too, was refused. However, on this occasion Parlement had more time to intervene. The Parliament summoned the parish priest and ordered him to exercise his ministry, but the latter invoked the instructions of the archbishop. His insolence is such that the Attorney General incarcerates him two days at the Conciergerie and sentenced him to three pounds of alms for the bread of the prisoners. Parlement negotiated directly with the Archbishop of Paris. A compromise was found, \\"worthy of such a great friend of the Jesuits.\\" Another pastor was sent to the patient to take his confession, but without asking him anything about the \\"present disputes\\" and, in view of his confession, the parish priest of Saint-√âtienne-du-Mont administered the last rites. Coffin's nephew died 10 January.

Through the responses to his ideas by P.A. Vyazemsky, K.N. Batyushkov and Pushkin, who called him \\"the heavy bibrus\\", Bobrov‚Äôs name was saved from complete oblivion. Toward the end of his life, Bobrov developed a drinking habit and lived in poverty. He died from tuberculosis in St. Petersburg and was buried at the Volkovo Cemetery.–ó–∞–π–æ–Ω—Ü –õ. –û. –ë–æ–±—Ä–æ–≤ // –°–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π XVIII –≤–µ–∫–∞. ‚Äî –í—ã–ø. 1. ‚Äî –õ.: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, 1988. ‚Äî –°. 96‚Äî99. Literary activity Bobrov wrote dense, heavy material, as witnessed by the titles of his huge books, e.g. \\"The Coming of Midnight, or Contemplation of the Fame, Deeds and Wisdom of the Crowned (literally \\"Porphyrebearing\\"), Military and Civil Geniuses of Russia, Followed by Accounts of Didactic, Erotic or Various Other Natures in Verse and Prose\\" (). In addition to long poems such as \\"Taurica, or My Summer Day at the Taurian Chersonesus‚Äú (), the already mentioned \\"Coming of Midnight\\", and \\"The Old Night of the Universe, or the Fartravelling Blind‚Äú (), Bobrov wrote and translated odes as well as works of moral instruction. He was one of the first in Russia to take an interest in English literature. He was a mystic, but his mysticism was a clear and human one; his mystic feeling fed on literature and awoke in him a predilection for symbolism which often led him to (occasionally extreme) exaggeration.–†‚Äî–≤ –í. –ë–æ–±—Ä–æ–≤ // –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å. ‚Äî –¢. 3: –ë–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–∫—É—Ä-–ë—è–∫—Å—Ç–µ—Ä. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1908. ‚Äî –°. 124‚Äî125. Bobrov's poetic prowess was taken note of by many of his contemporaries. Derzhavin, especially, \\"was in raptures\\" about his works, Krylov wrote in 1822 on the \\"wilful and unbridled\\" within \\"Bobrov‚Äôs genius\\", K√ºchelbecker spoke of the \\"greatness\\" of his talent, and Griboyedov sharpened his own artistic mastership by reading and rereading the famous \\"Taurica\\".–ú–∏–Ω—á–∏–∫ –°. –°. –ì—Ä–∏–±–æ–µ–¥–æ–≤ –∏ –ö—Ä—ã–º. ‚Äî –°–∏–º—Ñ–µ—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª—å: –ë–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å- –ò–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º, 2011. ‚Äî –°. 143, 184‚Äî186. However, beside such praise, he also met with the opposite: long before Vyazemsky, Batyushkov and Pushkin, Radishchev mentioned him with derision in his poem \\"Bova\\". His contemporaries simply could not find value in Bobrov the literary theorist with strong and even farreaching views. In his time Bobrov felt the full harshness of the struggle between the perception of thought and its adequate expression in language. \\"Speech is light, but how delusive! Reaching us through our ears it often looses its rightful sense.\\" He boldly coined neologisms, declaring that \\"Usual and worn-out expressions, it seems, might not give to the word such strength as fresh, bold expressions invented with patriotic endeavour.\\" Many new words were coined by him, most of them clumsily complicated and in bad taste; some, however, entered into colloquial and literary speech. Most often he used slavianisms (neologisms derived from Slavic languages), which brought him the sympathies of Shishkov, but made him the laughing stock of the karamzinists. He upheld that \\"rhyme should never hold up the musical qualities of a poem... [it] often serves as a deflection of the most beautiful feelings and the most refined thoughts, but almost always destroys the very soul of the work\\", if the author makes the slightest concession to it. Long before Benediktov, Balmont and the symbolists of the end of the 19th century, Bobrov felt the yearning for the \\"awful sound\\" and the \\"unknown speech\\" and was among the first to uphold the beauty of blank verse.–ê–ª—å—Ç—à—É–ª–ª–µ—Ä –ú. –ì. –°. –°. –ë–æ–±—Ä–æ–≤ –∏ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–æ—ç–∑–∏—è –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–∞ XVIII ‚Äî –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ XIX –≤. // –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ XVIII –≤. –≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏—Ü–∏–∑–º–∞. ‚Äî –ú. ‚Äî –õ.: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, 1964. ‚Äî –°. 224‚Äî246.

The differentiated cells have many properties of neurons, including neurofilaments. The cells, due to passaging since initial collection, can exhibit responses to toxins that differ from those of neuronal cells in a live organism.

Description and history The Adams Memorial Building stands near the west end of Derry's central business district, on the north side of West Broadway (New Hampshire Route 102) at its junction with Maple Street. It is a two-story masonry structure set on a raised basement, built out of brick with granite and wooden trim. Stone beltcourses separate the first and second floors, and the second floor and the elaborate roof cornice. The main facade is three bays wide, articulated by brick pilasters with stone capitals. The main entrance is in the center bay, recessed in a round arch framed by a projecting cornice supported by clustered columns. Upper level windows are set in large round- arch openings. On the left side, facing Maple Street, is a single-story single-bay round projecting section. The building was designed by Lawrence, Massachusetts, architect George G. Adams, and completed in 1904. It originally housed a variety of municipal offices and the local library. Local events are occasionally held in the theater (\\"opera house\\") of the building, located on the upper level. The building is an unusually elaborate Colonial Revival structure for what was at the time a fairly small town (population c. 3,600 in 1920). It was twice damaged by fire (1914 and 1927), necessitating rebuilding of portions of its interior.

History Dorking RFC was founded in 1921 with a single team; a second team followed in 1928. The club ceased to play in 1940 due to the demands of World War II. It was re- established in 1946, initially with a single team, but grew rapidly as 2nd (1947), 3rd (1948) and 4th (1954) teams were formed. NT) The club moved to The Big Field in Brockham in 1972 when it was granted a 50-year lease by the National Trust. This was extended with another 50-year lease in 2011. The first youth team - Dorking Schoolboys XV - was formed in 1951 with a single team of 13- to 18-year-olds. By 1965 this had grown to the point of splitting into three age banded teams. A mini section (for girls and boys aged 6-12) followed in 1980 and the first ladies team in 1988. Dorking youth teams have twice triumphed in the National under-17 cup, winning the main competition in 2007 and the Shield in 20012. The 1st XV was promoted to the RFU National Leagues (National League 3 London & SE) in 2009 and at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season won promotion to National League 2 South, finishing fourth in 2014‚Äì15, their highest league position to date.

Plays were primarily in the Hindustani language (especially the Urdu dialect), as well as Gujarati to an extent. After its beginning in Bombay, it soon developed into various travelling theatre companies, which toured across India, especially north and western India (now Gujarat and Maharashtra), popularizing proscenium-style theatre in regional languages. Entertainment-driven and incorporating musical theatre and folk theatre, in early 1900s, some Parsi theatre producers switched to new media like bioscope and subsequently many became film producers. The theatre diminished in popularity, with arrival of talkies era in Hindi cinema in 1930s. Post-independence, it experienced a revival in the 1950s, much like theatre in the rest of the India. History The British community in Bombay had been staging theatre in English language for sometime by the mid-19th century. Parsis were a prominent business community in the city. In early 1850s, the students of Elphinstone College in Mumbai had formed a dramatic society and started performing Shakespeare. The first Parsi Theatre company called \\"PƒÅrsƒ´ NƒÅ·π≠ak Ma·πá·∏çali\\" performed their first play Roostum Zabooli and Sohrab in 1853, followed by King Afrasiab and Rustom Pehlvan and PƒÅd≈õƒÅh Faredun. By 1860 over 20 Parsi theatre groups were formed in Mumbai. Sharmistha Gooptu and Bhaumik identify Indo-Persian/Islamicate culture as a major influence on Parsi theatre. Up until the early 20th century, Urdu was the most widely used language in Parsi theater, due to the influence of Urdu poetry. The One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) also had a strong influence on Parsi theater, which performed \\"Persianate adventure-romances\\", which in turn were later adapted into early Bollywood films. The early plays in Parsi theatre presented Indianized versions of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays, by turning them into folk performances, with dozens of songs added in. Soon Indian legends, epic and mythological tales made an appearance as source material. As Parsi theatre companies started travelling across North India, they employed native writers to churn out scripts in Hindustani language, mix of Hindi and Urdu.Hansen, p. 75 Later Parsi plays \\"blended realism and fantasy, music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of melodrama\\". For mass appeal the plays incorporated humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and stagecraft. The success of Parsi theatre lead to the development of theatre in regional languages notably modern Gujarati theatre, Marathi theatre and Hindi theatre. Later it led to the development of Hindi cinema (Bollywood), the effect of Parsi theatre is still evident in the Masala film genre of Indian cinema, and especially in Bollywood film songs. According to screenwriter and lyricist Javed Akhtar, Urdu Parsi theatre's ghazal, thumri and kajri traditions were the basis for Bollywood's filmi- ghazal, thumri and kajri styles of music. Parsi theatre was also popular in South-East Asia, where it was known as Wyang Parsi and often imitated. In 1981, Mumbai-based theatre director Nadira Babbar, started her theatre group Ekjute (Together), with the production of Yahudi Ki Ladki, which revived the Parsi theatre style, and is considered one of its finest.

These states include Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. History =Pre-Grange= In February 1933, the Town and Village Insurance Company Services worked under an agreement with Grange Insurance Services, Inc. to write automobile insurance for members of the Ohio State Grange. Grange Insurance Services, Inc. served as a general agent in Ohio and conducted all sales efforts and promotions. Town and Village Insurance Services then wrote business under a special automobile policy provided by the New Century Casualty Company of Chicago, Illinois. =Early history= On March 25, 1935, Grange Mutual Casualty Company was formed as a non-profit corporation under the General Code of Ohio and as such, assumed the book of business from Town and Village Insurance Services. Its principal business was writing property and casualty insurance coverage for policyholders as a mutual insurance company.

In March 1995, a new stock subsidiary of Grange Mutual named Grange Indemnity Insurance Company was formed in Ohio and currently writes primarily renewal non-standard automobile policies. In 2002, Grange Mutual Casualty Company partnered with Integrity Insurance, a small-sized company. Through this affiliation, Grange serves Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota.

The accusation, which saw Blacklane taken to court in Berlin, was that Blacklane had unfairly and, to a great part, incorrectly presented taxi prices with a number of \\"hidden\\" additional costs. These additional costs included such things as 10% for potential delays due to traffic as well as a requirement to pay a 10% tip. This led to Blacklane's own pre-tax prices, which are fixed, appearing cheaper than the pre-tax price of a taxi. This was seen as libel and Blacklane was given the chance to remove such comparisons or face either paying up to 250,000 euros in fines or having to cease operations for up to 6 months. = The Smart regulatory allowance 2014 = Blacklane caused a stir again in 2014 upon rolling out their Smart Class.

Founded in 1925, it is the only beachfront private club to survive from the early 20th century along New Hampshire's coast. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history The Beach Club consists of a cluster of four buildings built around a saltwater swimming pool on the beach near the junction of Ocean Boulevard (New Hampshire Route 1A) and Sea Road. The main clubhouse, facing roughly south, is a single-story frame structure with modest Victorian styling, to which a stone addition was made on the east side. The frame portion is five bays wide, with a shed-roof portico sheltering the center entrance. The stone addition is two bays wide, with a chimney prominently rising at the center of its facade. The interior has open timber-frame woodwork, with kitchen and service facilities in modern additions to the north. Surrounding the saltwater pool are three bathhouses, which house changing rooms and service equipment and storage for the pool. On the east side of the pool is a covered cabana- like area with views of the ocean. left The main clubhouse was built c. 1882, and has been repeatedly modified since then. It originally was run as a concession to all local visitors. The oldest of the bathhouses was built about 1900 by this business. It became a private club in 1925, catering to the elite of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, who felt their summer resort was becoming overrun by a less savory and more transient type of visitor. Prominent leaders of the club included Massachusetts Governor Alvan T. Fuller, who had a summer residence nearby. The swimming pool was originally built in 1927 by the club, and was replaced in 2007. It features an underwater lighting system that is a near replica of one the original pool had.

Dr. M. R. Rajagopal is the founder and chairman of Pallium India. Pallium India works in collaboration with several national and international organisations to improve the accessibility and affordability of pain relief drugs (opioids) and other low-cost medicines, to ensure the availability of palliative care services in India and to improve the quality of palliative care services provided by the healthcare and allied health care professionals. In February 2016, Pallium India was accredited by Social Justice Department of Government of Kerala.  Activities  Pallium India's vision is an India in which palliative care is integrated in all health care so that every person has access to effective pain relief and quality palliative care along with disease‚Äìspecific treatment and across the continuum of care. Pallium India's mission is to catalyze the development of effective pain relief and quality palliative care services and their integration in health care across India through delivery of services, education, building capacities, policy, research, advocacy and information. The activities spearheaded by Pallium India concentrate mostly on areas inadequately addressed by existing organizations. Pallium India works with Central and State Governments of India for integrating palliative care into the healthcare system, facilitating palliative care education and improving access to essential and affordable medicines like morphine and other opioids. In 2017, Pallium India opened a library dedicated to palliative care. Books were donated by Elisabeth K√ºbler- Ross Foundation and Dr Odette Spruyt of Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Pallium India collaborates with the following organizations in the field of palliative care: * International Association for Hospice & Palliative Care (IAHPC) * International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) * Asia Pacific Hospice Network (APHN) * American Cancer Society * Human Rights Watch * United States Cancer Pain Relief Committee * Lance Armstrong Foundation * Savitri Waney Trust * Wilfrid Bruce Davis Trust * Farida & Yusuf Hameed Foundation * Indo- American Cancer Association * Australasia Palliative Link International (APLI) * Cairdeas International * Indian Association of Palliative Care (IAPC) * Pain and Palliative Care Society, Calicut, Kerala, India * CanKids...KidsCan, New Delhi, India * Child Family Health International(CFHI) * Alpha Charitable Trust, Edamuttam Pallium India runs home visit programs in and around Trivandrum, as well as inpatient and outpatient clinics in collaboration with different hospitals in Trivandrum. Other services include bereavement support groups, Vocational Rehabilitation Program for patients and families and education of children whose parents are under treatment by Pallium India. Services to poor patients are provided free of cost. Expenses in this regard are met by donations. Trivandrum Institute of Palliative Sciences (TIPS) is an organ of Pallium India, established in 2006. In 2012, TIPS was declared a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre (WHOCC) for Training and Policy on Access to Pain Relief. Education and research are major activities of TIPS. TIPS provides medical care (inpatient, out-patient and home care services), counselling care, rehabilitation and other supportive services. Bruce Davis Training Centre (BDTC), the training division of Pallium India, runs a number of different awareness programs and trainings throughout the year with a focus on improving the general awareness among the public and improving the expertise and competency of healthcare and allied healthcare professionals. These include Certificate Course in Pain and Palliative Medicine (CCPPM) for doctors, in Palliative Nursing (CCPN) for nurses and in Palliative Care (CCPC) for allied healthcare professionals. There are also volunteer training programs conducted frequently. Pallium India works with several hospitals and organizations to catalyse the development of palliative care centres across India and for introducing palliative care education to professionals. Pallium India collaborates with the Department of Social Justice of Government of Kerala to improve the facilities for wheelchair-bound people in the state. This includes providing rehabilitation services and advocacy for their improved mobility, including creating pavements and buildings that are wheelchair-friendly. Pallium India regularly organizes awareness programs for the public, get-together for patients, art and craft exhibition, food festival and cultural events to spread the message of palliative care. Pallium India works with Paediatric and Paediatric Neurology departments of S.A.T Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram to provide palliative care for children suffering from various illnesses. Pallium India works out of its office at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. Currently, Pallium India is advocating for a rational national legislation for end of life care, which allows natural death with dignity and in incurable diseases with access to palliative care, rather than intensive care.  Achievements  Pallium India played a major role in the steps leading to the declaration of a National Program on Palliative care by the Government of India in 2012 November and the Amendment of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances(NDPS) Act of India in 2014. In 2008, Pallium India initiated and followed up a proposal that resulted in the declaration of a \\"Palliative Care Policy\\" by the Government of Kerala, making it the first Government in a developing country to have such a policy. In 2016, Pallium India was awarded the Cancer Aid Society Annual Award for Excellence and Leadership in Palliative Care for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Countries. In November 2017, Pallium India was awarded Sat Paul Mittal Award of appreciation, in Ludhiana. A group of palliative care experts under the leadership of Dr M R Rajagopal, collaborated to prepare the draft curriculum for M.D. Palliative Medicine, on behalf of Medical Council of India. A curriculum that introduces palliative care to undergraduate medical and nursing education has been submitted to the Medical Council of India. Pallium India has catalyzed the development of training centres offering quality education in palliative care in Trivandrum (TIPS), Hyderabad (MNJIO RCC), Jaipur (BMCHRC) and Ahmedabad (GCRI). With financial support from international agencies, ten palliative care service centres were established in different states of India - Jharkhand, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Bihar, Orissa, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep. In collaboration with Australasian Palliative Link International (APLI), Pallium India developed a mentoring program called Project Hamrahi for budding palliative care organizations in India Working with national and international experts, Pallium India created the National Standards tool (Minimum Standards for Palliative Care Programs) to ensure quality palliative care. An advocacy tool initiated by Pallium India with two international partners, called 'the Morphine Manifesto', caught the attention of the international palliative care community so much that 63 international organizations signed up to be launch partners.

He succeeded Tun Fuad Stephens on 1 January 1965 and was replaced on 12 May 1967 by Tun Mustapha Harun. Lo, an ethnic Chinese of Hakka descent, belonged to the party Sabah Chinese Association (SCA).Eintrag auf www.worldstatesmen.org; Retrieved on 12 June 2012Malaysia: Who‚Äôs Who Constitution Government & Politics, Edition 2011, Page 1129, Kusuya Management Sdn Bhd, Kuala Lumpur 2011,  Biography  Peter Lo Su Yin was born on 19 May 1923 in Sandakan, Sabah. He first attended St. Mary's school in Sandakan and after that St. Anthony's Boys School in Singapore. Having won a scholarship through the Colombo Plan in 1952 to study Law at the Victoria University of Wellington in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1955 he received his Bachelor of Law degree. In 1956 he was admitted to the Bar, thus becoming the first Sabahan to graduate in law and qualify as a lawyer. On returning to Sabah (or Crown Colony of North Borneo as it was known then), he worked for the Singapore law firm Donaldson & Burkinshaw in Sandakan between 1957-1961. At the same time in 1958 he took a position with the Sandakan Town Board and was soon promoted to the senior post of Deputy Chairman which he held until 1961. He left Donaldson & Burkinshaw in 1961 to set up his own law practice, Peter Lo & Co, the first Sabah law firm to be opened by a local Sabahan and which to this day still exists as a practising law firm. At the same time in 1961-62 he was appointed as a deputy in the Legislative Assembly of North Borneo and as such, also a member of the Sabah Public Services Commission. It was around this time that the concept of a new nation comprising Malaya, Singapore and the Bornean states of Sabah and Sarawak was being put forward. Later during the negotiation stage Lo was appointed by the British government as a member of the Inter-Governmental Committee to sit in 2 sub-committees: the Constitutional sub-committee and the Judicial and Legal Sub-committee, whose remit was to define the terms and conditions by which Sabah would combine with the other nations to form the new nation of Malaysia, and to ensure its rights and interests in this new entity would be safeguarded and protected. It was during these negotiations that the now famous and sometimes controversial document known as the \\"20-point agreement\\" was first drafted. Lo, representing Sabah's interests and with his background in law, was a key player in these talks and integral not just in coming up with the set of demands and conditions by which Sabah's rights would be protected following a merger with the other nations, but was responsible also for drafting this important piece of legislation. The new nation of Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963. At the same time Lo was busy preparing for a political career in the post independence era and so set about to form a political party with Khoo Siak Chiew called The United Party. This party later merged with the Democratic Party to become the Borneo Utara National Party (BUNAP) which subsequently changed its name to Sabah National Party (SANAP) when the Crown Colony of North Borneo was renamed Sabah in 1963. In 1965 SANAP merged with The Sabah Chinese Association (SCA) and the new party became the SCA. Lo was President of the SCA when he became Chief Minister.Sabah State Archive: Our Collection ; Retrieved on 12 June 2012 Lo served as a Member of Parliament for the new Malaysia from 1963 to 1978. In 1964 he was appointed Minister without portfolio to serve in the Federal Cabinet under the then Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the first Sabahan to hold this privilege. Then in late 1964, following a collapse in the Sabah coalition government due to tension between the 2 leading parties UPKO (United Pasok Momogon Kadazan Organisation) and USNO (United Sabah National Organisation), Lo was appointed Chief Minister of Sabah when the incumbent Chief Minister, Donald Stephens resigned. Lo took up this position on 1 January 1965, becoming only the second Chief Minister of Sabah, and the first Chinese to hold this post. He was in charge during arguably one of the most difficult and turbulent times in Malaysia's history, having to ensure harmony in a new multi-racial nation, whilst also juggling often conflicting demands between the Federal, British and Sabah governments. It was also during Lo‚Äôs tenure, only months into his position as Chief Minister, that saw the withdrawal of Singapore from Malaysia to become an independent nation in 1965, a landmark event in both Malaysia and Singapore‚Äôs history. Lo lost his seat in the State elections in 1967 and was replaced as Chief Minister by Mustapha Harun. He continued to serve as a Member of Parliament until 1978 after which he returned to focus on his legal career. Lo died on 1 January 2020 in KPJ Sabah Specialist Hospital, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia at the age of 96. He was married to Rosie Dorothy Funk (deceased 2002) and left behind 4 children- Jenny, Cynthia, Bonaventure, Jacqueline - and son-in-law, Michael. His eldest daughter became BBC editor cum producer in London, the second daughter became a senior officer with a bank in Sabah, the youngest daughter became a chartered accountant in London while his son became a lawyer in Singapore.  Awards and honours  Lo was awarded the Panglima Setia Mahkota (PSM) which carries the title 'Tan Sri' by the King in 1996. Before that, in 1972 he was awarded the Panglima Gemilang Darjah Kinabalu (PGDK), a state honour carrying the title 'Datuk'. On 12 May 2007, Lo was awarded the Unity Award from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. = Honour of Malaysia = * : ** 50px Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (PSM) - Tan Sri (1996)  References  Category:1923 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Malaysian people of Hakka descent Category:Malaysian Roman Catholics Category:Chief Ministers of Sabah Category:Sabah state ministers Category:Members of the Dewan Rakyat Category:Members of the Sabah State Legislative Assembly Category:Sabah Chinese Association politicians Category:Victoria University of Wellington alumni Category:Commanders of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia Category:20th-century Malaysian politicians ","title":"Peter Lo Su Yin"},{"id":"43025937","title":"Thug Notes"},{"id":"43025949","text":"Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA) is one of the research institutes under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi to serve as the nodal agency for catering to the needs of the brackishwater aquaculture research in India.Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA)  Chennai  BioTecNika The institute is headquartered at Santhome High Road, Raja Annamalai Puram, Chennai with a research centre at Kakdwip in West Bengal and an experimental field station at Muttukadu, roughly 30 km to the south of Chennai.

The episode aired on June 3, 2014 in the United States on FX. It was written by series creator and showrunner Noah Hawley and directed by Scott Winant. The title refers to the paradox in logic known as the paradox of the heap. In the episode, Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman), having successfully framed his brother Chazz for the murders, finds newborn strength and decides to start his life anew. It also features a one-year ellipsis, during which the lives of all main characters have radically changed. The episode was acclaimed by critics, and was seen by 1.86 million viewers. Plot Following his brother Chazz Nygaard's arrest, Lester Nygaard consoles his sister-in-law, Kitty, who believes her husband is guilty. Shortly afterward, Lester tosses out Pearl's belongings, beginning a new life. Later, Gina Hess angrily storms into Lester's office, demanding payment from Sam's insurance policy and accusing Lester of having duped her and taken advantage of her sexually. Lester initially pretends he will make some calls on her behalf, but when her sons try to bully Lester, he hits them with a stapler, which in turn intimidates all three of the surviving Hess family members, and they back off. Additionally, Lester tells Mrs. Hess that Sam's having stopped paying the premium on the policy indicates she won't get paid. Lester's dominant performance impresses his coworker Linda. Meanwhile, Molly Solverson returns to work and unsuccessfully attempts to reopen the Lester Nygaard investigation. At the Duluth hospital, Lorne Malvo kills a police guard and gives Mr. Wrench the handcuff key to escape, telling him that he and Mr. Numbers came closer than anyone else ever had to besting Malvo. Malvo confesses that he killed Mr. Numbers and tells Wrench to come find him if he still wants revenge. In Fargo, FBI Agents Pepper and Budge, having been assigned to surveillance during Malvo's 22-homicide gun rampage and missed his having walked right by their car en route to entering the building, are demoted to file clerks.

Upon returning to live near hometown Wollongong in 2005, Cunningham began performing live as 'Leadfinger', relying on open tuning and slide guitar driven songs. The first three Leadfinger albums were released through Bang! Records, a Spanish Basque independent label that specialises in underground Australian rock like The Beasts of Bourbon, The Scientists and The Drones. The band's most recent album No Room at the Inn, came out through iconic Australian Label Citadel Records whose legacy stretches back 30 years and roster includes many of Leadfinger's own musical influences including Deniz Tek, Died Pretty and the Lime Spiders. The name 'leadfinger' was originally a nom de plume for Stewart Cunningham and originates from when his brother shot him with an air rifle at age 14. The lead pellet from the air rifle became embedded in his left index finger and required surgery to remove. Future bandmates would take to calling Cunningham 'leadfinger' in jest that the bizarre air rifle injury had somehow come to influence his guitar style. Cunningham himself states that the name Leadfinger was also chosen for his new project as an homage to delta blues legend Lead Belly, his original intention being to perform solo under the name. Cunningham continues a great tradition of Scottish Australian rock musicians and songwriters in Australia following in the steps of the Young family (members of AC/DC, The Easybeats), Jimmy Barnes, Bon Scott, Colin Hay, Karl Broadie, James McCann and others.  Music  Leadfinger dabble in a wide variety of styles but are mostly known for a combination of guitar driven high energy rock, power pop and 70s punk rock, similar to The Replacements, Radio Birdman and The Saints. Leadfinger mine the deep seam of underground guitar music back through the 70s rock and punk era's to the classic Stones and Dylan records of the late 60s and beyond. Their tools are as broad as their musical palette; electric guitars, 12 and 6 string acoustic guitars, alternate tunings and slide, dynamic bass and drums and harmony vocals. Their music embodies a soulful and classic kind of rock and roll and is based around the songwriting of singer/guitarist Stewart Cunningham and the use of vintage gear and amplification.  History  = 2005‚Äì2008 (The Floating Life) = After a 4-year hiatus from playing and writing music following the death of his Yes-Men bandmate, Sean Greenway in 2001 and the abrupt end of that band, Cunningham began writing again in 2005 and a new batch of songs was recorded primarily as demos in his home studio. These songs would eventually be compiled for release as the first Leadfinger album, 'the floating life' which came out in mid 2007 through Spanish based record label Bang! Records. The connection with Bang! Records came through that label's prior release of recordings by Cunningham's earlier bands Brother Brick, The Yes-Men and Asteroid B-612. The first ever Leadfinger gig took place at Wollongong's long standing underground venue The Oxford Tavern in February 2006 and featured in Cunningham's own words \\"‚Ä¶a musician used to playing with a band fumbling through a set of songs in a shocked and disjointed manner\\". By mid 2006 Cunningham was joined at a number of gigs by drummer Stephen O'Brien (ex- The Unheard). Finally at the Oxford Tavern on NYE 2006 the first full line-up of Leadfinger was completed with the addition of Wayne Stokes (ex-Thumlock) on electric bass guitar. This initial 3 piece line- up of Leadfinger would only play live sporadically in its time together, including the official launch gig for 'the floating life' album at the Hopetoun Hotel in Sydney on 29 July 2007. They managed to record a batch of new songs in two inspired sessions at an old farmhouse in the Tongarra dairy country below Macquarie Pass south of Wollongong. These recordings can be heard on the Through the Cracks CD EP (2008 ‚Äì Musicfarmers Records) and the Rich Kids album (2009 ‚Äì Bang! Records). Both these releases were produced and mixed by Cunningham at his home studio, dubbed 'Leadfinger's Rendezvous Studio'. This first line up played its last gig at The Tote Hotel in Melbourne as part of the two night Bang! Records Festival on 15 August 2008. = 2008 ‚Äì 2009 (Rich Kids) = The current and most well known Leadfinger line up came together in late 2008 with the addition of second guitarist Michael Boyle (ex- Mudlungs) and a new rhythm section of Adam 'Reggie' Screen on electric bass guitar and Dillon Hicks (ex-Zambian Goat Herders). on Drums. Although they played their first official gig at The Annandale Hotel in Sydney in January 2009, Hicks had previously filled in on Drums for some Leadfinger gigs in Melbourne in 2008 whilst Boyle had been playing with Cunningham in a duet format at smaller intimate gigs in the previous two years. With the culmination of this line up the band became a genuine going concern. A newfound camaraderie and commitment that was missing from the previous line up enabled the band to play live more regularly and pursue a more definite musical direction. 2009 finally saw a belated release of the Tongarra farmhouse recordings by the first Leadfinger line up. The album titled Rich Kids (after the album track Rich Kids Can't Play Rock'n‚Äôroll) was released on vinyl and cd again through Bang! Records. Critical reviews of the album were very positive. Of the album's title track Patrick Emery wrote via Australian Mess+Noise music website \\"‚Ä¶Rich Kids Can't Play Rock'n‚ÄôRoll but Leadfinger can!\\" Rich Kids has a raw, distinctly Australian sound a la The Saints and Radio Birdman and contained two standout tracks that would become mainstays of the live set for years to come, namely Fade Your Brilliance and Rich Kids Can't Play Rock'n‚ÄôRoll. Both formats of the album also include a cover of Bad Penny, a song written originally performed and written by Rory Gallagher whilst a version of I Think of Demons (originally by Roky Erickson) appears on the vinyl format. A version of The Saints song Ghost Ships appears on the CD release. = 2010 ‚Äì 2011 (We Make the Music) = Over winter 2010 Leadfinger recorded album number 3 at Sydney's Big Jesus Burger Studio in Surry Hills, Sydney. With the help of JP Fung and Brent Williams (The New Christs) the band found themselves in a professional recording studio for the first time and made the most of it. We Make the Music was recorded using vintage analogue technology and 2\\" tape and then mixed on a vintage Neve desk. As a result, the sound of this album has great warmth and depth that harks back to great seventies era albums that are a strong influence on the band like Exile on Main Street by the Rolling Stones and Big Star's first two albums. We Make the Music was released in March 2011. The CD and digital version were released through Wollongong based record label Impedance Records whilst the vinyl version came out through Bang! Records. The album title and title track was inspired by a particular scene from the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (starring Gene Wilder) and is a statement on the originality and the value of artistic inspiration over corporate and media manipulation. \\"We are the music makers and we are the dreamers of the dreams\\" was originally from an 1873 poem, Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy. There was enough material recorded at the BJB sessions to make a double album and this was Cunningham's original intention but lack of enthusiasm for this idea from both labels meant that We Make the Music was the standard 12 tracks although the track list for each format is markedly different. The album Launch was at the Annandale Hotel on 19 May 2011 and it received many good reviews with Australian webzine the i-94 Bar declaring \\"This is a bona-fide Australian Classic\\". The Remaining tracks from the sessions were released on a limited edition CD EP called I Belong to the Band in November 2011. Leadfinger also made two video clips for songs from the We Make the Music album, for the title track We Make the Music and the song Fourteen from the CD version of the album. Both clips were produced by Rob Stephenson. = 2012 ‚Äì 2015 (No Room at the Inn) = In late 2011 Leadfinger began arranging and rehearsing a new batch of songs that would become album No. 4. The songs were mostly pre-written by Cunningham with many being inspired by an Epiphone acoustic 12 string guitar that had he had acquired in early 2011. Songs like The Wandering Man, Gimme the Future, Pretty Thing and The Other Ones that became the backbone of the album were all based on simple 3 chord progressions that were given a distinct tone and twist by the involvement of the 12 string sound. Having a very small budget the band had no option but to record something quick and inexpensively so the bed tracks were done at Sydney's Defwolf studio in late April 2012 whilst the overdubs, vocals and mixing were completed by Cunningham himself at his home studio, Leadfinger's Rendezvous Studio over the next few months. The resulting album No Room at the Inn was recorded and mastered for under $5,000. It is a true independent recording paid for and made by the band. The album was fortuitously picked up by iconic Australian record label Citadel Records and it received worthy critical acclaim upon release in February 2013. Most great rock 'n‚Äô roll is made out on the fringes but this latest album from Australian veteran Stewart 'Leadfinger' Cunningham packs such a punch that it deserves to come out from the underground. Fans of bands from The Masters' Apprentices to HITS will love its greasy swagger, sure-footed songwriting and a sound that's both rich and raw. This is a deep seam, back to the classic Stones records of the late '60s on songs like You're So Strange, with its gospel-charged backing vocal from Chloe West. Gimme The Future sports searing guitar work that threatens to shred speakers, and Cruel City pumps with the kind of intensity once found on Radio Birdman records. But there is also room for banjo on the dusty roads of the title tune, and the intense The Lonely Road is dedicated to Rory Gallagher. Anyone who ever heard the sparks flying on a record by the late Irish bluesman will recognise a soul brother in Leadfinger and his passionate tunes.\\" (4 Stars) Noel Mengel, The Courier Mail, 20 April 2013'' To promote the album Leadfinger embarked on an Australian tour in March and April 2013 supporting fellow Citadel label mate and legendary Detroit-born musician Deniz Tek (ex- Radio Birdman/New Race). = 2016 ‚Äì present (Friday Night Heroes) = The band released their newest album Friday Night Heroes on 14 July 2016. Recorded in mid-2015 when Leadfinger spent a few weeks in Linear Recording Studio (Leichardt, NSW), it was released through the Brisbane-based Conquest of Noise label. The band embarked on a ten date, 4 state Australian tour in July and August to promote the album. In October 2017 Leadfinger played its first ever overseas gigs when the band played a 14 date European tour that included gigs in France, Switzerland and Spain.

Built about 1761, it is a well-preserved example of late colonial architecture with an early Federal period door surround. The building was moved to its present location as part of a project to widen nearby Deer Street. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Samuel Beck House stands near the southwestern corner of The Hill, a cluster of historic houses southwest of the junction of Deer and High Streets. These houses were relocated to this area as part of a road widening project. The Beck House is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. It is five bays wide and two deep, with a large central chimney, and an early Federal-period front door surround with an arched fanlight. The interior retains original 18th-century features, including paneled fireplace surrounds, and a three-run winding staircase in the front entry vestibule. The land where this house originally stood on Deer Street was platted in 1710 and subdivided in 1756. It was purchased by Samuel Beck in 1761. The neighborhood, populated in the early 20th century by Italian immigrants, was subjected to urban renewal activities in the 1960s and 1970s. This house was one of a number that was relocated to form The Hill, while others were razed or moved elsewhere.

Its occurrence in Peru, in the city of Callao, needs to be confirmed.  Description  A. obliquus has a high shell, reaching in length. The apex is prominent but not sharp, dorsally flattened, curved to the back and slightly to the right, with the tip usually facing down. The protoconch shows a deep apical depression, from which clear radial lines depart, and rounded, irregularly arranged punctuations.

It was listed by Cadw (Reference Number 918).British Listed Buildings; accessed 5 June 2014 The property was acquired in 1595 by Sir Hugh Myddleton who provided London with its first fresh water supply and remodelled in the mid 17th century by Sir Richard Clough, in a similar fashion to his Bachegraig hall. The multi-dormered tiled roof building, also known as \\"The Eyes of Ruthin\\" due to the seven dormer windows, originally framed with timber but replaced with brick in the late 18th century. The Dutch design, long, steeped roof is attributed to Sir Richard Clough, an Elizabethan merchant. It has four tiers of dormer windows, each at a different elevation, known locally as the seven eyes of Ruthin. The interior features of the building include three tiers of dormer windows set within the tiled roof and the spere truss (or aisle-truss) which is clearly visible upstairs. The exact dating of the house is unknown, what is certain is that the core of the house was a medieval hall-house type, now difficult to recognise due to the many alterations that have taken place. In one of the rooms is a mural bearing, in moulding, the date 1657 and the Langford coat-of-arms. The Langfords were brought to Ruthin by the de Greys in the 15th century and served as constables of Ruthin Castle. The property is said to have been purchased by Sir Hugh Myddleton in 1595. Sir Hugh virtually bankrupted himself in providing London with its first fresh water.

The estate is part of a recently implemented design in the nearby Blyth Valley by the landscape architect Lancelot 'Capability' Brown (1716‚Äì1783). History Wilderness surrounds Heveningham Hall, a former National Trust house, now in use as a private residence. In 1782, a Capability Brown design for Heveningham's grounds was commissioned by Sir Gerard Vanneck, 2nd Baron of Huntingfield and then owner of Heveningham, but, following Brown's death in 1783, the plans were only partly implemented. In 1994, Heveningham was purchased by British entrepreneur Jon Hunt, who set about restoring Brown's original design, using his original plans. Hunt sought the help of landscape architect Kim Wilkie. At first Wilkie refused: he told the Financial Times, \\"When I realised that Jon was a property developer I didn't want to go anywhere near it\\". Wilkie was persuaded to join the project after visiting Heveningham with Hunt, studying the original Brown plans and taking inspiration from the landform. Work began in 1995, and parts of the estate were opened for private hire in 2013. Development work To develop the estate, Hunt has purchased a total of 5000 acres of adjacent land, pieced together in numerous property transactions. Restoring Brown's vision required Wilkie and Hunt to remove modern features inconsistent with an 18th-century design. Numerous concrete roads, car parks, telegraph poles and farm outbuildings were either demolished or buried. Referring to this programme of re-wilding the estate, Hunt told Country Life magazine that he \\"...didn't like the human bits.\\" A large area of arable farmland was left to return to the wild. Country Life magazine reported, \\"‚Ä¶sharp-leaved fluellen, field madder, heartsease, corn mint ‚Äì these and other plants that an arable farmer would regard as weeds flourish unsprayed\\". Returning this farmland to the wild over two decades has allowed significant numbers of animal species, flora and fauna to settle in the area. Wilkie says that \\"98 per cent\\" of Brown's original 600-acre design at Heveningham is now in place, and that the wider area has been developed according to principles that Brown would recognise as consistent with an Arcadian pleasure ground, including lakes, parkland and woods and various historic manor houses. In developing the estate, Hunt has said he has been inspired by the work of entrepreneur conservationists Doug and Susie Tompkins, and by his childhood spent roaming moors in Otterburn. Wildlife After the planting of 800,000 trees and the installation of 2,000 nest boxes, significant animal populations have flourished in the area. Breeding populations of raptors, barn owls, buzzards and other at-risk species have settled, as have mammal, amphibian, moth and butterfly populations, the latter being supported by the development of pines, lakes and meadows. Country Life reports that the estate supports 13 pairs of breeding owls and is visited by bitterns. In 2013, Hunt announced that 72,000 ash trees under the threat of European chalara disease would need to be removed from the estate, to be replaced by hornbeam and oak. Hunt describes the choice of ash as \\"‚Ä¶an ¬£850,000 mistake\\". Buildings The estate retains a notable collection of period buildings, principally Sibton Park, an 1827 Georgian Grade II listed manor house. Sibton's Greek ionic columns have been compared to William and Henry Inwood's All Saints' Church in Camden Town, London. The real architect is unknown, although Country Life magazine speculates that the architect is possibly Decimus Burton, known for buildings at London Zoo and Kew Gardens. Other restored buildings include The Clockhouse, Hex Cottage and various farmhouses, lodges and barns. Hunt's private residence is adjacent to the estate, but some buildings within the estate have been made available for holiday accommodation, including a clockhouse, barn and a gate lodge, as well as a farmhouse said to have been visited by Alexa Chung. In 2013, Hunt told the Financial Times: \\"Farming alone won't pay for a modern estate to survive. Real estate will.\\" In 2016 the New York Times covered the opening of The Walled Garden, an eight-bedroom resort building on the estate based around an 18th-century walled kitchen garden.

Snell (10 September 1897 ‚Äì 27 March 1967) was a pianist, conductor, composer and music director. He composed the music for over 170 shorts, series or feature films. Early years David L. Snell was born on 10 September 1897 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He became a pianist, and studied at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music, Wisconsin College and the Meyer Conservatory of Music. He formed his own orchestra, and was the musical director for several stage productions. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer music director Snell joined Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer's music department in 1937, turning out music for a range of films from low-cost \\"B\\" movies to expensive features. He would spend his entire film career with MGM. He was conductor, composer, and music director for MGM for twenty-one years.' The work could be high pressure. In November 1938 Franz Waxman had just five days to put together the fifty-minute score for A Christmas Carol so it could be released in time for the holiday season. Snell helped out, writing the opening and closing credit cues and half a dozen other cues based on themes provided by Waxman. Snell wrote music for many full-length films, shorts and B-movie series such as Dr. Kildare, Maisie and The Thin Man. His songs include Under The Stars, Downstream Drifter, Come Back Little Girl Of Mine and Once Over Lightly. Snell's scores often showed first- rate craftmanship, but his work has generally been ignored, perhaps because in most cases he chose to simply underscore the dialog as opposed to contributing complementary musical ideas. However, for the 1947 Lady in the Lake, based on the Raymond Chandler novel and set around Christmas time, Snell chose to use a choir singing a cappella without musical accompaniment, providing an austere and effective \\"black and white\\" score to accompany the stark black and white cinematography. The moody music echoed Christmas carols. David L. Snell died at home in Glendale, California on March 27, 1967.

As a discipline, choreomusicology emerged at the end of the twentieth century as a field of study concerned with the relationship between music and dance. More precisely, choreomusicology grew out of Euro-American performance traditions that considered musical composition and dance choreography as separate specialties. Not all performance genres separate music and dance into separate theoretical categories. The directionality of the relationship between sound and movement is not always fixed. Choreomusicologists hold that studying the variable relationships between sound and movement in diverse performance arts can provide insight into perceptual sensibilities, cultural processes, and interpersonal dynamics. Famous artists whose works exhibit rich choreomusical relationships include: John Cage and Merce Cunningham, Igor Stravinsky and George Balanchine, and Louis Horst and Martha Graham. Interesting choreomusical relationships also exist in West Sumatran Tari Piring, West Javanese Pencak Silat, and Afro- Brazilian Capoeira to name but a few examples.http://jonathanstill.com/2012/03/02/new-choreomusicology-article/ The following institutions have developed programs practicing and/or researching choreomusicology: accompagnement choregraphique CNSMDP (Paris), continuing studies at Institut del Teatre (Barcelona), MAD at DNSPA (Copenhagen).

It was formerly known as Laketown. In the 2016 census, Buckley had a population of 211 people. Laketown A hotel called the Lady of the Lake Hotel opened on Barrabool Road at what is now Buckley in 1854, and the area began to be known as Laketown. The hotel reportedly flourished, being located on the road to Colac, and became a social centre for the area. The hotel was a coach stop on the road to Colac, and the Duke of Edinburgh reportedly stopped there in 1870 while his party's horses were being rested. A post office opened at Laketown on 15 March 1872, and a store as added around the same period. A school was opened in 1878 close to the hotel, initially known as Mount Moriac State School (No. 2063), but renamed Laketown in 1883. A Laketown Football Club and Laketown Cricket Club existed in the 1870s, and had a sports ground west of the hotel. Laketown declined thereafter; the school closed in 1893, and was later used as a church and private residence. Laketown Post Office closed temporarily from 1 July to 1 October 1895, and then closed permanently on 1 October 1897. The Lady of the Lake Hotel's license lapsed in 1912, when it became a private home, and it burned down in 1962. The former school is the only surviving remnant of the former Laketown settlement, and is listed on the Surf Coast Shire heritage inventory as having state significance. Buckley The first school in what is now Buckley, which had predated that at the Laketown settlement, had opened in 1867 as Lake Modewarre School No. 926, a Catholic school. This school was located at the corner of Buckley School Road and Buckley School South. Wynd reports that it closed in 1874, but that some sources suggest it continued to 1883 and that its students were sent to the Laketown school. A second school, initially also named Lake Modewarre, opened in 1874 as School No. 1481; it changed its name to Buckley's Road State School in 1890, and again to Buckley State School in 1936. Buckley Primary School was closed and merged into Moriac Primary School, on the Moriac school site, in 1993. The locality once had a railway station on the Port Fairy railway line. It was successively named Laketown, Modewarre, and then Buckley railway station, as the name of the area changed over the years, but has now closed. The station also had its own post office, separate to that at the Laketown settlement. That post office was opened as Lake Town Railway Station Post Office on 1 May 1884, renamed Modewarre Railway Station PO on 10 March 1885, Buckley's Road PO on 15 August 1890, Buckley Railway Station PO in 1910, and Buckley PO on 18 October 1848. It closed on 30 June 1970. Buckley today remains a small rural locality. The Buckley Tennis and Social Club is among the last community institutions remaining in the town.

In July 2019, after Butler completed an initial five-year term at the church, it was announced that the church's governing body would not be extending Butler's term for an additional five years. The official announcement described the decision as mutual. Later reports, however, cited retaliation against Butler for a harassment claim she had filed against a Church Council member who was accused of sexually harassing her and other female staff members, a visit to an education-based, sex toy store by Butler, two church employees, and a congregant during an out- of-town conference trip, and her request during the contract renewal negotiations to be compensated the same as her male predecessor as well as have protections put in place to guard staff against church leaders who engaged in practices of harassment and bullying as potentially contributing factors in the governing body's decision. A former church council member also revealed that although the Church Council had conducted a full and comprehensive investigation into the lay leader accused of sexually harassing female staff members, the governing body voted to terminate their relationship with Butler after an investigation that seemed rushed and poorly documented by comparison into complaints leveled against her by unnamed staff members.

While these principles are independent, they are also interrelated. The principles of logistics are the same as the principles of sustainment. # Integration is combining all of the elements of sustainment (tasks, functions, systems, processes, organizations) to operations assuring unity of command and effort. Army forces integrate sustainment with joint forces and multinational operations to maximize the complementary and reinforcing effects from each Service and national resources. # Anticipation is the ability to foresee operational requirements and initiate actions that satisfy a response without waiting for an operations order or fragmentary order. Sustainment commanders and staffs visualize future operations, # Identify required support and start the process of acquiring the sustainment that best supports the operation. # Responsiveness is the ability to react to changing requirements and respond to meet the needs to maintain support. Through responsive sustainment, commanders maintain operational focus and pressure, set the tempo of friendly operations to prevent exhaustion, replace ineffective units, and extend operational reach. # Simplicity relates to processes and procedures to minimize the complexity of sustainment. Clarity of tasks, standardized and interoperable procedures, and clearly defined command relationships contribute to simplicity. # Economy is providing sustainment resources in an efficient manner to enable a commander to employ all assets to achieve the greatest effect possible. It is achieved through efficient management and discipline, prioritizing and allocating resources, and capitalizing on joint interdependencies. It can also be achieved by contracting for support or using host nation resources to reduce or eliminate the use of military resources. # Survivability is all aspects of protecting personnel, weapons, and supplies while simultaneously deceiving the enemy (JP 3-34). Survivability consists of a quality or capability of military forces which permits then to avoid or withstand hostile actions or environmental conditions while retaining the ability to fulfill their primary mission. In mitigating risks and minimizing disruptions to sustainment, commanders often must rely on the use of redundant sustainment capabilities and alternative support plans. # Continuity is the uninterrupted provision of sustainment across all levels of war. It is achieved through a system of integrated and focused networks linking sustainment across the levels of war, other Service support capabilities, and to operations. It assures confidence in sustainment allowing commanders‚Äô freedom of action, operational reach and prolonged endurance. # Improvisation is the ability to adapt sustainment operations to unexpected situations or circumstances affecting a mission. It includes creating, inventing, arranging, or fabricating what is needed from what is available. The sustainment commander must apply operational art to visualize complex operations and understand what is possible at the tactical level. These skills enable commanders to improvise operational and tactical actions when enemy actions unexpected events disrupt sustainment operations.

In Germany, Friedenstein was one of the largest palaces of its time and one of the first Baroque palaces ever built. Friedenstein served as the main seat of the Dukes of Saxe-Gotha and later as one of the residences of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, closely linked with the Royal Family of Great Britain through the marriage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The final two ruling Dukes were both princes of the United Kingdom. The palace complex today houses several museums. It is also notable for hosting the , one of the oldest theatres in operation in Germany, still featuring the original Baroque machinery for changing the scenery. History =Earlier structures= The site where Friedenstein stands today, dominating the town of Gotha and its surroundings, was previously occupied by Grimmenstein Castle. It was first mentioned in 1316 and rebuilt in 1531-43 when it was also fortified in accordance with the changed requirements for a fortress in the age of gunpowder. In 1547, the Ernestine branch of the House of Wettin as members of the Protestant Schmalkaldic League had lost the Battle of M√ºhlberg against the Catholic forces of Emperor Charles V. As a result, Johann Friedrich I, Kurf√ºrst von Sachsen (John Frederick I) was stripped of his title as \\"Elector of Saxony\\" (Kurw√ºrde). Imperial forces blew up the fortifications of Grimmenstein but left the castle itself largely intact. It was rebuilt in 1552-54. However, in 1567 the fortress was almost completely razed as a result of the attempt of Johann Friedrich II (John Frederick II) to regain the Kurw√ºrde by force of arms. =Construction= In 1640, Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha, also known as Ernst der Fromme (\\"Ernest the Pious\\"), first ruler of the newly created Duchy of Saxe-Gotha, settled on Gotha as the site for his Residenz. Gotha at the time was the largest town in the Duchy. In 1641/42 work began on the park, followed by construction of the palace itself in 1643. In naming the castle Friedenstein (literally \\"peace-rock\\"), Ernst made a point of drawing a clear line between this new palace and the warlike history of its predecessor. In addition, with the Thirty Years War still ongoing, the name also expressed a desire for peace after decades of warfare. Based on plans by (1600-1663), (1601-1679) was in charge of building the castle. When it was finished in 1656, Friedenstein was the first ever Residenz in the Baroque style built on German soil that was completed during the lifetime of the ruler who ordered it. To justify the expense of such a vast structure, Ernest explicitly referred to the need to accommodate the administration for the new Duchy. In July 1655, work began on fortifying the castle. By 1672, four bastions had been completed. The outer works were finished by 1687 and, beginning in 1663, the town of Gotha was also fortified. In 1672, the House of Saxe-Altenburg ended and most of the Duchy passed to Ernst, who now was ruler of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Although the Duchy now had two Residenzen, Gotha was by far the more important one. However, Ernst was unwilling to exclude any of his surviving sons from his heritage. So after his death in 1675, the Duchy was split in 1680/81 into seven separate territories: Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-R√∂mhild, Saxe- Eisenberg, Saxe-Hildburghausen and Saxe-Saalfeld. Ernst's oldest son, Friedrich I, became Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, with his main Residenz at Gotha. =House of Saxe-Coburg= In 1826, after the death of the heirless Friedrich IV, the Duchy was split and Gotha passed to Ernst I of the House of Saxe-Coburg and father of Albert, Prince Consort who was to marry Queen Victoria. Ernst I now styled himself \\"Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\\", although he technically held the two separate Duchies of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in personal union. For the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the latter was only a secondary residence, the focus was squarely on Coburg, where the Ehrenburg Palace was the main residence. Ernst II, successor of Ernst I and older brother of Albert, did not live in the castle when in Gotha, but at the Winterpalais in the town. During his long reign (died in 1893), the castle only housed the administration of the Duchy. Since Ernst II was without heir, he made his nephew, Alfred, the second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, his heir. Alfred renounced his title of Duke of Edinburgh and his seat in the House of Lords and went to Germany. In 1899, his only son Alfred reportedly shot himself during his parents' 25th wedding anniversary celebrations at Friedenstein. After being cared for in the castle for some days he was sent to a sanatorium near Meran, where he died on 6 February 1899. As Alfred's uncle, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and cousin, Prince Arthur of Connaught, both renounced their right of succession to the Duchy, the title passed to Charles Edward (Karl Eduard), the son of the Duke of Albany, fourth son of Victoria and Albert. Since Charles Edward was only 16 at the time, until his 21st birthday on 19 July 1905 a regency was installed. World War I caused a conflict of loyalties for Charles Edward/Karl Eduard, but he sided with Germany, leading the British government to strip him of his titles in the United Kingdom. In November 1918, during the German Revolution Charles Edward was deposed by the local \\"Workers' and Soldiers' Council\\" and on 23 November he signed his abdication, thus ending the existence of the Duchy. The castle was now used as a museum. =After 1918= During World War II an air raid shelter was constructed in the casemates of the castle. In 1944, part of the park and outbuildings were heavily damaged by Allied bombing. After the end of the war, a significant part of the art treasures of the Friedenstein museums was transported to the Soviet Union as war reparations. However, most of it was restored in the late 1950s. During the time of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), renovation work in the castle began in 1965 and many of the additions of the late 19th and early 20th century were removed from the interior. In what became known as the ', in the night from 13 to 14 December 1979, five valuable paintings were stolen from the castle: Frans Hals (Brustbild eines jungen Mannes), Anthonis van Dyck (Selbstbildnis mit Sonnenblume), Jan Lievens (Alter Mann), Jan Brueghel the Elder (Landstra√üe mit Bauernwagen und K√ºhen) und Hans Holbein the Elder (Heilige Katharina). A special commission of the GDR police failed to solve the theft. Karsten Jauch: Bruch mit Weststahl (German).

In: Th√ºringische Landeszeitung, 14 November 2009. It took no less than 40 years for the paintings to be recovered. The theft is still unsolved, however, in the sense that the identity of the 1979 thieves remains unknown. In 2004, the castle and parks came into the care of the Stiftung Th√ºringer Schl√∂sser und G√§rten. Building history and architecture =Building history= View of the main wing with the Pagenhaus from the north View from the south, with the west and east pavilion and the main wing visible in between \\"Kiss of peace\\" above the main gate:Friede ernehret, Unfriede verzehret Palace chapel Audience hall Hauptsaal (Great Hall, 1683/86) The castle built for Ernst I was constructed according to general principles favoured by Protestant rulers in the 17th century. It took the form of a so-called \\"sub-ordinated\\" palace, meaning that the four wings are not on an equal footing but that there is one dominating main wing. At Friedenstein that is the four-story north wing, facing the town. The two side wings have three floors (but end in the four- story towers or pavilions) and the final wing had just one floor. Initially, all the state apartments were housed in the four-storied sections of the palace. The palace dominates the town by its sheer size: the main wing is 100 metres long, the two side wings are 140 metres long. Although the interior of the palace has been significantly altered since the time of Ernst I, the exterior has remained largely unchanged. The simple, unadorned exterior was originally selected to contrast with the palaces of Catholic princes, which at the time were still mostly influenced by the elaborate Renaissance style. The only major embellishment at Friedenstein were four larger-than-life statues located at the four corners of the palace, showing Moses, Elijah, John the Baptist and Martin Luther. Other external features were a few reliefs salvaged from the old Grimmenstein and some decoration above the main gate to the courtyard, located in the centre of the north wing. The austere facades are structured not by ornamental features but only by the symmetrical arrangement of the windows and a cornice running around the whole building between the first and second floors. On the side facing the courtyard, an arcade was constructed running around all four wings of the palace. The major later change to the external appearance of the palace has been the addition of the two buildings on the left and right of the main wing facing the town, known as Pagenhaus and Wachthaus, added in 1778/79. At that time the four statues were also removed. None of the original state rooms constructed for Ernst I remain today. The palace sections that have maintained their original use include the chapel and the Geheimes Archiv on the ground floor of the north wing. Otherwise the ground floor of all the wings housed servants' and storage rooms as well as an armoury, a stable, a mint and a smithy. The fourth wing contained a riding hall. The first upper floor of all the wings is slightly lower than the others ‚Äì it used to house the offices of the Ducal administration. The second floor contained the main representatives areas reached by two staircases located at the juncture between the north and the side wings. The palace interior was completely rearranged as early as the reign of Friedrich I, Ernst's son. In 1677, the east pavilion was struck by lightning and burned down. Fire walls helped to contain the fire to that part of the palace. It was realized that the Great Hall in the north wing, stretching over two floors and reaching above the chapel, prevented the addition of fire walls to the main wing. The hall was thus demolished and replaced by a new fire wall along with new state apartments: a flight of five rooms each for Duke and Duchess. These rooms were finished by around 1685. After that a new main hall, the Tafelgemach or Hauptsaal was added. After 1687, a crypt for the burial of the Ducal family was created beneath the chapel and the chapel itself rebuilt. In 1681/82, the former ballroom in the west pavilion was replaced by a theatre (see below). In 1684-87, the east pavilion was rebuilt and crowned with a rounded roof, distinguishing it from the west pavilion which retains its original roof shape. Friedrich III had the rooms of the Duchess renovated in 1747/51 and some years later, rooms for Friedrich III were added to the east pavilion. Friedrich's son Ernst II moved out of the Baroque state apartments in the main wing and into new rooms in the east wing, between the Mirror Hall and the east pavilion. Ernst II also had various other changes made to the palace and its surroundings, including tearing down some of the original gate buildings and ramparts and replacing the riding hall to the south with the simple wall now closing off the arcades of the south wing. Starting in 1797, the former guest quarters in the west wing were redesigned and new ones added. Rooms were planned for heir apparent Emil August and his bride. Since work was not finished in time for the wedding, the Princess moved into the rooms in the northwest corner and Emil August into the unfinished west wing. After his wife died in 1801, Emil August had her rooms changed for his own needs. The bastions around the palace were removed around the year 1800 without ever having been used in defence. Emil August's brother and successor, Friedrich IV did not live in the palace but in the town. His main contribution to the palace was bringing together the gallery of paintings from Friedenstein and other castles in the vicinity. This was located on the second floor of the west pavilion. Friedrich also created the Kunst- und Naturalienkabinett on the third floor of the north wing ‚Äì the nucleus of the Ducal museums. After the change in dynasties, the new Duke Ernst I von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha had the rooms in the northwest corner redesigned. His son Ernst II, however, did not live in the palace but at the ' in the town. With Friedenstein not used as a residential palace, the focus shifted to its function as administrative centre of the Duchy. Various changes occurred during the long reign of Ernst II: Space for the museum became too tight, so it was decided in 1863 to construct a specialised building. This new museum was built in 1864-79 south of the palace. After a new theatre had been built in town in 1837-40, the Ekhof-Theater lost its function as the main stage. In 1847, new stables ( Marstall ) were built, freeing up space in Friedenstein itself. Finally, in 1860/61 the main state apartments were fundamentally redecorated to bring them in line with the tastes of the times. The use of the palace changed again under Alfred. Despite the work done in the 1860s, the palace was not suitable for running a household in accordance with the demands of a ruling prince, lacking sufficient guest quarters for example. As a consequence, most of the Duchy‚Äôs administration was moved out of the palace and into the town. Substantial redecoration work was done to the state apartments at that time. The final round of redesigns occurred under Charles Edward after 1905. Many of the changes wrought by the final two princes were undone by renovation work after 1965, however. =Ekhof-Theater= Stage of the Ekhof-Theatre Located in the west pavilion, the Schlosstheater was built in 1681-87 by Caspar Lindemann and Hans Hoffmann. It is one of the oldest still operating theatres in Germany. Today, the theatre is named after its best-known Direktor. In 1774, an actor group led by Conrad (or Konrad) Ekhof, called \\"the father of German acting\\", came from Weimar to Gotha. Ekhof began working at the Schlosstheater and became Direktor of the newly created \\"court theatre\\" while acting in many plays himself. Having turned it into one of the leading theatres in Germany, after his death in 1778 the fame of the theatre declined rapidly. The current appearance of the theatre dates mostly to renovation in 1774/75, although the ceiling (looking like Coffer but actually printed on canvas) is still the original from the 1680s. In the 1770s, the balcony was extended and a second one added above. The theatre features a Baroque ' still in working condition, which makes it possible to change the scenery in view of the audience while the curtain is open. The mechanism was restored in the 1770s but is largely unchanged from 1683. =Parks= Friedenstein is surrounded by substantial gardens, developed individually but today linked into one park. The first garden was created even before the castle itself. The vegetable garden south of the castle was started in 1641/42. In 1645 and 1649, other gardens followed; the Hertzogin Lustg√§rtlein in the west and another Lustgarten to the east. Due to the existence of the massive fortifications around the castle, these first gardens were fairly small. Wasserkunst In 1707/08, a water feature was added north of the castle on the slope towards the town. Around 1700, the western Lustgarten was redesigned in a Barqoue style (this garden does not exist anymore today). More gardens were created east of the castle and in 1706 the eastern Lustgarten was also redesigned. From 1708 to 1711/14 the Friedrichsthaler Garten was created with a Lusthaus that eventually became the French Baroque style Schloss Friedrichsthal. Orangerie (northern building) Schloss Friedrichsthal Marstall (stables) Ducal Museum ‚Äì arthistorical museum of Gotha The axis between Friedrichsthal and Friedenstein was turned into the Orangeriegarten between 1747 and 1774, designed by . This is the oldest part of the gardens still in existence today. By the time it was finished, however, this type of garden had become unfashionable. After 1767, Ernst II combined the individual gardens into a single ensemble. The bastions were demolished and new sections added: * The English landscape garden to the south is based on ideas of Lancelot Brown and was originally designed by . It is one of the oldest such parks in continental Europe, built after 1769. * After 1779, the Herzoginnengarten was built, south of the Orangerie and in 1781 a Gothic revival building was added (Teeschl√∂sschen). * Finally, the fortifications were replaced by the Herz√∂gliche Anlagen. In the 19th century, only minor alterations were made to the gardens. After the change in dynasties, the English garden was opened to the public in 1827. In the second half of the 19th century the last remaining formal gardens were replaced - the new museum building and the Tannengarten replaced the kitchen garden in 1869-82. Major changes in the 20th century were limited to memorials and the areas immediately to the north and south of the castle proper. In 1904, the statue of Ernst der Fromme to the north was erected. This area between town and castle has since been restored in 1998, although it was previously occupied in turn by a fire pond, an air raid shelter and a parking area. South of the castle, a memorial to the dead of World War I was built in 1927 on the Reitplatz. In 1930, this area was part of the Deutsche Rosenschau. In 1947, the statue of the soldier was removed by the Soviet authorities and twenty years later replaced with a memorial to ‚Äúthe victims of fascism‚Äù. This memorial in turn was demolished in 2011. Today ', Gallery Gothaer Elephant (c. 1720), Schlossmuseum The palace houses the Schlossmuseum (state apartments), Museum der Natur (natural history) and the \\"Historical Museum Gotha\\" in the north and west wing, the ' in the west wing and the ' in the east wing. The Schlossmuseum currently combines the Baroque and neoclassical state apartments, the Ducal Kunstkammer, the Neue M√ºnzkabinett (numismatic collection) and the Ekhof-Theater. The gallery of paintings has been moved to the New Museum building outside the palace itself. This reorganisation is part of the general overhaul of the museums that began in 2010 under the label Barockes Universum Gotha (\\"Baroque universe Gotha\\").

He was credited with successfully advising the US against nuclear escalation in the 1970s. Background Des Ball attended the Australian National University in 1965, shifting from being a promising student in economics to security studies. He completed a PhD supervised by Hedley Bull, on the global nuclear strategies of the United States and the Soviet Union. He was based for several months in the USA at the Institute of War and Peace. He joined ANU as a lecturer in 1974, later becoming Special Professor in the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific in 1987. Ball was an opponent of the draft for the Vietnam War in Australia (although not the war itself, at the time), and was arrested for protesting against it. He won an appeal in the Supreme Court against his conviction. From 1966 he was a \\"person of interest\\" for ASIO, particularly following his inquiries into the Pine Gap secret tracking facility and Nurrungar in Australia from 1969, and was taken to court after the publication of A Suitable Piece of Real Estate in 1980. He held ASIO in disdain, for its inability to recognise aspects of defence co-operation with the US infringed Australian national interests by remaining entirely secret. Ball was diagnosed with incurable cancer and died on 12 October 2016 at the age of 69. Despite his illness, he continued writing and working until his death. Contributions Ball was a political realist, and a believer in liberal institutions and solid defence strategies. He used an inductive, investigative approach to security studies. During the Cold War, Ball was invited to critique US nuclear defence plans‚Äîhis analysis persuading the US that its plan to destroy selected Soviet targets in a limited strike would not work in practice and would lead to all-out nuclear escalation. His analysis has been acknowledged by President Jimmy Carter. Ball worked on Australia's signal intelligence and exposed Australia's secret history of cracking diplomatic cables. In 1998 with David Horner he confirmed wartime Soviet spying in Australia revealed by the Petrov Affair, carried out by staff in Evatt's Foreign Affairs Department. He studied, and was active in, some of Southeast Asia's \\"shadow wars\\". He was a supporter of Karen independence, having discovered the extent of Burmese Army human rights abuses, and advised the Karen National Liberation Army along the Thai/Myanmar border on successful guerrilla warfare from the early-2000s. He made over 85 research trips to the region. He worked with the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific, and believed the biggest threat in the early 21st century would be the potential for conflict escalation in north-east Asia.

History The station opened on 22 June 1901. Its original name was Kynochtown after the workers' village nearby. The original station had a wooden platform 100 ft long, with a building housing male and female toilets and a waiting shelter, also made of wood. It was lit by large oil lamps. During the First World War, the station's platform was extended at both ends in wood. In around 1917, a further extension in brick was added. After the war ended, the Kynoch site was sold to Cory Brothers of Cardiff and the station was subsequently renamed Coryton, along with the village. By this time, it was realised that the station (indeed the whole railway) would never be so busy again, so the wooden platform was demolished, leaving just the brick extension, with a ramp made from old sleepers added at its left end. The station building was resited at ground level a short distance away. The brick platform itself had one metal seat, but no other facilities. There were a number of sidings at the station, which became overgrown in later years. Closure The station closed when passenger services on the line ended in 1952. In the years immediately afterwards, the wooden building was demolished and the station became heavily infested with weeds. In 1986, the station was repaired by Mobil.

The 3-subset variant opens up the possibility to apply MITM attacks on ciphers, where it is not trivial to divide the keybits into two independent key-spaces, as required by the MITM attack. The 3-subset variant relaxes the restriction for the key-spaces to be independent, by moving the intersecting parts of the keyspaces into a subset, which contains the keybits common between the two key-spaces.  History  The original MITM attack was first suggested in an article by Diffie and Hellman in 1977, where they discussed the cryptanalytic properties of DES.Whitfield Diffie, Martin E. Hellman. \\"Exhaustive Cryptanalysis of the NBS Data Encryption Standard\\" They argued that the keysize of DES was too small, and that reapplying DES multiple times with different keys could be a solution to the key-size; however, they advised against using double-DES and suggested triple-DES as a minimum, due to MITM attacks (Double-DES is very susceptible to a MITM attack, as DES could easily be split into two subciphers (the first and second DES encryption) with keys independent of one another, thus allowing for a basic MITM attack that reduces the computational complexity from 2^{112} ( = 2^{2 \\\\times 56}) to 2^{57} ( = 2 \\\\times 2^{56}). Many variations has emerged, since Diffie and Hellman suggested MITM attacks. These variations either makes MITM attacks more effective, or allows them to be used in situations, where the basic variant cannot. The 3-subset variant was shown by Bogdanov and Rechberger in 2011,Andrey Bogdanov and Christian Rechberger. \\"A 3-Subset Meet-in-the-Middle Attack: Cryptanalysis of the Lightweight Block Cipher KTANTAN\\" and has shown its use in cryptanalysis of ciphers, such as the lightweight block-cipher family KTANTAN.  Procedure  As with general MITM attacks, the attack is split into two phases: A key-reducing phase and a key- verification phase. In the first phase, the domain of key-candidates is reduced, by applying the MITM attack. In the second phase, the found key- candidates are tested on another plain-/ciphertext pair to filter away the wrong key(s). = Key-reducing phase = In the key-reducing phase, the attacked cipher is split into two subciphers, f and g, with each their independent keybits, as is normal with MITM attacks. Instead of having to conform to the limitation that the keybits of the two subciphers should be independent, the 3-subset attack allows for splitting the cipher into two subciphers, where some of the bits are allowed to be used in both of the subciphers. This is done by splitting the key into three subsets instead, namely: * A_0 = the keybits the two subciphers have in common. * A_1 = the keybits distinct to the first subcipher, f. * A_2 = the keybits distinct to the second subcipher, g To now carry out the MITM attack, the 3 subsets are bruteforced individually, according to the procedure below: # For each guess of A_0: ## Calculate the intermediate value i from the plaintext, for all key- bit combinations in A_1 ## Calculate the intermediate value j, for all key-bit combinations in A_2 ## Compare i and j. When there is a match. Store it is a key-candidate. = Key-testing phase = Each key-candidate found in the key- reducing phase, is now tested with another plain-/ciphertext pair. This is done simply by seeing if the encryption of the plaintext, P, yields the known ciphertext, C. Usually only a few other pairs are needed here, which makes the 3-subset MITM attack, have a very little data complexity.  Example  The following example is based on the attack done by Rechberger and Bogdanov on the KTANTAN cipher-family. The naming-conventions used in their paper is also used for this example. The attack reduces the computational complexity of KTANTAN32 to 2^{75.170}, down from 2^{80} if compared with a bruteforce attack. A computational complexity of 2^{75.170} is of 2014 still not practical to break, and the attack is thus not computationally feasible as of now. The same goes for KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64, which complexities can be seen at the end of the example. The attack is possible, due to weaknesses exploited in KTANTAN's bit-wise key-schedule. It is applicable to both KTANTAN32, KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64, since all the variations uses the same key-schedule. It is not applicable to the related KANTAN family of block-ciphers, due to the variations in the key-schedule between KTANTAN and KANTAN. = Overview of KTANTAN = KTANTAN is a lightweight block-cipher, meant for constrained platforms such as RFID tags, where a cryptographic primitive such as AES, would be either impossible (given the hardware) or too expensive to implement. It was invented by Canniere, Dunkelman and Knezevic in 2009.Christophe De Canni√®re, Orr Dunkelman, Miroslav Kne≈æeviƒá. \\"KATAN & KTANTAN ‚Äî A Family of Small and Efficient Hardware-Oriented Block Ciphers\\" It takes a block size of either 32, 48 or 64 bits, and encrypts it using an 80-bit key over 254 rounds. Each round utilizes two bits of the key (selected by the key schedule) as round key. = Attack =  Preparation  In preparation to the attack, weaknesses in the key schedule of KTANTAN that allows the 3-subset MITM attack was identified. Since only two key-bits are used each round, the diffusion of the key per round is small - the safety lies in the number of rounds. Due to this structure of the key-schedule, it was possible to find a large number of consecutive rounds, which never utilized certain key-bits. More precisely, the authors of the attack found that: * Round 1 to 111 never uses the key-bits: k_{32}, k_{39}, k_{44}, k_{61}, k_{66}, k_{75} * Round 131 to 254 never uses the key-bits: k_{3}, k_{20}, k_{41}, k_{47}, k_{63}, k_{74} This characteristics of the key-schedule is used for staging the 3-subset MITM attack, as we now are able to split the cipher into two blocks with independent key-bits. The parameters for the attack are thus: * A_0 = the keybits used by both blocks (which means the rest 68 bits not mentioned above) * A_1 = the keybits used only by the first block (defined by round 1-111) * A_2 = the keybits used only by the second block (defined by round 131-254)  Key-reducing phase  One may notice a problem with step 1.3 in the key-reducing phase. It is not possible to directly compare the values of i and j, as i is calculated at the end of round 111, and j is calculated at the start of round 131. This is mitigated by another MITM technique called partial-matching. The authors found by calculating forwards from the intermediate value i, and backwards from the intermediate value j that at round 127, 8 bits was still unchanged in both i and j with a probability one. They thus only compared part of the state, by comparing those 8 bits (It was 8 bits at round 127 for KTANTAN32. It was 10 bits at round 123 and 47 bits at round 131 for KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64, respectively). Doing this yields more false positives, but nothing that increases the complexity of the attack noticeably.  Key-testing phase  KTANTAN32 requires on average 2 pairs now to find the key-candidate, due to the false positives from only matching on part of the state of the intermediate values. KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64 on average still only requires one plain-/ciphertext pair to test and find the correct key-candidates. = Results = For: * KTANTAN32, the computational complexity of the above attack is 2^{75.170}, compared to 2^{80} with an exhaustive key search. The data complexity is 3 plain-/ciphertext pairs. * KTANTAN48, the computational complexity is 2^{75.044} and 2 plain-/ciphertext pairs are needed. * KTANTAN64 it is 2^{75.584} and 2 plain-/ciphertext pairs are needed. The results are taken from the article by Rechberger and Bogdanov. This is not the best attack on KTANTAN anymore. The best attack as of 2011 is contributed to Wei, Rechberger, Guo, Wu, Wang and Ling which improved upon the MITM attack on the KTANTAN family.Lei Wei, Christian Rechberger, Jian Guo, Hongjun Wu, Huaxiong Wang, and San Ling. \\"Improved Meet-in-the-Middle Cryptanalysis of KTANTAN\\" They arrived at a computational complexity of 2^{72.9} with 4 chosen plain-/ciphertext pairs using indirect partial-matching and splice & cut MITM techniques.

Partial- matching is where the intermediate values of the MITM attack, i and j, computed from the plaintext and ciphertext, are matched on only a few select bits, instead of on the complete state.  Uses  A limitation with MITM attacks is the amount of intermediate values that needs to be stored. In order to compare the intermediate values i and j, all i's need to be computed and stored first, before each computed j can be compared against them. If the two subciphers identified by the MITM attack both has a sufficiently large subkey, then an unfeasible amount of intermediate values need to be stored. While there are techniques such as cycle detection algorithmsCycle detection that allows one to perform a MITM attack without storing either all values of i or j, these techniques requires that the subciphers of the MITM attack are symmetric. Thus it is a solution that allows one to perform a MITM attack in a situation, where the subkeys are of a cardinality just large enough to make the amount of temporary values that need to be stored infeasible. While this allows one to store more temporary values, its use is still limited, as it only allows one to perform a MITM attack on a subcipher with a few more bits. As an example: If only 1/8 of the intermediate value is stored, then the subkey needs only be 3 bits larger, before the same amount of memory is required anyway, since 2^{-3} = 1/8 A in most cases far more useful feature provided by partial-matching in MITM attacks, is the ability to compare intermediate values computed at different rounds in the attacked cipher. If the diffusion in each round of the cipher is low enough, it might be possible over a span of rounds to find bits in the intermediate states that has not changed with a probability of 1. These bits in the intermediate states can still be compared. The disadvantage for both of these uses, is that there will be more false positives for key candidates, which needs to be tested. As a rule, the chance for a false positive is given by the probability 2^{-i}, where i is the amount of matched bits.  Example  For a step-by-step example of the complete attack on KTANTAN,Andrey Bogdanov and Christian Rechberger. \\"A 3-Subset Meet-in-the-Middle Attack: Cryptanalysis of the Lightweight Block Cipher KTANTAN\\" see the example on the 3-subset MITM page. This example only deals with the part that needs partial-matching. What is useful to know is that KTANTAN is a 254-round blockcipher, where each round uses 2 bits from the 80-bit key. In the 3-subset attack on the KTANTAN family of ciphers, it was necessary to utilize partial-matching in order to stage the attack. Partial-matching was needed, because the intermediate values of the plain- and ciphertext in the MITM attack, were computed at the end of round 111 and at the start of round 131, respectively. Since they had a span of 20 rounds between them, they could not be compared directly. The authors of the attack, however, identified some useful characteristics of KTANTAN that held with a probability of 1. Due to the low diffusion per round in KTANTAN (the security is in the number of rounds), they found out by computing forwards from round 111 and backwards from round 131 that at round 127, 8 bits from both intermediate states would remain unchanged. (It was 8 bits at round 127 for KTANTAN32. It was 10 bits at round 123 and 47 bits at round 131 for KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64, respectively). by only comparing the 8 bits of each intermediate value, the authors was able to orchestrate a MITM attack on the cipher, despite there being 20 rounds between the two subciphers. Using partial-matching increased the amount of false positives, but nothing that noticeably increased the complexity of the attack.

Hollywood and Swine was created in January 2012 in Hollywood, CA by co-founders Andy Marx and William McArdle, who for a time remained anonymous. The idea for the website was inspired by the satirical news source The Onion, and the name originates from the road intersection of Hollywood and Vine in Hollywood, CA. Hollywood and Swine uses photoshopped images and over-the-top headlines to play off of real news stories by adding a fake twist. Their efforts are supported by advertising sales. Hollywood and Swine's slogan is \\"So many pigs...so little time\\". Marx and McArdle stated that \\"the key [of Hollywood and Swine] is to do something so funny that you can get away with being tasteless\\" (The Guardian, 2012). Hollywood and Swine has fast become a regular news source for those looking to the lives of celebrities as a source of entertainment.  Growth  In March of 2012, Hollywood and Swine got their big break from publication of their satirical article \\"Starbucks Bans Screenwriters From All 19,435 Locations Worldwide; Writers Guild of America Vows to Fight the Decision\\". The article stated that writers bring a morose air into the coffee shop's environment and therefore were banned from coming inside. The article offended and outraged readers and consequently brought a considerable amount of traffic to the Hollywood and Swine website. Their second big break came from their article \\"Sharon Stone Named Suspect in Cannes Jewel Heist After Police Realize She Hasn't Been A Movie Star In Years\\". The article facetiously suggested that actress Sharon Stone was a suspect in a jewel heist because of her lack of movie presence at the time. The article created a great deal of controversy and resulted in an appreciable amount of traffic to the website. These two articles were catalysts in making Hollywood and Swine a Hollywood staple.  Andy Marx and William McArdle  Andy Marx and William McArdle are the co- founders and writers of Hollywood and Swine. Both Marx and McArdle attempted to stay anonymous, but in the end, their names were outed. Andy Marx is the grandson of both comedian and famed television and film actor Groucho Marx, and famed songwriter Gus Kahn. He is the son of Arthur Marx and Irene Kahn, and the brother of Steve Marx. Marx, in addition to being a journalist, is an author, photographer, and a musician. In addition to being a writer, McArdle is also a screenwriter and has written the television/movie scripts Unhitched, A Year of Living Without Her (written with Marx), Take Your Kid to Work Day (written with Marx), and Paroled (written with Marx).  Reception  Although some find the Hollywood and Swine articles to be less than profound, many enjoy their take on the lives of the rich and famous. They are generally well received in Hollywood even by those who they have written articles about. Actor Edward Burns, in reply to an article written about him stated, \\"It is mean spirited, but I got a good chuckle out of it. It was very funny\\" (The Guardian, 2012). On an average news day Hollywood and Swine has about 2,500-4,000 visitors. On a big news day, such as a day when an article of theirs goes viral, they can expect around 30,000 visitors to the site.  Controversy  As one of their typical satirical posts, Hollywood and Swine released an article titled \\"Sharon Stone Named Suspect in Cannes Jewel Heist After Police Realize She Hasn't Been A Movie Star In Years\\". Without scanning the articles for validity first, the news outlets The Chicago Tribune and Yahoo! News both released the story as if it were real. Both received backlash for releasing satirical articles and mixing them with real news.  References  *\\"Andy Marx.\\" IMDb. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0555583/IMDb.com, n.d.

Dixie Leavitt is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Early career  Dixie's plan throughout college was to become a schoolteacher. In 1951, after graduating from BAC, he began teaching fourth grade at Cedar West Elementary School. After that first year, during the summer of 1952, Dixie got a job selling insurance. Though he fully intended to return to teaching in the fall, during the week before school began, the manager of the insurance company paid him a visit and urged him to stay in the insurance business. Dixie loved the business and believed he could prosper, so he decided to remain. Dixie's first insurance office was a desk in his family's small basement apartment.Dixie Leavitt a Cedar City institution. His business prospered and in 1959, Dixie partnered with his brother Bert Leavitt to create the first Leavitt Group affiliated agency. Dixie created the model based on the principle of aligned interests between the Leavitt Group (which maintains contractual control) and its local managing co-owners (who maintain client control). Dixie's business grew as he partnered with other individuals and insurance agencies using the 60/40 ownership arrangement. This unique, new model worked because sharing significant ownership and profits provided the natural incentives to make each agency thrive. Unlike a typical aggregator, The Leavitt Group's \\"60/40\\" model gave independent agents a new alternative to their growth and perpetuation needs. The local manager could remain an owner and take responsibility for the local agency culture. As a result, numerous agencies have embraced this model, and today the Leavitt Group is ranked as one of the largest privately held insurance brokerages in the United States.

As a legislator, he worked to obtain four-year status for the College of Southern Utah (CSU), which was among his first legislative successes. Another notable legislative achievement was his bill that became the Utah Higher Education Act of 1969. One of the crowning accomplishments of his service in the Utah State Senate was the advancement to university status of Southern Utah University.

Science, 124 (3212) (July 20, 1956):122-123 Life and Education Marinelli was born of Italian parents in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on November 28, 1906, eldest son of 6 children of bank owner Vincenzo Marinelli and Amelia Sammartino Marinelli. He was age 11 when his father died of a heart attack and he returned with his widowed mother and her children to the family seat in Agnone, Italy, where the Marinelli family established their bell foundry in the 12th century. Leonidas graduated the Volta Institute of Naples, October, 1925, with highest honors and a gold Queen Victoria coin. Two months after his nineteenth birthday, he emigrated to New York City and supported himself as a meter tester while working his way through Cooper Union Night School of Electrical Engineering. In 1929 he was hired by Dr. Gioacchino Failla, former student of Marie Curie, to the biophysical laboratory at Memorial Cancer Hospital, New York City, known today as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). Hardly a year later, Leonidas measured the gamma ray intensities of radium, previously unquantified, in electrostatic units which were convertible to the x-ray roentgen unit. This made possible the comparison of xrays and gamma rays, later useful to evaluations of cancer therapies. By 1933 he coauthored his first publication with Failla, Edith Quimby, and John E. Rose. In 1935 he became Assistant Physicist. In 1938 he completed all course requirements for the PhD at Columbia University and had published 5 papers in radiological journals. Career and Profession In the 1940s Marinelli became an independent scientist. In 1941 his papers dealt with post- irradiation blood studies and with early tracer work on cancer; in 1942 with the production of chromosomal breaks in plant cells and with the theory of time distribution of radiation treatments. In February, 1942, he published the theoretical basis for internal radiation dosimetry that provided the basis for nuclear medicine. In 1946, he published its systematic application to the radioactive treatment of functional cancer of the thyroid. This breakthrough was followed by autoradiography techniques and by a Review of Modern Physics report on beta rays. The explosive growth of radiation medicine enlarged his responsibilities as Head of Physics at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Institute. In 1948 he added to his publication of internal radiation dosimetry the supplementary biological considerations contributed by Edith Quimby. In 1948 he moved to the Argonne National Laboratory, with a position on the University of Chicago faculty. Here, with John Rose, he provided early leadership and scientific direction of the Radiological Physics Division and concurrently the Biology and Medical Ressearch DivisionArgonne National Laboratory Report-4488, Report 4571. He authored review articles on dosimetry in the Annual Review of Nuclear Science, in Radiation Biology, and in the Handbook of Medical Radiology. His studies of physics dealt now with electron diffusion from point sources in air, and with the cosmic ray background. In radiology he pioneered the detection of minimal burdens of radioactivity in humans, studying their distribution and variation in tissues and the epidemiology of chronic low levels of radiationRADIATION RESEARCH, Vol 61, No 3, Mar., 1975, Pp 538-539. \\"Obituary: Leonidas D.

A detector, usually a glass GM tube designed for gamma counting, was positioned in the central tube while the beaker was filled with the sample. Since the sample effectively surrounded the detector, the counting efficiency was greater than would be the case if the sample were in any other type of container. The following footnote regarding the Marinelli beaker is found in a report by R.F. Hill, G.J. Hine and L.D.

Deportations of the Ingrian Finns were a series of mass deportations of the Ingrian Finnish population by Soviet authorities. Deportations took place from the late 1920s to the end of World War II. Background Lutheran Finns had lived in Ingria for over 400 years, since the period of Swedish rule. They had immigrated there from Finland and the Karelian Isthmus and eventually started referring to themselves as Ingrian Finns.Taagepera (2013), p. 143Adler, Leydesdorff, Chamberlain, and Neyzi (2011), p. 61 In 1919 the population of the Ingrian Finns was 132,000 in Ingria and an additional 10,000 in Petrograd. The Finnish-Soviet peace treaty of 1920 had granted Ingrian Finns a degree of national autonomy. A national district was formed in 1928 and Finnish was used in schools, radio and administration.Taagepera (2013), p. 144 Deportations Soviet repression of the Ingrian Finns started at the same time as the forced collectivization in the Soviet Union in 1928. Between 1929 and 1931 Soviet authorities deported 18,000 people from areas near the Finnish border, consisting of up to 16% of the total Ingrian Finnic population. All remaining Finns in four border parishes were deported in 1936 and replaced with Russians. In 1937 all Finnish-language schools, publications, broadcasts, and Ingrian Lutheran churches were closed down. During 1937-1938, 4,000 Ingrian Finns were shot and over 10,000 deported to prison camps.Adler, Leydesdorff, Chamberlain, and Neyzi (2011), p. 62 By 1939 the Ingrian Finnish population had decreased to about 50,000, which was about 43% of 1928 population figures, and the Ingrian Finn national district was abolished. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the Leningrad Blockade, in early 1942 all 20,000 Ingrian Finns remaining in Soviet-controlled territory were deported to Siberia. Most of the Ingrian Finns together with Votes and Izhorians living in German-occupied territory were evacuated to Finland in 1943-1944. After Finland sued for peace, it was forced to return the evacuees. Soviet authorities did not allow the 55,733 people who had been handed over to settle back in Ingria, and instead deported them to central regions of Russia.Scott and Liikanen (2013), pp. 59-60 The main regions of Ingrian Finns forced settlement were the interior areas of Siberia, Central Russia, and Tajikistan.Evmenov and Muslimov (2010), p. 92 Aftermath The deportations led to the rapid ethnic assimilation of Ingrian Finns. After 1956, return to Ingria was officially allowed but made unfeasible in practice; as a result, many settled in the nearby Finnic regions of Estonia and Karelia. In 1989 there were 18,000 Finns in Ingria and Leningrad, and a total of 67,813 in the Soviet Union, with only 34.7 percent declaring Finnish as their main language.

The bill also would have extended the authority of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to collect travel promotion fees from certain foreign individuals traveling to the United States. Those fees were to be used to partially fund Brand USA. The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives, but was not passed in the Senate. It expired at the conclusion of the 113th United States Congress. Background The Travel Promotion Act of 2009 () created the Corporation for Travel Promotion (also known as Brand USA), a public- private partnership tasked with promoting tourism in the United States. To fund the Corporation's activities, the Act provides for a fee of $10 for use of the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). The goal of the organization is to increase international travel to the United States. Prior to 2010, the United States was \\"the only major travel destination worldwide that did not have a national travel and tourism marketing organization.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014 would amend the Travel Promotion Act of 2009 (TPA) to revise qualifications requirements for members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation for Travel Promotion. The bill would revise requirements for the Corporation's annual report to the United States Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to require a description of and rationales for: (1) the Corporation's efforts to focus on specific countries and populations, and (2) its combination of media channels employed in meeting the promotional objectives of its marketing campaign. The bill would direct the Corporation and the Secretary (or their designees) to meet biannually to review procedures to determine the fair market value of goods and services received by the Corporation from non-federal sources. Reduces from 80% to 75% the percentage of the fair market value of those goods and services the Corporation may receive from non-federal sources each fiscal year, increasing from 20% to 25% the federal matching rate. The bill would include U.S. territories among the states and the District of Columbia whose benefit the Corporation's international travel promotion plan must ensure. The bill would extend the TPA and the Corporation through FY2020. The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend through FY2020 also the authority of the United States Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to charge a fee for use of the electronic travel authorization system to determine, in advance, an alien's eligibility to travel to the United States. The bill would amend the TPA to require the Corporation to establish performance metrics to: (1) measure the impact of its marketing efforts, and (2) demonstrate any cost or benefit to the U.S. economy. The bill would require the Corporation to report to Congress actions it has taken in response to any recommendations the Government Accountability Office (GAO) might make to it. The bill would require the Corporation to: (1) establish a competitive procurement process, and (2) certify in its annual report to Congress that any contracts it has entered into were in compliance with that process. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 15, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4450 would extend the provisions of the Travel Promotion Act of 2009 (), which established the Corporation for Travel Promotion (also known as Brand USA), through September 30, 2020, and impose new performance and procurement requirements on the corporation. The bill also would extend the authority of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to collect travel promotion fees from certain foreign individuals traveling to the United States. Those fees are used to partially fund Brand USA. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 4450 would increase direct spending by $500 million and revenues by $731 million over the 2015-2024 period, resulting in a net decrease in the deficit of $231 million over the 10-year period. Pay-as- you-go procedures apply because enacting the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues. CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4450 would not significantly affect discretionary spending. H.R. 4450 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 10, 2014 by Rep. Gus M. Bilirakis (R, FL-12). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the United States House Committee on Homeland Security, the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security. On July 15, 2014, it was ordered reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-542 part 1 by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. On July 22, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 433 to pass the bill 347-57. All of the no votes were made by Republicans. Debate and discussion The American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) supported the bill. ASTA President Zane Kerby said that the bill \\"is essential to marketing the United States as a desirable destination for international tourists, conferences and business.\\" The U.S. Travel Association also supported the bill. One study of the program by Oxford Economics indicated that the program \\"generates an estimated $47 in economic benefits for every $1 spent on travel promotion.\\" The organization Heritage Action for America opposed the bill.

Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology of Hyderabad at the Beas River in Himachal Pradesh. The accident took place in the Thalout area (Shalanala Village) of Mandi district and was the result of a sudden surge of river water released upstream from the Larji hydro electric project.Beas tragedy: Another student's body recovered : India, News - India Today Incident 48 students and three faculty/staff members of the V.N.R. Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology (Hyderabad) were on an educational/industrial tour from Shimla to Manali, about 200 kilometres (130 miles) from Himachal Pradesh capital Shimla. Some of them were photographing themselves on the banks of the Beas river on the Mandi-Manali National Highway NH-21, when they were washed away as the water flow in the river suddenly increased. The surge of water occurred when the Larji hydroelectric power project opened its floodgates, sending tonnes of water downstream. The dam water was released suddenly by the dam authorities without prior notice. Two students and Biswas Nandamuri were alarmed when men on the shore collecting sand began to point and yell \\"Dam\\" just a few seconds before the water gushed in. Footage surfaced on the internet two days after the incident which showed how the victims were caught unaware before the river carried them away. The video was shot by Bihari Lal, who was present about 100 metres above the river bed on a hilly area where a wedding was being held . Sensing the dangerHimachal Pradesh Tragedy - How some students saved their friends lives? - HP Tragedy and Asish Mantha selflessly started helping the other students to reach the river bank. It has been reported by the surviving students that Kiran Kumar Muppidi had saved five fellow students before he slipped away. Devasish Bose was seen fighting hard to save one of the fellow students before he went missing. According to first hand witness the unofficial tour guide had jumped into the current to save some students. Rescue Authorities deployed over 550 rescue team members including divers from NDRF, Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), and Indo-Tibetan Border Police ITBP, Indian Army, Indian Navy, the Paramilitary, the local firemen and policemen, and a private team of swimmers and divers trained by the Additional DGP of Police (Sports) in Telangana, Mr. Rajeev Trivedi. UAVs, multi-beam sonar, and lidar were also deployed to trace missing students along the 15 km stretch from Larji Dam to Pandoh Dam. Beginning 16 June, the parents of the students who were camping in Himachal Pradesh started leaving for their native places. The bodies of all 23 students and the tour guide were recovered. Kalluri Sree Harsha's body was not recovered. Government response =Probe= A case has been registered against officials of the Larji Hydroelectric Project and College for causing the death of 24 engineering students through negligence. The case was registered after eyewitnesses claimed that the hooter was not sounded before the flow of water into the river was increased. An initial probe suggested that Larji power project was asked to reduce generation on the day of the tragedy but that plant officials instead shut it down. As a result of this, the water that had built up in its reservoir needed to be released, leading to a sudden surge in the Beas river. It has been reported by some news agencies that the Larji hydroelectric power project has been involved with local sand mafia and this was what made the officials open the gates without proper control. Compensation The Himachal High Court awarded compensation of 2,000,000 rupees to parents of students to paid in a ratio of 60:30:10 by the electricity board, the college and the state of Himachal Pradesh.https://factly.in/himachal-pradesh-tragedy-college-students- compenstation-20-lakh-rupees-to-parents-beas-river/ References  Category:2014 disasters in India Category:History of Himachal Pradesh (1947‚Äìpresent) Category:2010s in Himachal Pradesh Category:Disasters in Himachal Pradesh Category:Maritime incidents in India Category:Students in India Category:Filmed accidental deaths Category:Education in Telangana Category:Mandi district Category:Accidental deaths in India Category:Deaths by drowning Category:June 2014 events in Asia ","title":"2014 Beas River Tragedy"},{"id":"43027574","text":"Logothetis () is a Greek surname derived from the Byzantine title of logothetes.

At the same time, a spaceship lands in the colony, and Samar's alien fianc√©e 930square or 2 by 2, enters, taking the human form of a vamp from a TV serial, \\"Bahu Meri Beti Nahin, Samdhan Dahez Deti Nahin\\". Samar explains that since he never loved 2 by 2, he was against the marriage and that was the reason he escaped to earth in the first place! At last, 2 by 2 agrees, as Samar was already married to Sonachandi, had a son Maakhan, and Sonachandi was pregnant with their second child. Afraid that Daulat Ram will expose their secret to the Bureau of Alien Research (BAIR), who would catch them to conduct experiments, Ghotalas decide to leave Earth immediately and move to their home planet, along with Sonachandi and Heeramoti. They also take Daulatram forcefully with them. In the spaceship, Sonachandi explains her father Daulatram, who is still in a shock, that the Ghotalas, though aliens, are not bad, and are in fact better than a lot of humans. He later apologizes to Ghotalas about his behavior towards them and agrees to stay with Maakhan in Ghotala's planet. That is when they realize that they forgot Shishir and Maakhan at the earth itself. Thus they decide to return to earth, and crash lands on earth for the third time. The colony people are very happy about hearing the explosion of a spaceship landing, as they know Ghotalas have returned but at the same time worried as Daulat Ram is also back. In the last scene of the show, Maakhan is shown thinking that now since the Ghotalas have been exposed to Daulatram and his sibling is coming soon, it would be more interesting to watch the Vasant-Daulatram clash.

BHIC's mission is barrier island conservation, preservation and education. It is located in the Smith Island Complex in Brunswick County, North Carolina, which includes Bald Head Island, Middle and Bluff Islands, all of which are bounded by the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean. BHIC sponsors and facilitates scientific research that benefits coastal communities and provides numerous recreational and educational activities for students, educators, visitors, and residents. In coordination with various organizations, partnerships and collaborations, the Conservancy has led the nation in conservation and research efforts and is uniquely poised to become a leader in Barrier Island Conservation world-wide.  Preservation  BHIC and its subsidiary, the Smith Island Land Trust, are dedicated to protecting critical habitats through conservation easements and land donations. The Smith Island Land Trust has been instrumental in preserving 9,000 acres of land and marsh in its natural state. Of the 2,000 acres of developable land, the Trust has preserved 347 acres and currently holds the deeds on 37 acres.  Conservation  The Bald Head Island Conservancy employs management and restoration strategies to protect the fragile ecosystems of the Smith Island Complex. Currently the Conservancy is involved in the research of sea turtles, vivex/invasive species, maritime forest, water quality, alligators, oysters, dunes, amphibians, deer, and painted buntings. = Sea Turtle Program = In cooperation with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Conservancy's Sea Turtle Protection Program has been in operation since 1983,. As one of NMFS's \\"index beaches\\", Bald Head Island is nationally recognized for its sea turtle nesting activity, and for the Conservancy's efforts to protect this resource. The Conservancy is the only non-government entity in North Carolina that is permitted to conduct turtle identification and satellite-tracking of sea turtles. Saturation tagging, that is tagging every possible female, provides a census of all nesting females. Data collected from nesting sea turtles includes GPS nest locations; flipper tag data; PIT tagging; straight and curved line carapace dimensions; and occasionally satellite tagging. Each summer, BHIC funds and houses interns to conduct field work for the Sea Turtle Protection Program, under the direction of a sea turtle biologist. The interns are typically undergraduates majoring in natural resource related fields. The majority of the interns‚Äô summer is spent patrolling for nesting sea turtles from dusk until dawn on an all terrain vehicle. After the nesting female returns to the ocean, interns protect the nest from predation by burying a protective wire cage around the nest thus preventing raccoons, foxes, and dogs from disturbing the nest, while allowing the hatchlings to emerge unimpeded. Nests laid in a suboptimal location may be relocated to a safer location. Eggs may be in danger if they are laid below or close to the high tide line, in an area of high foot traffic, or of low sand quality. A nest can be relocated within the first six hours after it was laid, which is facilitated by our intensive beach patrolling. Since the incubation time for sea turtles in our locale is approximately sixty days, the Conservancy hosts sea turtle hatching events from late July through mid-October. After a nest has hatched, or if the nest is overdue, it will be excavated to determine nesting success. Success is determined by counting the number of eggs that successfully hatched vs. the total in the nest. This is evident by the number of empty eggs left in the nest along with the number of unhatched eggs. Frequently, viable hatchlings are rescued and released on the beach so they can make their way to the ocean. Most of the sea turtles that visit the Smith Island Complex are loggerheads (Caretta caretta), but occasionally Atlantic green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) will visit. Sea turtle nesting on Bald Head Island has experienced a general downward trend over the past 25 years but through the protection efforts of the Bald Head Island Conservancy, the number of nesting females should begin increasing in the years to come.  Education  BHIC's programs allow participants of all ages to gain hands-on knowledge about the value and vulnerability of barrier island environments. = Adventure Programs = Guided Kayak Tours; Turtle Walks (Participants can observe 300 lb. loggerhead sea turtles coming ashore to nest under the cover of darkness or view tiny hatchlings emerging from their nest); Sea Turtle Patrol Ride Along; Birding BHI; Bald Head After Dark; Hands on Dissections; Movies; Naturalist Corner; Reptile Round-Up; Beachcombing; Crabbing and Cast Nesting; Island Gators; Salt Marsh Treks; Island Nature Tours; Maritime Forest Hikes; Middle Island Ibis Lake Sanctuary Tour; and Fishing Schools (The Conservancy has offered three fishing schools for over two decades) = Summer Camps = The Conservancy holds camps for all ages each summer.  Barrier Island Study Center  The BISC is the first community-based barrier island research and education facility in the nation. The building itself is LEED Gold Certified with wood salvaged from the bottom of the Cape Fear River, energy efficient lighting, and a 6,800 gallon rainwater collection system. Due to Bald Head Island's unique environment, researchers at the BISC have access to ten miles of beaches and dunes, 10,000 acres of salt marsh, 4,000 acres of barrier island \\"upland\\" and 193 acres of preserved maritime forest. The BISC includes large classrooms, a wet and a dry laboratory, viewing rooms, and dormitories. The BISC is affiliated with researchers from Wake Forest University, UNC- Wilmington, NC State University, Duke University, East Carolina University, and Virginia Commonwealth University.

PLATHEE is an acronym for \\"Platform for Energy- Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Hybrid Trains\\". Overview BB 63413 is a demonstration platform built from a BB 63000 shunting locomotive and introduced in April 2009. The 63413 is designed to perform two functions common to the 63000 platform: switching (hump yard) service and urban service (operation within 20‚Äì40 km of a freight station). Prime movers The locomotive uses a downsized diesel engine and a 50 kW HELION fuel cell to provide power. Running tests were done with the fuel cell in September 2009 but it was removed in October 2009 and later running tests were made without it. The project was financed by the French Government through the Environment and Energy Management Agency and several industrial partners. Traction motors From the base BB63413 locomotive, only the frame, the bogies and the 4 DC electric motors were retained for the demonstrator model. The maximum speed attained during testing was 79.6 km/h. Energy storage The program was to use the Nickel Zinc technology, but due to difficulty in obtaining the necessary batteries, Nickel Cadmium batteries were used instead. The batteries are of 138 Ah, providing 50 kWh of stored energy. There are also 4 ultracapacitor modules, of 25F per module, providing 4 x 3 kWh of stored energy. The locomotive is designed to operate at various operating speeds and can also use biodiesel as a fuel.

Retail prices for the Sigma 50mm lens had not yet been announced but it was initially expected that it would sell for around US$1350. However, when official pricing was announced on April 11, 2014, the retail price was even lower: US$950. Lens reviews of the Sigma 50mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art have been largely very positive, and have confirmed the expectations that it is significantly sharper than the 50mm f/1.4 prime offerings by Canon and Nikon while also significantly cheaper. Chromatic aberration is minimal across the aperture range, as is distortion, and the lens is sharpest at f/5.6, after which it is marginally softer as diffraction effects become more prominent.

In Bladenboro, it shares concurrencies with NC 242 and NC 410 along its Main Street crossing NC 211 Business at Seaboard Street. It soon splits from NC 242, which continues north to Elizabethtown, followed by crossing NC 211 By-Pass, before leaving Bladenboro. later, it splits from NC 410, which continues north to Dublin. At NC 41, NC 131 has a brief overlap; it is noticeable that the routing here was reconfigured to slowdown NC 131 at this location. At the end of its journey, NC 131 meets with NC 87, in Tar Heel; where travelers can continue on to Fayetteville or Elizabethtown. NC 131 goes through predominantly forested or farmlands in the area, with Bladenboro being the only urban location along its route. History NC 131 was established in 1949 as a new primary routing from US 701 north of Whiteville to NC 87 in Tar Heel. In 1970, NC 131 was rerouted onto a new road east of downtown Tar Heel. In 2015, NC 131 was realigned on new road and brief overlap with NC 41, eliminating an intersection; old alignment was downgraded to secondary roads, with some partial removal of roadway.

After following his uncle into the service of the British East India Company, he became wealthy and returned to England, although he was frustrated in an attempt to obtain a directorship of the company. His wealth and his friendship with Lord Caledon enabled him to sit in Parliament for various boroughs until 1818, although he was not a particularly conspicuous member. He died at his country home in Devonshire in 1820. Childhood and Indian career Born about 1761, Josias was the third son of Paul Porcher, a planter of Charleston, South Carolina, and his wife Esther Du Pr√©. Esther was the sister of Josias Du Pr√©, an East India merchant. Porcher moved to England in 1768 under the patronage of his uncle Josias, who was President of Madras from 1770 to 1773. Porcher not unnaturally took up a career in India as well, and became a writer of the British East India Company in Madras in 1778. He received a legacy of ¬£1,000 at the death of his uncle in 1780. From 1783 to 1786, he was deputy to the deputy paymaster in Madras, and in 1785, was made a senior merchant. In 1790, he was appointed to the company's Board of Trade and was made clerk to the committee of works. Porcher served as mayor of Madras from 1791 to 1792 and was appointed military storekeeper at Madras in the latter year. Porcher returned home in 1796, bearing a diamond sword presented by the nawab of Arcot to the Prince of Wales. He invested ¬£2,000 in the 1797 loyalty loan. Porcher sought to become a director of the East India Company with the aid of the Alexander family, who had achieved prominence through a fortune also made in India. His uncle Josias had married Rebecca Alexander, sister of James Alexander, 1st Earl of Caledon and aunt of Caledon's nephews Henry and James. Henry, a schoolmate of Porcher's, recommended him to Thomas Pelham as a friend of the family, and Porcher assured Pelham of his attachment to government and his friendship with Lord Hobart. However, Porcher did not receive a directorship, and later joined James Alexander and Edward Fletcher as partners in founding Porcher & Co., a firm of East India agents in 1804. In Parliament  In 1802, he loaned ¬£25,000 to Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford for six years in exchange for a Parliamentary seat, and was duly returned for Pitt's borough of Bodmin. In the same year, he also brokered the purchase of the burgages of Old Sarum from Camelford by Du Pre Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon. He was Member of Parliament for Bletchingley from 1806 to 1807, for Dundalk in 1807, and for Old Sarum from 1807 to 1818. He was a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber from 1818 to his death in 1820. He married, on 1 Nov. 1787 at Fort George, Madras, Charlotte, the daughter of Admiral Sir William Burnaby, 1st Baronet of Broughton Hall, Oxfordshire. They had 4 sons and a daughter.

Early life Samuel Walker was born on October 19, 1822 in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. After marrying Marian E. Lowe in 1842, Walker moved to Ohio in 1848, and worked there as a cabinet maker. In 1855 he settled permanently in Lawrence, Kansas. There Walker became a founding member of the Bloomington Guards, a local militia company, in late 1855, and he was quickly elected first sergeant. In the following year Walker was elected colonel of the 4th Kansas Cavalry, which participated in all the campaigns of the free-state men during Bleeding Kansas. In that capacity Walker was present at the sieges of Lawrence and Fort Saunders, and commanded free-state forces on August 16, 1856 at the Battle of Fort Titus, which was a free-state victory. In 1856 Walker served as a member of the short-lived Territorial House of Representatives under the Topeka Constitution, and around the same time he also was a Deputy U.S. Marshal. Walker became the sheriff of Douglas County, Kansas in October 1857 and served until January 1862. Civil War After the American Civil War began in April 1861, Walker volunteered to fight for the Union, and he was commissioned the captain of Company F, 1st Kansas Volunteer Infantry Regiment on June 1, 1861. In this capacity, Walker commanded the company at the Battle of Wilson's Creek, Missouri on August 10, 1861, where his regiment sustained over 50% casualties. Walker was promoted to a major of the 5th Kansas Volunteer Cavalry Regiment on May 24, 1862, before being promoted lieutenant colonel of the 16th Kansas Volunteer Cavalry Regiment in October 1864. Walker participated in opposing Price's Raid in Missouri and Kansas during the fall of 1864. In the wave of mass promotions by brevet at the war's end, he received brevet promotions to colonel and brigadier general dated to March 13, 1865. The Powder River Expedition In mid 1865, Major General Grenville M. Dodge ordered an expedition as a punitive campaign against the Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho. Led by Brigadier General Patrick E. Connor, its strategy was to have three independently marching columns of soldiers converge upon the Sioux and Cheyenne in the Powder River Country. Walker was assigned command of the middle, or center column. The column was made up of eight companies of his own 16th Kansas Cavalry joined by Company H of the 15th Kansas Cavalry with two mountain howitzer cannon. He had an aggregate force of 600 mounted men. The column started north from Fort Laramie in early August 1865 and traversed the country west of the Black Hills in Dakota Territory. Marching into Montana Territory, the command suffered from bad water, weather, supply shortages, and harassing Indian attacks. Though the western column led by Connor was able to construct Fort Connor (later renamed Fort Reno), the army was neither able to defeat the Indians nor to pacify the region. All of the forces in the field were recalled to Fort Laramie, and the 16th Kansas Cavalry along with Colonel Walker were mustered out in December 1865. Later life In 1865 Walker was named Major General of the Kansas Militia, and he held this rank for ten years. Walker served as the sheriff of Douglas County again, from 1868 to 1872, and as a City Marshall, to which he was elected in 1872. He was also a Republican in the State Senate from 1872 until 1874. Samuel Walker died on February 6, 1893, in Lawrence, Kansas, and is buried there in Oak Hill Cemetery.

He is also the nephew of Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou and was instrumental in the negotiation and release of Taiwanese citizen Chang An-wei, or Evelyn Chang, from Abu Sayyaf militants in the Philippines. Background and education Gene Yu was born in Concord, Massachusetts on October 26, 1979 and moved to Northern California in 1988, where he grew up. He is of Hakka ancestry. Yu's mother is the younger sister of Taiwanese President Ma Ying- jeou. Although he is the nephew of President Ma, he had little contact with him while growing up. Yu matriculated into West Point at 17 and received his commission in June 2001. His first command was as a tank platoon and mortar platoon leader along the demilitarized zone in South Korea. He joined the Special Forces in 2006. During the final stages of his U.S. Army Special Forces Qualification Course in December 2005, Yu was in the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) phase of the program. In accordance with the requirements of the training, Yu only carried his military ID card and a knife. Yu and his classmates were also expected to learn to live off the land, and as such, ate very little. In the final days of the evasion portion of the school and motivated by hunger, Yu left the boundaries of the exercise and came upon a group of Guatemalans in the North Carolina forest. Using Spanish skills acquired during extensive foreign travel, Yu was able to convince them to give him a ride to the nearby town of Aberdeen. After reaching Aberdeen and being rejected by a convenience store when he tried to pay using his ID and memorized credit card number, Yu directed the group to a Papa John's Pizza's location and ordered pizzas and other food, knowing he could pay with his ID and without an actual physical credit card, as he had done in the past at other Papa John‚Äôs restaurants. Yu returned to his classmates with the food. Though they destroyed the evidence of the pizzas, Yu was later found with the receipt during the resistance phase of the school during a strip search that was part of the training. Yu was initially forced out of the U.S. Army Special Forces Qualification Course, despite only being short one day of graduation, but was later able to repeat the class and receive his Green Beret. While some saw the incident as a typically creative Special Forces-type of solution to the SERE challenge, and his story is still reportedly told as a cautionary tale to incoming students to the SERE program by its cadre (albeit without Yu‚Äôs name and with the consequence of having been being forced out of the school). During his time in the U.S. Army, he also served in Iraq, the Philippines, and Okinawa. Due to the classified nature of his assignments there is little information about his deployments on public record. During his tours of duty, Yu conducted hostage rescue missions in Baghdad and coordinated 5,000 Filipino marines and soldiers in an attack on an Abu Sayyaf base. Yu served 8 years in the military (4 years additionally at West Point) and was awarded with two Bronze Stars and was discharged with rank of captain, although he was selected for early promotion to major. The Chang An-wei incident While on vacation, Taiwanese citizen Chang An-Wei was abducted by Abu Sayyaf gunmen on the Malaysian island of Pom Pom and was taken to the Philippines on November 15, 2013. Her husband, Hsu Li-Min, was killed. While visiting Taiwan to promote the Chinese language edition of Yellow Green Beret, Yu learned about the kidnapping. He described his relationship with Chang as \\"a family friend.\\" On the request of the Chang family, Yu went to the Philippines and utilizing his contacts within the Filipino armed forces and through a network of private security contractors, he organized two task forces to find Chang. Though the Filipino armed forces attempted to stop their soldiers and marines from taking part in the operation, they continued to work with Yu. One of Yu‚Äôs former instructors from West Point and fellow Green Beret officer also introduced him to Filipino special operations officers. Yu's team also opened a line of communication to the militants with regards to their ransom demands. Initially, the Abu Sayyaf group that held Chang asked for millions of dollars, but their monetary demands fluctuated wildly throughout their discussions. Ten days before Chang regained her freedom, Yu posed as a Chinese-speaking doctor during a phone call to the militants. The militants abruptly cut negotiations with the suspicion that Yu was a Taiwanese spy and threatened to kill Evelyn Chang, but two days later, Yu‚Äôs team was able to re- open communications under the guise of being a different group of negotiators. Chang was sold to various subgroups within the Abu Sayyaf organization, complicating the efforts to find her and the ongoing negotiations. Following the conversation Yu had with Chang, he and his team became concerned that she would be moved further up the Abu Sayyaf organization and that action on their part was required. The Filipino members of his team received orders from their chain of command to not get involved. The orders were ignored. Yu mentioned the groups made up of Filipinos and security contractors were at odds, and he had his doubts whether their actions would be a success. Despite their differences, the groups were able to locate Chang in an Abu Sayyaf jungle base camp in the Southern Philippine island province of Sulu. Yu declines to discuss what followed, but it resulted in a number of Abu Sayyaf members killed. Chang returned to Taiwan on December 21, 35 days after her ordeal began. Yu petitioned the Taiwanese government to award its Medal of Valor to three Filipino soldiers. All three were awarded with the medals and was the first time they were presented to foreign soldiers. Parallels to the Chang An- wei incident were made to the later kidnapping in April 2014 of Chinese national Gao Huayun and Filipino hotel staffer Marcy Dayawan. Yu was interviewed by the South China Morning Post for his thoughts on the event and how it compared to the Chang An-wei incident. Civilian career After leaving the military, Yu has worked as an equity swaps trader at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong in its Prime Services Department and with Palantir Technologies in its Asia-region business development department, based in Singapore. Yu also worked as Director of Channels at Perx, loyalty-based mobile CRM platform with an automated and targeted marketing messaging system based in Singapore, chaired by Eduardo Saverin, and as Vice President of Corporate Development at migme Limited, a Foxconn-backed social entertainment platform and public company on the Australian Stock Exchange. He also launched a mixed martial arts apparel company which creates fight gear, jiujitsu gi, and other apparel, FLOW MMA. Yu founded the company after training in mixed martial arts in Asia and discovering, while in Taiwan, that there were no MMA apparel companies that catered to Chinese fighters and enthusiasts. Yu has also served as a referee during Legend FC 8 and 10. Yu partnered with Barron Lau, former CEO of Round5 (the licensee of official UFC and Bruce Lee action figurines) and Carol Chen, an apparel manufacturer for developing designs based in Chinese culture. Former UFC and ONE FC fighter Andy Wang was also recruited to help cultivate MMA fighters in China. Yu is currently the CEO of Blackpanda, Asia's first combined physical-cyber incident response group, specializing in coverage of Asia-Pacific and hyper-focused on digital forensics and cyber crisis response and management; Resorts World Manila notably contracted the company to review its security procedures following the 2017 Resorts World Manila attack.

Although he never threatened to repay his auction price, he was a useful racehorse, winning the Listed Prix de Suresnes as a three-year-old and finishing placed in several Group races. Background Lichine was a \\"smallish, wiry\\" bay horse bred in Maryland by Mrs. J. Getty & Carelaine Stables. He was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Lyphard, an American-bred stallion who raced in France, winning the Prix Jacques Le Marois and Prix de la For√™t in 1972. Lyphard went on to become a very successful breeding stallion in both Europe and North America, siring Three Troikas, Dancing Brave and Manila. His dam, Stylish Genie was a minor stakes winner and a half-sister to Artaius, a Kentucky-bred colt who won the Eclipse Stakes and the Sussex Stakes in 1977. In 1981, the yearling was consigned to the Keeneland Sales where he was bought for a then world-record price of $1.7 million by the bloodstock agents BBA England, representing the Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos. The colt was sent to France where he was trained by Fran√ßois Boutin. Racing career Unraced as a two-year-old, Lichine began his racing career in the spring of 1982 by winning a maiden race at √âvry and the Listed Prix de Suresnes over 2200 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in May. He was beaten in his five remaining races that year but ran well to finish third in the Prix Daphnis, fifth in the Prix du Moulin and fourth in the Prix du Rond Point. Lichine stayed in training as a four-year- old and ran eight times, recording his only success in a race over 1850 metres at Longchamp in May. He again ran well in defeat on several occasions: he finished third in the Prix de Ris-Orangis, third in the Prix du Muguet, fourth in the Prix du Chemin de Fer du Nord and fourth in the Prix de la For√™t. Stud record Lichine was retired from racing to stand at the Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard in Normandy at an initial fee of ‚Ç£25,000. He later stood as a breeding stallion in Spain.

The website was originally launched in 2010 by a private owner and was soon acquired by Yellow Pages Directory Inc. In addition to telephone and street address listings, the website also has informational blog articles, in addition to being outspoken advocates of opting-out of traditional print telephone directory home delivery.

It opened in 1952 as a youth club and occasional disco. It then developed during the East German era into a live music venue where many notable German bands played regularly. Gentrification of the surrounding area in the late 2000s led to complaints about the club's noise from residents of newly constructed apartment buildings nearby. A court case resulted, placing restrictions on the noise levels, which the owners judged made the club financially untenable, resulting in its closure on 31 December 2010.Kult-Club \\"Icon\\" gibt auf ‚Äì Aus am Jahresende, Berliner Morgenpost, 3 December 2011 After efforts to reopen in another district, the club secured new premises in Prenzlauer Berg and announced in February 2013 that they planned to reopen in 2016. Delays due to construction permits pushed these plans back to 2018. History The club was located on Greifswalder Stra√üe in East BerlinDer legend√§re Knaack-Klub kommt zur√ºck, Berliner Morgenpost, 15 February 2013 on the site of a former brewery.Clubbed to death: Berlin steps in to save nightlife from gentrification, The Guardian, 29 March 2012 It began in 1952 as the Ernst Knaack youth centre () and featured table tennis and occasional concerts. It was named after Ernst Knaack, a local communist resistance fighter. It began to include music and dancing in the late 1960s and 1970s.Knaack Club: Der Countdown l√§uft, BZ Berlin, 3 December 2010 After years of playing mostly recorded music, the ground floor became a concert venue in 1992 and eventually hosted around 100 concerts a year.Tanz ins Ungewisse, Der Tagesspiegel, 21 October 2009 Among the bands who regularly played live at the venue were German groups such as Rammstein, who played one of their first concerts at the venue,Knaack-Club geht mit 59 in Rente, Der Tagesspiegel, 6 December 2010 and Die Toten Hosen. International artists such as Snow PatrolSnow Patrol interview , Soundmag, 30 May 2004, accessed 14 June 2014 and Keane also appeared at the venue.Keane interview , Soundmag, 15 April 2004, accessed 14 June 2014 =Closure= In the late 2000s, the district‚Äîduring the time of the GDR and into the 1990s an area favored by punks and bohemians‚Äîunderwent gentrification. Construction of new dwellings near the club resulted in complaints about the club's noise from the new residents.Famous Night Clubs Dying Out: Berlin's Reputation as a Party Town Under Threat, Spiegel Online, 28 March 2012, accessed 11 June 2014 This led to a temporary halt to concerts, which resulted in the number of clubbers falling from 1000 to 400 on a Saturday, threatening the club's economic viability. The planners of the apartment block were blamed for this, as they had failed to take the noise levels from the club into account when designing the apartment block.Das Knaack kehrt zur√ºck, Berliner Zeitung, 14 February 2013 Nevertheless, in June 2010 a court ruled in the residents' favour, instructing the club to finish all events by 23:00 and restricting it to noise levels which would register at no higher than 25 decibels in the living rooms of the residents after that time.Knaack Klub schlie√üt zum Jahresende, Der Tagesspiegel, 22 November 2010 The club responded by installing new soundproofing in the building to reduce the noise levels, but the reduced noise levels inside the club proved unpopular with clubbers. Eventually, the owners decided that these new conditions made operating a club untenable and decided to close, seeking a new location. The last concert took place on 4 December 2010, with a band from Munich, From Constant Visions, and one from Berlin, Contravolta, the last acts to play at the venue. The owners subsequently made an unsuccessful attempt to reopen the venue in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin. The closure of Knaack and similar clubs as a result of economic changes resulted in a new term being coined in Berlin: clubsterben or \\"club death.\\" Local politicians, concerned by possible economic effects of this, created a 1 million euro music fund to assist clubs in similar situations. =Reopening= In February 2013, the club announced that it had secured new premises on vacant land on Eberswalder Stra√üe in the Prenzlauer Berg district near Mauerpark. Press reports at that time suggested it would reopen in 2016 as Knaack-Kulturhaus.Knaack unter freiem Himmel, Berliner Zeitung, 14 August 2013 The club celebrated its future rebirth with a two-day festival in August 2013. The importance of Mauerpark to public utility companies meant that these plans were postponed, with the club planning to reopen in 2018.Legend√§rer Knaack Klub k√∂nnte 2018 wieder er√∂ffnen, Berliner Zeitung, 13 January 2017 Plans for this venue include a concert hall with a capacity of 1,000 people, a club with a capacity for 200, as well as rehearsal rooms, restaurant, cinema and music library.

During World War II, Harman achieved particular distinction for his service in the U.S. Army Air Forces. He piloted the first mission by a U.S. military helicopter in a combat zone in 1944. In 1945, the U.S. Army awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross for these efforts. Harman later rendered service to the music industry over a career spanning the 1940s through the 1980s. In 1981, BMI awarded him their Commendation of Excellence, and the American Composers Alliance awarded him their Laurel Leaf Award. Early life and education Harman was born in the New York City Borough of Brooklyn on June 4, 1918. He began musical studies at age nine by learning how to play the clarinet. After graduating from the Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey, Harman received his bachelor's degree with high honors from Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. During his time at Princeton, he studied under composer Roger Sessions, who won two Pulitzer prizes during his career. Harman served as music editor of the Nassau Lit, the college literary magazine at Princeton. He also participated in the choir and band. Following his service in the U.S. military during World War II, Harman completed his master's degree at Columbia University in Manhattan in 1949. He studied under Otto Luening, a German-American pioneer of tape music and electronic music. Military career Before World War II, Harman flew Piper airplanes and Waco aircraft. In 1943, he completed air force training in class 43-C of an Army Air Corps training program in Texas. Harman then served as a flight instructor for primary training. He later joined the first class of helicopter pilots (five in total) of the U.S. Army Air Services. The group trained at Sikorsky Aircraft's headquarters in Stratford, Connecticut to learn to pilot the YR-4B, an early military helicopter. (The R stood for rotary aircraft.) The YR-4B carried no onboard weapons. It featured a cruising speed of 65 miles per hour and a range of 130 miles. On April 21, 1944, the Japanese Imperial Army in Burma shot down a Stinson L-1 Vigilant rescue aircraft piloted by American Murphy Hladovack, which carried three wounded British soldiers. After a Stinson L-5 Sentinel aircraft spotted the group, the 1st Air Commando Group tasked Harman with rescuing them. His YR-4B was the only working helicopter among the four used by the group. The limited range of the YR-4B and small size of its cabin constrained how Harman managed the rescue operation. Harman had to transport the soldiers one by one to a liaison L-5 plane waiting at a designated sandbar and without the aid of weaponry. Over the span of two days, he ferried the soldiers to this plane to bring them to safety. The book Chopper: Firsthand Accounts of Helicopter Warfare, World War II to Iraq chronicles Harman's account of this first mission by a military helicopter. Writing and music industry career Following World War II, Harman resumed his a career as a music critic, which spanned two decades. He wrote articles for The New York Times (1947‚Äì1952) and Time Magazine (1952-1957). Harman also composed a ballet titled \\"Blackface\\", an opera titled \\"The Food of Love\\", and several children's songs. Recorded by Broadway star Mary Martin, his children's songs were released as the album Mary Martin Sings for Children. Starting in the 1950s and continuing into the 1960s, Harman worked as a music critic in Puerto Rico. In 1956 he began his career as a record producer, working with Emory Cook, founder of Cook Records. In 1967, Harman joined Composer Recordings, Inc. (CRI), a producer of contemporary classical music (now part of New World Records), as their executive vice president. He later served as the company's executive director from 1976 to 1981. During his music industry and writing career, Harman served as the sound recorder for the 1963 film Lord of the Flies. Directed by Peter Brook and produced by Lewis M. Allen, the film represented a British adaptation of William Golding's 1954 novel with the same name. Harman also authored three books. His first book discussed music history up through the Jazz Age.

They are popular in both training and competitions because the shooter gets instant acoustic feedback on a successful impact, and can often also visually confirm hits by seeing the bullet getting pulverized, leaving a mark on the surface paint, or moving/knocking down the target. Hanging steel plates (colloquially called \\"gongs\\") or self-resetting steel targets also have the advantage that the shooter do not need to go forward downrange to tape the targets, making it a good option for shooting ranges that otherwise have electronic targets. Steel targets also are weatherproof, contrary to paper targets, which do not hold up in rain and wind gusts. Precautions regarding ricochets If correct precautions are taken, the chance of ricochets when shooting at steel targets are minimal. The materials of which both the target and bullets are constructed should be chosen to cause the bullets to pulverize on impact, and therefore hardened steel targets and regular lead core bullets or copper jacketed bullets should be used. Unhardened steel should be avoided for use in targets, and ammunition with armor-piercing properties (i.e. steel cores) should also be avoided. Furthermore, it is important always to shoot steel targets at an angle in both vertical and horizontal direction so any ricochet immediately strikes the ground away from the shooter. This angling of the target also reduces distortion of the steel target and prolongs its lifetime. Localized heating, causing loss of hardness, is also reduced. Additionally, not mounting the targets solidly but allowing swinging or moving when shot reduces stress on impact. However, it has a downside in that shooters should only shoot at targets that are not moving to avoid accidentally reducing the angle of impact and thus possibly causing ricochets. =Target material= Steel targets made out of ordinary soft steel are quickly worn and are dangerous to use. As a safety precaution, steel targets must be made out of hardened steel, which is more resistant to plastic deformation than regular, soft steel. For steel targets, the steel should have a Brinell value of 500 or slightly more. One American producer of steel targets claims to use only steel with a hardness greater than 500, most often between 515‚Äì540. They also claim that the steel gets too brittle if higher Brinell values are used.Shooters Element Hardened steel is available in different Brinell values or thicknesses, and stainless variants are also available. A common trademark in the United States for hardened steel is AR500. Regular steel is too soft, resulting in bullets either punching through the target or making a crater whereupon subsequent bullets may bounce back toward the shooter or spectators, often with great force. Even thick plates quickly get holes and craters if they are made of regular steel (i.e. 10 mm or 3/8\\"). Processing of the steel target Many workshops have the tools to manufacture steel targets out of hardened steel, but it is important that it be done correctly. For instance, water jet cutters or laser cutters are preferred, but plasma cutters can be used. In contrast, angle grinders or normal welding damages the hardening. Hardened drill bits are also needed to cut holes in hardened steel targets. =Thickness and distance to the target= The required thickness of the target depends on the distance intended for shooting, steel quality, caliber, bullet type, and bullet speed. High velocity rounds more easily penetrate steel targets, meaning that faster bullets even of relatively small calibers or diameter are more likely to punch through a target. Manufacturers recommends at least 1/4\\" thickness (6.35 mm) with 500 Brinell value for pistol shooting with common calibres such as 9 mm, .40 S&W; and .45 ACP, with a safety distance of 10 yards (approx. 10 m). For rifle shooting, manufacturers recommend at least 3/8\\" (9.525 mm) 500 Brinell steel, and different distances according to what caliber is used. For calibers like .223 and .308 at least 100 yards are required for long target life. For larger and faster calibers such as 22-250, 30-06, 300 Win Mag or .338 Lapua 200 yards or farther is recommended. Nevertheless, the targets can often been shot at from much closer without any problems, provided proper angles are maintained. =Bullet choice= Lead core or frangible bullets are preferred, since they are pulverized upon high-velocity impact, and the dust will then be spread out to the sides of the target. However, bullets with hard cores (like steel, or \\"bi- metal\\") are not pulverized and can either penetrate or ricochet, causing them to be potentially dangerous. Since lead isn't magnetic, competition organizers may use a magnet to check for the presence of a ferromagnetic core. Copper jacketed bullets work fine with steel targets, provided that minimal distance guidelines are followed. Fixing Chains and shackles makes the most sound and is the most popular method for fixing hanging targets. Sections of old fire department hose is popular, for reasons of longevity. Ropes are quickly torn, but another alternative that lasts quite long are inner tubes of tires.Handgun Sports Competition use =Practical shooting= In practical shooting, administered by IPSC, both cardboard and steel targets are used. Standardized steel targets, called \\"poppers\\", are often used, but other forms and shapes can be used as long as they comply with the rules. The smallest sizes for respectively circular and square targets, both for rifle and pistols, are 15 cm √ò/ 15x15 cm, while the largest targets allowed for pistols are 30 cm √ò/ 30x30 cm and for rifles 30 cm √ò/ 45x30 cm.

File:Pepper Popper.pngPepper Popper, now obsolete. File:Mini Pepper Popper.pngMini Pepper Popper, now obsolete. = Biathlon = In biathlon, self-indicating steel targets are used that flip from black to white when hit, giving both the biathlete and spectators instant visual feedback for each shot fired. The target is placed at 50 meters, and has a diameter is 45 mm when shooting in the prone position, and 115 mm when shooting in the standing position. This translates to angular target sizes of about 1 and 2.5 mrad respectively.

Four years later she produced Storm Bird, the top- rated European two-year-old of 1980. The yearling was sent to the Keeneland Sales in July 1981 where he was sold for a then world-record price of $3.5 million by the bloodstock agency BBA (Ireland) on behalf of the British businessman Robert Sangster. The colt was sent to Europe where he was trained by Vincent O'Brien: he was named after O'Brien's training base at Ballydoyle, County Tipperary. Racing career After finishing unplaced on his racecourse debut he contested a one-mile maiden race at Leopardstown Racecourse in October. He went clear of his rivals a furlong from the finish but was caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by the Edward O'Grady-trained Putney Bridge. In November he started at odds of 2/5 for a six-furlong maiden at Naas Racecourse. He led from the start and won by three lengths from Glenhurst and eleven others. Stud record Ballydoyle was retired from racing and became a breeding stallion in California. He sired several minor winners but none of any importance. He died in 2000.

During World War II it fought in the Battle of France and The Blitz, and later served in India, where it was converted to Medium Artillery. Postwar it reverted to the AA artillery role. Origin Robert Whittaker, City banker and CO of 53rd (CoL) HAA Rgt; later chief of staff to AA Command German air raids by Zeppelin airships and Gotha bombers on London and other British cities during World War I had shown the need for strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the Territorial Army (TA) was reformed in 1922 it included a number of dedicated AA units. The third of these was 53rd (City of London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, recruited largely from men working in the finance industry in the City of London. It was formed in the Royal Field Artillery (RFA), but on 8 February 1923 it was transferred to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA), which had provided the AA batteries in World War I. However, on 1 June 1924 the RGA and RFA merged to become simply the Royal Artillery (RA). The regiment comprised 157th, 158th and 159th (London) AA Batteries. 159th Battery was recruited from the Lloyd's of London insurance market and in August 1924 it added the subtitle 'Lloyd's' in front of 'London'; in February 1925 all the batteries' subtitles changed from 'London' to 'City of London'.Frederick, pp. 754‚Äì5, 768.Litchfield, p. 164. One of the first officers appointed to the regiment was Robert Whittaker, a City banker who had seen service with the RGA during World War I. He was commissioned as a major and commanded 158th (CoL) Battery, and later the whole regiment,Monthly Army List 1923-39. The Regimental Headquarters was at the War Office Department in White City, London. The unit formed part of 27th (London) Air Defence Brigade. War Office, 'Titles and Designations' 1927. These original TA AA units were formed on a low peacetime establishment with a few old 3-inch guns on static mounts.Routledge, p. 40. As Britain's AA defences expanded during the 1930s, higher formations became necessary. 1st AA Division was formed in 1935 to cover London and the Home Counties, and the 53rd AA Brigade was reassigned to 26th (London) AA Group within the division. Lieutenant- Colonel Whittaker was promoted to command this brigade in early 1939. On 1 January 1939 the RA replaced its traditional unit designation 'Brigade' by the modern 'Regiment'. Anti-Aircraft Command was formed in April 1939 to command all TA air defences in the UK. As part of the doubling of the strength of the TA after the Munich Crisis, 53 AA Regiment formed a duplicate regiment in 1939 at White City, which was designated 88 AA Regiment.Frederick, p. 777.Litchfield, p. 166. World War II =Mobilisation= The regiment was embodied on 5 August 1939 and occupied gun positions in parks and open ground around London: 157 Bty at Southwark Park and Brockley in south-east London and at Gunnersbury Park and Hurlingham Park in west London; 158 Bty at Hyde Park and Wormwood Scrubs, with its HQ at Fairlop and also occupying various sites in Essex east of London; 159 Bty with HQ at Finsbury Park and sites at Friern Barnet in north London. In early September, elements of 88 AA Regiment took over 157 Bty's positions and the battery moved to Bramley, Surrey where it came under 5 AA Division. Thus the regiment was fully deployed when war was declared on 3 September.53 HAA Regt War Diary 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives, Kew (TNA) file WO 167/617. The regiment manned static gun sites designated as Heavy AA (HAA) containing both the older 3-inch and newer 3.7-inch AA guns. They were moved frequently: by the end of September 1939, 157 Bty was stationed around Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, 158 at Enfield and Edmonton in Middlesex, and 159 at Cuffley, Hertfordshire, with Regimental HQ at Bush Hill Park. =France= On 7 October 1939 the regiment received orders to proceed overseas. The regiment had to be brought up to war establishment and equipped with mobile equipment, albeit on a reduced scale because of shortages and the semi-static role envisaged for HAA units. It landed at Cherbourg on 16 October equipped with 3-inch guns and joined the Royal Air Force's Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) at Reims in France. It formed part of 12 AA Bde, tasked with defending the AASF's airfields.Routledge, pp. 114‚Äì5, 373, Tables XVII & XVIII, pp. 125‚Äì6. 53 HAA was responsible for the northern group of airfields; 157 Battery manned sites codenamed PIP I and PIP II around Villers-Marmery, 158 manned SQUEAK I and SQUEAK II around Guignecourt, and 159 manned WILFRED I and WILFRED II around Cernay-l√®s-Reims; RHQ was codenamed PIXO.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 19. (Pip, Squeak and Wilfred were characters in a popular newspaper strip cartoon.) 3.7-inch anti-aircraft gun attached to the AASF (Advanced Air Striking Force) near Rheims for airfield defence, 23 March 1940. The regiment remained in its positions throughout the Phoney War, expanding some of its 2-gun sites to 4 guns, building new 2-gun sites, and paying particular attention to Camouflage. In April 1940, a detachment of 3rd Searchlight Regiment RA was attached to SQUEAK II to evaluate RDF (early Radar) sets. 7 Searchlight Battery of 2nd Searchlight Regiment RA, with 24 searchlights and 24 Bren guns, and 162 Battery of 54 (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light AA Regiment were distributed near to 53's sites for close defence. On 10 May 1940, the Germans began their attack on France and the Low Countries with heavy bombing raids on airfields. Over succeeding days 53 Regiment's AA and Bren guns frequently engaged enemy aircraft ‚Äì it claimed 8‚Äì10 shot down in six days ‚Äì although some of their positions were machine- gunned from the air and 158 Bty's HQ was bombed. By 14 May it was clear that the AASF would have to move back to airfields deeper in France. This was difficult for the heavy AA because of the shortage of towing vehicles, and 53 AA Rgt had to leave behind 16 of its 24 guns. The regiment reached the Troyes area on the River Seine on 16 May and immediately sent parties back to recover the abandoned equipment ‚Äì one such group being captured by the advancing Germans ‚Äì and succeeded in retrieving all but six of its guns.Routledge, p. 119.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 20. As the situation deteriorated, 53 AA Rgt was split up on 21 May: numerous personnel, guns and transport were transferred from 157 and 159 Btys to 158 Bty and other units of 12 AA Bde to bring them up to strength, while the remainder moved to Nantes in the Loire region to help guard a new base. 157 and 159 Btys, each with seven guns, and 7 S/L Bty (without searchlights), occupied positions on either side of the River Loire. By 4 June, while the bulk of the British Expeditionary Force had been evacuated from Dunkirk, the troops on the Loire were still in position. On 6 June, 53 AA Rgt learned that it was to move 630 miles to southern France. The advance party reached Salon-de-Provence, near Marseille on 9 June, joining HADDOCK FORCE, whose airfields were to support bombing raids by RAF Wellingtons against Italian targets. Together with the Bofors guns of No 2 Troop, 162 Bty, of 54 LAA, the regiment's 13 remaining 3-inch guns provided the AA defence for HADDOCK FORCE. 158 Bty was evacuated with 12 AA Bde from St. Nazaire, and a party was on board HMT Lancastria when she was sunk with heavy loss of life on 17 June.Routledge, p. 123. By 17 June it was clear that France was about to surrender, and plans were made to evacuate HADDOCK FORCE by sea from Marseille. The AA detachments under command of 53 Regt were assigned to the SS Alma Dawson. A French dockyard strike prevented them from loading any of the 3-inch guns or vehicles, but the Bofors guns were mounted on the ship's decks. The ship put to sea on 18 June and slowly made its way to Gibraltar, where the AA gunners disembarked and temporarily reinforced the garrison. On 27 June, 82 HAA Regiment arrived on the SS City of Cairo, and once they had been unloaded with their guns and equipment, 53 AA Rgt boarded the ship and sailed in convoy for the UK on 2 July.53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940‚Äì41, TNA file WO 166/2343.Routledge, pp. 123 & 201. =Home Forces= 53 HAA disembarked at Liverpool on 12 July and the men entrained for London, where the regiment came under the command of 49 AA Bde. Since 1 June, along with other AA units equipped with 3-inch or 3.7-inch guns, the 53rd had been formally designated a Heavy AA Regiment. By 22 July, 157 Bty was manning static HAA gun sites in Dulwich and Woolwich under the command of 54 (City of London) HAA Regiment and 97 (London Scottish) HAA Regiment, while 159 Bty took over sites round Slough and Windsor. After various changes in location and command during the summer of 1940, the regiment moved to Rainham, Kent and joined 28 (Thames and Medway) AA Bde at the beginning of October, during the early stages of the London Blitz. In September 1940, Lt-Col Vere Krohn, who had commanded 53 HAA since before the outbreak of war, left the regiment for an appointment at AA Command, where he later headed the technical staff.London Gazette 29 July 1930.Sir Frederick Pile's despatch, 'The Anti-Aircraft Defence of the United Kingdom', London Gazette 18 December 1947. In the autumn, the regiment was re-equipped with 3-inch guns and sent to the live firing range at Aberporth for retraining.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 98.Routledge, p. 374. In February 1941, RHQ moved to Croydon and came under 48 AA Bde. 53 HAA was now designated as a mobile AA unit and had its own Royal Corps of Signals section and Royal Army Service Corps section with additional vehicles.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. In October 1941 the regiment was posted to Dover (where it experienced occasional German shelling) but at the end of the month prepared for deployment overseas once more. =Far East= On 1 May 1942, the regiment disembarked at Bombay in India with 24 static 3.7-inch guns. On 19 May it moved to Calcutta, (leaving 159 Bty behind at Bombay) and came under the command of 1st Indian AA Bde. 159 Battery later moved to Ceylon, where it joined 52 (London) HAA Regiment and took part in the Burma Campaign 1944‚Äì45.Joslen, p. 519.Farndale, Far East, p. 357. The Imperial Japanese Army Air Service began raiding Calcutta during the winter of 1942‚Äì43 and 53 HAA Regiment was involved in the defence of the city. On the night of 15 January 1943 the regiment did not engage the attackers, but observed as three were shot down by a Beaufighter night fighter piloted by Flight-Sergeant Maurice Pring.53 HAA Regt War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 172/2339. In January 1943, the regiment was joined by 154 (London) Battery from 52 HAA Regiment in exchange for 159 Bty. It also commanded 202 Bty detached from 56 (Cornwall) HAA Regiment. 53 Regiment re-converted to the mobile HAA role and came under the command of 2nd Indian AA Bde, remaining at Calcutta until May 1944, when it moved to Nira under 9 AA Bde at Poona.Farndale, Far East, p. 346.Routledge, Tables XXXVII, pp. 252‚Äì3 and XXXIX, p. 254.53 HAA Regt War Diary May‚ÄìJuly 1944, TNA file WO 172/4692. In July 1944 the regiment underwent a major reorganisation, converting to the medium artillery role at Poona. Initially designated 'A' Medium Regiment, it became 85th (City of London) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery on 24 August, with 157 and 158 Medium Batteries, while 202 Bty returned to 56 HAA, which became 'B' Medium Regiment (later 86 Medium Regiment) and 154 Battery moved to 'C' Medium Regiment (later 87 Medium Regiment).Frederick, pp. 723, 740.Joslen, p. 512.Farndale, Far East, p. 364.British Artillery in World War 285 Med Regt War Diary August‚ÄìDecember 1944, TNA file WO 172/4742. In September, 85 Medium Regiment moved to Secunderabad while remaining under the command of 9 AA Bde, then in December it moved to Ranchi and came under the command of RA Training HQ No 40. Here it began training with new equipment, at first the 25-pounder field gun, then the obsolescent 6-inch howitzer in 'Bunker-buster' mode, and finally the 5.5-inch medium gun.85 Med Regt War Diary January‚ÄìDecember 1945, TNA file WO 172/7483. Having fully trained on its new equipment, 85 Medium Regiment joined 59th Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) on 18 May 1945 with which it remained until the end of the war.59 AGRA War Diary February‚ÄìDecember 1945, TNA file WO 172/7515. In July 1945, 85 Med Regt formed an additional 'R' Battery from personnel who were not due for early demobilisation, and others transferred from 69 LAA Regiment which was returning to the UK. When the war ended, 59 AGRA was undergoing intensive training and waterproofing its vehicles for participation in Operation Zipper, a proposed landing by XXXIV Corps to liberate Malaya. The regiment and its batteries were placed in suspended animation on 1 March 1946 Postwar The regiment was reconstituted in the TA on 1 January 1947 as 453rd (London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery at Shepherd's Bush. In 1950 it amalgamated with 488 HAA Regt (the successor of its duplicate 88 HAA Regiment formed at White City in 1939) as 453rd/488th Heavy Anti- Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (City of London) ‚Äì the only TA artillery regiment to have two numbers in its title.Frederick, p. 1015.444‚Äì473 Regiments at British Army 1945 on. When AA Command was disbanded in 1955 the regiment underwent a further amalgamation with three other London HAA regiments: 452 (London), 454 (City of London) and 497 (Hammersmith) to form 452 (London) HAA: * RHQ Battery ‚Äì from 453/488 HAA * P (Middlesex) Battery ‚Äì from 452 HAA * Q (Lloyd's City of London Battery) ‚Äì from 454 HAA * R (Hammersmith) Battery ‚Äì from 497 HAA In 1961 the regiment amalgamated again with 264 (7th London) and 290 (City of London) Field Regiments and 353 (London) Medium Regiment to form 254 (City of London) Field Regiment, including Q (53rd London) Battery. When the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967 the merged regiment was reduced to a single battery and the 53rd Anti-Aircraft lineage ended.Litchfield, p. 150. Badge The regiment adopted a collar badge of the brass RA grenade with the City of London arms on the ball and a pair of silver wings sprouting from the shoulders of the grenade. Instead of the RA motto UBIQUE, the scroll underneath the grenade was inscribed '53 (CoL) A.A. Bde RA'. This badge was also worn on the side of steel helmets and painted on vehicles during WWII.

History Community Solutions was created by a team within Common Ground, a non-profit housing organization, also founded by Haggerty. While at Common Ground, Haggerty noticed that even though more supportive housing was being constructed and there was more funding for shelters and other relief programs, homelessness continued to increase. Common Ground launched the national 100,000 Homes Campaign in July 2010. It worked with 238 communities to find and house 100,000 of the most vulnerable and chronically homeless individuals by July 2014. On June 11, 2014, the Campaign announced they had housed the 100,000th individual.100,000 Homes website The campaign used online problem-solving infrastructure and in-person training and coaching to help communities improve their housing placement systems. The local community leads identified all of their homeless neighbors by name, tracked and measured their local housing placement progress, and adopted process improvements and evidence-based best practices to improve their ability to house homeless people more efficiently.Bornstein, David. \\"The Push to End Chronic Homelessness Is Working\\" (Op-Ed) New York Times (May 24, 2014) The team became a separate nonprofit known as Community Solutions in 2011 to look not just at ending homelessness, but at solving the problems that can lead to homelessness. While the 100,000 Homes Campaign surpassed its goal, the team found that none of the participating communities managed to end homelessness. As a result, Community Solutions launched Built for Zero in 2015, to help communities measurably end chronic and veteran homelessness. Initiatives The Built for Zero initiative is a methodology and movement of over 80 communities using real- time person-specific data, collaboration, and a community-wide commitment to end veteran and chronic homelessness. Communities aim to reach and sustain a standard called Functional Zero, which states fewer people are experiencing homelessness than a community can routinely house in permanent housing in a single month. In the New York City neighborhood of Brownsville, Brooklyn, where a handful of major indicators for poverty are found, the Brownsville Partnership works to create solutions to the neighborhood's most pressing challenges. The Partnership comprises more than 30 partner organizations, and it draws on the intense engagement of community members and local stakeholders. The Brownsville Partnership is launching the 5,000 Jobs Campaign in August 2014 to connect 5,000 Brownsville residents to jobs by December 2017. The Northeast Neighborhood Partnership works in Hartford, Connecticut to improve the health and economic security of the neighborhood. The partnership is working with the community to revitalize the M. Swift and Sons gold leafing factory into a health and employment hub. Recognitions and awards Community Solutions's 100,000 Homes Campaign won the 2013 World Habitat Award.

He proved to be just short of top class in a brief racing career, winning the Royal Whip Stakes and finishing second in the Irish St Leger. He made little impact as a breeding stallion. Background Empire Glory was a bay or brown horse bred in Kentucky by Mortin Levy & Myron Rosenthal's Glencoe Farm. His dam Spearfish had won the Hollywood Oaks in 1966 and had produced the leading North American racehorse King's Bishop and the Irish 1000 Guineas winner Gaily. Through Gaily, she was also the ancestor of Pilsudski. Empire Glory was sired by the Triple Crown winner Nijinsky. In 1982 he was consigned by Glencoe Farm to the Keeneland Sales where he was sold for a record-setting $4.25 million ($ million inflation adjusted) to the bloodstock agents BBA (Ireland) on behalf of the British businessman Robert Sangster after a prolonged bidding battle with representatives of Sheikh Mohammed. The colt was sent to Europe and was trained by Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Racing career Empire Glory raced only as a three-year-old in the 1984 season. After refusing to enter the starting stalls on his first racecourse appearance he finished second in his first completed race and then won a maiden race at Leopardstown by six lengths.

Ciaccia served as a member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1973 to 1998, representing the Mount Royal riding for the Quebec Liberal Party. He occupied various posts in the cabinets of Liberal premiers Robert Bourassa, and Daniel Johnson Jr., such as minister of Energy and Natural Resources, International Affairs, Native Affairs, and Immigration and Cultural Communities. At his resignation, Ciaccia was the longest-serving member of the Assembly. Ciaccia gained international attention for his efforts in negotiating the end of the Oka Crisis alongside his federal counterpart, Tom Siddon, in 1990. Former Quebec Premier Jean Charest described Ciaccia's political career as having \\"revolutionized relations with the native people and cultural communities of Quebec by always favouring an approach marked by respect.\\"Ciaccia stepping down: [Final Edition] Elizabeth Thompson And Eileen Travers. The Gazette [Montreal, Que] 16 Sep 1998: A1  Early life  John Ciaccia was born Giambattista Nicola Ciaccia in the Italian town of Jelsi in the region of Molise on March 4, 1933. He emigrated to Canada via Ellis Island in 1937 with his mother and elder sister reuniting with their father, who had already come to Montreal in 1935. Ciaccia recalled the trials of growing up in another country, being viewed by some as an outsider. This was compounded during the years of the Second World War, as his native Italy fought Canada and the Allies. Ciaccia became fluent in both English and French at an early age, reading novels and encyclopedias in both languages as a child. Ciaccia attributes his academic success in part to the encouragement of his mother, with whom he kept a close relationship until her death in 1990. Ciaccia attended the English-speaking, Catholic, D'Arcy McGee High School. Ciaccia received his BA from McGill University in 1953. He then pursued his studies at McGill's prestigious Faculty of Law, whose faculty, at the time, consisted of future Supreme Court and Superior Court justices. As a law student, Ciaccia became managing editor of the McGill Law Journal where he published an analysis, \\"Perron v. School Trustees of the School Municipality of Rouyn: Case and Comment\\". He received his law degree in 1956 and was admitted to the Quebec Bar in 1957; he began practising for the Montreal-based firm, Malouf & Shorteno. In 1959, Ciaccia began working for the legal department of the now- defunct Steinberg's grocery chain‚Äî-at the time, one of the largest in Quebec. Ciaccia would eventually become the chain's director of real estate. Throughout the 1960s he continued to practice law. While still practising law, he acted as a consultant for the Canadian department of Indian Affairs. In 1971, he was offered a position in the federal civil service, as assistant deputy minister of Indian affairs and northern development, headed at the time by future prime minister Jean Chr√©tien. Initially reluctant, Ciaccia's decision to quit practising law and accept the position was cemented by a case he had recently handled: where a \\"remorseless\\" client of his negotiating terms of a contract that would prove ruinous for the already financially strained other party. Ciaccia was later told by a colleague the soon to be bankrupt man left his clients' office in tears. This led Ciaccia to, \\"leave a thriving law practice in Montreal for a low-paying position in Ottawa to deal with the unresolved problems of mistreated peoples...\\" Civil service As assistant deputy minister, Ciaccia helped negotiate development projects on native territory, addressing the sensitive issue of land rights. This often involved face-to-face meetings across the country with members of aboriginal communities, including elders and chiefs. Ciaccia implemented the native youth liaison program which employed natives to help coordinate native youth programs throughout Canada. The program proved controversial. Militant elements of the native movement interpreted it as an attempt to usurp power from the chiefs. Bureaucrats at the Ministry, viewed the new program with apprehension as well. Ciaccia lashed out at both sides, denouncing both \\"power-hungry\\" Native politicians as well as \\"idiots in the Indian Affairs department who hate Indians.\\" His remarks caused a brief uproar, with one Conservative MP calling for his resignation. Indian Affairs minister, Jean Chr√©tien, defended Ciaccia, noting the difficult nature of his deputy's workload. In 1972, Ciaccia helped found the Indian Way School, in the Kahnawake Mohawk reserve south of Montreal. The school was established in response to concerns of natives that their children's culture was being assimilated at the (mostly white) Billings School in nearby Chateauguay. Days before Ciaccia officially resigned from the civil service to run in the 1973 Quebec general election, The Globe and Mail lauded Ciaccia for his initiatives that helped \\"decentralize Indian Affairs and give more power to Indians themselves.\\" 1973-1976: MNA under Bourassa =Entry into provincial politics= On September 25, 1973, Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa called a general election for October 29. Bourassa asked John Ciaccia to run in the newly formed electoral riding of Mont-Royal, a multicultural area of Montreal, regarded as a Liberal stronghold. Ciaccia accepted the offer, resigning from his Federal post in the department of Indian Affairs. Ciaccia was easily elected, with 83% of the vote and would go on to represent the riding for the next 25 years. =Negotiating James Bay Agreement= In the 1960s, the province of Quebec began developing potential hydroelectric resources in the sparsely populated North, inhabited mostly by various native groups, such as the Cree and Inuit. In 1971, the government of Premier Robert Bourassa created the James Bay Development Corporation to pursue the development of mining, forestry and other potential resources starting with the James Bay Hydroelectric Project. The proposed project faced fierce resistance from the native Cree and Inuit populations. By early 1973, he was touting it as \\"the key to economic and social progress in Quebec.\\" In September, a general election was called for October 29. Early in the campaign, Bourassa sought to make the issue a key pillar to the Liberal party platform, pledging to pursue the multibillion-dollar project if re-elected. In the immediate aftermath of the Liberal victory, it had been widely anticipated Ciaccia would be given a cabinet post in the new Bourassa government. However, on November 20, 1973, he was chosen as the premier's personal representative for negotiations with native groups affected by the proposed James Bay project. Ciaccia, considered a \\"specialist on native peoples\\", was tasked with finalizing a deal between Quebec and the natives. The project had gained a sense of urgency in recent days. The Quebec Superior Court had recently granted the Cree and Inuit a temporary injunction, essentially shutting down the project costing the government an estimated $500,000 a day. Elected as an MNA and subsequently chosen as the government's chief negotiator, John Ciaccia sought to find common ground. On December 21, 1973, the provincial government's position was strengthened when the Supreme Court ruled against the current injunction granted weeks earlier. In exchange for ending further legal obstruction to the project, Ciaccia initially offered affected native communities a reported $100 million in royalties along with increased hunting and fishing rights. In early February 1974, Cree and Inuit leaders officially refused the offer, stating that land concessions and recognition of native rights throughout Quebec‚Äînot money‚Äîwere the main sticking points. Ciaccia publicly suggested native leaders were overstating their peoples' genuine opposition to the project, offering to personally travel North to gauge the reaction himself. Ciaccia made good on his offer and in April 1974 visited the Cree Mistassini reservation in northern Quebec. He spent hours answering questions from hundreds of mostly hostile residents in a school auditorium. Negotiations continued throughout 1974 with an agreement in principle being reached in November. It would take another 12 months for the details to be finalized. In the early hours of November 12, 1975, Cree and Inuit leaders signed the landmark treaty which granted them a combined 60,000 square miles in land rights and $225 million over 20 years. The agreement was seen a precedent for similar land disputes in other provinces. James O'Reilly, one of the lawyers representing the native groups, praised Ciaccia's level-headed approach during negotiations, \\"playing it cool\\" in the face of emotionally charged discussions. =Opposition to Bill 22= In early 1974, it was reported the Bourassa Liberals were preparing legislation that would limit the ability of non-English speaking parents to send their children to English schools. However, as the 1974 National Assembly session begun, it became clearer that language of schooling was only part of a bolder proposal to establish French as the official language of Quebec: Bill 22. The proposed legislation was largely opposed by both Anglophones and immigrant communities, seen as the imposition of second class citizenship on non-Francophones. Ciaccia, one of nine Anglophone Liberal MNAs at the time, opposed the Bill, criticizing its discriminatory nature. By March 1974, Ciaccia along with four other Anglo MNAs announced their intention go against party lines and vote against the Bill. Ultimately, Ciaccia and George Springate were the only Liberal MNAs to vote against the Bill in its second reading when it reached its second reading in July 1974. Responding to criticism from within the party that two MNAs votoed against government, Premier Bourassa suspended both Springate and Ciaccia, barring them from Caucus meetings. Ciaccia nevertheless continued his role as chief government negotiator with the Cree and Inuit on the James Bay project. Bourassa would eventually welcome Ciaccia and Springate back into the caucus after less than 2 months. 1976-1985: Member of the Opposition On October 20, 1976, with the Liberals high in the polls and a divided opposition, Premier Robert Bourassa called an election for November 15. The Liberals however, ended up losing to a Patri Qu√©becois majority. John Ciaccia was one of 26 Liberals who managed to hold on to their seats. Over the next 9 years of separatist Parti Qu√©becois rule, Ciaccia was an eminent voice for both federalism and Quebec's non-francophones. During his years in the opposition, he occupied various shadow cabinet posts, acting as critic for native affairs, transport, housing, and industry and commerce Ciaccia was a vocal opponent of the Patri Quebecois' 1977 landmark Charter of the French Language, characterizing the legislation as one \\"that restricts our liberties and a vision which will result in the phasing out of the English [community in Quebec].\\" During the 1977-1978 Liberal leadership race (Bourassa having resigned after the 1976 election defeat) Ciaccia announced his support for Claude Ryan, a former publisher at Le Devoir. At a press conference alongside Ryan, Ciaccia highlighted Ryan's opposition to the controversial Bill 101. During the press conference, Ryan surprised many in the room, Ciaccia included, by speaking in Italian for the next 2 minutes, thanking the MNA for his support. Ciaccia's endorsement of Ryan was significant, as Ciaccia was considered a leading \\"spokesman for Quebec ethnic groups\\"‚Äîa traditional bastion of Liberal support. Ryan would go on to become Liberal leader. During the 1980 referendum campaign on Quebec independence from Canada, Ciaccia was an executive member of the \\"No\\" campaign committee, frequently attending and speaking at federalist rallies in the Montreal area. In the run-up to May 20 vote, Ciaccia raised concerns that voters in Montreal areas with significant immigrant populations (who mainly opposed succession from Canada) were being excluded from the list of electors. The \\"No\\" campaign would go on to win the referendum by a margin of 60% to 40%. In the 1981 general election, the Parti Quebecois was given a second majority mandate. John Ciaccia was able to easily retain his Mont-Royal seat with 81% percent of the vote. Claude Ryan was eventually forced out as Liberal leader in August 1982 and succeeded by Gerard Levesque in the interim, until a new leader would be chosen in October 1983. Ciaccia seriously considered running for the leadership, but ultimately decided not to run. It had been suggested by some, that regardless of his chances, Ciaccia should nevertheless run so that \\"non-francophones can aspire to lead [the] party.\\" However, when explaining his decision not to run Ciaccia specifically mentioned the possibility that his (mostly non-francophone) supporters would have felt alienated from the rest of the party. The Montreal Gazette editorial board attributed Ciaccia's decision to a \\"sad unwritten rule\\" that only francophones could aspire to high political office in Quebec. Ex-premier Robert Bourassa would go on win the party nomination and return as the party leader. 1985-1994: Cabinet minister =Minister of Energy and Natural Resources= In the 1985 general election Ciaccia once again retained his seat by a comfortable margin. The election marked the comeback of Premier Robert Bourassa whose Liberals won a commanding majority. Ciaccia, who had already served under Bourassa's first mandate, was promoted to a position in Liberal cabinet as Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, officially sworn in on December 12. As minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Ciaccia oversaw of the portfolios of two delegated cabinet ministers: Albert Cot√© (responsible for Forestry) and Raymond Savoie (in charge of both Mining and Native Affairs). As minister of energy, Ciaccia sought ensure Quebecers paid a price on fuel more in line with the national average. Soon after he became minister, a federal probe confirmed what many had already suspected: consumers in Quebec were paying up to an extra $500 million a year for imported gasoline due to insufficient refining domestic capacity. This would soon be exacerbated by plans to close an oil refinery in east end Montreal. Initially owned by Gulf Canada, the refinery was to be sold to British-owned Ultramar Canada which subsequently intended on closing it by year's end. Ciaccia urged his federal counterpart, Pat Carney, to block the sale. The Progressive Conservative federal government led by Brian Mulroney refused to block the sale. Ciaccia sought to find another buyer for the refinery that would keep it operational. Ultimately, Ciaccia managed to get Ultramar to sell part of the refinery specializing in petrochemicals (and not gasoline) to Montreal-based Lavelin Inc. The remainder of the refinery was dismantled, a decision strongly criticized by Ciaccia as short-sighted and detrimental to Quebec's future energy needs. In the months following the refinery's closure, gasoline prices increased throughout the province. Towards the end of 1986, Ciaccia grew increasingly frustrated with what he viewed as gouging of companies by the oil companies. In November, Ultramar raised the price of gasoline by 2 cents a litre, a move quickly followed by other distributors throughout the province. Ciaccia singled out the company for \\"taking advantage of Quebeckers.\\" In addition, high gas prices persisted in outlying regions despite a measure in the 1985 budget which lowered the gasoline surtax by 10 percent compared to the rest of the province. Ciaccia commissioned a 1987 report which concluded oil companies and gasoline distributors were pocketing most of the tax cuts on the retail price of gasoline in Quebec's outlying regions, failing to pass down the savings to consumers. The report estimated that over $20 million in tax cuts intended for consumers were being pocketed by oil companies, distributors, and retailers. In June 1987, Ciaccia issued a decree, valid for 3 months, controlling the price of gasoline, setting a ceiling on the price in outlying regions. Ciaccia later extended the decree in order to, \\"give him time to set up a body to help consumers benefit from fair prices.\\" In search of a more permanent solution, Ciaccia helped draft Bill 93, which was passed into law on November 12, 1987. The bill created an agency charged with monitoring gasoline prices throughout the province, while also reaffirming \\"the government's right to set gasoline prices\\" via cabinet decree. As minister of Energy and Natural Resources, John Ciaccia attempted to rejuvenate the struggling pulp and paper industry in the province. During his tenure, he helped launch and give subsidies to two paper mill projects : the reopening of an idle plant in Port-Cartier and the construction of a new one in Matane. Re- opening the mill in Port-Cartier would create over 400 jobs. The plant, closed by its previous owner, ITT Rayonier in 1979 was to be jointly owned by Quebec- based Cascades Inc and the state-owned Rexfor. The provincial government paid $102 million to reopen the plant compared to only $5 million by Cascades. The federal government refused to provide any funds or grants for Port Cartier. In April 1986, Ciaccia sent a proposal to the Norwegian company Saugbrugs Forenginen to set up a $327 million paper bill in the town of Matane. Saubrurgs showed interest in the proposal and responded to Ciaccia in June with a counter-offer The proposed project was hindered by the federal government's initial refusal to provide funding and in January 1987, Saubrurgs backed out of the project. Ciaccia accused the Mulroney Conservatives of stalling on the construction of the Matane mill in the economically depressed Gasp√©, a project they had endorsed during the previous federal election. The federal and provincial governments reached a joint funding agreement valued at over $25 million October 1987 in which Donohue Inc (of which Quebecor Inc held a majority stake) would build and operate the Matane plant. Construction for the $290 million plant in Matane (scaled-down in size from the $600 initially envisioned by Donahue) began in late 1988. The plant would employ 125 workers and generate an estimated 1600 jobs in spin-off industries. Both the Matane and Port-Cartier projects were highly contentious within the pulp and paper industry itself, which was already suffering from overcapacity throughout North America. B.K. Koken, president of Abitibi-Price Inc called Ciaccia's attempt to bring a plant to Matane \\"a disservice to the industry,\\" adding that public funds \\"should not be used to prolong uneconomic activities. =Language wars: Bill 178= In 1988, segments of the anglophone community began to complain that the Bourassa Liberals were once again taking their support for granted. In the run-up to the 24th Liberal general convention in February 1988, Alliance Quebec president Royal Orr criticized the party for ignoring the community's \\"legitimate concerns\\" risking a crisis within the party. Ciaccia, one of four anglophone cabinet ministers responded to criticism his party was ignoring English-speakers, saying, \\"Just because we're not waving the flag doesn't mean we're ignoring the community.\\" Commentators in the English media continued to criticize Ciaccia and other anglophone MNAs for not taking harder stands against what they viewed as attempts to marginalize the province's English speakers. Tensions grew in late March when both the PQ and Liberals (including all 21 Anglophone MNAs) backed a motion condemning the federal official language commissioner D'Iberville Fortier for stating that Quebec was \\"humiliating\\" its anglophone population. Ciaccia justified his support of the motion, arguing that \\"Fortier did us a disservice by talking about humiliation...This is not the time for inflammatory remarks...\\". Ciaccia said his riding office received insulting phone calls from English residents, angry over his decision. In December 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down a section of Bill 101 (implemented by the PQ in 1977) which forbade the use of languages other from French on business signs, on the grounds that it violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms' guarantee of the right of expression. The Quebec Liberals responded by tabling legislation, Bill 178, that would still prohibit other languages on outdoor business signs, but would permit bilingual signage indoors. In a sign of protest, the three other anglophone cabinet ministers, Clifford Lincoln, Herbert Marx, and Richard French, resigned from Bourassa's cabinet. Ciaccia, however, decided to stay, questioning any good that would come from his resigning, saying he could do more for anglophones by remaining in cabinet. Gazette columnist Don MacPherson, previously critical of Ciaccia, praised him for showing \\"heroism of a different kind in deciding to try to continue to defend minority interests within the cabinet... He is bound to face some harsh criticism for not having joined his colleagues in restoring the honor of the community. He knew that, which makes his decision a courageous one in its own way.\\" The Gazette editorial board, despite calling on all four cabinet ministers to resign nevertheless acknowledged Ciaccia's decision: \\"That is not to condemn the fourth anglophone minister, John Ciaccia, for choosing a different path...because he believes he can serve his community better from within cabinet.\\" In May 1989, with an election coming in the fall, Ciaccia addressed a hostile crowd at an Alliance Quebec convention. In the wake of the newly formed Equality Party, he urged association's members to continue supporting the Liberals, lest the party no longer feel obliged to answer the needs of anglophones in Quebec Ciaccia later told reporters that he \\"felt like Daniel in the Lion's den\\" at the convention. Despite the criticism from sections of the anglophone community, John Ciaccia comfortably retained his seat in the 1989 general election, defeating Equality candidate Nat Bernstein by 5,165 votes. =Minister of International Affairs and Minister of Native Affairs= Following the 1989 re-election of a Bourassa Liberal majority, Ciaccia remained a cabinet minister and was given two separate portfolios: International Relations and Native Affairs. Ciaccia already had experience with the Native community in the 1970s: first as a federal civil servant, then as chief provincial negotiator during James Bay Hydroelectric development. Meech Lake Accord John Ciaccia was a staunch supporter of the Meech Lake Accord, a package of proposed amendments to the Canadian Constitution, intended to persuade Quebec to sign on the Constitution Act of 1982. At the time of its initial negotiation in 1987, the Accord was supported by the premiers of all ten provinces along with the majority of Canadians. In the lead up to the June 1990 deadline for its approval, opposition began to mount. One of the many criticisms tabled against the accord was the supposed preferential treatment it gave the province of Quebec. One of the Accord's fiercest opponents was former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Trudeau argued that the Quebec government did not need additional powers nor did Quebec need to be recognized as a \\"distinct society\\". On January 22, 1990, 5 months before the deadline for reaching an agreement, Ciaccia responded to these criticisms in The Globe and Mail, framing the Accord, \\"Not as final chapter in our constitutional history, but as a stepping stone upon which we can build a solid future.\\". Contrary to Trudeau's claim that any reference to a \\"distinct society\\" was an insult, Ciaccia highlighted how recognition of cultural differences are arguably a key part of the Canadian identity. The accord would eventually fail to be finalized due in part to opposition from the provincial governments of Manitoba and Newfoundland. The failure of Meech is generally as the principal driving force behind the rebirth of sovereignty movement in the early 1990s, and subsequent defeat of the Quebec Liberals to the Parti Quebecois in 1994. Oka Crisis In March 1989, Oka Golf Club announced plans to expand its 9-hole golf course to a full 18. Close to the Kanehsatake reserve, the land in question included a native burial ground, marked by standing tombstones. Protests by Mohawks and environmentalists temporarily postponed the project, as the provincial government attempted to determine whether natives held a valid claim on the land. Such a process would take time as it involved going over land claims dating back to the 18th century. In his memoir on the crisis, Ciaccia argues that the dispute could have been solved quickly, noting \\"there was one key parcel of land without which the golf course could not be extended...Buy this land, and the most pressing problem would be solved. This is exactly what my officials in Quebec proposed to the federal minister of Indian Affairs[, Tom Siddon].\\" Ciaccia travelled to Ottawa himself to discuss the situation privately with his federal counterpart. Siddon, however decided not to purchase the land, arguing that there first needed to be stable band local leadership on the part of Kanehsatake Mohawks In April 1990, when negotiations stalled, Mohawks erected a roadblock on the road leading to land in dispute, effectively barricading it off from potential developers. On Tuesday, May 8, after the barricades received media attention, Ciaccia privately met with Oka mayor, Jean Ouellette. Ouellette showed Ciaccia plans for the proposed golf course expansion, which included residential development, and claimed the city would lose $2 million should the project fail to proceed. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Ciaccia privately assured Ouellette he would find the $2 million, thus allowing the Mohawks to keep their sacred ground undisturbed, while at the same time compensate the municipality for tax revenue. Ciaccia left the meeting confident a deal would soon be reached. Two days later, much to his surprise, Ouellette informed him the project would not be abandoned for $2 million, announcing his intention to have the barricades removed. Years later, Ciaccia would recall: \\"[Ouellette] made a complete about-face. He was pressing 'onward into the mouth of hell'...pursuing plans that would allow not a noble cause, but the destruction of natural beauty and the desecration of Native lands.\\" By June 30, the municipality of Oka obtained a legal injunction to have the barricades removed, which the Mohawks refused to acknowledge. On July 10, against Ciaccia's wishes, mayor Ouellette asked the Suret√© du Qu√©bec to enforce the injunction and dismantle the roadblock. Early next morning, on July 11, provincial police raided the barricades. Gunfire was exchanged with one police casualty; Corporal Marcel Lemay died from a gunshot wound to the mouth. Police had to retreat as teargas they'd fired blew back in their direction. The Canadian Army was subsequently called in, with a tense standoff ensuing for the rest of the summer. In a show of solidarity Mohawks in Kahnawake (a reserve on Montreal's south shore) would block the Mercier Bridge for several weeks. The crisis would go on to generate considerable anti-native sentiment in the province. The plight of Canada's indigenous peoples would also receive international attention and condemnation. Provincial highways leading to both Kanehsatake and Kahnawake were blocked by police. The standoff finally came to an end on September 26, 1990, with a negotiated surrender on the part of Mohawks. Plans to expand the golf course were eventually cancelled. Ciaccia faced criticism for his handling of the crisis. While some commentators praised his repeated efforts to find common ground between both sides, others accused him of not taking a harder stance towards the Natives, thus giving the impression of a breakdown of law and order. On July 26, 1990 it was reported that Ciaccia was allowing Mohawks to use a dock on the land of a Dorval property he owned. It was being used to ferry in supplies to Kahnawake, which had been blocked off by police checkpoints. The report caused a public outcry. Ciaccia acknowledged the dock's existence but maintained it was used solely for sending in essential goods such as food and medical supplies. In the aftermath of the crisis, both Ciaccia and Sam Elkas (then minister of public security) lost their ministerial positions in a cabinet shuffle in October 1990. This was widely seen as a rebuke from Bourassa for their handling of the crisis. Ciaccia nevertheless held on to his post as minister of International Trade. Despite his perceived sympathies for the Mohawks, Ciaccia was nevertheless critical of international condemnation regarding the provincial and federal government's handling of the Oka Crisis. On September 13, 1990 the European Parliament passed a resolution condemning the Canadian government's treatment of its Native population. In January 1991, Ciaccia would meet a delegation of MEPs who had come to Montreal on a fact- finding mission. After the meeting, Ciaccia told reporters that European lawmakers appeared to have some serious misconceptions of what had taken place during the crisis: namely that Ottawa has forcefully expropriated Mohawk land and that martial law had been declared. In light of this, Ciaccia stated, \\"the European Parliament is not here to tell Canada anything...it is here to learn.\\" According to a 1991 report on the crisis, released by the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy, Ciaccia stated he felt undermined by the provincial police during negotiations to end the standoff. During a 1993 coroner's inquest into the death of Corporal Lemay, Ciaccia testified that prior to the raid, he warned both the premier's office and his colleague, Public Security Minister Sam Elkas, that a police raid on the barricade could very well turn bloody. In 2000, Ciaccia published a personal memoir of the crisis, The Oka Crisis : A Mirror of the Soul. International Affairs As minister of international affairs, Ciaccia served as Quebec's chief representative in the international community from 1989 to 1994. Ciaccia participated in many trade missions, in search of potentially new markets for Quebec exporters. As minister, Ciaccia, visited over 40 countries including: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Poland, China, Vietnam, Israel, South Africa, France, Italy, Egypt, and the United States. Ciaccia was an ardent supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement, arguing it would increase growth in Quebec's service and high-tech industries, among others. In 1990, with the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, John Ciaccia and Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister at the time, proposed a working group designed to gauge the needs of French speakers in Poland, Romania, and Hungary, to determine the best way to sustain those linguistic minorities. The following year, Ciaccia headed trade missions to Hungary and Poland with the goal of strengthening economic and cultural ties between Quebec and the former Eastern Bloc countries. In 1992, Ciaccia visited Vietnam on a trade mission, another country in the process of liberalizing its economy. He helped sign an agreement promoting economic and technological cooperation between Vietnam and Quebec. Immigration and Cultural Communities Robert Bourassa resigned as premier and Liberal leader, due to his deteriorating health, in September 1993. Daniel Johnson Jr would emerge as Liberal leader and Premier in January 1994, along with a newly shuffled cabinet. Ciaccia was given a new portfolio, Immigration and Cultural Communities, in addition to his previously held one in International Affairs. In outlining a three-year plan on immigration, Ciaccia addressed concerns that the French language was in danger on the island of Montreal, where most immigrants to Quebec choose to settle. In the spring of 1994, Ciaccia held consultations across the province to determine whether the number of immigrants admitted annually should be revised. In June 1994, Ciaccia would eventually decide to keep immigration levels steady for the next three years, at around 43,000 a year 1994-1998: Opposition In 1994, with an upcoming election and the Liberals trailing the PQ in the polls, Ciaccia considered retiring from politics. Despite many other Liberal cabinet ministers deciding to leave politics before the election was called, Ciaccia ultimately decided to run. He would, once more, be re-elected in the riding of Mont-Royal. The election ushered in a majority Parti Quebec government, which soon set a date of October 30, 1995 for a referendum on independence. Just as he did during the 1980 referendum, Ciaccia actively campaigned for the \\"No\\" side in the 1995 referendum, acting as strategist for the No Committee. In the run-up to the vote, he accused the PQ of trying to block immigrants (a largely federalist constituency) from voting, via Bill 40, which would have set up the province's first computerized list of voters. On January 25, 1995, Ciaccia, along with 3 other anglophone MNAs (Thomas Mulcair, Geoffrey Kelly, and Christos Sirros) penned an opinion piece in the Gazette, denouncing Bill 40. The piece argued that, \\"with a referendum on the horizon, the government believes that these new rules would help its side when the votes are counted on referendum day.\\" In the lead-up to the referendum, Ciaccia made appearances at cultural and community events, and participated in media interviews, arguing for the federalist, \\"No\\" campaign. The \\"No\\" side would go on to win the referendum by a narrow margin of 50.6% to 49.4%. In September 1998, with a general election set for November 30, Ciaccia announced he would not be seeking re-election. \\"I feel that I have done as much as I could and that the time has come for me to try to do other things, to meet other challenges,\\" he explained to the Gazette. When asked if he faced pressure within the party to step aside, Ciaccia insisted the decision was made solely on his own accord, stating, \\"no one, no one, ever suggested that I shouldn't run again.\\" At the time of his decision to retire, he was the longest-serving member of the National Assembly. During the final day of his mandate, he received a standing ovation from members of all parties in the assembly along with a farewell handshake from PQ Premier Lucien Bouchard. According to fellow Liberal MNA, Thomas Mulcair, who shared an office with Ciaccia, \\"He has always been there to help and to give good advice and I am going to miss him a lot.\\" Retirement and death After retiring as MNA in 1998, Ciaccia remained a supporter of both the federal Liberals and Quebec Liberal Party. As a resident of the Montreal suburb of Beaconsfield, Ciaccia supported the controversial mega-city in which all municipalities on the Island of Montreal merged into one city. During the 2004 vote to de-merge from Montreal, Ciaccia campaigned for Beaconsfield to remain a part of the mega-city, serving on the pro-merger committee. In May 2004, Beaconsfield would vote to de-merge from Montreal. Ciaccia was a well- known figure in Montreal's Italian community, and frequent invitee to events organized by the Italian Chamber of Commerce. Ciaccia played piano for various fundraisers. A lifelong pianist, Ciaccia was inspired as a child by boogie- woogie greats such as Fats Waller (against the wishes of his mother, an ardent classicist). Ciaccia had one son, Mark, and two grandsons Erik and Nicholas. In the fall of 2015, 40 years after the James Bay agreement, John Ciaccia released his memoir, Call Me Giambattista. Ciaccia died in his home in Beaconsfield, Quebec on August 7, 2018, at the age of 85.

His father was the founder of Helsingsborgs Gummifabrik AB (sv), also known as Tretorn AB, a manufacturer of rubber products which Dunker established as an international business. At the time of his death in 1962, Dunker was Sweden's wealthiest man. His fortune was donated to the improvement of the city of Helsingborg. Early years The Dunker family had its origin in Schleswig- Holstein. The family lived in Esbjerg, Denmark when Henry was born in 1870. Henry was two years old when his father Johan Dunker, who was an engineer at the time, was asked to lead the work and building of property at the Port of Helsingborg. Business The factory in 1901 In 1891, Dunker's father Johan founded Helsingsborgs Gummifabrik AB. The rubber footwear produced by the factory was of poor quality, so the younger Dunker travelled to Russia to learn how to produce better rubber. During a visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia, he did not find any new material, but in Riga, Latvia he met chemist Julius von Gerkan, who agreed to help him improve the rubber formula. His company was known for creating a rubber that was soft when cold but not sticky when the weather improved. Bust of Henry Dunker at Helsingborg's Civic Theatre In 1894, Dunker took over control of the factory and, after some time, expanded the factory. In 1905, Dunker, along with Johan Kock, changed the Velox factory in Trelleborg into the Trelleborgs gummifabrik. Through a network of sales offices not only in Sweden but also in Copenhagen, Berlin and Vienna, Dunker gained better control over the distribution chain. With time, the rubber products produced by his company expanded to include tennis balls, shower caps and tires. In 1912, Dunker created a cartel with the purpose of increasing its competitive power abroad. Prices for the rubber increased in Sweden but were lowered abroad. Dunker gave his workers free healthcare and subsidized medicine. He installed wooden floors in his factories to improve the comfort of his workers. In 1911, he started a day care facility (barnkrubban) to provide care for his employees' children during the workday, a phenomenon that began in the 1850sColour Me Green, A Sustainable Preschool in Kareby, Kung√§lv ‚Äì A brief history of preschools in Sweden (p.16) but was still unusual in the early 20th century.

Yamyam was one of the main contributors for the Somali National Academy of Culture (SNAC), also known as the Somali National Academy of Arts, Sciences and Literature. He was active as a poet from the 1960s. There is no one consistent English translation of his name. Alternative spellings include Cabdulqaadir or Cabdilqaadir Xirsi. Early life and education Yamyam was born in the city of Dhuusa Mareeb, Galgadud Region, Italian Somaliland. Yamyam‚Äôs mother was Canoof Ibraahim. He was the youngest child of 6 and the only son to his mother as his other siblings had a different mother. Yamyam started attending Madrasa at age four and he finished studying the Quran by age eight. He attended the Somali School of Natural Sciences. He moved to the north-west of the country to pursue further education and graduated from Mogadishu University, producing hƒ±s first work when he was 18 years old. He was Islamic, following the predominant religion in Somaliland. Career He is famous both for his extensive study on peat bogs in the East Africa region and for his many poems and plays. =New Playwrights wƒ±th New Somali Orthography= With the new Somali alphabet or orthography in 1972, Yamyam and Hadrawi became members of a minority Somali poets who pen down their works as opposed to poets producing volumes of poems in the traditional Somali oral literature. Yamyam was recognized as an influential Somali poet and playwright whose creative output did not wane following the state's collapse and subsequent civil war which continued for a decade and a half. He lived in Mogadishu and continued to write poems and articles for Somali websites and newsletters on the misfortunes befallen on Somalia which was one of Africa's strongest countries during post-colonial era. Awards =First Poetry Competition in Hargaisa= Yamyam was the recipient of the first academic style Somali Poetry Competition held in Hargaisa in 1972. On Somali National Patriotic Programme Series, a 12 part series which aired on June 2013, Aamin Media Limited, placed Yamyam at Episode #8, right next to Abdullahi Suldan Tima Ade, another great Somali poet. The program profiles 12 great patriots and military persons who lived from mid 1400 to contemporary Somali heroes. Yamyam, as most other gifted entertainers, used his poetic talents to highlight the misfortunes that befell on his fellow Somalis as the result of the civil war and the ensuing chaos. He had a sense of humour that attracted both the young and old across Somali society. Suldan Tima Cade‚Äôs patriotic poems throughout the 1950 to 1970s were extended by Yamyam who continued the patriot legacy wƒ±th new interpretations of social and politics aspects in Somali life and adding his footprints on Somali Literature from the early 1970s until his death in 2005. Moving to Mogadishu After winning first of its kind poetry competition in Hargeisa in 1972, Yamyam moved to Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. He immediately found a job at the newly created National Folklore, Arts, Culture, Literature, which had such important cultural centers such as Somali National Theatre. At his tenure at SNAC center in Mogadishu, he wrote many poems, plays and other literary pieces. He worked for several government ministries and contributed to on air radio programs such as Radio Mogadishu and Radio Hargaisa and higher learning institutions, primarily, Somali National University at Gaheyr and Lafoole. Poetry and Public Services Some of his more famous poems are Gabay ammaan ah (A poem of praise), Kowda Maajo: Hambalyo 1975 (The First of May: Congratulations 1975), \\"Hees\\" (A hees poem), and Ma riyaa ma run baa (Is it a dream? Is it reality?). Two of his poems appeared in the magazines Sahan (Reconnaissance) and Horseed (Vanguard), although most of them still reached the public in oral form. Cali often wrote on social topics. One of his poems, for instance, was a commentary on the political situation of the Somali people in the late 1950s, and another, written in 1962, was a protest against the import of foreign cars when the mass of the people were still living in poverty.Tyloch, p.371‚Äì2 =Researcher and Contributor at SNAC= Yamyam was engaged in the Somali National folklore and poetry circles for nearly four decades. At the height of the Somali Military Revolution, Yamyam wrote poems directly accusing the government of attempting to create new social programs while much needed social programs lay in abandonment. One such poem was ' Digo rogasho' which he wrote in October 1984. In the early 1970s he went to the capital, Mogadishu, where he joined Waaberi (literally Dawn), a troupe of singers, dancers and playwrights. His genius at writing lyrics and poems was soon recognized by his contemporaries and his songs were performed on Radio Mogadishu. =Influencing Somali Society and Politics= Abdulkadir Yamyam co-authored with Ahmed Farah Ali Idaajaa for a popular play (primarily in verse) called Dabkuu Shiday Darwiishkii (The Fire that the Dervish Lit) about the anti-colonial resistance waged by the Somali Dervishes under the leadership of Sayid Mohamed Abdulle Hassan from 1900 to 1920. Farah Idaja wrote, that, Yamyam's play, about Somali Dervishes, Fire that the Dervish Lit, \\"Dabdkuu Shiday Darwiishkii\\" where the play's first scene depicts imagined scenes from European powers' conference in Barlin during 1884-1885 Africa colonial divisions. Although, Yamyam was a patriot, he often reflected European colonial past wrongdoings from 1884 Africa divisions to the 1894 \\"Tripartite Accord\\" from Britain, Italy and Ethiopia. His poetry reflected radicalism and dislike for the misuse of power and misappropriation of public funds of the toppled regime in Somalia in the 1970s and 1980s. Mind you, Yamyam was only four uncles removed to President Siad Barre and he was not easy on him- this came to light when later during the civil war he remained in Mogadishu despite his closeness to the overthrown president. =Civil War Years and Arta Peace Conference= Before he moved this August to the US to rejoin his family, who had settled there after the civil war in Somalia, Yam Yam (varyƒ±ng spellƒ±ng) lived in Mogadishu. Unfazed by the lawlessness. Throughout the 1990s decades at the heƒ±ght of two-decade long Somali civil war, he did not align himself with any of the tribal factions in Somalia. He felt a moral obligation to promote peace in his troubled country. At the Somalia National Peace Conference held in 2000, YamYam described the national of Somalia as \\"in ruins\\" and said he no longer celebrated national holidays. Yamyam is survived by his wife, four sons and two daughters. Rage, the eldest son of Yamyam is ƒ±n his own right a poet. He was one of the main entertainers of the 2007 annual Somali Community gathering honoring youngsters who achieve great academic success. Unlike most Somali poets, Yamyam penned down all his literary work starting from early on before he won the first academically conducted poetry competition held in Hargaisa. \\"I am Somali\\" In print material, the poet's name has varying spellings for his nickname, Yamyam or Yam Yam. Many people believe Yamyam was a long ago deceased poet at the time of Hooyaaleey style Somali poetry during the mid eighteenth century at time of Raage Ugaas and others because of in-depth content which he is unique for in his field as a great poet coupled with the academic work which he penned down, for example, his first play co-authoring with Ahmed Farah Ali 'Idaja', using the newly created Somali orthography. Ordinarily, Somali poets produce volumes of oral literature full of tribal feud but Yam Yam was an academic type, thus he refrained from using poetry and plays to \\"side with any of opposing sides\\" although he remained in Mogadishu throughout the 1990s when Mogadishu was the epicenter of the Somali civil war. In 2001, Yam Yam moved to Nairobi, Kenya to settling in Nairobi. While contributing to volumes of poems and dozens of plays for a span of nearly forty years, Yamyam is credited with numerous contributions and collaborations during the height of the civil war in Somalia from 1991 to his death in Columbus Ohio in 2005. Yamyam was greatly appreciated at his appearances at the year-long Somali National Peace Conference better known as Arta Peace Conference, held in Arta, Djibouti. Yamyam grew up in Hargaisa but he remained in Mogadishu for much of his working life including a decade and a half, a period when the Somali civil war years were at climax. When it came to show his patriotism, Yamyam gave hours of poetry entertainment and a dose of reality for the year-long Arta Somali Peace Conference. During the Arta Peace Conference, on the occasion of June 26 Northern Somalia Independence Day, He reminded every Somali that, he no longer celebrated independence days as Somalia \\"lay in ruins\\", since the choas and lawlessness in the capital Mogadishu. Later life Abdulkadir Hersi Siyad, better known by his nickname Yamyam, died in a car accident in Columbus, Ohio, United States aged 60.

Biography  =Origins= He was the son of Hasan ibn Sulayman Bughra Khan (simply called \\"Bughra Khan\\" in Persian sources), who was the eponymous ancestor of eastern branch of the Karakhanid family, known as the \\"Hasanids\\", which Ali-Tegin belonged to. Hasan is only known from Persian sources because of his wars with the Iranian Samanids, who used to be the rulers of Transoxiana before the Karakhanids under Nasr Khan annexed their territories in 999. =Rise to power= Ali- Tegin is first mentioned as being thrown in prison under the orders of his opponent Mansur Arslan Khan, but quickly managed to escape and receive help from a group of Oghuz Turks led by the Seljuq chief Arslan Isra'il. With these Oghuz Turks under his grasp, Ali-Tegin seized Bukhara and soon occupied all of Sogdia; after his conquest of the region, he took the title of \\"Y√Øgan-tigin\\" and another title of \\"Arslan Ilig\\". He gave his daughter in marriage to Arslan Isra'il. With the possession of the wealthy and important cities of Bukhara and Samarkand, Ali-Tegin became a powerful and influential figure in Central Asia; however, this strained his relations with his jealous brother Yusuf Qadir Khan hostile, which resulted in the latter allying himself with the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud (), who had received expression of discontent from Ali-Tegin's subjects and was himself annoyed by Ali-Tegin, who did not allow him to send envoys to Qadir Khan, whose territories consisted of the important cities of Khotan and Kashgar. Ali-Tegin, after having received the news of his brother's alliance with the Ghaznavids, responded by allying himself with his other brother Muhammad Toghan Khan. Khorasan, Transoxiana and Tokharistan =Conflict with the Ghaznavids= In 1024/5, a combined army under Mahmud and Qadir Khan invaded Ali-Tegin's territories and completely defeated him and his Seljuq supporters. Ali-Tegin then fled to the steppes, whilst Mahmud and Qadir Khan made a marriage alliance at Samarkand. Mahmud also managed to take the family of Ali-Tegin captive, which was fleeing towards the steppes, but was captured by an officer of his. Meanwhile, Arslan Isra'il fled to Ghaznavid territory in Khorasan and asked for permission to settle in the region in return for protecting the Ghaznavid borders from incursions by the other Turks of Transoxiana. Mahmud, not trusting him and his followers, had them imprisoned. Fortunately for Ali-Tegin, Mahmud had to withdraw from Transoxiana in order to prepare another expedition in India, which gave him the opportunity to make a counter-attack against Qadir Khan and re-conquer his former territories. Ali-Tegin, although not with the support of Arslan Isra'il any longer, still had support from the latter's nephews Tughril and Chaghri Beg. Ali-Tegin had a quarrel with the Seljuqs in 1029, but they still continued to serve and support him. After a brief civil war in the Ghaznavid state in 1030, Mahmud's son Mas'ud I became the new ruler of the Ghaznavid Empire, and continued his father's behavior of aggression towards Ali-Tegin; Mas'ud now intended to once and for all conquer Transoxania from Ali-Tegin and to give it to Qadir Khan's second son, who was his own brother-in-law, Muhammad Bughra Khan. In 1032, the Ghaznavid governor of Khwarazm, Altun Tash, captured Bukhara, and a battle was shortly fought at Dabusiyya, which became inconclusive; Altun Tash died during the battle, but one of his most trusted officer, Ahmad Shirazi, managed to successfully negotiate with Ali-Tegin, who agreed to return to Samarkand, whilst the Ghaznavid army withdrew back to their own territories. Meanwhile, in Khwarazm, Altun-Tash's son Harun became the new ruler of the region. However, unlike his father, he was hostile to the Ghaznavids and in 1034 made an alliance with Ali-Tegin, with whom he planned to invade Khorasan. However, before the invasion took place, Harun was assassinated by his own slaves, at the instigation of Mas'ud. Ali-Tegin died in the same year; his sons continued to preserve their father's authority in Transoxiana for a few years, until their relative B√∂ritigin () of the Alid branch seized their territories.

(Thus, curiously, the neighborhood of Panther Hollow lies not within the valley of Panther Hollow itself, but rather in Junction Hollow.) The hollow features the man-made Panther Hollow Lake, on the east end of which is the confluence of Panther Hollow Run (which generally follows the valley) and Phipps Run. Created in the 1880s, Panther Hollow Lake was once the center of a busy picnic and recreational area that included a boat house adjacent to the lake from which couples could rent boats for an afternoon. The boathouse was razed in the 1930s. Today, hiking trails follow both streams. The heavily-travelled Panther Hollow Road lies on the southern edge of the hollow. It begins where the Boulevard of the Allies ends at Anderson Bridge in Oakland and continues through Schenley Park to become Hobart Street to the park's east. Above the lake some 120 feet is Panther Hollow Bridge, which carries Schenley Drive over the hollow. The landmark 1897 bridge features bronze sculptures by Giuseppe Moretti of four panthers, crouching as sentinels, on each corner. The hollow is named for the mountain lions once native to the area. The University of Pittsburgh, adjacent to the park, also uses the panther as its mascot. At one time, painting or defacing the Moretti sculptures was a popular form of vandalism committed by the fans of rival universities prior to the schools' football games.

His figure of a nude female water carrier won the Academy's \\"Prix-de- Rome\\", which enabled him to study there for two years. He later became a Professor at the Academy in Nuremberg. His work gained the attention of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who chose him to produce a group of figures for the Kaiser's monumental Siegesallee (Victory Avenue) project. Later, in 1909, at the Kaiser's request, he produced a gigantic statue of Achilles in a victorious stance for the Achilleion, a palace on Corfu built by Elisabeth of Bavaria. The statue was meant to offset an earlier work by Ernst Herter called the \\"Dying Achilles\\".History in Corfu: The Achillion Palace.

Berg and Fritz Berg, was a Swedish engineer, industrialist and politician. He also founded the Swedish construction and development company Skanska.  Career  Between 1865 and 1868, Berg attended Teknologiska Institutet. In 1873, he became the managing director of Sk√•nska Cement AB (now Cementa [Cementation]). Berg made significant contributions to the cement industry and its development. In 1887, he founded the entrepreneurial company AB Sk√•nska Cementgjuteriet, later known as Skanska. He led a number of other companies, such as Malm√∂-Limhamns Railroads and AB Stranden. He was a council member in Malm√∂ from 1892 and vice president in 1907. Berg had a strong social commitment and was popular amongst the working class and fisher population in Limhamn, Sweden. Berg also founded the lecture society Malm√∂ f√∂rel√§sarf√∂rning that expanded to Malm√∂'s library and lecture society in 1882. Berg was the founder and creator of the Betel church at Lugnet in Malm√∂, which was first opened in 1886. With Anders Antonsson and Thure Petr√©n, he took the initiative to start the first employment office in Malm√∂ which opened in 1905. Berg was a member of the board of the Swedish employment association during the last years of his life, worked for a fair work bill and supported Gustav M√∂ller, who was one of Berg's employers and later a politician in the Swedish government. A supporter of equal rights for workers and owners, Berg is considered the founder of the \\"Svenska modellen\\" (the Swedish model).  Death  Berg died on 8 December 1907, the same day King Oscar II died. Berg's brother was the king's medical doctor, and had to attend at the king's deathbed, preventing him from reaching his own brother to help him. Berg's funeral in Limhamn in December 1907 was attended by about 700 people, including many workers and fishermen. A statue of Berg was erected in Limhamn and many locations in the city are named for him, such as R.F. Bergsgatan, Bergaskolan and R.F. Bergs kindergarten.

Unlike traditional PCIe Flash Storage devices, the ULLtraDIMM is plugged directly into an industry standard RDIMM memory bus slot in a server. This design and connection location provides deterministic (consistent) known latency to enable applications to be streamlined for improved performance. The ULLtraDIMM is compatible with the JEDEC MO-269 DDR3 RDIMM specification. The ULLtraDIMM supports support both 1.35 V and 1.5 V operation from 800‚Äì1333 MHz, and 1.5 V @ 1600 MHz DDR3 transfer rates. DDR3 ECC bits are used to verify the integrity of the data being sent across memory bus. The ULLtraDIMM will verify that correct ECC is received and, if there are errors, the device driver will re-run the transfer. The CPU treats the ECC from the ULLtraDIMM in the same manner as ECC from a memory DIMM, single symbol errors are corrected. The DDR3 ECC bits are not stored in the flash array. A separate ECC scheme is used for protecting data in the flash array. Memory interleaving of standard RAM is not affected by the presence of ULLtraDIMMs. UEFI/BIOS updates are required to properly recognize an ULLtraDIMM in the system as a block device and not halt the bootstrap sequence.

Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. The movement aimed to focus on unidealized subjects and events that were previously rejected in art work. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions. Realism was primarily concerned with how things appeared to the eye, rather than containing ideal representations of the world. The popularity of such \\"realistic\\" works grew with the introduction of photography‚Äîa new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real. The Realists depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social classes in a similar manner. Gloomy earth toned palettes were used to ignore beauty and idealization that was typically found in art. This movement sparked controversy because it purposefully criticized social values and the upper classes, as well as examining the new values that came along with the industrial revolution. Realism is widely regarded as the beginning of the modern art movement due to the push to incorporate modern life and art together. Classical idealism and Romantic emotionalism and drama were avoided equally, and often sordid or untidy elements of subjects were not smoothed over or omitted. Social realism emphasizes the depiction of the working class, and treating them with the same seriousness as other classes in art, but realism, as the avoidance of artificiality, in the treatment of human relations and emotions was also an aim of Realism. Treatments of subjects in a heroic or sentimental manner were equally rejected.Finocchio, Ross. \\"Nineteenth-Century French Realism\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. online (October 2004) Realism as an art movement was led by Gustave Courbet in France. It spread across Europe and was influential for the rest of the century and beyond, but as it became adopted into the mainstream of painting it becomes less common and useful as a term to define artistic style. After the arrival of Impressionism and later movements which downgraded the importance of precise illusionistic brushwork, it often came to refer simply to the use of a more traditional and tighter painting style. It has been used for a number of later movements and trends in art, some involving careful illusionistic representation, such as Photorealism, and others the depiction of \\"realist\\" subject matter in a social sense, or attempts at both.  Beginnings in France  Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet, 1854. A Realist painting by Gustave Courbet. The Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to Romanticism and History painting. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. The chief exponents of Realism were Gustave Courbet, Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, Honor√© Daumier, and Jean-Baptiste- Camille Corot.NGA Realism movement National Gallery glossary, Realism movementPhilosophy of Realism Jules Bastien-Lepage is closely associated with the beginning of Naturalism, an artistic style that emerged from the later phase of the Realist movement and heralded the arrival of Impressionism.Fry, Roger. 1920. \\"Vision and Design.\\" London: Chatto & Windus. \\"An Essay in √Üsthetics.\\" 11-24.

His groundbreaking paintings A Burial at Ornans and The Stonebreakers depicted ordinary people from his native region. Both paintings were done on huge canvases that would typically be used for history paintings. Although Courbet's early works emulated the sophisticated manner of Old Masters such as Rembrandt and Titian, after 1848 he adopted a boldly inelegant style inspired by popular prints, shop signs, and other work of folk artisans. In The Stonebreakers, his first painting to create a controversy, Courbet eschewed the pastoral tradition of representing human subjects in harmony with nature. Rather, he depicted two men juxtaposed against a charmless, stony roadside. The concealment of their faces emphasizes the dehumanizing nature of their monotonous, repetitive labor.

The Realist movement in France was characterized by a spirit of rebellion against powerful official support for history painting. In countries where institutional support of history painting was less dominant, the transition from existing traditions of genre painting to Realism presented no such schism.Rubin, J. 2003. \\"Realism\\". Grove Art Online. An important Realist movement beyond France was the Peredvizhniki or Wanderers group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as genre artist Vasily Perov, landscape artists Ivan Shishkin, Alexei Savrasov, and Arkhip Kuindzhi, portraitist Ivan Kramskoy, war artist Vasily Vereshchagin, historical artist Vasily Surikov and, especially, Ilya Repin, who is considered by many to be the most renowned Russian artist of the 19th century. Courbet's influence was felt most strongly in Germany, where prominent realists included Adolph Menzel, Wilhelm Leibl, Wilhelm Tr√ºbner, and Max Liebermann. Leibl and several other young German painters met Courbet in 1869 when he visited Munich to exhibit his works and demonstrate his manner of painting from nature.Nationalgalerie (Berlin), and Fran√ßoise Forster-Hahn. 2001. Spirit of an Age: Nineteenth-Century Paintings From the Nationalgalerie, Berlin. London: National Gallery Company. p. 155. In Italy the artists of the Macchiaioli group painted Realist scenes of rural and urban life. The Hague School were Realists in the Netherlands whose style and subject matter strongly influenced the early works of Vincent van Gogh. In Britain artists such as the American James Abbot McNeill Whistler, as well as English artists Ford Madox Brown, Hubert von Herkomer and Luke Fildes had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues and depictions of the \\"real\\" world. In the United States, Winslow Homer and Thomas Eakins were important Realists and forerunners of the Ashcan School, an early-20th- century art movement largely based in New York City. The Ashcan School included such artists as George Bellows and Robert Henri, and helped to define American realism in its tendency to depict the daily life of poorer members of society. Later on in America, the term realism took on various new definitions and adaptations once the movement hit the U.S. Surrealism and magical realism developed out of the French realist movement in the 1930s, and in the 1950s new realism developed. This sub-movement considered art to exist as a thing in itself opposed to representations of the real world. In modern-day America, realism art is generally regarded as anything that does not fall into abstract art, therefore including mostly art that depicts realities.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill. Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that \\"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. The bill covers appropriations for the Department of Defense. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall. In 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013 when the new fiscal year. This led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, 2013, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the debt limit until February 7, 2014. In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers has stated that his goal is to pass all twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015 before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation. Provisions of the bill *The bill would appropriate $491 billion to the Defense Department. This amount was $200 million over what President Obama requested in his budget and $4.1 billion more than the fiscal year 2014 enact level. *The Defense Department would not be allowed to use any of the appropriated funds to move prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. *The bill \\"would cut off funding for arms deals with Russian corporation Rosoboronexport until\\" the Secretary of Defense can \\"certify the company has stopped transferring weapons into Syria.\\" Procedural history The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 13, 2014 by Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ). The bill was under the jurisdiction of the United States House Committee on Appropriations. It was scheduled to be considered on the House floor on June 18, 2014. Debate and discussion The provision of the bill that forbade the transfer of Guantanamo Bay prisoners was a reaction to the controversial exchange of five prisoners in exchange for the return of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl from the Taliban. =Failed provisions= Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) offered two amendments in committee, both of which failed. The first would have prohibited the use of any funds for use with the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. Lee said it was time to give the Iraq War \\"an official, legal end.\\" The amendment was voted down 31-17, with Rep. Frelinghuysen arguing that there were no funds devoted to Iraq in the bill and all the troops had left in 2011. Lee's second amendment would have required the executive branch to report to Congress on actions taken under the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists from 13 years ago. This amendment was also defeated, 27-21, with Frelinghuysen arguing that it could give away classified information.

It was formed in 1871 by Sullivan Forehand and Henry C. Wadsworth after the death of their father- in-law, Ethan Allen of Ethan Allen & Company, and was acquired in 1902 by Hopkins & Allen, a firearms company based in Connecticut. History In 1871, Sullivan Forehand and Henry C. Wadsworth founded Forehand & Wadsworth from the remnants of Ethan Allen & Company after the death of their father-in-law, Ethan Allen. Wadsworth sold his share of the company to Forehand in 1890 in order to retire, and the company was rebranded as Forehand Arms. The company manufactured a variety of black powder and cartridge revolvers, including several versions of the British Bull Dog revolver. Other offerings included derringers, rifles, and shotguns. Forehand's sons ran the business for several years following the death of their father, then sold it in 1902 to Hopkins & Allen, who had been making Forehand Arms' revolvers under contract. =Legal matters= The company was involved with a patent infringement lawsuit on behalf of one of their employees, John C. Howe, against the United States government. Howe had patented an ammunition cartridge in 1864, and the US government infringed upon this design in 1868 with the \\"Cup Anvil Cartridge\\" until the expiration of Howe's patent in 1881. Howe asked Forehand to bring a lawsuit against the government, and eight years later the company won the suit on behalf of Howe with a judgement of $66,000. The lawsuit was not paid until after Howe's death and a few weeks before the death of Forehand in 1898.

Under the leadership of the Klapmeiers, Cirrus was the first aircraft manufacturer to install a whole-plane parachute recovery system as a standard on all its models‚Äîdesigned to lower the airplane (and occupants) safely to the ground in case of an emergency. The device is attributed with saving over 150 lives to date. From the brothers' use of all-composite airframe construction and glass panel cockpits on production aircraft, Cirrus is known for having revolutionized general aviation for modern light aircraft pilots. Forbes magazine named Cirrus's highly popular single-engine SR-series (the SR20 and SR22, certified in 1998 and 2000 respectively) Best Private Airplane, saying \\"the Klapmeier brothers built the first genuinely new plane in the sky in many years\\", Time magazine regarded them as \\"giving lift to the small-plane industry with an easy-to-fly design\\", and Flying magazine ranked Alan and Dale at number 17 on its list of 51 Heroes of Aviation. The Klapmeier brothers were inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2014. The brothers started Cirrus in the basement of their parents' rural dairy barn near Baraboo, Wisconsin. Their first design, the VK-30 homebuilt aircraft, had its initial flight in 1988, although kit deliveries ceased only a few years later. As the company grew they moved it in 1994 to Duluth, Minnesota, where from 2003 until his departure from Cirrus in 2009, Alan had heavy influence over the early design and development of the Vision Jet. Dale then continued the program, leading it to certification in 2016 and production in the ensuing years. The aircraft won the Collier Trophy in 2018 for representing the first jet of its kind to enter the market. After Cirrus, Alan became CEO of Kestrel Aircraft in 2010, which in 2015 was merged with Eclipse Aerospace to form One Aviation. Dale remains at Cirrus as a senior advisor and served as the company's CEO from 2011 to 2019. Background =Early life= Klapmeier family in the 1970s at their rural Wisconsin farmhouse. (Klapmeier brothers at the top right corner: Alan left, Dale right) Alan and Dale Klapmeier grew up in DeKalb, Illinois and attended DeKalb High School. Their parents bought a second home in the early 1970s on a small farm near Baraboo, Wisconsin. Aviation was a part of the brothers' lives from a very early age; Alan told Airport Journals in 2006 that when he was a baby, the only way his mother could get him to stop crying at times was to bring him to an airport and park the car at the end of the runway so he could watch airplanes. The brothers constantly built model airplanes as infants and Dale would pester their father into letting them build real ones. When Dale reached the age of 15, he learned to fly in a Cessna 140 before learning to drive a car. While still in high school, Alan joined the Civil Air Patrol at age 17 as a way of getting cheaper flying lessons. He often visited local airports to talk to pilots and even told his friends that he wanted to design aircraft, speaking about how he and his younger brother would one day compete with Cessna. =Family= Alan and Dale are two of three children born to Larry and Carol Klapmeier. They come from an entrepreneurial family. The eldest brother, Ernie Klapmeier, opened his own accessory store of military reenactment goods and regalia in Aurora, Illinois and has managed the shop since its founding in 1997; their uncle, Jim Klapmeier, and grandfather, Elmer Klapmeier, were both entrepreneurs in the boat manufacturing industry and started as a small, two-person company building pontoon-like houseboats on Rainy Lake, Minnesota throughout the 1950s. Elmer ran a second business flying a single-engine 'puddle jumper' plane around Wisconsin delivering parts to dairy farmers, while Jim later moved the boat project to a facility in Mora, Minnesota where he grew and retained it for several decades, transitioning into the market of fiberglass motor yachts. Larry and Carol were also entrepreneurs who founded a successful nursing home near Chicago, of which the three brothers worked at as kids doing janitorial chores during the 1960s and 1970s. =Education= Alan graduated in 1980 from Wisconsin's Ripon College with degrees in physics and economics. While a senior there in 1979, he began developing sketches of an airplane that would become the Cirrus VK-30. Dale graduated in 1983 from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point with degrees in business administration and economics. He once said that his fall-back plan was to become a banker had their early career in aviation never succeeded. Career =Early work= In 1979, Dale discovered a wrecked 1960 Champion 7-GC flipped over and abandoned at an airport in northern Wisconsin. The brothers then bought the plane from its owner with the very little money they had and rebuilt it in the shed at their family farmhouse. This was their first experience tinkering with an aircraft as a self-taught restoration project, followed by the making of a Glasair 1 they saw introduced at the 1980 EAA Convention and Fly-In (now called AirVenture) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. David Gustafson of Aircraft Spruce reported that the only way the Klapmeier brothers' parents would lend them the money to buy a Glasair was if they wrote up a business plan explaining why constructing a homebuilt would further their professional lives. =Cirrus Aircraft= 1980s: VK-30, barn, inspiration for parachute, municipal airport Klapmeier brothers in 1984 outside their parents' dairy barn near Baraboo, Wisconsin. (Alan sitting in chair as Dale holds up a cutout of the first Cirrus VK-30 kit) After Alan and Dale both graduated from college they formed an aircraft company in 1984, which they named \\"Cirrus Design\\" (now known as Cirrus Aircraft) in remembrance of a summer drive the brothers had a few years back where they saw cirrus clouds on the horizon and wished that they were flying. Once they formed the company, the Klapmeiers called upon Alan's old college roommate, Jeff Viken, to help out with their new design: the VK-30 (VK standing for Viken-Klapmeier). Viken was an aeronautical engineer who eventually married another aeronautical engineer, Sally Viken, and the unpaid Cirrus staff grew to four volunteers (with occasional help from the Klapmeiers' high school friend, Scott Ellenberger). The Cirrus VK-30 was a four to five-seat composite pusher with conventional wings and tail. Alan and Dale moved into the family farmhouse to be closer to the project, and began work on the airplane in the basement of the barn \\"down where the cows were\\". They all pitched in with the designing and balanced that with hands-on labor. Jeff designed the airfoil while Sally designed the flap system. The four of them would finish designing a part or a system, build it, and return to designing. Experimental aircraft innovator Molt Taylor gave the Klapmeiers and Vikens technical advice surrounding the VK-30. resin over the VK-30's fiberglass mold in the basement of their barn, about 1985 The Klapmeier brothers would often fly their Champ from the farm up to their uncle's boat- building business in Mora to borrow tools and other supplies‚Äîsuch as polyester resin‚Äîfor building the plane and molding its fuselage. To reduce cost, they went to different junk yards around Wisconsin and bought what they needed: a control system out of a wrecked Piper aircraft, a Cherokee nose landing gear to weld parts onto it and convert it to a retractable gear, and an O-540 (290 hp) engine they got off a scrapped de Havilland Heron. The first VK-30 slowly took shape. In 1985, near the Sauk‚ÄìPrairie Airport airport shortly after takeoff, Alan was involved in a fatal mid-air collision where his airplane lost a portion of its wing, including half of the aileron. The other plane spun into the ground killing the pilot, but Alan was able to maneuver a landing back on the runway by keeping high airspeed and using full aileron deflection. From surviving this incident, Alan sought to make flying safer‚Äîultimately leading to the brothers' pursuit of implementing a parachute on all their designs starting in the mid-1990s. Original Cirrus Design headquarters on the Baraboo-Dells Airport In 1986, the Klapmeiers hired their first paid-employee, an experienced welder and aluminum component designer by the name of Dennis Schlieckau. They then borrowed money from friends and family in order to build a hangar on the Baraboo-Wisconsin Dells Airport, and moved the VK-30 project from the barn to their new Baraboo headquarters with now only three other employees assisting them (a few years later they would build a second hangar for the production of more prototypes). VK-30 on ramp in Baraboo Their first display of the VK-30 was at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh airshow in 1987. In 1988, the Cirrus team was gradually beginning to grow with over a dozen employees. That year the Klapmeiers hired a couple of their most vital employees to date: Patrick Waddick, Cirrus's current President and Chief Operating Officer (originally hired as an intern sweeping floors), and Paul Johnston, the company's Chief Engineer, also known as one of their most gifted designers. After conducting multiple stress-tests on the wing, the first VK-30 prototype was ready to fly. Both Alan and Dale wanted to make the first flight but their mother would not let them. Jeff Viken knew a test pilot from NASA Langley named Jim Patton, who made the first test flight on February 11, 1988. They sold their first few kits at EAA AirVenture later that same year. Jeff and Sally Viken left the company shortly thereafter. Cirrus team circa 1989-1990. (Dale top far left, Alan top far right) At the end of the 1980s, the Klapmeier brothers approached inventor Sam Williams of Williams International about the possibility of installing a small, single fan-jet engine on the VK-30. The idea never materialized at the time, however, this effort is what would significantly inspire the design of the original Vision Jet concepts from the early-to-mid 2000s. 1990s: ST50, factory, SR20, company innovation and flight-testing In the early 1990s, sales of the VK-30 were dwindling down; it became a market failure. By the time they discontinued production in the middle of the decade they had sold and shipped out 40 kits, of which only 13 were finished and flown. Towards the end of 1991, the brothers began to question their goals and started thinking about their lifelong dream of getting into the world of certified aircraft. Alan began making sketches for the ST-50, a four-seat single-engine turboprop. Dale wanted something simpler and began fiddling with a concept that was to evolve into the SR20. Cirrus-Israviation ST50 at the Paris Air Show in 1997 Towards the mid '90s, Cirrus started designing the ST-50 under contract to Israeli aircraft manufacturer IsrAviation. The aircraft was configured like the VK-30 but was powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6-135, in place of the piston engine used in the VK-30. The prototype was first flown on December 7, 1994. During the beginning of that year, Alan and Dale moved the company from their headquarters in Baraboo to a 30,000-square-foot research and development facility in Duluth, Minnesota, bringing 35 employees with them and hiring another 15 at once. They began work on the Cirrus SR20, a four-passenger, single-engine, piston-powered composite aircraft. That's when Cirrus released its new marketing campaign: \\"Hangar X\\". It displayed a secret facility with nothing but a dim light and slightly cracked door. Inside was the \\"mysterious to-be-certified aircraft\\", but its unveiling would not come for a few more months, during the summer of 1994. Around this time, the brothers had the roles of Alan traveling around the country looking for investors and raising the capital Cirrus needed to certify the SR20, and Dale staying back at the factory overseeing operations by keeping the design, testing and production moving. The first prototype of the SR20 made its maiden flight in March 1995. The following year, the company broke ground on a 67,500-square-foot manufacturing facility in Grand Forks, North Dakota. In 1997, Cirrus started assembly of its first production prototype and added another 80,000-square- feet onto their Duluth facility for manufacturing purposes. Cirrus SR20 test deployment of CAPS in 1998, Scott Anderson piloting Through the Klapmeiers' vision, the SR20 became the first of many production advancements within light general aviation aircraft, including glass computer-monitored flight-displays instead of round analog dials (which would boast flat-panel avionic utilities such as satellite weather, traffic awareness and GPS steering), side-yoke flight controls instead of traditional yoke or stick consoles, all-composite construction instead of aluminum, and, most popularly known, the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). The Cirrus team spent several weeks during the summer of 1997 in the high desert of southern California testing the parachute. They would drop barrels of sand out a C-123 Cargo plane and flip a switch that would deploy the chutes when the barrels reached nearly 200 mph. The parachutes failed to deploy on multiple drop-tests before properly functioning. By the summer of 1998, they were ready to try the tests with an actual SR20. Chief Test Pilot Scott D. Anderson, a Stanford graduate and \\"Renaissance man\\" who was known as a beloved and charismatic figure in Duluth, successfully made the first deployment of CAPS, and would go on to make all seven of the inflight test-deployments for development and certification of the SR20. The airplane became FAA approved and type certified in October 1998. Receiving type certificate for the SR20 in 1998. (From left to right: Alan Klapmeier, Cirrus President Patrick Waddick, and Dale Klapmeier far right) On March 23, 1999, tragedy struck Cirrus when Scott Anderson was killed in a crash near the Duluth International Airport as he put the first production SR20 through torture-test maneuvers before it went on sale. The plane Anderson was flying had an aileron jam and was not yet equipped with the standard ballistic parachute that would come certified on every aircraft. Dale spoke at his induction into the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame on April 24, 2010, saying, \\"Scott was an exemplary pilot and person‚Ä¶ To date, 17 CAPS deployments have saved 35 lives due to Scott's pioneering work.\\" Despite the tragedy, and the Klapmeier brothers losing a close friend and their most talented test pilot, Cirrus fixed the problem that killed Anderson and continued on to deliver the first SR20 in July 1999‚Äîreceiving 400 orders by the first year alone. 2000s: SR22, success and company growth, Vision Jet, recession In the early 2000s, sales of the SR20 were steadily rising. This led to the Cirrus SR22, a faster, higher and more powerful version of the SR20. Production on the new aircraft started in 2001. In August of that year, Cirrus sold 58% of the company for $100 million to Crescent Capital, the US arm of the First Islamic Investment Bank of Bahrain (now called Arcapita), making the Klapmeier brothers minority stakeholders in their own company. 2003 piston- powered Cirrus SR22 By the middle of 2003, the SR22 had become the highest- selling general aviation aircraft in the world, beating out even that of Cessna Aircraft and achieving the brothers' lifelong dream. Cirrus had more than 600 employees then; two years later that number would reach to just over 1,000. The company was quickly expanding. Success for the Klapmeier brothers continued when they received the prestigious 2004 Ernst & Young Entrepreneurs of the Year Award for Manufacturing. In 2006, Cirrus accomplished all-time record deliveries, celebrating their 3,000th SR-series aircraft off the production line only seven years after deliveries commenced. Thirty-five special edition turbocharged SR22s were released that same year. They were entitled \\"Signature Editions\\", and came with several additional features including the signatures of both Alan and Dale imprinted on the plane's cowling. In June 2007, the Klapmeiers‚Äîalong with Vice President of Advanced Development Mike Van Staagen‚Äîunveiled their next design, \\"The-Jet by Cirrus\\" (now known as the Vision SF50), a single-engine, low-wing, seven-seat very light jet aircraft, also intended to be equipped with the company's CAPS parachute. The first flight of the jet occurred on July 3, 2008. In September 2008, the global sales slump in piston-engined aircraft impacted the company and they laid off 100 workers, 8% of their workforce. This included 79 people at the main plant in Duluth, Minnesota, and 29 employees at the composite construction plant in Grand Forks, North Dakota. After this round of layoffs, Cirrus had 1,230 employees remaining. Alan, the then-CEO, announced in October 2008 that due to the economic recession and resulting lack of demand for Cirrus aircraft, the company was moving to a three-day work week. He reported that sales were down 10% over the same period in the previous year. Compared to the industry average in that same period, sales were down 16%. Cirrus eliminated 208 employee positions in fall 2008 and cut aircraft production from 14 to 12 aircraft per week in response to the economic situation. In November of that year, the company announced that it would furlough about 500 production employees to allow for reductions in excess stock of aircraft produced. On December 18, 2008, it was made public that Chief Operating Officer Brent Wouters would replace Alan as CEO effective February 1, 2009. Alan continued as Chairman of the board with Dale as Vice-Chairman. Cirrus Vision SF50 single-engine jet On June 26, 2009, Alan announced that he had assembled a team to acquire the aircraft manufacturer's Vision SF50 single- engine jet program from majority owner Arcapita Bank and produce it under a new company. Dale came out in support of his efforts and said that Alan was the only person Cirrus would consider letting take over the jet project. Over a month later the attempt failed and Wouters announced that Alan's contract as Chairman would not be renewed when it expired at the end of August (a decision Wouters said Alan had known about for \\"several months\\" prior). Alan left Cirrus soon after this while Dale stayed with the company. 2010s: End of business partnership, separate career paths =Alan and Kestrel= At the 2010 EAA airshow, Alan introduced his new venture, the Kestrel Aircraft Company, and would serve as its CEO. Kestrel is to produce the Kestrel K-350, a single turboprop-engined all-composite six-seat aircraft. Some of his ex- Cirrus colleagues join him in the project, including Steve Serfling, Cirrus' former Director of Product Development. The company was originally set to locate its headquarters in Brunswick, Maine, but after complications with state tax credits, Alan decided in 2012 to move manufacturing operations to Superior, Wisconsin where they received a better financial package. The total value of loans, grants and tax credits was $118 million, $112 million from the state, with the expected eventual creation of around 600 workers by 2016, the most new jobs in Superior since World War II. In 2013, Kestrel employed about 60 workers in Superior, located right across the border from Cirrus, and about 40 in Brunswick, where composite components for the plane were being created. In May 2014, it was reported that Kestrel had fallen months behind on loan payments to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) due to financing delays. Alan spoke on the matter saying, \\"We're obviously still very excited about the program. We've made a lot of progress on the design, what we expect to build, what we expect to do with the FAA, but there are other frustrations. Certainly financing the project has been slower than we had hoped and expected.\\" It was also reported that the delay in financing had impacted hiring, causing the company to reduce its staff in Superior. The WEDC and Kestrel agreed upon new terms that would defer the payments until November 2014. On 15 April 2015, Kestrel merged with Albuquerque, New Mexico-based Eclipse Aerospace to form One Aviation, with Alan appointed CEO. The company has faced many legal and financial challenges since its formation. In September 2015, Alan indicated that Kestrel's resulting lack of economic and developmental progress \\"never would have happened if the state [of Wisconsin] had come through with the financing on time.\\" In 2017, he told AINonline that development of the K-350 \\"had been shelved\\" while One Aviation focuses on certifying the Eclipse 700 very light jet. In October 2018, the company voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. A bankruptcy exit plan was approved in September 2019 and by March 2020, Chinese company Citiking International was declared the new owner. =Dale and Cirrus= In September 2009, Dale became interim Chairman of Cirrus. On 19 September 2011, Cirrus named him the new CEO, and announced that Brent Wouters \\"is no longer with the company\\". In April 2012, after a few years of financial struggle, the company informed that its Vision SF50 jet program was fully funded through certification and early production, with a major investment from their newly acquired owners China Aviation Industry General Aircraft Company (CAIGA) (an acquisition that was initially met with much local skepticism when it was announced in early 2011). Dale called the jet investment a \\"tremendous milestone\\" for the company and that the new owners \\"are actively partnering with Cirrus while providing substantial resources for us to meet and exceed our shared goals.\\" In 2013 and 2014, Cirrus had its strongest years in sales and deliveries since before the 2008 recession, naming its SR22/22T model the best-selling general aviation airplane for the 12th year in a row. The company flew three new Vision SF50 conforming prototypes and employed over 800 people in 2014, having hired more than 300 of them in the past three years alone. In May 2015, Dale and Chief Customer Officer Todd Simmons announced that Cirrus will be expanding to an additional facility in Knoxville, Tennessee, called the \\"Vision Center\\", where all customer activities for the company will take place. On 28 October 2016, Cirrus received type certification for the SF50, making it the first single-engine civilian jet to become certified with the FAA. Deliveries began in December 2016. In June 2018, Dale accepted the Collier Trophy on behalf of Cirrus and the Vision Jet team. The trophy is awarded for \\"the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America\\" in the preceding year. On 19 December 2018, it was made public that Dale will step down as CEO sometime in the first-half of 2019 and transition into a senior advisory role for the company. During this time, Cirrus will conduct an internal and external search for a new CEO. On 4 June 2019, Cirrus announced that former Tesla Inc. executive Zean Nielsen has been selected to succeed Dale as its next CEO. By the end of 2019, Cirrus had 1,600 employees and accomplished its best year ever in sales, naming its Vision SF50 the most- delivered general aviation jet for the last two years. Management distinctions Professionally, Alan is known as more of the talkative, risk- taking \\"dreamer\\" out of the two, whereas Dale has been known to be the more taciturn, hands-on \\"practical one\\". Many say this is partly what made the duo so successful‚ÄîAlan would think up creative ideas and Dale would figure out how to get them done. Dale told the Duluth News Tribune in 2009 that, \\"The difference between the two of us is that Alan is a dreamer, and he's extremely aggressive in what he wants. I'm far more conservative than he is, and I've always loved the hands-on stuff\\"; and Alan told Airport Journals in 2006 that, \\"Dale is more practical [than me]‚Äîunbelievably practical, in fact. Dale figures out how to make [the design] work.\\" Throughout most of the brothers' early career, Alan administered as president at Cirrus with Dale as vice president. In a 1999 IndustryWeek article featuring the Klapmeiers, Alan joked that he was president simply \\"because he is the older brother\\"; and in an article published by Aircraft Spruce in 2012, about the Klapmeiers' homebuilding efforts throughout the 1980s, Dale credited Alan with being the \\"inspiration, the driving force\\" behind their goals. Boards and other affiliations The Klapmeier brothers have both served on numerous aviation boards and programs. Alan served on the board of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), AOPA's Air Safety Foundation, and the Small Aircraft Manufacturers Association. He currently serves on the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)'s board and the advisory board for MVP Aero Inc. Dale served on the Red Tail Project (now Red Tail Squadron), EAA's Young Eagles Program, and NASA's Aeronautics Research & Technology Roundtable, along with the founding board of the Scott D. Anderson Leadership Foundation. He is currently on AirSpace Minnesota's board and the advisory board for the Aircraft Kit Industry Association (AKIA). In 2003, Alan and Dale donated a fully operational SR20 to the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington, as a learning tool for school students. Ten years later, Dale donated an SR22 to Minneapolis-based STEM learning center AirSpace Minnesota. For much of the 2000s, Alan was part-owner of Bluewater Yachts, a central-Minnesota boat manufacturing company that the brothers' uncle co-founded in the 1950s, with the slogan \\"Different By Design\\". Dale participates in a snowmobiling fundraising event called the \\"Black Woods Blizzard Tour\\", an annual snowmobile excursion around northern Minnesota that raises money to fight ALS. He has also been involved in the charity flight organization Angel Flight West. Personal lives In addition to his 2006 Cirrus SR22, Alan owns a Piper Meridian and a 1950 DHC-1 Chipmunk. Dale owns a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a 2003 Corvette. Both brothers are avid snowmobilers. For their business and personal travels, Alan flies an Eclipse 500 SE and Dale a Cirrus Vision SF50. There have been reports of a personal falling-out between the brothers that occurred around the time of Alan's departure from Cirrus in 2009. Alan told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2012 that he had not spoken to Dale in several years, but would not discuss the reasons why on record. In March 2014, Alan brought Cirrus to court over a violated non-disparagement clause involving a 2011 interview with former Cirrus CEO Brent Wouters, in which Wouters allegedly criticized Alan's ability to lead a large company during times of \\"economic downturn\\". A Minnesota jury awarded Alan $10 million in lost profits and out-of-pocket expenses. Cirrus appealed the verdict and the state Court of Appeals overturned the ruling in a 2-1 decision, stating that the calculation of damages was \\"too speculative\\" and failed to demonstrate the amount to a \\"reasonable degree of certainty\\". The Minnesota Supreme Court denied to hear Alan's appeal and the lawsuit was settled in December 2015. Alan was married to Sara Dougherty from 2002 until their divorce in 2016. Together with his first wife, Patti Graves, whom he was married to from 1987 to 1999, he has two daughters: Kathryn (born 1989) and Sarah (born 1993). Dale has been married to Patricia Meyer since 1984 and together they have two sons: Ryan (born 1988) and Blake (born 1992). Dale said in a 2008 interview that one of his main incentives behind co-designing the Cirrus SR20 was that it had to be an airplane that Patricia \\"would want to fly in more than drive\\", which helped change the direction of the company in the 1990s. Reputation and recognition Klapmeiers' Wright brothers-inspired SR22 in 2005 Through Cirrus, the Klapmeier brothers are generally credited with revolutionizing the light personal aircraft industry for the modern era. They have been referenced several times in national articles and columns such as The Atlantic and The New York Times Magazine by journalist, author and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, James Fallows, who said in a 2010 article that the brothers \\"absolutely transformed what had been a stagnant, declining industry.\\" They were also a central theme in Fallows' 2001 book, Free Flight: Inventing the Future of Travel. Aviation communities have often compared the Klapmeier brothers to the Wright brothers, giving them the nickname, \\"modern day Wright brothers\\". Some say this gave more public sentiment to Cirrus' 2003 release of the \\"Centennial Edition\\", an SR22 that celebrated 100 years of flight with a mural of the Wright Flyer coating the tail of the plane. The story of Cirrus has also garnered comparisons to Apple Inc., while Alan and Dale have been called \\"aviation‚Äôs equivalent of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak\\". The first time the Klapmeiers gained national exposure was in 1998 when radio commentator Paul Harvey spoke positively about Cirrus and the SR20 on his syndicated program. In the 2004 vice-presidential debate, former Vice President Dick Cheney indirectly mentioned the Klapmeier brothers, calling them and Cirrus \\"a great success story\\". The Klapmeiers have also been praised multiple times for their efforts by former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty. After a visit to the Duluth Cirrus factory in 2003, Pawlenty thanked Alan and Dale for \\"their foresight in creating a new aircraft, bringing it to the market, and the associated risks they took to make it happen.\\" The late 18-term Minnesota Congressman Jim Oberstar was a strong supporter of the Klapmeiers as well, and was one of the main proponents behind bringing Cirrus to Duluth, Minnesota‚Äîalong with Cirrus Vice President of Business Administration Bill King and former Duluth Mayor Gary Doty. The Klapmeier brothers received the Living Legends of Aviation award in 2007 at a ceremony in Beverly Hills, California. Among the attendees that year were aerospace pioneers and celebrities such as Bob Hoover, Buzz Aldrin, Steve Fossett, Michael Dorn, Patty Wagstaff, Cliff Robertson, Chuck Yeager, and many more. British business magnate Alan Sugar said that he admired the Klapmeier brothers for starting Cirrus from \\"virtually scratch\\" and for their use of technologies like ballistic parachutes, glass cockpits, and manufactured composite airframes. Besides Lance Neibauer of Lancair, who delivered nearly 600 Columbia-series aircraft, the Klapmeier brothers are the only kit-makers to ever successfully transition into the design and production of certified aircraft. In both separate cases, the EAA served as a crucial \\"training ground\\" for Neibauer and the Klapmeiers to stimulate their ambitions.

The Lippitts Hill camp has played several historic roles in the defence of London, and is currently home to the National Police Air Service which took control of the operations from Metropolitan Police Air Support Unit on 31 March 2015. The hill was the site of a gun emplacement in the First World War and used as an anti-aircraft site in the Second World War. The United States's 184th anti-aircraft artillery installed their own guns in 1941, and added an underground control room and block houses to the site. A prisoner of war camp was established at Lippitts Hill by the British after the camp was abandoned by the Americans in 1944. Relics from the Second World War at the camp include a memorial to the American forces that served there, and a concrete sculpture of a man, left by a German prisoner of war, Rudi Webber. The local branch of the Peace Pledge Union, a pacifist organisation, would invite local prisoners of war from the camp to their homes on Christmas Day. The Lippitts Hill camp was used for civil defence purposes after the war and by the police. The Metropolitan Police Firearms Training Unit was based at Lippitts Hill, and it was the site of the Metropolitan Police's first firearms training course. A new centre (MPSTC) is now operation at Gravesend. The hill was the location of the bodies in the Babes in the Wood murders in 1970.

It was later renamed to its current name in mid-2017. The party's Secretary-General is Faiq Al Sheikh Ali, an Iraqi liberal secular politician who has been a member of the Council of Representatives of Iraq since 2014 serving in the Judiciary Committee. History In mid-2011, Sheikh Ali founded the People's Party in London. The party is a Centrist Liberal one whose goals are rebuilding Iraq as a nation, establishing a state of justice and social guarantees, as well as establishing the principle of loyalty to Iraq and fighting underdevelopment & corruption. Article 39(a) in the Iraqi constitution states that the freedom to form and join associations and political parties is guaranteed and shall be regulated by law. In 2015, Sheikh Ali helped pass the Political Parties Acthttp://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/102986/124758/F1240401810/4383.pdf which had not been legislated since the constitution was passed in 2005. A day before the vote, Sheikh Ali wrote on his Facebook page: 'Today we ended the most complex law in the history of Iraq and most contrary and controversy between the political blocs and parties over many years. We (four members of parliament) left the Parliament after preparing the Act to a vote tomorrow. It may not satisfy all our ambitions and everything we aspired to, but it achieves many of them, which is the last we could reach through discussions. The Act organises the provisions and procedures related to the establishment of political parties. It established a department for the political parties and organisations in the Electoral Commission in which a request had to be submitted listing not less than seven founding members of the party and a list of at least 2000 members from different Iraqi governorates, taking into account the representation of women.http://www.nrttv.com/ar/Detail.aspx?Jimare=9228 In mid-2017, the party registered at the department for political parties and organisations and amended its name to the People's Party for Reform. It set out its new political program after expanding to include a number of provincial council and parliamentary members such as Basra MP Mohammed Al-Tai and Nineveh MP Ahmed Al-Jubouri who announced the party's founding conference in Baghdad, stating that the party will contribute to real change and reform. Party founding conference On Monday, 20 November 2017, the founding conference of the party was held in Baghdad's Great Hall with the presence of 339 former members registered with the electoral commission who are entitled to vote, 311 new members and 307 guests, representing a total of 957 women and men. The 2-hour conference consisted of reading the political program and internal rules of the party, before nine members of the party were elected to represent the party's leadership. The nine members then held a meeting on the podium in the presence of the Commission, wrote a memorandum signed to distribute the tasks and responsibilities and elect each member in accordance with the party's rules of procedure, and handed the record to the head of the Political Parties Department for approval by the Commission. The party seeks to address all Iraqis regardless of their religion or ideological affiliation and has stated that it will participate strongly in the upcoming elections of May-2018. 2014 Parliamentary Elections The party participated in the April 2014 Iraqi parliamentary election, as part of the Civil Democratic Alliance an Iraqi political coalition formed in 2013 by various civil parties. The party won one of the three seats of the coalition in Baghdad Governorate. It is represented by its Secretary-General, who arrived sixth in the Baghdad Governorate out of more than 3000 candidates,http://www.ihec.iq/ihecftp/ntaij2014/Complete.pdf receiving 24,256 votes.http://ihec.iq/ihecftp/ntaij2014/baghdad.pdf 2018 Parliamentary Elections After the Civil Democratic Alliance split in December-2017 into two alliances, the current consisting of mostly left-wing leaning parties who stayed as part of the alliance, a second alliance called the Civilized Alliance (Arabic: ÿ™ÿ≠ÿßŸÑŸÅ ÿ™ŸÖÿØŸëŸÜ) was formed in January-2018, consisting of four centrist liberal national parties. The new alliance is led by Faiq Al Sheikh Ali and includes his party, the National Civil Movement of MP Shirouk Al Abayachi, the Iraqi National Movement and the Al-Etifak National Party as well as a number of known independent figures. The alliance aims to establish a civil state based on justice and equal rights & duties for all citizens adopting liberal principles characterized by free & fair elections, separation of powers and the rule of law, ensuring equal protection of human rights, and civil & political freedoms for all.

She held a patent for the converging diverging variable exhaust nozzle. The invention operated so that one would vary both the throat and the exit diameters for the hot gas flows. In honor of her legacy, the Society of Women Engineers named a scholarship after her. To date, that scholarship is still being distributed to eligible female graduate students who pursue a career in engineering. Bailey was the first female member of the Engineering Society of Cincinnati. She later served as the chair of its Guidance Committee. Early life Bailey was the youngest of five children. She excelled in math and science in high school. Although her father was a civil engineer, it was her oldest sister Helen and her husband Paul who influenced Bailey to choose a career in engineering. Paul sold welding machines and taught Helen to weld. Helen taught welding to various men and women during World War II. Although a number of Helen's female welding students scored higher than the male students, all of the men were placed first before the women, regardless of the score. So, between Betty Lou Bailey's junior and senior years in high school, Helen suggested that Betty Lou should go into engineering. Education Bailey attended the undergraduate program in mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois a year early, at the age of seventeen. By the time she finished her freshman year, both of Bailey's parents had died. In 1950, Bailey graduated with University Honors. In her graduating class of approximately 700 engineers, she was the only female engineer. In her sorority, she was one out of a total of two engineers (the other one was a civil engineer). In 1967, she graduated from the Penn State Graduate Center in King of Prussia with a Masters in the Engineering Science. Personal life and death Bailey was an active environmentalist. She enjoyed sewing. She traveled, canoed, cycled, and hiked. She walked the entire Appalachian Trail in segments over a few years. She was a member of the Adirondack Mountain Club (ADK). In 2004 she received their highest award for her work in monitoring hydropower applications to the Federal Regulatory Commission. She did work in dam-licensing that helped ensure that sufficient water was released downstream to support river life and water recreation. Bailey died suddenly on November 13, 2007, during an ADK cycling trip. Career and contributions Bailey held positions at General Electric Company as a testing, design, and systems engineer in their Large Jet Engine Department, Gas Turbine Department, and its Valley Forge Space Technology Center. She progressed in her work, from household appliances, to steam turbines and jet engineers, and finally to the NASA Nimbus weather satellite project. During her initial job interview with GE, which occurred before she graduated from the University of Illinois, she remarked that, \\"I wanted to work for a company where engineers counted and were regarded as important.\\" In addition to her work, Bailey started a math tournament in Cincinnati for high school students. Exhaust nozzle During her tenure at General Electric, Bailey patented an exhaust nozzle in Evendale. She initiated the format that GE used for getting bids on their air emission tests. The company had the 7F gas turbine, which was the first-of-its-kind. She was working at the roof of the building and was familiar with enough with the piping to recognize a leak out of the gas line from the gas valve compartment. The company was losing a lot of gas that had already been counted as going into the turbine. Bailey noted the failed efficiency. That gas leak was going into the incoming gas in the machine, so the carbon monoxide was destroying the seal. All six weeks of prior combustion tests that the employees had been running on the machine had to be discarded. Her invention straightened out the problem, and they passed the tests after that. This was important because the company's gas turbine was the first of its kind and would therefore need to pass all of its tests. Societies In 1964, Bailey attended the first International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists Conference in New York. Bailey joined the Society of Women Engineers in 1951, where she was an officer of the Philadelphia section and served on the SWE Executive Committee. In 1985, she was elected to the SWE College of Fellows. She was the first female member of the Engineering Society of Cincinnati and served as the chair of its Guidance Committee. She has also served on national committees for the National Society of Professional Engineers, the Engineers Joint Council, and the American Society for Engineering Education.

It is an entry in the EA Sports PGA Tour franchise, and was the first series since 1999 not to feature Tiger Woods as its namesake, replacing him with Rory McIlroy. The game was re-built from scratch as part of its shift to eighth generation consoles, adopting DICE's Frostbite 3 engine (primarily used for the Battlefield franchise) due to its graphical fidelity and ability to handle courses as large-scale maps (as opposed to having an individual map for each hole). Additionally, the game introduces new swing modes and assists, Golf Channel personalities and in-game presentation, and an arcade-style challenge mode. Rory McIlroy PGA Tour received mixed reviews; although critics acknowledged the game's increased graphics quality and realism over previous installments in the franchise, the game was criticized primarily for its regressions over previous entries in the franchise, including a small number of available courses on launch, and the removal of various modes and features that had been present in previous PGA Tour games (however, additional courses, and some of these missing features, were added back in subsequent updates). Development Electronic Arts' PGA Tour franchise was placed on a hiatus following its 2013 release, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14; in October 2013, EA announced that the game would also be the final installment in the series co- branded with Tiger Woods, and that he would be replaced by a new title golfer for its next edition. At EA's E3 press conference in June 2014, the company presented footage of the next game in the series under the working title EA Sports PGA Tour. In March 2015, Rory McIlroy became a new title athlete, naming the game Rory McIlroy PGA Tour. It was scheduled to be released in June 2015, before being delayed to July 14, 2015. Unlike other recent EA Sports titles, which were unified around the Ignite engine, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour utilizes the Frostbite 3 engine, originally developed by DICE for the Battlefield franchise. The Frostbite engine allows an entire course to be rendered all at once on a single map, rather than on a hole-by-hole basis‚Äîreducing loading times between holes. Executive producer Brent Nielsen explained that Frostbite 3 was tailored towards \\"creating complex, lifelike environments\\", and that it allowed the team to \\"recreate some of the world's most beautiful courses, as well as create some new ideas of our own.\\" Producer Ryan Ferwerda explained that the changes necessitated a complete rebuild of the game from scratch. Rory McIlroy PGA Tour features Golf Channel in-game presentation. Golf Channel analysts Rich Lerner and Frank Nobilo replaced CBS Sports' Jim Nantz and David Feherty as the game's commentators. Gameplay Rory McIlroy PGA Tour contains some new features, assists and gameplay changes. New Backswing Meter, Aiming Arc, and putt read features were added to assist players in making accurate shots. Three main swing modes are offered; \\"Arcade\\", which uses the analog sticks to swing and allows application of spin to the ball in mid-air, the traditional \\"3-Click\\", and \\"Tour\\"‚Äîan advanced mode similar to Arcade mode, but with no assists enabled at all and higher sensitivity. Players can toggle individual assists to customize their experience. The new engine provides more realistic physics and interactions between the ball and aspects of the environment, such as accounting for firmness and grass length, and shooting balls through plants and trees. As an entire course is now treated as a single map, errant shots can also land and be played from areas that were previously considered out-of-bounds and incurred penalties. A new mode, Night Club Challenge, requires players to make shots at targets in a nightclub-inspired setting. Some features were removed in comparison to PGA Tour 14; amateur (aside from a Web.com Tour event for earning the player's PGA Tour membership) and women's events were removed, as well as certain alternate modes (such as Stableford scoring) beyond stroke and match play, the ability to play individual or certain types of holes (only back 9, front 9, or 18 can be played), online Country Clubs Quick Tournament, weather, and career schedules. =Courses= Rory McIlroy PGA Tour includes eight real-world courses on-disc; Bay Hill, Chambers Bay, the Old Course at St. Andrews, Royal Troon, TPC Boston, TPC Sawgrass, Whistling Straits, and Wolf Creek. TPC Scottsdale was a pre-order exclusive. Additional courses will be added through downloadable content. Four fantasy courses are also offered, including one based on the Battlefield 4 map Paracel Storm, the Grand Canyon, and a nightclub-themed course for the game's new challenge mode. Due to an expired license, Augusta National and the Masters Tournament do not appear in the game, although an EA representative has suggested that the course may be re-introduced as DLC in the future.  Updates  Free updates have been released to add additional features to the game. TPC Scottsdale, East Lake Golf Club, the fantasy course Treasure Island, and Quail Hollow Club were added in August, September, October, and November 2015, respectively. The Quail Hollow update re-introduced alternate shot, best ball, four ball, and skins play. Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson were also added as playable characters in October and November 2015 respectively. PGA West Stadium Course was added in January 2016. In March 2016, Oakmont Country Club (host of the 2016 U.S. Open) was added, as well as additional commentary dialogue in relation to it. An update in May 2016 added Banff Springs, a recurring course from previous PGA Tour games. The update also introduced changes to the behavior of majors in career mode, which now alternate between one of two included courses that had recently hosted it, such as Chambers Bay (2015) and Oakmont for the U.S. Open, St. Andrews (2015) and Royal Troon (2016) for the Open Championship, and Whistling Straits (2015) and Quail Hollow (2017) for the PGA Championship. Removal from EA Access EA removed the game from the EA Access service, the Xbox Store, and PSN on May 22, 2018. However as of 2020, the game is still available on EA Access. Reception Rory McIlroy PGA Tour received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Polygon gave Rory McIlroy PGA Tour a 6 out of 10; the game was praised for the improvements brought by its new engine (including its visual appearance, short loading times, and ball physics), the new putting system, its career progression, which now allowed players to \\"[deepen their] package of abilities instead of forcing him or her to be pure power, pure accuracy or down the middle\\", \\"lifelike\\" crowds, Golf Channel commentators that were \\"much more conversational than the wooden and overacted delivery of Jim Nantz\\", albeit somewhat repetitive. The game was criticized for its lack of courses and events (with only two of the Men's majors represented, and the removal of LPGA events and all but one Web.com Tour event), limited character creation options, as well as the removal of features that were present in previous editions of the PGA Tour franchise. The challenge mode was considered fun, but not comparable to modes in previous installments that focused on the history of golf. As a result, Polygon concluded that Rory McIlroy PGA Tour was \\"a smooth-playing game of golf, which makes the inability to use its new gameplay on the old features fans loved even more regrettable.\\" IGN was similarly negative, giving the game a 5.5 out of 10; although praising the new swing modes and assists for allowing players to customize gameplay to better suit their play style, and the new Frostbite engine for being \\"appreciably superior than the links of the last generation‚Äîeven if some of the textures are a little flat and a lot of the course features tend to pop in around the path of the ball's flight\\", Rory McIlroy PGA Tour was criticized for its lack of content and the removal of features that were present in previous installments of EA Sports' PGA Tour franchise. The lack of features was most apparent in career mode, which saw the removal of bonus objectives, practice rounds, career schedules and the trophy room among others, joking that \\"if a professional career in golf was really this unrewarding and directionless, Rory McIlroy would probably have set his sights on a Masters in Accounting rather than the one in Augusta.\\" They concluded that \\"concessions are often made when sports games straddle the gap between console generations old and new, but considering the two year wait for a game that is only being released on current-gen hardware, the rampant slash and burn of its feature set is particularly galling. EA Tiburon has managed to create a golf game with plenty of holes in it; just not the kind that fans will relish.\\" References External links *Rory McIlroy PGA Tour Official Site Category:2015 video games McIlroy McIlroy Category:EA Sports games Category:Frostbite (game engine) games Category:Golf video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games based on real people Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Arizona Category:Video games set in Florida Category:Video games set in Massachusetts Category:Video games set in Scotland Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Rory McIlroy PGA Tour"},{"id":"43029506","text":"Hani Alnakhli (born 14 March 1986) is a Saudi Arabian athlete who competes in disability athletics in the F33 category.

Voters also cast ballots for trustees for the public school board.\\"How Aldermanic Candidates Ran\\", Hamilton Spectator, Tuesday, December 2, 1930, pp. 10. Campaign The 1930 campaign was marked by two major occurrences. The first was the absence of a vote on the city's Hydro Commissioner. Unlike in past elections, voters in Hamilton would not have the option to elect their representative to the publicly owned hydro-electric company for the city due to changes in provincial legislation that created an appointed board of three individuals to replace the single elected office of Commissioner. Attempting to de-politicize the office, Ontario's provincial government abolished the elected position and created a three-person board with appointees to be chosen by Queen's Park, city council, and the mayor.\\"Sam R. Manson is real dark horse\\", Hamilton Spectator, Friday, November 21, 1930, pg. 7. The second event was the surprise nomination of local athlete Sam Manson for a seat on the Board of Control. Unbeknownst to any more than a dozen of Manson's closest friends, his nomination caught the city's local political establishment by surprise. When rumours of a last-minute entry began circulating city hall at 10:00 the morning of Friday, November 21, the city's sitting aldermen and controllers began questioning the city clerk. Refusing to reveal who the candidate was until five minutes before the close of nominations, the city clerk reportedly faced a \\"barrage of questioning\\" from local politicians. Overall, interest in the election of 1930 was low, in part because of the worsening economic situation faced by Hamiltonians due to the Great Depression. The Hamilton Spectator reported that less than 30 people attended the traditional post- nomination speeches by candidates at city hall. Mayor Mayor John Peebles, who had been acclaimed to his first term in 1929, was returned to a second- term by acclamation once more in 1930. In his nomination speech, Peebles spoke at length about the successes of his administration over the previous year, including the opening of McMaster University in Hamilton, improvements to the city's waterworks, and new facilities for the Canadian National Railway.\\"Mayor Peeble's nomination address\\", Hamilton Spectator, Friday, November 21, 1930, pg. 18.

In turn, Star Wars has depicted, inspired, and influenced several futuristic technologies, some of which are in existence and others under development. In the introduction of the Return of the Jedi novelization, George Lucas wrote: \\"Star Wars is also very much concerned with the tension between humanity and technology, an issue which, for me, dates back even to my first films. In Jedi, the theme remains the same, as the simplest of natural forces brought down the seemingly invincible weapons of the evil Empire.\\" While many of these technologies are in existence and in use today, they are not nearly as complex as seen in Star Wars. Some of these technologies are not considered possible at present. Nevertheless, many of the technologies depicted by Star Wars parallel modern real-life technologies and concepts, though some have significant differences. Biotechnology =Cloning and genetic engineering= A fan cosplay of a clone trooper at the 2015 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo. The clone troopers are derived from the DNA of their original host, Jango Fett. Star Wars also depicts the practice of cloning and genetic engineering, though far more advanced and sophisticated than modern scientific and technological standards. Cloning in Star Wars was first mentioned in the original 1977 Star Wars film (A New Hope) and its novelization. It was first seen on film in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones (2002). There are major differences between the current ability to clone humans and those seen in Star Wars. Current human cloning methods need to use the somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), which requires an unfertilized egg from a female donor to its nucleus removed, resulting in an enucleated egg. DNA from the subject being cloned would need to be extracted and electronically fused together with the enucleated egg. A surrogate mother needs to be impregnated with the embryos to give birth to the clone. Cloning in Star Wars does not seem to use this process, and instead depicts advanced machinery that directly processes the human subject's DNA, and produces the clone or clones, by the thousands, if desired. The clones in Star Wars can also be genetically altered during their pre-birth phase to have their growth hormones and learning abilities accelerated, as well as their independence and self-consciousness restricted.Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones According to Jeanne Cavelos, a science-fiction writer and former NASA astrophysicist, who is also author of the book The Science of Star Wars, all of this is future possibility with the progress of science and technology. What is not possible according to her is the ability to accelerate either the growth of clones, or their ability to learn faster. =Regeneration= Submersion in a liquid called bacta causes mutilated flesh to regenerate in the Star Wars universe. According to an in- universe reference book, bacta is a red-hued chemical compound; it must be mixed with a synthetic liquid which mimics bodily fluids. The combined bacterial medium regenerates traumatized flesh and promotes tissue growth. Luke Skywalker was first seen using a bacta tank in The Empire Strikes Back; his father Darth Vader has a similar tank in Rogue One. Clone troopers also use such healing technology in The Clone Wars. Bacta can also be administered in a spray form. =Prosthetics= A modern brain-controlled prosthetic hand and arm co-developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory and the Federal Drug Administration. In Star Wars, prosthetics are first seen on film towards the end of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. The prosthetic limbs seen in the films bear an almost absolute resemblance to natural limbs, in terms of size, shape, and movement. The only distinction is the material that the prosthetic limbs are made of, which differs greatly from the organic material of the natural limbs and other organs that the prosthetic limbs replace. Such precision is not considered possible by current technological means. However, according to recent research and development conducted at the Case Western University, which produced prosthetic limbs similar to the ones seen in Star Wars, the ability for prosthetics to produce feeling has become closer to reality. A similar production, even closer to natural organic limbs, known as the DEKA Arm System and dubbed \\"The Luke\\", after Luke Skywalker's prosthetic arm, was approved for mass production by the US Food and Drug Administration after eight years of testing and development. More recently, scientists have begun to develop artificial skin jackets to cover prosthetic limbs, creating an effect similar to what is seen in the Star Wars films. Body armour Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, April 2015. Fans dressed as Boba Fett and a typical Mandalorian. These fictional body armors have been semi-replicated by scientists for military purposes. Body armour is seen throughout the Star Wars films, television shows and other media. Their main purpose is to protect the wearer from attacks and other hazards as in ancient and current times on Earth. They are most commonly seen on Imperial stormtroopers, clone troopers, bounty hunters and others, providing various levels of protection and other functions. According to Star Wars lore, the armor worn by stormtroopers is generally impervious to projectile weapons and blast shrapnel and can deflect a glancing blow from a blaster but will be punctured by a direct hit. Meanwhile the traditional armor worn by Mandalorians, made from the fictional material known as beskar, is capable of repelling a lightsaber. Major characters in the Star Wars franchise are also known for wearing body armor. The bounty hunter Boba Fett wore modified body armor fitted with various gadgets like his predecessor, Jango Fett. This armor has multi-purpose tactical abilities along with many scraps and dents which Fett wears with pride.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 279 Darth Vader wears an armored suit which protects him in combat as well as provides life-support functions for his badly burned body.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 278 Such type of armor has slowly begun to become a scientific reality. In 2016, ballistic and body armor company, AR500, in collaboration with Heckler & Koch produced body armor modelled after the iconic villain, Boba Fett. Carbonite freezing Carbonite freezing in Star Wars is first seen on film in The Empire Strikes Back and also equally mentioned in its novelization, where Darth Vader and The Empire place Han Solo in a carbonite casing. Its usage and reverse is also seen in The Empire Strikes Back and its sequel, Return of the Jedi. Carbonite freezing is based on the concept of cryonics, which involves freezing a living organism to keep it in suspended animation. The technology is still being researched and developed by scientists into a more sophisticated form. Carbonite exists in real life as a type of gunpowder. According to professor James H. Fallon, the carbonite used in Star Wars might be a \\"dry ice\\" with an opposite charge. He further speculates that it is a form of carbon dioxide mineral, which, like in cryonics, is kept at very low temperatures, to the point that there is no need for oxygen or blood-flow. This could keep living organisms and living tissue in suspended animation. While the freezing process as depicted in the films is realistic, reversing the same process by heating, he argues, is more challenging, and can be dangerous if heated too fast. He also argues that this process, as depicted in the film, is a scientific, physical challenge. Computers and other artificial intelligence Aside from droids/robots, the use of artificial intelligence and computers is found very commonly in the Star Wars universe. Computing technology exists in many different forms in both the Star Wars movies and other media, with the capacity to process large volumes of data every millisecond and store it for safekeeping. Examples include simple viewscreens that receive and display information; scanners which examine an object, interpret the collected data and present it to the user; and datapads, portable computers (often handheld) which allow individuals to access and interpret information.Barr, et al. (2017), p. 150-151 An example of computing devices which perform very complex tasks in the Star Wars franchise are navigational computers, also called nav computers or navicomputers, which form a key part of many Star Wars spacecraft. Such computers are said to store vast libraries of astrogation knowledge and work with their ships' sensors and hyperdrive to plot safe courses in real-space and hyperspace. Source material makes it clear that only the desperate or foolhardy would attempt traveling in hyperspace without an up-to-date navcomputer as a ship can easily smash into a hazard without one. Some small Star Wars spacecraft (such as the X-wing) use an astromech droid in place of a navcomputer due to size restrictions.Windham (2018), p. 56-58Windham (2019), p. 55 A unique form of data storage found in the Star Wars universe is the Holocron, a type of artifact used by both Jedi and Sith to store vital and sensitive knowledge, usually concerning the Force. Holocrons resemble evenly- proportioned polyhedrons and typically store information in the form of holographic lessons. Many will only permit access to someone who is sensitive in the Force, and for additional security may require a separate memory crystal in order to activate.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 264 More mundane forms of data storage exist in the Star Wars franchise, though some have tremendous capacity. The IGV-55 Surveillance Vessel, a class of Imperial spy ship seen in the Star Wars Rebels television series, possess a massive database that can store billions of yottabytes of data.Walker (2018), p. 164 In a 2016 article for TechCrunch, contributor Evaldo H. de Oliveira estimated the amount of data needed to manage the Death Star was in excess of 40,000 yottabytes. This included an estimate that the Death Star's crew would generate 8.84 exabytes per year, with an additional 2.08 exabytes generated per year by its droid population. An example of multi-purpose artificial intelligence is seen in moisture vaporators, devices that produce water from hydrogen and oxygen in the air. These are first seen on film on the planet Tatooine in A New Hope. Their artificial intelligence is more basic than most other forms of artificial intelligence seen in the Star Wars universe, dealing with input from humidity and air density sensors. They use this input to help them take samples from the air and produce water. They also require input from robots. The film also shows Owen Lars, Luke's uncle, telling C-3PO that he needs a droid that can really understand the language of moisture vaporators, with the droid claiming that it's in his programming.Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Cybersecurity also plays a major role in the films and other media, with many real-world counterparts. The term slicer is the in-universe designation for a hacker in the Star Wars universe, describing individuals such as DJ (Benicio del Toro) from The Last Jedi.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 167 A form of security token is worn by Imperial and First Order officers called a code or access cylinder, which grants them access to restricted areas or databases.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 278 A report analyzing the Empire's cyber security systems used in Rogue One, in which IT experts were consulted, made a few conclusions. One claim by information systems management professor Hsinchun Chen was that the theft of digital architectural designs are a common phenomenon in real life. He concludes that software breaches should not just be resisted, as in the case of Star Wars, but successfully prevented by taking security measures far prior to any attempted attacks. Corey Nachreiner in a 2017 GeekWire article also examined some of the lessons in cybersecurity offered by Rogue One. This include the need to safeguard the Internet of Things represented by the droid character K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) and the need for strong multi-factor authentication. Cybernetics A fanmade replica costume of General Grievous, whose entire body is mechanical According to Webster's dictionary, cybernetics is defined as: \\"the science of communication and control theory that is concerned especially with the comparative study of automatic control systems (as the nervous system and brain and mechanical-electrical communication systems)\\". Cybernetics are used to replace organic body parts at a deeper and more complex level than prosthetics. Prosthetics are still connected to nervous systems through organic tissue, and still rely on nervous systems for functioning. Cybernetics, however, replace entire nervous systems as well as damaged tissue, internal organs, and other body parts that can no longer be used for an organic being to function properly. The use of cybernetics in Star Wars is documented by much of the Star Wars media, including novels, comics, and television series. It is used by characters for both enhancements and replacements for damaged or destroyed body parts. In the films, it is most recognizably used on two major characters: General Grievous and Darth Vader, both whom are cyborgs. Its applications are also first seen on film in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith. Darth Vader, previously Anakin Skywalker, lost one of his limbs starting in the Clone Wars, and later, towards the end of the Clone Wars, lost most of his limbs after a deadly lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi. Shortly after the duel, he was caught in the heat range of molten lava, resulting in the burning and melting of much of his flesh and tissue.Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Vader lost many of his nervous and sensory systems, most of which were replaced by prosthetics, bionics, and, later, cybernetics. Besides having cybernetic limbs, Vader wore a suit equipped with cybernetic systems, both to help him function, and to protect his damaged body from exposure. His belt included high and low range audio sensors. The belt also included respiratory and temperature regulation adjustment controls. Vader's neural functions were also regulated by neuro sensors, located towards the back of his helmet. Additionally, to help him see, breathe, and maintain cognition, Vader's helmet was equipped with enhanced visual sensors, body heat vents, and neural function sensors. Vader's internal oxygen, blood, and nutrient flows, as well as nervous systems, were regulated by the control plate on his chest. His muscular system was enhanced by a neuro-electrical nervous pulse system in his cybernetic suit, giving him amplified physical strength. Scientists and scientific commentators have suggested that Vader lost his lungs by inhaling air in extreme temperatures within the heat range of lava on the planet Mustafar, causing damage to his lung tissue. This would require the need for a filter mask to take in more purified oxygen, as well as replacement lungs, most of which are possible by modern scientific and technological means. A peer reviewed journal by two Danish physicians concluded that Darth Vader's suit acts as a wearable hyperbaric chamber, which supports his supposedly chronically injured lungs. It also protects his damaged and vulnerable skin from infection. In a study on the breakdown of Vader's breathing habits, one of the two physicians concluded that the suit would not be their top preference, but rather that lung transplantation would be a better choice. General Grievous's body is almost entirely cybernetic. Animation director Rob Coleman explained that Grievous was made with technological flaws, and experienced difficulties such as poor maneuverability and coughing, the latter caused by his lungs constantly filling with liquid. His mechanical body did, however, give him advantages in combat, due to being made of solid material, instead of organic bones and limbs. Grievous's organic body being destroyed in conflict left him with only a brain, eyes, and internal organs, which scientists placed in a constructed cybernetic body. Anatomy and neurobiology professor James H. Fallon of the University of California explains that one problem with this type of cybernetic body is the lack of knowledge in brain circuitry coding, which has yet to be decrypted. Fallon argues that most prosthetic and cybernetic technology in Star Wars is still plausible with continuous research and development in the relevant fields. Energy technology The Imperial TIE Fighter (artist's render on the left) using the same concept of solar-based energy for ion propulsion as NASA craft Deep Space 1 (right) by the use of solar panelsStar Wars Tech (2007 documentary). Reference material identifies a number of different methods by which energy is created in the Star Wars universe. Examples of power sources used for domestic devices include chemical, fission and fusion. In Star Wars spacecraft and other large structures, fusion reactors powered by the fictional \\"hypermatter\\" fuel are considered the most common source of energy.Windham (2018), p. 96 Solar power technology is a method of energy generation used mainly by the Imperial TIE fighter, which features in many Star Wars films and other media. According to the TIE Fighter Owner's Workshop Manual, these spacecraft are fitted with two hexagonal wings that have six trapezoidal solar arrays on both sides which collect energy from nearby stars and use it to power the fighter's ion engines.Windham (2019), p. 20-21 Another Star Wars ship noted for using solar power is the solar sailer piloted by Count Dooku (Christoper Lee) in Attack of the Clones and other media. It deploys a solar sail wide which captures interstellar energy in order to travel without requiring fuel.Walker (2018), p. 127Barr, et al. (2019), p. 303 An electron transfer experiment conducted by scientists in 2005 involved a supramolecular TIE fighter ship design. It is unclear whether the experiment managed to achieve the desired results or not. Force fields The use of force fields in the Star Wars universe is documented both in the main films of the Star Wars saga and in spin-off media, such as The Clone Wars, as well as other media adaptations. According to reference material, protective force fields used to defend starships, buildings, armies and other objects from attack are known as deflector shields and come in two main types. Particle shields repel solid objects such as space debris or high-velocity projectiles. Ray shields (or energy shields) repel radiation, lasers, blasters and other energy-based attacks. Deflector shields which envelop an object can either be generated by it or be projected onto it from another location.Barr, et al. (2017), p. 133Windham (2018), p. 82-83 Deflector fields come in many different sizes and varieties in the Star Wars universe, as seen in the films and explained in background literature. Droidekas, which made their theatrical appearance in The Phantom Menace, are equipped with deflector shields that are polarized to allow their own blaster bolts to pass through while stopping any fire coming from outside.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 53 In The Empire Strikes Back a shield system protects the Rebels' Echo Base on Hoth. Projected by modules studded throughout the surrounding territory and powered by a central generator, only slow-moving ground-contact vehicles (such as Walkers) can penetrate the shield.Lund, et al. (2016), p. 142 The incomplete Death Star II is protected remotely via deflector shield generator located on the Forest Moon of Endor in Return of the Jedi. Identified as a SLD-26 Planetary Shield Generator, it can envelop a small moon (or large space station) with a nearly impenetrable shield for an indefinite period of time.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 283 In Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the tropical planet Scarif is completely enveloped in a deflector shield to prevent anyone from landing or leaving the planet without Imperial authorization except by a single shield gate.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 223 Many Star Wars spacecraft and starfighters are said to possess generators which create both types of deflector shields around them to protect against normal space travel and enemy attacks. Smaller vessels may only have a single deflector shield generator which can be adjusted to protect specific parts of the ship, while larger vessels may have multiple generators each protecting a specific area. Large starships with hanger bays will also employ another type of force field called a magnetic shield. These are activated whenever the hanger's blast doors are opened, retaining a pressurized atmosphere within the bay while allowing smaller vessels to come and go. The Gungans are described in Star Wars sources employing unique hydrostatic field generators to create their underwater bubble cities as seen in The Phantom Menace. This same technology is used to make defensive shields for their army, from small handheld versions that can deflect solid objects and blasters to large generators carried on fictional Fambaa creatures. These generators can envelop an area as wide as one kilometre in a protective bubble which will stop weapons fire but not battle droids from marching through the perimeter.Lund, et al. (2016), p. 20-21, 52Barr, et al. (2017), p. 171Luceno , et al. (2018), p. 75 In 2014, physics students at the University of Leicester developed a module of plasma-based deflector shields, inspired by the ones in Star Wars and other science fiction stories. However, the field poses some issues. One issue is that the deflector shield would have to be much stronger to repel than to hold the plasma in position. Another is that the shield would deflect electromagnetic energy, including light. This would make it impossible for someone inside the shield to see anything. In 2015, the American megacorporation Boeing built plasma-based force fields, similar in size and dimensions to the force fields used in Star Wars ground battles. Like the ground force fields in the Star Wars films, these shields cannot block or repel solid matter, but are instead built to protect vehicles from the force of explosions. Gravity technology Technology which allows for the manipulation of gravity is a common feature in the Star Wars films and other media. Examples include the use of tractor beams, force fields which envelop an object and manipulate it remotely, and repulsorlifts, which push against a planet's gravity to create lift. Artificial gravity and inertial dampeners are also used on Star Wars spacecraft, protecting their occupants from the crushing gravitational forces of high-speed maneuvers or when landing on a high-gravity world.Windham (2018), p. 83 =Repulsorlift= Although the Malloy hoverbike may appear very similar to a Star Wars hoverbike in terms of size, shape and performance, its input and levitation is by air propulsion with the use of turbofans as opposed to a Star Wars hoverbike which uses anti- gravity \\"repulsorlift\\" engines. Levitation is depicted throughout the Star Wars films, as well as in most other spin-off media of the franchise. Levitation in Star Wars is primarily caused by a type of anti-gravity technology known within the setting as a \\"repulsorlift engine.\\" According to in-universe material, a fusion-powered repulsorlift or 'antigrav' creates a field of negativity gravity that pushes against the natural gravitational field of a planet. Terrestrial vehicles such as landspeeders and speeder bikes use this technology to propel themselves across a planet's surface. Repulsorlifts are also used by spacecraft as secondary engines for atmospheric flight and planetary landings and take-offs. Other vehicles that utilize repulsorlift engines include Jabba the Hutt's sail barge and snowspeeders. Many droids and robots also use this technology to hover and move above a planet's surface, such as the Imperial Probe Droid. The carbonite freezing coffin that kept Han Solo in suspension was suspended in midair using a gravity repulsion force field. Levitation by this method is currently considered a physical impossibility by today's means. Despite being a current scientific impossibility, research on such concepts are still being hypothesized and exercised by scientists today, with occasional minor breakthroughs. Magnetic levitation already exists in modern times, but with fundamental differences from levitation seen in Star Wars. An example of vehicles that maintain constant levitation without the use of constant propulsion is the Maglev train. The Maglev train stays afloat by using the magnetic repulsion of like charges, but relies on the surface that it travels above, in its case, the train tracks, to have the same charge as its own coils, resulting in a magnetic repulsion. One possibility for magnetic levitation as seen in Star Wars is suggested by physics associate professor Micheal Denin. According to him, if a planet was made out of the right magnetic materials, such as iron or nickel, the vehicle could then produce a repulsive charge, allowing it to lift above the surface. In 2010, Australian inventor and engineer Chris Malloy constructed a hoverbike that uses turbofans to enter flight. It is claimed to fly up to 10,000 feet and fly at a horizontal speed of 173 miles an hour. The hoverbike has been repeatedly compared to the hoverbikes seen in the Star Wars films. It is unclear, however, whether these hoverbikes were actually inspired by Star Wars or not. Another fundamental difference, besides their power sources, is that the hoverbikes in Star Wars can only climb a few meters above the ground, unlike the current ones being developed.Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Malloy's company, Malloy Aeronotics, is reported to have partnered with an American-based company for further experimenting, as well as developing Malloy's hoverbikes for the US military. =Tractor beams= A tractor beam is described as an invisible force field that can grab, trap, suspend, and move objects with force. According to Star Wars sources, tractor beams generators and projectors are common components on many spacecraft, with both military and civilian applications. Tractor beams can be used to move cargo, tow disabled vessels, or assist in docking maneuvers. They can also be used offensively to slow down or immobilize an opponent, though targeting fast and maneuverable ships can be challenging.Barr, et al (2019), p. 263Windham (2018), p. 85 Scientists have explored the concept of tractor beams, having some success since the early 2010s. In that time, they have managed to produce lasers with unusual intensity-beam profiles that allow them to attract and repel tiny particles. Some breakthroughs include the successful project of a team of science researchers from the Australian National University, who managed to produce a doughnut shaped laser that can drag hollow glass spheres by a distance of roughly 7.8 inches, several times the distance of previous experiments. Another successful experiment was conducted at the University of Bristol, which revealed that sound could be manipulated to produce possible future tractor beams, rivaling light. This could be done using a precisely timed sequence of sound waves, produced by tiny loudspeakers, creating a limited space with low pressure that can counteract gravity and levitate objects. Holography A 3D graphic illustration of a Star Wars style hologram. Holography in Star Wars was first seen on film in the fourth film of the saga Episode IV: A New Hope. Holographs were used for various purposes, mainly communication. At the time of the release of the original Star Wars films, holographic technology in 3D format, as seen in the films, was not available. Neowin reports that research conducted by Microsoft has brought about the creation of 3D holographic technology. The technology is intended be used for various purposes, such as plotting data on maps. ExtremeTech reports that smartphones created at HP labs are now bringing 3D holographic technology from Star Wars closer to reality. More recently, Fox News reported that Australian National University students were close to developing Star Wars- style holograms. A researcher for the project said that the material the device consists of will be transparent and used in a wide range of applications, as well as ‚Äúcomplex manipulations with light.‚Äù. Interstellar travel In the Star Wars universe, two different types of fictional propulsion exist to allow starships to travel in space and across the galaxy: sublight drives and hyperdrives.Barr, et al. (2017), p. 132 Sublight drives propel starships at below the speed of light and are used upon leaving a planet's atmosphere and during space battles. Many different varieties of sublight drives or sublight engines exist, but the most common are electromagnetic propulsion types like ion engines which release charged particles to propel the ship forward. Ion engines also lack moving parts and high-temperature components, making them easier to maintain.Windham (2018), p. 70Windham (2019), p. 26 Sublight drives can propel Star Wars vessels clear of a planet's atmosphere and gravity in a matter of minutes. The hyperdrive allows Star Wars spaceships to travel between stars by transporting them into another dimension, known as hyperspace, in which objects with mass are capable of traveling faster than the speed of light. The in-universe explanation for how hyperdrives function is that they utilize supralight 'hypermatter' particles (such as coaxium) to launch ships into hyperspace at faster-than- light speeds without changing their complex mass/energy configuration. Hyperdrives are categorized by class, with the lower class indicating higher speed.Windham (2018), p. 68 Although empty, hyperspace is coterminous with 'realspace' and permeated by \\"mass shadows\\" created by realspace objects. Any object in hyperspace colliding with one of these mass shadows is destroyed, so in order to navigate safely, starships must utilize navigational computers (or navicomputers) to calculate a safe route through hyperspace.Windham (2018), p. 56-59 Thanks to hyperdrive technology, Star Wars ships can cover interstellar distances which would normally requires thousands of years in a matter of hours. Deep Space 1 was the first NASA's spacecraft to use ion propulsions, with comparisons made directly between it and the Empire's TIE Fighter. According to NASA, while their means of propulsion were the same, advances in power generation would be needed to in order to develop an ion engine as powerful as those used on TIE fighters. The space probe Dawn also uses ion propulsion, although unlike the TIE fighter it was fitted with three instead of just two. In an examination of the amount of force generated by Star Wars sublight engines, Rhett Allain, associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, looked at the scene of a Hammerhead corvette ramming one Imperial Star Destroyer into another during the final space battle of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. He argues that the Hammerhead's engines would had to have exerted (or 200 billion) Newtons in order to push the Star Destroyer. This would make them 6,000 times more powerful than a Saturn V rocket. Radios and other communications devices In Star Wars, a subspace transceiver, also known as a subspace comm, subspace radio, and hypertransceiver, was a standard device used for instantaneous, faster-than- light communications between nearby systems. Similar to its shorter-ranged cousin, the comlink, the subspace transceiver relied on energy to broadcast signals. Starships carried these units to broadcast distress signals and other important messages. They used subspace as the communications medium. The subspace transceiver of an Imperial Star Destroyer had a range of 100 light- years. Devices for shorter-range communications, such as the comlink, can be either hand-held (as seen in A New Hope) or strapped to the wrist (as seen in The Empire Strikes Back, during the early scenes on the planet Hoth). These devices can also be tuned with encryption algorithms for private communication. Most humanoid droids, such as C-3PO, communicate long distances using these comlinks. Other droids, such as R2-D2 and Imperial Probe Droids, use antennas to transmit/receive messages and signals for longer range communications. Devices for long-range communications within a planet are connected by satellites orbiting the planet. Robotics Star Wars depicts robotics which resembles current robotics technology, though at a much more advanced and developed level. Robotics in Star Wars are generally divided into two categories, as in modern reality: military and civil. =Civil= Agricultural barrel-shaped robots such as the Greenlive Lely Juno play important roles in assisting humans with labor chores (in this case farming) similar to the civilian robots seen in Star Wars. Some robots in the Star Wars universe are capable of performing multiple types of tasks, while others can only perform one type of task. For example, 21-B is built for the sole purpose of performing medical tasks. Others, such as humanoid protocol droids like C-3PO, are built for multiple purposes. These range from basic physical chores to translating between different forms of communication, including with sophisticated computers and other forms of artificial intelligence. Other, barrel-shaped robots, such as R2-D2, are built with multiple features and capabilities. These include repairing and programming advanced devices, as well as maintaining them. The basic concepts and purposes for robotics in Star Wars, as in real life, are to reduce human labor, assist humans with sophisticated requirements, as well as store and manage complex information. Another parallel to the modern world is the use of robots in Star Wars for tasks not considered safe or acceptable for humans. Robots are also seen as a source of cutting human labor costs. The Japanese radio control manufacturer Nikko developed a toy robot version of R2-D2, with more limited abilities than the R2-D2 has in the Star Wars films. The toy can respond to a small number of verbal commands. Most of the robot's operations must be done manually, due to its limited abilities. A related development is the creation of the droid BB-8 for the film Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens (made by different manufacturers). In the film, BB-8 is a semi-automated robot, operated by remote control, unlike C-3PO (played by Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (played by Kenny Baker), who were portrayed by actual actors. The BB-8 toy is operated by remote control, but it also has some independent features, and shares its manner of movement and other features with the film's BB-8. In 2010, NASA developed robots inspired by the hovering remote-controlled droids, seen in the Star Wars films and other media, and used by the Jedi for lightsaber combat training. These robots were used in NASA space stations for experimentation. Also in 2010, a hacker developed similar robots, but only capable of floating beyond a limited magnetic range. =Military= Front view illustration of an Atlas robot developed by Boston Dynamics (now owned by Google) in co-operation with an agency of the United States Department of Defense. Military robots in the Star Wars universe are built on the same principles as modern military robotics. While most military robots in the modern world are designed in various shapes, depending on their purpose, the military robots of the Star Wars universe are primarily humanoid, and built to imitate live, organic soldiers, mainly human ones. A major similarity between modern military robotics and those of the Star Wars universe is that different robots are built and designed for different specific purposes, whether those purposes are ground warfare, maritime warfare, aerial warfare, or space warfare, as seen in the Star Wars prequel films. Such uses are considered unpractical and unfeasible by current means, given the sophistication and resources each individual unit would require. Another significant, recognizable distinction of the robots in the Star Wars universe, whether military or civilian, is their strong sense of independence and self- awareness, compared to current robots. This is mainly due to Star Wars robots having much more advanced sensors and self-computing systems than current robots do. Despite the limited abilities of current robots, Dr. Jonathan Roberts, director of CSTRO Autonomous Systems Laboratory, proclaims that the role of robots in assisting humans is going to increase, similarly to what is seen in Star Wars. The Christian Science Monitor reported in 2011 that an American blogger, out of patriotism, tried to raise money to build a robotic AT-AT for the US military. Heikko Hoffman, a robotics expert from HRL Laboratories, who was not associated with the project, claims that AT-ATs are possible, though some of their designs should be changed from those seen in the Star Wars universe, for safety, and for financial and operational costs. The project, though not terminated, was suspended, due to copyright concerns from Lucasfilm. In 2012, the United States Navy built a robot modeled after C-3PO, but appears to function for both military and civilian purposes. Macro-engineering Examples of Macro-engineering on vast scales feature prominently in the Star Wars films and other medias. The most famous example is the Death Star from the original Star Wars film. A giant battle station which is said to be in diameter, it was built in secret over a twenty year period and operated with a crew of over one million.Walker (2018), p. 204Barr, et al. (2019), p. 236-237 The Death Star II which appears in Return of the Jedi is even larger at in diameter.Walker (2018), p. 205 In The Force Awakens, the First Order unveils Starkiller Base, a planetoid in diameter which has been transformed into a mobile weapons platform.Lund, et al. (2016), p. 11Barr, et al. (2019), p. 240-241 The flagship of the First Order that appears in The Last Jedi, the Supremacy, is a Mega-class Star Destroyer wide and a crew of over two million.Walker (2018), p. 202Barr, et al. (2019), p. 341 As part of a team project, a group of students at LeHigh University in 2012 attempted to determine the cost and time needed to build a Death Star. They determined that the amount of steel alone needed to build a Death Star was (or 1.08 quadrillion) tons, which at then-current production rates would take 833,315 years and cost $852 quadrillion USD. They also estimated that the total amount of mineable iron ore in the Earth would be enough to build two billion Death Stars. Zachary Feinstein, an assistant professor at Washington University, estimated that the total cost for the first Death Star would amount to $193 quintillion USD. Conversely, he estimated that the cost of building Starkiller Base would be a fraction of that price at $9.315 quintillion USD, but only if it was naturally able to maintain a self- sustaining atmosphere. Other technologies Aside from major technologies, the Star Wars universe also includes technologies that play less important roles with respect to the plot of the stories. =Macrobinoculars= Star Wars Launch Bay Macrobinoculars are hand-held devices that function like binoculars, with the purpose of giving the user the ability to see vast distances. It was first seen on film in A New Hope and mentioned in its novelization. The websites tested.com reports that Sony has developed macrobinoculars comparable to the ones seen in Star Wars, known as DEVs, and produced in separate types of models. These give the user the ability to see great distances clearly and record their sightings.

Bernard Barillot. Bernard Barillot  Biography  After high school in Carcassonne, he entered the Toulouse School of Fine arts in September 1967. He studied under Claude ChaigneauTeacher in the School of Fine Arts of Toulouse and Jacques Fauch√©. He also attended Michel Goedgebuer 's lithography and silk screen printing art studio. He finished his studies in 1974 and was awarded the ‚ÄúGrand prix of the town of Toulouse‚Äù. After much research, BB was busy with bind writing, calligraphy and painting. Sign, Letter and Graphic became obsessional for him. ‚ÄúThe deep mysterious drawing of graphic signs and their powerful evocation draw attract and captivate the attention by means of sensitivity. The plan carries the image slowly, with the fragility of time passing space‚Äù writes Bernard Barillot in his book of artist ‚ÄúThe song of the sign‚Äù. As soon as he had finished at the School of Fine Arts, Bernard Barillot held multiple exhibitions, first in France and then abroad. In 1984 Barillot took part in the exhibition ‚Äú L‚Äôabstraction au carr√©‚Äù (‚Äúthe abstraction squared‚Äù) about the Larzac with Pierre Soulages, Andr√© Marfaing, Charles Pierre Bru, Albert Ayme, Jacques Fauch√©.

He has just prefaced a catalog on his work, ‚ÄúBernard Barillot, le devenir de l‚Äôoeuvre‚Äù (‚ÄúBernard Barillot, the future of the work‚Äù). Two other works followed, the first prefaced by the art critic G√©rard-Georges Lemaire. The next one an artistic book entitled ‚ÄúThe song of the sign‚Äù, entirely printed in 18 colour silk screen printing, with a poem by Serge Pey especially written for the artist ‚ÄúL‚Äô√©criture qui ne se lit pas‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe writing which is not read‚Äù Several other writers, artists, journalists, write texts that accompany his works, Marie Didier, Jean Pierre Mader, Eric Carriere, Helen Ling, Alain Monnier, Marie Paule Peyronnet. Very early in June 2002, Bernard Barillot meets and presents his work to Pierre Restany, Campagne Premi√®re street in Paris, the art critic wishes to follow his approach that he finds interesting. Unfortunately a second meeting would not take place, Pierre Restany dies practically one year later to the day. Very touched by all these texts, the artist will collect them surrounded by reproductions of some of his works of different formats, watercolors, pastels, acrylics, in a reasoned catalog so the publication will take place in spring 2019. Bernard Barillot regularly shows his work in San Francisco in the United States.

History The National Radiator company developed from the earlier Fowler Radiator Company (est. 1894.) which was acquired in 1896 by John and Samuel Waters; after the acquisition the radiator factory was moved from Norristown to Johnstown. In 1902 the company was renamed National Radiator Company. The company expanded, and by the 1920s had plants in Trenton, New Jersey, Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and New Castle, Pennsylvania. On 8 Aug 1927 the National Radiator Corporation of Delaware was established with a capital of $25 million; the new group incorporated the Union Radiator Company, the Gurney Heater Canufacturing company, the Continental Heater Company, the Niagra Radiator and Boiler Company, and the Utica Heating Company. In 1929 the company established an industrial research laboratory. In the early 1930s the company required reorganisation due to debt problems, and was placed into receivership and subsequently re-established. In 1951 a fire at the company's \\"Century\\" plant (Moxham) killed one person, and caused $1 million of damage.

His partner and wife is Julie Alkire, also known as Julie Haus. The first public season of the New York made women's collection was Fall 2012. Along with garment design, Alkire also creates the custom textile prints for the collection. He employs techniques in painting, drawing, graphic design, and photography to produce the prints. In 2018, Alkire was inducted into the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA). He graduated from the University of Houston and was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Career Prior to his fashion designer career, Alkire was an advertising executive and the publisher and creative director of SPOON magazine. The magazine was distributed by Time Warner. Alkire worked with Haus at the publication. She was the editor-in-chief there before she began her fashion career. She is also known for her work on her eponymous line Julie Haus, which Alkire also helped design. Retail business Alkire and Haus opened a retail store in New York City in 2010 dedicated to the Julie Haus label. In 2013, the designers closed the store to open a new atelier type store dedicated to the Haus Alkire collection. That store is located on White Street in the neighborhood of Tribeca in New York City. Creative inspiration The first collection (Autumn/Winter 2012) was shown at New York Fashion Week on February 14, 2012. The designers sought inspiration from the artist Lou Jie and the actress Elsa Martinelli's portrayal of Belle Star in the 1968 film The Belle Star Story. The New York Fashion Week event was held at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. The second collection was inspired by Hana, Hawaii. The designers used images of an imaginary creature along with Plumeria and bamboo trees as the subject for their textile prints. The showing was held at a home in the West Village area of New York City. Awards Alkire and Haus were awarded the Ecco Domani Fashion Foundation Award for Womenswear in January 2012. The award recognizes emerging American fashion talent. In 2012, the designers were named to the W Hotels Fashion Next program. In 2013, the Autumn/Winter collection was sponsored by Swarovski Elements. In 2015, the designers were awarded The Fashion Group International Rising Star Award for womenswear. There were ten finalists competing for the award that included Rosie Assoulin, Tome, Ji Oh, Tanya Taylor, Antonio Azzuolo, Harbison, and Houghton. Previous winners of the award include Proenza Schouler, Alexander Wang (designer), Jason Wu, Phillip Lim, and Wes Gordon. Wu was the guest speaker at the award ceremony.

The Social Alternative party takes part in the Buenos Aires autonomic city elections with its own candidates, while the PCP integrated the Citizens Front.

It was especially associated with the Berni Inn chain which popularised mass-market dining out after the end of food rationing in Britain, following the Second World War. The Prawn Cocktail Years, by Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham, called this meal the Great British Meal Out.Hopkinson, Simon and Lindsey Bareham. (2006) The Prawn Cocktail Years. London: Michael Joseph, jacket notes. Originally published 1997 by Macmillan. Background Laura Mason in Food Culture in Great Britain wrote that \\"In mid-twentieth-century Britain, eating out had a dreadful image. Badly served, poor and unimaginative food, discourteous staff, and dining rooms with limited and inconvenient hours\\". Food rationing, introduced during the Second World War, did not end until 1954 and the range of eating-out options and variety of meals available remained limited, only gradually expanding through the 1950s and 60s. Meal The Great British Meal Out was a meal in a restaurant designed to appeal to those for whom eating out at all was unusual and for whom a prawn cocktail, steak garni or gateau were exotic foreign food. Nigel Slater wrote of his childhood in the 1970s: \\"As a family, we never went out for dinner unless we were on holiday, but there were occasional Saturday lunches at the local Berni Inn\\" adding \\"Steak garni always sounded so much more exotic than plain steak.\\"National treasures Nigel Slater, The Observer, 30 September 2007. Retrieved 1 July 2014. The standardised menu suited the restaurant, who could purchase and prepare food in bulk within tight cost controls,Frank Berni The Telegraph, 12 July 2000. Retrieved 1 July 2014. and avoided the need for the customer to choose courses from a menu which might include foods with which they were unfamiliar or which might include hard to pronounce foreign words, both of which had the potential to cause social embarrassment. The ingredients of the meal had a pleasantly sophisticated ring: \\"cocktail\\", the use of prawns, which was not common, \\"steak garni\\" rather than just steak, and \\"Black Forest g√¢teau\\" rather than just cake; all slightly foreign but easy enough to learn for next time, and allowing the diner to feel that they were enjoying a \\"continental\\" (European) eating experience. The meal eventually became unfashionable as British dining tastes became more sophisticated from the 1980s onwards and the Gallup survey conducted by the trade magazine Caterer and Hotelkeeper in 1989 confirmed that Black Forest g√¢teau had suddenly become less popular. Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham coined the term \\"Great British Meal\\" in their 1997 book The Prawn Cocktail Years, which includes a chapter titled The Great British Meal Out. They wrote that, \\"cooked as it should be, this much derided and often ridiculed dinner is still something very special indeed\\". Association with Berni Inns The meal became associated with the Berni Inn chain, established 1955 and which had 147 hotels and restaurants by 1970, making it the largest food chain outside the United States. The chain prospered by offering a menu with a limited number of options in \\"Olde Worlde\\" style restaurants that looked much the same in every branch. The most popular meal at a \\"Berni\\", even as late as the 1980s, remained prawn cocktail, steak and chips, and Black Forest g√¢teau. In their 2000 obituary of Frank Berni, The Guardian noted \\"the Briton's favourite menu of prawn cocktail, steak and Black Forest g√¢teau\\". The Bristol Post noted that, by the 1980s, the Berni format was starting to look dated and \\"By then, Berni Inns were becoming popular shorthand for naff ‚Äì prawn cocktail starter, steak & chips main, Black Forest g√¢teau for dessert\\". The Berni Inn chain was sold to Whitbread in 1990 and became the Beefeater chain. In 2013, The Times reported on the bankruptcy of the Scotch Steak Houses chain earlier that year, which it cast as latter day Berni Inns. The paper wrote that \\"for three decades [the owner] has run restaurants where time ‚Äì and quality ‚Äì appeared to stand still. While his rivals sought to keep pace with consumer tastes, Ali Salih's Aberdeen, Highland and Angus steakhouses continued to serve prawn cocktail, steak and Black Forest g√¢teau to diners seated on velour banquettes as they quaffed Blue Nun.\\" In fiction In his 1990 novel Titmuss Regained, John Mortimer has Sir Willoughby mention \\"prawn cocktail, followed by steak and 'all the trimmings', to be topped off with a liberal helping of Black Forest g√¢teau\\".

He was also recognized as a potter and draftsman.'Hlavacek, well-known artist, dies,' The Milwaukee Journal, July 6, 1982, pg. 8 Biography Hlavacek was born on July 13, 1921 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, to Frank and Cecilia Hlavacek of Czech/Yugoslavian descent. He graduated from the Layton School of Art in Milwaukee in 1949 (a school that would also produce artists Paul Faulkner, Knute Heldner, Karl Priebe, Walter Sheffer, among others). He received his master's degree in fine arts from the Instituto Allende, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, in 1970. He was faculty in the art department at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater from 1964 until his death in 1982. Hlavacek was known for both the \\"force and originality of his symbolism...and the bold simplification of form and color which was his trademark\\" (The Milwaukee Journal, July 6, 1982). His inspiration came from the Wisconsin landscape and local plants, animals, and insects, and butterflies were a common theme in his later work. Following his study in San Miguel de Allende, Hlavacek's work also took on color palettes, objects, and patterns reminiscent of indigenous Mexican art. Hlavacek described his motivation in an interview in 1952: \\"Today's world is just too real, too much with us, so I like to deal with what some might term unreality.\\" Recognition In 1952 he won first place in Hallmark's Second International Art Competition. His entry was reproduced in Life magazine. He also received purchase awards in Gimbels' Wisconsin Centennial competition and the Wisconsin Renaissance competition sponsored by Marine Banks. His art appears in many public and private collections, including those of the Milwaukee Art Museum, Museum of Wisconsin Art, Marquette University, Alverno College, The University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, and the Bergstrom-Mahler Museum, among many others.

Martin Woollacott reviewed the book along with the book A Problem from Hell by Samantha Power, for The Guardian. He concluded: \\"We have yet to work out properly how the post-twin towers interventions relate to those that went before. But there is obvious irony in the fact that while previously, as these books illustrate so clearly, determination was often lacking to deal with crises that most people agreed were serious, there was no shortage of it when the Bush administration moved to deal with a crisis on which there was no global consensus at all.\\" The book was also reviewed by Hugh O'Shaugnessy in The Observer alongside Never Learn to Type: A Woman at the United Nations. =War Games= Polman's book War Games: The Story of Aid and War in Modern Times argued that humanitarian aid intervention often ended up fueling wars and making them worse.

Occurrences The size of New Zealand, it re-occurred each winter between 1974 and 1976. These were the first three austral winters observed by the Nimbus-5 Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR). From 1976 to 2015 this polynya was rarely observed. The polynya reoccurred in 2016, and has since appeared in 2017. The 2010s occurrence has been smaller than the 1970s occurrence, being about the size of Maine in 2017, or roughly . Since the 1970s, the polar Southern Ocean south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has freshened and stratified, likely a result of anthropogenic climate change. Such stratification may be responsible for suppressing the return of the Weddell Sea polynya. More recently, it was found that intense cyclones occurring over the ice pack, far south from the ice edge, were at the origin of the reoccurrence of the Weddell or Maud Rise Polynya in austral winter 2017. In certain winter months, the general atmospheric circulation around Antarctica exhibits a strong zonal wave 3 pattern which favor the development of polar cyclones closer to the coast i.e. over preconditioned oceanographic areas for polynya formation such as the Weddell Polynya in the Lazarev Sea and the Cosmonaut polynya in the Cosmonaut Sea around Antarctica. Other Antarctic polynyas The presence of polynyas in McMurdo Sound provides an ice-free area where penguins can feed, so is important for the survival of the Cape Royds penguin colony.

The book uses fictional characters, worlds, and technology from the Star Wars universe as starting points for discussion of factual concepts in cosmology, biology, and technology, and discusses in a \\"semi- serious\\" fashion the scientific probability of such fictional elements. \\"It takes the fantastic elements of the movies‚Äîlike faster-than-light travel‚Äîand examines the current state of science to see if they're possible\\". Summary Chapter 1: Planetary Environments covers topics such as cosmology, planetary science, desert ecosystems, and the biochemical requirements for the origin of life, using fictional Star Wars locales such as Tatooine and Endor as starting points for discussion. Chapter 2: Aliens discusses biological and evolutionary concepts such as bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion, mammalian physiology, bioluminescence, and others, based on fictional creatures such as Wookiees, Jawas, Ewoks, and Hutts (the race to which Jabba belongs). Chapter 3: Droids explores topics such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, human psychology using robotic droids such as C-3PO and R2-D2 as prompts. Chapter 4: Spaceships and Weapons covers advances in quantum physics, string theory, anti-gravity, and laser technology, stemming from fictional devices such as lightsabers, and the Death Star. Chapter 5: The Force discusses the plausibility of Jedi powers and \\"the Force\\" by exploring quantum physical concepts of tachyons and superstring theory as well as various fringe and the parascientific concept of parapsychology. Reception The book received generally positive reception for covering complex theories and concepts in a manner comprehensible and entertaining to non-specialists. Charles Kolb of the National Endowment for the Humanities writes that Cavelos \\"has given us a good story and has transported the reader from science fiction to science fact and probability... There is a great deal of scientific material presented in an upbeat, non-trivialized, well-written and engaging style.\\" However, Kolb found Cavelos' lack of direct citations to publications and expert interviews \\"particularly distressing\\" for readers wishing to verify in-line quotations or easily locate additional sources.

It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development.  History  Firebase evolved from Envolve, a prior startup founded by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee in 2011. Envolve provided developers an API that enables the integration of online chat functionality into their websites. After releasing the chat service, Tamplin and Lee found that it was being used to pass application data that were not chat messages. Developers were using Envolve to sync application data such as game state in real time across their users. Tamplin and Lee decided to separate the chat system and the real-time architecture that powered it. They founded Firebase as a separate company in September 2011 and it launched to the public in April 2012. Firebase's first product was the Firebase Realtime Database, an API that synchronizes application data across iOS, Android, and Web devices, and stores it on Firebase's cloud. The product assists software developers in building real-time, collaborative applications. In May 2012, a month after the beta launch, Firebase raised $1.1 million in seed funding from venture capitalists Flybridge Capital Partners, Greylock Partners, Founder Collective, and New Enterprise Associates. In June 2013, the company further raised $5.6 million in Series A funding from Union Square Ventures and Flybridge Capital Partners. In 2014, Firebase launched two products. Firebase Hosting and Firebase Authentication. This positioned the company as a mobile backend as a service. In October 2014, Firebase was acquired by Google. A year later, in October 2015, Google acquired Divshot, an HTML5 web-hosting platform, to merge it with the Firebase team. In May 2016, at Google I/O, the company's annual developer conference, Firebase introduced Firebase Analytics and announced that it was expanding its services to become a unified backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform for mobile developers. Firebase now integrates with various other Google services, including Google Cloud Platform, AdMob, and Google Ads to offer broader products and scale for developers. Google Cloud Messaging, the Google service to send push notifications to Android devices, was superseded by a Firebase product, Firebase Cloud Messaging, which added the functionality to deliver push notifications to both iOS and web devices. In January 2017, Google acquired Fabric and Crashlytics from Twitter to add those services to Firebase. In October 2017, Firebase has launched Cloud Firestore, a real-time document database as the successor product to the original Firebase Realtime Database.  Products  The Firebase platform has 18 products split into three groups: Develop, Quality, and Grow.  User privacy controversies  Firebase has been claimed to be used by Google to track users without their knowledge. On July 14, 2020, a lawsuit was filed accusing Google of violating federal wire tap law and California privacy law. It stated that through Firebase, Google collected and stored users data, logging what the user are looking at in many types of apps, despite the user following Google's own instructions to turn off the web and app activity collected by the company.

USM Modular Furniture is a renowned Swiss manufacturer of modular furniture for the home and office. The company‚Äôs signature product line, USM Haller, is widely celebrated as a design classic and included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. USM Modular Furniture employs a staff of 460 throughout Europe and America and is represented by more than 410 sales partners in 40 countries worldwide. USM has an international presence with furniture showrooms in Bern, Berlin, Hamburg, D√ºsseldorf, Munich, Paris, Stuttgart, Tokyo, and New York City. The company‚Äôs New York showroom and corporate offices are located at 28 Greene Street in SoHo. Company history USM Haller Workstation USM was founded in Switzerland by Ulrich Schaerer in 1885 as a producer of iron works and window fittings. In the late 1940s, USM increased its product lines with metal and sheet-metal work to respond to the post-war economy. In 1961, Paul Schaerer, grandson of USM founder Ulrich Schaerer, chose to take the company in a new direction by transforming the factory from a large, manually-oriented metal production plant into a modern, industrial enterprise. To achieve this goal, Schaerer commissioned Swiss architect Fritz Haller to design a building that would accommodate the Munsingen-based company‚Äôs factory and provide ample space for administrative offices. The building collaboration with Haller proved so successful that, in 1963, Schaerer, together with Haller, created the pioneering furniture product known today as USM Haller Systems for the company‚Äôs open-plan offices. Since the establishment of the USM Haller System, the classic furniture line has been utilized in homes and offices around the world. Product lines USM Haller Infostand Rollcontainer by USM Modular Furniture. USM Haller furniture systems and product lines include the USM Display presentation system (developed in 1989), the USM Kitos modular table system (1990), and the USM Inos internal organization system (1996). In 2010, USM launched its Quick Ship program to respond to increased demand for classic modern furniture pieces from the USM Haller modular system by making them available for delivery within 2‚Äì3 weeks in the Continental United States. Quick Ship represents a large selection USM pieces for the home and office, such as credenzas, shelving, tables, storage, and nightstands. These selections are in stock, pre-built, and available in seven colors. USM Haller The main administration from USM Haller in Br√ºhl, 2009 USM Haller‚Äôs elegant proportions and minimalist design is characterized by high-quality construction and simplicity that gives the modern furniture flexibility as to how it can be configured and adapt to changing needs over time. The underlying impetus behind USM Haller modular furniture is that form follows function. Each furniture system is designed to be appropriate for both home and office environments and assimilates with any architectural or interior design. The concept of the USM Haller system is a modular freestanding desk and storage solution for the office or home. The tables are offered in standard shapes, sizes and finishes that can be accessorized with equipment for modern technology including: swing arms for telephones, monitors and computers, paper, and wire management organizers. The USM Haller system frame is based on and constructed with three basic elements: the ball, connecting tubes and panels. The system can be built in any direction, taken apart and reconfigured for changing requirements. The furniture units can be further customized per application by adding doors, drawers and a variety of internal organizational accessories. USM Kitos Introduced in 1990, Kitos (Complex Integrated Table Organization System) is a highly functional modular table system that responds to the challenges of a fast paced work environment. Kitos can be transformed from a meeting table into a workstation. Its features include an adjustable column support, height and tilting work surfaces. Kitos offers a wide array of accessories: swing arms for monitors, telephones and computers, a ‚Äúthird level‚Äù shelf that can hold more equipment or increase a work surface and cable management. Like Haller, Kitos may be arranged in a variety of configurations. USM Display USM Display was introduced in 1989 and is a multi-functional partition and presentation system. The vertical supports provide the base for a variety of paneling options and organizational accessories. The system is ideal for reception, conferencing and retail purposes.

The Butler family began their dry goods and hardware business in the 1850s, and in 1909 built 2 two-story buildings on New Hope's main street. The central building was used for a general merchandise, dry goods, and hardware store and office space. It features a five-bay fa√ßade with cast iron columns separating large glass panes atop wood panel bulkheads on the storefront level. Large transom windows over the main windows cast light into the room with 18-foot (5.5-meter) ceilings and a mezzanine in the rear. The northern building was used for a bank until the Great Depression, after which it was connected to the central building and used as a grocery store. It is shorter than the central building, due to a lower ceiling on the ground floor. Both of the older buildings have brick corbelling and slightly arched second-floor windows. The one-story southern building was constructed in 1939 and housed a furniture store. Three bays in width, its ground floor appearance is similar to the northern building, but its roofline is more plain. The business flourished from the 1930s to the 1950s, when the it also sold farm equipment, fertilizers, and building materials, and bought cotton and cottonseed. Business declined as agriculture waned and commercial activity in nearby Huntsville increased, and the company closed in the mid-1970s.

When he was sixteen, he went to California after contracting tuberculosis. He arrived in Los Angeles in 1926, where he worked as an artist and ran the Owl Restaurant. Miyagi was aware of the exploitation of Okinawan farmers by the Japanese, and witnessed similar treatment of Japanese by Americans.

Historically, the rules around factual inquiries in decisions around petitions for habeas corpus had been based on the Opinion on the Writ of Habeas Corpus, a House of Lords disquisition by Wilmot CJ in 1758, which effectively nullified a bill for passage of An Act for giving a more speedy Remedy to the Subject upon the Writ of Habeas Corpus. It made the argument that the writ allowed the judge only to ask for an explanation of why the prisoner was jailed known as the 'return'), not to debate whether that explanation was justified or to examine the facts of it ('controvert' it), which was the role of the jury. There were several ways around that. One was \\"confessing and avoiding\\", introducing and discussing contradicting the facts reported by the jailer, but simply invalidating them. A second method was \\"proceeding by rule and motion\\"; by making a ruling that was independent of the return, the judges did not technically argue with the return or contradict it, but the same outcome was reached as if they had done so. That caused some concern because of feelings that it restricted the ability of the courts to deal with arguments over facts from the applicant for the writ. A bill was introduced in 1758 to resolve that but was rejected; a second bill was introduced in 1816 and passed, coming into law as the Habeas Corpus Act 1816. It explicitly allows judges to question and debate the facts laid out in a return, but it deliberately does not extend to criminal cases for fear that it could lead to a full trial being conducted just on the petition and return. It, however, seemingly applies if the petitioner or subject has been arrested for a criminal matter but not charged. Judith Farbey, a barrister and commentator on the law of habeas corpus, argues that the law is pointless; almost anything that could be justified under the 1816 Act could also be justified by classifying the fact that the judge wants to discuss as a \\"jurisdictional fact\\", another way of permitting debate. Paul D. Halliday, a professor of history at the University of Virginia agreed, arguing that \\"all these usages had been available at common law, and there is reason to question the status this act has traditionally received\\". The end result, though, was that \\"the rule against controverting the return may safely be regarded as a harmless relic of the past\\". Outside United Kingdom, legislation in various British territories and dominions ensured that it was enshrined in much Commonwealth law, including that of Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. Outside tho jurisdictions in which it had a direct effect, it was still influential and was \\"soon duplicated in most American states\\".

Taxonomy Paleontologist Georg Baur named the genus Hyporhina in 1893, making it one of the first prehistoric amphisbaenians to be described. Baur placed it in its own family, Hyporhinidae, because it possessed eye sockets that are enclosed at the back by postorbital bars, a feature that living amphisbaenians lack. However, more recent studies have placed it within Rhineuridae, a family that includes the living Rhineura floridana from Florida, and many more extinct species from the western United States that were named after 1893 and have postorbital bars. Hyporhina differs from other rhineurids in having a steep angle to its snout.

He was one of the wealthiest landowners in the province, and was appointed the king's secretary and mayor of Laon. On 22 March 1789 he was elected deputy of the third estate for Vermandois in the Estates General. He sat with the reformers, and spoke against export of grain. In June 1791 he was secretary of the Assembly. He was president of the district of Chauny after the session. Convention Lecarlier was elected a member of the National Convention for the department of Aisne on 6 September 1792. At the trial of King Louis XVI of France he voted for the appeal to the people and against the suspension. His vote on the death sentence was not recorded, but he certainly voted in favor.

She composed her poetry in the Bravanese dialect spoken in Barawa. Biography Dada Masiti was born Mana Sitti Habib Jamaladdin in the 1810s in Barawa (Brava), a coastal town in southern Somalia. Her family on both sides hailed from the Mahadali Ashraf clan. Her mother's maternal grandfather also belonged to the Ali Naziri Ashraf, which commanded more influence in the area and was the larger of the two subclans. The Ashraf had first established residence in Barawa around the start of the 1600s, and ultimately traced their lineage to the Prophet Muhammad. What is known about Dada Masiti's early years is exclusively derived from different oral traditions. Accounts endorsed by descendants of her nearer relatives indicate that she was kidnapped and taken to Zanzibar. While she had been abducted, the kidnapping occurred while she was a teenager and was carried out with her consent by a suitor that her family had turned down as a potential husband. The two eloped and were wed in Pate. Their relationship shortly afterwards fell apart, and she was then reportedly held in a manner approaching slavery for around ten years. She eventually succeeded in escaping, and her maternal cousin Omar Qullatten, who at the time resided in Zanzibar, came to her rescue. Dada Masiti herself appears to confirm this version of events in her poetry since she alludes to having been led astray by worldly lures, and expresses contrition and a desire to atone for her deeds. Her poems also mention Omar Qullatten by name, and repeatedly request that God bless him. Dada Masiti never remarried and bore no children. Dada Masiti immersed herself in religious studies under a Sheikh Mohammed Janna al- Bahluli. A follower of the Qadiriyya, her poetry demonstrates a detailed understanding of the Quran and Sunnah. Poetry dedicated to her by her contemporaries gives evidence that she was well-respected. Sheikh Qasim Muhyiddin al-Barawi referred to her as a \\"treasure to be jealously preserved\\". Dada Masiti's most famous poem was \\"After Life, Comes Death: When the Sheikh Dies, No One Should Weep\\", composed for her friend, the jurist Sheikh Nureni Mohammed Sabir. She also composed \\"Shaikhi Chifa isiloowa\\", a eulogy for Sheikh Nurein Ahmed al-Sabir al-Hatimy. Many of her contemporaries committed to memory her poetry, particularly women. Her verse still figures prominently in the poetic annals of Barawa. After her death, Dada Masiti was buried on the site of her small house in Barawa. An annual ziyƒÅrah to her shrine is observed in the town.

Education and early career Gleeson grew up in the North of England and attended a secondary school in Keighley. She studied A-Levels in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Chemistry. She graduated from the University of Manchester in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Physics. She went to study for a PhD which she was awarded in 1986 for investigations of the optical and electro-optical properties of chiral mesophases. She remained at Manchester, working as a senior scientist in the Wolfson Liquid Crystal industrially funded research centre. She was made a university lecturer in 1989. Research Gleeson's research investigates self-assembling and self-ordering materials, especially chiral liquid crystals. At the University of Manchester, Gleeson was made Associate Dean for Research in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences in 2004. Between 2008 and 2010 she served as Head of the School of Physics and Astronomy. She has served as the Chairman of the British Liquid Crystal Society. It was announced that Glesson would move to the University of Leeds as Head of School and Cavendish Chair of Physics in late 2014. The position has been occupied by several eminent physicists, including Lawrence Bragg. She joined the University of Leeds in January 2015, but maintains a position at the University of Manchester as a visiting scientist. She is interested in novel experimental techniques to characterise liquid crystals, and in 2016 contributed a chapter on Raman spectroscopy to the book Liquid Crystals with Nano and Microparticles. Her work concentrates on the experimental study of liquid crystals; in particular those with reduced symmetry. She looks to use liquid crystals for photonics. She holds several patents, including one for switchable contact lenses where the application of a voltage can change the refractive index of a liquid crystal. This can moderate the focus of the lenses, the same as changing putting on reading glasses. She has also invented liquid crystalline temperature recorders, where the liquid crystal contains a reactive monomer and an initiator that can crosslink. Working with Andre Geim, Gleeson produced the first graphene liquid crystal device. The devices contained transparent graphene electrodes, and had an exceptionally high contrast ratio. Gleeson went on to use graphene in the switchable liquid crystalline contact lenses. In 2015, Gleeson and her PhD student Devesh Mistry were awarded a Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 industry fellowship to work with UltraVision on novel contact lenses that incorporate liquid crystals into intraocular lenses, particularly for people suffering from presbyopia. In 2017 she launched a five-year ¬£1 million partnership with Merck & Co. to investigate liquid crystals in optical innovations. In 2018 Gleeson and Mistry demonstrated a negative order parameter in a liquid crystal elastomer. This work marked a breakthrough for the auxetic liquid crystal community; offering the first synthetic molecular auxetic material. Her current research includes liquid crystals for laser protection and biosensing. She looks to develop a flexible and cheap strip that acts like a Liquid crystal thermometer, but instead of monitoring changes in temperature changes colour when it detects a bacterial toxin or biomarker. Throughout her career, Gleeson has been involved in several initiatives to improve gender balance in physics. She is involved with the Women's Engineering Society. She was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 2009, in recognition of her outreach efforts, and in particular her work to increase the number of girls studying physics.

Daley was part of the Chicago jazz scene for 40 years. Musicians who studied with Daley include Grammy winners David Sanborn and Paul Winter, Emmy winner James DiPasquale, Richard Corpolongo, Chuck Domanico, and John Klemmer. In Detroit Joseph Albert Daley was born July 30, 1918, in Salem, Ohio. He moved to Detroit, Michigan as a child. At age 18, Daley got his first saxophone. He started with an alto sax but soon gravitated to a tenor sax. Daley was drawn to the jazz bands of Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Larry Clinton, Tommy Dorsey, and Artie Shaw, and his early models for playing were Coleman Hawkins, Georgie Auld, and Lester \\"Pres\\" Young. He studied with orchestral saxophonist Larry Teal and others, but wanting to expand beyond them into jazz, Daley was forced to become mostly self-taught. In the late 1930s Daley played with small combos in Detroit and did some touring, including to New York. He appreciated that the New York and Detroit branches of the American Federation of Musicians were racially integrated (it would not be until 1974 that all locals would be so), which gave Daley the opportunity to experience a unique musical and cultural crossover, a rarity for the times. When World War II began, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and became a pilot. He played sax in the Air Corps Band. After his discharge, he moved to Chicago. In Chicago After the war when Bebop music emerged and Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker came on the scene, Daley, like many jazz musicians, was impressed by Parker‚Äôs style, which took Daley in a more experimental direction musically. To expand his musicianship with a classical musical education, he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Music from Chicago Musical College (now part of Roosevelt University). He further pursued a Master's degree in Composition. In 1950-51 Daley toured with Woody Herman in the Third Herd band with Urbie Green on trombone, Sonny Igoe on drums, and Red Mitchell on bass. He also performed about 30 uncredited sides for Pat Boone on Dot Records. Daley worked as a jobbing musician and as a music teacher at Chicago‚Äôs Rizzo School of Music. As early as 1955, he was inspired by the work of Ornette Coleman to take up what became known as \\"free\\" jazz. Although not commercially viable at the time, he later focused on this style with his bands, The Joe Daley Trio and The Joe Daley Quorum. The Joe Daley Trio formed in 1959 with percussionist Hal Russell and bassist Russell Thorne. In 1963 they played at the Newport Jazz Festival, and RCA Records later released The Joe Daley Trio At Newport ‚Äô63. At the Down Beat Jazz Festival in 1965, bassist Thorne had been replaced with Clyde Flowers. In 1972, The Joe Daley Quorum was formed with Richard Corpolongo on alto sax and piccolo, Bobby Lewis on trumpet, Bobby Roberts on electric bass (later Steve LaSpina), and Hal Russell (later Dan Martin) on percussion. Daley played dates in many Chicago clubs and hotels of the era, including Mr. Kelly‚Äôs, The Lemon Tree, The Playboy Club, The Happy Medium, The Downbeat, The London House, The BackRoom, and The Jazz Showcase, among others. From 1971 to 1974 he had a society music job in the house band at the Mill Run Playhouse, a renowned dinner theatre outside Chicago. He played behind Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Sammy Davis Jr. and Ella Fitzgerald. In 1968 Daley performed a jazz composition in concert for The Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He occasionally played commercials and did some promotions for Selmer Instruments. From 1978 to 1987, he played a regular weekly session at Chicago‚Äôs Orphan‚Äôs nightclub, with a rotating cast of local jazz players and some of Daley‚Äôs own students. He paid the rhythm section out of his own pocket when nights were slow. Early in his career, Daley played a Selmer saxophone. By the 1950s he played a vintage 1920‚Äôs Conn \\"New Wonder\\" sax. In the 1970s and 1980s he played a King Super 20 sax, with a Berg Larsen 95/2 mouthpiece. Daley also doubled on clarinet, and in the 1960s he added flute to his instruments. Teaching Daley gave music lessons for 40 years. He trained saxophone students from the beginner level and up. For musicians who were already musically competent on saxophone or other instruments, including voice, he taught improvisation, composition, and how to expand their range. DePaul University‚Äôs School of Music invited Daley to teach jazz at the university. They accepted his requirement that students be sent to his home for lessons. Daley joined the faculty in 1984 and taught until he left Chicago in 1987. Notable students included: Richard Corpolongo, Steve Duke, Rich Fudoli, Kent Minor and Abshalom Ben Shlomo.

He designed approximately 85 golf courses in about 13 years, his first in 1914, at age 40. His mentor was Charles Blair Macdonald, the creator of the National Golf Links of America, and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Raynor was also the mentor of Charles Banks who completed many of Raynor's unfinished works after he died. Banks went on to a solo design career, creating approximately 15 courses. Raynor was born in Manorville, New York. He attended Princeton University, studying civil engineering, before leaving in 1898 without a degree. He married Araminta (known as Minta) Hallock in 1903, and for the first years of his working life, engineered drains, roads and waterworks in the area around Southampton, N.Y. where his family had relocated and where he would live for the rest of his life. Golf course engineer, architect In 1908, Raynor was hired to perform a boundary survey of the site for the new course National Golf Links of America, in Southampton Long Island, by Macdonald. When it opened, NGLA was considered the finest American golf course and remains one of the top design in the world. Macdonald was impressed with Raynor and the two forged a working relationship and Raynor overseeing the construction of every course designed by Macdonald from then on, including Piping Rock Club, St. Louis Country Club, and the Mid Ocean Club, approximately 15 in all. By 1914, Raynor was handling his first solo design projects, including the Country Club of Fairfield, in Connecticut, and Westhampton Country Club on Long Island, New York. Between 1914-1917, Raynor oversaw the construction of The Lido Club, designed by Macdonald. This was one of the most difficult and expensive golf projects to that date. Raynor, who rarely played golf, never became adept at the sport, reportedly not wanting to design around his own game. All of Raynor's courses feature adaptations of some of what Macdonald considered the ideal golf in the British Isles and Europe, such as the Redan, Biarritz, Eden, Leven, Road and Maiden. Raynor, like Macdonald and later Charles Banks, fit the concept of the originals into the particular site, never seeking to duplicate them. Raynor never saw any of the originals in person. On every Raynor golf course, though, some of if not the finest holes to be found are ones Raynor created with basing them on ideal golf holes. Several of Raynor's designs have hosted and continue to host significant events. His Waialae Country Club in Honolulu has hosted the PGA Tour's Sony Open since the 1960s, making it one of the longest- running host sites on the Tour. At The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, his Old White TPC Course hosted a PGA Tour event. The Country Club of Charleston hosted the 2019 U.S. Women's Open won by Lee Jeong-eun also known as Jeongeun Lee6. Raynor died with his wife by his side from pneumonia in 1926, age 51, while in West Palm Beach, Florida, to open Paris Singer's private course, often mistaken for the Everglades Golf Club, which Singer founded and Raynor designed.

Created in July 1942 at Camp Ripley, Minnesota, the battalion originally consisted of 1,001 soldiers.\\"99th Infantry Battalion (Separate).\\" 99th Infantry Battalion (Sep) ‚Äì World War 2 Educational Foundation, 2013. Web. The battalion was attached to the First Army; however, it was labeled \\"Separate\\" because it was not attached to a specific regiment. Background After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the War Department considered how the military could use foreigners and bilingual, first-generation immigrants from German-occupied areas to assist the war effort. The initial assessment concluded that it would be \\"un-American\\" to train foreign troops on US soil, prompting the Norwegian government to refuse a request to recruit Norwegians in the United States for military training in Canada. After a time, however, the War Department decided to set up special units of US citizens from certain ethnic groups for operations in countries occupied by the Axis powers. The following five battalions, established in 1942, were organized based on ethnic groups: * 1st Filipino Infantry Battalion: Filipino (the nucleus of later 1st and 2nd Filipino infantry regiments) * 99th Infantry Battalion (separate): Norwegianhttp://www.99battalion.org/index.htm * 100th Infantry Battalion (separate): Japanese * 101st Infantry Battalion (separate): Austrian (dissolved in 1943 before active service) * 122nd Infantry Battalion (separate): Greek A Polish unit was also proposed, but never created. Personnel In Norwegian historiography, the men of the 99th Infantry Battalion are often referred to as \\"Norwegian'Americans.\\" This is only partially correct; the original intention was to transfer as many voluntary \\"Norwegian nationals\\" who had begun the immigration process (a condition of enlistment) to the unit from existing armies as could be acquired. In her book, The 99th Battalion, the Norwegian novelist Gerd Nyquist estimates that first-generation Norwegian immigrants may have constituted 50 percent of the original force ‚Äì about 500 men. One of Nyquist's sources from the battalion said 40 percent of the battalion had been Norwegian citizens (around 400 soldiers). This figure was the result of an informal survey conducted by Nyquist; however, the survey was limited to 152 respondents. Based on information from a veteran of the battalion, Max Hermansen argues in his book D-dagen 1944 og norsk innsats that there were approximately 300 Norwegians in the battalion. Training In October, 1942, the battalion moved to Fort Snelling, Minnesota; and again in December, 1942, to Camp Hale in Colorado for training in winter warfare and alpine warfare. On September 5, 1943, the 99th Infantry Battalion was shipped out from New York to Scotland. In the UK, the battalion was stationed in Perham Down Camp in Wiltshire, between Salisbury and Andover. The training there was for infantry purposes as D-Day approached, and it became increasingly clear that the battalion would receive its baptism by fire in Operation Overlord. OSS Norwegian Special Operations Group During the stay at Camp Hale in 1943, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) asked for volunteers from the battalion. The OSS selected 80 enlisted men and twelve officers for what would become OSS Norwegian Special Operations Group (NORSOG). OSS special operations groups were the Americans' counterpart to Britain's Special Operations Executive. NORSOG was initially intended for action in Norway, but, by 1944, the group was instead used in operations behind German lines in France. In early 1945, NORSOG operated in Norway where they performed railway sabotage until the liberation (Operation Lapwing, also known as Operation Grouse). In combat The 99th Infantry Battalion landed on Omaha Beach on the evening of June 22, 1944, and then took part in the final battle for Cherbourg. As a \\"separate\\" battalion, it belonged to no regiment, but was attached to different formations as needed. From September, the battalion operated in Belgium. During Christmas 1944, the battalion was involved in the Battle of the Bulge. The battalion participated in the following campaigns: * Normandy: June 22, 1944 ‚Äì July 24, 1944 * Northern France: June 25, 1944 ‚Äì September 14, 1944 * Rhineland (W√ºrzlen‚ÄìAachen): September 15, 1944 ‚Äì December 16, 1944 * Ardennes‚ÄìAlsace: December 17, 1944 ‚Äì January 18, 1945 * Central Europe: April 4, 1945 ‚Äì May 11, 1945 The 99th Infantry Battalion spent 101 days in combat. The casualties suffered were 52 killed in combat, 207 wounded and six missing in action. These 207 men were wounded multiple times, several five times, thus the 207 received 305 Purple Hearts. The following individual decorations and medals were awarded to members of the 99th Infantry Battalion: * 15 Silver Stars * 20 Bronze Stars * 305 Purple Hearts * 763 Good Conduct Medals * 814 Combat Infantry badges 474th Regiment On January 19, 1945, the 99th Infantry Battalion joined the 474th Infantry Regiment in Child-sur-Mer. The regiment was recently formed, partly to prepare for a possible invasion of Norway in the event of a partial German withdrawal from Norway. At this point, the German forces in Norway evacuated and burned Finnmark, and retreated behind the Lyngen Line. A scenario where the Germans had to retreat south of Dovre, making it possible to establish the Norwegian government in Trondheim, seemed likely. On April 2, the regiment moved to Aachen, in Germany. The 99th Infantry Battalion's tasks consisted mainly of patrolling and the suppression of pockets of continued German resistance until May 11. Between April 15‚Äì18, 1945, the 474th Infantry Regiment, including the 99th Infantry Battalion, was responsible for the transportation of Nazi treasures found the Merkers mine. The convoy, named \\"Task Force Hansen,\\" transported 3,762 bags of currency, 8,307 gold bars, 3,326 bags of gold coins, and numerous bags of silver, platinum, jewelry and art treasures to a safe place in the Frankfurt area. Post-War The 99th Infantry Battalion was reactivated at Fort Rucker, Alabama on September 30, 1956 when the 351st Infantry Regiment was inactivated and the infantry force on post reduced to battalion strength. It remained active for only a short while, however, and on 24 March 1958 it was inactivated, with its personnel and equipment being reorganized as the 2d Battle Group, 31st Infantry when the Army adopted the Pentomic organizational concept. Like the 351st before it and the 31st that followed, the 99th was a unit organized for Aviation Center training support at Fort Rucker.

The two groups were once unified in the Kasakela community. By 1974, researcher Jane Goodall noticed the community splintering.Goodall 2010, p. 120 Over a span of eight months, a large party of chimpanzees separated themselves into the southern area of Kasakela and were renamed the Kahama community. The separatists consisted of six adult males, three adult females and their young. The Kasakela was left with eight adult males, twelve adult females and their young. During the four-year conflict, all males of the Kahama community were killed, effectively disbanding the community. The victorious Kasakela then expanded into further territory but were later repelled by another community of chimpanzees.  Background  Prior to the four-year war, before it became a national park, Gombe National Park was known as the Gombe Stream Research Centre. The park is located in the lower region of the Kakombe Valley, and is known for its primate research opportunities first taken advantage of by researcher Jane Goodall, who served as the director of the Gombe Stream Research Centre. The site itself is composed of steep slopes of open woodland, rising above stream valleys lush with riverine forest. The chimpanzees roamed across these hills in territorial communities, which divided the chimps into parties ranging from one to 40 members. The term Kasakela refers to one of three areas of research in the central valley with the Kasakela in the north, the Kakombe, and the Mkenke to the south. Evidence of territorialism was first documented once Goodall followed the chimpanzees in their feeding situations, noting their aggressive territorial behavior, but she did not foresee the upcoming conflict. After the separation of the Kasakela community, the newly formed Kahama were led by the brother duo Hugh and Charlie, with the other males being Godi, De, Goliath, and the young Sniff. The Kasakela males consisted of the alpha male Figan, Satan, Sherry, Evered, Rodolf, Jomeo, and Humphrey.  War  First blood was drawn by the Kasakela community on January 7, 1974,Morris, p. 288 when a party of six adult Kasakela males consisting of Humphrey, Figan, Jomeo, Sherry, Evered, and Rodolf ambushed the isolated Kahama male Godi while he was feeding on a tree.Goodall 2010, p. 121 This was the first time that any of the chimpanzees had been seen to deliberately kill a fellow male chimp. After they had slain Godi, the victorious chimps celebrated boisterously, throwing and dragging branches with hoots and screams. After Godi fell, De was taken out next, and then Hugh.Goodall 2010, p. 105 Later on came the elderly Goliath. Throughout the war, Goliath had been relatively friendly with the Kasakela neighbors when encounters occurred. However, his kindness was not reciprocated and he was killed.Goodall 2010, pp. 105-106 Only three Kahama males remained: Charlie, Sniff, and Willy Wally, who was crippled from polio. Without a chance to strike back, Charlie was killed next.Goodall 2010, p. 106 After his death, Willy Wally disappeared and was never found. The last remaining Kahama male, the young Sniff, survived for over a year.Goodall 2010, p. 107 For some time it seemed as if he may escape into a new community or be welcomed back to the Kasakelas, but there was no such luck. Sniff, too, fell to the Kasakela war band.Goodall 2010, p.108 Of the females from Kahama, one was killed, two went missing, and three were beaten and kidnapped by the Kasakela males.Morris, p.289 The Kasakela then succeeded in taking over the Kahama's former territory. These territorial gains were not permanent, however. With the Kahama gone, the Kasakela territory now butted up directly against the territory of another chimpanzee community, called the Kalande.Goodall 2010, pp. 129-130 Cowed by the superior strength and numbers of the Kalande, as well as a few violent skirmishes along their border, the Kasakela quickly gave up much of their new territory. Furthermore, when they moved back northward, the Kasakela were harassed by Mitumba foragers, who also outnumbered the Kasakela community. Eventually hostilities died down and the regular order of things was restored.  Effects on Goodall  The outbreak of the war came as a disturbing shock to Goodall, who had previously considered chimpanzees to be, although similar to human beings, \\"rather 'nicer'\\" in their behavior.Goodall 2010, p. 128 Coupled with the observation in 1975 of cannibalistic infanticide by a high-ranking female in the community, the violence of the Gombe war first revealed to Goodall the \\"dark side\\" of chimpanzee behavior. She was profoundly disturbed by this revelation; in her memoir Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe, she wrote:  Legacy  Feeding station where Goodall used to feed the Gombe chimpanzees When Goodall reported on the events of the Gombe War, her account of a naturally occurring war between chimpanzees was not universally believed. At the time, scientific models of human and animal behavior virtually never overlapped. Some scientists accused her of excessive anthropomorphism; others suggested that her presence, and her practice of feeding the chimpanzees, had created violent conflict in a naturally peaceful society.Morris, p. 290 However, later research using less intrusive methods confirmed that chimpanzee societies, in their natural state, wage war. A 2018 study published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology concluded that the Gombe War was most likely a consequence of a power struggle between three high-ranking males, which was exacerbated by an unusual scarcity of fertile females.

It exists in current times as a dynamic and diverse culture with establishments and events held to promote LGBT culture and rights in Philadelphia and beyond.  History  The Philadelphia LGBT community has roots as far back as the 1930s and '40s. Early gay networks would meet privately at underground house parties and other private venues within Center City, West Philadelphia, and Germantown. The post-WWII Center City area provided plentiful housing and urban anonymity that allowed the LGBT culture to meet hidden from public view. By the 1950s, a jazz, espresso, and beatnik culture was stirring things up around Rittenhouse Square and in coffee houses on Sansom Street, creating a niche for the city's gay community. The LGBT culture developing in Philadelphia eventually inspired the first article published in America that recognized a city's gay community and political scene, which was titled \\"The Furtive Fraternity\\" (1962, by Gaeton Fonzi) and published in Greater Philadelphia. The article describes political limitations the emerging gay community faced. In 1962 the Janus Society was founded in Philadelphia; it is notable as the publisher of Drum magazine, one of the earliest LGBT-interest publications in the United States and most widely circulated in the 1960s, and for its role in organizing many of the nation's earliest LGBT rights demonstrations. Loughery, John (1998). The Other Side of Silence ‚Äì Men's Lives and Gay Identities: A Twentieth-Century History. New York, Henry Holt and Company. , p. 270 The Janus Society takes its name from the Roman two-faced God Janus of beginnings, endings, and doorways. The organization focused on a policy of militant respectability, a strategy demanding respect by showing the public LGBT individuals conforming to hetero- normative standards of dress at protests. On April 25, 1965 over 150 people were denied service at Dewey's, a local coffee shop and diner at 219 South 17th Street in Philadelphia, near Rittenhouse Square. Those denied service were variously described at the time as ‚Äúhomosexuals,‚Äù ‚Äúmasculine women,‚Äù ‚Äúfeminine men,‚Äù and ‚Äúpersons wearing non-conformist clothing.‚Äù Three teenagers (reported by the Janus Society and Drum to be two males and one female) staged a sit-in that day. After restaurant managers contacted police, the three were arrested. In the process of offering legal support for the teens, local activist and president of the Janus Society, Clark Polak, was also arrested. Demonstrations took place outside the establishment over the next five days with 1500 flyers being distributed by the Janus Society and its supporters. Three people staged a second sit-in on May 2, 1965. The police were again called, but refused to make arrests this time. The Janus Society said the protests were successful in preventing further arrests and the action was deemed ‚Äúthe first sit-in of its kind in the history of the United States‚Äù by Drum magazine. In 2018 a historical marker was placed at 17th and St. James streets to commemorate the Dewey‚Äôs sit-ins.https://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/new-historic-marker-in-philadelphias-rittenhouse-square-honors-early- lgbt-sit-in-at-deweys-300722004.html The Annual Reminders were a series of early pickets organized by LGBTQ organizations, which took place each July 4 at Independence Hall beginning in 1965 and were among the earliest LGBT demonstrations in the United States. The events were designed to inform and remind the American people that LGBT people did not enjoy basic civil rights protections. The Reminders were held each year until 1969, with the final picket taking place shortly after the June 28 Stonewall riot in New York City, considered the flashpoint of the modern gay liberation movement. Reminder organizers decided to discontinue the July 4 pickets. Instead, they organized the Christopher Street Liberation Day demonstration held June 28, 1970, to commemorate the anniversary of the riot. In 2005 a historical marker was placed at 6th and Chestnut Streets to commemorate the Annual Reminders. In 2014, gay trans man Lou Cutler became the first openly transgender man to be crowned Mr. Gay Philadelphia.  The Gayborhood  Washington Square West, commercially called Midtown Village. It is mainly referred as \\"The Gayborhood‚Äù by the locals.\\" Since the 1920s this area was a mecca for fashion and entertainment. During the 1960s a transition from high-end stage performances and chorus lines into cheap adult entertainment took place. \\"Musical bars\\" on Camac and Quince Streets hosted gay and lesbian clientele but required a fee to mob connections for law enforcement to look the other way. The preservation of these bars around 13th and Locust Streets, through dealings with the mob, made gay culture appear more closely tied to illegal activity, which drew attention from the authorities. The lumping together of prostitutes, drug dealers, and homosexuals provoked police raids on gay bars up into the early 1980s. During this time, demonstrations at Independence Hall for gay rights sought to raise the community from an underground and lascivious group into a more unified community and political entity. This same area of the city remains an epicenter for gay culture today. This Washington Square West district was selected to undergo gentrification in the mid-1970s and up to one-fifth of the old structures were razed. Shortly after the project began, federal assistance was discontinued and the district's demolished lots sat unoccupied during a long recovery period into the 1990s. Mayor Ed Rendell promoted a new era of gentrification which helped Washington Square West regain its footing and transform into a healthy, economically viable community by the early 2000s. In 2007, 36 rainbow street signs were mounted throughout intersections within 11th and Broad Streets, formally recognizing the Gayborhood as part of Philadelphia culture.  Bars and entertainment  A diverse range of gay-friendly businesses and organizations are located within Philadelphia. Some of these destinations include bars, nightclubs, performance theaters, shops, health centers, restaurants, and adult theaters . Popular bars and nightclubs include Jocks (formerly Boxers PHL), Knock, Stir, Tabu (former location of iCandy), Tavern on Camac, The Bike Stop, U Bar (formerly Uncles), Voyeur (formerly Pure), Toast Walnut Bar & Kitchen (formerly Westbury), and Woody's. Politics Mayor of Philadelphia John Street was elected in 1999 with the help of LGBT activists. After his election he selected over twelve LGBT persons to work in the transition team.Haider- Markel, Donald P. Gay and Lesbian Americans and Political Participation: A Reference Handbook (Political participation in America). ABC-CLIO, January 1, 2002. , 9781576072561. p. 145.  Events  The city hosts many events including Equality Forum, Blue Ball, Pride Parade, and OutFest.  Mazzoni Center  The Mazzoni Center, established in 1979, is the only health care provider in Philadelphia that operates specifically for the LGBT community. The center's array of HIV/AIDS-related and general health services benefit over 30,000 individuals annually. Community programs are open to the public that include focus groups and outreach programs. Other health care services include HIV and STD testing, food and housing options, mental and behavioral health services, and LGBT legal services. The center seeks to break down cultural insensitivity that LGBT individuals may encounter in mainstream healthcare systems by communicating through knowledgeable health care and preventative services conselors. William Way Community Center The William Way LGBT Community Center, founded in 1975, was founded as the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Philadelphia. It maintains an archive of local and regional LGBT information and culture, curates exhibitions, and offers community support. Philly AIDS Thrift Philly AIDS Thrift is a charitable organization founded in 2005. Its goal is to raise money and distribute the proceeds to local organizations involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Rehoboth Beach, Delaware Rehoboth Beach, in Delaware - also known as \\"Poodle beach\\" is around 2 hours drive from Philadelphia and is known as one of the mid-Atlantic coast's popular LGBT-friendly getaways because of the large number of LGBT-owned and operated businesses.

It solves problems in all branches of mechanics, including fluids, solids, and thermal analysis. Goma uses advanced numerical methods, focusing on the low-speed flow regime with coupled phenomena for manufacturing and performance applications. It also provides a flexible software development environment for specialty physics. Goma was created by Sandia National Laboratories and is currently supported by both Sandia and the University of New Mexico. Capabilities Goma is a finite element program which solves problems from all branches of mechanics, including fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, chemical reactions and mass transport, and energy transport. The conservation principles for momentum, mass, species, and energy, together with material constitutive relations, can be described by partial differential equations. The equations are made discrete for solution on a digital computer with the finite element method in space and the finite difference method in time. The resulting nonlinear, time-dependent, algebraic equations are solved with a full Newton- Raphson method. The linearized equations are solved with direct or Krylov- based iterative solvers. The simulations can be run on a single processor or on multiple processors in parallel using domain decomposition, which can greatly speed up engineering analysis. Example applications include, but are not limited to, coating and polymer processing flows, super-alloy processing, welding/soldering, electrochemical processes, and solid-network or solution film drying. A full description of Goma's capabilities can be found in Goma's capabilities document. Goma is frequently used in conjunction with other software packages. Cubit is typically used to generate computational meshes, while ParaView is often used to visualize the simulation results. Simulation output is generated in the ExodusII file format. History Goma originated in 1994 from an early version of MP_SALSA, a finite element program designed to simulate chemically reacting flows in massively-parallel computing environments. As a point-of-departure, Goma was originally extended and adapted to free and moving boundary problems in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and mass transfer. Five versions of Goma (1.0 through 5.0) were developed and released by Sandia from 1994 through 2012. These original versions of Goma were not approved for public release, and were released only internally within the US Government and its contracted industrial and academic partners. In 2013, Sandia released Goma 6.0 as open-source software under the GNU General Public License. It is hosted by GitHub and contains instructions on downloading additional software packages that are required to build Goma. Awards Goma 6.0 was awarded a 2014 R&D; 100 Award by R&D; Magazine.http://www.rdmag.com/award-winners/2014/07/2014-r-d-100-award-winners This award identifies the open-source release of Goma 6.0 as one of the top 100 technological innovations of 2013.

It was founded in 2008 in Lexington, North Carolina, and is now owned by investment firm Stage Fund. After investments by venture capitalists such as Revolution Growth, it expanded to include production facilities in New York City. Lolly Wolly Doodle sells most of its products through its Facebook page. Frydenlund claims the company was once the largest business on that site. It is considered by some business journalists to have succeeded in using Facebook as a sales platform where larger, established retailers had failed. The company takes a fast fashion approach to product development and production. Since it offers custom services like monogramming, it uses just-in-time production; its workers have been compared to short-order cooks. The network effects of distributing through a prominent social media site eliminate the need to spend money on marketing or advertising. History =2006‚Äì08: eBay= Brandi Temple started the company in 2008. Frustrated with the styles of clothing on offer for young girls at retailers, and unwilling to pay higher prices to boutiques that sold what she was looking for, Temple began sewing clothes on her own for her daughters. Finding a large amount of fabric left over after one session, she decided to make more clothing in the same style and offer them for sale on eBay rather than let it go to waste. With the help of family and friends, it eventually grew into a regular business. \\"Within a matter of months, we had turned our bedroom and garage into a mini-factory,\\" she writes on the company's website. She named it Lolly Wolly Doodle (LWD), a play on the children's song \\"Polly Wolly Doodle\\" that was her nickname for a niece of hers named Lolly. In 2008, as the eBay store was bringing regular extra income into the household, just as Will's business began to decline. Lolly Wolly Doodle was formally incorporated. =2008‚Äì10: Move to Facebook= Two years later patterns were sent to a Chinese company for quality testing. The resulting dresses were below expectations, so they decided to post them on the company's Facebook page rather than their regular eBay store. The potential customers could leave a comment on the posting with their email address and LWD would send a PayPal invoice at a discounted price. \\"I just snapped a picture and put it on Facebook,\\" Temple told Bloomberg News in 2013, claiming they sold out within 30 seconds. That was more business in one day than they had done on eBay in a month. As a result, they moved the online store from eBay to Facebook. Her family continued helping her meet demand, with her father cooking meals and her husband learning to monogram =2010‚Äì12: Expansion= As the company's fortunes grew, Temple did not think she could handle the continued growth of the company and decided to sell it for a million dollars. Temple was introduced to a banker in Charlotte, who in turn put her in touch with Shana Fisher, a New York venture capitalist who had started her own firm, High Line Venture Partners, that had been an early funder of successful startups like MakerBot, Vine and Pinterest. Fisher told Temple she had significantly undervalued LWD. Fisher believed it could be worth as much as $100 million. and then invested $100,000 and arranged a seed round of financing several months later that raised $1.4 million, enough for Fisher to move production from Temple's home into a former tire warehouse in Lexington. Now capitalized, Lolly Wolly Doodle was still short staffed and increased their staff nearly tenfold over the next two years. In the executive suite, Emily Hickey, formerly of HotJobs, became LWD's chief operating officer. She subsequently brought even more veterans of e-commerce into the company. Growth continued to the point that it was necessary to expand from the old tire warehouse to a facility by September 2012. By that time, the company had achieved 300,000 Facebook fans. =2013‚Äì2017: Revolution investment= Business and tech media began to take notice of not only Lolly Wolly Doodle's success but how it had accomplished it, succeeding on Facebook when larger, older companies like JCPenney had quietly withdrawn highly touted but unprofitable sales operations from the site during the same time LWD had taken off. Kara Swisher wrote about Temple and LWD a few months after the move. \\"Essentially, Temple is doing a modified version of a flash sale, but with just-in-time retail elements,\\" she observed. At the beginning of 2013, Business Insider named Temple and Hicks to its list of \\"30 Startup People To Watch This Year.\\" By the end of the year, the writers suggested, \\"we bet a lot more people will know about Temple and her company.\\" In June, that prediction was borne out when Steve Case, founder of America Online (AOL), invested $20 million in LWD through his venture capital firm, Revolution LLC. He called the company \\"a classic viral brand that resonated with its audience.\\" He and another former AOL executive, Donn Young, took positions on LWD's board of directors. As Fisher's investment had two years earlier, the money primarily enabled an expansion to yet another larger production facility later that summer, this time a building that had been vacant for many years. The company also released a mobile app and began selling its clothing through Instagram and Pinterest as well. For that year the company's revenues were $11 million. By the time Inc. ran a cover story on Temple and Lolly Wolly Doodle in mid-2014, the company had grown to four facilities, including one in New York City that handled the company's technology, and 250 employees. It had 900,000 Facebook fans. The company's main project for the year was the coding and implementation of customized software to improve the structure of design and sales data and better integrate the supply chain, production and warehouse operations. In September 2017 Lolly Wolly Doodle was purchased by Dan Frydenlund, chairman and CEO of the investment firm Stage Fund. Sherry Frydenlund took over as CEO. The company has since undergone a complete restructuring and is positioned for growth once again. =2018: Outsourcing= Lolly Wolly Doodle discontinued manufacturing in Lexington, NC and moved most of the manufacturing overseas, and moved operation to other US cities, including Atlanta. Business model While it sells product through several online channels, including its own website and other social networks, LWD by some estimates does 80% of its business through its Facebook page. Temple claims the company does more business on the site than any other, and no independent analysis has suggested otherwise. Its 900,000 fans are not the most of any retailer‚ÄîZappos counts 1.5 million‚Äîbut are disproportionately large compared to its overall size. Since larger, established retailers have mostly been unable to generate significant sales from their Facebook presence, e-commerce analysts have studied Lolly Wolly Doodle's business model in detail to understand how it has come to work. Retailers such as JCPenneyopened Facebook stores in 2010. The site provided an extra tab for users to click if they wanted to buy something. Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research likened this to \\"trying to sell stuff to people while they're hanging out with their friends at the bar.\\" However, Inc. later noted, JCPenney, which quietly closed its Facebook store within a year and returned to simply using its page for marketing purposes, was in fact \\"[not] asking people to shop at the bar; it was asking people to leave the bar and go to another tab, whereas Temple was essentially setting up trunk shows in the bar.\\" Once the order is processed, the garment is actually manufactured. The company uses the just-in- time production method: Donn Davis, a former America Online executive now on LWD's board, says that Temple has \\"reinvent[ed] apparel much as Dell reinvented the PC industry. It's affordable custom [manufacturing] in real time with little inventory risk.\\" The real advantage to LWD from Facebook, analysts believe, is not in order processing or production, although those do benefit from the use of the site. Instead it is the effects of the social feedback loop it creates on the company's marketing and inventory management, a practice that dates to the company's origins as Temple's hobby. When she first started selling on Facebook, she focused less on growing sales and more on building relationships with her customers that included listening to them closely about what they wanted. This, Inc. says, \\"eliminated much of the guesswork of merchandising.\\" According to Temple, \\"[w]hen something went crazy, I would go really deep into that style and those colors,\\" she says. \\"And if it didn't [sell], then forget it. I didn't make it again. We would fill whatever orders we got and move on to something else.\\" This practice continues today. This almost-instant feedback eliminates the need for the company to spend money on market research. \\"You're able to see what sells, why it sells, hear directly from [customers] and engage with them,\\" Temple told Bloomberg News in 2013. New designs that sell quickly are moved into larger- scale production and displayed on the company's website, with pre-customized versions of proven long-term successes outsourced to plants in China and Latin America. This, the company's only overseas production, accounts for 30% of its output. It is unlikely to increase as the company's success has resulted from being close to its primary market. \\"It's no coincidence that Lolly Wolly Doodle is made in the U.S.\\", observes Mulpuru. As a result of this feedback loop and short supply chain, LWD does not have the overstock problems that beset larger, traditional clothing retailers, with accumulations of unsold product on shelves and in warehouses. While warning that LWD's system isn't perfect‚Äî\\"[t]here are all kinds of early demand indicators that could be wrong\\"‚ÄîMulpuru sees much upside. \\"[Y]our chances of picking a hit are going to be better, and you will have fewer markdowns.\\" The experience also informs future design choices, making the company smarter. \\"We don't plan two seasons ahead,\\" Temple says. It also limits the possible variations it might make on an item‚Äîa \\"pod\\", in company parlance‚Äîto keep manufacturing complexity down. Hicks, Temple's chief operating officer, says this puts the company alongside European fast fashion successes like H&M; and Zara. Davis believes LWD's business model can be applied to many other products besides children's clothing. \\"[T]he first step is to become the leading company there,\\" he told Inc. \\"And the second step is ... to add new brands on top of it that go into other segments\\" such as clothing for adults, which the company is beginning to do, and home goods. Other companies have begun to imitate it, such as Combatant Gentleman, whose business clothing for young men has found a Facebook following. A San Francisco startup called Soldsie, whose founder was inspired by Temple and Lolly Wolly Doodle, does over a million dollars worth of transactions each month for similarly small businesses online. Outside observers have praised what Temple and LWD have done. \\"\\"I have an e-commerce crush on Lolly Wolly Doodle,\\", Will Young, the director of Zappos Labs, told Inc. \\"[They have] been able to do something that no big brand has been able to do, which is to convince people to actually buy on Facebook.\\" Mulpuru suggests other companies should \\"[get] their heads out of their asses\\" and at the very least emulate the way the company has tapped the ability of social media to help it understand its audience and make products less likely to fail in the marketplace. There have been some reservations expressed, however. Bloomberg notes that it works because \\"sales have been small enough to manage through the comment section on posts, and supply is limited, prompting users to act fast to snap up available inventory.\\" Temple suggests that it has worked due to LWD's \\"relatively modest\\" scale. The company's requirement that customers post their email addresses in comments to order \\"could invite inappropriate use of the information.\\" Brands Dress made by Lolly Wolly Doodle The company uses the Lolly Wolly Doodle name for most of its lines. For girls, it makes primarily dresses and capri sets, with a few swimwear pieces. Boys' clothing from LWD is primarily shortalls, T-shirt sets and bathing trunks. An extensive babywear line is complemented with tops, skirts and dresses (primarily maxi length) for adult women. The only other label LWD puts out is Designed by Me, for customized clothing. Users of the website choose details of a girls' dress; it is then made and shipped to them within three weeks. A Facebook login is required.

Gamboa is best known for making the Philippine flag hoisted during the inauguration of the revolutionary government of the Visayas in Santa Barbara, Iloilo.Women in the Philippine Revolution (1998). Ateneo de Manila University p.366 Early life Patrocinio Gamboa was born on 30 April 1865 in Jaro, Iloilo, Philippines to Ferm√≠n Gamboa and Leonila Villareal. She was baptized on 7 May 1865 at Jaro Church by Francisco Ag√ºer√≠a, and her godmother was Severina Gamboa. Her wealthy parents provided private tutors for her education. Gamboa was an avid reader of Spanish classics and newspapers. She was also deeply influenced by the literary works of the Propaganda Movement. Being the daughter of a wealthy and prominent family, she was well known in the community. She was devoutly religious, independent-minded, and brave of heart.Patrocinio Gamboa(1865 - 1953) Revolutionary ‚ÄúHeroine of Jaro‚Äù Web Article Philippine Revolution against Spain Among the first to join the revolution, Tia Patron was one of the organizers of the Comite Central Revolucionario de Visayas (\\"Central Revolutionary Committee of the Visayas\\"), which formed the nucleus of what later became the Revolutionary Government of the Visayas. She nursed wounded and sick soldiers in the battlefield. She also collected war contributions from the Chinese in Iloilo and gathered food and medical supplies, arms, and ammunition for the revolutionary forces. For this, she was considered as the ‚ÄúHeroine of Jaro.‚ÄùIlonggo in History: Patrocinio Gamboa, Heroine of Jaro Web News Article History mixes her story of heroism with comedy. On 17 November 1898, the revolutionary government of the Visayas was to be inaugurated. Such an occasion called for a flag. The women of Jaro prepared a replica of the flag made by Marcela Agoncillo for General Emilio Aguinaldo in Hong Kong. The problem lay in its delivery to the Santa Barbara headquarters of General Martin Delgado. Between the two towns were Spanish guards shooting anyone suspected as being in league with the revolutionary forces. They thoroughly inspected civilians passing along the roads. Gamboa and a young lieutenant, Honorio Solinap, volunteered for the task. Gamboa wrapped the revolutionary flag around her waist, concealing it within her garments. The two went off as a husband and wife delivering hay in a carriage. A saber, a gift of General Aguinaldo to General Delgado, lay concealed under the hay. The carriage came upon a roadblock and the two faced danger. To divert the attention of the guards, Gamboa staged a husband and wife quarrel with herself as a domineering wife, berating an unfortunate, weak husband. As she shouted and cursed the subdued man, she also pinched, bit and boxed him. They acted their parts so convincingly that the guards, overwhelmed with laughter, allowed them pass. They delivered the flag in time for the inaugural ceremonies.Philippine Heroines of the Revolution: Maria Clara they were not Yoder, Robert L.,FAPC. Web ArticleIloilo Nationalism Iloilo Nationalism.

[and] to let the rest of the University community know the full message of Christianity so that others can come to believe and have faith in Jesus Christ.\\" Founded in 1931 by Dr. Donald B. Fullerton, a member of the Princeton University Class of 1913, the PCF is one of the oldest campus ministries of its type, predating the founding of Campus Crusade and Intervarsity by a decade or more. PCF is one of the largest student organizations at Princeton University, and is currently led by the Rev. Dr. William Boyce, a member of the Princeton Class of 1979. Early history P-Rade (date uncertain, likely late 1970s). From 1825 until its demise amid controversy in 1930 the Philadelphian Society was the center of Evangelical religious life on campus. This left a lack of organized evangelical ministry at Princeton and the next year a friend of Donald Fullerton called him worried over the hard time his son was having spiritually as a student. Dr. Fullerton had previously served as a Plymouth Brethren missionary on the northwest frontier of British India, the border regions of modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan, but was forced off the mission field by ill health. He made an attempt to return to the mission field in 1929, sailing out on the RMS Mauretania. He prayed that God would turn the ship around if it was not His will that he return to the mission field. While still in New York harbor the Mauretania collided with a car float forcing a return to dock and signaling to Dr. Fullerton that his days of overseas service were at an end. John Frame '61, Jim Renick '60, Suthy MacLean '58, Ken Petzinger '63, Bob Shade '60, Ron Furst '63, Bruce Higgins '60, Bart Campbell '62, Jerry Butler '60. Six became missionaries and one a theologian. This enabled Dr. Fullerton to respond to the request of his friend by starting to hold Bible classes on the campus, which replaced the defunct Philadelphian Society and which he would continue for fifty years. These informal Bible classes grew into a formal organization in 1937, with PCF's first undergraduate president, A.G. Fletcher Jr. a member of the Princeton Class of 1938, announcing: > A group of us have felt for a number of years the need on this Campus of a > society with a fundamental Christian position ... [we] feel that the fine > Christian tradition on which Princeton was founded is not entirely dead > today and that there are still many undergraduates in the University whose > senses are awake to the higher, eternal values in life, and who would > welcome an opportunity to strengthen and reaffirm these convictions in a > collective way through congenial fellowship with others holding similar > views ... We wish to emphasize that the P. E. F. was not formed in > opposition to any of the religious organizations already existing on the > Campus. Our intention has never been to oppose, but rather to supplement > these other programs by supplying elements which we feel have been > neglected. Notable early members of the PCF include Judge Paul Pressler, who was a key figure in the conservative resurgence of the Southern Baptist Convention, and Jack Whitcomb, led to faith as a freshman by Dr. Fullerton and a leading young earth creationist. In 1947, the same year the PCF held its first alumni reunion, the fellowship hosted a showing of The God of Creation, a film created by the Moody Institute. One member of the audience of two hundred was Albert Einstein to whom the young Dr. Whitcomb handed a Gospel tract. Another notable PCF alumnus from its early decades is the noted Reformed theologian John Frame a member of the Princeton Class of 1960. He said of his time in the fellowship that: > Fullerton and PEF cared deeply about people, spending hours in mutual > prayer, exhortation, counseling, gospel witness ... And they made me a much > better follower of Jesus. I will never regret being part of this semi- > Arminian, dispensationalist, separatist, tee-totaling, semi-victorious life, > pietistic, biblicistic group called PEF. And the greatest part of that > experience was the godly example of Donald B. Fullerton. He was not a > perfect man, but I am yet today an imitator of his, since he imitated Jesus. Growth and Change Retreat. The fellowship has grown steadily over time, with under 30 members in 1959, up to 70 by the 1978, and 150 by the late 90s. It now includes a dedicated graduate student ministry, the Graduate Princeton Christian Fellowship. PCF's members have included several Princeton University valedictorians, salutatorians, and two young alumni trustees among recipients of many other university awards. According to one source PCF's alumni include \\"prominent seminary professors, scientists, denominational leaders, influential authors, as well as missionaries in more than twenty-five countries. As an independent group from a single university, the PCF has contributed more leaders to the Christian world than probably any other Christian college group.\\" PCF has a long tradition of baptizing students on Easter Sunday morning in conjunction with other campus ministries and under the authority of Stone Hill Church of Princeton. The fellowship also has long associations with members of the Princeton faculty, most notably the work of Dr. James Rankin in mentoring students and playing piano and keyboard with the fellowship's worship team. Over its more than eighty years of existence the PCF has seen many changes. The hymn books of earlier years gave way to guitars and contemporary worship music. Suits and ties have given way to shorts and flip-flops, and the introduction of coeducation to Princeton in 1969 ended the days when the fellowship was exclusively male. Despite the many changes over the decades PCF continues to be cited by students and alumni as a principal life influence. Dr. Justin Hastings of the Princeton Class of 2001 wrote at the end of his senior year: > The Princeton Evangelical Fellowship was the reason I came to Princeton ... > Now, four years later, PEF is most assuredly the best thing to happen to me > at Princeton ... PEF has prepared me morally and spiritually for life after > Princeton, much more so than any class I've taken here over the past four > years. In the fall of 2017 the ministry changed its name to Princeton Christian Fellowship, due to the perception that the term 'evangelical' had too much of a political connotation rather than a theological one, with Boyce stating \\"There might be certain assumptions that all evangelicals are Republicans\\".

The company had plans for a railroad connection, but no such connection was ever built. The initial settlement was unsuccessful, but the town revived in the 1890s with the purported discovery of gold in the surrounding hills. A three-year gold rush ensued, and the town grew as miners searched for gold along the Smoky Hill River. The hotel reopened and a bridge was built across the river into the settlement.

This list includes dishes in which the main ingredient or one of the essential ingredients is eggplant. Eggplant or aubergine is used in the cuisine of many countries. It is often stewed, as in the French ratatouille, or deep fried as in the Italian parmigiana di melanzane, the Turkish karnƒ±yarƒ±k or Turkish and Greek musakka/moussaka, and Middle-Eastern and South Asian dishes. Eggplants can also be battered before deep-frying and served with a sauce made of tahini and tamarind. In Iranian cuisine, it is blended with whey as kashk e-bademjan, tomatoes as mirza ghasemi or made into stew as khoresh-e-bademjan. It can be sliced and deep-fried, then served with plain yogurt, (optionally) topped with a tomato and garlic sauce, such as in the Turkish dish patlƒ±can kƒ±zartmasƒ± (meaning: fried aubergines) or without yogurt as in patlƒ±can ≈üak≈üuka. Perhaps the best-known Turkish eggplant dishes are imam bayƒ±ldƒ± (vegetarian) and karnƒ±yarƒ±k (with minced meat). Eggplant dishes Fried aubergine Karnƒ±yarƒ±k is a Turkish dish consisting of eggplant stuffed with a mix of saut√©ed chopped onions, garlic, black pepper, tomatoes, parsley and ground meat. Rollatini is an Italian-style dish usually made with thin slices of eggplant that are dusted in wheat flour or lightly breaded, covered with ricotta and often other cheeses and seasonings, then rolled up and baked. * AjapsandaliBurford T. 2008, Georgia, Bradt Travel Guide, p. 69. * Alinazik kebab * Baba ghanoushEncyclopedia of Jewish Food - Gil Marks * Badrijani * Baghara baingan * Baingan bharta * Beguni * Berenjenas de Almagro, a pickled aubergine characteristic of \\"Manchega\\" cuisine from the Castile-La Mancha region of Spain, specifically from Almagro, a city in the Ciudad Real province of Spain. * Bruschetta * Cacciatore * Caponata * Confit byaldi * Dahi baigana * Di san xian * Eggplant salads and appetizers ‚Äì includes many dishes from various cultures * Escalivada * Fried aubergine * Garlic sauce * H√ºnk√¢rbeƒüendi * ƒ∞mam bayƒ±ldƒ±The Armenian Table Cookbook: 165 treasured recipes that bring together ... - Victoria Jenanyan Wise. p. 56. * Israeli eggplant salad * Karnƒ±yarƒ±k * Kashk e bademjan * KyopolouBulgaria: The Bradt Travel Guide - Annie Kay. p. 53. * Lasagna * Malidzano * Mirza-Qasemi * Moussaka * Parmigiana * Pasta * Pasta alla Norma * Patlƒ±can kebabƒ± * Patlƒ±canlƒ± kebap * Pesto * Pinƒëur * Pisto * Pizza * Ratatouille * Rellenong talong * Rollatini * Sabich * Stuffed eggplant * Tepsi baytinijan * Terong Balado * Tortang talong * Tombet * T√ºrl√º * Zaalouk * ZacuscƒÉ File:Baba ganoush and pita.jpgBaba ghanoush is a Levantine dish of cooked eggplant mixed with onions, tomatoes, olive oil and various seasonings.

It was first published in Omni in May 1987, and subsequently republished in The Year's Best Science Fiction (fifth edition); in Best New SF 2; in Omni Visions One; in The Penguin Book of Modern Fantasy By Women; in Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora; in Daughters of Earth: Feminist Science Fiction in the Twentieth Century; in Crucified Dreams; in Butler's collection Bloodchild and Other Stories, and as a chapbook from Pulphouse Publishing.Bibliography: the Evening and the Morning and the Night, at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database; retrieved June 11, 2014 Synopsis Decades after the introduction of a cancer cure, the children of its users develop \\"Duryea-Gode Disease\\" (DGD), a genetic disease whose symptoms include dissociative states, obsessive self-mutilation, and violent psychosis. DGD patients can delay the onset of symptoms by means of rigid dietary restrictions. However, the intense social isolation they face, as well as the knowledge that the eventual onset of symptoms is inevitable, makes some of the second-generation patients wonder whether these efforts are worth it. Lynn, the female protagonist, is a double DGD (she has the disease from both her parents), and learns how to deal with the disease and the oppression that she felt since she was growing up. She witnesses what DGDs are capable of when she visits Dilg, a retreat center where the out-of-control DGDs are placed. At Dilg the patients are not restrained, but instead are improving themselves by being artistically creative. In an afterword to the story, Butler described constructing DGD from the symptoms of three other genetic diseases: Huntington's disease, phenylketonuria, and Lesch-Nyhan disease, to which she added reactivity to pheromones and the delusion of being trapped in one's own flesh.Bloodchild and Other Stories, by Octavia Butler, published 1995 by Four Walls Eight Windows Themes \\"The Evening and the Morning and the Night\\" presents an atmosphere governed by social exclusion due to the affliction of DGD. A DGD patient's requirement to wear an emblem marks them as a liability to standard social constructs. Since DGD is an illness that facilitates self-mutilation and maniacal episodes of violence, people tend to stay away from those affected by the disease. This distance created by others not affected by this disease naturally causes prejudice and marginalization. Ultimately, the emblem DGD carriers wear signifies a population oppressed not only by their own genetic mutation, but also by the rest of society.Bast, Florian. \\"I Hugged Myself\\": First-Person Narration as an Agential Act in Octavia Butler's \\"The Evening and the Morning and the Night\\", in Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century.

Each of the groups feel better interacting with their members. By law people with DGD are removed from their city and placed in a facility where disease sufferers are entrapped into their own world and labeled as if they were delinquents.Lavender, Isiah, III. \\"Digging Deep: Ailments of Difference in Octavia Butler's \\"The Evening and the Morning and the Night\\".\\" Black and Brown Planets: The Politics of Race in Science Fiction.

Cat√°logo taxon√≥mico de especies de M√©xico. 1. In Capital Nat. M√©xico. CONABIO, Mexico City These bushes occupy a variety of habitats in their range, including washes, gravelly or sandy slopes, shrubland, and woodland, often growing intermixed with other shrubs. The range extends from the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada and the deserts of California, east to Texas and south into Mexico. They are relatively common; although both the foliage and flowers are sparse, the distinctive pattern of bags makes them easy to spot from a distance. Description =Growth pattern= This plant takes the form of a rounded shrub, typically 50‚Äì100 cm high, sometimes larger. =Stems and leaves= The stems form a spreading rigid pattern, with the tips often becoming spine-like. The branching pattern is distinctive, with opposite side branches forming right angles to the main stem. The plant drops its leaves in dry conditions (drought deciduous). The leaves are opposite, small, 3‚Äì15 mm long and 2‚Äì8 mm wide, ovate to elliptic, have smooth edges (entire), and with a very short or nonexistent petiole.Shreve, F. & I. L. Wiggins. 1964. Vegetation and Flora of the Sonoran Desert 2 vols. Stanford University Press, Stanford =Inflorescence and fruit= The 2-lipped flowers develop in pairs facing away from each other; the upper lip is white to light violet and hairy, while the lower lip is 3-lobed and intense dark violet. The calyx starts out as simply a base to the flower, reddish-purple in shade, and then as the flower ages, it expands into its distinctive bag shape, 1‚Äì2 cm across, the dried flower eventually falling out of the hole in the end. The fruit inside the dried calyx bags is composed of 4 nutlets. The plant drops its leaves in dry conditions (drought deciduous). The dried bags help with seed dispersal by wind. Flowering is generally April through June, but the bags are durable and may last on the plant into winter, becoming dry and papery.

It is romanized as Chi in Wade‚ÄìGiles, and Gwai in Cantonese. Ji is the 142nd most common surname in China, with a population of 960,000. It is listed the 134th in the Song dynasty classic text Hundred Family Surnames. Etymology In ancient usage, the characters of meng (Â≠ü), zhong (‰ª≤), shu (Âèî) and ji (Â≠£) were used to denote the first, second, third and fourth eldest sons in a family. The Chinese character Ji Â≠£ is composed of two parts: Á¶æ (grain) and Â≠ê (son), and originally means \\"young grain\\". Later it acquired the meaning of \\"the youngest\\", and was frequently used in the name or title of the youngest son (or daughter) of a family. It is from this usage that the character became a surname. According to analysis based on the early 11th-century dictionary Guangyun, in Middle Chinese the character was pronounced [kwi]. Demographics As of 2008, Ji Â≠£ is the 142nd most common surname in China, shared by 960,000 people, or 0.077% of the Chinese population. It is concentrated in East China, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. Jiangsu province alone accounts for 44% of the people surnamed Ji Â≠£, followed by Zhejiang with 10%. Origins The main origin of the Ji Â≠£ surname is the state of Lu during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. Prince You was commonly called Ji You (Â≠£Âèã) as he was the youngest son of Duke Huan of Lu. After the death of his older brother Duke Zhuang of Lu, Ji You helped Duke Zhuang's son to ascend the throne as Duke Xi of Lu, and he became Duke Xi's chief minister. He was the founding patriarch of the Jisun clan, the most powerful of the Three Huan clans that dominated the politics of Lu for centuries to come. His descendants adopted Jisun, which was later shortened to Ji, as their surname. This source of Ji Â≠£ is a branch of Ji Âß¨, the ancestral surname of the dukes of Lu. A second origin of the Ji surname was Jilian (Â≠£ÈÄ£), the first recorded ruler of the state of Chu. This origin of Ji is a branch of Mi Ëäà, the royal surname of Chu. Several other states of the Zhou dynasty, such as Qi and Wei, also had noble lineages that adopted Ji Â≠£ as their surname. Later adoption During the Ming and Qing dynasties, several Mongol and Manchu clans adopted the Ji surname, and many Ji-surnamed people in Northeast China are from this origin.

Wilsun named his labor of love Red Sky because one day he was putting up flyers for his Poetry Theatre in the Pike Place Market and as he was doing so, saw an amazing red sunset.

Red Sky Poetry Theatre considered its collective efforts to be more conducive to the creative process, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Essentially, Open Sky wasn't edited so much as compiled. Shively's brainchild, Open Sky, eventually became a quarterly publication. The only person to submit to all twelve issues of Open Sky was author Dann O'Keefe.Irish Writing Online, \\"Unpublishable? Do It Yourself\\" accessed June 25, 2014 Open Sky became Open Sound in 1989 with 200 pages. Ezra Mark was the editor of the first Open Sound.

Charlie Burks added a 'Sunday Supplement' one month when he was guest editor that was much admired by the Pacific Northwest literary public. Trudy Mercer took over the compilation of this monthly magazine in 1984. Mercer published Redlines as well as working with Red Sky Poetry Theatre. SkyViews was renamed Parallel Discourse in 1989 with Phoebe Bosch√© and James Maloney as editors although it still referred to itself as SkyViews inside the first Parallel Discourse pages.Up In The Air, Parallel Discourse (SkyViews Volume 3 Numbers 4/5) combined issue, January, 1989, Page 5 Parallel Discourse soon spun off of Red Sky Poetry Theatre completely and was solely published by Bosch√© and Maloney. Swale Magazine was edited by Bosch√© and Roberto Valenza but it was not actually a Red Sky Poetry Theatre publication. Swale was well received. Red Sky Poetry Theatre also had its own imprint called, of course, Red Sky Press. It published books of collected poets such as Red Sky Morning as well as publishing the Bumbershoot Anthology, a collection of the poems of the Bumbershoot Literary Contest performers, in 1984 and 1985. Visual Art was always part of the Red Sky Poetry Theatre milieu and many publications were replete with images such as the art of Keppler, Lennon,Stephen J.

Red Sky Poetry Theatre presented a continuous live poetry series for more than the 25 years that it was incorporated. This puts Red Sky Poetry Theatre on the same par as City Lights Books, which has been running a poetry series since 1953, and Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which has had a series since 1973.

Red Sky Poetry Theatre board membership changed much over the course of 25 incorporated years. Red Sky Poetry Theatre held their first readings at the Soames Dunn Building in the Pike Place Market and continued there for more than a year, then moving to the Pike Development Authority meeting room for 6 months.Donn Fry, \\"Take a Reading: Seattle's lively poetry scene provides listeners with a wealth of vibrant verse\\", Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer, April 13, 1986 Page L-1, 7 From there, Red Sky Poetry Theatre stayed in the Pike Place Market and started reading in December, 1983 at the Soup and Salad Cafe overlooking Puget Sound. This was the first venue where people who weren't looking for Red Sky Poetry Theatre could come across them and walk in. Michael Hureaux, who was an active member of Red Sky Poetry Theatre, was the instigator that convinced Red Sky Poetry Theatre to move to the Five-O Tavern on Capitol Hill in December 1984, thus changing the ambiance of the performance stage, when the Soup and Salad turned into the Soundview Cafe. Hureaux had already staged Poem People: Poetry Night at the Five-O Tavern and found the location conducive to poetry. (The Five-O later became the Hopvine Pub). The Five-O was an early venue for the fledgling Seattle Grunge Rock scene.Clark Humphrey, Metropolist 150, Misc Media,, October 16, 2001, Page 15, accessed June 11, 2014 It is among venues where the influence of Steven Jesse Bernstein,IMDB I'm Secretly an Important Man, accessed May 27, 2014Preliminary Guide to the Jeff Stookey and Jesse Bernstein Papers 1950-2010, accessed June 1, 2014 on Grunge first occurred.James Sanford, \\"'Godfather of grunge': Documentary examines Seattle poet Steven Bernstein's life\\", Kalamazoo Gazette, accessed June 11, 2014 Bernstein had been reading at Dogtown Poetry Theater prior to Red Sky Poetry Theatre and was always an influence in Seattle and the West Coast.Cydney Gillis, \\"Remembering poet Jesse Bernstein\\", Real Change News Vol: 17 No: 40, September 29, 2010, accessed June 9, 2014Daniel Enoch Tobin, Steven Jessie Bernstein History, Scribd, accessed June 1, 2014 Hureaux left the board in 1986 to pursue other interests,Trisha Ready, \\"Marxist Circus The Art and Politics of Michael Perez- Hureaux\\" The Stranger, September 12, 2002, accessed June 7, 2014 including becoming a member of the Choreopoets.Ferdinand M.

Members worked with On the Boards performing in the 1982 Poetry Marathon to benefit Amnesty International.Tony Seldin, Vagabond Poet Program Notes, 100 Poets Read to Benefit Amnesty International; it's a Poetry Marathon, December 5, 1982 Matt Lennon hosted a monthly reading at the Comet Tavern, where Red Sky Poetry Theatre would cross pollinate with the Actor's Table.

It was this flexibility which made it so easy to move venues as needed without harming the free-spirited, collaborative nature of Red Sky Poetry Theatre.

Red Sky Poetry Theatre went through many venues after it left the Five-O Tavern in the late 1980s. It moved to the Cause Celebre Cafe, also on Capitol Hill, for a few months, then moved to the Still Life Cafe in Fremont, 'The Center of the Universe'. It moved to Anna's Cafe briefly.Gillian G. Gaar, \\"Scratches\\" Builds Explosive Outburst, Arts Focus Volume 3 Number 4, December 1988, Page 2 From there Red Sky Poetry Theatre moved around but landed at Squid Row in the late 1980s. It showed in other venues, as well, moving in 1990 to the Ditto Tavern in Belltown, Seattle. Once the Ditto Tavern folded, Red Sky Poetry Theatre moved back up to Capitol Hill to the Globe Cafe.

Although he started his career as a draftsman and watercolorist, Pavia ultimately made his mark with a body of work that spanned all-abstract bronzes, black-and- white abstractions in Carrara marble and, just prior to his death in 2005, at aged 94, a dozen monumental terracotta heads. Best known for his large-scale assemblages and scatter sculpture, Pavia's work has been installed on the grounds of several major public sites. He was one of four chosen to help sculpt 10 pieces for New York City's first Sculpture Symposium at the Cooper Hewitt Museum of Design in 1971. His independent installations included the 10-foot-high marble abstraction Wind, Sand and Stars, installed at New York's Cloisters Museum, and the Ides of March, which stood on Sixth Avenue, outside of the New York Hilton, for nearly 25 years. Called an \\"outspoken avant-garde thinker\\" by the Boston Globe, Pavia decided to organize regular gatherings of artists, writers and thinkers to socialize and discuss modern art in 1948. The result, inspired by the salons of Paris and post-war desire for art that wasn't borrowed from Europe, was the 8th Street Club, known as \\"the Club,\\" and its 1959-1970 successor group, known as the \\"23rd Street Workshop Club.\\" Many of New York's most important mid-century artists and thinkers were Club-goers, including Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Isamu Noguchi and Robert Motherwell. Together, they helped lend New York's art scene the vitality and international influence Paris had long monopolized, and U.S. artists had long craved. In 1958, Pavia extended the Club's work into a journal, with the short-lived but influential It is. A Magazine for Abstract Art.  Education  After two years at Yale studying architecture, Pavia transferred to the Art Students League of New York in 1931, which is where he met life-long friend, fellow abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock. He alternated his New York studies, with travel and studies in Europe, where he met Henry Miller. He settled in New York City permanently in 1937, and along with \\"Bill de Kooning, Landes Lewitin, Franz Kline, Jack Tworkov, and a few others,\\" worked as a Federal Art Project artist, an experience he described as an important training ground both for the group that pioneered abstract expressionism: > Imagine thousands of artists in all forty-eight states getting paid to work > as artists. They really learned how to paint during the program even though > everyone was doing all kinds of things; making caricatures, cartoons, > illustrations‚Äîit didn‚Äôt matter. That was the point: they were practicing, > training themselves, so that when Abstract Expressionism came around they > were ready. If it weren‚Äôt for the WPA we wouldn‚Äôt have had artists coming > together like that. When the war was over in 1945, all of a sudden it was a > different story.  The Club  In 1948, Pavia helped found the Club, envisioning regular debate about issues in art during twice-weekly lectures, members-only panel conversations and other events. Established shortly after the war, the Club was, in part, a response to American artists intimidated by the modernists who had taken refuge in New York after the war. \\"[T]here were geniuses walking in the streets, you know. About 30 of them,\\" Pavia told the New York Times in 2002. \\"They included Piet Mondrian, Max Ernst, Josef Albers, Marcel Breuer, Yves Tanguy, Andr√© Breton and Marcel Duchamp. Matisse came for a visit and everybody lined up to see him.... Eventually, [Pavia] says, the refugees moved uptown, and the Americans decided to take them on.\\" First Pollock rejected surrealism and Jungian imagery, then de Kooning followed suit. After a series of Club lectures on expressionism and abstraction, ideas from both started to merge, and America's first major home-grown abstract art movement was on its way. \\"The Club was a schoolhouse of sorts,\\" writes Devin M. Brown, for Burnaway the online Atlanta-based arts magazine, after reviewing Pavia's Archive of Abstract and Expressionist Art at (MARBL), the Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory University, which owns the collection,\\" but it was also a theater, a gallery space, and a dancehall.... [T]he collection demonstrates how various media constantly overlapped whether simply through discussion or in performance. Concerts, dances, and theatrical pieces were all hosted there. Poets, composers, painters, sculptors, filmmakers, and critics all rubbed elbows and argued with each other about aesthetics at the Club‚Äôs many panel discussions....\\" \\"Debates at the Club covered a variety of art- and philosophy-related topics, bringing in non- members like Hannah Arendt, Joseph Campbell and John Cage, among others,\\" and bringing together Abstractionists and Expressionists, which helped lend currency to the term \\"Abstract-Expressionism.\\" Art members included Elaine de Kooning, Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell, Landes Lewitin, Aristodimos Kaldis, and Leo Castelli. Brown cites Club Without Walls: Selections from the Journals of Philip Pavia, when recalling Pavia's observation, ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt for our persistent gatherings, I am sure we would have all become loners and faded away.‚Äù It is. A Magazine for Abstract Art Issue No. 3 of the magazine, featuring work by Robert Motherwell, 1959. In 1956, Pavia resigned from the Club and, in the spring of 1958, published the first edition of It is. A Magazine for Abstract Art, as another way to exchange ideas in the Arts. The magazine was used as a forum to discuss ideas of the day, and to champion emerging artists, such as Allan Kaprow, Robert Rauschenberg, Helen Frankenthaler, and John Chamberlain as well as already established ones. The self-described \\"partisan publisher\\" also used it to advocate for neglected forms of art, and writing an open letter to Leslie Katz, the new publisher of Arts Magazine, in 1959, which said: \\"I am begging you to give the representational artist a better deal. The neglected representational and near-abstract artists, not the abstractionists, need a champion these days.\\" Elaine de Kooning supported his project and while she was teaching in New Mexico, she spread the word about the publication while serving as a judge on an art show and with local museums. Brooklyn Rail critic Phong Bui described the magazine's influence this way: \\"Although there were only six issues in its entirety‚Äîwith a circulation of 2000 in the first five and 8000 copies in the last, which was solely devoted to sculpture‚ÄîIt is is considered to be an indispensable document of American art of that period.\\"  Interviews  * Bui, Phong. \\"The Club IT IS: A Conversation with Philip Pavia.\\" Feb-March 2001: The Brooklyn Rail. * Hooten, Bruce. \\"Oral history interview with Philip Pavia, 1965 Jan. 19.\\" Archives of American Art. * Potter, Jeffrey. \\"Meet Your Neighbor.\\" Springs, NY, 1989.

It forms low mats of branched stems growing from a woody base. The leaves have small spines along their edges. The solitary yellow flowers are tubular with five free lobes at the end, the upper two pointing backwards, the lower three projecting forwards. The species is known only from about ten locations, most in the Titus Canyon and the adjacent Fall Canyon, all within the Californian section of Death Valley National Park. It grows in limestone crevices on the canyon walls, often on the north face. Description Holmgrenanthe petrophila is an herbaceous perennial with fibrous roots. It is low growing with slender, branched stems arising from a woody base; as it often grows on vertical faces, the stems tend to hang down. Close relatives climb using twining leaf stalks (petioles), but H. petrophila has straight petioles, long. The leaves are rounded or kidney shaped with small spines or bristles along the margins (spinulose) and at the apex. They are long by wide. In its native habitat, H. petrophila flowers and fruits in spring and early summer, between April and June. The solitary flowers are borne on very short stalks (peduncles), only long. The green sepals are narrow, pointed and not joined, forming an urn shape around the base of the flower. They are long by wide at the base. They have small spines along their margins, like the leaves. The five petals forming the corolla are joined at their bases to form a tube long. The free lobes at the end of the flower are long and differentiated into two upper lobes, curving backwards, and three lower lobes, pointing forwards. The color of the corolla has been described as either sulfur yellow throughout or white with a yellow throat. The style and stamens stay within the flower. The four stamens are of two lengths, the upper two with filaments long, the lower two with filaments long. There is also a fifth rudimentary sterile stamen. The ovary has a single chamber with an incomplete T-shaped septum. After fertilization, a globe shaped capsule forms containing tan colored seeds. Taxonomy The genus Holmgrenanthe was established in 1985 by Wayne J. Elisens solely for the species H. petrophila, previously placed in Maurandya (including Maurandella). Elisens considered the species sufficiently different from other members of Maurandya to warrant a new genus. For example, it has short mat-forming stems, rather than long climbing or scrambling stems; the edges of the leaves and sepals are spiny; the ovary has a single chamber rather than two. The generic name honors Arthur H., Noel H., and Patricia K. Holmgren, described by Elisens as \\"dedicated botanists and students of the western flora.\\" The genus is placed in the tribe Antirrhineae, originally part of the family Scrophulariaceae, but now in the Plantaginaceae. Within this tribe, Elisens defined the subtribe Maurandyinae for the five North American genera Holmgrenanthe, Lophospermum, Mabrya, Maurandya and Rhodochiton (the last of which he included in Lophospermum). =Phylogeny= Lack of relevant information has led to Holmgrenanthe being excluded from the molecular phylogenetic studies confirming that Elisen's Maurandyinae together with Asarina and Cymbalaria form a monophyletic group (clade), but analyses based on morphological characters suggest that Holmgrenanthe was the first diverging genus within the clade, retaining features of the earliest ancestor. The cladogram presented by Ghebrehiwet is shown below: =Species= The sole species in the genus, Holmgrenanthe petrophila, was first described in 1935 by Frederick Vernon Coville and Conrad Vernon Morton (as Maurandya petrophila). They did not explain the origin of the specific epithet, but petro- is derived from the Greek for rock and -phila from the Greek for beloved, so that petrophila means \\"rock-loving\\". The plants described by Coville and Morton were growing in a north facing vertical limestone wall in Titus Canyon in Death Valley, California. As noted above, the species was transferred to the new genus by Elisens in 1985. Distribution and habitat After the species was first discovered in Titus Canyon, further plants were found in the adjacent Fall Canyon. It is known only from about ten locations, mostly in these two canyons, all within the Californian section of Death Valley National Park. It grows in limestone crevices on the canyon walls, often on the north face, in areas dominated by creosote bush scrub. Elisens suggested that Holmgrenanthe petrophila might be a \\"paleoendemic\\", originally having a much larger range, but now confined to more sheltered and moister microhabitats in desert canyons as a consequence of a warming and drying trend 11,000‚Äì8,000 years ago. Conservation , Holmgrenanthe petrophila is listed by the California Native Plant Society as \\"rare, threatened, or endangered in California and elsewhere\\". It is listed as critically endangered by the California State but is not listed at the federal level in the United States, nor in the IUCN Red List.

The cause of these conflicts were due in part to the western expansion of the frontiersmen into Cherokee lands in western North Carolina. This particular conflict and the many that followed are known to historians as the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars or (Chickamauga Wars). Background The war began in the Summer of 1776. The conflicts arose in part due to the rapid expansion of European-American settlers into Cherokee lands, which caused the tribe concern. It began with a series of raids against the trans-Appalachian settlements. Battles Under the Command of General Griffith Rutherford, Captain William Moore led attacks against the Cherokee in July 1776 during an punitive expedition, destroying five Cherokee towns, killing around 50-60 Cherokees, and suffering only minor losses. During the expedition, Rutherford also led militia men to the town of Cowee. Being over-powered and out- numbered, the Cherokee people offered peace to the American People. This conflict was known as the \\"Battle of Cowee Gap.\\" After the destruction and loss that the Cherokee people endured, the majority of the Cherokee settlements signed the Treaty of Dewitt's Corner in 1777. Aftermath The Treaty of Dewitt's Corner did not stop all conflict between the American and the Cherokee peoples. In fact, groups of the Chickamauga band of the Cherokee led by Dragging Canoe refused to sign the treaty and continued attacks on the American settlements. A peaceful agreement with the Chickamauga Cherokees did not come until 1785 when the Treaty of Hopewell was signed. Regional conflicts between the American people and all Indigenous peoples in the eastern continental United States continued until the Indian Removal Act in 1830 led to the Trail of Tears.

It runs on Windows (MinGW and Visual Studio versions), Linux (X86 and X86-64), Mac OS X (10.7-10.13, X86 and X86-64), iOS and Android. General information Orx provides a complete game creation framework including a 3D scene graph, hardware accelerated 2D rendering, animation, input, sound, physics and much more. Its main goals are to allow fast game prototyping and creation. Orx is published under Zlib license. Features Despite being written in C, Orx has an object oriented design with a plugin architecture. This allows its kernel to be cross-platform and delegates hardware- and OS-dependent tasks to plugins. Most of these plugins are based on other open-source libraries, such as GLFW, SDL and Box2D. Build files are provided for GCC makefiles, Visual Studio (2015, 2017 & 2019), Codelite, Code::Blocks and Xcode. ;Orx contains most of the common game engine features: * automated sprite rendering using 3D hardware acceleration allowing: translations, anisotropic scale, rotation, transparency (alpha blending), coloring (multiply, add and subtract blends), tiling and mirroring * advanced resource management * Multiple Render Targets (MRT) and advance compositing support * geometric display primitives and textured mesh rendering * camera/viewport system allowing multiple views on one screen with camera translations, zooms and rotations * 3D scene graph used for object positioning, allowing grouped translations, rotations and scales * sound and music with volume, pitch and loop control * collision detection and rigid body physics and joints * animation system * event management * custom fragment (pixel) shader support * unicode support * custom bitmap font rendering * real time CPU profiler * interactive \\"debug\\" console * multi-monitor support * clipboard support ;It also provides more unusual features * object creation is data driven: managing resources requires very little code, everything is controlled through configuration files * during dev phases, resources can be automatically hotloaded at runtime upon modification on disk, shortening drastically iteration times * a clock system: this allows the user to keep time consistency everywhere, giving him the ability of doing local or global time stretching * an animation chaining graph: animation transitions are defined in a graph, this allows the code to request only the final target animation; all transitions will be automated depending on the starting animation * a custom animation event system: allows easy synchronization with parts of animations * a visual FX system: config-based combination of curves of sine, sawtooth and linear shapes that can be plugged on object properties: color, alpha, position, translation or rotation * a powerful resource system: allows users to easily abstract resource access and work with separated development files as well as packed ones for release builds, or even use different sets of resources on different platforms, without having to change a line of code * an automated differential scrolling: depth scaling and differential scrolling is controlled through config files, allowing differential parallax scrolling on any number of planes * a powerful configuration system: featuring inheritance, direct random control, encryption/decryption, filtered save and history reload. This allows the user to tweak almost everything without having to change a single line of code * a spawning system: this allows the user to easily create weapon bullets or, combined with the visual FX system, elaborate visual graphic effects * an easy UI object positioning system: helps supporting different aspect ratio and provides easy picking/selection framework * a generic input system: allows users to use any kind of controllers (mouse, joystick, keyboard, touch, accelerometer, ...) through an abstract layer. The user asks for input status using plain names, bindings being done in config files or on the fly for user input customization, for example * simple scripting via a combination of timelines and commands * multi-threading support with asynchronous resources loading and hotloading support ;The current list of WIP features that will be added in the future: * 3D rendering support * network support See also * Game engine * List of game engines * SFML * SDL * Box2D * GP2X * Codelite References External links * Orx Project Site * Git repository on GitHub.com * Mercurial repository on SourceForge.net * Orx wiki Category:Free game engines Category:Free software programmed in C Category:Software using the zlib license ","title":"ORX"},{"id":"43031738","text":"Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes were the defending champions, but did not participate together.

DISIP was established in March 1969 by then-president Rafael Caldera, replacing the Directorate General of Police (DIGEPOL). History =Origin= With the overthrow of General Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez in January 1958, Venezuela was plunged into an acute institutional crisis in the police and security area, following the dismantling of the National Security, also called \\"political police\\"; the absence of a similar, moderately effective organization gives rise to impromptu Technical Services Criminology, an organization in the popular police jargon was known as Criminology, was a time of much confusion as it was beginning to take shape guerrilla activity and for that reason the political activism of opposition was severely punished.

With this decision, the powers of the criminal police, faculty and power of intelligence and state security were separated. However, the DIGEPOL became a repressive police force with intelligence character. =1960s= Creation of DISIP When Rafael Caldera assumed his first presidency in the Venezuela, he ordered the dissolution of the DIGEPOL and signed Decree No. 15, dated March 19, 1969 giving birth to the \\"Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention \\"whose initials are DISIP. Its objective was to demonstrate the initial combat subversion and drug trafficking. Critics however, believed the actually existence of DISIP was to implement state terrorism and may have even included death squads. Its first commanders took the initiative to establish appropriate training courses and their members, mostly from former members of DIGEPOL. In the early years, DISIP recruited Cubans opposed to the government of Fidel Castro and those who had been trained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Political influence The story of the early years of the DISIP parallels the political group \\"Bandera Roja\\", whose leaders Carlos Betancourt (under the pseudonym \\"Geronimo\\"), Eduardo Candiales Barrios and Gabriel Puerta Aponte, Lieutenant Betancourt was confronted by the police organization from the beginning of the group. The DISIP conducted the first dismantling of this group between 1972 and 1973. They also acted against the Party of the Venezuelan Revolution (PRV-FALN) and other smaller groups, achieving frustrate many plans uprising of leftist groups of the time, which had been isolated by the Punto Fijo pact, which had formed the bipartisanship Democratic Action and COPEI. =1970s= In the mid-1970s to the need to raise the technical level of the security agency was created Brigade speeches or Command groups led by the Commissioner General Henry Rafael L√≥pez Sisco, who led major operations against leftist guerrillas in the field, these operations being considered DISIP as violations of human rights. In its early DISIP had nearly 4,000 employees on the payroll between the areas of administration, police and intelligence. =1980s= In this framework, the DISIP holding several clashes such as the Slaughter of Cantaura, occurred between 4 and 8 October 1982 where some tens of DISIP agents with more than 400 soldiers from the Armed Forces kill 23 Front guerrilla fighters \\"Americo Silva\\", belonging to rural guerrilla group Red Flag. =1990s= In the 1990s, the DISIP forward intelligence operations against the rebel soldiers led by Hugo Chavez and Francisco Arias C√°rdenas giving two attempted coup against President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez in 1992, the national government of the time authorized actions to not only pursue and spy on the military rebels but any civilian suspected of supporting the military uprising. In the particular case of November 27, 1992, officers of the Brigade of Interventions, Vehicular Patrol, the General Intelligence and Investigation Division faced by National Guard military rebels, the latter being defeated. DISIP facilities in El Helicoide in Caracas were bombed by the rebel air force. Vargas shootings A murderous rampage against suspected looters in the state of Vargas following the 1999 mudslides became, according to Human Rights Watch, \\"the first major human rights test of the Ch√°vez government. At first, Ch√°vez dismissed the reports as 'suspicious' and 'superficial,' but the evidence soon obliged the president and other top government officials to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation.\\"Human Rights Watch World Report 2001: Venezuela: Human Rights Developments Human Rights Watch expressed their deep concern over DISIP (and National Guard) abuse in Venezuela in a 2004 personal letter to President Hugo Ch√°vez. Amnesty International has also expressed concern over excessive use of force by the DISIP, and the increasing polarization and political violence in Venezuela since Ch√°vez was elected in December 1998.Venezuela: Fear for safety/use of excessive force  Amnesty International International It is in the area of intelligence where it is thought that the body work to infiltrate the social, economic and political sectors.

One of the alleged lesser-known operations was made by the deceased Commissioner General Rafael Rivas-Vasquez who allegedly managed to locate and spy on Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, a Venezuelan militant of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, while living in France. In the eighties, DISIP possibly maintained close ties to the CIA, the MI5 (British Intelligence), the Mossad, Bundes Nachrichten Dienst (German Intelligence Service) to exchange information on Arab revolutionary groups, especially the group of former members of the Red Army Faction or Baader Meinhof group.

It is headquartered in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta. History The history of Jamiat Kheir can be divided into two periods, where during the first period (1905 - 1919) it was as a social organization (and included a school program), and the second period (since 1919) it becomes an education institution only. Starting in 1898, several leaders of Arab community agreed to make an organization that aims to help social condition of the Arabs in Dutch East Indies. The Arab community leaders held meetings to realize their goals to help social life of the Muslim community and Arabs in Indonesia, and to prepare a plan to erect a modern Muslim education institution, as a response against the Dutch Indies education policy. The ideals were also in line with the idea of mufti of Betawi al-Sharif Habib  ªUthman ibn  ªAbdullah ibn Ya·∏•ya, where he encouraged Muslims to build a religious institution to counteract the Christianization through public schools. As a starting, In 1901 several prominent Arab community leaders in Batavia had an initiative to establish an organization that works in the field of social and Islamic education called (\\"The Association of Goodness\\"). The first location where it was founded was at Raudah Mosque on Pekojan Road II, seven years before the Budi Utomo. Near Pekojan Rd. II there is another mosque named Zawiyah Mosque, built by Habib A·∏•mad bin Hamzah Alatas, who was born in Tarim, Hadhramaut. While still teaching at the mosque he used the yellow book Fath Mu'in, which until now still being used as a reference in many places. In front of the mosque there was another mosque called Masjid Nawir which was the largest mosque in West Jakarta. The mosque was built in 1760 and at the front there was a bridge called Jembatan Kambing which had been used by merchants for four generations. The name of the organization was al-Jam'iyyatoul Khairiyyah. A petition was submitted to the government on August 15, 1903, to get official permission for the organization with the goals to provide assistance to the Arabs who were grieving or in loss of family member, and to assist funeral or wedding. The board members were A·∏•mad Basandiet (chairman), Mu·∏•ammad bin  ªAbdullah ShahƒÅb (vice chairman), Mu·∏•ammad al-Fakhir bin  ªAbdurrahman al-Mashhoor (secretary), Idrus bin A·∏•mad ShahƒÅb (as the treasurer) and in the later time involving  ªAli bin A·∏•mad ShahƒÅb (brother of Idrus). Habib  ªAli bin A·∏•mad ShahƒÅb, the co- founder of Jamiat Kheir organization in Batavia during Dutch Indies. The request was not immediately granted by the Dutch government. The submission of the petition probably raised suspicions in the government, where it did not like any establishment of an association that engages in social movements. The Dutch East Indies government then took some actions against the newly founded Jamiat Kheir, of which it limited the areas that could be visited by the Arabs and Arab descendants in Indonesia. In Batavia, the Dutch East Indies government determined the location of their gathering in Pekojan. The \\"Zawiyah\\" Musholla in Pekojan. Cir 1910-1921 The permit took two years to be granted by the government, where it then was issued in 1905, after Mu·∏•ammad bin  ªAbdurrahman al-Mash-hoor as the secretary of Jamiat Kheir sent a letter clarifying the intent and purpose of the establishment of the association on March 16, 1905. On June 17, 1905 Jamiat Kheir as an organization was officially authorized by the Governor General of the Dutch East Indies and its Articles of association were also approved. However, Jamiat Kheir was forbidden to establish branches outside Batavia. Jamiat Kheir was used as a social gathering for all the aspirations of the Alawiyyin, non-Sayyid and Ajami. Langgar Tinggi mosque built by Syekh Said Naum, where the top floor was used as a mosque while the bottom were used as two houses in Pekojan, 1949 The official license issued by the Dutch government was based on the input from Priesterraden, a special body set up in 1882 with the task of overseeing religious and Islamic education. On the advice of this body in 1905, the government passed a law requiring any instructor must first get permission to teach. At that time the government had already feared of possible resurgence among indigenous people. Soon after the permission was obtained, the Jamiat Kheir opened an elementary level (Ibtidaiyyah) madrasa in Pekojan which provided free education, using a curriculum blend of religious studies and general subjects. To show its anti-colonialism, non-religious subjects at the Jamiat Kheir were not taught in Dutch, but in English. The purpose of Jamiat Kheir as contained in the Articles of Association dated August 15, 1903 was to provide assistance to the Arabs, men and women living in and around Batavia, to ease their grief and loss of family member and to give assistance to hold a wedding. The first management of the organization consists of: Said bin A·∏•mad Basandiet (chairman), Mu·∏•ammad bin  ªAbdullah ShahƒÅb (Vice Chairman), Mu·∏•ammad al-Fakhir bin  ªAbdurrahman al-Mashhoor (Secretary), and Idrus bin A·∏•mad ShahƒÅb (Treasurer). After gaining recognition as a legal entity, in accordance with article 10 of the Articles of Association dated August 15, 1903, the first general meeting of members was held on April 9, 1906. In addition to the election of the new management of the Jamiat Kheir consisting of Idrus bin  ªAbdullah al-Mashhoor (as chairman), Salim bin Awad Balweel (vice chairman), Mu·∏•ammad al-Fakhir bin  ªAbdurrahman al-Mashhoor (secretary) and Idrus bin A·∏•mad ShahƒÅb (treasurer), they also amended the Article. The new Articles of Association in the organization had the goals changed. In addition to provide assistance to members of society in the case of death or funeral and marriage problems (chapter 1), the Articles of Association contained a goal to set up schools through the implementation of teaching (chapter 2), and not only for Arabs, but to extend to other ethnicities, as long as he or she is a Muslim (chapter 4). The addition of the Statutes was approved by the government through the governor general's decision on October 24, 1906, because the Jamiat Kheir's Statutes did not contain political purposes and did not contain any incitement (which may endanger the national security of the Dutch Indies government).  ªAbdullah bin  ªAlwi Alatas as the leader of the Pan-Islamic movement gave his support for the establishment of this organization. On 30 September 1907, in accordance with the decision of the general meeting of members, the board held an amendment again, and after the meeting on 27 April 1907 a new board was elected. In this year, Hajj Mu·∏•ammad Mansyur started teaching at the Jamiat Kheir school. He was chosen because of his ability to teach in the Malay language as well as his knowledge of Islamic sciences. Mu·∏•ammad Mansyur was also an advocate of Indonesian Independence of colonialism. He called for the Indonesians to fly the national flag, and for unity with the famous slogan rempuk which means deliberation. He was also one of the most knowledgeable scholars in astronomy at the time. Under the new stewardship consisting of Ab≈´bakar bin  ªAli ShahƒÅb as chairman and Mu·∏•ammad bin  ªAbdurrahman al-Mash-hoor as secretary, the board applied to change the Statute on January 31, 1908. The request was approved by the government on 29 June 1908. Jamiat Kheir advanced quite rapidly and its existence was spread quickly so that many cities and towns asked Jamiat Kheir to build its branch in their areas, but because of the prohibition not to set up branches outside of Batavia, the Jamiat Kheir urged them to set up their own associations. They ended up using the name 'Kheir' (Goodness) in their organization's last name, for example, the Madrasah al-Khairiyah established in Bantam, Banyuwangi and Teluk Betung. In addition, the number of members of the Jamiat Kheir also increased, among them are imams of the mosque, teachers, employees, village headmen or others. In 1908, the Jamiat Kheir began a relationship with Islamic leaders in the Middle East, such as Yusuf  ªAli sharif a publisher of the newspaper al-Muayyad, editor-in-chief Kamil  ªAli for newspaper al-Liwa,  ªAbdul ·∏§amid Zaki as publisher of the newspaper al-Siyasah al-Musyawarah, A·∏•mad Hasan ·π¨abarah a publisher of the newspaper SamarƒÅt al-Funun Beirut, Mu·∏•ammad Said al-Majzub as publisher of the newspaper al-Qistah al-Mustaqim,  ªAbdullah QƒÅsim as editor-in-chief of the newspaper Shamsu al-Haqiqah, and Mu·∏•ammad BƒÅqir Beik as editor-in-chief of the newspaper al- ªAdl. On June 22, 1910, based on the April 1910 members' meeting several months earlier, the board proposed an amendment for a third time. Petition letters filed by Mu·∏•ammad ibn  ªAbdurrahman ShahƒÅb as chairman and son of Shaikh Mu·∏•ammad ibn ShahƒÅb as secretary and the changes were approved on October 3, 1910. The purpose of the Jamiat Kheir increasingly widespread, including: * to establish and maintain school buildings and other buildings in Batavia for the benefit of Muslims, * to improve the knowledge quality of pupils in Islamic sciences. * to push Islamic studies to be taught at other schools * to set up libraries and to collect books to increase knowledge and intelligence The inscription of the establishment of Jamiat Kheir School in Tanah Abang, December 1923 (early 1342 AH) Eventually in 1918 the government decided that the Jamiat Kheir as an organization founded by Asian foreigners was prohibited from engaging in activities of Indonesian citizens. They also emphasized that the Jamiat Kheir's permit could be revoked at any time. Being aware of government suspicion and its suppressions, Jamiat Kheir then took a strategy to change its Article of association again, especially in matters of education. Because Jamiat Kheir as a social organization had been suspected by the government due to its political activities, then on October 17, 1919 it amended its Article of association and became an education foundation. On the date, Jamiat Kheir became the Education Foundation of Jamiat Kheir based on the new dated October 17, 1919 which was recorded in the notary deed number 143, STICHTINGSBRIEF de STICHTING \\"SCHOOL DJAMEAT GEIR\\" (The Deed of Djameat Geir School), by Jan Willem Roeloffs Valk in Batavia. The composition of the school board were Said Aboebakar bin Alie bin Shahab as The Chairman of the board, Said Abdulla bin Hoesin Alaijdroes, Said Aloei bin Abdulrachman Alhabsi, Said Aboebakar bin Mohamad Alhabsi, Said Aboebakar bin Abdullah Alatas, Said Aijdroes bin Achmad bin Shahab and Sech Achmad bin Abdulla Basalama were the members of the board (the names are spelled as they were in the deeds). Two of the members were also the founders of Jamiat Kheir organization (the first period). Since then all activities of Jamiat Kheir conducted through its Education Foundation. The school name is also slightly different from the original name of the organization (al-Jam'iyyatoul Khairiyyah). On December 27, 1928 the Dutch Indies government granted first permission to found al-Rabi·π≠ah al- ªAlawiyah with the second permission issued on 27 November 1929, where many of the management members were also members of Jamiat Kheir. On August 12, 1931 at Karet St. no. 47, the DƒÅrul Aytam (literally means House of orphans) orphanage was established by notarial deed of Dirk Johannes Michiel de Hondt (1886-1945) No. 40, with its first chief Sayyid Ab≈´bakar bin Mu·∏•ammad bin  ªAbdurrahman Al Habshƒ´. It is located in Tanah Abang. =Prominent members= * Haji Omar Said Tjokroaminoto * Ahmad Dahlan * Ahmad Jayadiningrat Activity =Economy= On January 26, 1913 members of the Jamiat Kheir founded the printing company NV Handel-Maatschappij Setija Oesaha. The limited liability business Setija Oesaha was established and headquartered in Pabean sub-district, Pesayangan in Surabaya and the operation was entrusted to HOS Tjokroaminoto who served as the director. On March 31, 1913 the company published the newspaper Oetoesan Hindia, with Tjokroaminoto as its editor-in-chief. =Social= The founders and staff of Jamiat Kheir in front of the new building in Tanah Abang, 1923. The activities of the Jamiat Kheir in the beginning were more directed towards social problems of community, concerning with the problems of poverty, illiteracy and ignorance suffered by Muslims as results of colonization. Initially, giving assistance to grieving family whose loss its family member, to help the funeral, to help orphans and aging elderly were major activities and programs of Jamiat Kheir. Later time, it built the orphanage DƒÅrul Aytam which is dedicated to treating and educating orphans in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta, which until now is still active. The Jamiat Kheir also had an international reputation through the relationship with the Muslims in the middle east. On the basis of Islamic brotherhood, Jamiat Kheir helped financially to victims of the war in Tripoli, and built the Hejaz Railway connecting the city of Medina with the areas around the strip of Sham and others. =Politics= In politics, the Jamiat Kheir was involved in Sarekat Islam organization activities. Political activities of the Jamiat Kheir could be seen in its relationship with other Islamic states. This relationship also showed the attitude of Indonesians toward Dutch Indies government in general and showed the attitude of Jamiat Kheir in particular, which was not in line with the Dutch government. Since 1902, Jamiat Kheir had published articles in some Egyptian newspapers which were submitted by Hasan bin  ªAbdullah bin  ªAlwi ShahƒÅb. Another staff of Jamiat Kheir who was a correspondent for the newspaper al-Muayyad and ThamarƒÅt al-Funnun,  ªAli bin A·∏•mad bin Mu·∏•ammad ShahƒÅb, since 1912 began sending his writings and published on various newspapers and magazines in Egypt and Turkey. These writings were essentially about issues around Dutch colonialism in Indonesia or British ruling in Malaysia. They revealed the evils of government rules that suppressed the people of the countries. Besides the two men, since 1908 Jamiat Kheir members also wrote about Islamic movements in Indonesia, about what they perceived as the Dutch East Indies government repression against the Muslim population of Indonesia. These writings were published on newspapers and magazines in Istanbul, Syria and Egypt, including the al-ManƒÅr magazine. Since the Jamiat Kheir's publications were distributed widespread, news about intimidations carried out by the Dutch government heard internationally and got enough attention. One of them was from Ottoman empire in Turkey which sent two envoys to Batavia,  ªAbdul  ªAziz al-Musawi and Galib Beik. The purpose of their visit stated to investigate the situation of Muslims in Indonesia. This investigation effort could be, to some extent, was influenced by the news sent by Jamiat Kheir members to Ottoman empire. However, both consuls received pressure and intimidation from the Dutch Government. The pressure and intimidation from the Dutch East Indies to the Jamiat Kheir instead created stronger ties of brotherhood between Arabs and indigenous Indonesian society. This made the Dutch East Indies government became increasingly fearful and anxious, especially when the Jamiat Kheir became a liaison between the Indonesian people and the Ottoman government which was very sympathetic to the struggle for independence in Indonesia. To complement the nationalism of Jamiat Kheir, the Regent of Serang whose also a member of the organization Jamiat Kheir, A·∏•mad Djajadiningrat, built a competing organization that was also based in Batavia. The organization must be led by Indonesian noblemen to imitate the Jamiat Kheir whose many of the indigenous students were aristocratic Javanese, such as Ahmad Dahlan who later became the founder of Muhammadiyah. This was in line with Agus Salim's prediction stating that many members of the Budi Utomo would be former members of the Jamiat Kheir. The name of the new organization, according to A·∏•mad Djajadiningrat, should be similar to 'Jamiat Kheir', so they named it Budi Utomo. This name is the translated word of the Arabic Jamiat Kheir to Javanese, where the meaning of both words is very similar (benevolent society). Robert Van Niel in his book The Emergence of the Modern Indonesian Elite wrote that many members of the Sarekat Islam were former members of the Jamiat Kheir. Although, as stated in the Budi Utomo's resolution in 1911, a decision was made to no longer accept non-native Indonesians as members, many Arabs remained members of or actively collaborated with Sarekat Islam. In Batavia, the overwhelming number of registrations from people to become members of Sarekat Islam made the Sarekat Islam in March 1913 decided to stop admitting new members. The intention was to avoid the administration become chaotic and out of control. =Education= The first board of Jamiat Kheir as an education foundation initially consists of (all names spelled as they are originally written in the Van Ophuijsen spelling, e.g., Said instead of Sayyid or Syed, Aboebakar instead of Abubakar, Moehamad instead of Muhammad): *Said Aboebakar bin Mohammad bin Abdulrachman Alhabsi (the Chairman) *Said Aboebakar bin Abdullah bin Achmad Alatas (First Vice Chairman) *Said Idroes bin Ahmad bin Mohamad Sjahab (Second Vice Chairman) *Said Hoesain bin Ahmad bin Hoesin bin Semit (First Secretary) *Said Moehamad bin Ahmad bin Hoesin bin Semit (Second Secretary) *Said Salim bin Tahir bin Saleh Alhabsi (First Treasurer) *Said Abdulqadir bin Hasan bin Abdulrachman Molagela (Second Treasurer) The commissioners: *Said Ali bin Abdulrachman bin Abdullah Alhabsi *Said Alwi bin Tahir Alhadad *Said Alwi bin Mochamad bin Tahir Alhadad *Said Ahmad bin Abdullah bin Mochsin Assegaf *Said Jahja bin Oesman bin Jahja *Said Abdullah bin Aboebakar bin Salim Alhabsi *Said Hasjim bin Mohamad bin Hasjim Alhabsi *Said Hasan bin Sech Assolabiah Alaidroes *Said Abdoellah bin Moehamad Alhadad *Said Aloei bin Abdullah bin Hoesin Alaijdroes *Said Tahir bin Hoesin bin Semit *Sjech Salim bin Achmad bin Djoenet Bawazir *Said Abdulrachman bin Abdilla bin Abdulrachman Alhabsi *Said Ali bin Aloei bin Abdulrachman Alhabsi *Said Abdullah bin Mohamad bin Achmad bin Hasan Alatas Photo of Tanah Abang in 1870, where the Jamiat Kheir later in 1923 moved from Pekojan to this area. Habib Ab≈´bakar bin  ªAli ShahƒÅb, the first principal of Jamiat Kheir The first headmaster of the Jamiat Kheir school was Habib Ab≈´bakar bin  ªAli ShahƒÅb who was also one of the founders of The Jamiat Kheir Education Foundation. He was also the writer of his autobiography, ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿµŸÅÿ± (RIHLATUL ASHFAR). He was born in Batavia on October 24, 1870 CE (or 28 Rajab 1287 AH) and died in Batavia on March 18, 1944 (23 Rabi' al-thani 1363 AH) and was buried in the Tanah Abang cemetery, Jakarta. His father is  ªAli bin Ab≈´bakar bin  ªUmar bin  ªAli bin  ªAbdullah bin ShahƒÅb born in Dammun, a small village near Tarim, Hadhramaut. His mother is Muznah binti Said Naum, the daughter of the land endowment () foundation founder Shaikh Said Na'um. The school board of Jamiat Kheir, having noticed that the facility in Pekojan could no longer able to accommodate the flow of prospective students which increased every year, excited to find a new larger location. Initially they planned to move Jamiat Kheir from Pekojan to a new location on Karet Weg street in Tanah Abang, but because the venue was planned for a hospital by the Dutch government (now it is occupied as the Puskesmas of Tanah Abang), with the initiative of Ab≈´bakar bin Mu·∏•ammad al-Habshi (the Chairman of the board) in 1923, the Foundation bought a new land for the school. The building has been used as the center of operations until now. With the initiative of A·∏•mad bin  ªAbdullah al-Saggaf in 1924, a building for boarding students often called Internaat was built. The purpose of the Internaat was to protect, to educate and to familiarize the students with good Islamic traditions. The cost was determined 30 guilders a month. At internaat, they were directed and guided in order to fill their time with any good activities for the soul and body. The Jamiat Kheir's Internaat was opened on May 15, 1924 by occupying two houses on the Jalan Karet number 72. On March 26, 1929, the foundation made another attempt to buy a plot of land in Kebun Melati which later used as girls-only Elementary School. Because there was the law forbidding Jamiat Kheir to open school branches in other cities with the same name, people then established schools with different names (although sametimes similar, especially in Arabic) but with the same spirit and most of them affiliated with the Jamiat Kheir in Batavia, such as al-Jam ªiyyah al- Khairƒ´yah al- ªArabiyah in Ampel, al-Mu‚Äôawanah in Cianjur, al- ªArabiyah al- Islamiyah in Banyuwangi, and Shama'il Huda in Pekalongan. The Shama'il Huda school in Pekalongan was led by Mu·∏•ammad al- ªIdroos. Like Jamiat Kheir, this school also hired teachers from the Middle East such as Shaikh Ibrahƒ´m of Egypt. A year later the management changed, where  ªAbdullah al-A·π≠·π≠as was appointed as the Principal, Mu·∏•ammad Salim al-A·π≠·π≠as as the vice Principal, Hasan  ªAli al-A·π≠·π≠as as Secretary, and Na·π£r  ªAbdullah Bakri as Treasurer. The member of counsel consisted of Hasan  ªAlwi ShahƒÅb,  ªIdroos Mu·∏•ammad al-Jufri, Saqqaf Ja ªfar al-Saqqaf, Mu·∏•ammad  ªUmar Abdat, Cik Saleh Isma ªil,  ªAbdulqadir Hasan, SƒÅlim  ªUbaidah and Zen Mu·∏•ammad Bin Ya·∏•ya. The schools were not exclusive to Arab Indonesians only, but also many of the pupils were of indigenous Indonesians. Due to lack of qualified teachers to teach at the Jamiat Kheir schools, the board decided to hire teachers from overseas. In around October 1911, a Sudanese scholar name Ahmad Surkati arrived in Batavia along with two other teachers, Mu·∏•ammad bin  ªAbdul ·∏§amid (a Sudanese living in Mecca) and Mu·∏•ammad al-·π≠ayyib, a Moroccan who soon returned to his homeland. They had been preceded by another teacher, the Tunisian Mu·∏•ammad bin  ªUthman al-Hashimi who had come to the Indies in 1910. Soon after they arrived in Batavia, Jamiat Kheir opened two branch schools, one was located in Bogor and directed by Mu·∏•ammad 'Abd al-·∏§amid, and the other was at Pekojan (in Batavia), directed by Mu·∏•ammad al-Tayyib. Surkati was appointed as the inspector for both the Jamiat Kheir schools but based in Batavia. Surkati's first two years at this position was a great success, creating an assurance for the Jamiat Kheir to hire four more foreign teachers in October 1913. It was on his recommendation that Jamiat Kheir invited other teachers from abroad. In 1912 one of his own brothers, joined by three other teachers, came to Batavia. They included Abu al-Fadl Mu·∏•ammad al-SƒÅti al-Surkati (Surkati's brother), Shaykh Mu·∏•ammad Nur bin Mu·∏•ammad Khayr al-An·π£ari, Shaikh Muhamnmad al-'Aqib and Shaikh Hasan ·∏§amid al-An·π£ari. All of them were from Sudan. They all joined A·∏•mad Surkati in Batavia except Shaikh Mu·∏•ammad al-'Aqib who launched a new Jamiat school branch in Surabaya. Conflict Some of more conservative Sayyid members of the Jamiat Kheir were becoming increasingly concerned about Surkati's influence on the Hadhrami community, and particular his attitudes towards the Sayyids themselves. It became more serious in 1913 when Surkati was asked during his visit to Solo during school holidays about his opinion on a marriage between a Sayyid woman with a non-Sayyid man. The case concerned a woman, a daughter of a Sayyid, who was living as concubine with a Chinese. Surkati suggested that money should be collected from among the local Ha·∏çramis in order to release her from such a shameful circumstance which was apparently driven by economic hardship. When the proposal was ignored, he then suggested that one of the local Muslims should marry her. When the objection was put that her marriage to a non-Sayyid would be illegal on the basis of Kafa'ah, he argued it would be legal according to a reformist interpretation of Islamic law. His opinion was quickly heard by the Jamiat Kheir leaders in Batavia, causing his relationship with the more conservative Sayyids deteriorated rapidly. Sukarti also experienced racist criticism against him over this conflict.Anthropologica, Part 157 2001, p. 413. The name \\"'Alawi-Irshadi conflict\\" became applied to the split between the Sayyid faction (known as 'Alawis, Alawƒ´y≈´n) and the non-Sayyids (al-IrshƒÅd led by Surkati). The 'Alawi Sayyid Muhammad bin 'AbdullƒÅh al-'A·π≠·π≠ƒÅs even said \\"The al-Irshad organization, in my view, is no pure Arab organization. There is too much African blood among its members for that\\".Mobini-Kesheh 1999, p. 91. 'AbdullƒÅh Da·∏•lƒÅn attacked Surkati's stance that all humans whether Sayyid or non-Sayyid were equal by arguing that God creating some humans like the Prophet's family (the Sayyids) as superior to others. He said, \\"will the Negro return from his error or persist in his stubbornness?\\"Mobini-Kesheh 1999, p. 96. Some Hadrami Sayyids including Da·∏•lƒÅn resorted to extreme racist results and insulted Sukarti, calling him \\"the black death\\", \\"black slave\\", \\"the black\\", \\"the Sudanese\\" and \\"the Negro\\", all while claiming that Sukarti could not speak Arabic and was a non-Arab.Mobini-Kesheh 1999, p. 98. A·∏•mad Surkati was silent and could not reply with any arguments when his opinion was contested by  ªAbdullah bin Mu·∏•ammad Sadaqah Dahlan, who later replaced his position, with the same strong arguments based on al-Quran and sound sunnah. A rebuttal was even written by  ªAbdullah al-Aqib, one of Surkati's student, with the title of al-Khitab Fa·π£l fi Ta ªyid al-S≈´rah. In addition to Dahlan's writing, there are other writings that discuss kafa'ah among Alawi, one of them is al-BurhƒÅn al- Nuroni fi Dah·∏ç MuftaroyƒÅt al-Sinari al-Sudani by Habib  ªAlwi bin Husein Mudaihij. Further arguments written by Surkati and supporters eroded out by the book published in 1926 entitled al-Qaul al-Fa·π£l fƒ´ mƒÅ li Bani HƒÅshim wa Quraish wa al-Arab min al-Fa·∏çl written by Mufti of Johor  ªAlwi bin »öahir al- Haddad. Surkati then wrote his arguments and answers in Al-Masa \`il ats- Tsalats in 1925 which contained the issue of Ijtihad, Bid‚Äòah, Sunnah, Heresy, Ziyarat (visiting graves), Taqbil (kissing the hands of Sayyids) and Tawassul. This essay paper actually was prepared as the material for a debate with Ali al-Thayyib of the Ba'alawi. The debate itself was initially planned to be held in Bandung. But Ali al-Thayyib cancelled it and asked the debate to be held in Masjid Ampel in Surabaya. But eventually he cancelled it again so there was no debate at all. Surkati tendered his resignation on September 18, 1914. Many non-Sayyids and some Sayyids left the Jamiat Kheir with him. He initially intended to return to Mecca where he used to teach, but was persuaded to stay by a non-Sayyid Hadhrami named  ªUmar Manqush (or Mangus with another transliteration), the Kapitein der Arabieren in Batavia, so he opened another Islamic school named al-IrshƒÅd in Batavia with the financial assistance of some Arabs, the largest of which from  ªAbdullah bin  ªAlwi Ala·π≠·π≠as, a wealthy landlord living in Petamburan, Batavia, who donated 60,000 Dutch gulden. The Surkati's quit from the Jamiat Kheir was not really caused by religious differences, but was more influenced by conspiracy of the Dutch Indies colonial government that has been arranged by  ªUmar Mangush and Rinkes, The Dutch adviser for Arab and indigenous communities. The relationship of these three had been previously established to create conflict among the Muslim community and for personal interests. Since early days, the Alawiyyin had advised Surkati through the Jamiat Kheir to not be associated with  ªUmar Mangush and Rinkes, but Surkati refused their request. The close relationship between Surkati,  ªUmar Mangush and the Dutch colonial government, making the Dutch authorities always intervened to help the difficulties between them and al-IrshƒÅd. Present time Jamiat Kheir today In subsequent years Jamiat Kheir concentrates its activities only in education, while the al-Rabi·π≠ah al-'Alawiyah continues the original purpose and activities of Jamiat Kheir (non-education related social activities). Some founders of the al-Rabi·π≠ah who were also administrators of Jamiat Kheir, among others were Mu·∏•ammad bin  ªAbdurrahman bin A·∏•mad Idrus ShahƒÅb, Idrus bin A·∏•mad ShahƒÅb,  ªAli bin A·∏•mad ShahƒÅb, Shaikhan bin A·∏•mad ShahƒÅb, Ab≈´bakar bin  ªAbdullah al-A·π≠·π≠as and Ab≈´bakar bin Mu·∏•ammad al-habshƒ´. The first student financed by the al-Rabi·π≠ah to graduate from Jamiat Kheir was Sharifah Qamar of Darul Aytam, where she received stipend of 15 guilders a month. Currently the schools are run under Yayasan Pendidikan Jamiat Kheir (The Education Foundation of Jamiat Kheir). The Foundation has elementary, middle and high schools as well as an undergraduate college which are all located in Tanah Abang, where for the elementary and middle schools, they are Single-sex schools. In 2005 The Foundation built another elementary school with different name, Binakheir, in Depok.

After he rid the earth of all the Kshatriyas twenty-one times, Parshurama donated the entire earth to Maharshi Kashyap, thus he could not reside on that land. Parashuram had twenty-one battles to rid of those Kshatriyas Kings who had become brutal dictators and had given up principles of dharma. The Last Ruler to be killed was Kartavirya Arjuna. Rulers like Janak or Ikshwaku who ruled by principles were not harmed. Parshurama shot an arrow in the Arabian sea, pushed the sea back and reclaimed the land of Konkan, today‚Äôs 720 km coastline of India stretching from Mumbai to Kerala. Parshurama chose the Mahendragiri peak (in the village also named Parshuram) from this land for his permanent residence. This is the place where the temple is located. It is believed that Lord Parshurama leaves for the Himalayas at sunrise, does tapa in the Himalayas and returns to the temple at sunset.  Temple History  The temple was built by initiative from Swami Paramhans Brahmendra. He was the Guru of Siddi Yakutkhan of Janjira, Kanhoji Angre of Kolaba, Peshwa of Pune, Chatrapati Sahu Maharaj, Tararani of Kolhapur. He was also admired by the Portuguese and English for his presence in Peshwa and Angre's courts. Siddi Rasul Yakut Khan gave financial help to build Parshuram Temple in 1700. He gave Pedhe and Ambdas villages as Inam (prize) to Swamiji to incur daily expenses of the temple. Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj gave 5 nearby villages as Inam (prize). He built three temples, a Deepmahal (a tall stone structure used to light oil lamps as an offering to God) and a lodge for the pilgrims at Parshuram. Kanhoji Angre gave Mahalunge, Dorle, Kalambuse, Nayari, Virmade, Anewadi and Dhawdashi Inam (prize). In 1726 Siddhi demolished the temples by blaming Swamiji for giving away their elephant to Kanoji Angre, which was not true. The elephant, on its way from Savanur to Gowalkot was taken away by Angre's men to Jaigad. The Swami became angry and returned the elephant to Siddhi Saat. He later realized his mistake and rebuilt the demolished temples.

The Act is not a general employment law, because it applies only to certain occupational groups--those defined under Danish law as salaried. The core group consists of employees engaged in clerical work, trade (for example, shop assistants), inventory processing, technical or clinical work (for example, engineers, nurses and doctors), management, etc. However, executives who are not subject to supervision, for example, CEOs, are not covered by the law. In principle, the Act is not applicable to employees engaged in craft or factory work, agriculture, fishery, waiting tables, kitchen work, etc. However, although many sectors of employment are not immediately subject to the law, the law nonetheless applies to a portion of such sectors through employment contracts or agreements which provide that the law is to apply (for example, auxiliary nurses, educators, social and health care assistants, and Folkeskole teachers). In Denmark, these are sometimes referred to as aftalefunktion√¶rer (contract salaried employees) as opposed to lovfunktion√¶rer (legal salaried employees), to whom the law automatically applies. Finally, some occupational groups in principle covered by the Act, by virtue of agreements derogating from the law have a legal status which is better or worse than is provided for under the Act. There is a requirement for the law to be applicable that the employee works at least 8 hours a week on average, and also a requirement that the employee is not a civil servant. The regulations concerning termination of employment under the Act establish a system of notices of termination based on the employee's length of service, which cannot be derogated from to the detriment of the employee. There is also the possibility of compensation in certain cases. The regulations concerning non-solicitation and non-competition clauses under the Act entitle the employee to compensation amounting to half pay during the period after leaving the job during which the employee is covered by such clauses.

It was released on January 4, 2013, and was optioned by Hulu for exclusive VOD distribution starting June 5, 2014. Crawlspace focuses on a family that is terrorized by the former occupant of their new home. Synopsis Tim (Jonathan Silverman) and Susan (Lori Loughlin) Gates are eager to move into their new house with their teenage son Shane (Sterling Beaumon) and their younger son Taylor (Xander Stolberg), as well as their college-bound daughter Kayla (Raleigh Holmes), despite the house's dark history of drowned children and foreclosure. As they settle into the house, strange things frequently occur, like the garbage cans being taken out for collection without explanation. While Kayla and her boyfriend Derek (Paul James) are sorting out items for a garage sale, the garage door inexplicably opens and closes. The next day, the ladder from the crawlspace descends into view, and the house's previous owner Aldon Webber (Steven Weber) climbs down. He washes up and helps himself to some food, and he retrieves a stuffed unicorn that Kayla had thrown out. Webber's intrusions into the Gates' lives grow more elaborate and sinister as the film progresses. He watches them closely through the air vents, and he even creeps into Kayla's room one night to film her sleeping. The Gates' elderly neighbor warns Kayla and Shane that they need to get out of the house. She has witnessed Webber moving around when the family is gone during the day. After her warning, Webber sneaks into the neighbor's house and attacks her. He stuffs her vacuum cleaner's hose extension into her mouth and then reverses the air flow, emptying the vacuum's contents down her throat. Webber's next victim is Taylor's babysitter, who was not watching as the boy played with Shane's paintball gun. At the garage sale, Webber reveals himself to Kayla and Shane, but poses as a customer. When Webber does not leave after the sale is over, Shane approaches him aggressively. Webber punches Shane in the face and walks off the property. The next day, he is fixing the garbage disposal under the sink when his ex-wife comes to the house for a visit. She is under the impression that Webber is living in their old home until the phone rings and the answering machine plays the Gates' message. Webber attacks his ex-wife and shoves her head into the exposed blades of the garbage disposal. He wraps her body in plastic wrap and stores it in the crawlspace with his other victims. The family calls an exterminator because they have begun to notice the decomposition odor. Chuck the Exterminator (David Koechner) investigates the crawlspace and discovers Webber's sleeping area, which he has plastered with pictures of the Gates as well as his own family. Chuck then discovers the bodies of Webber's victims. Webber attacks Chuck and strangles him with some Christmas lights. Fed up with all the suspicious activity at the house, Kayla installs a webcam, which she is monitoring at a coffee shop when she sees Webber disable it. Recognizing him as the man who attacked Shane at the garage sale, she calls the police, who identify the man as the former owner of the house. Tim confesses that not only did his bank foreclose on the Webber's house after their children died, but that he did not help the Webber's keep the house because he wanted it for his own family. The Gates prepare for a long night in the house, with everyone taking some measure of precaution. Tim holds on to a pistol, while Shane keeps watch with his paintball gun. The next morning, Webber begins his final assault on the Gates. His first target is Derek, who he kills by ramming Susan's curling iron through his mouth. He puts Ambien in Shane's Mountain Dew, and he knocks Susan out with the ladder from the crawlspace. Tim confronts Webber with his pistol, but Webber has removed the bullets. He knocks Tim out and turns his attention to Kayla, who is in the crawlspace looking for Taylor. Webber has locked Taylor in a storage chest. Kayla manages to free him before Webber catches up to her. She tackles Webber, and the two of them fall through the floor. When they come to, their struggle climaxes in the kitchen. Susan has also regained consciousness and shoots Webber with Shane's paintball gun. Webber responds by throwing a kitchen knife into Susan's chest. The paintball canister rolls over to Kayla, who puts it onto one of the gas burners on the stove. Susan manages to shoot Webber three times and then the canister explodes, sending a burning Webber flying through the air. The film ends as a family moves into the elderly neighbor's house. The mother is on the phone telling a friend that the house was a steal because of some domestic tragedy next door. She explains that the owner went psycho and disappeared. Unknown to her, Webber, who is still alive, is hiding in her attic, watching her talk on the phone. The film ends as he turns to the camera to reveal the burns that he suffered during the explosion.

Policy on gendered pronouns The preschool has received attention for its refusal to use the terms \\"him\\" and \\"her\\" and encouraging the children to say \\"friend\\" or to use the gender-neutral pronoun hen instead. The idea of the gender-neutral pronoun came from Finnish (about 5% of the population of Sweden is Finnish-speakers). Since Finnish completely lacks grammatical gender, has no way (and no need) to express gender with pronouns. In Swedish, han means he and hon means she ‚Äì but the Finns ab ovo use the gender-neutral personal pronoun h√§n, which means both he or she. The school has avoided books that have gender-specific roles and definitions.

In the process of setting up the extragalactic distance scale, the greatest difficulty leading to the currently largest contribution on the systematic uncertainty of the Hubble constant lies in the determination of accurate absolute distances to nearby galaxies. The principal reason for this persisting difficulty is in the unknown dependencies of stellar standard candles, used to measure the distances of nearby galaxies, on the environmental properties of their host galaxies (metallicity, age of the stellar populations etc.).

The congress is the highest organ of the party, and is stipulated to be held every four years. 916 delegates represented the party's 1,164,945 members. The 3rd Central Committee, elected by the congress, reelected Kim Il-sung as WPK Chairman, and a number of deputy chairmen. Background The 17th Plenary Session of the 2nd Central Committee decided on 3 December 1955 that the 3rd Congress would be held in April 1956, two months after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), in which de-Stalinization became the Soviet Union's official policy. Choe Yong-gon, a partisan close to Kim Il-sung, attended the 20th Congress and reported on its activities personally to Kim Il-sung when he returned. After being told of the new Soviet policy, Kim Il-sung reacted swiftly; in his first speech after the CPSU congress he told WPK members that they needed to curtail the powers of a single leader by establishing a collective leadership. Kim Il- sung went on to chastise former figures such as Pak Hon-yong and Yi Sung-yop who, he claimed, had exerted \\"individual heroism\\" and failed to follow collective leadership procedures. However, this was just talk, and no one related the discussion about collective leadership to Kim Il-sung's power concentration at the top; he held the highest party office, the WPK chairmanship, and the highest state office, as head of government. In a similar vein, Kim Il-sung did not refer to the Soviet Union's de-Stalinization policies by name and did not criticize Joseph Stalin's leadership; however, he had no problem criticizing the activities of people close to Stalin; Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Georgy Malenkov and Nikolai Bulganin for instance. Congress Delegates from fraternal parties attended the congress, most notably CPSU Politburo member Leonid Brezhnev and Marshal Nie Rongzhen leading the delegation from the Communist Party of China. In his speech to the congress, Brezhnev congratulated the WPK on holding its 3rd Congress while telling them the new policies decided upon by the CPSU at the 20th Congress. He emphasized the importance of implementing the Leninist system of collective leadership within the party, from top to bottom, to strengthen the party. Nie Rongzhen on the other hand, congratulated the combine effort of the WPK and the Korean people in the reconstruction of the country in the aftermath of the Korean War. Kim delivered a lengthy speech, but arguably one of the worst in his career according to Suh Dae-sook. In it, he condemned the former leaders of the domestic faction, talked at length about the economic situation, the North Korean position in international affairs and promoting the efforts of the partisans during the Japanese occupation of Korea, but he never mentioned the two most pressing subjects of the time; that of collective leadership and de-Stalinization. He claimed that the domestic faction were to blame for the failure of the Korean War, while in tandem reiterated that Koreans should read more history while continuing to claim that the partisan activities were the basis of North Korean culture and ideology. However, he went on to note that Korean nationalists such as Kim Kyu-sik and Kim Gu were patriots (he had condemned them at the 1st Congress). Yi Chong-won, one of the country's leading historians, spoke in favour of Kim Il-sung's suggestions after his speech, and claimed inaccurately that the partisans and Kim Il-sung had played the dominant role in liberating Korea from Japan. To elaborate his position even further, the Procurator General Yi Song-un told the delegates that there still existed people, who belonged to the domestic faction, who had not undergone proper self-criticism or still supported the overthrow of the existing party leadership. Changes were made to the party's by-laws, with Pak Chong-ae presenting the changes to the congress. She told the delegates that the changes were made under influence from the 20th Congress of the CPSU. These amendments (as they were presented), were practically new by-laws. Three reasons for the amendments were given to the delegates; to facilitate the construction \\"of new socialism\\", to contribute and strengthen the party organization and change in accordance with other fraternal parties. The majority of her presentation dealt with how the new amendments would protect ordinary party members from high-standing officials; she pointed out by name the errors committed by Kim Yol and Pak Song-sam who she alleged had harassed party members. These new members were designed to protect ordinary members, however \\"there was little in the bylaws to substantiate such protection.\\" In any case, by this point the party's by-laws were symbolic more than anything else, and Kim Il-sung and his partisan colleagues did not adhere to them. According to Kim Il-sung the party had grown considerably since the 2nd Congress, having by the 3rd Congress 1,164,945 members in 58,529 cells. The party had grown despite of the Korean War (with the majority of the growth occurring after the war), with an increase from the 2nd Congress by 439,183 members and 28,496 cells. The entire WPK membership represented 10 percent of the entire North Korean population. The confusion which stemmed from the decisions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU were felt in the election of the 3rd Central Committee. Several Soviet Koreans still held high-standing party offices, including their informal leader Pak Chang-ok (who had been criticized by name on several occasions by Kim Il-sung), while prominent members of the Yanan faction \\"whose revolutionary activities had been ridiculed by Kim in the past were reelected\\". The same can be said of the domestic communists, several of them who were reelected were close to Pak Hon-yong (who had tried to overthrow Kim Il-sung the previous year), such as Ho Song-taek and Puk Mun- gyu. Despite this, Kim Il-sung managed to get many of his closest reelected to the Central Committee; 11 full members and 6 candidate members were partisans, but more importantly, of the six highest ranked Central Committee members, four of them were partisans (Kim Il-sung, Choe Yong-gun, Kim Il and Pak Kum- chol, the other two were Kim Tu-bong and Pak Chong-ae). Only 28 members were reelected to the 3rd Central Committee, 43 were new members and only five were promoted from candidate membership to full membership. 46 candidate members were elected to the 3rd Central Committee, of these two were reelected. None of the members of the 2nd Central Inspection Commission were reelected to the 3rd Central Inspection Commission. 1st plenum of the 3rd Central Committee Central Committee ranking list:Sung Chul Yang.

In 2013, he directed a short documentary film Coal Curse which highlighted the wrongs in the Indian coal mining industry. The 45-minute film, supported by Greenpeace, delved into the political economy of coal in contemporary India with the Singrauli example serving as a case study. This was Guha Thakurta's second film on coal, the earlier one being 'Hot as hell: Why Jharia is burning', that was produced in 2006 by the Public Service Broadcasting Trust. His 2014 book Gas Wars: Crony Capitalism and the Ambanis, co-authored with Subir Ghosh and Jyotirmoy Chaudhuri, dealt with alleged irregularities of the prices of natural gas in the Indian market. Reliance Industries Limited, one of India's major conglomerates which is also involved in oil and gas exploration and production, sent a legal notice to Guha Thakurta and others for defamation through this book. Amnesty International event in New Delhi.alt= In 2016, he joined EPW (Economic and Political Weekly) as Editor. Following his article on how Adani Group was benefited by the government policies, a defamation notice was sent to the Sameeksha Trust and the authors of the article. Soon after that, Guha Thakurta resigned as the Editor of EPW. The article brought to light how the Government tweaked the rules which favoured a certain company within the Adani Group to the tune of Rs 500 Crores. EPW tried to reach out to Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but no explanation was given for this policy decision. The Adani Group is headed by Gautam Adani who is understood to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. = Paid news = Guha Thakurta was a member of the sub-committee set up by the Press Council of India to look into the malaise of paid news. Initially, the report titled '‚ÄòPaid News: How Corruption in the Indian Media Undermines Democracy\\" was to be released on 26 April 2010, but it was deferred after many members of the Council raised objections. A diluted version of the report, which was released on 30 July 2010, raised a storm. A number of newspaper establishments were named as having indulged in editorial malpractices. These included Bennett, Coleman and Co (owners of The Times of India), HT Media (owners of Hindustan Times, Hindustan and Mint), Dainik Jagaran, Dainik Bhaskar, Punjab Kesari, Lokmat, Eenadu, and Sakshi group, among others. In September 2010, the Central Information Commission (CIC) of India directed the Council to make public the report as part of suo motu disclosure mandated under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. Guha Thakurta has since written extensively on the issue of \\"paid news\\". In a December 2013 article for First Post, he explained why the malaise of \\"paid news\\" is a threat to democracy: = PIL on 2G case = Guha Thakurta was one of many well-known people who joined a public interest litigation in the 2G spectrum case, originally filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. He has written extensively on the scam, with the first article on the subject appearing in The Economic Times in November 2007.

Augustin, Gl√ºckstadt / New York, 1964, p. 70. His datation is extremely uncertain since he was tentatively placed in both the First and the Second Intermediate Period. Dynastic collocation After the finding of the lintel, Petrie believed the royal name to be Uaqerre but was doubtful about his datation, and simply placed him between the Seventh and the Fourteenth Dynasties. Shortly after, Gaston Maspero attributed the mysterious king to the Sixth to the Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt range. Max Pieper more correctly read the name Khuiqer, claiming that this king should have reigned between the Thirteenth and the 18th Dynasties. Ludwig Borchardt came to the same conclusion, while in 1907 Henri Gauthier, following instead Maspero, placed him again in the First Intermediate Period. When, more recently, the German Egyptologist Detlef Franke proposed the existence of the Abydos DynastyDetlef Franke, Zur Chronologie des Mittleren Reiches. Teil II: Die sogenannte Zweite Zwischenzeit Alt√§gyptens, In Orientalia, 57 (1988), p. 259. (a dynasty of local pharaohs who might have shortly ruled upon the Abydene territory during the Second Intermediate Period), he placed Khuiqer inside of it. J√ºrgen von Beckerath attributed him to the Second Intermediate Period too, following the claim that the block came from a building of Senusret I, although he admitted that Khuiqer's Horus name, Merut, seemed peculiar for this period. This Horus name was also the main topic for Kim Ryholt's attribution: he argued that Merut is too simple when compared to the Horus names of the Second Intermediate Period, which usually are composed or two or even three different words. Ryholt then suggested an earlier placement for Khuiqer, at an imprecise time during the First Intermediate Period.Kim Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c. 1800-1550 B.C.

History 1st issue of Freundschaftsbanner from January, 1st, 1932 was first published on January 1, 1932, under the original title (Friendship Banner) as a joint project of Laura Thoma of Z√ºrich lesbian organization Amicitia and August Bambula of the gay men's Excentric Club Z√ºrich. The first issue was eight pages, credited editor \\"Fredy-Torrero\\" (Laura Thoma's alias) and proclaimed two related mottos: \\"Through light to freedom.\\" and \\"Through struggle to victory\\". After a short pause it returned in 1933 under the changed title Schweizerisches Freundschaftsbanner. In 1937 its name changed again to (Human Rights) and finally to in 1942. The magazine originally focused on lesbian issues and was political in nature. Lesbianism was not criminalized in Switzerland at the time, unlike male homosexuality. From 1933 to 1942 it was published under the editorial leadership of Anna Vock who initially published under her real name, and later under the pen name \\"Mammina\\". Vock and other writers came under attack from the tabloids and in an effort to stoke moral outrage about homosexuality, publishing Vock's home addresses and leading to a repeated loss of employment. By 1942 most of the lesbian editorial staff had left and the magazine became exclusively focussed on gay male interests; the actor Karl Meier took over as the chief editor in 1942, using the pen name \\"Rolf\\", and renamed the magazine (The Circle). In 1942 the magazine's bimonthly circulation was around 200 copies, and by 1957 this had increased to 1,900, including 700 subscribers throughout Europe and the United States. It was the only gay magazine that continued publication through the Third Reich and the only gay publication that was available in Europe during World War II. was published in multiple languages: it was originally written in German, but a French section was added in 1942 and an English section in 1954. It contained news, short stories, poems, photographs, illustrations, and reports on scientific research. Although Swiss publications were censored for much of the duration of magazine's publication, the editors of were noted to have evaded censorship of \\"racier texts\\" in the English section since the censors were unable to read them. By and large, the magazine contained very little risqu√© content since Meier wanted to promote \\"a high- minded vision of homosexuality\\" that valued friendship over sex. The magazine's leadership began to decline in the 1960s, since younger gay readers were more inclined to buy Scandinavian publications that published pornography and nude photographs, and the last issue was published in 1967.  The editors of formed a society called , to which all readers were offered membership. The club held weekly meetings in Z√ºrich, where readers gathered to meet other men, discuss current affairs, and listen to lectures hosted by the club; small meetings for French readers were also held in Paris. hosted an international ball in Z√ºrich each year which attracted hundreds of gay men from around Europe. The club disbanded in 1967 when the magazine ceased publication. Legacy In Hubert Kennedy's book The Ideal Gay Man, which chronicles the history of , Kennedy describes the magazine as having been \\"the world's most important journal promoting the legal and social rights of gay men\\" for much of its publication period and one of very few such journals in Europe at the time. Additionally, it remains the only gay publication to include editorial content in three languages. In 2014, the magazine's history was documented in a Swiss docudrama film eponymously titled The Circle. The film, which features a mix of historical footage from the 1950s and dramatisations of events, won the Teddy Award and the Panorama Audience Award in the documentary category at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival.

History  While tabloid coverage of these creatures has claimed that tales of black-eyed children have existed since the 1980s, most sources indicate that the legend originated from 1996 postings written by Texas reporter Brian Bethel on a \\"ghost-related mailing list,\\" relating two alleged encounters with \\"black-eyed kids.\\" Bethel describes encountering two such children in Abilene, Texas in 1996, and claims that a second person had a similar, unrelated encounter in Portland, Oregon. Bethel's stories have become regarded as classic examples of creepypasta, and gained such popularity that he published a FAQ \\"just to keep up with demand for more info about the new urban legend.\\" In 2012, Brian Bethel told his story on reality TV series Monsters and Mysteries in America. He wrote a follow-up article for the Abilene Reporter News, describing his experience and maintaining his belief that it was legitimate. In 2012, the horror film Black Eyed Kids was produced with Kickstarter funding, its director commenting that the creepy children were \\"an urban legend that's been floating around on the Internet for years now, I always thought it was fascinating.\\" A 2013 episode of MSN's Weekly Strange that featured reports of black eyed children is thought to have helped spread the legend on the internet. During one week in September 2014, the British tabloid Daily Star ran three sensationalistic front-page stories about alleged sightings of black-eyed children, connected to the sale of a supposedly haunted pub in Staffordshire. The paper claimed a \\"shock rise in sightings around the world\\". Alleged sightings are taken seriously by ghost hunters, some of whom believe black eyed children to be extraterrestrials, vampires, or ghosts. Science writer Sharon A. Hill was unable to find any documentation of black-eyed child encounters, concluding that the tales are passed on as \\"friend of a friend\\" ghost stories. Hill considers the legend to resemble \\"typical spooky folklore stories\\" such as the phantom black dog, where the subject is not supernatural, and there may never have been an actual original encounter. Snopes lists this phenomenon as being a legend.

Notable Judgments  In Pradyuman Bisht vs. Union of India & Ors. case of installation of CCTV cameras in Courts, Tribunals, the Bench headed by Justice Goel and Justice Lalit held that by installation of CCTV cameras the objective of transparent judicial system can be achieved. Justice Goel initiated the idea of usage of technology in matrimonial dispute. In Krishna Veni Nigam vs. Harish Nigam, the Bench was of the opinion that, ‚Äútools like video conferencing should be used in matrimonial cases where the place of adjudication is not convenient to either of the parties.‚Äù The Bench further said that, \\"it may be appropriate that available technology of video conferencing is used where both the parties have equal difficulty and there is no place which is convenient to both the parties.\\" Justice Goel‚Äôs judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations. The Bench held that, a Government official cannot be prosecuted on mere allegation of committing an offence under the Act without the sanction of appointing authority. Thereafter, to cut down the backlog of cases, Justice Goel had given a specific deadline for dealing with cases of bail application and two years time for disposing of cases dealing with serious crime. The Bench in Krishnakant Tamrakar vs. The State of M.P. asked ‚Äúall high courts to issue directions to subordinate courts that all bail applications should normally be disposed of by judicial officers within one week.

While giving the guidelines, he observed that, ‚ÄúIt is a matter of serious concern that large number of cases continues to be filed under Section 498A alleging harassment of married women. To remedy the situation, we are of the view that involvement of civil society in the aid of administration of justice can be one of the steps, apart from the investigating officers and the concerned trial courts being sensitized. It is also necessary to facilitate closure of proceedings where a genuine settlement has been reached instead of parties being required to move High Court only for that purpose‚Äù. With a view to achieve a progressive step, Justice Goel in his judgment in Amardeep Singh vs. Harveen Kaur ., held that, ‚Äúthe 6 months waiting period prescribed under Section 13B(2) of Hindu Marriage Act for divorce by mutual consent is not mandatory, and can be waived under certain circumstances.
