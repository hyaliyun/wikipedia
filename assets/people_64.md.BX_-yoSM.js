The band has released three albums under the name Bobgoblin, which included one major-label release on MCA Records, and two albums under the Adventures of Jet name. The band is known for wearing dark flight suits with numbers on the back and helmets during live performances. With punk, post-punk, new wave, and 1970s glam influences, Bobgoblin took cues from bands such as The Clash with a satirically militant and anti-establishment stance mixed with the theatrics of David Bowie's backing band, The Spiders From Mars. Early Years (1993-1996) Bobgoblin formed in 1993 while drummer Rob Avsharian and lead vocalist/keyboardist Hop Litzwire were in college at the University of North Texas in Denton. The band initially formed under the constructs of a futuristic, metaphorical concept with the band being at the center of a war between a giant corporate/fascist state and a small sovereign state, The Liberation Front States, which endeavored to preserve individual freedom. In the concept, all of the members of the band are part of a patrol group called The Liberation Front States Motor Forces (LFSMF). Under the guise of this concept, Bobgoblin wore (and still wear) conforming jumpsuits that were the issued attire for the LFSMF. For their first shows in 1993, Hop's brother, credited as Hech Mahech, joined the band on bass, and guitarist Lech Vogner, another University of North Texas graduate, to round out the band. Capitalizing on Hop and Hech's professional video experience, the first performances were complete with several old, salvaged televisions displaying chaotic montages edited together by Hop and Hech. The 1993 line-up produced a four-song demo tape called \\"Rocket Box,\\" which was distributed in the Dallas- Fort Worth area and used to book initial shows. In 1994, Bobgoblin independently released the full-length album \\"Jet,\\" which helped increase the band's audience and made a name for themselves in the region while laying a foundation for their '70s and '80s punk, glam, and new wave-influenced sound. The band temporarily shut down, however, when both Hech Mahech and Lech Vogner left the band for professional reasons that same year. In 1994, Tony Jannotta (conceptually named Corporal Glascock) joined the band on bass and helped revamp the Bobgoblin concept. From 1994 to 1996, the band enlisted several different guitar players as it built interest from audiences and record labels with record-producer/guitar-player and long-time friend Barry Poynter filling in the gaps on guitar as Bobgoblin continued to build a buzz. Major-Label Years on MCA (1996-1999) In 1996, Bobgoblin signed with major label MCA Records, and with Barry Poynter acting as producer and guitar-player, they recorded \\"12-Point Master Plan.\\" Jason Weisenberg of Dallas joined the band as the full-time guitarist upon the completion of the record. \\"12-Point Master Plan\\" was released in spring 1997 and landed in the Top 75 chart on the College Music Journal. But with MCA struggling to deal with administrative problems and personnel changes, the record had difficulty reaching an audience. The band toured and tried to capitalize on radio play throughout the country. Bobgoblin won an award at the 1998 USA International Film Festival in the category of \\"Outstanding Audio/Visual Production\\" for the Enhanced CD version of \\"12-Point Master Plan,\\" which was one of the first of its kind in the music industry. Ahlby Galutin, an award-winning record producer most famous for his work with the Bee Gees and one of the creators of the Enhanced CD technology, worked at MCA at the time and pegged Bobgoblin as guinea pigs to experiment with the new technology in a CD release because of the band's conceptual bent and computer savvy members. In 1999, after delivering the rough drafts for a second record to MCA, the band left the label to try to build a new life under a different name. The Adventures of Jet (2000-2004) Based on Bobgoblin's first release, \\"Jet,\\" the band renamed itself The Adventures of Jet (simply known as AOJ). In 2000, AOJ released \\"Part 3: Coping with Insignificance\\" on independent label My Records, headed by Lagwagon frontman Joey Cape. The record, thematically centered on the band's experiences in the corporate music world and with corporate conventions in general, accentuates more of Litzwire's keyboard counter-melodies and brought the band's '80s new-wave influences more to the fore. The record attracted a limited but international and avid following, almost completely separate from the audience built under Bobgoblin. The band parted ways with Jason Weisenberg, and after some dormancy enlisted long-time friend Zach Blair (Rise Against, Hagfish) on guitar. After some time with Blair on guitar, the band changed directions once again when Jannotta returned to his first love as the guitar-player, and the band enlisted long-time friend and recording engineer Darian Stribling as the bass-player. AOJ released its second album, \\"Muscle,\\" in 2004 on Suburban Home Records. Combining themes of aging with a car-song concept, the record did not resonate enough to build on the foundation that \\"Part 3\\" had laid. Break Up and Reunion (2004 to current) With Litzwire and Jannotta establishing families, the band called it quits after 2004 doing only the occasional Bobgoblin reunion show during the next few years. In 2009‚Äì2010, inspired by renewed socio-political angst, the band returned to the Bobgoblin moniker and to its more abrasive influences to begin working on new songs. In 2011, only able to record a little bit at a time because of professional time constraints, Bobgoblin's power-pop sound returned when it released the first part of a proposed longer record, an EP called \\"Love Lost for Blood Lust,\\" which it completed and released as an LP in 2014. Bobgoblin is currently recording a classic-arcade tribute EP, which is expected to be released in 2014, that is taking concepts from the band member's favorite video games of their youth and mixing them with social commentary. Personal life Hop Litzwire, lead vocalist and keyboard player for Bobgoblin, won three Emmy Awards in 2010 for his documentary film on Arkansas cemeteries, \\"Silent Storytellers\\", which has had showings at the Bill Clinton School for Public Service.

Live recordings of it appear as the fourth track on Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979 (2001) and as the thirteenth track on Cohen's Live in London (2009). It continued to feature regularly in his stage performances until his death. Theme and lyrics The theme of the song is that of sexual infidelity and it is built around the refrain \\"And where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?\\" It implicitly references the folk-song, which exists in many versions (e.g. \\"The Gypsy Rover\\", \\"The Black Jack Davy\\", \\"The Raggle-Taggle Gypsy\\"), of the well-born bride who runs away with the gypsies. In Cohen's version, it is the gypsy himself who comes home looking for his wife and finds her gone. The song then moves in a more biblical direction, referencing Judith and Holofernes (coloured by details from the stories of Salome and Ruth) in the line \\"Whose head is this she's dancing with on the threshing-floor?\\", and later Genesis 7‚Äì8, the story of Noah and the Flood. In her 2012 work, Cohen biographer Sylvie Simmons writes of the song: \\"Its sensual melody is paired with dark accusatory lyrics that are biblical in tone.\\" She called the stern sense of loss Cohen voiced, in the song, \\"a touch disproportionate\\", given his long history of finding lovers who were already in relationships with other men. Composition Cohen explained that he wrote the song partly about the break-up of his own long-term relationship with the Los Angeles graphic artist Suzanne Elrod in 1978. In an interview for the 1979 Harry Rasky documentary film The Song of Leonard Cohen, he said: > \\"The Gypsy‚Äôs Wife\\" was one of the last and swiftest songs I‚Äôve written. I > started it in Los Angeles around the time I began recording [Recent Songs], > which was last March or April [1978], and the song was ready in about three > months. And, of course, my own marriage was breaking up at the time and, in > a sense, it was written for my gypsy wife, in other words the wife that was > wandering away. But in another way it's just a song about the way men and > women have lost one another, that men and women have wandered away from each > other and have become gypsies to each other. The last verse says There is no > man or woman you can't touch. But you who come between them, you will be > judged. In other words, even though we are in the midst of some kind of > psychic catastrophe it's not an invitation to take advantage of it, and > that's mostly what the song is about. Although Cohen referred in this interview to his \\"marriage\\" to Suzanne Elrod he later pointed out that \\"cowardice\\" and \\"fear\\" had prevented him from actually marrying her., Elrod is the mother of both of Cohen's children: his son Adam Cohen (born 1972) and daughter Lorca (born 1974). Cohen first performed \\"The Gypsy's Wife\\" live on stage in Paris on 10 October 1979. When he performed it live in Tel Aviv, Israel, on 24 November 1980, he introduced it with the words: \\"This is a little song that I wrote for my wife after she ran away.\\" Cover versions and translations The Canadian singer Patricia O'Callaghan has recorded two different cover versions of the song: the first with the Gryphon Trio on the album Broken Hearts & Madmen (2011) and the second on her solo album Matador: The Songs of Leonard Cohen (2012). The Spanish flamenco cantaor (singer) Juan Rafael Cort√©s Santiago, who performs as Duquende, has recorded a Spanish translation, \\"Mi Gitana\\" (\\"My Gypsy Wife\\"), of the song (2007).

It is a remake of the 2011 Telugu film Dookudu which itself was partially inspired from the 2003 German tragicomedy film Good Bye, Lenin!. It was directed by K. Madesh and produced by Ram Achata, Gopichand Achanta, and Anil Sunkara for 14 Reels Entertainment. It features Puneeth Rajkumar and Trisha in lead roles, alongside Prabhu, Kelly Dorjee, Rangayana Raghu, Sadhu Kokila in supporting roles.  Plot  Krishna Prasad (Prabhu) is a politician driven by idealistic values and a sense of social service. His followers are his brother Sathya (Dharma), and supporters (Shobharaj, Sharath Lohitashwa). The people of Krishnanna's constituency elect him as a legislator. Krishna an ardent follower of Dr. Rajkumar, establishes his own independent political empire, consensus with ideals proposed by Rajkumar. Krishna Prasad's dream is to see his son as a politician revered by people. During this time, he meets with a fatal accident, in which his brother and his followers are also killed. 14 years later, Krishna Prasad's son Bharath (Puneeth Rajkumar) becomes a daring super-cop in Mumbai. He is on a mission to apprehend mafia don Nayak (Kelly Dorjee), who is involved in illegal drug trade, extortion and arms trafficking. It is later revealed that Krishna prasad actually survived the accident but ended up in a state of coma. However, this truth is hidden by Krishna Prasad's family from the people. Bharath maintains a low profile to catch Nayak. In an undercover operation in Spain, Bharath gets hold of Nayak's brother, Bablu. Later, it is revealed that corrupt opposition leader (Doddanna), who is also tied up with Nayak, was the mastermind behind Krishna Prasad's accident, and had planned to derail Krishna's political empire as he was opposing his illegal businesses and relation with Nayak. Bharath falls in love with Prasanthi (Trisha), whom he meets in Spain during his operation. Prasanthi is the daughter of Bharath's higher officer (Avinash), a cop who reports to the police commissioner (Vinod Alwa) in Bangalore city. When Bharath's dad comes out of the coma, doctors advise his family that Krishna Prasad is at risk if he encounters or hears anything upsetting, disturbing or shocking. Bharath hides the events surrounding his dad's accident & shifts his family to his dad's previously abandoned mansion, which is now being used for film making. Bharath creates a dummy political set-up at this mansion. In the guise of a reality television program, Bharath tricks an aspiring but unsuccessful film actor P. Vibhushan (Rangayana Raghu), by making him believe that the television show is being sponsored by film star V. Ravichandran, and that Ravichandran wants to offer P. Vibhushan very high remuneration for his realistic performance in the show. On the other hand, an aspiring actor Kamangi Kidney (Sadhu Kokila) is also tricked by Bharath. Bharath also tricks Gouda with a real estate business deal, to exploit his criminal nexus. Bharath keeps this drama under wraps from Krishna Prasad, by making Krishna Prasad believe that Bharath is now an M.L.A., revered by people fulfilling his dad's wishes. He also marries his love, Prasanthi, to make his father happy. The rest of the plot reveals the politician-criminal nexus behind Krishna Prasad's accident, the comic misadventures which lead to Krishna Prasad knowing the truth, and Bharath's retaliation over Nayak and Rudresh's political corruption.

Walsh's disappearance was widely publicized into the late 1990s, especially after several newspapers and media outlets published articles implying that her disappearance was potentially linked to the Russian mafia or New York City's underground vampire community, both subjects that she had investigated while writing for The Village Voice. Walsh's case has been profiled on multiple television programs, including Unsolved Mysteries in 1997 and Disappeared in 2012. Walsh was also the subject of a 1998 book titled Piercing the Darkness: Undercover with Vampires in America Today by Katherine Ramsland. Early life Susan Walsh was born Susan Young on February 18, 1960. She aspired to be a poet from a young age. Her upbringing has been described as \\"troubled.\\" Walsh attended William Paterson University where she studied English and writing; while there, she was employed as a journalist for the university newspaper. Walsh worked intermittently as an erotic dancer and stripper to help foot the bill of her tuition. Notwithstanding her struggles with substance abuse and alcoholism, she graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in 1988 and afterward worked as a writer for engineering and business publications. She was later employed as a writer for Screw magazine. She married Mark Walsh, a brother of musician Joe Walsh, in 1984. The couple had one son, David, born in 1985. Disappearance On July 16, 1996, Walsh left her apartment complex in Nutley, New Jersey, which she shared with her son; her estranged husband, Mark, lived below them. Walsh had left to run errands and make a telephone call at a payphone across the street, leaving her son for the time being in the care of his father. It was the last time that Walsh was seen. At the time of her disappearance, she had been enrolled in a Master's program in English at New York University, which she had halfway completed, whilst supporting herself and her son by working as a freelance journalist and in various jobs as a stripper. At the time of her disappearance, her friends had become worried that she had relapsed into her drug addiction, after having maintained eleven years of sobriety.Disappeared. \\"Dancing into Darkness\\". Investigation Discovery Network. September 8, 2012. Investigation Police were able to eliminate Walsh's ex-husband as a suspect in her vanishing. It was noted later that the page for the entire month of July 1996 was missing from Walsh's calendar in her apartment. Although police had few clues to follow up on in their investigation, rumors circulated that Walsh's disappearance might have been connected to the investigative journalism she had been doing at the time. Walsh had penned an in-depth report published in The Village Voice about a strip club ring in which members of the Russian mafia were allegedly forcing young girls into the sex industry. Following this article, Walsh had also explored an underground vampire community in New York City, but the newspaper did not run the story as it felt Walsh's writing on the matter was not objective. Ultimately, police were unable to establish any connections between Walsh's disappearance and her work on either article. Walsh established a friendship with journalist James Ridgeway during her time writing for the Voice, with Ridgeway referring to her as his \\"most reliable\\" writer. At the time, Walsh had also participated in a documentary produced by her friend, Jill Morley, titled Stripped, which detailed women working in the sex industry. Walsh was recorded in a group interview for the film on July 14, 1996, two days before her disappearance, during which she made a reference to having a \\"stalker.\\" She had also hired herself out to a German documentary crew making a film about Russian immigrants becoming go-go dancers, and was also in the midst of developing a documentary on the subject with the BBC shortly before her disappearance. Walsh's last work was her contributions to the book Red Light: Inside the Sex Industry by Ridgeway and Sylvia Plachy; Walsh served as the primary researcher for the book and also contributed photographs and personal writings within a month before her disappearance. In a 2006 article in The New York Post, it was noted that Walsh had confided to a former boyfriend that another of her ex-boyfriends had been stalking her; additionally, the article stated that her husband, Mark, had refused to allow police to perform forensic testing of their home.

The hostages were subsequently moved to Geselama. The International Committee of the Red Cross acted as an intermediary between the OPM and the Indonesian authorities. Fifteen hostages, all of Indonesian nationality, were released relatively quickly, but eleven (comprising four Britons, two Dutch, and five Indonesians) remained in OPM hands. After lengthy negotiations the ICRC secured an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages on 8 May. However, the OPM leader, Kelly Kwalik, backed out of the agreement on the day of the intended release. The ICRC removed itself from the negotiations and stated that the Indonesian Army was no longer bound by an agreement not to engage in combat with the hostage takers. On 9 May Indonesian Army Special Forces (Kopassus) moved into the village but found it unoccupied. Five personnel were killed in a helicopter crash. A small observation force was left behind and, after this confirmed the OPM and their hostages had returned to the site on 15 May, a second assault was made. This was successful and effected the release of nine of the hostages, two being killed by their captors. Eight OPM fighters were killed and two captured versus no loss on the Indonesian side, save for the helicopter crash. There was some international controversy over the use of an unmarked civilian helicopter by the Indonesian forces, which may have misled the OPM.  Hostage-taking and negotiations  On 8 January 1996, 200 members of the Free Papua Movement (OPM) took 26 hostages from the village of Mapenduma in Irian Jaya. The hostages comprised 20 Indonesians, four Britons, and two Dutch ‚Äì the latter including a pregnant woman ‚Äì and all were part of a World Wildlife Fund mission conducting biodiversity research. Fifteen of the Indonesian hostages were released swiftly by the OPM leader Kelly Kwalik. On 14 January the OPM demanded the use of an aircraft and a meeting with four priests or missionaries. The Catholic Bishop of Jayapura, Herman Ferdinandus Maria M√ºnninghoff, made contact with Kwalik on 25 January to begin negotiations. Kwalik requested that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) act as an intermediary between the OPM and the Indonesian authorities. The ICRC consulted with the British, Dutch, and Indonesian governments before agreeing to take on this role. A five-member negotiating team arrived in the area on 7 February but, owing to bad weather, dense jungle, and logistical problems, was unable to make contact with the hostage-takers until 25 February, when they were located at Geselama. The ICRC team were able to meet with a number of the hostages, under OPM supervision on this occasion and on their four subsequent visits (26‚Äì27 March, 17 April, 5 May, and 8 May). The ICRC noted that there were serious concerns regarding the health of three of the hostages, including Martha Klein, the pregnant Dutchwoman, and attempted to provide vitamin supplements and a means of communication with the hostages' families. The Indonesian authorities made little progress with negotiations as Kwalik refused to back down from his demand for immediate independence for western New Guinea. However, the ICRC insisted that negotiations continue, and by early May had arranged the release of the hostages in exchange for free passage for the hostage-takers and medical and agricultural projects to be implemented in Irian Jaya. A release ceremony was organised for 8 May at which many local tribal leaders were present. At the last moment, as the ICRC were preparing to leave with the hostages, Kwalik retracted his offer and again demanded independence for western New Guinea. The ICRC declared that as the OPM had backed out of the previous agreement, they would be unable to continue as an intermediary, that hostage-taking was prohibited by international law, and that the Indonesian forces would no longer be bound by their agreement to not engage in combat. There was a dispute amongst the OPM with some members stating that the hostages would be released on 9 May. The ICRC representatives returned the next day to find that the hostages had been moved to a different location and that Kwalik refused to change his stance.  Rescue operation  Indonesian Army Special Forces (Kopassus) for the rescue operation were under the command of Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo, son-in-law of President Suharto. He arranged two Bell 412 helicopters to be shipped into the area via C-130 aircraft and used these, along with three other helicopters, to enter Geselama on 9 May. The rescue team found the village deserted and, leaving behind a Kopassus observation team, withdrew. During the withdrawal, a helicopter hit a tree and crashed, killing all five personnel on-board. Kopassus confirmed that the OPM and the hostages had returned to the village on 15 May. Prabawo immediately launched another helicopter assault, code-named Operation Cenderawasih (Bird of Paradise). This operation resulted in the safe release of nine of the hostages, two of the Indonesian hostages having been killed during the course of the operation. Eight OPM fighters were killed and two captured. The May 15 operation was carried out by 100 Kopassus soldiers with access to an airborne surveillance drone and sniffer dogs. It was almost cancelled after the airbase from which it was to be launched was stormed by several thousand locals intent on burning the helicopters, who had to be repelled by rubber bullets. Kopassus took several hours to carry out the rescue and were able to locate the OPM forces by following a trail of discarded personal belongings. The two hostages that were killed bled to death after being struck by machetes by the OPM; Klein was slightly wounded after being struck by a spear. The survivors were stranded on the mountainside overnight by bad weather before being evacuated to Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital. Three of the hostages were admitted to intensive care but the remainder were in relatively good condition. Allegations were made regarding the ICRC's involvement in the incident, including that it co-operated with the Indonesian forces to organise the military operation and that it allowed the Indonesian forces to disguise themselves under the Red Cross emblem (particularly by using a red cross-marked helicopter). The ICRC investigated the matter and could not find any evidence of such events. The Indonesian Army admitted to using a white civilian helicopter (in Airfast Indonesia livery) to lead the assault, which had been used previously to ferry the ICRC representatives. They state that it was not marked with the red cross and was accompanied by two A√©rospatiale SA 330 Puma in Indonesian Army markings. But they admit that it may have caused confusion to the OPM forces. Several sources state that private military company Executive Outcomes provided training and operational advise to the Indonesian government on the rescue operation.

Plot In this version, the character of Gwynplaine is renamed Angelo (played by Jean Sorel). His disfigurement is represented as a single broad slash across his mouth, crude yet convincing. While he deals with this, he also falls for a beautiful girl named Dea. The story (which is attributed, in the movie credits, to the director, producer and others involved in making the film, but not to Victor Hugo) has the disfigured acrobat being seduced by a noblewoman and in so doing becomes a henchman for the Borgias. Meanwhile, Dea miraculously acquires her eyesight and falls in love with a young nobleman. This nobleman is marked for death not just by Angelo's employers but by Angelo as well over the loss of Dea. Angelo's assassination attempt fails and he is mortally wounded. In the final scene the escaping Angelo staggers into a Leper Colony and falls dead.

This was introduced by British physicist and chemist Joseph Swan in 1864. It has been used in photographic reproduction since the early days of photography. Carbon materials marketing began in 1866 by Joseph Swan which he subsequently sold to the Autotype Company in 1868. His ready-made tissues were in three colours black, sepia and purple-brown. This method was used in Europe and USA throughout the 19th century and well into the 20th. This market was almost closed in the 1950s although some companies produce small amount of carbon tissue and transfer papers for monochrome and three-color work until around 1990  Method  The gelatinous emulsion is applied to a paper backing, and is rendered sensitive to light when immersed in a 3:4% solution of potassium bichromate. After drying, it is ready for use. The carbon tissue is first exposed to a film positive. In those areas where the carbon tissue has received the most light (i.e., non-image areas and highlights) the emulsion becomes thick and hard, and the thickness and hardness decreases with decreasing exposure to the light source, the emulsion being thinnest and softest in image areas corresponding to shadows and solids. After developing the carbon tissue, it is adhered to the surface of the copper-plated cylinder. A solution of ferric chloride etchant is applied to the surface of the cylinder, where it eats away the copper through the carbon tissue. In the highly exposed areas, where the carbon tissue photoresist is thickest and hardest, the etchant takes a long time to eat through the hard emulsion, while in the least exposed, thinnest regions the etchant eats through the resist into the copper very quickly. Thus, in a given period of etching, the cells etched into the copper will be deepest (and thus will print the darkest) in those regions where the etchant has eaten through the quickest, while the cells etched into the copper will be the shallowest (and thus print the lightest) in those regions where the etchant has eaten through the slowest.  Usage  Carbon tissue resists were the first chemical etching media, but have been replaced by photopolymers, and chemical etching as a whole is being increasingly replaced by electromechanical engraving and computer-to-cylinder laser-cutting processes. (See Gravure Engraving.) Carbon tissue resists have also been used extensively for the manufacture of photostencils in screen printing.

Iversen, was a Danish architect active in Malaysia, and the founder of Iversen, van Sitteren & Partners. Most of his works were in Malaya (now Malaysia) and Singapore. He designed a large number of buildings in his Malayan home town, Ipoh. He eventually had offices in Ipoh, Penang, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. He did a large number of cinemas throughout Malaysia for the Shaw Brothers, a film production company which was the precursor to the Shaw Organization.Ruth Iversen Rollitt, 2015. Iversen: Architect of Ipoh and Modern Malaya. George Town, Penang: Areca Books. Iversen‚Äôs early works are sometimes described as Art Deco, but after World War II, his buildings became increasingly modern, and he became one of Southeast Asia‚Äôs most important modernists. His works were an integral part economically and symbolically for the newly developed countries of Malaysia and Singapore. Personal life Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1906, Berthel Michael was the youngest of seven siblings in the Iversen family. He was named after the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. He exhibited an artistic streak from a young age, and graduated from the Royal Academy in Copenhagen in architecture. He relocated to Ipoh, Malaysia. He was married and had two children, Ruth Iversen Rollitt (daughter) and Per Iversen (son). In 1966, Iversen retired and left his firm to his son Per and his Chinese partners. He died in Copenhagen in 1976, age 70. Career In 1928, Iversen came to Malaya (Malaysia) and started his career as an architect. His elder brother Werner Iversen had been a successful planter in Malaya since 1918, and convinced Berthel to relocate. Young Iversen worked for Keys And Dowdeswell firm when he first landed Asia. In 1936, Iversen established his own firm with S.H van Sitteren in Ipoh- Iversen, van Sitteren & Partners. Iversen was a member of the Building Association of Ipoh, in the state of Perak. He was responsible for some of the famous modernist landmark buildings in Ipoh, including the Ipoh Race Course. He designed a large number of cinemas for his hometown, including the Lido., Rex, Majestic (demolished), Ruby, Odeon and Cathay cinemas, many of which are still standing. Also for the Shaw Brothers he designed Jubilee Park which was an outdoor entertainment centre and cinema. The Mercantile Bank, Lam Looking Bazaar, Geological Survey Building, Ipoh Swimming Club, and MCA are some of his prominent projects in Ipoh. List of buildings designed by B. M.

His oeuvre includes numerous government buildings, hospitals, schools, cinemas, radio stations, and churches. Awards In 1950, Iversen won in a design competition for a post office saving bank in Malaya while he was recovering from a kidney operation; the prize was $5000. This prominent building eventually became the Federal House, and it is today the Rumah Persekutuan. 15 architects took part in the competition and Iversen's entry placed first. The final working drawings were completed at the end of 1951 and the foundation was completed in May 1952. There was a change of plan when the Post Office Savings Bank would not be accommodated in this building and used entirely for Government Offices. The main block remained unaltered but the two storey block was increased to be the same height as the main building and an additional storey was later added to accommodate Radio Malaya. The reinforced concrete frame-work was designed so that all secondary beams and slabs are of uniform spam and size, thus reducing the cost of frame-work. Federal House is one of the earliest building to use plastic as a building material. The exterior of the solid panel is covered with green vitrolite with aluminium cover beads over the joints. The upper part of the panel is filled in with 'Cooper' glass louvers, which forms a continuous window. The delightful visual quality of the facade treatment was later compromised when the occupants painted the clear glass panels to reduce the sun glare and resultant heat gain. Buildings Front view of Jubilee Park, Ipoh Jubilee Park Once called \\"Ipoh Amusement Park\\", Jubilee Park was owned by the Shaw Brothers. Originally the park was used as an entertainment space to raise money for the victims of the China 1931 flood. It was then bought by Archibald Russel who leased the park to the Shaw Brothers, 30 April 1935. Scenes from director Mamat Khalid‚Äôs film Zombi Kilang Biskut (2013) were filmed in front of the modern fa√ßade. Lam Look Ing Bazaar Lam Look Ing Bazaar (often written as Lam Looking Bazaar),1933, is located in Jalan Laksamana, Ipoh. Iversen was commissioned to design the project for Penang-born mining tycoon Lam Look Ing. It originally housed a bazaar at street level, and a hotel and the Celestial Cabaret occupied the upper floors. It was a favourite watering hole for European expatriates up until World War II when it became a favorite spot for Japanese officers. In the 1970s, Lam Look Ing Bazaar housed the Perak Emporium, an early incarnation of the air-conditioned department store. The emporium closed down following an economic downturn, and the building became dilapidated. A fire exacerbated its condition. Recently the Lam Look Ing Bazaar was bought and restored. This included a new roof but much of the original design was faithfully retained. The Geological Survey Geological Survey Building, Ipoh This Geological Survey Building, Ipoh, Perak, was an early Iversen work. This cornerstone for the building in Ipoh was laid by YM Raja Idris Shah ibin Almarhum Sultan Iskandar Shah, the Raja Muda of Perak in July, 1955 Iversen was hired to remodel and enlarge his project, and the building‚Äôs library includes a mosaic floor of the Malayan Peninsula. The Masonic Lodge The Masonic Lodge It is a freemason which built by B.M Iversen during the early 1930s, it is the second lodge.

Union Bank. Lido Theatre, Ipoh Lido Theatre (Chinese: ‰∏ΩÈÉΩÔºõ‰∏ΩÈÉΩÊàèÈô¢) is one of the cinemas designed by BM Iversen estimated between 1955 and 1957. Located across the Cockman Street, Ipoh (currently Jalan Dato Onn Jaafar) from the Cathay Theatre. It was demolished by fire and then later renovated and became a snooker center until current. Legacy of Iversen The firm Iversen established lives on under the name Pakatan Akitek Sdn Bhd, in Kuala Lumpur, and there are literally hundreds of buildings in the Malayan peninsular from either B.M. Iversen or Iversen, Van Sitteren and Partners. Just as the new nation of Malaysia adopted modern architecture in many of its prominent buildings (the parliament, the airport, the stadia), Iversen brought architectural modernism to the commercial realm. The international style became a force in Southeast Asia in no small part due to Iversen's efforts. Gallery Lam Look Ing Bazaar.jpgFront view of Lam Look Ing Bazaar, Ipoh.

It is considered a boy's adventure novel. In the novel, Joe Bronson, dissatisfied with his dull life at school, runs away and joins the crew of a sloop he sees in San Francisco Bay. He finds the captain is involved in criminal activities. The nautical activities on board a sailing boat are authentically described, and there are convincing descriptions of boats enduring stormy weather at sea. Background London, in his autobiographical novel John Barleycorn, describes how in his youth he bought a sloop called the Razzle Dazzle from an oyster pirate called French Frank. In The Cruise of the Dazzler, the captain of the Dazzler is known as French Pete, who, like French Frank, drinks to the success of business ventures. London himself became an oyster pirate., from chapter 7.Jack London Famous Authors, accessed June 16, 2014. Story summary Joe Bronson, instead of studying for a school exam, goes to buy kites with his friends; on their way back he gets involved in fights with gang members in a poor part of the city. After he fails the exam the next day, he walks out of school and takes a ferry across the bay to Oakland. Looking at the boats on the wharf, he imagines the exciting life on a boat. His father, a businessman, has a liberal attitude to his son; but, critical of his recent behavior and a poor school report, tells him that he might send him to a military academy. Joe later leaves a farewell note for his family; returning to Oakland, he joins the crew of a sloop, the Dazzler. The captain Pete Le Maire is known as \\"French Pete\\", and the one other crew member is 'Frisco Kid, a boy of about Joe's age. He soon realizes that French Pete is involved in criminal activity. They take scrap iron from a factory; the job is abandoned when shots are fired. Later, they work as oyster pirates. Joe, not wanting to be involved in crime, tries to escape, but each time is thwarted. French Pete tolerates Joe's opinion of him that he is a criminal. 'Frisco Kid tells Joe that he hates his life at sea; he had no family, and once worked for Red Nelson on another sloop, the Reindeer, but ran away. Arrested as a tramp, he was sent to a \\"boy's refuge\\", where conditions were intolerable; he escaped and joined French Pete. Joe resolves to leave and take 'Frisco Kid with him. French Pete and his associate Red Nelson steal a safe. Joe sees that it belongs to his father's company. The Dazzler and Reindeer sail into the Pacific, pursued for a time by a yacht; they intend to sail to Mexico. There is soon a storm and the Dazzler's mast breaks. The Reindeer gets close enough for French Pete to jump onto it but, before the boys can follow, the Reindeer disappears under the waves. The Dazzler drifts ashore at Santa Cruz, finding a small wharf on the lower San Lorenzo River. Joe goes to his father's office. His father makes him \\"feel at once as if not the slightest thing uncommon had occurred. It seemed as if he had just returned from a vacation, or, man-grown, had come back from some business trip.\\"Chapter 21. His father, after hearing his story, says that the $5000 reward for the return of the safe would be shared, 'Frisco Kid's half being held in trust for his future.

It was built in 1845 under the supervision of Franciscan priest, Fr. Vicente Velloc as a public burial site and its underground crypt exclusively for Spanish friars, prominent town citizens and members of elite Catholic families. It is dubbed as the only underground cemetery in the country.  History  = Establishment of the Underground Cemetery = Fr. Vicente Velloc supervised the establishment of a cemetery in Nagcarlan in 1845 below Mt. San Cristobal. Unlike the traditional Spanish cemeteries at that time, Fr. Velloc decided to build it away from the town's center. The cemetery is planned to serve as a public resting place for the people of the town while the underground chamber below the chapel of the cemetery will only house remains of Spanish friars and prominent people. It was built together with the construction of the expanded St. Bartholomew Parish Church and rectory. The cemetery is built with a chapel where funeral masses were held and directly below it is an underground crypt. = As Meeting Place during the Revolution = During the Philippine Revolution, the cemetery served as a meeting place of revolutionary leaders of the Katipunan in 1896. Pedro Paterno and Gen. Severino Tai√±o of the \\"Maluningning\\" command held a meeting at the cemetery where they planned the historic Pact of Biak-na-Bato in 1897. It also served as hideout for Filipino leaders during the Philippine- American War and of guerillas in World War II. = Declaration as a Historical Landmark = The Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery was declared as a National Historical Landmark by virtue of Presidential Decree no. 260, dated August 1, 1973 with amendments by Administrative Order 1505, dated June 11, 1978. Since the declaration, no more burials were allowed in the cemetery. It underwent renovations before it was again opened to the public during the unveiling of the marker on October 24, 1981. The oldest tomb is dated 1886 while the last interment was in 1982 when it was formally declared as a National Historical Landmark.  Features  The Baroque cemetery is located two kilometers south of downtown Nagcarlan that takes the shape of a circular cemetery across a 1 hectare property. It is surrounded by octagonal stone walls made of red tiles with iron-wrought grills. A fa√ßade or arch of about 18 feet high with two iron grill gates leads to a red tiled pathway across a green space leading to the cemetery chapel. The chapel containing a statue of Santo Sepulcro serves as a place for requiem or funeral mass. Located 15 feet below the chapel is an underground graveyard consisting of only 36 tombs arranged in four walls The crypt and chapel is connected by two flight of steps. The first nine steps lead to a Spanish inscription that reads: :Go forth, Mortal man, full of life Today you visit happily this shelter, But after you have gone out, Remember, you have a resting place here, Prepared for you. The last six steps lead to the underground crypt. The cemetery has 240 apartment-type niches on the walls where each side of the chapel contains 120 niches. Overall, there are 276 niches.

Born in the village of Chopwell in Tyne and Wear, Waugh began his career as an amateur with Durham City before spending a brief spell representing his home town club of Chopwell Colliery at the start of 1921. It was while at Chopwell that Waugh was spotted by Football League club Sheffield United who signed both Waugh and fellow defender Bill Sampy for a joint fee of ¬£250 in April 1921. Waugh made a slow start to his career with the Blades and did not begin to feature regularly until November 1922, from which point he missed only one of the following 103 first team matches. Waugh was considered to lack pace and this caused him problems from 1925 when the offside rule was changed. A neck injury prevented Waugh from playing in the 1925 FA Cup Final and after a run of games at the start of the 1925‚Äì26 season he lost his place in the side to Seth King. Despite being selected for the FA tour of Canada in the summer of 1926, Waugh was unable to reclaim his place in United's starting eleven and was eventually transferred to Darlington in January 1927 after having made 143 appearances for the Blades and scored three goals. A success at his new club, Waugh was a regular member of the match day team until 1933, including being ever present during the 1929‚Äì30 season. Waugh was part of the coaching staff at Darlington for much of his time there and took up a full- time coaching position once he retired from playing. With his career nearing an end, Sheffield United played a benefit match for Waugh in April 1932 and he later returned to the club to act as a scout from 1934.

Biography  After working at Otago University and serving as head of department at Massey University, Jameson moved to the University of Canterbury where she had completed her PhD. Jameson is a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Agricultural and Horticultural Science and a life member of the New Zealand Society of Plant Physiologists.  Research  Jameson's work on the genetics of large-seed production has received international coverage. In the 1980s, Jameson gave evidence of her research findings in a controversial case involving the fertiliser Maxicrop. Fertiliser company Bell-Booth Ltd contended that Jameson was on the verge of a major breakthrough of great significance to New Zealand. However, Jameson's results were challenged by international scientists appearing for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (New Zealand), who determined that the fertiliser would have to be applied at the rate of 98,000 litres/ha to elicit a response. The case was decided against the Ministry because even though the product was likely worthless, no legal basis existed to prevent its marketing. Interviewed later about the case, Jameson said that she was not keen to revisit \\"ancient history [and the case] taught me to stand on my own two feet and taught me who my friends were.\\"  Honours and awards  In 2019, Professor Jameson was awarded the Marsden Medal by the New Zealand Association of Scientists for her work on plant cytokinins, among other work, over her extraordinary scientific career.

Incoroprated in the USA but now with an international membership, NCIS is a non-profit organization that supports independent scholars, defined as someone who is actively pursuing knowledge in an academic or scientific discipline, without secure employment in or support from an academic institution. Independent scholars include unaffiliated scholars, Adjunct professor and part-time faculty, graduate students, research professionals, artists, and curators. NCIS enables scholars working in the arts, humanities, social science and STEM fields to access and share resources, such as library access, and support, which are typically unavailable to researchers who are not affiliated with a university or other institution. An issue of great concern to independent scholars is the lack of access to libraries and journals, lack of funding, and isolation from the rest if the academic community. NCIS therefore provides discounted access to JSTOR and other academic resources, offers grants for research projects and attending academic conferences, and facilitates networking opportunities such as Facebook and Twitter, discipline-based on-line groups and local organizations of independent scholars. NCIS recognizes regional and international partner groups in Europe, the USA and Australia, and is itself an affiliate of the American Historical Association.  History  In the United States, the independent scholarship movement developed in the 1970s in response to the growing number of scholars who were not affiliated with an academic institution. Following the establishment of several early, regionally based independent scholars' societies such as The Institute for Research in History, the Princeton Research Forum, the Centre for Independent Studies, and the Alliance of Independent Scholars, the independent scholar community recognized the need for a national organization to represent independent scholars' interests on a national level. In 1986, the San Diego Independent Scholars sponsored a national conference aimed at reaching a consensus for founding a national organization which would communicate with institutions such as federal funding agencies, foundations, and learned societies, to address issues of access to research funding, research facilities, and other resources, as well as to provide a forum for scholarly exchange. Conference attendees expressed the need for a national newsletter and, in 1987, the first issue of The Independent Scholar was published. The first Board of the National Coalition of Independent Scholars was elected in 1988, and the organization was officially incorporated in 1989.DeLacy, Margaret, \\"A History of NCIS\\", Council of Chairs Newsletter, Issue 46, August 1995  Conference activities  Since the founding conference in 1987, NCIS has organized national conferences in conjunction with partner groups. ‚Ä¢ October 25, 1987 San Diego, CA: Founding conference ‚Ä¢ December 1987 Institute for Historical Study, Oakland CA: \\"Scholarship for Love and Money\\" (regional conference) ‚Ä¢ March 28, 1988: Center for Independent Study, New Haven CT (regional conference) ‚Ä¢ April 7, 1990: Cambridge, MA ‚ÄúWomen Mystery Story Writers‚Äù (one- day conference co-sponsored by NCIS) ‚Ä¢ April 23-25 1993: Chevy Chase, MD ‚ÄúIndependent Scholars in the 1990s: Intellectual and Practical Issues‚Äù (first official NCIS conference) ‚Ä¢ October 21-23, 1994: Oakland, CA ‚ÄúIndependent Scholars: Finding an Audience‚Äù ‚Ä¢ May 3-5, 1996: Princeton, NJ ‚ÄúSituating Scholarship‚Äù ‚Ä¢ October 18, 1997: San Francisco, CA \\"The Scholarly Imperative: What Inspires Independent Scholars?\\" (one-day conference). ‚Ä¢ October 2-4, 1998: St. Paul, MN \\"The Future of Scholarship: Independent?\\" ‚Ä¢ October 27-29, 2000: Raleigh, NC ‚ÄúIndependent Scholars: the Public Intellectuals of the Future‚Äù ‚Ä¢ October 4-6, 2002: Vancouver, BC, Canada ‚Ä¢ October 15-17, 2004: New York, NY ‚ÄúIndependent Scholars: Coming of Age‚Äù ‚Ä¢ October 8, 2005: Portland OR ‚ÄúSelling Your Scholarship: Writing Marketable Non-fiction‚Äù (one-day conference). ‚Ä¢ June 16-18, 2006: Princeton, NJ ‚ÄúScholars Without Borders.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ October 25-26, 2008: Berkeley, CA ‚Ä¢ June 18-21, 2015: Yale, New Haven, CT ‚ÄúTraditions and Transitions: Independent Scholars and the Digital Landscape.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ June 21-23, 2019: University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA \\"Making Connections, Meeting Challenges\\" (celebrating 30 years of NCIS).  Publications  In 1987, NCIS began publishing a print newsletter, The Independent Scholar, featuring articles by NCIS members, book reviews, announcements, and other news. In 2007 the publication switched to an open- access online platform. The final issue was published in 2014, when the online quarterly was retired and for a short time this was replaced by \\"TIS Blog\\". In 2015 an on-line, peer-reviewed journal was inaugurated. Also entitled The Independent Scholar (TIS) ISSN 2381-2400. TIS is an open-access journal through which the work of independent scholars is made available to a worldwide audience. Rigorously peer-reviewed general and themed volumes have since appeared regularly, with articles being published on line on acceptance, and then appearing in the subsequent issue.[2]  Grants  NCIS offers two internal grants to support members‚Äô academic activities, inviting ap- plications for Conference Support Grants and Research Grants three times a year. In 2016 NCIS honored the late Professor Elizabeth Eisenstein by reviving the Elizabeth Eisenstein Essay Prize. The Eisenstein Prize is awarded for the best essay by an NCIS member, and the essay must have been published in a peer-reviewed journal or book within the previous two years.

The three-hour program was distributed to more than 200 Top 40/CHR and Rhythmic stations internationally, including The Armed Forces Network.\\"American Dance Traxx\\" on AFRTS from Worldcat.org The program was hosted by Jeff Wyatt,Jeff Wyatt profile at Voice 123 then a program director of KPWR and co-produced with Joel Salkowitz from sister station WQHT/New York City. Wyatt and Salkowitz came up with the concept of putting together a program, using a similar format that was used by other Westwood One-produced programs, which featured the 25 most popular Dance songs in the United States based on radio airplay and requests. Although Westwood One had a partnership with (and later acquiring) \\"Radio & Records\\" when it came to using their charts, this was the only program that never used the R&R; chart, as there was no Dance chart in the magazine at the time. The show also used music bumpers and imaging elements were similar to the ones used at KPWR and WQHT. In addition to the airing the most popular songs, it also featured the five newest songs that were future picks, as well as the most requested slow-jams by its listeners. Wyatt also made surprise phone calls to listeners (who also mentioned the station that they were listening the show on, like WLUM/Milwaukee\\"American Dance Traxx\\" aircheck from WLUM/Milwaukee from Upper Midwest Airchecks/YouTube) and at times gave away a prize even after they played their requested song. In-between the songs, artist interviews (taped or live) were also featured. The program also featured themed countdown shows that were devoted to house, Disco, Hip-Hop and 80s Dance music, as well as annual countdowns. In October 1991, Wyatt stepped down as host after he resigned from the PD position at KPWR to join rival Los Angeles Top 40/CHR KIIS-FMRadio news from Los Angeles Times (October 31, 1991) and was temporarily succeeded by Deborah Rath (from WQHT) until March 1992, when former MTV VJ and Club MTV host Downtown Julie Brown became the permanent host,\\"Downtown Julie Brown Named Host Of Westwood One's \\"American Dance Traxx\\" from The Free Library (posted March 16, 1992) and continued in this capacity until its final broadcast in December 1993 (a year end countdown edition), when Westwood One discontinued domestic production of the program.

It was first located off Tarrytown, New York, on the Hudson River, one of eight anchorages in the United States to provide a sizable reserve of merchant ships to support any military need arising. History The Hudson River Reserve Fleet was established in the wake of World War II to provide an anchorage and place of maintenance for a part of the enormous numbers of combat vessels and transports surplussed by the return of peace. On April 30, 1946, it was moved further north to Jones Point at the foot of Dunderberg Mountain. The fleet was anchored in ten rows, extending from the fleet office at the Jones Point dock several miles to the south to the Boulderberg House at Tomkins Cove. Several viewing points were established along U.S. Route 9W for the hundreds of motorists who stopped daily to look at the ships. During the Korean War, a total of 130 ships were taken from the Hudson River fleet leaving only 39 ships. During the Suez Crisis in 1956, 35 ships were put back into service when British and French ships were diverted from trade routes to supply their nations' armed forces. The Vietnam War required more than 40 ships. When the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1953 needed storage space for large volumes of government-owned wheat, it turned to the Hudson River Reserve fleet. During the following ten years more than 53,563,948 bushels of wheat were loaded into 231 ships. A ventilation system had been installed in the ships, making it possible to maintain the quality of the wheat for long periods of storage. This saved the U.S. government some five million dollars on commercial storage estimates. The ships were kept in condition on a year-'round basis by a crew of 86 men under the supervision of Charles R. Gindroz of Pearl River, fleet superintendent and one-time chief engineer on the SS George Washington. The reserve fleet ships, valued at over $255 million, had their machinery turned over periodically and their internal surfaces sprayed with a coat of preservative oil on a regular basis. Other reserve fleets were anchored at Astoria, Oregon; Olympia, Washington; Suisun Bay, California; Mobile, Alabama; Beaumont, Texas; Wilmington, North Carolina; and James River, Virginia. The last two ships from the Hudson River fleet were towed away on July 8, 1971, to be sold for scrap to Spain. Ships not sold for scrap from it were transferred to the James River Reserve Fleet.

At the 1820 general election he was defeated by Sir David Milne, but that result was reversed on petition in July 1820, and St Paul was re-elected later the same month without a contest. However, he died on 1 November, age 43, before he could resume his seat.

He was the highest-rated two-year-old in France in 1977 when he won Prix de Cabourg and Prix Morny over sprint distances before defeating a strong field in France's premier race for juveniles, the Grand Crit√©rium. He was disappointing in three runs in 1978 and was retired to stud after having won four of his eight races. Background Super Concorde was a \\"strong, attractive\\" brown horse bred in Kentucky by Nelson Bunker Hunt. He was from the second of three crops of foals sired by Bold Reasoning, the winner of the Withers Stakes in 1971. Bold Reasoning also sired the American Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew before dying at the age of seven in 1975. Super Concorde's dam, Prime Abord won the Prix de Royallieu and finished seventh when second favourite for The Oaks in 1970. A daughter of the Oaks winner Homeward Bound, she was born with a club foot and was reportedly bought by Nelson Bunker Hunt only because his agents visited the farm during a snowstorm and failed to notice the deformity. As a yearling, Super Concorde was sent to the sales and was bought for $200,000 by representatives of Walter Haefner. The colt was sent to Europe where he was trained in France by Fran√ßois Boutin. Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Super Concorde defeated three opponents in race over 1000 metres at Chantilly Racecourse and then won the Prix de Cabourg over 1200 metres at Deauville. The colt was then moved up in class for the Group One Prix Morny run on 21 August over the same course and distance as the Prix de Cabourg and started the 8/10 favourite after Philippe Paquet elected to ride him in preference to the Prix Robert Papin winner Vific. Super Concorde led soon after the start, as he had done in his previous starts, and held on in the closing stages to win by a neck from Little Love, with the Italian colt El-Muleta a length and a half away in third. The colt started favourite for the Prix de la Salamandre over 1400m at Longchamp Racecourse on 11 September, but failed to reproduce his earlier form, fighting his jockey's attempts to restrain him and finishing fourth of the eight runners behind the British- trained outsider John de Coombe, Bilal and Kenmare. On 9 October at Longchamp, Super Concorde started 3.4/1 second favourite for the Grand Crit√©rium against a field which included Bilal, Kenmare, Jaazeiro, John de Coombe, Pyjama Hunt, Little Love and Acamas. The Boutin stable also ran Crazy Dmitri as a pacemaker in order to ensure a true test of stamina over the 1600m course. Super Concorde settled behind the leaders, took the lead 400m from the finish and won by three-quarters of a length and a neck from Pyjama Hunt and Acamas. =1978: three-year-old season= Super Concorde was difficult to train as a three-year-old and ran only three times. On 16 April he started odds-on favourite for the Prix de Guiche at Longchamp but finished fifth of the six runners behind Gay Mecene. He did not reappear until late June when he was matched against older horses in the Group One Prix d'Ispahan. He produced his best effort of the season to finish fourth behind the four-year-olds Carwhite, Trillion and Gairloch, with Kenmare, Roland Gardens and Enstone Spark among the beaten horses. On his final start he finished sixth of the nine runners in the Eclipse Stakes, appearing unsuited by the firm ground. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1977: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. Super Concorde topped the French handicap, two pounds ahead of Pyjama Hunt and Acamas. The independent Timeform organisation awarded him a rating of 128, two pounds below the Irish-trained Try My Best. In the following year, he was rated 123 by Timeform, fifteen pounds below their top-rated horse Alleged. In the International Classification for three-year-olds he was rated thirteen pounds below the top-rated Ile de Bourbon. Stud record On his retirement from racing Super Concorde was bought back by Nelson Bunker Hunt and became a breeding stallion at Gainesway Farm in Kentucky, beginning his stud career at a fee of $20,000. He was not a particularly successful stallion, but sired some good winners including Martha Stevens (Nell Gwyn Stakes), Big Shuffle (Cork and Orrery Stakes, leading sire in Germany), Super May (Mervyn Leroy Handicap), Over the Ocean (Prix Perth), Concorde Bound (Suffolk Downs Sprint Handicap) and Croeso (Florida Derby). Super Concorde died in 1987.

If R is a commutative Noetherian ring of Krull dimension d, then the stable range of R is at most d + 1 (a theorem of Bass). Bass stable range The Bass stable range condition SRm refers to precisely the same notion, but for historical reasons it is indexed differently: a ring R satisfies SRm if for any v1, ... , vm in R generating the unit ideal there exist t2, ... , tm in R such that vi - v1ti for 2 ‚â§ i ‚â§ m generate the unit ideal. Comparing with the above definition, a ring with stable range n satisfies SRn+1. In particular, Bass's theorem states that a commutative Noetherian ring of Krull dimension d satisfies SRd+2. (For this reason, one often finds hypotheses phrased as \\"Suppose that R satisfies Bass's stable range condition SRd+2...\\") Stable range relative to an ideal Less commonly, one has the notion of the stable range of an ideal I in a ring R. The stable range of the pair (R,I) is the smallest integer n such that for any elements v0, ... , vn in R that generate the unit ideal and satisfy vn 1 mod I and vi 0 mod I for 0 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n-1, there exist t1, ... , tn in R such that vi - v0ti for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n also generate the unit ideal. As above, in this case we say that (R,I) satisfies the Bass stable range condition SRn+1. By definition, the stable range of (R,I) is always less than or equal to the stable range of R.

History Syndell Studio was founded in 1954 by Walter Hopps and Jim Newman, with Michael Scoles, poet Ben Bartosh and his wife Betty Brunt. It was located at 11756 Gorham Avenue, Brentwood, in a (no longer extant) building constructed from used pier pilings and remnants from a demolished Santa Monica beach club. According to oral history interviews with Hopps, Newman, and artist Edward Kienholz, the gallery was named after Maurice Sindel, a Midwestern farmer who died on the highway in Ohio on 6 June 1953. The accident was witnessed by Newman as he drove from Oberlin to Los Angeles. Hopps stated, \\"It's just too absurd, that this man dies in obscurity. We're going to make him an artist. We're going to create work for him. We're going to put him in group shows. We're going to name our place after him, as though it had been his studio\\". The gallery's business cards were created by poet and printmaker Robert Alexander. Alexander and Wallace Berman designed invitations to exhibitions.

On December 25, 1917, Sears and his mother reached Saskatoon where they were later reunited with his father. After completing his schooling, Sears began working at a bakery, where he became a member of a union. Joining the bakery's union was the beginning of his involvement in the labour movements of Saskatoon. In 1927, he married Mary Dubets with whom he had four sons. Sears was employed with Federated Co-op from 1944 until his retirement in 1967; he became regional warehouse manager in 1949. He also served as the second president of the Saskatoon board of the Canadian Congress of Labour. He married his second wife Phyllis after the death of Mary. Sears was a member of Saskatoon city council from 1951 to 1958 and again from 1964 to 1971.

Manasherov finished eighth in the 74-kg division at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Cr√©teil, France, and later represented his nation Israel at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He also trained as a member of the wrestling team for Hapoel Rehovot Sports Club under his personal coach Leva Zimkin. Coming from one of the most prestigious wrestling families in the former Soviet Union, Manasherov competed along with his cousin, three-time Olympian, and 2003 world champion Gocha Tsitsiashvili in numerous global tournaments. Manasherov qualified for the Israeli squad in the men's 74 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by receiving a berth and rounding out the top eight spots from the World Championships. Manasherov suffered through a vulnerable game plan, as he lost his opening match 8‚Äì0 to Kazakhstan's Danil Khalimov, and was haplessly pinned by Spain's Jos√© Alberto Recuero in his second bout within a span of two minutes. Finishing last in the prelim pool and nineteenth overall in the final standings, Manasherov failed to advance further into the quarterfinals.

Early years Fran√ßois Souchon was born in Alais, Gard, in 1787. In 1809 he went to Paris to study painting. His father gave him a very small allowance while he was studying. He became a pupil of Jacques-Louis David, the famous painter of historical scenes. Through the influence of M. De Lascour he was able to find work in the houses of several leading personages teaching art to their children. These included Lafayette, Maubourg and Lasteyrie, and Lasteyrie's son-in-law the Antoine Destutt de Tracy. Later he taught in the houses of the Duke of Rovigo, the Prince of San Carlo and Marshall S√©bastiani. Paris after the Restoration After the Hundred Days for some time Souchon lost the employment he had enjoyed with the leading families of the First French Empire, but soon after the second Bourbon Restoration he began to find new employment. Through their influence he was commissioned to paint a portrait of King Louis XVIII of France, which was given by the state to the municipality of Alais where it was hung in the council room. After the coronation of Charles X of France on 29 May 1825 he was one of the artists commissioned to paint large scenes of episodes in the ceremony, in his case the repas royal. The king, princes and nobles who appeared in the picture all visited his studio to pose for their portraits in the painting. Souchon was commissioned by the state to paint various other large works in the years that followed, such as a Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, , in 1824 and a Resurrection of Lazarus, in 1827. Several paintings were exhibited in the Salon de Paris. He was a close friend of Xavier Sigalon, who also came to Paris from the Nord department. In 1833 he agreed to assist Sigalon in a huge task that had been assigned by Thiers, to go to Rome to make a copy of Michelangelo's fresco of The Last Judgement for a room in the Palais des beaux-arts. There was a dispute between the two artists, and Souchon returned to Paris. In 1837 he was in his studio on the rue des Orf√®vres working on three tableaux of episodes in the life of Joan of Arc, la Vocation, la Victoire and Martyre. Lille Souchon was invited to move to Lille in 1838, to direct the newly founded school of painting there. He was named professor and director of the school on 21 August 1838, a position that came with a good salary and a studio furnished by the city. Soon after arriving he made four tableaux for the church of Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ces in Loos, Nord, and several portraits including one of M. Du Bosquiel, mayor of Bondues. Fran√ßois Souchon died on 5 April 1857 in Lille. His portrait, painted by Alphonse Colas in 1851, hangs in the Mus√©e des Beaux- Arts de Lille. Pupils Some of Souchon's pupils and friends during his Paris years included Narcisse Virgilio D√≠az, Honor√© Daumier and Philippe Auguste Jeanron. One of Souchon's pupils in 1833 was Hyacinthe Besson, who accompanied Souchon to Rome. Auguste-Joseph Herlin studied under Souchon in Lille in 1840‚Äì48. Carolus-Duran (1837‚Äì1917) studied drawing at the Lille academy under the sculptor Augustin-Phidias Cadet de Beaupr√©, and by the age of fifteen had become an apprentice of Souchon, before moving to Paris in 1853. Alphonse Colas was a pupil of Souchon, and became director of the school of painting in Lille in 1855, shortly before Souchon died.

In 1951 he was one of the objectors to the proposal of the new Labour majority council to relieve High Street congestion by putting a new road through Riddiford Park, linking Barraud Street (then a cul-de-sac) to Kings Crescent. The alternative was a road alongside the stopbank which the City Engineer said was too expensive and of dubious value. The Barraud Street extension (now Queen's Drive) required moving forty houses from north of Laings Road, and according to Gregory: \\"Riddiford Park was one of the most beautiful spots in New Zealand, and its whole character would change if a road was put through it\\" Five councillors voted against the road, but it went through after an empowering act was passed by Parliament.

When the first Government Resident Maurice Charles O'Connell came to Gladstone (then known as Port Curtis), he had a house built in 1856 called Toolooa House at Barney Point. This house was sold on 12 September 1863 and burned down on 15 August 1873. The name Toolooa was later used for a railway station south of Gladstone, but this station no longer exists. In 1900 the Bundaberg firm Messrs H. A. Skyring and Sons established a large sawmill in the area near the railway line. It employed many workers and contributed to Gladstone's growth. The mill was completely destroyed by fire on 4 April 1930. Skyring's Siding Provisional School opened about 2 May 1905 but was soon renamed Toolooa Provisional School. It was upgraded to Toolooa State School on 1 Jan 1909 but closed on 30 April 1921. Toolooa State High School opened on 27 January 1981 with 200 Year-8 students and 11 teachers. In the , Toolooa had a population of 1,164 people. Geography Toolooa is south of Gladstone Central. Toolooa borders Telina, South Gladstone, and Glen Eden and is close to The Botanical Gardens. Glenlyon Road is the western boundary of the suburb and by the railway line to the north and east. Gladstone-Benaraby Road passes through the eastern part of the suburb. Education Toolooa State High School is a government co-educational secondary (7-12) school located in Philip Street.(). In 2013, the school had 839 students with 66 teachers (63 full-time equivalent). There are no primary schools in Toolooa but these are available in nearby suburbs such as South Gladstone and Kin Kora.

While all women have been disadvantaged, black women have dealt with additional struggles due to apartheid. Legal systems have played a large part in the systematic oppression of South African women. In addition, South Africa struggles with extremely high rates of rape and sexual violence.  History  = Discrimination and race =  Black women  Before the most recent Bill of Rights was adopted, the struggle of the women of South Africa started as early as 1913, when black women began to protest against having to carry identification passes (white women did not have to carry the passes). In 1918, Charlotte Maxeke started the first formal women's organization, called the Bantu Women's LeagueAfrican_National_Congress_Women%27s_League. Charlotte Maxeke was the first black woman to receive a degree from Wilberforce Universityhttps://wilberforce.edu/. Nontsizi Mgqwetho also contributed to the advancement of women's rights in the 1920s with her writings and poetry mirroring the critiques presented by MaxekeCharlotte_Maxeke. Both women contributed to the black press. They argued the need to rupture the idea of black women's publicness. The domestic setting was seen as the women's realm and outside of the house was seen as the man's realm. However, the contributions of black women were not seen as intellectual insights. With Maxeke's political and educational experience and class position, and Mgqwetho's closeness to the press, they were able to make their opinions public, which would have been very difficult at this time. They were speaking in a society where all blacks were not considered worthy to be citizens. On top of that, they also fought the SANNC- the party for black men which excluded black women members. Charlotte Maxeke, leader of the Bantu's Women League In the 1930s and 1940s there were many mass protests, demonstrations and resistance campaigns in which women participated. Before 1943 the African National Congress (ANC) was an organization founded by men and only admitted men. The struggles of women from 1913-1943 showed that women were affected by colonialism as well. In 1943, the ANC opened its doors for women to join. In 1948, the ANC Women's League (ANCWL) was formed and Ida Mntwana became the first female president of the League. In 1952, many South African black women took part in the Defiance Campaign, which involved purposefully breaking apartheid laws. The Congress Alliance asked the ANCWL to assist in the making of the 1955 Congress of the People. There, the Freedom Charter was created and allowed women to express their needs and incorporate their requests. However, in 1955 the pass laws were presented again. Demonstrations were held in protest of these laws. On August 9, 1956, thousands of women marched to the Union Buildings in protest. The march was planned by the Federation of South African Women. On this day, South African women celebrated the first South African Women's Freedom day. The holiday was organized by the ANC to commemorate the protests that began on August 9, 1913, against the identification passes that black people had to carry. The ANC was banned in 1960 and halted the progress and demonstrations women were having. Other regional organizations were formed, since many women went into exile and those who remained were unable to organize anything. Once the ANC was unbanned in 1990, the ANCWL brought all the organizations together to form the National Women's Coalition in 1991. The Women's charter was completed in 1994 and the concerns were incorporated into the new Bill of Rights.  Bill of Rights  It was not until the introduction of the Constitution of South Africa in 1996 that all women in South Africa were formally recognized as equal citizens. In this Constitution, there was a special paragraph for women, titled ‚ÄòEquality‚Äô. In this Bill of Rights, sections 9, 10, 11, 12 specifically refer to women as equals and the basis of how to be treated. Section 9(3) prohibits any form of discrimination with relation to gender, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy, ethnicity or culture. This is followed by sections 10 and 11 which give the right to be treated equally and the right to life. One of the most significant sections is 12, which states the right ‚Äòto be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources.‚Äô As domestic violence has been an issue for all women, this establishes that within the domain of a home or family they are under public policy as well.  Rights of girls in South Africa  Nowadays 96% of South African children aged 7‚Äì13 receive a primary education. However, there was a time when it was unusual to be able to go to school there. Many children struggled to receive an education. The government schools struggle with many challenges including a poor quality of education, low teacher morale, the impact of HIV and AIDS, poor infrastructure, water shortages, food insecurity, poor public health, and few techniques for inclusive education, particularly for children with disabilities. Girls and young women still report high levels of sexual abuse, intimidation, exploitation and murder in their schools. It has been reported that children aged 10‚Äì14 are most commonly raped and their school teachers are the most common child rapist. Many girls are forced to leave schools either for pregnancies or as a result of the harassment. Due to the treatment of young girls in the educational system, women are limited to their social and economic potential. This also causes the increase of the spread of HIV to younger girls and has resulted in unsafe sexual practices later in life. Girls are socialized to become home keepers and child-bearers, so they place less value on their educational. When girls perform well in subjects such as math or science, they are not encouraged and they mostly do not have the confidence to pursue careers that rely on these skills. Many schools are not child or girl friendly. Some are situated far from homes, exposing girls to danger when they walk to and from school. Nearly a million children under the age of 15 have been orphaned as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Girls often drop out of school to look after sick family members and younger siblings. In 2003, the South African Minister of Education set up the Girls‚Äô Education Movement (GEM). GEM is an African movement, supported by UNICEF, where children and young people in schools and communities in South Africa work to bring positive changes in the lives of African girls and boys. GEM aims to: * Give girls equal access to education * Improve the quality of education, especially in disadvantaged schools * Make the school program and school books gender responsive * Create schools that are safe and secure for children, especially girls * Work with boys as strategic partners * Decrease gender-based violence * Abolish harmful cultural * practices such as early marriage. GEM has had a lot of success in this area and has also helped many schools, making life for a large number of girls a lot better. There are a lot of other organizations that try to get more fair rights for the girls in South Africa.  During the wars  The Boer Wars were two wars fought during 1880‚Äì1881 and 1899‚Äì1902 by the British Empire against two independent Boer republics, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic. ( ‚ÄòBoer‚Äô is the Dutch and African word for farmer.) Boer women, children and men that were not fit enough to work for the British were put together in concentration camps during the Boer War 2. The first two of these camps were established to house the families of cities who had surrendered voluntarily, but very soon, families that were a burden for the British were driven forcibly into camps that were established all over the country, the camps first stayed refugee camps but they later became concentration camps. The horrible conditions in these camps caused the death of 4,177 women, 22,074 children under sixteen and 1,676 men, mainly those too old to be on commando. The white and the black people were put in different camps. 14,154 deaths were officially recorded in the black section of these camps. It is estimated that 25,000 to 34,000 deaths occurred in the Boer camps, with 81% being death of children. These statistics, however, do not include the number of deaths which happened en route to the camps and during the capturing. The initial investigation of these camps started because of the white child mortality. The role of children was very important during this war and the race and class affected the experience of each child. Children were often separated from their families and exposed to harsh conditions and diseases. Their health going into the camps was already deteriorating and significantly declined upon arrival. The conditions were inhumane and families and children were crammed together. Such trauma also involved the separation with parents and not recognizing the faces when they came to return their children home. Black children also were forced to work in Boer camps. Children did earn a little money for work as it was considered contribution to their families. In Bloemfontein, the National Women's Monument was built in memorial of the conflict and dedicated to the women and children. All women and children were put in concentration camps right away, they were treated very badly. The white camps had it much better than the black camps. Field-Marshal Lord Roberts had another motive to put Blacks into camps, namely to make them work, either to grow crops for the troops or to dig trenches, be wagon drivers or work as miners. They did not receive food, hardly any medical support or shelter and were expected to grow their own crops. The strong-bodied who could work, could exchange labour for food or buy a meal for a cheap price. On January 22, 1901, the Boschhoek concentration camp for Blacks had about 1,700 black hold a protest meeting. They state that when they were brought into the camps, they had been promised that they will be paid for all their stock taken by the British. They are also unhappy because \\"... they receive no food while the Boers who are the cause of the war are fed for free in the refugee camps‚Ä¶‚Äù While the war lasted, more and more concentration camps were set up for women and children, and more and more deaths were recorded.  What has been done for the women in South Africa  Many things have been done for women in South Africa. Take for example the commemoration of the Women's March that is held every year. But even things as the Bill of Rights have had great impact on the women in South Africa. Though many things have been done for the women in South Africa, they still are treated lesser than men but also lesser than white women. Even as this has not improved, these things have had a positive effect on how women are treated around that area. In this way think about how little girls can now have an education without having to be afraid of going to school. But not only the direct causes, also think about projects in which things against AIDS are done. By helping to do things against this disease, organizations are making sure that the children ‚Äì girls and boys ‚Äì get a chance to actually try to get a normal life. Because some of them are born with this disease. Here are many organizations that work on women's issues. During the negotiations, an organization called the Women's National Coalition worked very hard throughout the country collecting women's views on the country they would like to see. This culminated in women from different political parties becoming part of the political negotiations in South Africa. It also led to the development of the National Gender Policy Framework and the establishment of the (initially) Office of the Status of Women, now the Women's Ministry and the Commission for Gender Equality. The big organization that was formed in 2006 to accommodate women from all political organs and walks of life is the Progressive Women's Movement of South Africa (PWMSA).http://www.anc.org.za/content/progressive-womens-movement-south- africa-base-document One of the small organizations is Woman's Net, a feminist organization that especially tries to fight for the equality of women in South Africa. Women also organize themselves in political parties, business organizations, academic institutions, trade union and other structures. Another huge issue in South Africa is the trafficking of women and pseudo- cultural practices that allow child marriages. These arranged marriages have destroyed the lives of many girls. This has changed in 2016 with the amendment of the trafficking legislation to include criminalization of the \\"ukuthwala\\" practice which had been bastardised over time. There are many pieces of legislation that have been introduced to promote the protection of women in the rural settings and those married through traditional customs; to protect women from domestic violence, to protect women from rape and ensure their rights in political, social and economic settings. The challenges remain the publicization of these and the education of all the citizens about the constitution and the progressive legislation.http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/womens-rights-and- representation = Current events = There continue to be many efforts made for women to gain more rights and fighting against the violence that persists in society. In September 2019, women took to the streets for three days fighting against the national crisis of violence against women and children. Although President Cyril Ramaphosa assured the women that the laws would be reviewed, they were not satisfied. Some women have asked for the death penalty to be established for those who use violence against women and children. The fight continues to persist in South African society as women continue to be mistreated and violated.

Upon Eve's arrival back to Salem, Paige's relationship with J.J. begins to hit a hard spot, ultimately ending with them parting ways multiples times. She becomes close to another guy, Cole Hines (Riley Bodenstab) and asks him out on a date, which he accepts. After their date, Paige meets up with J.J. at the park, where he apologizes profusely and asks for a second chance. She forgives him, leading them to reconcile. Cole finds her at the park watching Parker play and tells her that J.J. will hurt her and that she deserves better, but when he sees that she's not listening to him, he leaves. He then works with her mother Eve to break J.J. and Paige up. Cole plants drugs in J.J.'s backpack to frame him. When Paige realizes what Cole has done, she angrily confronts him.

Paige is pronounced dead, much to the horror of J.J. and Eve who apologizes to Paige over her body. Chad DiMera is seen as the prime suspect, due to the fact that a flower found near the crime scene can only be found at the DiMera mansion; following the arrest of Chad, he was released after Aiden Jennings was believed to be the Neck Tie Killer.

The car, known as the Kaditcha K583 was the first closed top Sports Car seen in Australia and incorporated full ground effects aerodynamics.

A Rod Nash Racing VX Commodore was leased for the first few rounds, until a TWR VX became available and was purchased. At the end of 2002 the Level 1 franchise was sold to Team Dynamik and a Level 2 franchise purchased from McDougall Motorsport. Romano raced at the Adelaide 500 in 2003, with the franchise then leased out on occasions to other teams in 2004 including Paul Morris Motorsport and Walden Motorsport. In 2005 it was leased to Perkins Engineering.

It is currently owned by British Land. The retail destination opened in July 1988 following years of development by the London Docklands Development Corporation in the London Docklands and surrounding areas. Surrey Quays Shopping has over 40 stores including Tesco, 1,300 parking spaces and a food court. Improvements in the local transport links and rise in local housing developments in recent years have given local consumers easier access to the retail area. British Land plan to redevelop it over the next few years, adding retail space, extensions and a number of new dwellings. History The site on which the destination is built was originally a dock. However, as the majority of Surrey Docks ship yards closed in the early 1970s, due to a general decline, the land was left abandoned and the docks filled in. It was not until the London Docklands Development Corporation began to redevelop the area that the land found a new lease of life. See Surrey Commercial Docks Construction of Surrey Quays Shopping began in late 1985, and was completed in time for a July 1988 opening. At the same time new housing was being constructed in the surrounding area which ensured a steady influx of customers. The area is still referred to as Surrey Docks by many of the local residents and the old name can still be seen on a few road signs in the area. In 1998 a leisure park was opened adjacent to the area, facilities include an Odeon (UCI at the time) Cinema, Hollywood Bowl, and a number of restaurants. Present day The dolphin sculpture and fountain prior to removal. Main concourse area. Surrey Quays Shopping has not changed much from its original construction. An extension was added to the Tesco store in 2008, and a fountain which used to lie in the main concourse of the area featuring a Dolphin sculpture by David Backhouse was removed in the early 2000s to make way for a new seating and sale area. Transport Surrey Quays Shopping is in close proximity to Canada Water Underground station which serves the Jubilee line and London Overground's East London Line. Canada Water also has a bus station which allows access to a number of London bus routes. It has its own bus stops and most local bus routes stop here either before or after serving Canada Water. Surrey Quays Station is also close by which serves London Overground's East London Line. The shopping area has a mini cab rank and a large car park. Redevelopment An impression of what the retail area may look like once extensions are completed. - 2012 Design In 2013, British Land bought out Tesco's 50% stake in Surrey Quays. (It was originally owned by British Land and Tesco) British Land in a joint venture with Tesco (Surrey Quays Limited) plans to redevelop it over the next few years. The plan is to have a 100,000 sq ft extension built, while the existing infrastructure will undergo a major refurbishment. The surrounding area and its facade will also be significantly improved, including new public spaces, easy routes to transport links and larger parking areas. The nearby leisure park will also be included in these works as will the shop fronts along the river featuring the Decathlon stores. Commencement of these works is due to start in the near future. Planning permission has been granted by Southwark Council for the initial phase with further plans currently being reviewed.

Both universities are founding members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and are currently members of the SEC West with a total of 113 meetings. This rivalry is LSU's longest and Mississippi State's second behind the Egg Bowl against the University of Mississippi. LSU leads the series 75‚Äì36‚Äì3.  History  From 1923 to 1930, every game was played in the state of Mississippi, and LSU hosted every game from 1934 to 1957, and only four games in the series were played outside of Baton Rouge from 1934 to 1973.The Knights Who Say, Bayou Blogger Relocated. Retrieved June 21, 2014. When the SEC expanded in 1992, the matchup with LSU and Mississippi State was not played in November like it had since 1947 and has only been played once in the month of November since. LSU has dominated most of the series since 1985 losing only six games with the most current loss in 2020, when the then-unranked Bulldogs defeated #6 LSU in Baton Rouge, 44-34.  Notable Games  *1991: William \\"Sleepy\\" Robinson led Mississippi State to a 28-19 victory in Tiger Stadium. LSU's Todd Kinchen had a then-school record 248 receiving yards in the loss. *1999: The #7 Bulldogs gutted out a 17-16 win over the Tigers at Scott Field. Rod Gibson the clinching touchdown in closing minutes. *2000: After falling behind 31-17, the Tigers rallied to beat the Bulldogs 45-38 in overtime. *2009: Mississippi State outgained the Tigers by over 100 yards and drove down to the 1 yard line in the final minute, but a goal-line stand by LSU preserved the lead for a 30-26 Tiger win. *2014: Dak Prescott led the then-unranked Bulldogs to a 34-29 upset in Baton Rouge, snapping the Tigers' 14-game win streak in the series. The Bulldogs actually led 34-10 in the fourth quarter, but LSU scored 3 late touchdowns to almost close the gap, but the Tigers' Hail Mary on the final play was intercepted by Will Redmond. Josh Robinson ran for 197 yards for the Bulldogs. This was the Bulldogs' first win over LSU since 1999, and their first on the road in Baton Rouge since 1991. Mississippi State reached #1 in the rankings a few weeks later, and finished 10-3 on the season. *2017: LSU came into Starkville ranked #12 under first-year head coach Ed Orgeron, but it was the unranked Bulldogs who won in a 37-7 rout. Nick Fitzgerald threw two touchdown passes and ran in two more, and the Bulldogs outgained the Tigers 465-270. It was also the first win over LSU at home in Starkville for the Bulldogs since 1999 and the first time they beat a ranked LSU team there since 1984. *2020: Mike Leach in his coaching debut pulled one of the more memorable upsets in recent school history. Mississippi State came into the game as an 18-point underdog against defending national champion LSU. Instead, the Bulldogs upset the Tigers in Death Valley, 44‚Äì34. Mississippi State QB K. J. Costello threw for an SEC and school record 623 yards. LSU was no slouch, as QB Myles Brennan threw for 325 yards and 3 TDs. The Tigers had their 16-game win streak snapped and became the first defending champions to lose a season opener since Michigan in 1998.

It is capable of teaching itself about any visual concept without any human supervision during the operation. LEVAN learns which terms are relevant by analyzing the content of the images found on the Web and identifying characteristic patterns across them using recognition algorithms. The funds for the research on LEVAN was provided by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the National Science Foundation. It was initially rolled out in March and as of 21 June 2014, users can browse a library of about 175 concepts with it.  Operation  LEVAN works by associating the textual data with visual data. After providing it with a textual entry, the programme then searches through numerous books and images and identifies every possible variations of the concept and displays the results as a detailed list of images that have uniformity in appearance. The research team proposed two main approaches, called axes. The \\"everything\\" axis corresponds to every possible appearance variations of a concept, while the \\"anything\\" axis corresponds to the span of different concepts for which visual models are to be learned. A different algorithm is responsible for refining words that do not correspond to the visual data. As of June 2014, the system has been working as an archive.  Future plans  In future, the developers of the program intend to release it as an open source program, and eventually offer a smartphone app, to be available for educational purposes and facilitate an information bank to assist researchers in the computer vision community. The phone app will be aimed at quick categorising and tagging of images for archiving.

The species has a wide tolerance to various growth conditions, surviving temperatures between 5-29 ¬∞C, salinities from freshwater to complete saturation, and grows well under various light intensities. The species growth rate responds to increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen availability, making the species a possible indicator of anthropogenic pollution leading to eutrophication. Identification The thalli of Ulvaria obscura are bladelike, usually less than 5 cm tall and 8 cm thick, consisting of a single cell layer, and typically have between 2 and 6 pyrenoids per cell.

It was finished in 2000 and is amongst Golijov's most well known compositions. It is famous for combining several Latin and African musical styles.  Composition  The work was commissioned by Helmuth Rilling, from the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart in 1996 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach. It was initially conceived to pay homage to Bach's St Matthew Passion, as part of a project called Passion 2000, in which Wolfgang Rihm, Sofia Gubaidulina, and Tan Dun also took part. All of the composers were asked to write their own version of the Passion, as long as they used the text. At first, Golijov refused to take part in the project, because the Passion was meant to be a Christian composition, while Golijov himself was Jewish. Even though he was commissioned the composition in 1996, he started composing it two years later, while he studied the New Testament and the Catholic tradition. When Golijov presented the composition in rehearsals, Rilling himself asked him if \\"it was a Passion\\", for he was very surprised about the result. The premiere took place in Stuttgart's in September 5, 2000. For that performance, Mar√≠a Guinand conducted the Orquesta La Pasi√≥n and the Schola Cantorum de Venezuela, Luciana Souza and Reynaldo Fern√°ndez had the role of Afro-Cuban vocalist, while Samia Ibrahim played the soprano. It was greeted with a 25-minute standing ovation. The US premiere took place in Symphony Hall, Boston, and had the same performers except for the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Robert Spano. It was dedicated to Mar√≠a Guinand and the Schola Cantorum de Venezuela, and was published by Boosey & Hawkes in 2006.  Structure  The composition is in two parts and takes approximately 87 minutes to perform. It is divided into 34 movements, even though movements 11 and 12 are joined together. The complete movement list is as follows: * Part I * Part II Like Bernstein's Mass, this composition is primarily meant to be performed on stage. It is scored for a choir of minimum 54 voices, out of which 8 must be soloists as well; a very large percussion section, which should consist of a berimbau, caxixi, bongos, guataca, ok√≥nkolo, maracas, congas, shekere, it√≥tele, bombo leg√ºero, bass drum, timpani, bell, guiro, gua gua, cuica, quinto, surdo cortador, surdo resposta, surdo marca√ßao, repnique, chimes, wind chimes, tamtam, tambourine, sea shells, spring drum, iy√†, and cymbal; the rest of the Orquesta La Pasi√≥n, consisting of a guitar, a tres, an accordion, a piano, a caj√≥n, a contrabass, and sound effects; finally, a last section which should consist of two trumpets in C, two trombones, 12 violins, 12 cellos, and 4 basses. A dancer is also required for performance, especially in instrumental sections. All movements are joined by an attacca, except for movements 2 to 3, and 26 to 27. The score also has frequent stage indications for performers and a guide on how the sound system should be set up. The texts are extracted from Mark's Gospel, the Kaddish, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Psalms 113-119, and texts by Galician author Rosal√≠a de Castro.  Critical reception  Even though the audience was shocked for the innovative character of the composition, it was very well received by public and critics, with a 25-minute standing ovation in the premiere. The New York Times and The Boston Globe called it \\"a work of genius\\". The latter also added that \\"the Pasi√≥n will stand as the first indisputably great composition of the 21st century.\\" Alex Ross, from The New Yorker, said about the piece: \\"It drops like a bomb on the belief that classical music is an exclusively European art.\\"  Arrangements  * In 2010, Gonzalo Grau, 2011 recipient of the European Composers‚Äô Prize of the city of Berlin and close friend of Golijov, composed an arrangement suite in six movements for two pianos and orchestra, entitled Nazareno. It was commissioned by Katia Lab√®que, Marielle Lab√®que and the Orchestre de Paris and sponsored by the Orquesta de Castilla y Le√≥n.  Recordings  Only two recordings of the Passion have been released to date: * A 2001 recording by H√§nssler performed by Mar√≠a Guinand, Orquesta La Pasi√≥n, and Schola Cantorum de Venezuela. * A 2010 recording by Deutsche Grammophon performed by Mar√≠a Guinand, Orquesta La Pasi√≥n, and Schola Cantorum de Venezuela.

The kidnappings took place in three different phases: before the May 1997 Indonesian legislative elections, two months before the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) session in March 1998 and in the period just before Soeharto's 21 May resignation. None of those abducted during the first and third period have reappeared. Some of the activists who were abducted in the second period have openly spoken about their experiences.Laporan Praktek HAK ASASI MANUSIA 1998 untuk Indonesia Background =New Order= The New Order () is the term coined by the second Indonesian President Suharto to characterize his regime as he came to power in 1966. Suharto used this term to contrast his rule with that of his predecessor, Sukarno (dubbed the \\"Old Order,\\" or Orde Lama). The term \\"New Order\\" in more recent times has become synonymous with the Suharto years (1965‚Äì1998). Immediately following the attempted coup in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the Suharto's New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia's problems since its independence. The 'generation of 66' (Angkatan 66) epitomized talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following Indonesia's communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, the \\"New Order\\" was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the \\"New Order\\" established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratization and corporatization of political and societal organizations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. Strident anti-communism remained a hallmark of the regime for its subsequent 32 years. Within a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro- democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the 1998 Indonesian Revolution and then gained power, the term \\"New Order\\" has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the Suharto period, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian regime, such as corruption, collusion and nepotism (widely known by the acronym KKN: korupsi, kolusi, nepotisme). =Pro-democracy movement= University students and police forces clash in May 1998. In 1996 Suharto undertook efforts to pre-empt a challenge to the New Order government. The Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), a legal party that had traditionally propped up the regime had changed direction, and began to assert its independence. Suharto fostered a split over the leadership of PDI, backing a co-opted faction loyal to deputy speaker of the People's Representative Council Suryadi against a faction loyal to Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Sukarno and the PDI's chairperson. After the Suryadi faction announced a party congress to sack Megawati would be held in Medan on June 20‚Äì22, Megawati proclaimed that her supporters would hold demonstrations in protest. The Suryadi faction went through with its sacking of Megawati, and the demonstrations manifested themselves throughout Indonesia. This led to several confrontations on the streets between protesters and security forces, and recriminations over the violence. The protests culminated in the military allowing Megawati's supporters to take over PDI headquarters in Jakarta, with a pledge of no further demonstrations. Suharto allowed the occupation of PDI headquarters to go on for almost a month, as attentions were also on Jakarta due to a set of high-profile ASEAN meetings scheduled to take place there. Capitalizing on this, Megawati supporters organized \\"democracy forums\\" with several speakers at the site. On July 26, officers of the military, Suryadi, and Suharto openly aired their disgust with the forums. On July 27, police, soldiers, and people claiming to be Suryadi supporters stormed the headquarters. Several Megawati supporters were killed, and over two-hundred arrested and tried under the Anti-Subversion and Hate-Spreading laws. The day would become known as \\"Black Saturday\\" and mark the beginning of a renewed crackdown by the New Order government against supporters of democracy, now called the \\"Reformasi\\" or Reformation.Amnesty International, 1996 Kidnappings The 1997/1998 activists kidnapping were abductions of pro- democracy activists which happened between the 1997 Indonesian Legislative Election and the fall of Suharto in 1998. The kidnappings took place in three different phases: before the May 1997 Indonesian legislative elections, two months before the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) session in March 1998 and in the period just before Soeharto's 21 May resignation. None of those abducted during the first and third period have reappeared. Some of the activists who were abducted in the second period have openly spoken about their experiences. Kingsbury explains that the activists were kidnapped \\"by members of Kopassus, then controlled by Prabowo, but sections of the army generally tolerated and in some cases even encouraged student protest\\".Damien Kinsbury (2003) Power Politics and the Indonesian Military. As an anonymous activist who was kidnapped and then released expressed, many of them were poisoned in an airless room after their detention. \\"Like in an underground room,\\" he uttered, adding he was constantly tortured during his imprisonment. \\"If I'm not mistaken, I was imprisoned for seven days. The kidnappings started in the early months of 1997, after the campaign for general election began and members of the PDIP disappeared, and continued until the May 1998 riots extending the forced disappearances to members of Indonesia Students Solidarity for Democracy. Kontras, the Indonesian Commission for \\"the Disappeared\\" and Victims of Violence, on its report \\"Progress Case Activists kidnapping in 1998\\" notes that \\"the kidnapping of Pius Lustrilanang, Desmond J Mahesa, Haryanto Taslam, Mugiyanto, Aan Rusdianto, Faisol Reza, Rahardja W Jati and Nezar Patria encouraged civil community movement to demand responsibility from the military which was considered the perpetrator\\". Some of the victims were released, but 13 are still missing. That is the case of Suyat, Yani Afri, Sonny, M.Yusuf, Noval Alkatiri, Dedy Hamdun, Ismail, Bimo Petrus, Abdun Naser, Hendra Hambali, Ucok Siahaan, Yadin Muhidin and Wiji Thukul. Darma Putra considers that this kidnappings had the goal of suppressing anti-government movements. As she notes, many of the activists who were later released have been afraid of revealing their experiences publicly because they still feel threatened. In the profile published on Kontras's website, :\\"The victims were not only political parties, but also nearly all independent and community-based organizations. NGOs and student movements experienced cooptation and intimidation through increasingly brutal investigations, arrests and detentions. Some were done through \\"official\\" channels while others were conducted secretly and arbitrarily. Victims During the period 1997/1998, KONTRAS (Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of Violence) reported that 23 people had been abducted by the state. Out of those 23 activists, one person was found dead (Leonardus Gilang), 9 released by their captors and 13 others are still missing to this day. The kidnappings occurred during the years when General Wiranto was the Defense Minister/Armed Forces Commander General. = Released activists = The nine activists who were released are: # Desmond Junaidi Mahesa, kidnapped at the Lembaga Bantuan Hukum Nusantara (Nusantara Legal Aid Institute), Jakarta, February 4, 1998. # Haryanto Taslam. # Rahardjo Walujo Djati, kidnapped at the RSCM (Hospital Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo) after a press conference at the Legal Aid Foundation KNPD, Jakarta, March 12, 1998. # Pius Lustrilanang, kidnapped in front of RSCM (Hospital Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo) after a press conference for the Legal Aid Institute in Jakarta, February 2, 1998 # Faisol Reza, kidnapped in RSCM after press conference in Jakarta, March 12, 1998 # Nezar Patria, kidnapped in the block of apartments Klender, March 13, 1998. # Aan Rusdianto, kidnapped in the block of apartmentents Klender, March 13, 1998. # Mugianto, kidnapped in the block of apartments Klender, March 13, 1998. # Andi Arief, kidnapped in Lampung, March 28, 1998. = Missing activists = The 13 activists who are still missing were members of various organizations, such as the People's Democratic Party or Partai Rakyat Demokratik, PDI Pro Mega, Mega Bintang, and students organisations: # Petrus Bimo Anugrah, Airlangga University student and member of STF Driyakara; disappeared in Jakarta on March 30, 1998. # Herman Hendrawan, Airlangga University student; disappeared after a press conference at the Legal Aid FoundationKNPD in Jakarta, March 12, 1998. # Suyat, SMID activist; disappeared in Solo on February 12, 1998. # Wiji Thukul, poet, activist from the organisation Jaker; disappeared in Jakarta on January 10, 1998. # Yani Afri, driver, supporter of Megawati's PDI Pro Mega.

Kopassus  Kopassus is an Indonesian Army special forces group that conducts special operations missions for the Indonesian government, such as direct action, unconventional warfare, sabotage, counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism, and intelligence gathering. Kopassus was founded on April 16, 1952. It gained worldwide attention after several successful operations such as Indonesian invasion of East Timor and hostage release of Garuda Indonesia Flight 206. The Special Forces have been a subject of controversy due to their role in the activists kidnappings in the period between 1997 and 1998. Mugiyanto, one of the activists who was kidnapped, as stated that the kidnapping and torture were carried out by the Indonesian special forces (Kopassus). Mugiyanto was kidnapped in Jakarta when he was going to meet other activists when he was kidnapped on March 13, 1998. He informed Vice News of what happened in an interview conducted in front of Kopassus headquarters in Jakarta. Mugiyanto was in Jakarta to meet with other pro-democracy activists to organize protests against the government when he was taken on March 13, 1998. VICE News caught up with him outside the Kopassus headquarters. The location has a special meaning, as he affirms that years after being kidnapped he realised that \\"it was the Kopassus headquarters that I had been taken to\\". He also states that \\"some activists were taken directly to Kopassus, but not in my case\\". This testimony proves the direct responsibility of the Special Forces in these events. According to the Federation of American Scientists, during the Officers' Honorary Council, on August 21, 1998, three senior officers from Kopassus, including the unit's former commander, Major General Prabowo Subianto, were questioned. As a consequence, the Armed forces chief General Wiranto admitted the involvement of Kopassus in the activists kidnappings. A year later, on April 6, 1999, \\"a military court found 11 members of Kopassus guilty and handed them jail terms of up to 22 months\\". According to an article published by The Jakarta Post on April 17, 2002 Kopassus members \\"have also been accused of taking part in the mass violence that occurred in East Timor after the historic independence ballot in the former Portuguese colony in September 1999\\". In his book \\"Power Politics and the Indonesian Military\\", Damien Kingsbury states that Kopassus has been identified with \\"the perpetration of state terror, including a wide range of covert anticivilian activities and related human rights abuses, and as having the strongest political orientation\\". On December 30, 2010, Jay Griffiths published in the article 'Indonesia's slow motion genocide', Griffits stated that \\"Although the US Leahy Law forbids funding to military units that violate human rights, Kopassus is now being supported by President Obama, under the guise of fighting terrorism. The Kopassus document gives the lie to that, showing their systematic targeting of civilians.\\" Team Mawar The Team Mawar is a small unit within the Kopassus Group IV, part of the Indonesian Army. This team is the alleged mastermind behind the pro-democracy activists kidnappings. These events took 11 members of the Team Mawar to the Military High Court (Mahmilti II) in April 1999. Bambang Kristiono (Commander of the Team Mawar) was sentenced to 22 months in jail and expelled from the army. The court also sentenced the Infantry Captain Fausani Syahrial (FS) Deputy Commander Multhazar, Infantry Captain Sulistiyo Budi Nugroho, Infantry Captain Julius Selvanus and Infantry Captain Budi Harto to 20 months in prison and discharged all of them from active service. However, years later Fausani Multhazar and Untung Budi Harto emerged as commanders of military districts in Central Java and the Maluku islands respectively. The officers appealed to the Supreme Court, whose verdict was never made public. At the same time, six other soldiers were sentenced to one year and four months in prison but they kept their positions in the army. They were Infantry Captain Dada Hendra Yuda, Infantry Captain Djaka Budi Utama and Infantry Captain Fauka Noor Farid. Sergeant Sunaryo, Sergeant Sigit Sugianto and Sergeant Sukadi were sentenced to 1 year in prison. According to the confession of Mayor Bambang Kristiono, Commander of the Team Mawar, during the Military Tribunal, the person who ordered the activist abductions was Colonel Chairawan, but he was never brought to trial so it can not be confirmed. An article published in 2007 by The South China Morning Post stated that \\"two members of the so-called Team Mawar have been promoted to important military posts\\". In the same article, Haris Azhar, from the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence, said that \\"the Team Mawar case was another example of the political establishment's reluctance to settle human rights abuses and pursue meaningful reform of the TNI\\". =Group IV= As mentioned before, Team Mawar is a small unit within the Kopassus Group IV, part of the Indonesian Army. KOPASSUS has expanded to five Groups, with Group IV specifically handling intelligence operations along with the KOPASSUS Joint Intelligence Unit [SGI]. This team is the alleged mastermind behind the pro-democracy activists kidnappings. Group IV comprises approximately 800 men who work with the Joint Intelligence Unit on interrogations and domestic clandestine operations. These operations include the majority of Kopassus' most controversial and politically problematic roles, such as 'deep cover' activities, agent running,assassinations,sabotage, intelligence, espionage and as agents provocateur. In particular, Group IV has focused on infiltrating what were deemed to be opposition groups, acting as agents provocateurs in order to legitimise official crackdowns. Kingsbury notes that members of Group IV can be identified for growing their hair long, dress in nonconformist civilian clothes, set up secret cells based on groups of five, and sometimes carry out assassinations and other acts of terror. Also, they do not salute superior officers when outside their base. This group is also known for recruiting criminals as auxiliaries. Aftermath In 1998, many of the victims' families started to organise in order to ask the government for answers about the kidnappings. For this purpose, they created the Indonesian Association of Families of the Disappeared (IKOHI), and held meetings, public campaigns and actions with institutions in Indonesia and abroad. Due to their petitions, the government decided to conduct an investigation through The strong demand from the victims and the public finally had the government through its Commander of TNI (state army) to form the Council of Military Ethical Office (Dewan Kehormatan Perwira) to carry out an investigation. The case was investigated by the National Commission on Human Rights under Law No. 26/2000 on Human Rights Court and the results were submitted to the Attorney General in 2006. The National Commission on Human Rights team was working on the cases of forced disappearance from October 1, 2005 until October 30, 2006. Abdul Hakim Garuda Nusantara (Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission in 2006) requested the Attorney General to use the results obtained through the Commission to establish a team of investigators, as they had obtained sufficient preliminary evidence to prove the existence of crimes against humanity. An assistant to the ad-hoc investigation team into the 1997‚Äì1998 disappearances, Lamria, said there a number of people out of the 13 activists that are still missing who are known to have been at the army's elite special forces Kopassus post located the Cijantung area of East Jakarta. They are Yani Afrie, Sony, Herman Hendrawan, Deddy Hamdun and Noval Alkatiri, who Faisol Riza and Pius Lustrilanang met before released. The Commission concluded that there was evidence of human rights violations in the forced disappearance of activists during 1997‚Äì1998. This conclusion is based on the testimonies of 58 victims and community members, 18 retired members of the Police and a retired military. On December 22, 2006 the Human Rights Commission asked the Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR-RI) to urge the President to deploy and mobilize all law enforcement officials to resolve the issue. The House Speaker Agung Laksono on February 7, 2007, also asked President Yudhoyono to order the Attorney General Abdul Rahman Saleh to conduct investigations and examinations based on the findings of the Commission to resolve the case. In an interview with the Argentinian newspaper Tiempo, Haris Ashar, director of Kontras, explained that \\"it was not easy, but we managed to take the case to justice. In the end they investigated it in 2005 and after investigations all the material was delivered to the Attorney General, as established by the Human Rights Court law\\". In the same interview, Ashar pointed out that he had the chance to talk to the Attorney General, who told him that \\"this is not a matter of legal technicalities, but political support is needed from the president and I do not have it\\". According to Ashar, this situation comes from the fact that the president's position is on the same level as the head of the military, the police, the intelligence corps and does not have the courage to control the security forces. 2014 Controversy Prabowo during the nomination ceremony for the 2014 presidential election in Lembah Hambalang, on March 17, 2012 After an article published by The Jakarta Post mentioning the possible responsibility of the presidential candidate Prabowo, he answered the newspaper with a letter stating that he had nothing to do with it. However, as explained by Kingsbury, in August 1998 Prabowo, who was then the commander of Kostrad, admitted his responsibility to a military investigation team. He confirmed that he had been responsible for a series of political kidnappings and disappearances, being later removed from his posts with and two other senior Kopassus officers. He was also dismissed from the army. As reported by The Jakarta Post on June 2014, the Veterans Association chairman Gen. Agum Gumelar stressed that Prabowo told him that \\"he was ordered by former president Soeharto to kidnap the activists\\". Another source which has noted the role of Prabowo in the kidnappings comes from WikiLeaks. According to one of the cables some of the activists who were kidnapped by forces under Prabowo's control in the 1990s endorsed him during his candidacy for vicepresident with Megawati. Another cable states that Prabowo had been implicated in serious human rights abuses that took place in Indonesia and East Timor. The same cable also highlighted his self-exile in Jordan and Germany for some years, before going back to Indonesia running for vicepresident. As a 2014 presidential candidate, Prabowo's past came under renewed scrutiny, with many organisations calling for him to step down. A coalition, which consisted of Imparsial, Kontras, the Setara Institute, and the Human Rights Working Group (HRWG), combined under the Civil Society Coalition Against Forgetting, visited the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) in Jakarta on May 7, 2014 to urge the commission to re- investigate Prabowo. A June 27, 2014 report indicated that an investigative journalist, Allan Nairn, had been threatened with arrest \\"for revealing the former general's role in human rights abuses.\\" 2020 Controversy In 25 September President‚ÄúJokowi‚Äù Widodo has appointed six military officers to strategic posts within the Defense Ministry, including two former members of the infamous Tim Mawar (Rose Team) of the Army‚Äôs Special Forces Kopassus, which was implicated in the notorious forced disappearances of activists in the late 1990s.https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/09/25/former-tim- mawar-members-appointed-to-prabowos- office.htmlhttps://en.tempo.co/read/1390203/amnesty-international-slams- decision-to-appoint-former-tim-mawar-into-govt See also * May 1998 riots of Indonesia * Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians References =Bibliography=  Category:1997 crimes in Indonesia Category:1998 crimes in Indonesia Indonesia ","title":"1997‚Äì98 activists kidnappings in Indonesia"},{"id":"43111357","text":"Vil√°gszabads√°g ('World Freedom') was a weekly newspaper published from Budapest, Hungary from 1897 to August 3, 1919.

He is the Northeast Scouting Director for the Detroit Tigers and was previously the head coach of UNC Asheville (1991‚Äì1994) and Hartford (1995‚Äì1997). Playing career Bretz played college baseball at Charlotte under head coach Gary Robinson from 1984‚Äì1987. During this stretch, the 49ers had two 30-win seasons and made two Sun Belt Tournaments. Bretz's teammates at Charlotte included future Major League umpire Fieldin Culbreth. Coaching career =UNC Asheville= Bretz began his coaching career as an assistant at UNC Asheville from 1988‚Äì1990. He was promoted to head coach for the 1991 season and held the position from 1991‚Äì1994. Under Bretz, Asheville finished 5th in the Big South Conference in 1991 and 1992, appearing in the Big South Tournament in both seasons. Its deepest tournament run came in 1991, when the team went 19-29. It started the tournament 3-0, with wins over #3 Winthrop, #2 Augusta, and #4 Davidson. In the championship round, however, it lost two games to top-seeded Coastal Carolina and finished as the tournament runner-up. In Bretz's final two seasons, 1993 and 1994, the Bulldogs did not qualify for the conference tournament. His overall record at Asheville was 73-114. The Bulldogs had a player named to the All-Big South Team in each of Bretz's seasons, and three players signed professional contracts during his tenure. Pitcher Marc Rosenbalm, who was named to the Big South's all- conference and all-tournament teams in 1991, signed a free agent contract with the Seattle Mariners following the season. Jamon Deal and Eugene Faircloth were both selected in the 1992 MLB Draft and played in the minor leagues. Bretz's coaching staffs at Asheville included Sammy Stewart, an ex-Major League pitcher attempting a comeback from cocaine addiction. Stewart served as a volunteer assistant coach in 1991. Bretz said of Stewart in a press interview: \\"I'd heard all about his drug and alcohol problems, but the guy just made a mistake. You could see in his face that he wanted to make a commitment. He's been a real inspiration to my kids.\\" =Hartford= Prior to the start of the 1995 season, Bretz was hired as the head coach of Hartford, a position he held from 1995‚Äì1997. Hartford athletic director Pat Meiser-McKnett said of the hire, \\"[Bretz] is a seasoned Division I coach who we believe understands the broad picture of college athletics. Jim also brings to the program a high level of energy and integrity.\\" In 1995, Bretz's first season, the Hawks went 14-25 (10-12 NAC). Prior to the season, many players that had played for or been recruited by previous head coach Moe Morhardt quit the program. The team played the season with a 16-man roster. Bretz said of the season: \\"I got rid of some problems and some players cut themselves. We wanted to find out who was going to be the backbone of the team. ... We were planning for the future: 'This is how we'll play, conduct ourselves on the road and handle tough situations. We didn't have a chance to win. We had a five-man pitching staff. You have to give credit to the guys who stuck it out.\\" Hartford's best season under Bretz was 1996, when the team went 18-30-1 (10-14 NAC) and reached the NAC Tournament, where the Hawks finished third. After losing their opener to top-seeded Delaware, Hartford defeated #5 Northeastern and #2 Maine before being eliminated by Drexel. Following the 1997 season, in which Hartford missed the conference tournament, Bretz resigned for personal reasons. His overall record in three seasons at Hartford was 48-78-1. At Hartford, Bretz coached future Major Leaguer Earl Snyder, who played for the program from 1995‚Äì1998. Snyder played for the Cleveland Indians in 2002 and the Boston Red Sox in 2004. At Hartford, he set career records for home runs and RBI and was named to multiple all-conference and all-region teams. Bretz was a proponent of changing college baseball's bat rules while at Hartford. In 1996, the Richmond Times-Dispatch quoted him on the minus-5's then in use: \\"Across the board, something needs to be done. Somebody is going to get killed [because of metallic bats]. It's going to happen. I guess we'll keep buying those bats until it does.\\" In 1999, the NCAA adopted BESR standards to reduce the exit speed of baseballs off the bat. The NCAA made further reductions in bats' liveliness in the years following these new standards. =Head coaching record= Below is a table of Bretz's yearly records as a collegiate head baseball coach. Scouting career Bretz began working as a scout in the 2000s. He was the Northeast Supervisor for the Cleveland Indians from 2000‚Äì2001, and for the San Diego Padres from 2001-2015. He has held the same position for the Detroit Tigers since 2015. His signees include Will Venable, Andy Parrino, Brad Brach, Travis Jankowski, Luke Carlin, Nick Greenwood, and Brett Kennedy. Personal Bretz's father, James, worked as a scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates, among several other areas of professional baseball.

It is a Grade I listed country house, in the William-and Mary tradition,Pevsner, p.684 near St Maurice's Church in Plympton, commenced by Sir George Treby (1643‚Äì1700) and completed ‚Äì 1720 by his son George Treby ( ‚Äì 1742). The architect is unknown although accounts in 1720 refer to William Veale, mason. The house has had three main uses in its 300-year history: firstly a family home; secondly an asylum; and thirdly a convent and residential care home. Having been disused for several years, in 2016 a new plan was announced to bring the estate back into regular use with a sensitive redevelopment plan, creating a community of 14 homes across the site.  Description  Aerial view of the estate from the north in 2016 The main entrance is from Longcause to the south. Two pairs of tall stone gate piers (listed grade II) set in a concave red-brick boundary wall with up-swept coping (listed grade II) are surmounted by stone heraldic beasts. A second entrance to the estate, the West Gate from George Lane, passes the remains of the early 18th century stables and dairy barn to reach a courtyard on the west side of the house. The south facade of the main building is of Portland stone and comprises two storeys above a basement. The central pediment is ornamented with a carved coat of arms, and the facade is articulated by rusticated quoins. Due to the lie of the land, the basement storey is exposed to view on the west side of the building, which is constructed in brick with stone quoins and segment-headed windows. Externally the house is largely unaltered since the early 18th century, except for the construction of a late 20th-century east wing which housed ensuite bedrooms for the care home and a modern west wing which housed accommodation for the nuns and the chapel. North-west of the house are early 18th-century stables, a dairy barn, walled enclosures and courts, one of which formerly served as a wood yard. = Gardens = Early 18th-century walled garden enclosures surround the house. The main garden lies below the south facade of the house and is of about the same width as the building. It runs down to the principal entrance on Longcause. West of it, and parallel to it, lies the kitchen garden, between the north end of which and the south elevation of the stables is the Mount Garden. To the north of the house is a court, set into rising ground, which is laid down to grass. Parallel to the west facade of the house, and separated from it by a brick wall, is a narrow walk which extends the length of the kitchen garden, from which it is screened by a second high brick wall (listed grade II). At the north end of this walk a gate leads into the north-east corner of the Mount Garden which lies to the south-west of the house and to the north of the kitchen garden. This walled enclosure is dominated by a large mount high, which occupies most of the area. The south face of the north wall of the Mount Garden is constructed with recessed arcading for espaliered fruit trees. The walled kitchen garden lies to the south-west of the house and to the south of the Mount Garden. The rectangular area with its perimeter walk was originally subdivided into three sections by two internal walls running from east to west across it. The kitchen garden walls contain further recessed arcading for fruit trees. The north wall has been demolished. The present wall which screens the garden from George Lane is a late 20th-century reconstruction, necessitated by widening of the road beyond. History  It has been suggested that the site of Plympton House was, until , a group of medieval strip fields, possibly with early origins but there is no direct evidence of pre-medieval activity on the site and no record of excavations appear on the NMR Excavation Index. Opinions differ as to whether the development of the medieval town reached as far east as the site. The pattern of burgage plots suggests that it did not but it might reasonably be expected that some development would have occurred to the east of the castle, in the vicinity of the church. A medieval leper hospital stood at the junction of George Lane and the Ridgeway but this is some way from the site. As related below, there were however buildings on the site before 1700, the most likely location being along the frontage at the lower end of George Street and into Longcause, and archaeological evidence of them may survive. =Treby family= The building of Plympton House was begun by Sir George Treby (1643‚Äì1700). He had been baptised at Plympton St Mary, the son of Peter Treby \\"Gent\\" and after attending Exeter College Oxford studied law at Middle Temple and was called to the Bar in 1671. He had a successful legal practice and became Member of Parliament for Plympton in 1676. He held other important offices and was knighted in 1680 but fell from favour in 1683 and took little part in public affairs until the landing of William of Orange in 1688, following which he rose rapidly again, becoming Lord Chief Justice in 1689. He died in December 1700 in his 58th year. Sir George had decided to build a mansion near the house where he was born, believed to be the old manor house of Plympton Grange. Whether or not this was within the grounds of the present house is not clear. For some years in the late 17th century he assembled the site, acquiring land from several landowners. The site is on the east side of George Lane, then called Maudlin Street, which at the time had houses on either side. He had plans for the house and grounds and had cleared the site but had made little progress with the building work at the time of his death. His son, (also George) George Treby, who was later Secretary for War and a Privy Councillor, was then only 16 years old, but took over the project as soon as he was able, in about 1715. The Treby family's estate in the environs of the ancient Borough of Plympton, the Rotten Borough parliamentary constituency of which was known as Plympton Erle, was expanded following the marriage of Judge Treby's father to his mother Joan Snelling, daughter of John Snelling of Chaddle Wood, Plympton (which mansion house survives today after early 1800s rebuilding),Pevsner, p.686: Chaddlewood on Glen Road, off Ridgeway and co-heiress to her nephew Francis Snelling.HoP biography The Treby family's large landholdings within and around the Borough gave them great influence over parliamentary elections, which they shared with the Strode family of Newnham, major local landowners. Of the landed estate formerly attached to Plympton House, only an early 18th-century formal garden of 3 hectares remains.http://www.parksandgardens.org/places-and-people/site/2666 Paul Henry Ourry (1719‚Äì1783) of Plympton House, with his African servant \\"Jersey\\". Portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds. The estate was inherited by George Treby's eldest son, (also George) George Treby ( ‚Äì 1761), also MP for Plympton Erle, who died unmarried, and then passed to his younger brother, Colonel George Hele Treby ( ‚Äì 1763), who also died unmarried and also intestate. It then passed to his sister Charity Treby, daughter of the second George Treby, and wife of Admiral Paul Henry Ourry (1719‚Äì1783). Paul Ourry was the second son of Louis Ourry, a Huguenot refugee from Blois in France who had obtained British citizenship in 1713 and a commission in the British army.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/ourry- paul-henry-1719-83 The estate was later inherited by her son Paul Treby Ourry (1758‚Äì1832), who in 1785 by royal licence assumed the surname and arms of Treby, becoming therefore \\"Paul Treby Treby\\". Some time after the death of his mother in 1805, Paul Treby Treby moved to Goodamoor in Plympton St Mary parish and Plympton House was let to a succession of tenants. In 1811, Risdon described the house merely as the property of Paul Treby and in 1821 a guide book, The Panorama of Plymouth, says it was \\"at present uninhabited\\". There are conflicting accounts of this period but the house may have been unoccupied for as long as 40 years. = Asylum = It is reported a Dr Duck became a tenant around this time, using it as a private lunatic asylum. The identity of the mysterious Dr Duck is not clear but is seems that the asylum was set up in 1835 (possibly earlier) with Dr R. C. Langworthy as the proprietor and the 1841 tithe apportionment shows that Plympton House Gardens etc. and Back Lawn (the area north of the house up as far as the Ridgeway) with a total area of 7 3/4 acres, was owned by Laetitia Anne Treby and occupied by Richard Langworthy. Records of the early years of the asylum in the 1844 report of the Metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy describe appalling conditions for the patients and it was severely censured by the commissioners.1844 Report of the Metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy The institution was described as a mansion and outhouses asylum, and it seems that the proprietor and his family lived in some style in the house, while the pauper lunatics (66 in 1844) were housed in the outbuildings, confined in squalid conditions as it seems were some of the private patients, of which there were 17 the same year. Devon County Asylum was opened in July 1845 and by 1847 conditions had improved. By 1858 the asylum no longer received pauper patients. In 1876 the Treby family sold the property to Mr Coplestone Lopes Radcliff, who intended to re-develop the land but died before he could proceed, whereupon his son sold it to Dr Charles Aldridge and it continued as an asylum. A prospectus of that date describes the running of the institution. It was promoted as \\"licensed for the accommodation of insane persons of both sexes of the higher and middle classes\\". Dr Aldridge was the resident physician and proprietor and Joseph Aldridge the resident superintendent and general manager. The prospectus declared that Plympton House was a hospital rather than a place of detention. Dr Aldridge and his family lived in the house and it was the intention that they should mix freely with the patients and dine with them, and various forms of recreation were provided for the patients. Plympton House was acquired in 1921 by Dr J. C. Nixon who continued to use it as an asylum until 1933. =Convent and Residential Care Home= In 1933, coinciding with the sale of the house, it was described in an article in Country Life magazine with photographs. There is probably some artistic licence in the account but it describes the house and garden as having \\"scarcely been touched since the time it was built, threadbare but with all the bones of its formal garden still intact\\". In 1934 the premises were acquired by The Sisters of St Augustine, who established a home for the mentally ill, renaming the house St Peter's Convent. The premises were enlarged over the years, becoming a care home for up to 50 patients, the three Sisters being assisted by 80 staff. Ordnance survey plans of the 1950s show few changes since the establishment of the convent. By the 1960s the west boundary wall had been rebuilt, set back to allow the widening of George Lane. A recessed gateway had been formed and tree planting introduced replacing the yard to the west of the chapel garden. The chapel was described as such for the first time. A bank is clearly shown on the north side of the link to the chapel. The stable building had been demolished leaving the dairy. The building at the north end of the old service drive had been removed and the present mortuary building erected. Subsequently, in the 1980s, a further two-storey extension was built between the chapel building and north walled garden to provide accommodation for the Sisters, the track to the north modified and a car park constructed to the west of the chapel garden. In the 1990s the s extension on the east side of the house was enlarged and remodelled, with associated landscape works including vehicle access from the south garden. In 2012 St Peter's Care Home closed,http://www.plympton-house.com/#!the-present/rdpfh when the 44 bedroom Plympton House, with significant modern additions including an accommodation block and a convent with its own chapel, in all 2984 sq.m (32118 sq.ft), was offered for sale with 5.6 acres of surrounding gardens.http://www.drewpearce.co.uk/property- details/Plympton%20House%20brochure.pdf =Redevelopment= By 2015 Plympton House had no permanent use, with the only residents being a team from 'Protects By Occupation' to keep the building secure. In October 2015 a public consultation was launched with the object of bringing Plympton House back into use. The website stated: \\"The concept is to return the site to a low density residential usage that allows the main house to be restored to its former glory but in a way suitable for use in the 21st century, all the while enhancing the village of Plympton-St-Maurice.\\"http://www.plympton-house.com/ On 31 May 2016 Plymouth City Council granted conditional planning permission for change of use from care home to residential property and a scheme to develop a selection of 14 exclusive three to six bedroom properties was launched.http://edition.pagesuite- professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?eid=9424b399-a825-435d-a595-c1b9a2633dce&skip;=true The redevelopment includes some conversions of existing estate buildings and some new builds. Some plots were reserved for self-builders, others were sold as finished properties. Plympton House itself remains as one residence with a private driveway and private gardens.

The series is published in Japan by Tokuma Shoten in their Monthly Comic Ry≈´ magazine and by Seven Seas Entertainment in the United States, with the chapters collected and reprinted into fifteen tank≈çbon volumes to date. Monster Musume revolves around Kimihito Kurusu, a Japanese student whose life is thrown into turmoil after accidentally becoming involved with the \\"Interspecies Cultural Exchange\\" program. An anime adaptation aired from July to September 2015, and is licensed by Sentai Filmworks under the title Monster Musume: Everyday Life with Monster Girls. On July 18, 2020, Comic Ry≈´ blog announced a novel adaptation titled Monster Musume - Monster Girl„ÉªHello Walk, with Yoshino Origuchi, author of Monster Girl Doctor, as the writer. It is set to be published on August 29, 2020. Synopsis =Setting= For years, the Japanese government had kept a secret: mythical creatures such as centaurs, mermaids, harpies, and lamias are real.Monster Musume chapter 1 Three years before the start of the story, the government revealed the existence of these creatures and passed the \\"Interspecies Cultural Exchange Act\\". Since then, these creatures, known as \\"liminals\\", have become a part of human society, living with ordinary families like foreign exchange students and au-pair visitors, but with other duties and restrictions (the primary restrictions being that liminals and humans are forbidden from harming each other or procreating). =Plot= In Asaka, Saitama, Kimihito Kurusu did not volunteer for the exchange program. However, when Kuroko Smith delivered the very scared and embarrassed Miia to his door by mistake, he did not have the heart to send her away and they started living together. As the story continues, Kimihito meets and gives shelter to other female liminals, each of a different species. Some arrive more or less by accident, some are forced upon him by Smith, or force themselves in, and it does not take long for him to find himself in a hectic environment where he struggles to live in harmony with his new housemates while dealing with both their constant advances and the dramas of helping them get along in the human world. The situation takes on a new twist after he is told that because of expected changes in the law dealing with human-liminal relationships, he is expected, as a test case, to marry one of the girls, thus increasing their competition for his attention. However, as time passes, other liminal girls are attracted to him and begin to vie for his attention, much to Kimihito's embarrassment and the annoyance of his housemates.

Incidence of the involvement of the cardiovascular system in HIV infection. AIDS 2003;17:Suppl 1:S46‚Äì50. HIV is a major cause of cardiomyopathy (problems with the heart muscle that reduce the efficiency with which the heart pumps blood). The most common type of HIV induced cardiomyopathy is dilated cardiomyopathy also known as eccentric ventricular hypertrophy which leads to impaired contraction of the ventricles due to volume overload. The annual incidence of HIV associated dilated cardiomyopathy was 15.9/1000 before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).Barbarini G, Barbaro G.

However, the most researched cause of cardiomyopathy is myocarditis (myocardial inflammation and infection) caused by HIV-1, which the main subtype of HIV (the other being HIV-2), with greater likelihood of transmission and shorter period between infection and illness. HIV-1 virions infect cardiomyocytes in patches but there is no direct correlation between viral infection and dysfunction of cardiomyocytes. HIV- related cardiomyopathy is often not associated with any specific opportunistic infection, and approximately 40% of patients have not experienced any opportunistic infection before the onset of cardiac symptoms.Barbaro et.al., Incidence of Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Detection of HIV in Myocardial Cells of HIV-positive patients, NEJM 2002;347(2):140.Braunwald‚Äôs, Heart Disease A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, Volume II, 1793-1805. =Myocarditis= Myocarditis has been documented at autopsy in 40‚Äì52% of patients who died of AIDS before the introduction of HAART.Klatt EC, Nichols L, Noguchi TT.

Thus, it supports the hypothesis that HIV-1 has a pathogenetic action and influences dilated cardiomyopathy. Coinfection with viruses (usually, coxsackievirus B3 and cytomegalovirus) seems to have an important effect as the GISCA autopsy records show that 83% of patients with myocarditis and 50% with dilated cardiomyopathy were coinfected with viruses.Barbaro G, Di Lorenzo G, Grisorio B, et al., and the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio Cardiologico dei pazienti affetti da AIDS Investigators.

HIV-1 induces cardiomyopathy by cardiomyocyte invasion and gp120,Tat, and cytokine apoptotic signaling. Cardiovasc Toxicol 2004;4:97‚Äì107.Twu C, Liu QN, Popik W, et al. Cardiomyocytes undergo apoptosis in human immunodeficiency virus cardiomyopathy through mitochondrion and death receptor- controlled pathways. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2002;99:14386‚Äì91. In addition, HIV-1-associated protein gp 120 may induce apoptosis through a mitochondrion-controlled pathway after activating inflammatory cytokines.Twu C, Liu QN, Popik W, et al. Cardiomyocytes undergo apoptosis in human immunodeficiency virus cardiomyopathy through mitochondrion and death receptor- controlled pathways. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2002;99:14386‚Äì91. TNF-Œ± is produced by infected macrophages and the interaction between dendritic cells presenting the antigen to CD8 (T Killer cells).Liu QN, Reddy S, Sayre JW, et al. Essential role of HIV-1 infected and cyclooxygenase 2 activated macrophages and T cells in HIV type 1 myocarditis. AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 2001;17:1423‚Äì33.Matsumori A. Cytokines in myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Curr Opin Cardiol 1996;11:302‚Äì9. It causes a negative inotropic effect by interfering with the intracellular calcium ion concentrations perhaps by inducing the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), also decreasing contractility.Finkel MS, Oddis CV, Jacob TD, et al. Negative inotropic effects of cytokines on the heart mediated by nitric oxide. Science 1992;257:387‚Äì9.Yokohama T, Vaca L, Rossen RD, et al. Cellular basis for the negative inotropic effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha in the adult mammalian heart. J Clin Invest 1993;92:2303‚Äì12. The intensity of the stains for TNF-Œ± and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) of the myocardium was greater in patients with HIV associated cardiomyopathy (as opposed to idiopathic cardiomyopathy), myocardial viral infection and was inversely correlated with CD4 count with antiretroviral therapy having no effect. =Autoimmune cardiomyopathy= Cardiac autoimmunity affects the pathogenesis of HIV-related heart disease as HIV-infected patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are more likely to have cardiac-specific autoantibodies (anti- Œ±-myosin autoantibodies) than HIV-infected patients with healthy hearts and HIV-negative controls.Currie PF, Goldman JH, Caforio AL, et al. Cardiac autoimmunity in HIV related heart muscle disease. Heart 1998;79:599‚Äì604. In addition, patients with echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction had a higher chance of having cardiac autoantibodies. Furthermore, impaired myocardial growth and left ventricular dysfunction may be immunologically mediated as monthly intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) in HIV- infected children reduces left ventricular dysfunction, increases left ventricular wall thickness, and reduces peak left ventricular wall stress. Perhaps this is because immunoglobulins inhibit the cardiac autoantibodies by competing for Fc receptors. Alternatively, the immunoglobulins can reduce the effects or secretions of cytokines and cellular growth factors.Lipshultz SE, Easley KA, Orav EJ, et al. Cardiac dysfunction and mortality in HIV-infected children. The Prospective P2C2 HIV Multicenter Study. Circulation 2000;102:1542‚Äì8. =Encephalopathy= HIV-infected patients with encephalopathy are more likely to die of congestive heart failure than are those without encephalopathy; the hazard ratio is 3.4.Cooper ER, Hanson C, Diaz C, et al. Encephalopathy and progression of human immunodeficiency virus disease in a cohort of children with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection. J Pediatr 1998;132:808‚Äì12.Lipshultz SE, Easley KA, Orav EJ, et al. Left ventricular structure and function in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The prospective P2C2 HIV multicenter study. Circulation 1998;97:1246‚Äì56. Cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy are hypothesised to be linked by the HIV reservoir cells which are in the myocardium and cerebral cortex and keep HIV-1 on their surfaces for long periods of time even after receiving HAART. They also secrete TNF-Œ±, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and endothelin-1 which are cytotoxic cytokines causing tissue damage. =Drug cardiotoxicity= Zidovudine is an example of a nucleoside analogue and has been shown to cause: myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy as well as an increase in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL and insulin resistance.Lewis W, Grupp IL, Grupp G, et al. Cardiac dysfunction in the HIV-1 transgenic mouse treated with zidovudine. Lab Invest 2000;80:187‚Äì97.Lewis W, Simpson JF, Meyer RR. Cardiac mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma is inhibited competitively and noncompetitively by phosphorylated zidovudine. Circ Res 1994;74:344‚Äì8. Protease inhibitors are another group of drugs (e.g. ritonavir) and some of them can cause a range of problems such as: lipodystrophy, atherosclerosis, increase total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL, and insulin resistance. Amphotericin B can cause dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension and bradycardia whereas, Ganciclovir can cause ventricular tachycardia. Interferon-alpha can cause arrhythmia and myocardial infarction/ischemia.Barbaro et.al., Incidence of Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Detection of HIV in Myocardial Cells of HIV-positive patients, NEJM 2002;347(2):140Braunwald‚Äôs, Heart Disease A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, Volume II, 1793-1805 Treatment Mortality in HIV- infected patients with cardiomyopathy is increased independently of CD4 count, age, sex, and HIV risk group.Barbaro et.al., Incidence of Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Detection of HIV in Myocardial Cells of HIV-positive patients, NEJM 2002;347(2):140.Braunwald‚Äôs, Heart Disease A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, Volume II, 1793-1805. The therapy is similar to therapy for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: after medical therapy is begun, serial echocardiographic studies should be performed at 4-months intervals. If function continues to worsen or the clinical course deteriorates, a biopsy should be considered.Barbaro et.al., Incidence of Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Detection of HIV in Myocardial Cells of HIV-positive patients, NEJM 2002;347(2):140.Braunwald‚Äôs, Heart Disease A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, Volume II, 1793-1805. HAART has reduced the incidence of myocarditis thus reducing the prevalence of HIV-associated cardiomyopathy by about 30% in developed countries.Bijl M, Dieleman JP, Simoons M, et al. Low prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in an HIV-seropositive population on antiretroviral combination therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 2001;27:318‚Äì20.Pugliese A, Isnardi D, Saini A, et al. Impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive patients with cardiac involvement. J Infect 2000;40:282‚Äì4. However, the prevalence in developing countries is 32% and increasing as HAART is scarce ‚Äì not to mention the effects of other risk factors such as high cholesterol and lipid diet.Nzuobontane D, Blackett KN, Kuaban C. Cardiac involvement in HIV-infected people in Yaounde, Cameroon. Postgrad Med J 2002;78:678‚Äì81. IVIGs can also help patients with HIV-associated myocarditis as mentioned earlier.

It was originally proposed by the physicist Roger Penrose in his 2004 book The Road to Reality specifically to prove whether unconventional decoherence processes such as gravitationally induced decoherence or spontaneous wave-function collapse of a quantum system occur. Later revised to take place as a tabletop experiment, if successful, it is estimated that a mass of roughly 1014 atoms would have been superposed, approximately nine orders of magnitude more massive than any superposition observed to that date (2003).  Configuration  Figure 2. A Michelson interferometer. The proposed experimental setup is basically a variation of the Michelson interferometer but for a single photon. Additionally, one of the mirrors has to be very tiny and fixed on an isolated micromechanical- oscillator. This allows it to move when the photon is reflected on it, so that it may become superposed with the photon. The purpose is to vary the size of the mirror to investigate the effect of the mass on the time it takes for the quantum system to collapse. Originally the arms of the interferometer had to stretch into the hundreds of thousands of kilometers to achieve a photon roundtrip-time comparable to the oscillator's period, but that meant that the experiment had to take place in-orbit, reducing its viability. The revised proposal requires that the mirrors be placed into high-finesse optical cavities that will trap the photons long enough to achieve the desired delay. There are various technological challenges, but all are within high-end laboratory capabilities. The primary requirement is that the mass of the cavity remains as small as possible. To avoid noise on the interferometer and have a low probability of emitting more than one photon each time, a very low absolute temperature for the experiment is needed, on the order of 60 ŒºK. For similar reasons, and to avoid decoherence, the experimental device has to be in ultra-high vacuum conditions. The wavelength of the photons was calculated to be roughly 630 nm so the reflecting surfaces can be as small as possible and yet avoid refraction and reflectivity issues. The micromechanical- oscillator can be similar to the cantilevers in atomic force microscopy and the reflective surfaces typically used in similar high-demanding experiments pose no real challenge. Various elaborate electromagnetic mechanisms have been proposed to \\"reset\\" the cavities to a stable state before each repetition of the experiment.

Written in Bengali on the request of Bhaktivinoda's son Lalita Prasad, Svalikhita-jivani gives a detailed autobiographical account that spanned most of his life from his birth in 1838 until retirement in 1894. The book was published by Lalita Prasad in 1916, after Bhaktivinoda's death. Summary On the request of his son Lalita Prasad, in 1896 Bhaktivinoda wrote a detailed autobiography called Svalikhita- jivani that covered 56 years of his life from birth up until that time. Recounting his life's episodes with candour, Bhaktivinoda portrayed his path as full of financial struggle, health issues, internal doubts and insecurity, and deep introspection that gradually led him, sometimes in convoluted ways, to the deliberate and mature decision of accepting Caitanya Mahaprabhu and his teachings as his final goal. Bhaktivinoda did not display much concern for how this candid account would reflect on his status as an established Gaudiya Vaisnava spiritual leader with a large following, in the eyes of thousands of his intellectual bhadralok disciples. It is telling that Bhaktivinoda never refers to himself as feeling or displaying any special spiritual acumen, saintlihood, powers, or charisma ‚Äì anything worthy of veneration. Rather, the honest, almost self-deprecating narrative portrays him as a genuine, exceptionally humble and modest man. The book was published by Lalita Prasad in 1916 after Bhaktivinoda's passing.

Sweden's neutrality was tested when Nazi Germany and Finland demanded that Sweden allow the transit of the Wehrmacht's 163rd Infantry Division by railroad from Norway to Finland. After the 1939 German-Soviet invasion of Poland, Swedish prime minister Per Albin Hansson declared strict neutrality and called for the formation of a coalition government involving all major parties under his leadership; this was realized in December, with the exception of the Communist Party. With Spain, Liechtenstein, Portugal, Switzerland, Ireland and the Vatican, Sweden maintained neutrality throughout World War II and cooperated with both sides. According to Winston Churchill, during the war Sweden ignored the greater moral issues and played both sides for profit (particularly in the German occupation of Denmark and Norway, supported by transportation through Sweden sanctioned by Hansson's cabinet). Evolution Gustaf V and Per Albin Hansson, two leading figures in the 1941 events Operation Barbarossa, the 22 June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, sparked an ultimatum by the government of Nazi Germany to Hansson's cabinet demanding military concessions (including German troop transports on Swedish railways to support German ally Finland). The political deliberations surrounding this ultimatum have become known as the \\"midsummer crisis\\", which (allegedly after King Gustav V's threat to abdicate if the concessions were not made) was resolved in favor of the Axis. Although the 83-year-old king had not directly intervened in government policy since 1914, Gustav had the formal power to appoint his own cabinet; his open intervention in the issue was seen as a threat to the stability of the government and, given the ongoing war, to the nation's sovereignty. However, according to research published in 2002 by Carl-Gustaf Scott \\"the crisis was created in historical hindsight in order to protect the political legacy of the Social Democratic Party and its leader Per Albin Hansson.\\" The Social Democratic Party and the Riksdag were divided on the issue. Hansson, implying that the king would abdicate if the German ultimatum was refused, succeeded in getting the Riksdag to make a decision acceptable to the other political parties. One reason for the approval was Finland's expected reaction to a denial; its security relied on outside support provided only by Germany. German Foreign Ministry official Karl Schnurre told Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Christian G√ºnther that without an agreement, Finland would be drawn into the European conflict. The \\"midsummer crisis\\", highly publicized in 1941, was interpreted as a sign of King Gustav V's personal responsibility for Swedish weakness towards Nazi Germany. The king's actions were confirmed by German foreign-policy documents captured at the end of the war. On 25 June 1941, the German minister in Stockholm sent a \\"Most Urgent-Top Secret\\" message to Berlin stating that the king had just informed him that the transit of German troops would be allowed: > The King's words conveyed the joyful emotion he felt. He had lived through > anxious days and had gone far in giving his personal support to the matter. > He added confidentially that he had found it necessary to go so far as to > mention his abdication.Documents of German Foreign Policy 1918‚Äì1945 Series D > Volume XIII The War Years 23 June 1941 ‚Äì 11 December 1941, Published in UK > by HMSO and in US By Government Printing Office. According to Ernst Wigforss, Gustaf V and Prince Gustav Adolf attempted to persuade the Swedish government to allow the Allies to transport troops through Sweden; this was rejected due to concerns about German retribution. The German-led invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, commenced on 22 June 1941. Due to Germany's involvement with Finland, Soviet forces attacked Finland on 25 June. In response, Finland saw itself as being at war with the Soviet Union. Sweden subsequently began its rail transport of the German 163rd Infantry Division.

Early life  George L. Clarke was born in Norton, Massachusetts. His parents were Reverend Pitt Clarke, a well-known pastor of the First Congregational Society in Newtown, and Maria (Simpson) Clarke. His schooling was a combination of home schooling from his parents; a few months spent at a public school in Norton; and \\"one or two quarters\\" in a private academy. Upon turning 16, he left school and worked in a store in Providence. He supplemented his education by attending public lectures known as \\"Lyceum Lectures\\". Clarke was a staunch and outspoken abolitionist from an early age, and became well-known throughout the state for his anti-slavery views, even in a time when such views were not popular.  Political career  Clarke was first a member of the Liberty Party which later became the Free Soil Party. When that became absorbed into the Republican Party in 1854, Clarke became a Republican. He served in the State House of Representatives in 1856 to 1858, then again in 1863-1868. He was Speaker of the House for the last two of those years. He was elected to the State Senate in April 1869. A month after Clarke's election to State Senate, Providence's popular mayor Thomas A. Doyle left the Republican Party to run as an independent. The Republican party drafted Clarke to run against him. Clarke won in a three-way race, but Doyle returned to defeat Clarke the following year, winning by a two-to-one margin. During Clarke's time as mayor, a system of fire alarm boxes were installed in Providence. The Sockanosset Reservoir was begun, and Dexter Asylum was enlarged. A major hurricane struck the city on September 8, 1869, which caused much damage and flooding in downtown Providence. After his mayorship, Clarke was elected to the Board of Aldermen from the First Ward. Later he became president of the City Fire Insurance Company.  Personal life  Clarke married Frances Alice Chace, daughter of a textile firm owner. Clarke went to work at the firm, William A. Chace and Company. The couple lived at 95 Angell Street in Providence's east side.  References   External links  *Mayor George L.

Comfortable with nudity, she wrapped pythons around her body and became famous in her time. Biography Born in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Esp√≠rito Santo, she was the fifteenth child of the Italian immigrants Etelvina and Antonio Vivacqua, and the sister of Senator Attilio Vivacqua. In the 1930s, she was hospitalized in Belo Horizonte for two months because of her parents' claims that her behaviour was schizophrenic. After her release, Vivacqua moved to one of her brother's farm. There, she assaulted her brother, put grape vines on her breasts and pubis, and carried two vine snakes. She was hospitalized again, this time in Rio de Janeiro. Luz del Fuego, 1944 In 1944, she began performing as a dancer using the stage name \\"Luz Divina\\", changing it to Luz del Fuego in 1947, the name of a lipstick in the Argentine market. In 1946, she appeared in Franz Eichhorn's film No Trampolim da Vida, and the following year, starred in Luis Moglia Barth's Argentine-Brazilian co-production N√£o Me Digas Adeus. In 1948, she appeared in Moacyr Fenelon's musical comedy Poeira de Estrelas opposite Lourdinha Bittencourt and Emilinha Borba, and also had a role in Manoel Jorge and H√©lio Thys's musical comedy Folias Cariocas. On the Ilha do Sol (Sun Island), she established the first naturist club in Brazil, the \\"Brazilian Naturist Club\\". In the early 1950s, she founded a political party called the Brazilian Naturist Party and ran for Congresswoman for this party. She lost the election as her brother, Attilio, denied the party's official establishment. In 1956, she made an appearance in Curt Siodmak's Curucu, Beast of the Amazon which was being filmed in rural Argentina, and in 1959 starred in Al Ghiu's comedy picture Comendo de Colher. Del Fuego had a final role, which went uncredited, in Robert Day's Tarzan and the Great River in 1967 before she was murdered by a fisherman that year whom she had threatened to denounce for overfishing. Legacy Her life was portrayed in the 1982 film, Luz del Fuego, directed by David Neves and featuring Luc√©lia Santos in the lead role. In November 2013, a lost documentary titled A Nativa Solit√°ria was found by the Esp√≠rito Santo Public Archive and restored by it. Because of her courage to face the prejudice of her time with regard to nudity, and for pioneering the creation of the first naturist club in Brazil, her birth date, February 21, is remembered and celebrated among Brazilian naturists as \\"Day of Naturism\\".

Every two non-adjacent vertices can be connected by a rainbow path, either directly through the center vertex (bottom left) or by detouring around one triangle to avoid a repeated edge color (bottom right). In graph theory, a path in an edge-colored graph is said to be rainbow if no color repeats on it. A graph is said to be rainbow-connected (or rainbow colored) if there is a rainbow path between each pair of its vertices. If there is a rainbow shortest path between each pair of vertices, the graph is said to be strongly rainbow-connected (or strongly rainbow colored).  Definitions and bounds  The rainbow connection number of a graph G is the minimum number of colors needed to rainbow-connect G, and is denoted by \\\\text{rc}(G). Similarly, the strong rainbow connection number of a graph G is the minimum number of colors needed to strongly rainbow-connect G, and is denoted by \\\\text{src}(G). Clearly, each strong rainbow coloring is also a rainbow coloring, while the converse is not true in general. It is easy to observe that to rainbow-connect any connected graph G, we need at least \\\\text{diam}(G) colors, where \\\\text{diam}(G) is the diameter of G (i.e. the length of the longest shortest path). On the other hand, we can never use more than m colors, where m denotes the number of edges in G. Finally, because each strongly rainbow-connected graph is rainbow-connected, we have that \\\\text{diam}(G) \\\\leq \\\\text{rc}(G) \\\\leq \\\\text{src}(G) \\\\leq m. The following are the extremal cases: *\\\\text{rc}(G) = \\\\text{src}(G) = 1 if and only if G is a complete graph. *\\\\text{rc}(G) = \\\\text{src}(G) = m if and only if G is a tree. The above shows that in terms of the number of vertices, the upper bound \\\\text{rc}(G) \\\\leq n - 1 is the best possible in general. In fact, a rainbow coloring using n - 1 colors can be constructed by coloring the edges of a spanning tree of G in distinct colors. The remaining uncolored edges are colored arbitrarily, without introducing new colors. When G is 2-connected, we have that \\\\text{rc}(G) \\\\leq \\\\lceil n/2 \\\\rceil. Moreover, this is tight as witnessed by e.g. odd cycles.  Exact rainbow or strong rainbow connection numbers  The rainbow or the strong rainbow connection number has been determined for some structured graph classes: *\\\\text{rc}(C_n) = \\\\text{src}(C_n) = \\\\lceil n/2 \\\\rceil, for each integer n \\\\geq 4, where C_n is the cycle graph. *\\\\text{rc}(W_n) = 3, for each integer n \\\\geq 7, and \\\\text{src}(W_n) = \\\\lceil n/3 \\\\rceil, for n \\\\geq 3, where W_n is the wheel graph.  Complexity  The problem of deciding whether \\\\text{rc}(G) = 2 for a given graph G is NP-complete. Because \\\\text{rc}(G) = 2 if and only if \\\\text{src}(G) = 2, it follows that deciding if \\\\text{src}(G) = 2 is NP- complete for a given graph G.  Variants and generalizations  Chartrand, Okamoto and Zhang generalized the rainbow connection number as follows. Let G be an edge-colored nontrivial connected graph of order n. A tree T is a rainbow tree if no two edges of T are assigned the same color. Let k be a fixed integer with 2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n. An edge coloring of G is called a k-rainbow coloring if for every set S of k vertices of G, there is a rainbow tree in G containing the vertices of S. The k-rainbow index \\\\text{rx}_k(G) of G is the minimum number of colors needed in a k-rainbow coloring of G. A k-rainbow coloring using \\\\text{rx}_k(G) colors is called a minimum k-rainbow coloring. Thus \\\\text{rx}_2(G) is the rainbow connection number of G. Rainbow connection has also been studied in vertex-colored graphs. This concept was introduced by Krivelevich and Yuster. Here, the rainbow vertex-connection number of a graph G, denoted by \\\\text{rvc}(G), is the minimum number of colors needed to color G such that for each pair of vertices, there is a path connecting them whose internal vertices are assigned distinct colors.

The arch was built by the people of Pagsanjan to express gratitude to their patroness, the Our Lady of Guadalupe, from protecting the town from bandits in 1877.  Location  The arch is located at the western entrance of the town along the National Highway. It leads to Rizal Street (formerly Calle Real) of the town.  History  = The Story of the Bandits and the Virgin of Guadalupe = Bandits (or tulisanes) were rampant in Laguna during the last years of the Spanish colonization. Even the guardia civil at that time cannot control the acts of the tulisanes. On midnight of December 8, 1877, a group of bandits led by Tangkad who already plundered the nearby town of Majayjay is nearly approaching the western entrance of Pagsanjan. When the bandits are approaching the town, a beautiful lady dressed in white and holding a shining sword appeared to them. Using her sword, she drew a line and proclaimed that the town is under her protection. The bandits experienced fear and immediately went to the mountains. Mang Juan, a sabungero who lives near the western entrance saw the whole event because of his insomnia that night. He told the event to the Spanish cura who later told it to the government authorities. All of them do not believe the story of Mang Juan until they went to the exact site and saw the mark of the Virgin's sword. To express their gratitude to their patroness, the Virgin of Guadalupe, they built a stone gate on the exact site where they saw the mark of the Virgin's sword. = Construction and Restoration of the Arch = Under the supervision of a Franciscan priest, Fray Cipriano Bac and Don Manuel de Yriarte, the Pagsanjan Arch was built from 1878 to 1880 by the town people through forced labor or polo y servicio. It was also known as Puerta Real or Royal Gate during the Spanish and American occupation. During the Japanese liberation of the town, municipal authorities vandalized the historic gate by having it painted in a gaudy pink color, including the coat-of-arms and the two Castillan lions. The word Pagsanjan and the years of its construction, 1878‚Äì1880, written below it on the upper part of the gate's western facade were defaced and replaced with the greeting, \\"Welcome\\", and on the eastern side, \\"Thank U, Come Again\\". Historian Gregorio F. Zaide, a native of the town, started a project to restore the historic gate through Pagsanje√±os in Manila who generously gave ‚Ç±5,000. Upon obtaining permission from the National Historic Institute (now National Historical Commission of the Philippines), the restoration process commenced under the supervision of Engr. Tito Rivera and was completed on May 25, 1975. A large copper plaque was placed on the wall of the first arch to thank the donors. Today, the Pagsanjan arch still stands on a main thoroughfare of the town.  Architectural style  Pagsanjan arch is well known for its three Roman arches or gates made of adobe stones, lime and carabao milk. On top of the arch is the Royal coat-of-arms of Spain (or escutcheon) in gold and yellow guarded by two red Castillan lions. Heritage designation Historical marker The arch was declared as a national landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines on December 6, 2018. A historical marker was unveiled.

Operations On 10 April 2010, the European Union launched a military training mission in Somalia (EUTM Somalia), with a mandate to support the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and assist in strengthening national institutions. EUTM Somalia was originally centered on training activities. Due to the political and security situation in Somalia at the time, the mission initially conducted training abroad in Uganda. Its headquarters were temporarily based in Kampala, and training was held at a military camp in Bihanga. On 22 January 2013, the Council of the European Union extended EUTM Somalia's mandate for a third time to March 2015, in the process adding strategic advisory and mentoring activities to the mission's areas of focus. Since its establishment, EUTM Somalia officials have trained around 3,600 Somali army personnel. In the first few months of 2014, the mission permanently transferred all of its advisory, mentoring and training activities to Somalia, where it now operates a Mentoring Advisory and Training Element (MATE HQ) in Mogadishu. In February 2014, EUTM Somalia began its first \\"Train the Trainers\\" programme at the Jazeera Training Camp in Mogadishu. 60 Somali National Army soldiers that had been previously trained by EUTM would take part in a four-week refresher course on infantry techniques and procedures, including international humanitarian law and military ethics. The training would be conducted by 16 EU trainers. Following the course's completion, the Somali soldiers would be qualified as instructors to then train SNA recruits, with mentoring provided by EUTM Somalia personnel. A team of EUTM Somalia advisors also started offering strategic advice to the Somali Ministry of Defence and General Staff. Additionally, capacity building, advice and specific mentoring with regard to security sector development and training are envisioned for 2014. Mission EUTM Somalia is partnered with the Somali authorities to a build a professional national military that is accountable to the Somali government. Its activities take place within the framework of the European Union's overall presence in Somalia, including political, security and civic engagement. Commanders As of March 2015, EUTM Somalia was commanded by Brigadier General Antonio Maggi (Italy). He succeeded Brigadier General Massimo Mingiardi (Italy), Brigadier General Gerald Aherne (Ireland), Colonel Michael Beary (Ireland), and Colonel Ricardo Gonzalez Elul (Spain). Funding Between February 2013-March 2015, common funding for EUTM Somalia totals ‚Ç¨11.6 million. Partnerships EUTM Somalia works in close cooperation and coordination with other international parties and stakeholders. Among these are the United Nations, the United States Department of State, and the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Additionally, EUTM Somalia has a Support Cell in Brussels and a Liaison Office in Nairobi.

Besides this he worked as musician and choirmaster as well as conductor and dramaturg  Biography  Jakob Streit was born in the Berner Oberland in Switzerland, the son of a watchmaker, and lived there for most of his life. He had four brothers and sisters and everyone helped to tend the family beehives, their cow and calf and their sheep.Biographical sketch on the Jakob Streit Homepage He studied Education at the teacher training college in Bern, where his skills in Music, Education and Literature were honed. His musical education he completed with Hans Klee, the father of artist Paul Klee,Obituary of Eva Streit then began on a career as teacher of different age groups, in the course of which the many stories he told to the children were published as children's stories in over forty books. Many of these are translated into English and other languages. His educational method, and particularly his music instruction drew heavily on the indications of Rudolf Steiner on Waldorf education. ‚ÄúWhen one has told stories to different age groups of children for 45 years on a daily basis, one learns a great deal from them, one is carried on the wings of Poetry, of the imagination. In later years, this interest grows into everything that is truly human. For example, this is how I came to write my first book about gnomes: A girl in the third grade brought a beautiful Edelweiss to my desk one morning, saying: ‚ÄúMy father gave it to me and told me that, if you can tell us how the Edelweiss came about, you can keep it.‚Äù Quickly the children all sat down at their desks, for in their eyes the teacher of the third grade is capable of anything at all. Forty pairs of eyes are looking expectantly at you. (‚Ä¶) I began thoughtfully; soon there were gnomes and elves in the picture, finding magic ways to transform the stars of the night into the Edelweiss. Carried by the astonished eyes of the children, my story must have gone on for about 20 minutes. When the Edelweiss had finally been created, a little boy stood up and proclaimed: ‚ÄúTomorrow you must deal with the Gentian.‚Äù In this manner, from day to day, we found our way through the different flowers of the mountains. I was not able to prepare at all. I needed the children to be there. Afterwards I wrote down the stories that had come about. They have been published as ‚ÄúBergblumen M√§rchen‚Äù today with the publisher Oratio Verlag in Schaffhausen.‚Äù After producing plays with children, he broadened his interest to amateur theatre direction, in the course of which he inaugurated the William Tell festival plays in Interlaken and the Spiez Castle Plays.Schloss Spiele Spiez Having studied Piano and Organ, his work as choir conductor led him to produce a succession of operas, amongst others The Magic Flute and Orpheus and Euridice.Bibliomedia, Switzerland Questions of Art, Art History and culture occupied him all his life and after his retirement he began to lecture in most of Europe besides increasing the scope of his literary work. For many years he was editor of the AVS-Mitteilungen, the newssheet of the Anthroposophische Vereinigung in der Schweiz, continuing with this until his death at 99 years of age.

The Harfush dynasty was in control of the Baalbek District and several parts of the Bekaa Valley. The religion they praised was a huge factor to the rivalry between the Harfushes and the Lebanese Druze Maan family. The Shiite notables such as the Harfush emirs of Baalbek and Bekaa Valley were among the most sought-after local intermediaries of the Ottoman state. Later on was the rise of the Hamadas, who exercised control over multiple tax farms in the rural hinterland of Tripoli in the seventeenth century through a complex matrix of rapports with both the Ottoman state authorities and the local non-Shiite communities,Winter, 2010, p. 5 (Argument). they both belonged to Shia Islam in Lebanon, the Harfush emirate of the Bekaa Valley and the Hamadas of Mt Lebanon rivalled the territorial extension and power of the Druze emirate of the Shuf. Unlike the Druze, the Shiite emirs were regularly denounced for their religious identity and persecuted under Ebu's-Suud's definition of (Kƒ±zƒ±lba≈ü) heretics.Winter, 2010, pp. 31, 32. The Harfushes had been a regionally paramount dynasty since early Mamluk times and even served as patrons of local Shiite shrines and scholars. To the Ottomans they were therefore always leading candidates for local fiscal and gubernatorial offices, including for the military governorship of the sub-province of Homs, to which they were appointed partially to offset the influence of the increasingly hegemonic Druze emirate.The Shiite Emirates of Ottoman Syria (Mid-17th‚ÄìMid-18th Century), Stefan Helmut Winter, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois August 2002, page 15. The Harfushes are doubtless the best-known Shiite group in Ottoman-period Lebanese history. As a result of their early rivalry with the Druze Ma‚Äòn emirs, their constant interaction with Christian communities in the Bekaa and finally their subjugation to the Shihabi emirate, the Harfushes achieved a high profile in the narrative chronicles of the day by their rule over Baalbek and parts of the Bekaa and their demise, after the 1860 civil war.Winter, 2010, p. 45 History =Fifteenth century= The Harfushes were already well established in the Bekaa on the eve of the Ottoman conquest. The late-Mamluk popular historian Ibn Tawq identifies an Ibn Harfush as muqaddam of the Anti-Lebanon mountain village Jubbat ‚ÄòAssal as early as 1483; Ibn al- Himsi and Ibn Tulun mention one as deputy (na‚Äôib) of Baalbek in 1498. Ibn Harfush appears in an Ottoman archival source as early as 1516, when he and several other local notables signed a letter offering their submission to Sultan Selim I. The Harfushes‚Äô initial relationship with their new masters seems to have been problematic, however.Winter, 2010, p. 46 =Sixteenth century= There is no further word on Musa Harfush's eventual participation in the Yemen campaign (which was in fact directed against the forces of the Zaydi Shiite imam), and in later years the Harfushes would be appointed sancak-beƒüs of Homs and Tadmur rather than of Sidon. If nothing else, his being selected to lead a tribal auxiliary division in return for an official governorship in 1568, more than twenty years before the Ma‚Äòn family received their emiral title, points towards both the possibilities and the limits of Shiite enfranchisement under Ottoman rule: the progressive monetarization of provincial government and the privatization of military power in the later sixteenth century created a context in which non- Sunni tribal leaders constituted viable, even ideal, candidates for local tax and police concessions, accredited by the state and integrated into the imperial military administrative hierarchy. Yet their success would also depend on their ability to hold sway locally, to transcend their narrow parochial bases, raise revenues and capitalize on western Syria's changing economic situation. The Harfush emirs were among the first in the region to be co-opted by the Ottoman state, but would in the long run not stand up to the competition of other local forces.Winter, 2010, p. 43 Turning Sidon-Beirut into a beƒülerbeƒülik As elsewhere in the Empire, administrative units such as sancaks, eyalets and tax farms were not precisely delimited but could be reorganized according to the government's needs or the assignee's personal importance. We have already seen that the Ottomans briefly contemplated turning Sidon-Beirut into a beƒülerbeƒülik under ‚ÄòAli Harfush in 1585; starting in 1590 Fakhr al-Din Ma‚Äòn and his sons held Safad and then Sidon-Beirut for many years as sancak-beƒüs.Winter, 2010, 120 =Seventeenth century= Battle of ‚ÄòAnjar The Harfush leader Emir Yunus al-Harfush was in a conflict with the Lebanese Druze lord Fakhr al-Din in the early 1600s because of that conflict Fakhr al-Din decided to pull into the Bekaa valley. The Harfush dynasty wanted to take over the Ma'an family realm during Fakhr al- Din's exile. Yunus had an ally, Mustafa Pasha who was the governor of Damascus. Yunus and Pasha wanted to take the sanjak of Safad from Fakhr al- Din. Fakhr al-din returned from Italy, marched across the Bekaa. He captured Mustafa Pasha and defeated the Harfush's Emir. Bekaa Valley before and after the battle of ‚ÄòAnjar can be obtained from a recently published register of iltizam appointments for the province of Damascus. Covering the years 1616 to 1635, the register among other things provides documentary evidence of the Harfushes‚Äô growing marginalization as well as of the rise of the Shihabis of Wadi Taym as new contenders for government tax farms in the region. Beginning in 1618, for example, around the time of Fakhr al-Din's return from Tuscany, Yunus Harfush came under pressure to renounce the income normally due to the emin of Baalbek from the village of ‚ÄòAytha, after the mufti of Damascus (a native of ‚ÄòAytha) had petitioned for it to be set aside for himself in the supposed interest of reviving and repopulating the area. Even in later years, after the Harfushes had retaken control of the Bekaa from the Ma‚Äòns and the mufti was long dead, the village remained formally excluded from their holdings. The register also sheds light on the administrative context of the fitna (strife) between the Harfushes and Ma‚Äòns in 1623‚Äì24. It corroborates local chroniclers‚Äô claims that Fakhr al-Din offered to send the sultan 100,000 gold coins for the Baalbek tax concession, but casts doubt on the notion that the governor of Damascus simply ‚Äòpaid no heed‚Äô to the offer or ignored the Sublime Porte's orders to instate him. Fakhr al-Din's offer was matched by Yunus, and the iltizam was reconfirmed to his son ‚ÄòAli Harfush by the kadƒ±s of Damascus and Baalbek immediately after the battle of ‚ÄòAnjar.Winter, 2010, pp. 53, 54. One of their well-known scholars There was at least one Imami scholar from the Bekaa by the name of Harfush in the Ottoman period: Muhammad ibn ‚ÄòAli al-Harfushi (died 1649), a cloth-maker, grammarian and poet from Karak Nuh, was apparently persecuted for rafd in Damascus and then moved to Iran, where he received an official state post. =Eighteenth century= The battle of Ayn Dara and the role of Harfush's emir The Harfushes appear to have been back in control of Baalbek by 1702, when local accounts indicate that a Christian shaykh of ‚ÄòAqura in Mt Lebanon entered emir Husayn‚Äôs(Harfush) service as yazƒ±cƒ±, or secretary, on account of his Turkish skills. In 1711, French consular reports suggest, Husayn Harfush gave shelter to Haydar Shihabi and then supplied 2,500 troops to help him wipe out his Druze rivals in the Battle of Ain Dara, and establish himself as sole emir of the Shuf. curiously not addressed in H. A. al-Shihabi or any other chronicles of the period.Winter, 2010, p. 148 Support to the Shiites of Mount Lebanon The Ottoman court historian Ra≈üid (d. 1735) telescopes several important events into his official account (but omits the atrocities committed against the Shiite villagers). The Hamadas, who were supported by the  øAwjan as well as the Harfush, were caught in heavy snows while fleeing toward Baalbek. An estimated 150 men perished. Only the Khazins now prevented the wholesale slaughter of the survivors, by disingenuously claiming they had no permission from Maan to leave the province of Tripoli, and directed the imperial forces elsewhere. Still, Ali Pa≈üa was not to be satisfied. A manhunt began for the Hamadas and their confederates, Shiite or otherwise. Untold villages were torched, women enslaved, and severed heads brought back to Tripoli. In late August, he sent another army into the Ftuh just to pillage the farmsteads. In the course of an attempt to retrieve some of their animals, Husayn ibn Sirhan, his cousin Hasan Dib and several companions were caught and killed.Ibn Nujaym, \\"Nubdha\\", pp. 817-818. In late October, when Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulusi visited Tripoli, Ali Pa≈üa was still out \\"battling the pertinacious heretics, the Hamada faction\\".Archivum Ottomanicum, Edited by Gy√∂rgy Hazai 18 (2000) page 215 and 216 øAbd al-Ghanƒ´ al-NƒÅbulusƒ´ (d. 1731), al-·∏§aqƒ´qa wa-‚Äôl-MujƒÅz fƒ´ Ri·∏•la BilƒÅd al-ShƒÅm wa-Mi·π£r wa-‚Äôl-·∏§ijƒÅz, ed.

Close alliance to the Orthodox Like the Hamadas, the Harfush emirs were involved on more than one occasion in the selection of church officials and the running of local monasteries. Tradition holds that many Christians quit the Baalbek region in the eighteenth century for the newer, more secure town of Zahle on account of the Harfushes‚Äô oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that the Harfushes were closely allied to the Orthodox Ma‚Äòluf family of Zahle (where Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahle's growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek's decline in the eighteenth century. What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite ‚ÄòUsayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek in this period to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes, establishing itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even serving as consuls of Iran.Winter, 2010, 166 =Siege of Zahle= Says a contemporary Christian historian of the siege of Zahle' in 1841: \\"The harfushes did not credit Zahle' only, but also all Christians in Lebanon. The Christians would have been humiliated if they had lost their battle (Zahle‚Äô) against the Duruze, who had (the Duruze) earlier won the battle in Deir Al Qamar\\"(The Harfushes stood behind the Christians and defeated the Duruze in the battle field of Zahle').hoser al litham aan nakabat al sham, Makarios, p. 13. =End= In 1865 the Ottoman government ordered to send the last Harfush emirs to Edirne in Turkey for exile; later most of them returned to Baalbeck, but others could not and stayed in Istanbul; subsequently Emir Ahmad bin Mohamad bin Soultan El -Harfouche was transferred to Cairo.Saadoun Hamada, the history of the Shiites in Lebanon, Volume I, 2013 edition, page 371. =Effect of disappearance of the Harfush emirate= The abrupt disappearance of the Harfush emirate left the Shiite community of Baalbek bereft of any anciently rooted, indigenous social leadership, making it that much more of a likely venue for the rise of foreign-inspired, ideological mass movements such as Communism, Nasirism and the Hizb Allah in Lebanon's tumultuous 20th century.The Shiite Emirates of Ottoman Syria (Mid-17th -Mid-18th Century), Stefan Helmut Winter, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois August 2002, page 236. Present Today, Al Harfouch still own large acres of lands in Baalbek, the main cemetery of Baalbek and two villages are left in their memory, the Harfouche village and the Mrah el Harfouch village. The name of Yunus al-Harfouche is also engraved on the oldest mosque in the city of Baalbek. Nowadays, in the city it is more frequently referred to as Al Harfouch family instead of Harfouch dynasty.However, in the local families of the bekkaa still hold Al Harfouch to their high standards as the heroic defenders of region and its people.

Directed by Edwin S. Porter, it is a satire of American activist Carrie Nation. The film portrays Nation and her followers entering and destroying a saloon. After the bartender retaliates by spraying Nation with water, policemen order them out; the identities of the actors are not known. Inspiration for the film was provided by an editorial cartoon which appeared in the New York Evening Journal. Kansas Saloon Smashers became a success upon its March release, and inspired other films about Nation to be produced by Lubin Manufacturing Company and Biograph Company. It was not the only film produced by Edison Studios to mock Nation; released the same year, Why Mr. Nation Wants a Divorce parodied the relationship between Nation and her husband. A print of the film is preserved in the Library of Congress, and it was released on DVD in 2007. Plot A bartender is working at a saloon, serving drinks to customers. After he fills a stereotypically Irish man's bucket with beer, Carrie Nation and her followers burst inside. They assault the Irish man, pulling his hat over his eyes and then dumping the beer over his head. The group then begin wrecking the bar, smashing the fixtures, mirrors, and breaking the cash register. The bartender then sprays seltzer water in Nation's face before a group of policemen appear and order everybody to leave. Production Edwin S. Porter, the film's director After American activist Carrie Nation first attacked a saloon in December 1900, silent motion pictures dealing with the subject of alcohol began to be produced, a testament to Nation's national notoriety and her influence over studios at the time. Kansas Saloon Smashers was produced by Edison Studios as a parody of Nation's crusade. Charles Musser, a film historian, writes that \\"the front page of the New York Journal was an excellent indicator of events considered worthy of the Kinetograph Department's attention throughout 1901‚Äì1902.\\" The director of Kansas Saloon Smashers was Edwin S. Porter, a projectionist who came to work for Edison as a cameraman in 1900. Eventually, Porter became the director responsible for all of Edison Studios' output. Porter based the set off of a photograph of a wrecked saloon which appeared in the Journal, while the characters and plot were based on editorial cartoons published in the paper. Porter frequently read the publication when he wanted inspiration on topics that filmgoers would be interested in. With production supervised by James H. White, Porter was assisted by George S. Fleming during the creation of Kansas Saloon Smashers. Fleming was an actor and scenic designer at Edison Studios, who had joined the studio in January 1901. Porter operated the camera for the film, and also developed the footage. Kansas Saloon Smashers marked one of the first short films to be created under Fleming and Porter's partnership. While none of the identities of the people who appeared in the picture are recorded, it is known the women in the film were played by men in drag, rendering them sexually unattractive. Kansas Saloon Smashers features stop action techniques, used to portray Nation destroying the bar; it was shot in black-and-white. A copyright was filed for the film on February 2, 1903. The finished product comprised around 60 to 65 feet (around 18 m) of 35 mm film. Kansas Saloon Smashers was not the only satire of Nation to be produced by Edison Studios. Why Mr. Nation Wants a Divorce, a comedy picture released the same year, was inspired by news articles on Nation's husband requesting a divorce. Critical analysis The complete film Kansas Saloon Smashers has been categorized as burlesque, re-enactment, and political satire. Being based on a recent news event, it is noted as helping further the \\"visual newspaper\\" style of film. The short portrays saloons as positive, sanitary places rather than immoral establishments. In Musser's book The Emergence of Cinema, he writes that \\"the women's invasion of a male refuge is seemingly attributed to sexual frustration and the concomitant need for revenge,\\" while author Karen Blumenthal opined that Kansas Saloon Smashers suggests women were only attacking due to a few miscreants being present in the establishments. Film critic Dave Kehr noted in a 2007 The New York Times article that, along with Why Mr. Nation Wants a Divorce, the film now seems dated due to the fact that \\"the evil influence of liquor is no longer the burning question it was\\". Critic Alan Scherstuhl wrote in Village Voice that the film worked as \\"evidence that the first things our visual mass-media culture sold to its audience were comic licentiousness ‚Äî and the impulse to clean such filth up.\\" Release Initially advertised as Mrs. Carrie Nation and Her Hatchet Brigade, Kansas Saloon Smashers was distributed by Edison Studios and first released on March 16, 1901. A unique publicity still was created for the film, a rare occasion at the time. Upon release, the film was screened at Bradenburgh's Ninth and Arch Street Museum in Philadelphia, where it received an entire bill. Nevertheless, the short made Nation and her followers incensed, and Nation found the view of saloons Porter's film offered to be \\"disturbing\\". The film proved to be very successful, inspiring other films about Nation to be produced by other studios; Biograph Company made Carrie Nation Smashing a Saloon in April, while Lubin Manufacturing Company had produced a film entitled Mrs. Nation and Her Hatchet Brigade by early March. Siegmund Lubin had attempted to capitalize on the success of Kansas Saloon Smashers by making a film where Nation herself appeared; when he was unable to contact her, an actress was hired to play her. Lubin arranged with a Camden bar owner to film a staged destruction scene; however, the actress proved so convincing that bystanders began to destroy the bar for real and Lubin was forced to pay up to seven hundred dollars damage. Kansas Saloon Smashers film is now in the public domain, and a paper print is preserved in the Library of Congress. This paper print was used to recover the film for a 2007 DVD release, as part of the compilation Social Issues in American Film 1900‚Äì1934. The compilation, part of the Treasures from American Film Archives produced by the National Film Preservation Foundation, features several films from the period which had particular focus on common issues at their releases. The other Edison-produced Nation film, Why Mr. Nation Wants a Divorce, is also included.

It is also present in Mauritius. The species is found in tropical shallow reefs on their upper slopes, especially in locations exposed to the action of strong waves, at depths of between . It was described by Brook in 1893. Description It occurs in either corymbose or clumped colonies and its branches are thick and non-uniform in shape and length. Branches are often globular, dome-shaped, conical or tapered. At the ends of the branches, axial corallites may be present but most specimens have some branches without axial corallites. Radial corallites are tube-shaped and irregular with spiny appearances. The species is brown or cream in colour and there are no known similar species. Distribution It is classified as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List and it is believed that its population is decreasing; the species is also listed under Appendix II of CITES. Figures of its population are unknown, but is likely to be threatened by the global reduction of coral reefs, the increase of temperature causing coral bleaching, climate change, human activity, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) and disease.

It is a more recent alternative to the WEIS coding system developed by Charles A. McClelland and the Conflict and Peace Data Bank (COPDAB) coding system developed by Edward Azar. History Work on CAMEO began in 2000 at Kansas University with financial support from the National Science Foundation. The first paper on the subject, by Deborah J. Gerner was written for the March 2002 Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association in New Orleans. In the paper, the authors noted that they worked on creating the new CAMEO system rather than continue using the existing WEIS coding system for a combination of reasons, including previously known weaknesses of WEIS and some difficulties that emerge when trying to automate the WEIS coding process. The coding software used for CAMEO, as well as for the automated WEIS implementation that CAMEO was compared with, was the Textual Analysis by Augmeted Replacement Instructions (TABARI) software developed by co-author Philip A. Schrodt in 2000, and was in turn based on the Kansas Event Data System (KEDS) developed in 1994. The CAMEO manual describes the following key stages of the history of work on the project: * Initial development of verb and actor ontology: (2000-2003): Deborah J. Gerner, Omur Yilmaz, Philip A. Schrodt * Refinements of actor ontology (2004-2007): Dennis Hermrick, Baris Kesgin, Peter Picucci, Joseph Pull, Almas Sayeed, Sarah Stacey * Organized Religion (2009-2011): Matthias Heilke * Ethnic Groups (2011): Jay Yonamine, Benjamin Bagozzi Alternatives One of the alternatives to CAMEO is Integrated Data for Events Analysis (IDEA), an outgrowth of work by the PANDA project. Predecessors to CAMEO include the World Interaction/Event Survey (WEIS) coding system by Charles A. McClelland and the Conflict and Peace Data Bank (COPDAB) by Edward Azar. Some key differences between CAMEO and IDEA are: * IDEA maintains backward compatibility with WEIS whereas CAMEO does not. * CAMEO is focused on inter-state behavior, whereas IDEA encompasses a substantially broader range of behavior. * The tertiary categories for IDEA are generally oriented towards the study of citizen direct action (for example strikes and protests), whereas the categories in CAMEO are oriented towards the study of third-party mediation in international and inter-ethnic conflict.

It can also be found in Palau and the southern Mariana Islands, the Red Sea, Mauritius, Tuha'a Pae, the Pitcairn Islands and Rodrigues. It occurs in shallow tropical reefs, in shallow protected lagoons and at lagoon entrances, to depths from 1‚Äì10 m. Description Colonies of Acropora lovelli have a branching structure and may be bluish-white with blue tips to the stubby side branches. It has been grown in mariculture. Biology Acropora lovelli is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its soft tissues. These photosynthetic organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the planktonic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps. Status Acropora lovelli is an uncommon species with a patchy distribution. It is particularly susceptible to coral bleaching and to coral diseases, as well as being prone to attack by the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci). The main threats faced by corals are related to climate change; the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats, increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and ocean acidification. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this species as being \\"vulnerable\\". All corals receive protection by being listed on CITES Appendix II.

The species also occurs in the south Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Palau, the Andaman Islands, Fiji, the Philippines, the Banggai Islands, Samoa, the Raja Ampat Islands, the Line Islands, Papua New Guinea, and the Chagos Archipelago. It exists in tropical shallow reefs on upper slopes that are exposed to the action of strong waves or currents, and subtidally on edges of reefs and in submerged reefs. It exists at depths of between and probably spawns in October. Description It is found in corymbose colonies in plate structures with tapered branches. Axial corallites are present and rounded, radial corallites are not orderly and have a variety of diameters and shapes. The species is grey, purple, or cream-brown in colour, and it looks similar to Acropora forskali. Distribution It is classed as a Near Threatened species on the IUCN Red List and it is believed that its population is decreasing; the species is also listed under Appendix II of CITES. Figures of its population are unknown, but is likely to be threatened by the global reduction of coral reefs, the increase of temperature causing coral bleaching, climate change, human activity, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) and disease.

It is also found in the Line Islands. It occurs in shallow tropical reefs on upper reef slopes, in turbid water and in sandy lagoons. It can be found from depths of 5‚Äì25 m. Description Colonies of this species are small and arborescent, usually forming thickets. The branches are slender and straight. Its colour is usually pale grey, but it is sometimes pale brown or cream. Biology Acropora microphthalma is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its soft tissues. These photosynthetic organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the planktonic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps. Status This coral is a common species and no species-specific threats have been identified. The main threats faced by corals in general are related to climate change and the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats; increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and ocean acidification. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this species as being \\"near threatened\\".

Much of his art is publicly displayed around La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he led the Downtown La Crosse Sculpture Project Committee. The La Crosse Tribune called Petersen \\"one of the premier sculptors in the Coulee Region\\" and \\"instrumental in getting public sculpture scattered throughout downtown\\" La Crosse. He has worked significantly with welding, including that of found metal objects, and often sculpted in cast bronze. While at Dana College, Petersen was drafted in the middle of his education, then returned on the GI Bill to do graduate work in art at the University of Wisconsin. Early in his career, Petersen taught at the University of Jamestown, North Dakota, where he sculpted a large buffalo that is still an important landmark of the city and the namesake of its moniker \\"Buffalo City\\". Petersen worked and taught at Texas Lutheran University before returning to Wisconsin in 1978 and opening an art studio. Petersen received thirteen awards out of 23 juried shows. In 2007, he displayed a collection at The Danish Immigrant Museum in Elk Horn, Iowa. Roger D.

Civil War  The Spanish Civil War was devastating to Figuera who lost her teaching position in 1936 because of her sympathies with Republican dissidents. Meanwhile, her husband enlisted in the Republican militias. She lamented the atmosphere of hate, retribution and injustice that became widespread in Spain during that time. With the end of hostilities, she found employment at the National Library of Madrid.  Later years  Figuera spurned the ideals of pure poetry and was the same age as members of the poetry group known as Generation of 1927 and should have been counted among them. Instead, because she did not publish until later in life, in 1948 (at about 46 years of age), she was considered a senior member of the Generation of 1936, a later group of poets. √Ångela died in Madrid on April 2, 1984, at 84 years of age. With her passing, her husband Julio began his life-long campaign to keep her work from being forgotten. Because of his insistence, in 1986, Hiperi√≥n published the first edition of the Complete Works of √Ångela Figuera Aymerich. She continued to write \\"using humble words to write on issues that are still serious today: she wrote about injustices, about freedom in the twentieth century, about freedom crushed a thousand times, about the child who died at birth, and also about women's equality and rights,\\" said Juan Mari Aburto, the mayor of Bilbao, at a dedication held at the √Ångela Figuera Institute in 2018. She has been remembered by author Jose Ram√≥n Zabala as \\"as a real hinge between Basque and Madrid cultural circles.\\"  Selected works  Here is some of her published work.

It was released in the United States on November 30, 2000 for the PlayStation and later released in Europe on January 19, 2001. Plot The chickens live peacefully in an alternate universe, where chickens are the dominant species. Mort the Chicken is the star of his own television show. In another universe, cube-like creatures called The Boolyon are spying on the chickens. The leader of the cubes, General Cubicles, notices that the chickens have stacks of hay, and Cubicles mistakes them for kidnapped citizens of their universe. While Mort is filming his own TV show, the cubes reach their universe via a dwell and kidnap all the baby chicks, scattering them across the cube universe. Mort, being the only one brave enough to stop the cubes, jumps down the dwell and starts his adventure to save the baby chicks. Gameplay Mort the Chicken is a relatively straightforward platformer. The player controls Mort as he explores his universe, rescuing baby chicks and killing cubes. Mort can destroy the cubes using the comb on his head, which can be used as a whip. Some cubes cannot be killed, and every time Mort takes a hit, the cubes steal a chick from Mort and imprison it. Mort's health bar is shown by two stalks of corn, and when Mort loses health, part of the corn disappears. Each level has up to 10 chicks to rescue. Mort can also gain power-ups. These power-ups include making him jump higher, become giant, attract chicks, extend his neck-whip attack, or have chicks attack enemies. Eggs and chicken food are scattered across the levels, and Mort can peck at these with his beak. Eggs give Mort power-ups and chicken food restores health. Reception Mort the Chicken received unfavorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

It was a developmental launch site for the silo-based Titan and Atlas missile series. The site was originally constructed for Titan I tests. On 12 December 1960, a fully fueled Titan was lifted to the surface in preparation for launch when the silo elevator collapsed. The missile fell back down into the silo and exploded, damaging the facility so badly that it was abandoned. The first launch of a silo-based missile would take place to the northwest inside the Silo Launch Test Facility (SLTF). The OSTF complex also included silos for launching Atlas E and F missiles; coffin types for the former and elevator types for the latter. Atlas testing began rather ignominiously when Missile 27E exploded at liftoff on 7 June 1961, putting OSTF-1 out of use for seven months. The facility went on to host another nine Atlas E launches before being decommissioned in 1964. Operational tests were designed as practice drills for ballistic missile crews and also engineering tests of the missile and silo equipment‚Äîthey would travel to Vandenberg Air Force Base and launch a randomly selected missile from the inventory, which was then equipped with telemetry and Range Safety destruct packages. Some launches tested reentry vehicles or Nike-Zeus target missiles. OSTF-2 hosted seven Atlas F launches between 1962 and 1965. This facility received its own baptism of fire on 4 October 1963 when Missile 45F tipped over at liftoff after one engine failed to start. Damage to the silo was not that serious and it hosted the final Atlas R&D; flight two months later. Then on 2 April 1964, a repeat disaster happened when Missile 3F failed in virtually identical fashion to 45F. This time OSTF-2 was not used again for six months, after which it hosted the finale Atlas ICBM test, Missile 106F, on 8 January 1965 and was then decommissioned from service.

In 2019, Nicholas Markets, which previously operated as part of the Foodtown chain, joined the Wakefern cooperative, switching their stores to the Fresh Grocer banner, which had become property of Wakefern when the original chain joined Wakefern, bringing the total stores under the banner to 13. History The Fresh Grocer opened in 1996 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Fresh Grocer has locations on Walnut Street and Broad Street in North Philadelphia. On August 1, 2013, The Fresh Grocer became a member of Wakefern. One of the stores was converted to the ShopRite name while the others retained the Fresh Grocer name. The Fresh Grocer Location in Wilmington, DE was closed on December 9, 2019. Expansion Wakefern members Patrick Burns and Jeff Brown will open four new Fresh Grocer stores in March 2016, all in former Pathmark stores that were purchased at auction. The stores will be opened in Wyncote, Upper Darby, Brookhaven, and Monument Avenue in Philadelphia. Since 2001, the University of Pennsylvania made efforts to remove The Fresh Grocer from its Walnut Street location. In 2017, The Fresh Grocer was asked to vacate the property after failing to renew its lease. The grocery store sued University of Pennsylvania maintaining its intention to stay at the location.

Introduction  SiCloud‚Äôs provides instructional and research web-based tools. Such interactive learning tools provide two important benefits that enhance traditional teaching methods: They can be accessed by anyone from anywhere and interactive tools engage the brain in a way different from merely reading, and so enhance and reinforce the learning experience. Silicon photonics is a platform for manufacturing low cost and high bandwidth communication components for data centers and distributed computing, storage and network systems. It has transitioned from research to industry with participation by most major semiconductor companies as well as myriad startups. Understanding this field may be challenging for researchers and students alike, as silicon photonics involves a wide range of disciplines, including material science, semiconductor physics, electronics and waveguide optics. This field has been recognized by the Forbes magazine as \\"The $100B Opportunity\\".  Features  This web-based calculator is an interactive analysis tool for optical properties of silicon and related material (, , , etc.). It is designed to be a one stop resource for students, researchers and design engineers. The first and most basic aspect of Silicon Photonics is the Material Parameters, which provides the foundation for the Device, Sub-System and System levels. In the Material Parameters tab, one may study the physical properties of the materials commonly used in silicon photonics. SiCloud includes the common dielectrics and semiconductors for waveguide core, cladding, and photodetection, as well as metals for electrical contacts. In the Main Graph, one may examine several physical parameters of interest for each material, in different wavelength ranges, and choose between frequency and free-space wavelength for convenience. SiCloud also includes citations for the original data so that users may gather the raw data and be self-assured of its accuracy and conditions. For silicon in particular, SiCloud includes a large number of parameters beyond refractive index and absorption coefficient, including the thermo-optic coefficient, Raman gain coefficient, Kerr coefficient, and two-photon absorption coefficient. One important consideration of a researcher is the optical loss in a given length of material, and so SiCloud provides a loss graph. Here, one may observe total material absorption, but also consider the reflection loss due to, e.g., coupling, for a variety of materials. With two facets we can even see Fabry- Perot resonances.  History  SiCloud was developed by UCLA graduate student Peter DeVore and a team of researchers at the Jalali-Lab. It is part of the educational effort funded by the Center for Integrated Access Networks Engineering Research Center) of NSF. It debuted at the 2014 CIAN Annual Meeting in Tucson, Arizona on May 14, 2014. SiCloud is a work in progress and its capability is being expanded.

The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1888 using designs by the architects T. Solheim and T. Tengesdal. The church seats about 500 people, which makes it the largest church in Hardanger, leading it to sometimes be called the Hardanger Cathedral (). History The first church in Jondal was a stave church that was built during the Middle Ages. The exact date of construction is not known, but historical records show that it was in use in 1309, so it must have been built sometime before that time. The old stave church was in use for centuries until it was torn down in 1725 because it was in such poor condition. A new church was built on the same site to replace the old church. This church was completed in 1726 and it was a timber framed church. That church was used until 1888 when it too was torn down to make room for the present church which is much larger. The present church was built in 1888 by the architects Solheim and Tengesdal. The white, wooden church was consecrated on 18 July 1888.

Active in the first Romanian socialist party, the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party, he became dissatisfied with the party's passivity and its failure to openly support political rights for the Romanian Jews, initiating a separate Jewish socialist group. Following the party's demise, he was one of the main activists for the revival of the socialist movement in Ia≈üi, introducing to Marxism many future leaders of the Romanian socialist parties. Sympathetic to the 1917 February Revolution, he was arrested after attempting to gain the support of Russian soldiers present in the country during World War I. Wexler was assassinated in custody shortly after, with the Romanian authorities suppressing any formal enquiry into his death. Biography =Early life and the PSDMR= Max Wexler was born in Ia≈üi, north-eastern Romania, in a family of Jewish origin. After finishing his compulsory education, having noted Romanian writer Ion CreangƒÉ as a teacher during the primary school, he enrolled in the local Superior School of Commerce, graduating as an accountant in 1899. He would later study towards becoming a candidate in philosophy and literature at the Universit√© Nouvelle, a left-wing splinter of the Free University of Brussels. Learning about socialist ideas during his commercial school years, Wexler joined the informal Socialist Party of Ia≈üi at nineteen, which was to join forces with the other socialist clubs in the nationwide Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR) in 1893. Around the same period he met Litman Ghelerter, who became a close friend and one of his principal political collaborators. Gradually becoming one of the leaders of the Ia≈üi socialists, Wexler became involved in PSDMR's national politics. In 1894, after the leadership decided to curb the radicalism of Munca, the party newspaper, by appointing moderate Ioan NƒÉdejde as editor, Wexler-led socialists authored a proposal that sought to expand the journal outreach. Among the envisioned actions were an increase in publication frequency and an expansion of discussed themes to include scientific and literary topics, news about foreign socialist movements, and articles related to the agrarian question. While the proposal was rejected, Wexler continued to press for a more militant position of the Romanian socialists. He therefore co-wrote, with L. Ghelerter, the draft for a new party statute, which was presented before the Third PSDMR Congress in April 1895. In the draft several proposals were made towards a better organization of the party, providing the formalization of local party sections and the establishment of clear duties for the party leadership and responsibilities for the various party bodies. Notable were also the provision that forbade simultaneous membership in the PSDMR and in other political organizations, and the one requiring any dispute among members to be first discussed within the party. Due to the opposition of the bourgeois members of the party leadership, the draft was rejected by the Congress, which mandated the General Council to draft a new statute project for a future Congress. Soon after, Wexler and the other socialists around the periodical Lumina emerged as a dissident group, which was eventually excluded from the party. The dissidents deplored the tactics adopted by party leadership, which in their opinion did not actively seek to increase the party's influence among the urban proletariat. Furthermore, they accused the party organ, Lumea NouƒÉ, of losing its socialist character. The break with the official party was also partly motivated by disagreement of the Lumina supporters with the formers ambiguous position towards the question of Jewish naturalization in Romania. Thus, the dissident group quickly evolved as a primarily Jewish socialist grouping, acting until 1897 as separate from the Ia≈üi Workers' Club. Beginning with 1896, the leaders of the group, Wexler, Ghelerter and Leon Gheller, also edited a Yiddish language weekly, Der Veker. As none of the editors were familiar with literary Yiddish, at first they wrote mostly in Romanian and had their articles translated by a local teacher. A labour organizer, Wexler was elected president of the Clerks' Society in 1896 and worked together with Bucharest-based VintilƒÉ Rosetti in order to obtain improvements of working conditions, such as the eight-hour day and Sunday rest. During the same period, together with Barbu BrƒÉni≈üteanu, he was a delegate to the national conference of civil servants and commerce, finance and industry clerks. =Towards the restoration of a Social Democratic Party= As the PSDMR had disbanded in 1899 in the aftermath of the defection of several of its leaders to the National Liberal Party (PNL), Wexler was one of the supporters of a renewed socialist party. Thus, between 1899 and 1900, became a regular writer for Lumea NouƒÉ, by then edited by a group of mostly proletarian socialists. Towards the same objective, in August 1903 he established the Ia≈üi Circle of Social Studies, of which he was one of the foremost lecturers, with the support of Dr. Ghelerter. Many of the students attending the Circle would later become leading figures of the Romanian socialist movement: Mihail Gheorghiu Bujor, Ion Sion, Ottoi CƒÉlin, Ilie Moscovici. Wexler's lecture topics included party tactics, the Erfurt Program, the history of Christianity and the Jewish question. During the Circle sessions he exposed A. C. Cuza's PhD thesis as a plagiarism, with many of the arguments being later presented in a book published by another member of the Circle, Emanoil Socor. Active in the Socialist Union of Romania, established in 1907, he was elected during its January 1908 conference a member in the commission tasked with revising the political program of the organization. The commission also included Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Christian Rakovsky, Mihail Gh. Bujor, N. D. Cocea and Ion Sion. Beginning with the refoundation of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) in 1910, Wexler was to become one of the main leaders of its Ia≈üi section. In 1914, together with Dr. Ghelerter, he rented a building in Ia≈üi that would serve during the following years both as their home and the headquarters of the local Social-Democratic Club and Trade Union Commission. Throughout his life, Wexler kept in contact with several luminaries of the European socialist movement of the time, such as Karl Kautsky, Max Beer, Franz Mehring, Heinrich Cunow, Georg Ledebour, Arthur Stadthagen and Rosa Luxemburg. Friend and collaborator of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, he was an active contributor to the Romanian socialist press, writing for, among others, Munca, Rom√¢nia Muncitoare (known as Lupta beginning with 1914), Lumina, Viitorul Social, Convorbiri sociale. In order to avert the anti-Jewish prejudice prevalent among the Romanian public, Wexler commonly used pseudonyms. Thus, he notably signed one of his major contribution to Romanian Marxism, The socialism in Romania published in Viitorul Social, under the name of a fellow party-member, ethnic Romanian Ion Sion. The article considers the applicability of socialist ideas in the specific context of Romanian economy, paralleling Gherea's theory about the \\"Marxism in backward countries\\". A speaker of German, French, Polish and Russian, Wexler wrote articles for Die Neue Zeit and other European socialist newspapers and magazines, also translating several socialist works into Romanian. The articles he authored dealt primarily with theoretical problems of the workers' movement, and in his writings he opposed both antisemitism and zionism. Beside his socialist activity, Wexler also published his translation of √âmile Zola's Germinal, took interest in prehistory and philology, and published works related to his professional activity, such as a study of interest rates presented at the St. Louis World's Fair. During the first decades of the twentieth century he helped smuggle over the Pruth, towards the Russian Empire, left-wing literature written in Russian, Polish and Yiddish, most of it originating in Switzerland. His frequent contacts with the Russian revolutionaries also made him a target of surveillance by the police and the Siguran≈£a. =World War I and assassination= During the internal PSD debates that followed the start of World War I, Wexler disagreed with the party's support for the resolutions of the Zimmerwald Conference. Specifically, he concluded that the call to overthrow capitalism in case of war was not applicable to Romania, which had not yet fully experienced a \\"bourgeois-democratic revolution\\". After Romania entered the war on the side of Entente, Wexler was mobilized as chief accountant and cashier in an Ia≈üi enterprise. In 1917 he welcomed the Russian February Revolution, and, along with Bujor, took part in the May Day parade organized by revolutionary Russian soldiers in the city. As a result, two days later his mobilization order was overturned and he was drafted into the active army duty, despite his age and failing health. Suspected of taking part in Rakovsky's escape during the demonstrations, he was brought under armed escort before the court martial in BacƒÉu. Briefly released and sent back to Ia≈üi, he was soon placed under the guard of the 2nd Huntsmen Regiment. There, on the night of May 14, he was sent towards the local command post, under an escort headed by Lieutenant Romalo, close friend of the Romanian heir apparent, Carol. On the way, while passing through a forest, Wexler was shot in the back of his head by one of the guards, ostensibly because he was attempting to escape custody. According to the socialist press, his assassination had been planned by the military authorities with the acknowledgement of the PNL leadership, and his killer was rewarded with a bottle of rum, an insignificant amount of money, and promotion to the rank of sergeant. Wexler's death was followed by public outcry, leading to agitation among the Russian soldiers present on Romanian territory and bringing the attention of the Petrograd government. Summoned by the Russian envoy to Romania, prime-minister Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu expressed regret about the death, undertook to suspend the application of the death penalty, and promised a thorough investigation will take place. War minister VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu sent two letters to the General Headquarters requesting further research into the matter, also enquiring whether the shooting was deliberate or was the result of a misinterpretation of orders. Nevertheless, no formal inquiry was ever started into the death of Wexler. According to the memories of Gheorghe Gh. M√¢rzescu, member of the government at the time, the story of an attempted escape had been proven false, but the investigation was suppressed following the intervention of Romalo's father, the physician of the Romanian royal family. As late as 1922, the whereabouts of Wexler's remains were unknown.

History William Botterill came to Hull in 1848 as clerk of works for the new Royal Station Hotel and set up an architectural practice in 1851. His son William Henry (1851‚Äì79) was also a partner in his practice. John Bilson,Bilson is better known for his work as an historian of medieval architecture and is considered one authority on Cistertian architecture. (See main article John Bilson (architect)) trained at the practice and became a partner in 1881. Botterill's son William Henry died early in 1879 and Bilson subsequently became the main partner in the practice, taking over the business when Botterill retired in 1899. The firm's commissions included chapels, houses, banks, offices, industrial buildings: commissions included the schools for the Hull School Board, with Botterill initially producing gothic revival designs, and later designs in the Queen Anne revival style by Bilson. Botterill designed the Newland Park Estate in Hull in 1877, though most of its houses were developed after his death. Oriel Chambers (now the home of the Wilberforce Institute for the study of Slavery and Emancipation) were built in 1879.

History =Foundation= In 2003, Virgin Money was launched in Australia with the launch of Virgin Money credit cards. Virgin Money Australia initially launched in partnership with Macquarie Bank Pty Ltd, followed by Westpac under a five-year agreement. =First products= It added superannuation (2005) and home loans (2008) to their product suite. The card was Australia's first no annual fee credit card. The card was marketed as a cheaper option to most other credit cards with up to 55 interest-free days and an interest rate of 12.99% (April 2007). Customers were entitled to offers through the credit card's ‚ÄòMates rates‚Äô scheme, which included offers from other Virgin companies in Australia such as Virgin Blue, Virgin Mobile and Virgin Atlantic. A comprehensive restaurant discount scheme, operated by the Entertainment Book company, was also available. The Virgin Credit Card was withdrawn from sale in Australia as of 3 April 2008 after the five-year agreement with Westpac came to an end. Customers could continue to use their cards as normal, but no new Virgin credit cards could be issued. When a customer's card expired, they were transitioned to the ‚ÄòIgnite‚Äô card by Westpac. =Buy-back by Virgin Group= At the time of Virgin Money's launch in Australia the group company that combined the UK and Australian operations was co-owned by Virgin Group and HHG. In 2004 100% ownership of that UK/Australia group company was acquired by Virgin Group for Aus. $219 million. =Changes to product ranges= In 2008, Virgin Money Australia withdrew its home loan product from the Australian market due to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 and the credit cards portfolio was transferred to its supplier, Westpac Banking Corporation, after the end of a 5-year agreement. In 2009, Virgin Money launched car insurance, partnering with A&G; Insurance Services and also announced their strategic alliance with CitiBank, with plans to launch a suite of retail banking services in 2010. =Virgin Money credit cards= Virgin Money credit cards were relaunched in Australia on 27 July 2010 with two card types: the Velocity Rewards Credit Card, co-branded with Velocity Frequent Flyer, and the No Annual Fee Credit Card. All credit cards are also co-branded with Visa credit card. =Purchase by Bank of Queensland= In 2013 Virgin Money Australia was bought by Bank of Queensland for $40 million. Under the deal, Bank of Queensland have rights to the Virgin Money name in Australia for four decades while paying royalties to the Virgin Group, and Virgin has a seat on the board of Bank of Queensland.

Filename extensions for Motion JPEG 2000 video files are .mj2 and .mjp2, as defined in RFC 3745.  ISO Standards  MJ2, first defined by Part 3 of the ISO Standard for JPEG 2000 ISO/IEC 15444 in November 2001 (ISO/IEC 15444-3:2002) as a standalone document, has later been defined by ISO/IEC 15444-3:2007, ISO/IEC 15444-3:2007/Amd 1:2010, additional profiles for archiving applications, and by ISO/IEC 15444-12 which defines the JPEG 2000 base media format, which contains the timing, structure, and media information for timed sequences of media data. The standard is available for download from ITU-T as their Recommendation T.802.  MPEG vs MJ2  Motion JPEG2000 was always intended to coexist with MPEG. Unlike MPEG, MJ2 does not implement inter-frame coding; each frame is coded independently using JPEG 2000. This makes MJ2 more resilient to propagation of errors over time, more scalable, and better suited to networked and point-to-point environments, with additional advantages over MPEG with respect to random frame access, but at the expense of increased storage and bandwidth requirements.  History  From 1997 to 2000, the JPEG 2000 image compression standard was developed by a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) committee chaired by Swiss-Iranian engineer Touradj Ebrahimi (later the JPEG president). In contrast to the original 1992 JPEG standard, which is a discrete cosine transform (DCT) based lossy compression format for static digital images, JPEG 2000 is a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based compression standard that could be adapted for motion imaging video compression with the Motion JPEG 2000 extension. JPEG 2000 technology was later selected as the video coding standard for digital cinema in 2004.

Today they are electrically powered and known as scroll saws, and have been largely displaced by portable power jigsaws. Jigsaws first emerged in the 19th centuryOnline Etymological Dictionary and employed a treadle to operate the blade. The modern portable jigsaw was introduced in 1947 by Scintilla AG (later acquired by Bosch) .Bosch Media Service A jigsaw power tool is a jigsaw made up of an electric motor and a reciprocating saw blade. Jigsaws with sole plates that have a beveling function can cut angles typically up to 45 degrees relative to the normal vertical stroke to make miter joints. In the past, what are now usually called scroll saws were often referred to as jigsaws. History In 1946 Albert Kaufmann, an engineer of Scintilla AG company in Solothurn, Switzerland, replaced the needle on his wife's sewing machine with a saw blade.Bosch Media ServiceInvention of the Jigsaw In 1947, after development of Kaufmann's invention, Scintilla started producing jigsaws under name \\"Lesto jigsaw\\". In 1954 Scintilla was acquired by Bosch and in 1964 the name \\"Lesto\\" was replaced with Bosch. Blades A Jigsaw works by attaching a blade accessory to the tool. There are various types of blades in the market. Older jigsaws require a blade to be screwed into the tool. But since Bosch introduced the first tool- free blade change system, most manufacturers now offer a similar setup allowing a quick & tool-free blade change. There are T-shank blades and U-shank blades available in the accessory market. T-Shank blades are the industry-standard professional interface that provides a longer life and a tighter fit from the blade to the tool. Tooth design is important for the performance of a blade. The tooth spacing, tooth shape, and cutting angle are important in providing speed, cleanliness of cuts, and optimal performance. A side set and ground tooth is designed for clean and fast cuts in wood and plastics. Wavy set and milled teeth will cut most metals as well as aluminum and plastics. A side set and milled tooth works with fast and rougher cuts in wood and plastics. A ground and taper ground tooth is for very precise, fine and clean cuts in wood. There is also reduced-kerf carbide and diamond grit edges for fast cutting in hard materials. Blade material Different blade materials are used for different applications to improve blade life and cutting performance. High-carbon steel (HCS) is used for softer materials such as wood, laminated particle board, and plastics due to its flexibility. High- speed steel (HSS) is a stronger steel that can cut all types of metals. Bi- Metal (BIM) blades contain a combination of high-carbon steel and high-speed steel. The combination creates a strong and flexible material that can be used for demanding applications where there is a risk of breakage or when extreme flexibility and versatility is required. Bi-Metal blades have longer lifespans and prolonged job performance compared to other types of blades. Tungsten carbide (TC) blades have the strength to cut through abrasive metals such as reinforced plastics, fiberglass, cement board, stainless steel, tile, glass, cast iron, and brick. Diamond-grit blades are extremely versatile, as they can cut rough materials such as hard porcelain tile, granite, slate, marble, and other stones. due to their finely milled particles. This makes their uses similar to carbide blades, although diamond-grit blades typically last longer. Controllability Control is an issue with jigsaws; the blades are small and weak, with the lower end entirely unsupported. Good cut control requires the presence of blade rollers, which keep the blade aligned just above the sole plate. In addition, heavy-cast sole plate saws are somewhat better than pressed steel for sawing line control. To guide a jigsaw on curved cut, it must be steered (turned) and not forced to move sideways. The use of sharp blades is important as well to get high quality cuts.

The center was originally at Yale University and known as the Yale Center of Alcohol Studies, before it moved to Rutgers in 1962. The CAS is also home to the peer-reviewed Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs (JSAD), the oldest journal on alcohol studies; and a library of alcohol literature. Early research in the 1940s at the CAS helped support the disease model of addiction that helped change public perception on alcohol consumption. History The CAS was the first research institute dedicated to alcohol studies after the 21st amendment to the U.S. Constitution repealed prohibition in 1933. The center was founded at Yale as a research area in the Applied Physiology department in 1935. E. Morton Jellinek was Director of the Center until the 1950s, and stepped down when he was offered a position at the World Health Organization. He was replaced by Selden D. Bacon. The Yale Center of Alcohol Studies opened the first Summer School of Alcohol Studies in 1943, and in 1944 opened a free clinic devoted to treating alcoholism. The Summer School still continues every year. The CAS at Yale funded the early years of the National Council on Alcoholism (NCA; now known as the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, NCAAD). In the 1960s, there was a new President at Yale. Around this time, the Yale Corporation voted to move the Center to a new location, negotiating mainly with Brown, Columbia and Rutgers University. The center moved to Rutgers University in 1962, with financial assistance from the National Institutes of Health and philanthropist Christopher D. Smithers. Biochemist David Lester was appointed scientific director of the CAS after it moved to Rutgers. In 1964, the Center moved again to Smithers Hall, where the CAS is located today. Interest in Alcohol studies increased in the United States in the 1970s. On December 1970, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAA) was created as part of the National Institutes of Health. The NIAA began to fund research at the CAS in the 1970s.

Haggard in 1940 founded the Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol, the oldest journal on alcohol/addiction studies. The journal published both original research and abstracts from other sources. In 1941, Jellinek was managing editor of the journal. For several years Mark Keller was editor of the Quarterly from 1959 to 1977 and was named editor emeritus after his retirement. The Mark Keller Award was created in his honor for the best article in the journal. Timothy Coffey succeeded Keller. The journal was later renamed the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and became a monthly publication in 1975. Again the journal was renamed to the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. It is currently a bimonthly publication. Library =Classified Abstract Archive of the Alcohol Literature= The Classified Abstract Archive of the Alcohol Literature (CAAAL) is a special collection of abstracts by CAS staff from 1938 through 1977 of the scientific and scholarly alcohol literature. Jellinek was the original executive director. Publication ceased in 1978. =Donations= The Center has received several donations, including the Connor Alcohol Research Reference Files (CARRF).

He assumed his seat in January 2015. Background The son of William Patterson \\"Pat\\" Flippo and Katherine W. Flippo of Mountain Home in Baxter County, Flippo is a 1998 graduate of Mountain Home High School and a 2003 alumnus in business administration of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He is a native and resident of Mountain Home and the owner of Flippo's Carefree Living, an assisted living facility in Bull Shoals in Marion County. Political life In the runoff election held on June 10, 2014, Flippo defeated the District 98 State Representative John Burris of Harrison, 3,913 (51.3 percent) to 3,712 (48.7 percent). With no Democratic opponent in the heavily Republican district in the November 4 general election, Flippo became both the Republican nominee and the Senator-elect to succeed fellow Republican Johnny Key, also of Mountain Home, who has applied for a position as vice chancellor of governmental affairs with the University of Arkansas. Burris had led the primary election balloting on May 20 with 43 percent of the vote, barely ahead of Flippo, who polled 42 percent. A third candidate, David Osmon, the mayor of Mountain Home, held the remaining but critical 16 percent of the votes cast. Burris was the leading spokesman for the state's \\"private option\\" Medicaid expansion proposal, which he had considered essential to keeping open rural hospitals in Arkansas. Under the plan, federal Medicaid funds are earmarked to purchase health insurance for the 170,000 indigent persons in Arkansas. Osmon also supports the private option plan. Flippo carried the backing of several Republican lawmakers who oppose the \\"private option\\" championed by Burris. One of those lawmakers is outgoing District 21 Representative Terry Rice of Waldron, who unseated District 9 Senator Bruce Holland in the Republican runoff primary. Another surrogate for the Flippo campaign was Curtis Coleman, an opponent of the private option plan who lost the Republican gubernatorial nomination to Asa Hutchinson in 2014. Coleman carried only Flippo's Baxter County in his race against Hutchinson. Flippo, who calls himself conservative, said of his opponent Burris: \\"He is the architect and leader of bringing Obamacare to Arkansas through the private option. He voted to implement Common Core standards in Arkansas. He ... proposed doubling legislative salaries. He has consistently ranked in the top 10 in receiving reimbursements since taking office. These are all facts, and these are the distinctions in our campaigns.\\"  References  Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:Arkansas state senators Category:People from Mountain Home, Arkansas Category:People from Marion County, Arkansas Category:Businesspeople from Arkansas Category:University of Arkansas alumni Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Scott Flippo"},{"id":"43113226","text":"Goodgame Studios is an online games company founded in 2009 and based in Hamburg, Germany, and part of the Stillfront Group since 2018.http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/stillfront-group-ab-stillfront- completes-the-acquisition-of-goodgame-studios-20180115-00394 The company has created or acquired the rights to eight games, including Goodgame Empire, Jump Jupiter, Goodgame Big Farm, Goodgame Galaxy, Goodgame Hercules, Goodgame Gangster, Goodgame Disco, Goodgame Caf√®, Goodgame Farmer, Goodgame Farmfever, Goodgame Fashion, Goodgame Poker, Shadow Kings: Dark Ages, Legends of Honor, and Infernals.

It was located at 740 North La Cienega Boulevard, across the street from the noted Ferus Gallery. Curator Henry Hopkins, who founded the gallery, named it after the French decadent novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans.Bradnock, Lucy. \\"Name Games\\". In The gallery showcased the works of several young artists who later had great success, including Joe Goode, Ed Ruscha, and Larry Bell. War Babies exhibition The gallery's most famous exhibition, War Babies, ran from May 29, 1961 to June 17, 1961. It showed the work of Goode, Bell, Ed Bereal, and Ron Miyashiro, all of whom were born in the late 1930s and experienced World War II in their early childhood. According to Hopkins, \\"the exhibition title was selected by Goode to establish a birth point in time and to indicate a sense of post-war internationalism.\\" War Babies was one of the earliest racially integrated exhibitions and \\"was a daring challenge to the prevailing norms and mores of postwar America and its underlying racial stereotypes and identity politics.\\" The participating artists played off the work of the nearby Ferus artists. Goode contributed thickly painted images of stars along with a cardboard box nailed to the gallery wall, Miyashiro contributed paintings suggestive of sinister eroticism, Bereal contributed leather pouches that stank of oil, and Bell contributed a \\"saddle painting\\". The mix of styles present in the exhibition was indicative of the fluidity of the Los Angeles art scene in the early 1960s. The exhibition's poster, created by Jerry McMillan and Joe Goode, ultimately attracted more attention than the exhibition itself. It depicted the four participating artists seated at a table covered with an American flag as a tablecloth. Each of the artists was posed with a prop playing off an ethnic or religious stereotype: Bell (Jewish) held a bagel, Bereal (African American) held a watermelon, Miyashiro (Japanese American) held chopsticks, and Goode (Catholic) held a mackerel. Liberals and conservatives alike criticized the poster; the John Birch Society denounced the gallery for flag desecration.

Started in 1894, the department has two stations used to provide fire fighting and emergency medical services to both the city and the Forest Grove Rural Fire Protection District. The department also provides administrative support to the neighboring Cornelius Fire Department. History Forest Grove started a volunteer fire department on February 4, 1894, with combination of two fire companies. The department was created after bucket brigades were determined to be inefficient, and the two fire companies spent too much time fighting each other. One of the first chiefs was J. G. Lenneville, who was first elected to the post in 1901, and served through at least 1923. In December 1907, the city purchased a hose wagon for $100. The city replaced the fire bell that had been housed at a church and at the Old College Hall at Pacific University with an electric siren in October 1925. A 1907 steamer used by the Portland Fire Bureau was bought by Forest Grove in 1933 for $150, and is still owned by the fire department. In 1956, the Forest Grove Rural Fire Protection District merged into Forest Grove Fire Department. Following the May 1980 eruptions of Mount St. Helens, the city used the department to clean the ash off of city streets. As of 1980, the Rural District covered and paid 39% of the combined entities' costs, though split capital expenditures at 50-50. At that time the combined department had 11 paid and 45 volunteer firefighters. One of the largest fires in the city came on July 14, 1982, when four downtown stores were burned, which required four alarms to contain. Firefighters from Gaston, Banks, Hillsboro, Cornelius, and Washington County Fire District 2 all helped put out the fire that caused $800,000 in damage. By 1983 the Rural District had shrunk to with 6,000 residents. The department converted an old 1973 Seagrave into a new pumper truck in 1984, saving $40,000 over buying a new piece of apparatus. The Spring Break Quake in 1993 damaged the main fire station on Ash Street in downtown, which was later repaired. In late 2006 and early 2007 the department was surrounded by turmoil concerning then chief Bob Mills as well as forgeries by Gary Clay Davis on fire inspection reports. The city was contracted by neighboring Cornelius in 2010 to provide administrative support to that city's combined city and rural fire department. In 2012, the department added living quarters to Station 7 in Gales Creek. Apparatus and stations Main station on Ash Street The department maintains two stations. The main station is located in downtown Forest Grove on Ash Street, which also houses the 1907 American LaFrance steamer. A second station is located in rural Gales Creek west of the city. The Gales Creek station, number 7, is staffed entirely by volunteers. Organization Forest Grove Fire is led by Fire Chief Michael Kinkade. The service area for the rural district includes the communities of Gales Creek, Dilley, and Verboort. For 2013, the Department had a total of 3,307 service calls, of which 2,297 were for emergency medical services and only 110 for fires. Of the 3,307 total calls, 2,794 were in the City of Forest Grove, while 408 were in the Rural Protection District.

Mortimer Luddington Menpes Life Born at Ovenden, Yorkshire, on 17 May 1841, George Barnett Smith was the son of Titus and Mary Smith. He was educated at the British Lancastrian school in Halifax, then traveled to London where he worked as a journalist. From 1865 to 1868 Smith was on the editorial staff of The Globe, and from 1868 to 1876 on that of The Echo. He was subsequently a contributor to The Times. With literary tastes and poetical ambition, Smith managed to become a contributor to the major magazines, among them the Edinburgh Review, the Fortnightly Review, and the Cornhill Magazine. In 1889 lung trouble forced Smith to leave London for Bournemouth, and for the rest of his life he was an invalid. A Conservative government granted him a civil list pension in 1891, and a Liberal government increased it in 1906. Writing to the last, he died at Bournemouth on 2 January 1909, and was buried in the cemetery there. Works Smith made a reputation as author with a series of biographies, the first of which dealt with Percy Bysshe Shelley (1877). A strong liberal in politics, he was more successful in his Life of W. E. Gladstone (1879; 14th edit. 1898), and in his Life and Speeches of John Bright (1881). There followed popular lives of Victor Hugo (1885), Queen Victoria (1886; new edit. 1901), and the German Emperor William I (1887). His most ambitious publication, History of the English Parliament (2 vols. 1892), occupied him five years. Among his other works were: * Poets and Novelists, 1875. * English Political Leaders, 1881. * Women of Renown, 1893. * Noble Womanhood, 1894. * The United States, 1897. * Canada, 1898. * Heroes of the Nineteenth Century, 3 vols. 1899-1901. * The Romance of the South Pole, 1900. Smith published under the pseudonym of Guy Roslyn three volumes of verse and George Eliot in Derbyshire (1876). He was a contributor to the early volumes of the Dictionary of National Biography, and his article on Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the ninth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1876) earned him the friendship of Robert Browning. Some of Smith's work were included in English Etchings (1884‚Äì87). Family Smith was twice married: (1) to Annie Hodson (died 1868); (2) in 1871, to Julia Timmis, who survived him. He had four daughters, of whom two survived him.

Since the 1990s, Fisher has also been producing paintings and installation works. His work has been included in three Whitney Biennial exhibitions, 1985, 2004 and 2014. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1987. Fisher's work has been noted for its relationship to the Southern California landscape and its architecture during a time when the region was staking an aesthetic and intellectual claim in the larger art world. Curator and critic Stuart Comer writes, \\"Windshields, billboards, movie screens, ocean views, econ-o-box apartment buildings and long expanses of asphalt and concrete form a unique Angeleno vocabulary of monochrome surfaces on which the symbolic configuration called California is played out. This seemingly limitless expanse of flat planes is the arena in which Fisher has staked his challenge to existing regimes of representation and narrative.\\" Early life and education Fisher majored in Art History at Harvard University (1960‚Äì1964) before moving to the West Coast. He attended USC from 1964 to 1965, and worked toward an MFA in the Motion Picture Division at UCLA the following year. Work After ending his studies, Fisher worked in the Hollywood film industry, working in support roles on projects by low-budget master Roger Corman and Haskell Wexler. Between 1968 and 1974, he created ten of his own films. His 1984 16 mm film, Standard Gauge,\\"Standard Gauge\\" was widely acclaimed, and inspired the title for his 2005 exhibition at the Whitney Museum. Fisher cites visual artists, such as Sol LeWitt and Andy Warhol, as influences. His most recent film, ( ), consists of a series of inserts‚Äîshots from an alternate angle, usually of details, actions, or objects that clarify the action of the main shots‚Äîharvested from 16 mm commercial films and assembled according to a system influenced by LeWitt, allowing the order of the shots to be determined by this system. Fisher explains in the film's program notes: \\"A rule, or a method, underlies ( ), and I have obeyed it, even if the rule and my obedience to it are not visible.\\" Fisher's work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France; FRAC Ile-de-France, Paris, France; Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, California; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, California; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden; Deutsche Kinemathek, Berlin, Germany; and Generali Foundation, Vienna, Austria.

It operated from 1907 to 1968. History The Copper Country Limited crossing the Portage Lake Lift Bridge in 1967 According to historian Jim Scribbins the name \\"Copper Country Limited\\" was first used in March 1907 to describe an existing Chicago‚ÄìChampion, Michigan‚ÄìCalumet service which had run since 1899. The DSS&A; handled the train north of Champion. The train operated overnight in both directions. With the arrival of the Chippewa-Hiawatha on the Milwaukee Division during May 1938, the Copper Country Limited took a back seat on the Milwaukee Road's trains to Upper Michigan. During 1958, the through Sault Ste. Marie sleeper was discontinued entirely after several cutbacks leaving only the sleeper to Calumet. As ridership continued to slide the Milwaukee offered the sleeper only three days a week beginning in the spring of 1964. During its final years, the Copper Country carried only a few cars. Its existence persisted almost entirely because of the lucrative U.S. mail contracts that kept many similar trains running across the country. The Copper Country Limited lost its mail car in October 1967. With little reason to keep it and few riders remaining, the train made its last runs on March 7, 1968. Timetable The summer of 1967 timetable shows the northbound Copper Country Limited leaving Chicago at 7:25 p.m., arriving at Milwaukee at 8:50 p.m., leaving Milwaukee at 9:20 p.m, stopping at Green Bay from 12:20 a.m. to 12:55 a.m. and arriving at Champion, Michigan at 6:45 a.m. On Soo Line Railroad tracks, the Copper Country Limited left Champion at 7:20 a.m. and arrived in Calumet, Mich. at 10:05 a.m. The train made 31 stops in the 424 miles between Chicago and Calumet. The southbound Copper Country Limited left Calumet at 5 p.m., stopped at Champion from 7:40 to 7:50 p.m., Green Bay from 1:15 to 1:45 a.m., Milwaukee from 5:15 to 6:05 a.m. and arrived at Chicago at 7:45 a.m. The route had 31 stops between Calumet and Chicago. Equipment In steam days, the Copper Country Limited was hauled by non-streamlined Pacific 4-6-2 steam locomotives.

Life  He was the only son of sculptor Albert Wolff of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. From 1871 to 1875, he studied at the Prussian Academy of Art under Eduard Daege, followed by study trips to Vienna and Italy. His training was completed in his father's studio. In 1880, his figure group \\"Theseus Finden die Waffen Seines Vaters\\" (Theseus Finding His Father's Weapons) brought him a scholarship to Paris. From 1882 to 1883, he was in Rome and established his own studio upon returning to Berlin. The late 1890s proved to be a hard time for artists and his financial distress was relieved only when he was given a commission to work on the Kaiser's Siegesallee (Victory Avenue) project, possibly based on his father's reputation. His work earned him the Order of the Crown, Fourth Class. Although he became very successful afterward, he never grew beyond the Academic style taught to him by his father.

She won four minor races as a two-year-old in 1977 before emerging as a top-class performer in the following year. As a three-year-old, she won the Tote Free Handicap before winning the Guineas as a 16/1 outsider. She went on to win the Fen Ditton Stakes when conceding weight to colts and older horses and then took the Strensall Stakes. She was exported to race in the United States but failed to reproduce her European form. After her retirement from racing, she had some success as a broodmare. Background Mrs McArdy was a \\"shapely, attractive\\" bay mare with a large white star bred by Christopher Beckett, 4th Baron Grimthorpe at his Westow Hall stud near York. She was arguably the best horse sired by Tribal Chief, a sprinter who won the New Stakes and the Norfolk Stakes as a two-year-old in 1969. Her dam, Hanina, was a poor racehorse but was a granddaughter of Star of India, the outstanding British two-year-old of 1955. In 1975, Lord Grimthorpe sold all his bloodstock, with most being bought by trainer Mick Easterby. Easterby sold the horses on but kept Mrs McArdy and trained at her at his farm near Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire. He later sold the filly privately to Edith Kettlewell, the wife of a hotelier. Racing career =1976: two-year-old season= Campaigned exclusively in the North of England, Mrs McArdy made little impact in the earliest part of her racing career, finishing unplaced in her first four races before winning a maiden race over five furlongs at Newcastle Racecourse. She then made steady improvement, winning a nursery handicap race over six furlongs at Thirsk and the Prince of Wales's Nursery over a mile at Doncaster, receiving fifteen pounds from the runner-up, Fair Season. On her final appearance of the season, she took her winning run to four with a victory in a minor race over six furlongs at Redcar Racecourse in September, beating Sarasingh by three quarters of a length. =1977: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Mrs McArdy finished unplaced in the seven furlong Tote Spring Handicap at Doncaster in March. She began to show good form in training gallops, however, and was strongly fancied when she ran in the Tote Free Handicap at Newmarket Racecourse in April. Carrying 112 pounds and ridden by the lightweight jockey Taffy Thomas, she won by two and a half lengths from the colts Baudelaire and Brighthelmstone. Two weeks later, Mrs McArdy, ridden by Eddie Hide, started at odds of 16/1 for the 165th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. Cloonlara, the leading two-year-old filly of 1976, started 6/4 favourite, with the other leading contenders appearing to be Freeze The Secret, Sanedtki, Flota Armada, River Dane, Icena, Miss Pinkie, and Danseuse Etoile. Durtal, regarded as the best British filly of her generation, was withdrawn on the eve of the race. Hide tracked Cloonlara before sending Mrs McArdy into the lead two furlongs from the finish. Mrs McArdy established a decisive advantage and was never seriously challenged in the closing stages, winning by two lengths from Freeze The Secret, with Sanedtki narrowly beating Cloonlara for third. Mrs McArdy was then moved up in distance to contest the Oaks Stakes over one and a half mile at Epsom Downs Racecourse in June. As she was the daughter of a sprinter, there was serious doubt about her ability to stay the distance. She was in contention until early in the straight but then rapidly faded and finished thirteenth of the fourteen runners behind Dunfermline. Unusually for a British classic winner, Mrs McArdy was then asked to concede weight to colts and older horses in a handicap race (the Fen Ditton Stakes) over a mile at Newmarket in July. Carrying 133 pounds, she took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two and a half lengths. Timeform described her performance as \\"a striking achievement\\". Mrs McArdy became agitated before the start of the Sussex Stakes at Goodwwod Racecourse and failed to reproduce her best form, finishing sixth behind Artaius. In August, the filly was assigned top weight in the Strensall Stakes over seven furlongs at York Racecourse. She took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by a length and a half from the Molecomb Stakes winner Be Easy, despite being eased down by Eddie Hide in the closing stages. On her final appearance of the season, she finished third to Boldboy in the Sanyo Stakes over seven furlongs at Doncaster in September. Later career In December 1977, Mrs McArdy was sent to the Tattersalls horses-in-training sale and was bought for 154,000 guineas by Bertram R. Firestone and exported to race in the United States. The price was a record for the sale. Mrs McArdy ran five times in North America, failing to win and finishing second once before being retired from racing. Assessment In 1976, the independent Timeform organisation gave Mrs McArdy a rating of 103, twenty-seven pounds below their top-rated two-year-old filly, Cloonlara. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain in 1976, the filly was assigned a weight of 105 pounds, 28 pounds below the top colt, J. O. Tobin, and fifteen pounds below the leading filly, Durtal. In the following year, she was given a rating of 123 by Timeform, fourteen pound behind their top-rated horse, Alleged, and ten pounds below their leading three-year-old filly, Dunfermline. In the official International Classification for three-year-olds, she was rated thirteen pounds behind Alleged and five pounds inferior to leading fillies Dunfermline and Madelia. In their book A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Mrs McArdy an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record Mrs McArdy was based as a broodmare in Europe for several years before being exported to Japan. She died at the Taiki Farm in Japan on 5 August 1991.

Life and Education Olivia Anna Schnitzler was born on 2 April 1988 in Opole, Poland and raised in Black Forest, South Germany. Olivia graduated from Gymnasium am Hoptb√ºhl, VS in 2004. She went on to study Film Studies, English Philology and Comparative Literature at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, which she finished with Bachelor of Arts in 2008. On April 7th 2018, she announced on Facebook, that she also earned her Master¬¥s Degree in Film Studies. One year later, she also announced that she finished an education as a film and video editor in Berlin. From early childhood, Olivia showed a great interest in art and literature, yet especially music and motion picture. At age 16, she made a Holocaust-shortfilm based on Janusz Korczak's \\"Ghetto Diaries\\", called Unbetitelt (which won her several festival-appearances and awards ).  Musical career  In 2009, Olivia began her career as a professional musician. She released her demo The Smiling Face of Progress and made two internet-videos: Tennis Rackets (from Girl vs. City) and Hologram (stop motion-animation-video). In order to fund the financing of her debut-album, she took part in a music talent-show on Polish television in 2011. Her appearance caused a hype and frenzy on the internet and throughout the media, with journalists and audiences often referring to her as a musical \\"epiphany\\". Her videos Tennis Rackets and Hologram, as well as live-videos were watched altogether more than 300.000 times. A 2014-video-re-upload of her TV-performance of Tel Aviv (originally from 2011) generated more than 130.000 clicks. Demo-versions of songs were shared by fans on myspace and youtube. In November 2011, the 9 track-concept- album The Name Of This Girl Is was released. It was written, arranged and produced by Livki and mixed by Patrick Dillett and Ron Allaire. On the album and its artwork, Olivia also collaborated with Scottisch drummer Robin Thomson and graphic novelist Iain Sommerville. Livki designed the artwork (containing drawings by Sommerville) which shows characters from her songs, but also quotes movies, TV shows and themes of modern lifestyle and pop culture. The album was released on her own label L I V V and sold through her internet- shop. It was critically well received. Journalist Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska praises the artist and The Name of This Girl Is in her book Bomba. Alfabet polskiego szolbiznesu ( The facto 2013 ) .

According to Destatis, 107,755 American citizens lived in Germany in 2013, and about 324,000 people with American ancestry. At the same time, more than 40,000 members of the US military and 15,000 civilian employees of American citizenship are permanently in Germany, with a strong presence in Kaiserslautern, which in the 1950s became the largest US military community outside of the United States. In addition, there are significant numbers of American expatriates in Germany, especially professionals sent abroad by their companies and an increasing number of college students and graduates (also due to the affordable higher education system and the favorable quality of life). By December 2013, the largest American diasporas in Germany are Berlin with over 16,000 people, and the area around Darmstadt with about 13,000 people.Europe Online Magazine, 25 June 2014 Military backgrounds American Zone in Germany after 8 June 1947. Mainly today's state areas of Bavaria, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Hesse and Rhineland- Palatinate were afftected, as well as city states Berlin (West Berlin) and Bremen. A large portion of the American-German population has a military background. Great numbers of American soldiers were stationed in Germany after World War II. The Occupation statute of 1949 set regulations for the post-war time within Allied-occupied Germany. Numerous American military installations were established during this time, and eventually hundreds were in place, mainly in Southern Germany. At the time of German Reunification in 1990, there were still about 200,000 US soldiers in Germany. By 2014, the number had been steadily reduced to 42,450 stationed in 38 facilities. During World War II General Dwight D. Eisenhower and the American War Department enforced a strict non-fraternization policy regarding contact between American military personnel and German citizens. After the war this prohibition was mitigated in several steps and finally abandoned in Austria and Germany in September 1945. In the earliest stages of the Allied occupation US soldiers were not allowed to pay maintenance for a child they admitted having fathered, since to do so was considered as \\"aiding the enemy\\". Marriages between white American soldiers and German women were not permitted until December 1946.

History Tepper, along with Diesel Only's cofounders, Jay Sherman-Godfrey and Albert Caiati, originally started the label with the goal of releasing vinyl 45s for use in jukeboxes at truck stops. Tepper also started the label with the goal of releasing his own band's albums, as well as those by other young bands from New York City. The first non-vinyl record the label released was 1992's Rig Rock Jukebox, which was also their first singles compilation album. Also that year, the label released a single by Mark Brine entitled \\"New Blue Yodel,\\" which, after Brine sent it to Hank Snow, landed him a gig at the Grand Ole Opry that July. By the end of 1993, Diesel Only had released more than 30 records by artists from all across the United States. The label did not become well-known until 1996, when its third singles compilation album, \\"Rig Rock Deluxe\\", was released, as part of a deal with Upstart Records. The album included songs by Buck Owens, Steve Earle, and Marty Stuart, and won Americana Album of the Year from the National Association of Independent Record Distributors.

Born  # Word mukguhar came from \\"Guhan\\" The Hunter King ‚Äì The Controller Of The Banks Of Ganges With Thousands Of Boats. # Mukguhar are the King people Who help Guhan The Hunter King according to Kamba ramayanam, Guhan is known as Kevat in north India . Kamban describes Guhan that he can see ( night vision ‚Äì he had animal instincts ) in the night in the darkest and densest of jungles and can kill any wild animal faster than its reaction ‚Äì is quicker than a leopard, has the power of the Lion, reflexes of a tiger and strength of an elephant with his sharp knife and swift that makes him a dangerous hunter but with the knowledge and compassion of a human.  Guhan  Guha (Sanskrit: ‡§ó‡•Å‡§π), is another name of the Hindu deity Skanda or Muruga. Guhan means the resident of the \\"cave of the heart\\". This meaning is derived from the Hindu philosophy that the ultimate truth/reality (God) is ever present in the hearts of all living beings and is also the cause of the life force. Guhan is commonly associated with Lord Subrahmanya, one of the most revered deities of Tamil Hindus. Guha is also encountered in one of the epic stories of Hindus. Guha, as proper noun, appears in \\"Ramayana\\" which is one of the two Hindu epics, as a boatsman. Guha assists Rama (reincarnation of Lord Vishnu) to cross the river during Rama's banishment from Ayodhya by his stepmother. Guha is revered for his high-standing honorable qualities and continues to be an inspiration to many practicing Hindus. Guhan is not a common name and is usually given to children from Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state in India. Another variation of the name that's common in Southern India is Guhesan (pronounced \\"Gu\\"-\\"hey\\"-\\"son\\"). In the Hindu mythology, it is believed that Skanda or Muruga is the son of Siva (aka Shiva, Easan) alone without mother Parvathi (the goddess) And so \\"Guha-Easan\\" means \\"The son of Easan\\". Which over time has become the current form Guhesan.  Literature  Kambar (poet) : Kambar (Kamban in casual address) (Tamil: ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ∞‡Øç) (c. 1180, Tiruvaluntur, Tanjore district, India ‚Äì 1250)[1] was a medieval Tamil poet and the author of the Ramavataram, popularly known as Kambaramayanam, the Tamil version of Ramayana.[2] Kambar also authored other literary works in Tamil, such as Erezhupathu, Silaiezhupathu, Kangai Puranam, sadagopar anthathi, and Sarasvati Anthati.[2] Kamba Ramayanam : The original version of Ramayana was written by Valmiki. It is an epic of 24,000 verses which depicts the journey of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya who belonged to Raghuvamsa (Solar dynasty). In Hinduism, Rama is the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, one of the Trimurti (the Hindu holy trinity which includes Brahma and Shiva). The Ramavataram or Kamba Ramayanam of Kamban is an epic of about 11,000 stanzas, as opposed to Valmiki's 24000 couplets.[4] The Rama-avataram or Rama-kathai as it was originally called was accepted into the holy precincts in the presence of Vaishnava Acharya Nathamuni.[5] Kamba Ramayana is not a verbal translation of the Sanskrit epic by Valmiki, but a retelling of the story of Lord Rama.[5] Legend has it that the entire episode was written in one night by Lord Ganesh. Ganesha is said to have written the poems that Kambar dictated to him during the night, as Kambar procrastinated the work till the day before the deadline set by the King. There is also a legend that Ottakuthar‚Äîan eminent Tamil poet and a contemporary of Kambar[6][7]‚Äîalso composed Ramayanam. Tradition has it that Ottakoothar was ahead of Kambar as the former had already finished five cantos, but when the king asked for an update, Kambar‚Äîa master of words‚Äîlied that he was already working on the Setu Bandhalam, upon which Ottakoothar feeling dejected threw away all his work. Feeling guilty, Kambar recovered the last two chapters of Ottakoothar's composition and added into his own.[8]  Vedi Arasan  Ruins: claims Vedi Arasan fort while other say as ancient temple or stupa. Vediyarasan, the king of Nedunthivu ruling all islands and mannar (gulf) sea. His period not clearly defined. Someone quoting 'silapathikaram' said his period before 200 B.C. Vediyarasan means \\"king of firecrackers\\" may be the name derived using firecrackers to destroy enemy ships. Because of Pearl business flourising in this region; he was in a position to guard very effectively .  Religion  Most of the members of this community in India are Hindus.  Current condition  The history of this people started with Guhan. At the time of colonization, Mukguhar ran warships to counter the arrival of settlers. Over time, this community has lost its leadership and installed in various regions within the country. some of them were integrated into other communities, losing their original identity (example : their basic religion Hindu or profession). Others have maintained their identity through the cultivation of the land they own, the collection of pearls then transported to India temples (madurai), or to others, via the commander from merchant ship. Actually, many of the Mukguhars do a variety of jobs, including engineering, education, clerical, etc., though major part of the community does cultivation related works. However, there are many entrepreneurs and educationists among them. This should be considered as a normal happening in any dynamic working community. they are socially and economically placed in good positions from ancient times as they were mainly agriculturists or high ranking government officials.

He is also known for his community work with at-risk youth. Career Mitchell was born November 23, 1943, in Tarrytown, New York, and raised in Buffalo. His father was a Baptist minister and community activist. Mitchell was introduced to the piano as a child by his mother but resisted all formal instruction. Instead he learned to play the piano by listening to the music and jazz recordings of the day. Mitchell attended Morehouse College in the early 1960s, where he majored in history and political science. Between classes he would sneak into the music department to play jazz. He joined an off-campus jazz group, performing before an audience for the first time in a local talent show. In search of a career in music, he moved to Los Angeles in 1970. He formed the Billy Mitchell Trio in the 1970s, which later became the Billy Mitchell Group. During the 1980s and 1990s he performed at clubs and festivals, including the Sedona Jazz Festival. During the 1980s, Mitchell wrote a monthly column for Gig magazine that advised musicians about work and career. His book The Gigging Musician (Hal Leonard Publishing) is based on his Gig magazine articles, as well as interviews with industry professionals. Mitchell appeared in the Bird (1988) directed by Clint Eastwood film, playing the part of Charlie Parker's pianist. He also appeared in Jazz, a docudrama about the lives and experiences of black musicians. In 2002, Mitchell founded The Scholarship Audition Performance Preparatory Academy (SAPPA) to increase participation of inner-city students in music and art scholarship competitions. SAPPA also sponsors music workshops that provide free music instruction in various programs throughout the Los Angeles area. Mitchell established the Watts-Willowbook Conservatory and Youth Symphony.

It was founded in 1977 by gallerists Morgan Thomas, Connie Lewallen, and Claire Copley, who transferred leadership to the artist and mediator Dorit Cypis in 1979. Since then, FAR has been overseen collaboratively by over 20 different groups of Board Members and 100 artist-Directors. Currently the longest-running extant arts collective in Los Angeles with no exhibition space, FAR partners with different private, public and educational institutions throughout Los Angeles to produce exhibitions, lectures, and performances with a focus on the relational structures between art, producers, and audience. History Foundation for Art Resources, 1977-2017 Claire Copley, Morgan Thomas and Connie Lewallen directed amongst the most innovative galleries in the Los Angeles area during the mid-seventies. Claire Copley Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard presented a range of American and international artists including Allen Ruppersberg, Michael Asher, Bas Jan Ader, and William Leavitt. ThomasLewallen Gallery in Santa Monica showed many of the artists associated with Cal Arts including Douglas Huebler, John Baldessari, Jack Goldstein, and Jonathan Borofsky. Since the galleries were commercially unsuccessful, Thomas, Lewallen, and Copley developed the nonprofit organization Foundation for Art Resources, FAR, 1977, enabling them to work more flexibly with the artists they believed in. Without a permanent location to support FAR would be able to respond to the needs of each particular project, be it film, book, lecture, performance, or exhibition. Their first projects included the production of John Baldessari's film, Six Colorful Inside Jobs, the book and performance Open America by James Lee Byars, taking place in Los Angeles and New York simultaneously. In 1979, the three founders moved on to other pursuits and the direction of FAR was transferred to the artist Dorit Cypis who invited Christina Ritchie to join as partner. In 1979 Cypis and Ritchie maintained the exhibition space that was handed to them giving it up a year later to innovate an exploration of partnership with venues across the city, to question what an artist practice has to do with civic space and the public. Between 1979-1982, they initiated collaborative partnerships amongst numerous private, public and educational institutions throughout Los Angeles, producing and presenting contemporary art as site-specific installation, publication, video, film, performance, dialogue, radio, and the lecture series Art Talk Art addressing theoretical and critical issues of contemporary art and culture. Art events and dialogues were produced in numerous public contexts including the International Design Center, Downtown Los Angeles Public Library, an abandoned residential site, neighborhood movie theaters, a shopping center, etc. Participating artists included Mike Kelly, David Askevold, Louise Lawler, Candace Lewis, Matt Mullican, Glen Branca, Michael Smith, Barbara Bloom, the Kuchar Brothers, Jenny Holzer, Edit DeAk, as well as writers/historians Howard Singerman, Christopher Knight, Ann Rorimer, Ingrid Sischy, and Benjamin Buchloh. This was but a beginning of what continued to be generated by new FAR artist members over the next four decades. Many stories yet to be told. In 1980 Cypis and Ritchie initiated two major changes in FAR‚Äôs internal governance: 1. traditional power dynamic of a Board of Directors over the working staff was changed by stipulating that members of the Board are the working members of FAR; 2. FAR would be handed over to a new working Board of young artists and cultural workers every three years. The goal was to structure the identity of FAR as unfixed, to challenge artist members to work collectively, and to always distribute power. Between 1976-2016 FAR has been in the hands of more than 20 different groups and over 100 cultural workers as working Board members. FAR is the longest existing art collective without an exhibition space in Los Angeles. There is growing cultural interest in collective structures for production and artists are increasingly working collectively and socially to meet public contexts. FAR members have been exploring this vision for 40 years. \\"FAR was managed by its initial founders for two years before Morgan Thomas handed its leadership over to Dorit Cypis in 1979, along with an exhibition space in Downtown LA. Cypis invited Christina Ritchie to run the organization with her, and together they developed the by-laws that would see FAR run by the artist volunteers who would participate as working members. They gave up the exhibition space in 1980, deciding to focus on itinerant projects that would explore relationships between the art works and the organization and venue partners throughout Los Angeles that hosted them.\\" Cohen, Sande. \\"Not History: Remarks on the Foundation for Art Resources, 1977-1998,\\" in References External links * Foundation for Art Resources - official site Category:Non-profit organizations based in Los Angeles Category:Artist cooperatives in the United States Category:Art galleries established in 1977 Category:Art galleries in Los Angeles ","title":"Foundation for Art Resources"},{"id":"43113686","text":"The State President's Medal for Shooting was instituted by the State President of the Republic of Bophuthatswana in 1990, for award to champion shots.South African Medal Website - Bophuthatswana Defence Force (Accessed 30 April 2015)Republic of Bophuthatswana Constitution Act, 1977 The Bophuthatswana Defence Force The Bophuthatswana Defence Force (BDF) was established upon that country's independence on 6 December 1977.

Maymead Farm is one of Johnson County's oldest farms. The land was settled in the 18th century by the Wagner family, who received a land grant from King George II in 1747. Its name is derived from \\"May's Meadow\\", and was the name of a rail stop established on the farm when Norfolk and Western laid a railroad line through the area c. 1900. At one time, livestock production was the main agricultural activity on the farm, but farming activity was later diversified to include crops such as corn and hay. As of 1989, Maymead produced corn, tobacco, and beef, and was one of the largest working farms in Tennessee. During the Great Depression the farm diversified into quarrying, initially because of a contract from the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service to supply crushed lime for use on farms in southwestern Virginia, upper East Tennessee, and northwestern North Carolina. The owners continued quarrying limestone after the government contract ended, and later expanded from the production of agricultural lime to add production of rock aggregates for used on building roads and highways. The Maymead corporation now operates several quarries in Tennessee and North Carolina and includes asphalt production operations. As of 2012, descendants of the original owners were still the primary owners of the farm. Maymead is recognized as a bicentennial farm and is said to be one of only a few U.S. farms that have been owned by the same family since colonial times. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012 as \\"an important example of the agricultural history of the region\\". The National Register listing includes about of land, 26 buildings, and a family cemetery that was established c. 1820. The two houses on the property (the Barton Roby Brown House, built in 1905, and Maywood, built in 1930) are examples of Colonial Revival architecture. References External links * Maymead, Inc.

He is the head coach for the Clemson Tigers baseball team. From 2009 until 2015, he was the head coach of the Charleston Cougars, his alma mater. Under Lee, the Cougars reached four NCAA Tournaments, including one NCAA Super Regional. Playing career Lee played four seasons of baseball (1996‚Äì1999) at College of Charleston. An outfielder, Lee was a career .333 hitter and had 22 home runs. He became the program's fifth major-league draftee when he was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals following his senior year and played two seasons of minor league baseball, advancing as high as Single-A. Coaching career Lee began his coaching career with a two-year stint (2001‚Äì2002) as an assistant at Spartanburg Methodist, a junior college located in his hometown of Spartanburg, South Carolina. During Lee's tenure, the program reached an NJCAA Division I World Series and set a single-season win record. Lee then spent six seasons (2003‚Äì2008) as an assistant at South Carolina. The Gamecocks qualified for the NCAA Tournament in each of Lee's six seasons and also appeared in two College World Series. =College of Charleston= Lee was hired as the head coach at College of Charleston prior to the start of the 2009 season. In Lee's second season, the Cougars broke the 40-win mark and appeared in their first NCAA Tournament in his tenure. At the Myrtle Beach Regional, the Cougars advanced to the regional final with wins over third- seeded NC State and first-seeded Coastal Carolina, but were eliminated with consecutive defeats by Coastal in the championship round. In 2012, the team shared the Southern Conference regular season title and advanced to another NCAA Tournament, where it went 1‚Äì2. In 2014, Charleston won the conference tournament in their first season in the Colonial Athletic Association. The Cougars then won the Gainesville Regional with a 3‚Äì0 record, defeating host Florida and Long Beach State twice. In the Lubbock Super Regional, the Cougars were defeated by Texas Tech in consecutive 1‚Äì0 games. In 2015 season, the Cougars won the CAA regular season crown with a 21‚Äì3 record, before falling to the UNCW Seahawks in the CAA Championship game. Charleston was selected as a #2 seed in Florida State's Tallahassee Regional, where they went 2‚Äì2, finishing second behind the host Seminoles. In Lee's seven seasons at Charleston, 21 players were selected in the Major League Baseball Draft. Pitcher Heath Hembree was taken in the 5th round by the San Francisco Giants in 2010 and reached the major leagues in 2013. A total of six Cougars were taken in that draft, the highest total of Lee's tenure. In his final season at Charleston, the Arizona Diamondbacks selected pitcher Taylor Clarke in the third round, making him the program's highest ever selection. =Clemson= On June 18, 2015, Clemson hired Lee to be their 28th head coach in program history; Lee became only the third head coach at Clemson since 1958 (taking over a program that ranked 8th all-time in Division I wins at the time of his hire). Monte Lee guided the 2016 Tigers to an ACC Baseball Tournament title in his first season, defeating the defending ACC Champion Florida State Seminoles in a marathon game by a score of 18‚Äì13 at the Durham Bulls Athletic Park in Durham, NC. The win produced the program's first conference title in ten years and Lee's first Clemson team captured the program's 10th conference tournament title and 15th overall ACC championship - both league records. Lee also became the third consecutive Clemson head coach to win the ACC in his first season, joining Bill Wilhelm (1958) and Jack Leggett (1994). The Tigers' 44 victories in 2016 are the second-most victories by a first-year head coach in Clemson history.

After the second world war Gerard Reve, and later Gerrit Komrij and Tom Lanoye became the leading names. Most of these LGBT writers are Dutch-language writers contributing to Dutch-language literature, some of them acquiring a place in the Canon of Dutch Literature.  Before late 19th century  Johannes Kneppelhout circa 1865 Before the last decades of the 19th century words like uranism, homosexual, sapphism, lesbian and transvestite didn't exist. Being called a true Sappho of Lesbos was a high compliment for female poets, without sexual connotations.Meijer 1998, Introduction pp. 1-23 Words like sodomy, pederast and hermaphrodite existed and had their Dutch-language counterpart, but only very partially covered what would become LGBT (Dutch equivalent: holebi) in a more modern understanding.Hekma 2004, p. 3 Generally the older terms, most of all sodomy, had a negative connotation. Writing about these topics was usually either pornographic or in terms of condemnable (religious) sin. From the 19th century these subjects were also more often treated in medical science, which led to the more modern terminology. Authors writing in a positive manner about bonds between people of the same sex spoke about friendship (in Dutch: vriendschap). Such friendships could be qualified as romantic friendships. Whether there was a component of sexuality was unclear and if so, not outspoken. Friendship was certainly not always a euphemism for something more, nor even for Platonic love. Guido Gezelle's poem Dien avond en die rooze A friendship was recorded between the writers Betje Wolff and Aagje Deken: they also wrote about the topic of true friendship. Johannes Kneppelhout, choosing Klikspaan (= snitch) as pen name for some of his writings, was a 19th-century example of writing about friendship in this sense, for example in his 1875 Een beroemde knaap (A Famous Boy). Also Guido Gezelle does not really qualify as a LGBT writer in Komrij's definition: as a Catholic priest he certainly did not write explicitly for a gay audience, nor was any of his writing strictly speaking about homosexuality. Nonetheless Dien avond en die rooze (That Evening and that Rose) is generally understood to have been a love-poem for Eug√®ne van Oye, one of his students he had befriended. Louis Couperus 1897 Fin de si√®cle Late-19th-century Dutch writers who tried to get LGBT literature across the border of pornography include Louis Couperus.\\"Literatuur en porno\\" at Georges Eekhoud published Escal-Vigor in 1899. In the early 20th century Jacob Isra√´l de Haan started publishing his LGBT-themed works. =Tachtigers= A young Georges Eekhoud For Couperus' generation of Dutch- language authors, known as the Tachtigers, writing openly about homosexuals in novels was impossible, while writing about antiquity left more leeway.Schoonhoven 2003Hekma 1990 p. 66 In 1891 Couperus published his novel Noodlot with an 'effeminate' protagonist, while his more explicit novel De berg van licht (1904‚Äì05) employed the technique of placing the action in ancient Rome. It was generally known that Couperus was homosexual. Arnold Aletrino was a LGBT Tachtiger writing both fiction and non-fiction. Other Tachtigers with same-sex tendencies, like Willem Kloos, writing passionate poems about men, and Lodewijk van Deyssel, describing a special friendship with one of his fellow students in his 1889 De kleine republiek, repressed their feelings.Hekma 2004, p. 28 Albert Verwey's cycle of 44 sonnets, Van de liefde die vriendschap heet (On Love that is Named Friendship), written in response to Kloos' passion for him, was perceived as coded homoeroticism, although mostly about spiritual love in intent. =Georges Eekhoud= Georges Eekhoud was a Flemish author writing in French. In 1899 his LGBT themed novel Escal-Vigor was published. It led to a trial in 1900, which Eekhoud won.Rob Delvigne and Leo Ross. Introduction to De Haan's Nerveuze Vertellingen (1983) p. 8-50De Haan moved to (then Arab) Jeruzalem in 1919 =H√©l√®ne van Zuylen= After marriage H√©l√®ne van Zuylen, by birth a French Rothschild, came to live in a castle near Utrecht. Together with her English lover Ren√©e Vivien she published poems and novels in French, among others in 1904 L'√ätre double, a novel on Androgyny (under the pseudonym Paule Riversdale). =Jacob Isra√´l de Haan= Jacob Isra√´l de Haan describes living in the Netherlands as a nightmare that continues after waking up, and looked for Eekhoud as an ally to escape from this narrowminded societyDe Haan 1983 p. 52 when dedicating his \\"rape of Jesus\\" short story to him. The two authors kept in contact by letter.Rob Delvigne and Leo Ross. \\"Ik ben toch zo innig blij dat u mijn vriend bent\\" in De Revisor Nr. 3 (1982) pp. 61-71 For his style, De Haan was indebted to Couperus. De Haan's style oscillates between the l'art pour l'art style of the Tachtigers and a more engaged, less embellished style. His Tachtigers friends had given him however little support when getting in trouble after the publication of his first explicit gay novel Pijpelijntjes in 1904. In the first edition of the book de Haan's friend Arnold Aletrino had been portrayed too recognisable. =Light reading= Under a cloak of moralizing against fornication some authors went in great detail describing libidinous topics. Also for homosexuality this genre was practiced, for instance Feenstra Kuiper's 1905 illustrated pornographic novel Jeugdige zondaars te Constantinopel (Youthful Sinners in Constantinople), reading as a gay tour guide to the city. Easy-reading novels, usually with a melodramitic plot, were provided by M. J. J. Exler (Levensleed, 1911), Marie Metz-Koning, and Maurits Wagenvoort (Het koffiehuis met de roode buisjes, 1916).Hekma 2004, p. 51 A play about Oscar Wilde was written by Adolphe Engers in 1917. =Non- fiction= In 1883 N. B. Donkersloot, editor of a medical journal, was the first to publish a testimony originally written in Dutch of a man preferring same-sex.Hekma 2004, p. 32-33 Around this time most Dutch-language medical literature on the subject was however borrowed from foreign examples, mostly from Germany and France.Hekma 2004, p. 31-35 From 1897 to 1908 Arnold Aletrino published his non-fiction works about uranism, in which he described chaste friendship as a superior form of uranism.Hekma 2004, p. 36-37 Lucien von R√∂mer, who had written love poetry for a man when he was young, published in Hirschfeld's journal in the early 20th century. He was also the first to conduct an inquiry on sexual behavior, and defended the sexual act for homosexuals. His major work was Het uranisch gezin (The Uranian Family, 1905).Hekma 2004, p. 37-39 In 1911 a new article in Dutch law (248bis) discriminated against homosexuality. Jacob Schorer, a lawyer, started publishing against this law.Schorer 1911 Aletrino and R√∂mer supported, but no longer published on the subject. Also before the first World War Hubertus J. Schouten had published on similar topics, under various pen-names.Hekma 2004, p. 43-44 Interbellum Maria Nys second from left among members of the Bloomsbury Group Lesbian Maria Nys, later Mrs. Aldous Huxley, left Belgium before moving into literary circles like the Bloomsbury Group. Her contributions to literature are limited; the best known is her tampering with the text of Lady Chatterley's Lover, which led its author, D. H. Lawrence, to be discontented with the first print of that work.Stan Lauryssens. Mijn heerlijke nieuwe wereld (2001) During his Berlin period (1918‚Äî21) Belgian avant-garde poet Paul van Ostaijen wrote homoerotic letters, and would have experimented with gay sex.Pleij 1996 Willem Arondeus In 1919 poet Pieter Cornelis Boutens was hiding behind a fictional name when he published his homoerotic Strophen uit de nalatenschap van Andries de Hoghe. In 1930 he was refused a knighthood for rumours of his homosexuality.Snijders 2003 Other poets in the Netherlands included Willem de M√©rode, pen name for W. E. Keuning (Ganymedes, illustrated by Johan Dijkstra, 1924) and Willem Arondeus (his homoerotic poems Afzijdige Strofen were however only published many years after his death).Hekma 2004, p. 52-53 New melodramatic novels, similar in plot to those that were published before the end of the war, were published by J. H. Fran√ßois, writing under the pen name Charlie van Heezen (Anders, 1918 and Het masker, 1922), Johan de Meester (Walmende lampen, 1920), Bernard Brondgeest (Doolhof, 1921), Wilma (God's gevangene, 1923), and Adolphe Engers together with Ernst Winar (Peccavi...??? Roman uit het Haagsche leven, 1920). A gay play Wat niet mag... was written by J. M. IJssel de Schepper-Beckers in 1922.Hekma 2004, p. 53 Avant-garde artist Til Brugman, fluent in several languages, publishes poems from 1923. She also writes literary grotesques, amongst others on sexual minorities, which she belonged to, living together with LGBT lovers like Hannah H√∂ch. Carry van Bruggen, sister of Jacob Isra√´l de Haan, published her partly autobiographical novel Eva in 1927. David, the homosexual brother of Eva in the novel, is to a certain extent modelled after the author's brother Jacob Isra√´l. Van Bruggen portrays the main character of her novel as bisexual. Edith Werkendam lived in the Netherlands and Belgium. Several of her novels are about LGBT topics, among which De goddelijke zonde about bisexuality, published in 1928.Ten Duis 2013 Josine Reuling's 1937 novel Terug naar het eiland can be read as a commentary on Radclyffe Hall's 1928 The Well of Loneliness.Ten Duis 2013, pp. 31-32 Front page of the first number of Levensrecht, March 1940 Jef Last published two gay novels: Zuiderzee (1934) and Het huis zonder vensters (1935). In 1936 Last and Andr√© Gide travelled across the Soviet Union. Both published about this trip, with some attention to LGBT topics, Gide in 1936 and Last in 1966 (Mijn vriend Andr√© Gide).Hekma 2004, p. 55-56 Together with Harry Wilde Last published a novel (Kruisgang der jeugd, 1939) about Marinus van der Lubbe, against a trend that equalled homosexuality with nazism.Hekma 2004, p. 56 After the war there were Last's De jeugd van Judas (1962) and the pornographic De zeven caramboles (posthumous, 1973). Decadent poets were attacked by Seerp Anema in his 1926 Moderne Kunst en Ontaarding. Jacob Anton Schorer continued to publicize in defense of homosexuality in the period between the wars. A. J. Luikinga published under the pen name Commutator, among others his 1927 defense Homosexualiteit.Hekma 2004, p. 55 In 1929 Ernest Michel published an anti-gay writing Anti-homo: Een geschrift tegen de weekdieren onzer samenleving.Hekma 2004, p. 58 Koos Vorrink warned against homosexuality in his 1933 Om de vrije mens der nieuwe gemeenschap: Opvoeding tot het demokratiese socialisme. 1934 publications by J. H. van der Hoop (Homosexualiteit) and Benno J. Stokvis (Homosexualiteit en strafrecht) were equally heteronormative.Hekma 2004 p. 56 Stokvis' 1939 De homosexueelen: 35 biographie√´n gave insight in daily life of LGBT people. Medical publications concentrated on possible cures for homosexuality, like castration (e.g. G. Sanders Het castratievraagstuk, 1935).Hekma 2004, p. 48 L. Bender's 1937 Verderfelijke propaganda summarized the Catholic rejection of homosexuality.Hekma 2004, p. 59 A few months before the second world war came to the Netherlands Jaap van Leeuwen (pen name: Arent van Santhorst), Nico Engelschman (pen name: Bob Angelo) and Hann Diekmann became the authors and editors of a new periodical Levensrecht defending LGBT rights. After the second world war Gerard Reve in 1969 In 1966 Gerard Reve's Nader tot U was published, containing a description of the author having sex with God in the guise of a young donkey ‚Äî the press was alarmed.Meester 2012 It took to the early 1980s, with a series of short stories by De Haan republished, that the press started to realize that Reve had been less ground-breaking on LGBT themes in the Dutch-language area than assumed.Van Eeden 1984 Reve remained the most influential of Dutch-language LGBT writers after the second world war. In the 21st century LGBT writers became less concerned with their LGBT status, being a good author is their primary concern. Dutch-language literary events, like poetry nights (\\"De Nacht van de Po√´zie\\" organized since 1966), and prizes (like AKO Literatuurprijs, Royal Academy of Dutch Language and Literature Prize) often have an international dimension, bringing together writers from the Low Countries. Non-fiction writings showed a major change towards acceptation of homosexuality in the early 1960s. For instance, the first edition of Tolsma's Homosexualiteit en homo√´rotiek (1948) warned against homosexuality, and rejected it. The second edition of that book (1963) had replaced that language by words of tolerance.Hekma 2004, p. 68 =Gerard Reve and the post-war generation= Andreas Burnier in 1986 Gerard Reve's novel De Avonden was published in 1947 and gave a new start for LGBT writing in Dutch, both in the Netherlands and in Flanders (where Reve spent the last years of his life). The significance of Reve and his first novel were tremendous. Within a year after publication De Avonden had received 50 book reports in the press,Lamon 2011 p. 6 and by the end of the 1960s it was considered a timeless classic of Dutch literature.Lamon 2011 p. 7 The book has often been compared with Salinger's Catcher in the Rye.Joost Zwagerman. \\"Anker Amerika\\" in De Volkskrant 25 October 2013 pp. 3-4 In the early 21st century Dick Matena made a graphic novel version of De Avonden. For several generations Dutch-language LGBT writers would pay their tribute to Reve. Further novels by Reve with a homosexual theme include Melancholia (1951), In God we Trust (two chapters published in 1957), Op weg naar het einde (1963), Nader tot U (1966), and Prison Song in Prose (1967). Hans Warren published his first poems in 1946. Second wave of creativity from the late 1960s. From 1978 he started a relation with the much younger Mario Molegraaf, with whom he co-authored. The 23 volumes of Warrens diary were published from 1981 to 2009. Jac. van Hattum wrote poetry and short stories (e.g. Mannen en katten, 1947; Un an deplus, un an de moins, 1955; De liefste gast, 1961; De wolfsklauw, 1962; De ketchupcancer, 1965), receiving recognition by Reve.Hekma 2004, p. 69 Hans Lodeizen received most recognition after his early death in 1950. His poetry was cryptic on homosexuality. Poet Jan Hanlo fell in love with a Moroccan boy: his reminiscence of this love was published in 1971 as Go to the mosk: Brieven uit Marokko.Hekma 2004, p. 70 Homosexual writers and poets of this first post war generation include Jaap Harten, Bernard Sijtsma, Adriaan Venema, Jos , Ast√®re-Michel Dhondt and Frits Bernard (a.k.a. Victor Servatius).Hekma 2004, p. 71 Annie M. G. Schmidt included gay characters in her texts for the performing arts. Among the Dutch female writers addressing homosexuality in the post-war generation was Anna Blaman: the erotic passages of her 1948 novel Eenzaam avontuur (Lonely Adventure) stirred contemporary authors to a fake process so-called regarding her literary style.Ten Duis 2013, p. 34 There was also Dola de Jong, whose book The Tree and the Vine was first published in 1951 (after she had moved to America fleeing the Nazis); it is about a lesbian couple during World War II and is likely her best-known work apart from her mystery novels. It was republished in 1996 by The Feminist Press. Gerrit Komrij in 1994 In Belgium there was another author from Flanders writing in French: with her 1951 novel Le Rempart des B√©guines Fran√ßoise Mallet-Joris creates a succ√®s de scandale over its lesbian content.Ronny De Schepper 2012 In 1963 Carla Walschap was the first Dutch-language Flemish author with a novel on a lesbian theme (De eskimo en de roos). Andreas Burnier (pseudonym for Catharina Irma Dessaur): first novel Een tevreden lach (1965) describes how she discovered being a lesbian. She is known to be the first who took lesbianism for granted in the Netherlands, just as Reve had for male homosexuality. = Next generation of Dutch-language LGBT writers = * Gerrit Komrij: poet, novelist, playwright, critic, polemist and translator. Verwoest Arcadi√´ (Destroyed Arcadia, 1980) is an autobiographical novel about discovering boys and books when he was young.

Writers for LGBT stage productions included Komrij, Gerardjan Rijnders, Cleo van Agt, Han van Delden (pseudonym: Hans van Weel), Cas Enklaar and Joop Admiraal.Hekma 2004, p.98 =Periodicals - comic strips= In the Netherlands Levensrecht continued after its war-time suspension with Van Leeuwen, Engelschman and now Jo van Dijk. The periodical was later renamed to Vriendschap (Friendship) published by COC Nederland. Gerard Reve contributed to another COC periodical Dialoog from 1965 to 1967, provoking a lawsuit over his description of intercourse with God in the guise of a donkey (which he eventually won).Hekma 2004, p.70Fekkes 1968 In Flanders groups bringing together Flemish LGBT people existed from the early 1960s, the first of which was COC Vlaanderen, closely connected to COC Nederland.Hellinck 2002, p. 7 Some of these groups had their local bulletins, but they remained exclusively dependent on COC Nederland for the broader publications until 1972.Hellinck 2002, p. 14 LGBT periodicals published in the Netherlands targeting an international Dutch-language readership include Expreszo (published from 1988)Geurds and De Heide 2013, p. 22 and Madam (for gay women, publication stopped 1999).Geurds and De Heide 2013, p. 17 From 2013 the Flemish ZiZo- magazine and Gay&Night; from the Netherlands collaborated for the publication of Gay&Night-ZiZo; targeting a younger audience than ZiZo-magazine.

In his 1996 short novel Gebr. he writes about his coming out and his younger brother who also was homosexual.

In the finishing straight he pulled steadily away to win by two and a half lengths from Judiths Wild Rush, who was a further one and a half lengths clear of third-placed Mass Media.http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE;=EQB&DAY;=D&tid;=SAR&dt;=08/12/2006&ctry;=USA‚àΩÃ±=7 Three weeks later, War Front raced at Grade I level for the first time when he contested the Forego Handicap. He bumped with Silver Wagon at the start and then raced up with the pace. He challenged in the finishing stretch, but could not get past winner Pomeroy and faded in the final stages to finish in second place, two and a quarter lengths behind Pomeroy, and a neck ahead of third- placed Friendly Island.http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE;=EQB&DAY;=D&tid;=SAR&dt;=09/02/2006&ctry;=USA‚àΩÃ±=8 Later in the year, War Front finished second in the Vosburgh Stakes. In his final race he finished seventh behind winner Thor's Echo in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. Stud career 250px War Front was retired to stud at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky. Expectations were initially moderate, and his stud fee dipped to a low of $10,000 in 2011. That same year though, his first crop turned age three and several of them became stakes winners, both in America on dirt and then in Europe on turf. \\"He started out with more of a reputation as a dirt sire\\", said Walker Hancock, president of Claiborne. \\"It wasn't until he had two winners at Royal Ascot (Declaration of War and War Command) on the same day that he got dubbed a turf sire.\\" Thanks in part to the support of Coolmore Stud, he started attracting better quality mares and his stud fee steadily increased. His stud fee for 2018 and 2019 was $250,000 (increased from $200,000 for 2016 and $150,000 for 2015 and 2014). This was tied for the highest fees in North America for 2019 and is among the highest in the world. His most notable progeny so far are: * Data Link ‚Äì a bay horse foaled in 2008 who won the Maker's Mark Mile Stakes, and now also stands as a stallion at Claiborne Farm. * Summer Soiree ‚Äì a bay mare foaled in 2008 who won the Del Mar Oaks. *The Factor ‚Äì a gray horse foaled in 2008 who won the Grade 1 Pat O'Brien Handicap and Malibu Stakes as a three-year-old.

Retrieved from ftp://202.60.207.28/BP/2008/03_BP_Mar/01032008/BK010308012.pdf These researches have been aimed toward analyzing the culture from the three periods humans lived in the Tham Lod rockshelter (Late Pleistocene, Early Holocene, and Late Holocene). An excavation at the Tham Lod rockshelter from 2001 to 2002 provided important knowledge of the past environment based from the analysis from collected pollen data. Pollen that is collected can be analyzed for an insight on the climate of the past, as it can survive for over 100,000 years under specific conditions. The pollen analysis suggested that humans have impacted the environment, especially the vegetation in Tham Lod, for instance using ferns for medicinal reasons. Deforestation in the area in the past may also be caused by humans. =Human Occupation= A study in Northwest Thailand, in particular Tham Lod funded by the Australian National University‚Äôs Graduate School and Center for Archaeological Research and the Australian Institute for Nuclear Science and Engineering, conducted by Ben Marwick dates human occupation in Tham Lod from 40,000 BP to 10,000 BP.7\\\\.

Additionally migrants from China may have contributed to the population increase.Marwick, B. and M. K. Gagan 2011.

Ben Marwick's study of Tham Lod found that there were a considerable amount of stone artifacts which supports that humans occupied the area at an estimated minimum number of 1722 artifacts.Marwick, B. (2008). Stone artefacts and human ecology at two rockshelters in Northwest Thailand. PhD Thesis. Canberra, The Australian National University. In fact, for the most of Tham Lod there were indications that the area was primarily an ancient tool workshop. The materials that may have been utilized to make the tools found were sandstone, quartzite, mudstone, andesite, siltstone, and slate; these tools included chopper- chopping tools, scrapers, sumatraliths (a typical artefact of the Hoabinhian), short-axes, disks, and utilized flakes. Despite the different amount of tools that were made, there were other variations in stone artifacts from different layers may have a correlation to trade activity among the humans that once lived in Tham Lod. =Burials= The Tham Lod rockshelter was discovered to contain multiple bodies that were buried in the past by humans. This discovery was made by a research carried out by Rasmi Shoocongdej of the Highland Archaeology Project funded by the US Ambassador Fund for Cultural Preservation in 2006. There were two of which had significant traces of possible human culture at the time. These bodies were buried in levels above one another (the undetermined skeleton was above the female skeleton). The first skeleton, with an undetermined gender was found in an extended burial underground and the age was 12,100 +/- 60 years BP. The second skeleton, a female was found in a flexible burial; the approximated height of the skeleton was about and dated to 13,640 +/- 80 years BP. The undetermined skeleton was found to be buried with shellfish and land snails, while the female skeleton had plants, flakes and a hammer stone. Paleoenvironment A study in 2006 conducted by Suwongpong Wattanapituksakul of Chulongcorn University at Tham Lod in the Mae Hong Son Province described the environment from 35,000 to 10,000 BP to stay the same as the same animals that thrived in that area existed until 10,000 BP.Wattanapituksakul, Suwangpong 2006. Late pleistocene mammal teeth from the Tham Lod rockshelter, Amphoe Pang Mapha, Changwat Mae Hong Son. MSc Thesis, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok. Retrieved from http://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/13643 Suwongpong analyzed data from mammal teeth found in Tham Lod to find 2003 number of identified specimens, which were then classified into 31 taxa. These animals included: Rhinocerotidae, Rhizomyidae, Rhizomys spp., Cannomys badius, Bandicota spp., and Bandicota indica. Animals such as the Rhinocerotidae required a specialized habitat, indicating that the environment was a dense forest for until 10,000 BP. The climate of the Tham Lod Rockshelter from the Œ¥18O data collected by Ben Marwick and MIchael K. Gagan, funded by a University Postgraduate Award, the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering and the ANU Department of Archaeology and Natural History, for the ANU Department of Archaeology and Natural History in the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, showed that from 35,000 to 20,000BP the climate was wet and varied, then from 20,000 to 11,500 BP, it was dry; after 11,500 BP, the climate did not show any variation and became more wet. Furthermore, the forest around the Tham Lod rockshelter from the late Pleistocene period is still the same today.

Rutledge took sheep overland to Port Phillip District in 1838. He purchased several lots at the early Melbourne land sales and commenced a partnership with Benjamin Baxter, financing him to build cottages in the Port Phillip area at ¬£650 each. At Kilmore Rutledge established a tenant community on a special survey, and although he never took it up he became known as the town's founder and gave land for a Roman Catholic church. In fact all of Charles Bonney, later a famous explorer of South Australia, Dr Richard Julian Hamlyn and the partners Frederick Armand Powlett and John Green preceded Rutledge at Kilmore.

Life and work  He was born in Morges. He was the son of a teacher and began his art studies in Geneva, then worked for two years as a jewelry enamel painter. In 1849, he obtained a position in the studios of history painter Jean-L√©onard Lugardon (1801‚Äì1884). While there, he also took courses in anatomical drawing at a nearby art school. The following year, he began attending the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf and became a member of \\"Malkasten\\" (Paintbox), a local artists' association. He left the Academy for one year to work with Rudolf Jordan as a private student. Eventually, he decided to devote himself to depicting peasant life, which he observed for several years by visiting the Bernese Oberland. In 1856 he went to Paris, but returned to D√ºsseldorf a year later and painted his first peasant genre pictures. Initially, he focused on Switzerland, but finally decided to concentrate on the Black Forest region. He also worked as an illustrator (Der Oberhof by Karl Leberecht Immermann, Barf√º√üele by Berthold Auerbach, and others). Later, he became a Royal Professor at the Academy in D√ºsseldorf.

A dental torque wrench or restorative torque wrench is a torque wrench used to precisely apply a specific torque to a fastener bolt for fixation of an abutment, dentures or prosthetics on a dental implant. Manual mechanical torque wrench Toggle torque wrenches (friction-style) and beam wrenches (spring-style) are the most common types in dentistry as manual mechanical torque-limiting devices. Beam type wrenches in general are more consistent to its calibration than toggle types. The beam types with a dial indicator are the most precise to set the Tare torque (zero point reset). Because steam sterilization processes like an autoclave are applied to the dental torque wrenches and the length of time in use presents stress on the material, fatigue can occur. Surgical motor The surgical motor is an electronic controlled torque-limiting device that also controls the speed. It is used with a twisted drill to make space in the bone for the implant or to fasten the screw (torque control can be with a torque-limiting attachment) with a screwdriver bit. In high precision areas such as aerospace applications motor or pneumatic torque wrenches are set at a lower torque value after which the final torque is set with a manual mechanical torque wrench, they are calibrated before every use, if a wrench breaks or loses calibration every fastener done with that wrench is redone. Calibration Various studies point to deviations of 10% and higher than the desired torque, regular recalibration with a torque tester restores the required torque values. Re- torquing As the settling effect (the flattening of the material's micro- surface under pressure) causes a lesser torque of around 10% in a relative short time, re-torquing the fastener after 10 minutes reduces this effect as the parts get more seated. Wet and dry torque Wet torques (bolts lubricated with saliva) have a higher mean torque than dry torques (unlubricated).

Early life Jernstedt was born in Yamhill County, Oregon, to Fred and Mae Jernstedt, and grew up on a farm in Carlton. He graduated from Yamhill High School in 1935 and from Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon, in January 1939. Flying career After graduation, he enlisted in the United States Marine Air Corps. He earned his pilot wings in 1941 at Pensacola, Florida, and was assigned to Quantico. In 1941, Jernstedt was recruited to join the Flying Tigers to fight the Japanese in China, resigning his Marine Corps commission (with the secret approval of the US government). \\"Tribute to Kenneth Jernstedt / Hon. Greg Walden of Oregon in the House of Representatives / Thursday, September 6, 2001\\" He became a flight leader of the 3rd Squadron, flying the Curtiss P-40. On one mission, he and fellow flight leader William Reed strafed two airfields and were credited with destroying 15 enemy aircraft on the ground; they split the bonus of $7,500 ($500 per aircraft). In his Flying Tigers career, Jernstedt was credited with an additional three victories, for a total of 10.5. In a 1999 interview, he stated that the figure should have been 12.5, but two could not be confirmed. Because he was ill, he received permission to leave the Flying Tigers several weeks before the unit was disbanded in early July 1942 (after the United States had entered the war). Returning to the United States, he joined Republic Aviation as a civilian test pilot. Among the aircraft he flew was the P-47 Thunderbolt. Post-war life and death After the war ended, he moved to Hood River, Oregon, in 1946. He bought the Hood River Bottling Works, a soft drink bottler that he ran for 25 years. He also entered politics, serving first as mayor of Hood River from 1959 to 1960. He was then elected to the Oregon State Legislature for one term in 1966 and the first of five terms in the Oregon State Senate in 1968. Following his last term as senator, he was again elected mayor of Hood River, from 1989 to 1990. He married college sweetheart Laura Elliott in 1942; they had a son and three daughters. After her death in 1960, he married Genevieve Weder Carl in 1962, adopting her son and two daughters. Gen was a politician as well, and supported her husband's work, serving as his legislative aide. Ken Jernstedt died on February 5, 2013, at the age of 95. Honors The main entrance gate to the Portland Air National Guard Base was named the Jernstedt Gate in 1981. In 1996, Jernstedt and the other surviving Flying Tigers pilots were belatedly awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Hood River's public airfield was renamed Ken Jernstedt Airfield on September 6, 2001. Jernstedt was one of the nine inaugural inductees in the Oregon Aviation Hall of Fame in 2003; he was also inducted into the Oregon Aviation Hall of Honor in the same year. In 2010, Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs public affairs officer Mike Allegre, who grew up with Jernstedt's children, wrote of him in the state-published book 150 Years of Oregon Veterans.

It is operated by Companhia Cearense de Transportes Metropolitanos, which also operates the Fortaleza Metro. It is expected to transport about 5,000 passengers per day. The line went into operation on an experimental basis on 1 December 2009, and went into regular service in 2010. This rail line connects the cities of Crato and Juazeiro do Norte together, and is operated with diesel light rail vehicles (LRVs). The initially estimated cost for implementation of this project was R$ 13,223,522; the cost that was later revised to R$ 25,190,720. The commuter rail system was implemented on a existing railway line, where the rail was adjusted to allow for the acquisition of greater speeds between stations. Five stations were built in Juazeiro do Norte, and four in Crato. In the future, it is planned to extend this rail line to the city of Barbalha, south of Juazeiro do Norte.  History  In late 2006 L√∫cio Alc√¢ntara, the then-Governor of Cear√° announced the construction of a passenger rail line in Cariri, which was later renamed Metr√¥ do Cariri. The inauguration was scheduled for February 2007, but in January 2007 work on the line was halted due to the change in state government, and was only resumed in June 2007. The Metro Cariri was officially opened for test service on 1 December 2009, and after further testing was opened for full commercial operation in 2010.  Operations  = Line = The Cariri Metro's single passenger rail line, called the Central Line, serves a total of nine stations, and runs over a total length of , consisting entirely of an at-grade rail route. The gauge of this line is meter gauge (). The frequency of trains on the line is every 40 minutes on weekdays, and every one hour and 20 minutes on Saturdays. A second line for the system, to be called the South Line, is in the planning stages. = Rolling stock = The fleet generally consists of a LRV trainset composition which is formed by two air-conditioned cars, and which are capable of carrying up to 330 passengers per train. While the vehicles used by the Cariri Metro have a maximum speed of , they operate with a maximum speed of on the rail line itself. The LRVs operated on this line are diesel hydraulic powered.

Through historical accounts, Winston demonstrates how technology reinforces social trends, and how social conditions lead to specific inventions.\\"FCJ-084 Who‚Äôs Afraid of Technological Determinism?

Early life and naval career Born at St Illario just outside Genoa on Remembrance Day 1921, Moore was the son of an import-export merchant. The family then moved to New Zealand before Moore was sent to Sherborne, an independent boys' boarding school in Dorset, to complete his education. He joined the Royal Navy in 1939 and after specialising in hydrographic surveying was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1942. He joined the submarine service in 1944, later commanding the submarines HMS Totem and HMS Alaric prior to being appointed Commander of the Seventh Submarine Division, based at HMS Medway (former Landing Craft Tank LCT1109) in Singapore, in 1965. Following service in the Far East, Moore was promoted to captain and served as chief of staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Naval Home Command (CINCNAVHOME) and later in the Defence Intelligence Staff (Navy) at the Ministry of Defence in charge of Soviet Naval Intelligence. =Development of 'Goldfish' and the Trongle= During the World War II, Moore became acquainted with the difficulties experienced in getting men from submarines to land and later in his career he devoted much attention to this subject. While in command of the Seventh Submarine Division in Singapore in the mid-60s during the period of confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia he carried out experiments with the Special Boat Service (SBS) of the Royal Marines Commandos, working closely with a young 2nd lieutenant in that unit called Paddy Ashdown, later to become a British MP and latterly Lord Ashdown. These experiments built on earlier developments that had led to the development of 'Goldfish', which allowed submariners to enter and leave their vessels while submerged. Moore designed a device which he named 'Trongle' that allowed submariners to locate their vessel in the hours of darkness, revolutionising the way the SBS operated.  Editor of Jane's Fighting Ships  On retirement from the Royal Navy in 1973 Moore became editor of the authoritative Jane's Fighting Ships, which he did for the fifteen years until 1988, expanding the number of countries whose navies were described in detail from 108 to 152. During this period the first personal computers became available, but Moore did not use one, preferring a manual filing system in a shed in the garden at his home in Rickney, Sussex and communicating with contacts worldwide by letters written in longhand, =Other publications= Besides editing 15 editions of Jane's Fighting Ships and other works published by Jane's, Moore published several books including: The Soviet Navy Today (1976); Warships of the Royal Navy (1979); Seapower and Politics from the Norman Conquest to the Present Day (1979); Warships of the Soviet Navy (1981); The Encyclopedia of the World's Warships(1985); (with Richard Compton-Hall) Submarine Warfare: Today and Tomorrow (1986); and The Impact of Polaris (1999). Honorary appointments Moore was appointed Visiting Professor of International Relations at the University of Aberdeen from 1987‚Äì89 and at the University of St Andrews from 1990‚Äì92.

His older brother, Marshall, was among the first African-American students to attend a desegregated Fulton High School, where he was a standout in football, and was awarded a scholarship to Florida A&M.; Jackie followed in his brother's footsteps, joining the Fulton squad in 1965. His head coach, Lon Herzbrun, had played for Tennessee in the mid-1950s, and had built Fulton into a regional powerhouse. During his senior year in 1967, Walker averaged over 20 tackles per game, and was named All-State, helping lead Fulton to an undefeated season.

Tennessee posted a record of 30‚Äì5 during Walker's three-year stint as a starting linebacker. NFL and later life Walker was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the sixth round of the 1972 NFL Draft. At just 6'0\\", 200 pounds, he was considered too small to play linebacker in the NFL, and the 49ers had hoped to convert him to a strong safety. After struggling with the position change, he was cut just prior to the start of the season. Herzbrun, his former coach, suggested the 49ers weren't patient enough in waiting for Walker to transition to the new position. However, Walker later confided to his friend, artist Daw'U Smith, that he was cut because the 49ers organization found out he was gay. He afterward tried out for the Washington Redskins, but was unable to make the team. While Walker never publicly \\"came out\\" as gay, he made little attempt to hide the fact after his senior season at Tennessee. By the end of the year, his family, teammates and coaches were aware of his sexual orientation. Herzbrun remembered that while driving to Walker's draft party in East Knoxville, a nervous Coach Battle stated he was going leave if Walker showed up in a dress. Abandoning his attempts at an NFL career in 1974, Walker moved to Atlanta, where he worked for the city's parks and recreation department. After contracting HIV in 1998, he spent his final years traveling around the world. He died of complications from AIDS on December 5, 2002. During Walker's final days, his brother Marshall had told him he was going to get him the recognition he deserved. His efforts went largely unnoticed, however, which Marshall suspected was due to Walker's sexual orientation. In 2007, Betty Bean, a reporter for Knoxville's alternative weekly, Metro Pulse, published an article on Walker's life. Walker's former coach Lon Herzbrun and several former teammates, among them Vol Network color analyst Tim Priest and Tennessee head coach Phillip Fulmer, were astonished to learn that Walker's career had mostly gone unnoticed, and began campaigning on his behalf.

History Hague was born in Angaston, South Australia on 8 March 1864, a son of James Hague, who was later a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for Barossa (1890‚Äì1902). Will Hague was educated at a private school in Angaston run by James Leonard. He worked in Adelaide for a time as merchant and Customs agent before returning to Angaston to become a junior partner in the firm of J. & E. Hague. Later he founded the firm of W. Hague & Co., in which he retained the controlling interest until its sale in 1918. Hague believed in the personal interest of parents in the education of their children, and was involved in the Angaston School Board of Advice. He was a member and secretary of the Angaston Agricultural Society. He served as chairman of the District Council of Angaston and trustee of the Angaston Institute. He was for many years a valued correspondent of The Advertiser at Angaston. He had been a strong advocate for the railway to Angaston, believing that railways were essential in the development of the district. In 1912 Hague was elected to the House of Assembly, where he represented the Barossa district for the Liberal Union, and held that seat until his death. In 1913 he became a member of the Railways Standing Committee, and held that post under successive governments. When his close friend the Hon. George Ritchie resigned the post of chairman of the Parliamentary Liberal Party to assume Ministerial office, Hague was elected in his stead, to the benefit to his party. He smoothed many a political disturbance over with a few well-considered words. He resigned this position, with that of chairman of the Railways Standing Committee, when he was appointed Commissioner of Public Works in 1920. In a rearrangement of portfolios some time later Mr. Hague became Treasurer of South Australia, in succession to George Ritchie, and Minister of Railways, and he did much to secure the stability of the finances of the State during an extremely difficult period. In politics he was characterized as having an \\"extreme conscientiousness, allied to a sweet disposition\\", had a \\"commonsense, methodical turn of mind\\" and a \\"high sense of honor\\" and was held in high regard by political friends and opponents alike. He was not afraid to criticize fellow party members A. H. Peake and Sir Richard Butler. He opposed discriminatory measures against settlers of German origin during World War I, and was a supporter of Indigenous Australians. He died at his residence, \\"Kirami\\", Avenue Street, Millswood, South Australia.

Filled with sorrow, Kentaro went to a strip bar and mumbled complains as he loses control of himself in a drunken state. One incident involving him almost hitting a stripper and getting himself kicked out. As he continued his pitiful state, he picked a fight with a butch and her girlfriend for bumping into him and got beaten up. Terrified, he pushed her to the glass, thus bleeding her and escaping to a nearby building on the 4th floor. Unsatisfied with Kentaro and showing off her machoism, the butch continued to pursuit him despite her girlfriend's protest. There he discovered a mannequin in a sailor suit that looks and feels like a real human from the softness of her skin to the realistic pubic hair. Releasing all his repressed feelings, he began to stage a rape scene with the doll. Unfortunately for him, he was then found by the butch and her girlfriend resulting in another beating. After another beating, the butch and her girlfriend got aroused and decided to go to another room to get intimate. As they proceed to fill their desires, they discovered three thugs, who were running away from the yakuza, hiding and observing them. A fight ensued and the butch was shot twice. Thinking she has died, two of the men decided to rape the butch's girlfriend in the room where Kentaro was at. Sensing danger, Kentaro hid from under the bed to avoid any conflict and observed the whole ordeal. After a while, the butch reemerged only to be shot again. The thugs' leader then warned that he will release the girl without shooting her, only if she managed to get out of their sights within ten seconds. As the girl rushed to find her belongings, the girl discovered Kentaro under the bed and decided to reveal his presence as a way to distract the thugs and escape. This proved useless as she ended up getting shot at. Knowing his presence, they proceeded to drag him out and attempt to kill him. Before they were able to do that, the mannequin that he \\"raped\\" came to life, saved him and kill the thugs. Kentaro shocked by the events, fainted and fell asleep as his strength ebbs away. The next morning Kentaro woke up to find the mannequin, in a new set of clothes beside him. Feeling confused, he looked around for the dead bodies that were killed only to realize he hallucinated or dreamt of it the whole night. Looking at his \\"heroine\\", he thanked her by bringing her back home. After a troublesome day reaching home, he decided to name her Kokone. As days passed, he began to form a relationship with Kokone, complaining about his sorrows and talking about his everyday life. Due to his solitude and disappointment, he started experiencing weird things about her. One minute she began to talk and move her like a real human, another minute, she remained stationary like a doll. This confusion led him to madness as he then began to have a raping fantasy with the doll. Unable to find a job due to his bad reputation, he desperately loaned money from loan sharks and gambled. As he began to lose a lot of money, he attempted to commit suicide only for Kokone to save him. This instilled him a desire to come back victorious, which he does when he won a mahjong game with the impossible nine gates. Overjoyed he rushed back to share the good news of his winnings only to discover that Kokone has disappeared. He got very disappointed. This however, was short-lived when he heard Kokone's voice singing on the rooftop. Curious, he went up and found her in a wedding dress playing a piano. This became a blatant fantasy as he then married her and the previous dead characters (the three thugs, butch and her girlfriend) came back to life and embraced his happiness. All of this being done on top of the rooftop. Just as they take a picture for his wedding, the flash brought him back to reality whereby, on his journey back home after his winnings, he remembered jay-walking the street only to stop when he saw a woman who looked exactly like Kokone. Although he was shocked and frozen, he realized an oncoming truck was going to hit them and he rushed to protect the woman from the impact. This resulted in a blank and showed Kentaro in his subconscious mind still struggling to find Kokone. When he arrived at his apartment, in Kokone's place revealed a messed up mannequin with no hair and tears in her eyes, revealing the whole experience as a fantasy of Kentaro.

The municipality existed from 1902 until its dissolution in 1965. The municipality encompassed the whole island of Varalds√∏y and a wide strip of the mainland west of the island. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village area of Varalds√∏y on the southern part of the island, where Varalds√∏y Church is located. View of the southern part of Varalds√∏y island History On 1 January 1902, the southern district of the municipality of Strandebarm was separated to become the new municipality of Varalds√∏y. Initially, Varalds√∏y had a population of 848. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the municipality of Varalds√∏y was dissolved and its lands were split between two neighboring municipalities. The Mundheim area northwest of the island on the mainland (population: 300) was incorporated into Kvam Municipality, and the island of Varalds√∏y and the rest of the mainland area southwest of the island (population: 511) became a part of Kvinnherad Municipality. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Varalds√∏y, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Varalds√∏y was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms.

Duitse Huis is just above the bastion protruding from the center of the city wall towards the foot of the map. The Duitse Huis () is a complex of buildings in the city of Utrecht, Netherlands, protected as a national monument. The older parts date to a monastery of the Bailiwick of Utrecht of the Teutonic Knights founded in 1348. Originally Catholic, the order became Protestant during the Reformation. A military hospital was added in 1823 after the knights had sold the property. The property was sold back to the Bailiwick of Utrecht and a major renovation started in 1992. Some of the older buildings are again the headquarters of the Bailiwick of Utrecht, now a charity, and hold an important collection of medieval manuscripts, coins and pictures. Other buildings, including the former hospital, have been converted into a five-star hotel, the Grand Hotel Karel V. Teutonic Order The Teutonic Order was one of the great Christian military orders, along with the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller. It was mainly active in the Holy Land and the Baltic region, but had many branches in the west to provide sources of funds and of recruits. The Bailiwick of Utrecht of the Teutonic Order (Ridderlijke Duitse Orde Balije van Utrecht) was founded in 1231, initially focused mainly on the spiritual development of its own members. The order held agricultural lands, called commanderies, in different areas of the Netherlands, The knights and priests had taken the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. In 1348 the order built the Duitse Huis as a monastery and headquarters between the city wall and Springweg in Utrecht. The Emperor Charles V (1500-1558) visited Utrecht between 30 December 1545 and 3 February 1546. A meeting of the chapter of the order of the Golden Fleece began on 2 January 1546, attended by Charles V and his sister Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands). Kings Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France, both knights of the order, were present at this important event. The meetings of the chapter and the feasts took place in the Duitse Huis. By 1580 the States of Utrecht were demanding that Catholic institutions such as the Bailiwick be dissolved and their goods used for charity. The land commander in 1579‚Äì1612, Jacob Taets van Amerongen, resisted on the basis that the goods \\"belonged to our Lord the German Master\\", and that the Bailiwick was a knightly institution that served \\"where necessary to fight with weapons for the defence of the Empire against our common arch enemy, the Turk...\\" However, in 1637 the knights formally accepted the protection of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. They remained an order of Teutonic Knights, but were no longer Catholic.

Most of the land commanders of the order were buried there, as were prominent citizens of Utrecht. One bay has survived, just over wide. There were probably seven or eight such bays, and perhaps a small transept. The main building contained the chapter room and the refectory, sometimes called the \\"Queens room\\", where the knights ate. Many dignitaries were entertained with elaborate feasts in the refectory. The commander's house, at right angles to the main building, was closed to the public. The commander's room was on the west side of the first floor, and there were two smaller reception rooms to the east of this floor. The chapter room was renovated in the second half of the 16th century. The work was probably done between 1550 and 1580 to accommodate growing numbers of visiting dignitaries, but may have been undertaken after 1580 due to the ban on public Catholic worship, or in preparation for the 1586 visit by the Calvinist governor-general of the United Provinces, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. The joists above the hall were raised and new corbels were put in. The former Gothic windows were raised and converted to bay windows. The wall posts were moved to give a symmetrical layout with a stone mantelpiece in the center of the north wall. From that date the walls may have been hung with tapestries. In 1674 the monastery was badly damaged by a windstorm. The church was ruined, and it was demolished. The sacristy, main building, kitchen with outbuildings and Commander's house remained standing. The \\"knights room\\" in the commander's house was used as a replacement church. In 1700 the 14th- century facade was truncated. Hospital Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte bought the property in 1807. The French government planned to convert the complex into a military hospital, and the Teutonic Order had to move to a new building on the canal. On 27 February 1811 the Teutonic Order was abolished in the Kingdom of Holland and its estates were confiscated. After the fall of Napoleon and the restoration of the House of Orange, on 8 August 1815 the Bailiwick was revived by royal decree of William I of the Netherlands. During the reign of King William I a very modern hospital building (for the time) was built on the property along the Geertebolwerk. The hospital was completed in 1823, and remained military property until 1990. The Duitse Huis was registered as a national monument on 20 June 1967. The complex was poorly maintained, and for a few years was occupied by squatters. In 1990 the Military Hospital moved to the Uithof.

A major renovation was started in 1992. The 14th century facade was restored during the renovation. In 1995 the Bailiwick of Utrecht moved back into the 15th century Commander's house on the corner of Springweg and Walsteeg. The order has become a charity that assists people with disabilities, the homeless and drug addicts. The Teutonic Order in the Netherlands converted to Calvinism in time, so they were able to preserve their property, including archival records dating back to the start of the 13th century. The Bailiwick of Utrecht has a collection of historical items in the Duitse Huis including many old charters with seals and a collection of medieval coins. The well-preserved archive is open to researchers. The Duitse Huis has several impressive rooms, including the meeting room for the officers of the Bailiwick. The walls have portraits of every Landcommandeur from the order's foundation. All but the most recent are depicted in armor with a mantle over their shoulders. The old buildings, surrounded by tall trees in a fenced area, are an oasis of tranquility in the center of modern Utrecht.

The hospital's wards were converted into hotel rooms and suites. The Grand Hotel Karel V, a five-star hotel, opened in part of the building complex in 1999. The hotel has 121 rooms, conference rooms, a health center, bar, brasserie and restaurant. The former chapter room and former refectory are now dining areas. The remains of a fireplace were found during the renovation on which the double-headed eagle, the emblem of Charles V, was engraved in sandstone. A new fireplace has been built in the same place in the former refectory as the old fireplace with the coat of arms and motto of Charles V. During the restoration archaeologists discovered the remains of a Roman cemetery dating to between 40 BC and 275 AD. This may be associated with the Roman fort of Traiectum. The garden wing was renovated and extended in 2007 and renamed the Roman wing after this discovery. There are traces of the past history of the complex including objects, photographs and historical drawings displayed in locations throughout the hotel.

It was published in Kodansha's Afternoon from 1991 to 1997 and was followed between 2004 and 2008 by a sequel series Gunsmith Cats Burst which included the same characters and situations. The series describes the adventures of young women fighting crime in Chicago, Illinois. Main characters =Rally Vincent= is a gunshop owner by trade, Rally dabbles in bounty hunting to pay the bills. Her father was an Olympic-level marksman who taught Rally about firearms while running a gun store called Gunsmith Cat in Chicago. Her mother, who had wanted Rally to be a violinist, opposed everything to do with guns and eventually was murdered at the store by robbers when trying to file divorce papers on her husband. After her father disappeared to search for her mother's murderers, Rally took over the store as her own venture, and recruited Minnie May as an assistant. Upon making May a partner, the shop became known as \\"Gunsmith Cats\\". A bit reserved when it comes to men, Rally feels most comfortable when discussing firearms. Although her age is 19, her records state that she is 21, the legal age to operate gun shops in Chicago. Her weapon of choice is a first version CZ-75 and she also carries a concealed pistol. Rally drives a blue 1967 model Shelby Mustang Cobra GT500 with white racing stripes, which she cherishes until its destruction in Gunsmith Cats Burst, when it is replaced by a heavily modified Mustang II Cobra. When quarreling with Rally, Minnie May implied that guns and cars were sex substitutes for the virginal Rally; there is arguably an erotic undertone to her fondness for guns and cars. Rally's father is Indian and her mother was English. As a result, she has dark blue eyes, dusky skin, and dark hair. She is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, with great speed and physical agility, and is an expert but reckless driver. Although she does not always respect the letter of the law, she has a strong moral sense of right and wrong and is reluctant to kill unless absolutely necessary. An excellent marksman, she often targets her opponents' trigger fingers or crucial components of their guns in combat rather than going for a lethal shot. As a result, she has sometimes been hunted by criminals angry at their mutilation at her hands. Rally also usually carries a .25 DuO (made by the same company as the CZ-75) with the trigger guard removed, mounted on a spring-loaded frame strapped to her arm for quick access in a tight spot. When her CZ-75 has been unavailable, she relies on a SIG P210, another very high quality weapon, and sometimes carries a back-up gun in an ankle holster. She keeps a precision rifle and shotgun in the trunk of her Shelby; these have included a Walther WA2000 and a SIG 550 Sniper variant. Her first gun, given to her by her father, was an AR-7, a small .22 LR rifle that can be disassembled and the components stored inside the buttstock; she uses this from time to time. Other guns Rally owns and cherishes are a 1960 Colt .25 pocket model, a Beretta 84F, a Walther P38, a Parabellum P'08 (Luger), a Colt Lawman Mk.3 and a Browning Hi-Power. She has occasionally used other weapons, including a Glock 19 and an RG14 \\"Saturday night special\\" revolver when she was completely devoid of other weapons, and she is an expert shot with any firearm she has been shown using. While Irene is her actual name, she chose the alias \\"Rally (or rather, Larry)\\" as a pseudonym and cover name to not clarify her gender and demoralize her clients. It was not clear from the Japanese whether Rally's name is intended to be \\"Irene\\" or \\"Eileen\\" but the official English translation uses Irene. In several European editions of the manga, most notably in the Italian one, it is \\"Aileen\\". Since L's and R's are mostly interchangeable in Japanese to English translations, the main character's name is often translated as Rally Vincent, and this has become the standard. However, at the 1993 Anime America convention Kenichi Sonoda, when asked a question about the character, started his answer with \\"It's Larry, not Rally.\\" This is further backed up in the manga where in one scene she is receiving a fax from Becky (about Riff-Raff), and the note scrawled on it addresses her as Larry. By the end of the series, as her team members and friends head off towards lighter ventures and greener pastures, Rally herself retires from Chicago's underworld and the bounty hunting scene, moving on with her life, yet still honing her marksmanship. =Minnie May= is a self-styled \\"bomb specialist\\", May learned the trade from her boyfriend, Ken Takizawa. While only 17 (in the original English release, her age was raised to 18 since she is depicted performing explicit sexual acts; it was changed back in the Dark Horse revised edition), she is considerably more knowledgeable and mature than the average 17-year-old girl. May ran away from home at 13 for undisclosed reasons and was found and cared for by Ken. When Ken had to go underground for several years, she worked as a prostitute at a brothel in Chinatown - even advancing into teaching other newcomers - before leaving and joining up with Rally to run the gun shop. Her time in the brothel is still a very touchy subject for her, though, and she prefers not to bring it up again, though she is quite proud of the skills she acquired there. When action is called for, May carries a wide range of explosive weapons with her. She typically uses a self-modified grenade called a \\"May Special,\\" a grenade with no materials to cause shrapnel. Perhaps even more impressive is her talent for disguises and acting; she has fooled Ken into thinking she was a boy for several months, blushed and wept on command, imitated the police chief's voice on the phone so well she fools one of his officers, and impersonated a child actress well enough to fool an entire film crew. Drives a Fiat 500 across both manga series. May is tiny and young- appearing for her age, having taken growth-stunting herbal drugs in an effort to stay attractive to Ken (this plot element was modified in the English translation to a condition that she is taking drugs in an attempt to correct). She can pass for a child of ten or twelve and often takes advantage of this. She is very cute - \\"like Minnie Mouse\\", hence her nickname - with blonde hair and blue-green eyes. May is generally cheerful and possesses a great \\"joie de vivre\\". She does have a temper, though, particularly if someone comes down hard on her lover and mentor Ken Takizawa, or if it is suggested that she may not be mature enough to handle a particular assignment. By the end of Gunsmith Cats, May and Ken, married, settle down in a better part of Chicago, with their ties to the world of crime severed, and eventually have a son. =Bean Bandit= Bean bandit is a tall, scar-faced tough-as-nails driver for hire known for his invulnerability. He is typically depicted wearing a steel-padded Kevlar-lined leather jacket, blue jeans and an armored headband. According to sources found in the Riding Bean OAV, his boots, jeans and shirts are all laminated with Kevlar, while his signature jacket is titanium mesh with Kevlar-laminated leather. According to the manga, the jacket is actually a combination of Moose Leather, chain-mail and ceramic plates. Overall, he is an even better driver than Rally, capable of stunt-driver-level feats. He prefers American muscle cars of the 1970s and Fords in particular; a couple of his personal favorites being a modified 1970 Boss 302 Mustang and a supercharged 1971 Mach 1. However, he owns a whole garage full of famous muscle-car models and is often seen driving a 1968 Chevrolet Corvette C3 fitted with an ultra- rare LS-7. Despite his impressive collection, he has further aspirations: in his signature story arc, he tells Rally about his desire to build his own car, \\"from the chassis on up\\", an original, designed to his specifications. At the time he had already paid a designer over three hundred thousand dollars, and it debuts in the eighth story arc. He dubs this monstrous gas-guzzler the 'Buff' (as in African Cape Buffalo). It is a blueprinted, supercharged 427 cubic-inch displacement engine(dyno'd at 500 BHP), with not only armor plating and bulletproof glass, but a reinforced frame, specifically designed to be bulletproof from the ground up-all but indestructible. It can drive sideways and has special air brakes and wheel spikes to aid in sudden stops. The Buff is very similar in design to the Ford RS200, a Group B rally car made in the 1980s. Considering Bean's preference for Fords throughout the series, the design similarities are very likely to be deliberate. Bean insists on following his strict rules of engagement in all circumstances, and sticks to his word (and he expects his business partners to do the same). Although he doesn't shy away from violence, he prefers to remain neutral when he can and collect his hefty driving fees for almost any kind of job. He will work for criminals and legitimate interests alike as long as he is paid as agreed, although after a competition against Rally about a Kerasine delivery (see Goldie's entry) he has agreed not to deliver any more drugs. He will charge hefty penalties to employers who break his terms; his only Achilles heel is a protective instinct towards children and noncombatants. Bean is huge and muscular, towering over most people. He can perform amazing feats of strength (like ripping the door off a car with one hand) and shrug off most injuries. Even a pistol shot to his armored headband will barely slow him down. He prefers knives to guns, and can throw a knife straight through a car windscreen with deadly accuracy. He has long black hair, darkish skin and brown eyes, and his race is not determined. However, in interviews, Sonoda has implied that Bean's amazing traits are a result of him being a mix of the strongest characteristics from many different races. Bean Bandit is also the star of a 1989 original video animation and manga, written by Sonoda, called Riding Bean. In this separate story, Bean and a blonde Rally are partners and have a close, but professional, friendship. At the end of Gunsmith Cats, his recent scuffle with Percy Bacharach, an aggressive and otherwise reckless officer with a long history with Bean, has him leaving the Chicago scene for a while, although he still keeps offering his services outside of the state of Illinois. =Becky Farrah= \\"Becky the Nose\\" is Rally's main source of information on all the goings on in the Chicago underworld. While her fees are high and she can come across as money-grubbing, most if not all of her information is legitimate; she is also known for working in finding missing persons. When she is not chasing after Rally for her payment, the two share a friendship that crosses business lines. Becky eventually withdraws from the Chicago underworld in the end and uses her scouting skills in investment and business, although her friends remind her when it borders on insider trading. Becky wears glasses with a ponytail and is usually businesslike in appearance. She can be seen driving a BMW 2002 Turbo. Bought a BMW 3 Series Compact in Gunsmith Cats Burst after selling the 2002 to Misty. =Ken Takizawa= An explosives expert by trade, he learned his craft through a combination of his connections to the Chicago underworld and on the set of Hollywood movies. In addition to being Minnie May's on-again off-again boyfriend, he taught her everything he knows. Ken is Japanese-American and about 20 years older than May. He also suffers from multiple sclerosis, which affects his ability to handle sensitive explosives. At the end of the series, he and May open up an anime and Japanese hobby store in Chicago after their honeymoon to Osaka, and have a son. As a personal joke, he uses the nickname \\"Ken Taki\\", which is similar to the Japanese pronunciation of the state Kentucky as well as the fast food franchise, \\"kentakkƒ´\\". =Misty Brown= An expert sneak thief and burglar, she is caught by Rally and Minnie-May but joins them upon her subsequent release from jail. Like May, she moves into Rally's house and helps both in the shop and in the pursuit of fugitives, where her lock-picking skills prove useful. Misty doesn't carry any guns but is quite adept in the use of knives, wielded and thrown. She is a lesbian and has a crush on Rally, although later on she becomes Goldie's lover. Drives Becky's BMW 2002 Turbo after it was sold to her cheaply by Becky in Gunsmith Burst. =Roy Coleman= A detective of the Chicago Police, Roy is Rally's main contact with the force. Acting as more of an older brother at times, he watches out for Rally when she's in trouble. While considerably older than Rally, he still enjoys spending time with her, as it gives him a sense of belonging to the younger generation, and a contact of his own in the same generation. Initially drive a Volkswagen Beetle but totalled it and changed to a Volkswagen Golf Mk 1 before changing again to a red Ford Sierra XR4i. At the end of the series, not content with workings of the Chicago Police Department after Percy Bacharach's recent attempt to capture Bean Bandit and violations of protocol, Roy transfers out to the Rosemount department. =Riff-Raff= A wild female courier driver, much like Bean Bandit. While working on the wrong side of the law, she has deep within herself a sense of honor which does not let her betray anyone she has taken sympathy to, and becomes a sort-of friend of Bandit, Rally and company. Her greatest dream is to become the best courier driver and outdo Bean himself. She is extremely proud of her driving skills and once belted Bean in the jaw after he had made a crack about her car being an automatic. She can be seen driving an AC Cobra 427; because of her skill with it, she has adopted the name \\"Snake Charmer\\". Her appearance was modeled after the character Luffy from the anime series Gall Force, to which Kenichi Sonoda also provided the character designs while he worked for ARTMIC.  Antagonists  In Gunsmith Cats, Chicago has many large-scale criminals and outlaws, each crossing paths with Rally & company over the course of the series. =Bonnie and Clyde= A fictional take on a factual pair, Bonnie and Clyde Dorman are a brother-sister pair of hired guns: Bonnie operates in Chicago, while Clyde runs with an outfit in Mexico. Bonnie's first encounter with Rally costs both of her legs and her right thumb; after Clyde facilitates her escape from jail, Bonnie takes to wearing specially-designed prosthetic limbs with weapons inside them, and becomes obsessed with evening the score. Together Bonnie and Clyde hatch a scheme to steal from the local drug cartels, get revenge on Rally, then sneak out of town and retire. They are nearly successful, but are slain in a brief and chaotic firefight. =Gray= A drug lord and gang leader, Gray runs a large cocaine distribution ring in Chicago. During a fateful encounter with Rally, she relieved him of one of his hands by means of a shotgun; henceforth, he sports a prosthetic hook hand. He is eventually caught and imprisoned, though he continues to run his drug ring from his cell. Through his many connections, he is eventually released and swears vengeance on Rally (and is eventually killed in his pursuit, right after confessing his love for Rally). =Jones= A small-time drug dealer, first seen with his driver, Riff-Raff. =Borgnine= A mysterious figure involved in the 'Kidnapped' story arc. In order to draft stage magician and hypnotist Mr. Smart as an accomplice in a heist, Borgnine seduces Smart's estranged wife and fits his daughter Jeena with an explosive collar, which can be detonated via cell phone anytime. Rally is hired by Jeena's friends to rescue Jeena and save Mr. Smart's reputation. Borgnine proves to be a dangerous adversary, but his greed and treachery eventually lead to his demise. =Goldie Musou= Arguably the most ruthless of Rally's opponents. Of Italian ancestry, \\"Iron Goldie\\" is a high-ranking member of a mob family in Sicily. Many call her a Mafia Queen. She is an incredible hand-to-hand combatant, and is quite skilled at creating complex plans, which, though often successful, often make plain her cavalier attitude towards her subordinates. She is a pathological personality, the textbook definition of a \\"control freak.\\" She is obsessed with controlling everything and everyone around her. People who resist her successfully, such as Rally, become even more attractive to her. She is a lesbian, though she tends to express it as a form of sadistic pedophilia. She keeps a trademark harem of young girls who have murdered their parents while under the influence of her drugs. Goldie and Rally crossed paths many times, and the bounty hunter is usually quite lucky to escape with her life and the lives of her friends. However, this is far better than any of Goldie's previous opponents have done, and repeated escapes quickly turn the mobster's appreciation for her skills into a dedicated sexual obsession. Finally, Goldie decides that she will make Rally her masterpiece - a slave broken to her will through sheer psychological torture, without the aid of drugs. The linchpin of her power base is psychopharmacology, or the use of hallucinogenic drugs similar to LSD. With a valedictorian in pharmaceuticals, over the years she has developed an incredibly effective method of mind control. The first thing she does after she gains chemical control of someone she considers a worthy \\"pet\\" is order him or her to kill his or her loved ones. The alternative to the chemically-induced fantasy world she had built for her puppets is a reality where they have murdered everyone who cared for them. She has yet to lose control of a subject whom she has completely enslaved. Her current empire is based on a powerful designer drug called Kerasine, which is also a major plot device of the series. It is a compound that she knows how to produce cheaply but has yet to be reverse-engineered by chemists outside of her organization. Its popularity is due to both its low cost and its ability to produce the effects of several different drugs: a small amount is a stimulant like cocaine, a larger amount is a euphoric similar to heroin, and the entire contents of a vial combines both with a powerful hallucinogenic effect similar to lysergic acid diethylamide. All this comes with a nasty side effect - a user of the drug can be given hypnotic commands while he or she is under its influence. Currently, it is the most popular drug in the world of the manga. Several storylines detail Rally's efforts to prevent Goldie from flooding Chicago with this mind-bending substance, including one which involves using Rally's father, through Kerasine inducement, in which he becomes Goldie's personal assassin. However, despite her malicious actions and otherwise antagonistic qualities, Goldie's plans and desires were often intentioned for means other than a lust for power and dominance over the criminal underworld out of spiteful reasons. By the end of Gunsmith Cats, it was revealed that Kerasine was created as a designer drug that would be addictive yet without negative side effects, allowing for a drug that would not harm consumers and thus, higher profits, and through her influence, that she would use that to establish an honorable and stable order of criminal activity and \\"necessary evil\\" in Chicago, wiping out gangs and syndicates with otherwise greedy or selfish intentions and dishonorable and disreputable reputations for breaking deals and cruel intrigues that were also affecting society in a worse way. After losing her memory in her final battle with Rally in the original series, she regains it after Rally and Misty get tangled up in a turf war between Goldie and the more hostile Mafia fractions, in which course Rally saves Goldie's life. In the end Goldie and Rally part on a truce, especially since Misty has (more or less voluntarily) joined Goldie as her lover. Anime =William \\"Bill\\" Collins= An agent in the Chicago office of the A.T.F., Bill Collins comes across as a sleazy, nosy government agent who fancies himself as Eliot Ness. He is investigating a gun-running operation, but has run into a lot of dead leads, as well as a few dead agents. Desperate for help, he 'enlists' Rally and May's help by holding up the gun shop's license as insurance. Although they had success at first by shutting down a distribution point in Chicago, Jonathan Washington, the lone witness, along with five A.T.F. agents, are assassinated by in a safehouse by Natasha Radinov, using Collins' cardkey and access code to gain entry. Now the investigation is due to be closed and Collins soon discovers a conspiracy within the A.T.F., which involves his superior George Black and mayoral candidate Edward Haints who has Rally as a target. =George Black= Collins' superior in the A.T.F. Chicago office, George Black is revealed to be part of a gun-running operation which he co-ran with Edward Haints, an Illinois assemblyman running for mayor in Chicago under a gun-control platform. It was Black who contracts Natasha Radinov to kill Jonathan Washington, the only witness to the operation, for which he provided her with a cardkey with Collins' ID, as well as Rally and May for helping Collins. He also supplies Radinov with the use of a supposedly shut-down A.T.F. safehouse for her to stay in. But after the first attempt to kill Rally fails, Black files a vacation leave and decides to flee the country. He goes to the safehouse where he knows Radinov is, but soon discovers that his partner Haints was talking to Radinov on the phone, with Radinov aiming her pistol at him. Realizing he has been double-crossed, he tries to persuade Radinov to tell Haints not to kill him, but to no avail. Radinov kills him. =Natasha Radinov= Also known as \\"Bloody Pierce\\", Natasha Radinov is initially an agent for the K.G.B. and Spetsnaz, but after the fall of the Soviet Union, she contracts her services out as a freelance assassin. She is proficient in almost every deadly hand weapon in the world, but prefers to work with silent weapons, especially a Welrod silenced pistol and a ballistic knife designed for Spetsnaz use. She also wears a long coat lined with ballistic nylon and Kevlar, the inside lining holding a vast arsenal of weapons. Radinov prefers to be paid for her services in heroin, which she sells in Russia; she personally stays away from the drug herself. Recently, she had accepted an assignment to kill Rally and May because the two had interfered in a gun-running operation run by Edward Haints, an Illinois assemblyman running for mayor under a gun-control platform. However, when the first attempt fails, and Radinov is injured because of it, she takes it as \\"a matter of pride\\" and went after Rally personally. After a violent chase, Radinov is killed by Rally thanks to several shots to the chest at close range. =Edward Haints= A senator in the Illinois General Assembly, Edward Haints is running for mayor of Chicago. His campaign style has him wrapping himself in an \\"All American\\" theme, which favors heavily on protecting the city's citizens by instituting stricter gun- access laws. In truth, Haints runs one of the biggest gun-running operations in the state, and the strict gun laws he plans to enact will enable him to raise the prices of his own illicit operations. When Bill Collins gets a little too close with his investigations, he asks his friend and partner George Black to hire Natasha Radinov to kill the witnesses and derail the investigation. However, Haints also hires Radinov to kill Black as well, mostly to keep the profits of his gun-running to himself. However, Roy Coleman's partner disguises herself as Radinov and has Becky Farra videotape a meeting between her and Haints, exposing Haints' plot. =Jonathan Washington= At the beginning of the series, Jonathan Washington had skipped bail for drug smuggling charges, only to be captured by Rally Vincent. In truth, Washington has been working for Edward Haints' gun-running ring and operates an entire warehouse filled with illicit firearms... firearms that Rally, with a little \\"help\\" from Bill Collins, were able to prevent hitting the streets. However, since Washington is a vital witness to the gun ring, he is taken to an A.T.F. safehouse outside Chicago. He tries to persuade Rally to help him escape the safehouse because he now fears for his life. He knows that George Black, the head of the A.T.F.'s Chicago office, is also a partner of Haints and has now dispatched an assassin to kill him. When Rally refuses to help him escape, he leaves a fake Rolex watch and a scrap of paper with the address of his \\"daughter\\" on it with May. In fact, the paper holds an Internet address and the watch has an access code to the shipping dates of the gun ring engraved on the back of the watchband's latch. True to his warning, Washington does meet his demise when Natasha Radinov, using a copy of Collins' cardkey and access code, enters the safehouse, and kills Washington and the A.T.F agents guarding him.

They constitute a layer, or an annulus/ shell, of lipids which are partially immobilized due to the existence of lipid-protein interactions. Polar headgroups of these lipids bind to the hydrophilic part of the membrane protein(s) at the inner and outer surfaces of lipid bilayer membrane. The hydrophobic surface of the membrane proteins is bound to the apposed lipid fatty acid chains of the membrane bilayer. For integral membrane proteins spanning the thickness of the membrane bilayer, these annular/shell lipids may act like a lubricating layer on the proteins' surfaces, thereby facilitating almost free rotation and lateral diffusion of membrane proteins within the 2-dimensional expanse of the biological membrane(s). Outside the layer of shell/annular lipids, lipids are not tied down to protein molecules. However, they may be slightly restricted in their segmental motion freedom due to mild peer pressure of protein molecules, if present in high concentration, which arises from extended influence of protein-lipid interaction. Membrane areas away from protein molecules contain lamellar phase bulk lipids, which are largely free from any restraining effects due to protein-lipid interactions. Thermal denaturation of membrane proteins may destroy the secondary and tertiary structure of membrane proteins, exposing newer surfaces to membrane lipids and therefore increasing the number of lipids molecules in the annulus/shell layer. This phenomenon can be studied by the spin label electron paramagnetic resonance technique.

It is located in the Duitse Huis complex of buildings, including part of the old monastery of the Bailiwick of Utrecht of the Teutonic Knights founded in 1348. Most of the rooms and suites are in a former military hospital, which dates from 1823 and has been carefully renovated, or in the modern Roman wing opened in 2008. The hotel contains a Roman-themed health center, conference rooms (Events Karel 5), a bar, Bistro Karel 5 and Restaurant Karel 5. It is set in extensive grounds. Building history In 1348 the Bailiwick of Utrecht of the noble Teutonic Order (Ridderlijke Duitse Orde Balije van Utrecht) built the Duitse Huis as a monastery and headquarters between the Utrecht city wall and Springweg. In the sixteenth century, Charles the Fifth (Karl V), who was emperor of the German Empire, king of Spain and sovereign ruler of the seventeen Netherlands' provinces, stayed at this monastery which by then also served as a hospital. By 1580, when the Reformation was introduced in Utrecht, the Teutonic Order converted to Protestantism but it maintained the building as a hospital. Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte bought the property in 1807 and the Teutonic Order left the premises. During the reign of King William I of the Netherlands a military hospital was built on the property along the Geertebolwerk. For its time, the hospital was very modern. It was completed in 1823. When the hospital became vacant in the late 1980s the Bailiwick of Utrecht was able to repurchase the property. A major renovation was started in 1992. In 1995 the Bailiwick of Utrecht moved back into the 15th century Commander's house on the corner of Springweg and Walsteeg. Further renovations converted much of the rest of the complex into a hotel and restaurant by 1999. The building was restored with help from the National Restoration Fund. The hospital's wards were converted into hotel rooms and suites. As far as possible the old fabric and appearance were preserved. The garden wing was renovated and extended in 2007. During the excavation archaeologists discovered the remains of a Roman cemetery dating to between 40 BC and 275 AD, which may be associated with the Roman fort of Traiectum. The wing was called the Roman wing after this discovery. The Roman Wing is called \\"contemporary\\" by reviewers, in contrast to the \\"cleverly modernized\\" main building. It was designed by the Heine & van de Rijt architectural firm and Hylkema Consultants. The wing has a modern pavilion and extension of the existing garden wing. It was formally opened in November 2008 with a ceremony that included marching Roman soldiers. Facilities The Grand Hotel Karel V opened in 1999. It is named after the Emperor Charles V, who once visited the Duitse Huis. A formal opening ceremony with the mayor of Utrecht and a representative of the queen was held on 10 September 2000. At this ceremony the hotel received its five star rating, the first in the Utrecht region. The hotel has 121 rooms, conference rooms, a health center, bar, bistro and restaurant. The auditorium seats 114 people. There is an unobtrusive sound system in the conference facility and public areas of the hotel. The hotel has three wings.

Traces of the past history of the complex, including objects, photographs and historical drawings, are displayed throughout the hotel. The hotel is set in extensive gardens. Restaurants Bistro Karel 5 is in the former convent kitchen, and has a terrace that is open in good weather. The chapter room and refectory of the main building of the medieval Duitse Huis are now also dining areas. The remains of a fireplace were found during the renovation on which the double- headed eagle, the emblem of Charles V, was engraved in sandstone. A new fireplace was built in the refectory in the same place as the old fireplace, decorated with the coat of arms and motto of the Emperor Charles V. A 2004 guide said the Bistro Karel 5 could be enjoyed in a casual atmosphere, and the classic Restaurant Karel 5 offered an excellent choice. Restaurant Karel 5 received a Michelin star in 2005, but lost it in 2013 after a change in chefs. Restaurant Karel 5 held the star in the period 2005‚Äì2013. As of June 2014 Gault Millau showed the restaurant rating as 14 points.

It was the first live album to be recorded in stereo in Ireland. It was their sixth LP for Columbia Records and, unusually for the group, included two newly composed songs in the folk style. Music critic Joe Goldberg wrote the liner notes. Music on the album The album contained the first recording of \\"Lament for Brendan Behan,\\" a recently composed tribute to the late Irish author, Brendan Behan, whom the Clancys had personally known. Tommy Makem wrote \\"The Curlew's Song\\" for the album. Two more songs, \\"Butcher Boy\\" and \\"Beggar Man\\" (a.k.a. \\"The Little Beggarman\\"), Makem learned from his mother, Sarah, a source singer for folk song collectors. The sound fades briefly at the end of \\"Beggar Man\\" when Makem danced a jig onstage as the audience cheered. The group learned \\"Wild Rover\\" from Luke Kelly of The Dubliners, with whom they were friends. They sang the number \\"Wella Wallia\\" (a.k.a. \\"Weile Waile\\" and \\"The River Saile\\") for laughs, using fake Dublin accents to the delight of the audience. As was standard in their concerts, Tom Clancy recited the opening lines of James Joyce's novel, Finnegans Wake before the group sang \\"New Finnegan's Wake.\\" Reception Billboard chose the album as a \\"Special Merit Pick.\\" The magazine's reviewer called the album \\"a happy package, packed with lots of folk zing.\\" The reviewer also noted how the group had \\"an exuberant audience for their exuberant style\\" during the live concert. Other versions A special mono version (XLP-78272-1A/XLP-78273-1A) of the album released only in Canada in 1965 contains some spoken material that is not included on the U.S. and British releases. On this mono LP, Paddy Clancy introduces the song, \\"The Rocks of Bawn\\"; on the standard version, there is no spoken introduction before the number. The dialogue before \\"Maid of Fife\\" is also longer, and Tom Clancy makes a comment after \\"New Finnegan's Wake\\" before the concert's intermission. This version also switches the order of the songs, \\"Wild Rover\\" and \\"Nightingale.\\" The American version of the LP was released in the United Kingdom by CBS Records in both stereo and mono versions.

Background Eubank attended Amherst College where he majored in English and Literature. He has drawn inspiration from his studying of literature, saying in an interview that he is especially influenced by the \\"weird, idiosyncratic characters in the Russian canon\\". While writing The Signal, Eubank drew on numerous personal experiences.

The film features a number of flashbacks to East Coast cross country races, and the main characters are placed in a number of situations of physical peril. While working on the script, Eubank was affected by his 2011 attempt to summit Mount Everest in which his climbing partner died during the expedition.

It was painted between 1785 and 1787. Background During her years in the public eye, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire was painted several times by both Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds. Gainsborough's painting of her around 1785, in a large black hat (a style which she made fashionable, and came to be known as the 'Gainsborough' or 'portrait' hat), has become famous for its history. After having been lost from Chatsworth House for many years, it was discovered in the 1830s in the home of an elderly schoolmistress, who had cut it down somewhat in order to fit it over her fireplace. In 1841 she sold it to a picture dealer for ¬£56, and he later gave it to a friend, the art collector Wynne Ellis. When Ellis died, the painting went for sale at Christie's in London in 1876, where it was bought by the Bond Street art dealer William Agnew for the then astronomical sum of 10,000 guineas, at the time the highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. Three weeks later it was stolen from the London gallery of Thomas Agnew & Sons, a theft that was highly publicised at the time, and for years the newspapers printed stories about claimed sightings of the painting.The Sydney Mail 13 October 1877: Gainsborough's \\"Duchess of Devonshire\\" Retrieved 2012-01-29Number One London 26 May 2010: Duchess of Devonshire Stolen Retrieved 29 July 2012 However, not until 25 years later did it become known that the thief had been the notorious \\"Napoleon of Crime\\", Adam Worth. He had intended to sell it to come up with the bail to release his brother from prison, but when his brother was freed without bail, he decided to keep it for himself, for \\"a rainy day\\", and brought it to his homeland, the United States. In early 1901, through the American detective agency Pinkerton's, he negotiated a return of the painting to Agnew's son for $25,000. The portrait and payment were exchanged in Chicago in March 1901, and a couple of months later the painting arrived in London and was put up for sale. The Wall Street financier J. P. Morgan immediately travelled to England to obtain the painting and later claimed to have paid $150,000 for it. The painting remained in Morgan's family until 1994, when it was put up for sale at Sotheby's and was purchased by the 11th Duke of Devonshire for the Chatsworth House collection for $408,870.

Both have been designated (through The Lacassane Company) by the Corps of Engineers as a mitigation bank providing ecosystem services to the public in the form of Environmental mitigation (compensatory mitigation) to ensure the no net loss wetlands policy is followed to prevent Biodiversity loss that keeps the greenhouse debt in check. The Lacassane Company partnered with The Coastal Plain Conservancy to hold conservation servitudes on the land. The banks are monitored and maintained by Wildlands, Inc., an environmental consulting and plant propagation company. The company operations now include land leases for waterfowl (Waterfowl Limited Liability Company) and other hunting, cattle grazing, alligator hide and egg harvesting, oil and gas exploration, and wetland projects. A pumping system through canals, laterals, the Bell City ditch, the Lacassine Bayou and the Mermentau River provides irrigation for the farming operations. The company's SIC code (Lessors of Real Property, NEC) is 6519 and the NAICS CODE (Lessors of Other Real Estate Property) is 531190. = Seed Propagation Project = In 2006, The Lacassane Company became the parent company of Louisiana Native Seed Company, that provides ecospecies such as Little Bluestem, Brownseed Paspalum, Florida Paspalum, Switchgrass, Partridge Pea, and Eastern Gamagrass and has consultants with experience in Agricultural science and botany. The Louisiana Native Seed Company is listed as a provider for the United States Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service. = The Lacassane Club = The Lacassane Club was founded in 2013, as a subsidiary of The Lacassane Company, on 14,000 of the 21,000 acres owned by the company.

He is known to have sailed together with Trist√£o da Cunha, and to have explored R√≠o de La Plata and possibly the San Matias Gulf, around 1511-12. The Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen erroneously stated that he was in Ferdinand Magellan circumnavigation voyage. He is the author of a Treatise on the Nautical Needle, dated 1514, which is extant in a later copy included in an undated (ca. 1550?) Portuguese nautical atlas. He died in 1525 while traveling in the Indian Ocean.

The maps of the Tratado clearly date from after 1514. For instance, it shows the Magellan Strait or Japan (which was only reported by the Portuguese in 1543). On the other hand, the position of certain Portuguese flags is not consistent with historical events; in particular in one of the charts, Portuguese castles are drawn in Inca territory, something that was never reported in any official document.

The magazine editor Joseph Freeman was his brother. Background Freeman's family came from Piratin near Lviv, part of the Poltava district in the Ukraine, then in the Russian empire. His parents, Stella and Isaac Freeman, were Jewish and lived in the Pale of Settlement as per anti-semitic laws of the Tsarist regime. His parents worked as shopkeepers.Joseph Freeman, An American Testament: A Narrative of Rebels and Romantics. (New York: Octagon Books, 1973), pp. 4-5. Freeman graduated from Cornell University with a degree in history.Chambers, Whittaker, Witness (New York: Random House, 1952), pp. 217 Career In his 1952 memoir, Whittaker Chambers called Freeman \\"the best mind that I was to meet among the American Communist intellectuals.\\" Freeman brought Chambers to work at the Daily Worker newspaper: both had recently joined the Communist Party (then using the name the Workers Party of America), Freeman was \\"writing foreign news.\\" Chambers met his wife when he was covering the 1926 Passaic Strike with Freeman. Freeman and Chambers signed a petition with colleagues (including Sender Garlin, Vern Smith, and John Loomis Sherman) that asked the Central Committee of the Communist Party to have Louis Engdahl removed as editor. Later, Freeman took over the copy desk, while Chambers succeeded him on foreign news (later in turn succeeded by James S. Allen). In 1929, he succeeded his brother at TASS and lived with his wife Vera Schaap (wife of Al Schaap, a Young Communist League founder) and his brother Joseph in an apartment on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights, rented from Eugene Lyons (formerly with TASS, by then with United Press correspondent in Moscow). Chambers recalled Freeman's guests included Sender Garlin, Abe Magill, James S. Allen, Joseph North (of the Daily Worker and New Masses), Anna Rochester, Grace Hutchins, Nadya Pavlov, and Kenneth Durant.

As direct references to prostitution would not be acceptable, the ads were carefully worded with terms such as large chest for sale.Villains' Paradise: Britain's Underworld from the Spivs to the Krays Donald Thomas In larger cities, tart cards were placed in phone boxes. By the year 2000, the Internet, and access to it had grown large enough for some in the sex industry to see it as a marketing tool. As use of the Internet has grown, so has the use of it by the sex industry. In 2007 Harriet Harman, then Minister for Women, put pressure on the Newspaper Society to not carry sex ads. As a result, the Newspaper Society updated its guidelines for members in 2008 effectively banning sex ads.Shun sex ads, local papers urged BBC 11 February 2008 As the majority of local newspapers are members, this ban added to the swing towards the Internet. Mobile devices such as smartphones have further increased the use of the Internet both generally and for prostitution websites.How do we use the Internet and mobile devices in 2014? EConsultancy 7 August 2014 In the Netherlands, the Internet had grown in importance by the mid 2010s as a platform for recruiting prostitutes' clients, with escort workers advertising their mobile telephone numbers online. Types of websites =Listing sites= There has been a rise in the number of escort/prostitution listing websites, that advertise for both independent and agency escorts. Some are free, while others charge to add a listing. Others are free for a basic listing but charge for some additional features. A notable example is the website The Erotic Review. =Forums= Forums were amongst the first sites to be used by escorts. With the rise of other social media, their use has declined. =Personal websites= It has become simple and easy for independent escorts to create a personal website for the purposes of advertising their prostitution services. Reviews A number of sites have a section where clients can leave reviews for escorts. Some outside the industry regard this as degrading to the escort;Arnold Schwarzenegger told by Harriet Harman to shut prostitute website Daily Telegraph 30 September 2009 however, most involved in the industry do not share this view. The practice of posting online reviews of escorts dates back to 1999 when The Erotic Review, a review site that allows customers to rate their experiences with sex workers, was created. Punternet was originally the foremost review site despite adverse publicity from Harriet Harman and Vera Baird (see below). In recent years, Adultwork has had a larger number of reviews posted. UK Punting, founded in 2010, is a sex worker review website which only includes client comments and has no input from sex workers. Books reviewing the providers of sexual services in the United Kingdom have been published by George McCoy since 1996 and by 2013 McCoy was running a website reviewing over 5,000 massage parlours and individuals. Warnings and ugly mugs One feature of some early sites, particularly forums, were sections where warnings about \\"dodgy punters\\" (and to a lesser degree, bad escorts) could be posted. As these warnings were spread over about a dozen sites, keeping up with warnings that may be applicable to an individual was time-consuming. In 2006, talks took place in the industry about setting up a centralised warning site with warnings being fed by RSS from the existing sites. It was agreed the newly formed Saafe site would carry the centralised warnings.Saafe Centralised Warnings Archived by Wayback Machine 8 February 2007 This went live in January 2007. Unfortunately, the centralised warnings did not work as well as envisaged and was eventually dropped in 2010.

PressKing 11 September 2013 Controversies =Punternet= In 2009 Harriet Harman asked then California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to ban the website as 'Punternet' fuels the demand for prostitution‚Äîa vice she said degrades women and puts them at risk. (Although a site for prostitution in the UK, it is run from California.) The website was not closed down and received an increase in traffic from the publicity. The website owners thanked Harman for the increase in business. In January 2010 at a Westminster Hall debate on Violence against Women, then Solicitor General Vera Baird again called for the site to be taken down.Solicitor General takes fresh pop at PunterNet The Register 26 January 2010 In 2018 Trishna Datta, an outreach worker from Ilford, Essex, launched a petition to have the Punternet website taken down. She said that website lacked adequate safety measures to ensure details which could put sex workers in danger were not revealed. Additionally she expressed concern that some of the sex workers reviewed on the site might be underage or victims of trafficking or sexual assault. Punternet commented that they would report underage prostitutes to the authorities, and that they encourage customers to report underage prostitutes and victims of trafficking to Crimestoppers UK. =Bogus escort agencies scam= In 2010, Suffolk Trading standards started Operation Troy, targeting bogus online escort agencies. These agencies promised large earnings in an effort to recruit escorts.

It is native to the eastern United States where it occurs primarily in the Ohio River basin; it is present in the states of Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky with a small population in Virginia. It is a large darter, growing to long, orange-red with black vertical barring on its body, and horizontal barring on its front dorsal fin. Its typical habitat is swift-flowing riffles with rubble, boulder and gravel. No major threats have been identified for this fish and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description E. variatum is large in size for its family; it has an average length of between two and a half to three and a half inches (5 to 10 cm). It has a wide variety of markings. There is a red-orange band on its dorsal fin, which is followed by a blue-green band and a red-brown band at the edge of the fin. There are also red spots located on its other fins. This darter has large pectoral fins, which are used to keep the fish upright in the fast-moving streams it inhabits. It also has four to six saddles along its back. Three to four of these saddles tend to be dark and visible while the remaining saddles are not. Habitat E. variatum lives in small and medium rivers and streams. They tend to live within riffles that contain small rocks. The darter will tend to live in the fastest flowing riffles. In order to survive, it needs rivers and streams with high water quality. Due to this attribute, the fish is often viewed as an indicator of good water quality. The darter lives predominately in the states of Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky. It has also been found within Virginia, although only rarely. Behavior =Diet= The diet of E. variatum consists of crustaceans, insect larvae and other aquatic invertebrates. =Reproduction= During the early spring, males establish spawning territory, which will occur from April to May. After spawning, the eggs are laid in riffles by females, who will bury them with pebbles. After the eggs are buried, they are abandoned by the parents. Status The population trend of this fish seems to be stable and it is a common species with numerous sub-populations over a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Its official address is 15900 Carrs Mill Road in Lisbon, Maryland. Carr's Mill is the second official landfill built in Howard County, Maryland which operated from 1953‚Äì1977. Howard County's first landfill was New Cut in Ellicott City, Maryland which operated from 1944‚Äì1980. Alpha Ridge Landfill operated between 1980‚Äì1997 before the county switched to offsite waste disposal. \\"Bushy Park\\" and \\"Carrs Mill\\" The namesake millhouse was situated on the northern portion of an estate, near the intersection of modern Bushy Park Road and Carrs Mill Road. Carr's Mill is part of the original estate of Charles Alexander Warfield. Warfield married Elizebeth Ridgley of Laurel in 1771 and settled in a log home at \\"Bushy Park\\" in Glenwood, Maryland. The same year he started construction on his slave plantation manor home. The property later was owned by the \\"Hammond\\" family of the Major Charles Family line. The manor stood for over 150 years, burning in 1933 and demolished in 1947. A new house was built over the original foundation. In 1978 the property was purchased by the Clevenger family and had been subdivided down to 342 acres, but was still actively farmed. In 1983 it had been subdivided down to a 190-acre parcel named \\"Bushy Park Farm\\" and sold again. A portion of the original estate became the Carr's mill landfill. Warfield is buried at Bushy Park. The walled cemetery remains, but the majority of the 1300 acre farm has been redeveloped as the Western Regional Park, operated by Howard County. Environmental Both Carr's Mill and New Cut landfill were reaching capacity in the early 1970s. With the approval and construction of the Rouse Company development Columbia, the population of the county would quadruple while the landfill was in operation. County executive Edward L. Cochran was already starting the controversial process of selection of a new site, when Carr's Mill became a site of hazardous waste dumping by Western Electric in 1976. Howard County spent millions of dollars to cap the landfill and dispose of hazardous materials after contamination of groundwater on the site. In July 1976, an anonymous tip stated that Francis \\"sonny\\" Bohager was bribed $250 from F.P.R Bohager & Sons Inc of Fells Point to allow hazardous waste onsite. Police intercepted two Bohager trucks dumping 101 barrels hazardous materials from Farboil Paint Co. on Key Highway and Western Electric Company by the service road of Carr's Mill. Western Electric had contracted the company to haul 2,700 barrels of hazardous waste in 1976. In July 1976, police reported barrels of hazardous waste were reported to be found buried at the landfill, but were not investigated further. In December, a task force selecting new landfill sites offered Carrs Mill as a site for landfill consolidation for Western Howard County before shipment out of county which was only implemented at the historic Trinity Church property in Elkridge. Carrs Mill ceased operations in 1977. In 1991, contaminants were discovered in test wells at the landfill site. In 1993, 900 drums of waste were found at the same location where the uninvestigated barrels were reported. 30 more were found in September in an overgrown area feeding into the Cattail creek by Geo-Trans, who was performing a $7.8 million contamination investigation at all three landfill sites. Metal detector tests found 100 more drums within 100 ft. John J. O'Hara, chief of the Howard County Bureau of Environmental Services announced to the press there was no way of finding who dumped the toxic waste, despite a police report, markings on the barrels, and a County effort to fine the companies. Ground water tests revealed Trichloroethylene and a form of dichlorothene level far higher than EPA limits. In 1994, the county held an evening meeting announced that day in the Baltimore Sun, to inform residents about the 840 drums found so far by posting a copy of the report in the Public works Building in Ellicott City. A $2.4 million mitigation plan removed 4,000 tons of soil, capped 8 acres of the landfill trenches, and drilled 14 pumping wells to clean ground water around the site. In 1997, Waste Management of Maryland (purchaser of F.P.R Bohager and Sons), The Beatrice Company (purchaser of Farboil Co), and Lucent Technologies paid $2.85 million toward cleanup of the site without admitting liability. Altogether, the Carrs Mill Landfill has been cited with seven EPA Clean Water Act Violations. The landfill site has been renamed to Carrs Mill Park, although no amenities exist onsite and few indications are given to the public about its former use, See also *Landfills in the United States *Environment of the United States *Waste in the United States References External links Category:Landfills in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Howard County, Maryland Category:Environment of Maryland Category:1953 establishments in Maryland Category:1977 disestablishments in Maryland ","title":"Carr's Mill Landfill"},{"id":"43114977","text":"The Model Town operation, more commonly known as the Model Town tragedy or the Lahore massacre (), or simply Lahore incident, was a violent clash that ensued between the Punjab Police and Pakistan Awami Tehreek activists on 17 June 2014 resulting in several protesters being killed by the police gunfire. Five police officers remain under arrest. The standoff lasted for almost 11 hours when the police's anti-encroachment squad launched an operation to remove the barriers from the road leading to the offices of Minhaj-ul-Quran and the residence of PAT founder Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri in Model Town, Lahore, even though police officials were given a court order by PAT leaders, stating \\"due to terrorism issue place security barriers in front of Minhaj-ul-Quran and the residence of PAT founder Dr.Qadri. The incident was broadcast live on various local news channels and there were conflicting accounts of how the standoff began. Police claimed that they were attacked by people inside the PAT secretariat, a claim that is denied by party chief Qadri. In the live footage broadcast on television, the policemen were shown firing assault rifles and lobbing tear gas canisters at the protesting masses while the protesters threw stones at the police. Qadri strongly condemned the attack and called it the worst form of state terrorism. Qadri vowed to avenge the deaths of his political workers by bringing about a revolution that would hasten the end of the rule of prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz Sharif. Following the incident, Qadri‚Ä≤s importance grew in Pakistani politics where he had \\"otherwise been regarded by most observers as posing little threat to the government\\". Where some analysts considered Qadri a \\"political non-entity\\" before the incident, others expressed concern that the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) government reacted \\"disproportionately and aggressively\\" in this matter, \\"shooting itself in the foot\\" and feeling \\"'insecure' with the attention that Qadri [had] managed to attract\\". Background On 16 June 2014, the Pakistan Awami Tehreek founder and chief Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri warned the government of \\"serious consequences\\" if anything was to happen to him on his return to Pakistan on 23 June 2014. For some time, Qadri had been amassing the support of political parties in the opposition to form a grand alliance against the incumbent Nawaz Sharif administration. Qadri had successfully rallied for and acquired the support of political stalwarts like Pakistan Muslim League (Q) president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rasheed in forming a \\"grand alliance\\" against the government. The incident At around 1am PKT on 17 June 2014, the Punjab Police launched an anti-encroachment operation to remove barriers outside the offices of Minhaj-ul-Quran International and Qadri's residence in the Model Town suburb in Lahore. The police reached the PAT headquarters in a large contingent and demanded the party workers to remove the barricades which they claimed were illegal. The raid was untimely in contrast to the routine morning raids the police often conducts in similar cases. The PAT workers insisted that the barricades were legal and that they had been set up four years ago to protect Qadri's home and office when he issued a decree against the Taliban. Nevertheless, the police carried on with their operation to demolish the Jersey barriers with bulldozers prompting the PAT workers and activists to resist the police efforts by starting a protest against the police action. =London Plan= There are serious concerns of civil society of Pakistan that the whole plot was designed by some ex- government officials http://www.thenewstribe.com/2015/04/06/ex-army-officers-were-behind-sit-ins- script-javed-hashmi/ though Dr. Qadri and his party denied these charges. The liberal political parties also insisted that the whole event was drafted in London sometimes referred as London Plan.http://www.theasians.co.uk/story/20140924_nawaz_us_un =Live media coverage= After the initial protests, the police retreated for a while, only to return in greater numbers at 5 am. In the meantime, PAT workers had also managed to amass a crowd of supporters and called in the local media. The protesters started pelting the police squad with stones to protest against the removal of barriers. The violent resistance from the protesters led the police to retreat once again. Throughout the ensuing clash, reporters and journalists managed to cover the scenes in live broadcasts aired across various national news channels for the rest of the night and the following day. =Negotiations with PAT= Upon gauging the violent reaction from the protesting crowds, DCO Muhammad Usman and DIG Operations Rana Jabbar negotiated with PAT general- secretary Khurram Nawaz Gandapur and chief security officer (CSO) Altaf Shah. Shah was adamant that he and his party workers would not let the police remove the barriers. According to the Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Chaudhry Shafique Ahmad, there were two rounds of negotiations between the party officials and the police where the party workers were asked to remove the hurdles on their own. When the negotiations failed to bring fruit, the police returned for a third time with a 100-strong squad at 9:30 am to forcefully remove the barriers. They were met with fierce retaliation yet again as the protesters pelted the police. =Violent measures= The police returned for a fourth time at 11:20 am. This time, the force was led in groups commanded by seven-to-eight SPs where some put focus on firing directly into the crowd while others used various tactics to disperse the crowds, like firing tear gas and charging with batons. With the police firing weapons directly into the crowd of protesters, 8 protesters (including 2 women one of whom was pregnant) died at the scene while around 80 protesters were gravely injured. =Anarchy= Amidst all the chaos and police brutality, media cameras were able to capture an unknown vandal smashing cars. It was later identified that the \\"handlebar-mustached vandal\\", Gullu Butt was a known police tout and had been a known activist of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), the party in government. Butt brandished a club he used to smash cars and was also heard chanting slogans. In one footage, Butt was also seen leading the law enforcement officers' charge against the protesters. Soon afterwards, Model Town SP Tariq Aziz was seen chatting and hugging Butt. Later in an editorial written for the Daily Times, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf information secretary Andleeb Abbas called Butt a \\"henchman\\" of the PML-N government and accused the state police as having \\"aided, abetted and applauded [the vandal] with absolutely no inhibition for the atrocious crimes that he was committing\\". =Police claims= The police claimed that the Minhaj-ul-Quran administration had deployed a private militia that was manning the barriers and had effectively converted the residential area into a no-go area. Qadri later said that the number of arrests was understated by the police as more than 200 of his party workers were missing and unaccounted for. On the complaint of a sub- inspector, the Faisal Town Police later registered a case against more than 3000 PAT workers under sections 7ATA, 302, 324, 353, 148/149 of the Pakistan Penal Code. The police FIR also formally nominated Hussain Mohiuddin, the son of the PAT chief Qadri, as the main accused. Formal inquisition Immediately following the incident, the Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif ordered a judicial inquiry into the events that unfolded on the day. He said he was \\"saddened over the killings\\" and would not hesitate to resign if held responsible for the negligence. He assured that he had already constituted a judicial commission to probe the incident. Sharif denied any knowledge of the police operation and claimed complete ignorance of the bloodshed. His opponents ridiculed him for not knowing about the incident despite the live broadcast that covered the \\"bloody episode that continued for hours\\". Upon watching the TV footage, Sharif ordered for the immediate arrest of the notorious vandal Gullu Butt. Sharif also asked the federal minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal was to brief the house on the Lahore killings. =Tampering evidence= On 19 June 2014, it was reported that several police officials went to a hospital where the wounded were being treated and altered the medico-legal certificates of injured police officials to show \\"fake bullet injuries\\" in order to justify their claim that PAT workers also shot at the police. Qadri accused the provincial government of tampering with the evidence in the hospital records and denied that his party workers had any arms at all. He also asked the police to produce the confiscated weapons before the media in order to prove their claim. =Qadri rejects judicial commission= The PAT chief Qadri said that the reason for the police action was to \\"threaten him and his party\\" before his arrival in Pakistan on 23 June 2014. He openly rejected the judicial commission and said that the judicial commission could not independently conduct an impartial investigation as long as the PML-N is in government. He expressed concerns that the police may use bribery and scare tactics to coerce false eyewitness accounts in their favour. Later, while addressing a press conference on 21 June 2014 via video-link from Canada, Qadri urged for an investigation team comprising representatives of the ISI, MI and IB, and a judicial commission of three supreme court judges to probe the incident. =Rana Sanaullah justifies police action= In justifying the police operation, the Punjab law minister Rana Sanaullah Khan told the press that \\"for a person who consistently defies the constitution and the democratic system, Tahir-ul-Qadri had been trying to bulldoze the Pakistani democracy by spreading anarchy\\". He blamed the religious leader of inciting hatred by asking innocent civilians to take oaths on the Quran to amass against the government. Tahir-ul-Qadri later vehemently denied such claims and called this justification for the operation as being preposterous. Rana Sanaullah also justified the operation by claiming that the police were able to identify several armed men and weapons at the Minhaj-ul- Quran offices, a claim refuted by several PAT officials. After the operation ended, no police official was immediately held responsible for mishandling and criminal negligence. =Ministers removed from posts= In a press conference at the PML-N Central Secretariat in Lahore on 21 June 2014, Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif said that he had decided to remove the Punjab Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs Rana Sanaullah Khan (who has been restored by Punjab Government on May 29, 2015) and Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister Dr Toqueer Shah from their posts to ensure fair and transparent investigation into the incident. Reaction of the Opposition parties Following the incident, major parties in opposition including the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Muslim League (Q; PML-Q) boycotted the Punjab Assembly in protest. The Human Rights Watch strongly condemned the 'lethal force' by the Police and demanded full investigation. ‚ÄúThe Pakistani authorities need to explain why police officers found it necessary to fire live ammunition directly into a crowd of protesters throwing rocks,‚Äù said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of dead and wounded people in Lahore today, and no clear reason why.‚Äù Human Rights Watch (Pakistan: Fully Investigate Deadly Shootings) https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/06/17/pakistan-fully-investigate-deadly- shootings The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has strongly condemned the police action at the Tahirul Qadri Secretariat.HRCP condemns police brutality, loss of life in Lahore action http://hrcp- web.org/hrcpweb/hrcp-condemns-police-brutality-loss-of-life-in-lahore-action/ * Pakistan Peoples Party condemned the attack. The opposition leader Syed Khursheed Shah said that the events were a \\"conspiracy against democracy allegedly hatched by Shahbaz Sharif\\". He condemned the use of force against Tahir-ul-Qadri's supporters. * Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf also condemned the attack and the party's central president Javed Hashmi asked the government to stop the killings of innocent people immediately. PTI's Punjab president Ejaz Chaudhry demanded an apology from prime minister Nawaz Sharif and the chief minister Shahbaz Sharif while stating that the \\"government was responsible for [the] incident\\" and that \\"there was no justification for such an incident\\". * Muttahida Qaumi Movement condemned the police action and announced a day of mourning for the victims. Party leader Farooq Sattar called the police operation \\"undemocratic and barbaric\\". MQM's deputy convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqi stated that \\"the protest of the PAT workers was peaceful\\". An all parties conference (APC) of political and religious parties except PMLN, PPP, and Awami National Party (ANP) called by PAT head Dr Qadri on 29 June 2014, condemned the killings and demanded an investigation by Supreme Court's three- member bench. The APC reiterated the demand for Chief Minister's resignation and arrest of the Punjab's to top police officers. The PMLN's central and provincial governments responded to the demands that the investigations are already underway. The federal information minister, Pervez Rasheed, maintained that the parties participating in the APC are trying to \\"keep their politics alive\\" as they have no representation in the parliament.

He was the author of several books about the Civil rights movement. Early life Graham was born on September 2, 1936 in Little Rock, Arkansas, one of three sons of a Presbyterian minister. He studied history at Yale University and completed a Ph.D. in history at Stanford University in 1964. Career From 1967 to 1971 he taught at Johns Hopkins University, where he served as director of the Institute of Southern History. In 1968‚Äì69 he co-directed a task force for the Kerner Commission on civil disorders and co-edited the commission's report, Violence in America. He taught for 20 years at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, before moving in 1991 to Vanderbilt University, where he was Holland N. McTyeire Professor of History, dean of the social science division, and later dean of graduate studies and research. He later became an adjunct professor of History at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Graham's early interest in civil rights and southern politics led him to join Numan Bartley in 1975 in writing Southern Politics and the Second Reconstruction, an update of the classic work by V.O. Key. While teaching at the University of Maryland, he began a new line of scholarship involving the making and implementation of federal policy. These studies led to three major books and a national reputation as the most successful pioneer in the new field of policy history. His first policy study, The Uncertain Triumph (1984), dealt with the enactment and implementation of major federal aid for public education. Next came his most influential book, The Civil Rights Era (1990), which dealt with the enactment and implementation of the three major civil rights acts. His last policy study, which complemented his work on civil rights, was Collision Course (2002). It showed how early civil rights legislation, intended largely to correct injustices to African Americans, eventually offered protections to immigrant minorities who were among Americans with the highest incomes, revealing \\"the often unforeseen, or unwanted, effects of social legislation\\".

Established in 1917, the newspaper soon became the official voice of the Communist Party of Lithuania. After the Lithuanian victory in the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War, the party and the newspaper were outlawed in Lithuania. Therefore, it was first printed in exile and later illegally in Kaunas. Tiesa survived irregular publishing schedules, frequent relocations, staff changes, and other difficulties and, after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940, became the official daily of the new communist regime. At its peak, its circulation exceeded 300,000 copies. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tiesa lost its official status and its circulation shrunk. The publication was discontinued in 1994. History =Early history= The first issue of Tiesa was published by the Lithuanian section of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks) in Petrograd on April 12, 1917. In October 1917, Tiesa became the official newspaper of the Lithuanian section. From April to December 1918, it was published in Moscow. By December 12, 1918, 91 issues of Tiesa were published. In March‚ÄìApril 1919, five issues of the newspaper were published in Vilnius, the proclaimed capital of the short-lived Lithuanian‚ÄìBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was the official newspaper of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Lithuania and Belorussia. When Poland captured Vilnius during the Vilna offensive, Tiesa evacuated and was printed with interruptions in Raseiniai, Kaunas, K√∂nigsberg, Bellshill, Smolensk as the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Lithuania. In March 1926, it settled more permanently in Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. The communist party was outlawed in Lithuania, therefore Tiesa had to be printed illegally. There were 157 issues published in Kaunas. =Lithuanian SSR= After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940, Tiesa was legalized and became a daily. It appeared first as Liaudies balsas (June 16‚Äì25) but soon recovered its historical name. It continued to be the official outlet of the Communist Party of Lithuania until the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The newspaper was reestablished in Moscow in February 1942. There, 85 issues were published until July 1944. In August 1944, after the Soviet victory in Vilnius Offensive, the newspaper relocated to Vilnius. Once again, it became a daily. From August 1945, in addition to being the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Lithuania, Tiesa was also the official voice of the communist government, specifically the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR and the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian SSR.

Kelly was excommunicated from the LDS Church in 2014. She is also a nationally-known advocate for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Early life and education Kelly was born in Arizona to Jim and Donna Kelly and is one of five siblings. She grew up in Hood River, Oregon. Her mother is an attorney and her father a retired newspaper publisher and university administrator. Both parents were converts to the LDS Church, and her father at one time served as bishop of a local congregation. Kelly graduated from Brigham Young University (BYU) with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 2006. While at BYU, she organized a campus free speech protest of nearly 100 students concerning the firing of a university employee for criticizing student elections. While at BYU, and for a time after she graduated, Kelly wrote for \\"The Mormon Worker,\\" a Mormon left-leaning publication modeled after the Catholic Worker founded by Dorothy Day. In 2010 Kelly founded \\"Mormon May Day\\" as a day for liberal or radical Mormons to hold a collective fast and make their voices heard within Mormonism on progressive themes. Kelly went on to earn a J.D. degree from American University Washington College of Law, a law school founded by two suffragists in 1898, and graduated cum laude in 2012. During Kelly's legal career she has worked for several human rights organizations including the Center for Constitutional Rights; the Inter- American Court of Human Rights; the United Nations Committee Against Torture in Geneva, Switzerland; Women's Refugee Commission; RFK Center for Justice & Human Rights; Legal Action Worldwide in Nairobi, Kenya; the United Nations High Commission on Refugees; Planned Parenthood; Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute; Equality Now, and is the host of the podcast Ordinary Equalityfrom Wonder Media Network. Activism =Ordain Women= In May 2013, Kelly founded Ordain Women, an organization advocating for the ordination of women to the priesthood in the LDS Church. Local church leaders requested Kelly to cease her campaign. Kelly subsequently demonstrated on Temple Square during the church's April 2014 General Conference, after which she was excommunicated in June 2014 in absentia after declining to attend a disciplinary council. She instead submitted a written defense through her representative Nadine Hansen, a fellow Mormon feminist attorney, and hundreds of letters on her behalf from supporters. In the weeks before and after her excommunication, Kelly urged followers to stay in the church and \\"raise hell\\" if they could do so while maintaining their mental and emotional health. Kelly appealed her excommunication, first to her stake president, then to the church's First Presidency, all of whom rejected the appeal. Kelly often states that ‚Äúequality is not a feeling,‚Äù meaning gender equality is something that can be measured and does not depend on the individual feelings of worthiness or individual women feeling valued by their community. =Women's Rights= In January 2017, Kelly helped plan the Utah contingent of the Women's March on Washington and helped organize several hundred women to attend the march in Washington D.C. The following Monday she organized and emceed one of the largest marches in Utah's history on the State Capitol in Salt Lake City. At that rally, Kelly said, ‚ÄúI'm sick and tired of men making laws about our bodies and our choices and our lives without consulting us.‚Äù While at Columbia University‚Äôs Human Rights Institute, Kelly provided training and technical assistance to local governments engaged in implementing issues from the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In May 2019, Kelly helped facilitate workshops in Uruguay and Argentina for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Dr. Ahmed Shaheed. Kelly then participated in workshops put on by the Rapporteurship in Geneva in September 2019 and New York in October, situations where the human rights of women and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity minorities clash with the right to freedom of religion or belief. The workshops culminated in a report which was presented to the Human Rights Council in early 2020. Kelly has long spoken out about sexual harassment and assault against women. In January 2020, with a group of other women and activists, she performed the viral anti-rape protest anthem \\"Un Violador en Tu Camino\\" (The Rapist in Your Path) outside the Harvey Weinstein trial in New York City. Kelly said of the action, ‚Äúpointing the finger of blame for sexual assault at the appropriate target ... was a cathartic experience, to feel our collective feminist power as a force for good.\\" =Equal Rights Amendment= In August 2012, the same year she graduated law school, Kelly attended her first rally for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) on the front law of the U.S. Capitol. Kelly then helped revive the group Mormons for ERA, originally founded by excommunicated Mormon feminist Sonia Johnson. In 2017, after the women‚Äôs marches worldwide turned attention to women‚Äôs rights, Kelly helped draft an ERA ratification resolution in Utah (one of 15 unratified states at the time) and helped recruit state senator Jim Dabakis to sponsor the resolution. The ERA has not been ratified in Utah and is opposed by the LDS Church, but Kelly continues to advocate for ratification there. Kelly said in Truthout that more interest in the ERA exists today because, \\"I think that women are realizing that nothing that we have is permanent. Nothing is too sacred to be rolled back, and things that we have taken for granted in the past are now up for grabs.\\" She is featured in the MSNBC documentary \\"This Happened: On Account of Sex\\" on the ERA and attended the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties first official hearing on the ERA in almost 40 years on April 30, 2019. For the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, Kelly wrote a piece for ReWire News connecting votes for women to the continued campaign to ratify the ERA saying, \\"Today, two fights are left unwon‚Äîuniversal suffrage and ratification of the ERA.\\" In December 2019, Kelly led a group of ERA activists in a demonstration on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. The group sang new-twists on Christmas carols with lyrics about equality outside the Salt Lake Temple and then proceeded to project an \\"ERA YES\\" symbol, which was over three stories tall, on the LDS Church's Conference Center. In January 2020, Kelly launched a podcast called Ordinary Equality on the past, present and future of the ERA, taking the title of the podcast from a quote by Alice Paul, the author of the ERA in 1923, who said of the amendment: \\"Most reforms, most problems are complicated. But to me there is nothing complicated about ordinary equality.\\" Ordinary Equality has been recommended by the Today Show and Marie Claire as well as featured on shows such as WNYC's All Of It with Alison Stewart. Kelly has written about how the ERA will cover transgender people and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. She also co- wrote a piece with Virginia delegate Danica Roem, the first out-and-seated transgender state legislator in U.S. history, called \\"The Equal Rights Amendment Can‚Äôt Be Defeated by Anti-Trans Scare Tactics\\" about the role transgender women are playing to get the amendment ratified. Kelly wrote in The Advocate in August of 2020 that the LGTBQIA community needs to be more vocal in its support of the ERA, \\"to get the protection and recognition that well over 50 percent of the population deserves ‚Äî for women, girls, nonbinary folx, our transgender siblings, and all marginalized genders and sexual orientations.\\" Because of her zeal for the ERA, Kelly was featured in a 2020 Glamour Magazine piece where she said her excommunication \\"was a gift because it set me free to work on other causes and things I am passionate about and places that actually need me and value my work\\" and that \\"that freedom of religion includes freedom from religion.\\" On June 29, 2020, Kelly was co- counsel on an amicus brief filed on behalf of the ERA youth activism organization GenERAtion Ratify in the case Commonwealth of Virginia v. David S. Ferriero. The amicus brief argues in support of \\"the plaintiff states‚Äô effort to resolve the century-long movement to guarantee gender equality in the Constitution, we urge the court to not view the Equal Rights Amendment as only our grandmother‚Äôs fight. Rather, we urge the court also to recognize its importance to young and diverse advocates of this generation that the Amendment be added to the Constitution. Young advocates have led the movement to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment since its inception. Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment recognize the expressive function it serves and the important message it will send to young people: that gender equality is among our nation‚Äôs highest values... Both as an expression of our country‚Äôs values and as a means for change, the Amendment has the potential to further young Americans‚Äô interests in a broader guarantee of gender equality in all aspects of American life.‚Äù Personal life Kelly served an 18-month LDS mission in Barcelona, Spain, and as a result is a fluent Spanish speaker. She has also lived and worked in San Jose, Costa Rica and San Cristobal de Las Casas in Chiapas, Mexico. Kelly married J. Neil Ransom in the Salt Lake Temple in 2006. The couple were \\"childless by choice\\". On March 14, 2016, Kelly confirmed she and her husband had divorced. On April 15, 2019, Kelly came out as queer on Twitter. She is dating Catholic writer and theologian, Jamie Manson, who she initially met at a women's ordination conference in 2015. In January 2020 she was quoted for the first time in the media and identified as queer: \\"'As a queer woman, I cannot tell you how elated I am to finally see myself reflected in our nation‚Äôs most foundational document,' added Kelly.\\" In October 2015, she participated in the ordination of a female Roman Catholic priest coordinated by the Association of Roman Catholic Women Priests, an organization claiming affiliation with the Catholic Church. Ordination of women to the Catholic priesthood goes against canon law and any known participants are automatically excommunicated. Kelly no longer claims religious affiliation with any particular denomination, and in 2018 she founded her own feminist/womanist interreligious and inclusive celebration of women and nonbinary people of all faith traditions called Sacred Space, with Yale Divinity professor and Baptist preacher Eboni Marshall-Turman and trans Jewish activist Abby Stein.

The song recalls the future the newly married couple made for their future and their future family, as well as the stories of the girl's relationship with her father. Later, her father falls ill and, in his last days, recalls many fond memories with his family as they keep a bedside vigil. After he dies, the woman remarks how at peace her father appeared to be lying in the bed he (literally) made. In the final verse, the woman (now an adult) is about to take her wedding vows and ask her husband to uphold the same values of fidelity and trust her parents did, before spending their first night together in the same four-poster bed her father built years ago.

The district encompasses most of Taylorville's downtown business center; while it is primarily commercial, it also includes several important government buildings. The Christian County Courthouse, a Romanesque building constructed in 1902, forms the centerpiece of the district. While development in the district began in the late 1830s, only two buildings in the district predate 1875. The first major growth period represented in the district occurred from 1875 to 1900; the commercial buildings from this period feature Italianate, Romanesque, Beaux-Arts, and Queen Anne designs. Another period of construction followed the courthouse's opening; in the ensuing decades, several Classical Revival and Prairie School buildings opened, as did the Mission Revival public library. Since 1935, the district has remained largely intact. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1985.

In 2020 the project's agreement was finalised later it was formally signed in a ceremony attended by the Pakistani Prime Minister, and Chinese ambassador. https://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/551382-Govt-signs-tripartite-agreement- for-1124-MW-Kohala-Hydro-Power-Project- Location  The diversion dam site is on Jhelum River near Sarran Village 40 km upstream from Muzaffarabad and a 20 km long tunnel connects to the powerhouse which is located at Barsala 7 km upstream from Kohala Bridge. Background China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC), the state-owned hydropower developer, won the right to develop a hydroelectric dam in Pakistan on January 7, 2015. The Kohala Hydropower Project will be CTGC's largest investment in Pakistan. In December 2018 the people of Muzaffarabad held protests against Kohala dam design due to its planned water diversion via tunnel which will bypass the Muzaffarabad city. Design The dam's feasibility study and detailed engineering designs were performed by SMEC. The Kohala hydroelectric scheme will have a gravity, roller-concrete compacted dam on the upper branch of the Jhelum, 40 km from Muzaffarabad. The powerhouse, on the lower branch of the Jhelum near Barasala, will house four 281-MW Pelton turbines. Tariffs CWE is required to construct the project on a build, own, operate and transfer basis. In 2014, local published reports said the average tariff for the first 12 years was set at 8.9 cents per unit and during the following 18 years would be 5.1 cents per unit. The average tariff for the 30-year life of the project is 7.9 cents per unit. The tariff ensures 17 per cent return on equity on internal rate of return basis. Carbon credit The project is expected to earn carbon credit from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for clean energy development under the Kyoto protocol.

It is based on a Marathi novel Andharachya Parambya by Jaywant Dalvi, on which he also wrote the play Barrister. The film set in small rural town in Maharashtra in early 19th century, and deals with clash of progressives and orthodox traditions, while depicting plight of women especially widows in traditional Indian society under feudalism and oppressive patriarchy. The film starred Anupam Kher, Vijaya Mehta, Nilu Phule, and Tanvi Azmi. At the 33rd National Film Awards for 1985 films, the film won two awards; Best Supporting Actress for Vijaya Mehta, while Sham Bhutkar won the award for Best Art Direction. Synopsis A young barrister, Rao Saheb, returns from England after his education, and brings progressive ideas back with him. In other words, he is enamored of western ways and customs and conditioned to regard his own society as backward and repressive. He returns to his childhood home, a large mansion in small-town Maharashtra, where life goes on as placidly as it always has, quite unmoved by western ways or the officious efforts of modernists to bring about a social revolution. Rao Saheb's father is a conventional man who holds dear the values of his Brahmin caste: education, religion, tradition, austerity (frugality) and self-denial in personal life. His great tryst with modernity was to send his son, at very great expense, to England for higher education. His sister, who keeps house for him, is a childless widow of even greater orthodoxy. Mausi (\\"auntie\\"), played by Vijaya Mehta herself, is the vanguard of Brahminism at the start of the film. Radhika, a young widow who lives in a neighbouring home, is a great friend and prot√©g√©e of the elderly widow. In Radhika, auntie sees the picture of her own lonely youth as a young widow, and the prospect of a lonely old age. Radhika however is inclined to rebel against the customs of austerity and self-denial which were expected of Brahmin widows at the time. Auntie, she of the unshakable orthodoxy, is torn within herself when she finds that her nephew is growing alarmingly close to the nubile young widow. As Rao Saheb begins to get closer to Radhika, empathizes with her and comes close to her, Mausi ends up as a champion of modernity and a denouncer of Brahminical values such as austerity, self-denial and the strictures of religion or tradition.

Erlistoun was known as a district in the area before the station was established. The lease was first taken up by Butcher and Uhr in 1904, originally on a block extending northward from Laverton for a distance of with a width of . The company was initially running cattle at Erlistoun, 1,000 head of which they had overlanded down from the Kimberley. The Emanuel brothers owned the property in 1911 when it was sold to Kalgoorlie-Boulder Firewood Company. At this time the property occupied an area of and was still running cattle. In 1924 the property was estimated to be carrying 5,500 head of cattle. By 1925 the size of the property was estimated as being and was stocked with 4,000 head of cattle. Sheep had been introduced to the property by this time and in 1926 it was stocked with 7,000 cattle and 5,000 sheep. Shearing the same year yielded 31 bales of wool per 1,000 sheep. Another 4,000 sheep were due to arrive at the station in late 1926. Erlistoun was the initial location of the first feature-length film shot in Western Australia; scenes for the film Down Under, directed by Harry Southwell, were shot at the station in 1926. The area received heavy rains in 1929 with Erlistoun recording over in 24 hours and over in total for the month. The normally dry creek ran for a length of over through the property. In 1930, the property was running a flock of 13,000 sheep. In the same year the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Firewood company changed its name to the Erlistoun Pastoral Company; the directors were Alex Porter, J. McCalmont and E.H. Jolly. In 2003 the property was being plagued by wild dogs attacking the sheep. Other properties in the area were similarly affected. The area is popular amongst gold prospectors.
