The following year King George offered a pardon to all pirates who surrendered within a year. Winter kept active, capturing a merchant ship near Jamaica and forcing one of its crewmen, Edward England, into piracy. England embraced piracy and Winter returned with him to New Providence.

History  Developed by Olivier \\"Radek\\" Dabrowski in the mid-2010s, the Radek Maneuver was originally conceived of in using and maintaining applications running on a PaaS system.  Execution  The Radek Maneuver consists of a series of steps, usually executed via the PaaS or web portal interface. The tactic should be used when a service is misbehaving or otherwise experiencing errors, and the suspected cause is the underlying cloud layer, rather than the application layer. This includes networking issues and other \\"bad box\\" problems. The steps are as follows: # Identify the application or service which is misbehaving. # Increase the compute resource (number of CPU cores, amount of ram) for the instance on which the application is running. This is also known as scaling up. # Wait for the application to re- deploy and stabilize. # Scale back down to the original instance size.  Principle of action  This scale-up-scale-down method is understood to shift the application to a different physical machine underlying the PaaS service or application virtual machine. While this layer of the cloud computing stack is generally out of the access of an application developer (instead in the hands of the cloud provider), the maneuver allows troubleshooting and dodging errors in that layer.

He was an amazing athlete in football, basketball, and baseball and was a member of Medusa, the senior honor society. Military career Edward Donald Walsh had a distinguished military career. He was a senior at Trinity College when the National Guard unit of which he was a member was ordered to active duty. Walsh went with the 43rd division to the South Pacific as a Second Lieutenant. He served with the 102 Infantry at several stations in the South Pacific until his unit was attached to the Marine 3rd Amphibian Corp for the Okinawa invasion, one of the bloodiest battles of the whole Pacific operation. He was promoted to Captain and after the Japanese surrendered, he took his unit to occupation duty in Korea. In 1950 another active duty came; Walsh commanded the Second Battalion of the 102nd Infantry in this country and in Germany. He was promoted to United States Property and Fiscal Officer for Connecticut, a responsible, full-time Federal appointment, and remained in that position until he was appointed Connecticut Adjutant General by Governor Dempsey from 1963 to 1972. While in charge, the Connecticut National Guard soared to an outstanding efficient rating, because of his tough, but fair approach. He was able to bring the Connecticut National Guard and its personal to heights never seen before. Decorations include American Defense Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign with two battle stars, American Campaign Medal, Army of Occupation Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Army Reserve Medal, State of Connecticut Long Service Medal, National Defense Medal, and Korean Emergency Medal.

Malaysia has had a national animal welfare law since 1953, though it was criticized for being weak and under- enforced. In 2015, Malaysia passed an updated animal welfare law strengthening protections for animals and penalties for animal cruelty. Animal protection efforts in Malaysia appear to be exclusively welfare-driven rather than rights-driven.  Legislation  = Provisions = Malaysia's Animals Act of 1953 (AA) is the country's major piece of animal welfare legislation. Under the AA, a person commits an offense of animal cruelty if they ‚Äúcruelly beats, kicks, ill-treats, overrides, overdrives, overloads, tortures, infuriates or terrifies any animal.\\" Specific offenses include failing to supply sufficient food or water to an animal in confinement or transport; confining an animal in a way that causes unnecessary suffering; fighting or baiting animals; using an unfit animal for work or labor; and killing, poising, maiming, or rendering useless an animal. There are exceptions for killing livestock for food, as well as hunting, in which the use of painful traps is not expressly prohibited. The Malaysian Penal Code distinguishes between animals worth at least RM5, and those worth at least RM25; penalties for cruelty against the latter group are heavier, indicating the protection of animals as property as one of the goals of Malaysian anti-cruelty statutes. In 2015, following calls from animal protectionists for stronger animal welfare legislation, Malaysia passed a new Animal Welfare Act (AWA). The AWA establishes an animal welfare board to the monitor work of animal protection associations; requires licenses for all individuals and businesses that use animals; prohibits breeding animals for research or teaching; bans the shooting of stray dogs; and grants courts the power to disqualify or deprive any owner or licensee from owning an animal indefinitely. The AWA also increases the penalty for cruelty from the AA's maximum of a RM200 fine and/or up to 6 months imprisonment, to a fine between RM20,000 and RM100,000 and/or up to 3 years in prison. In 2014 (before the passage of the AWA), Malaysia received a C out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index. It was again given a C grade in their 2020 rankings. = Enforcement = Penalties for cruelty towards animals have historically been very mild. *In 2005, when a dog suffered such neglect that it had to be euthanized, its owner was fined RM100. *In 2011, a woman who tortured and stomped kittens to death was fined RM400. *In 2012, a person who poured boiling water on a stray dog was fined RM200. *In another 2012 incident, the owners of a cat hotel left 150 cats unattended long enough that they suffered severe starvation and dehydration. They were charged RM6000 for 30 counts of cruelty and neglect and given 3 months in prison. This was the first time an animal cruelty case had reached the Malaysian High Court and the first time a sentence of more than a few days in prison had been given for an animal cruelty conviction. *In 2013, a woman was sentenced to one year in prison for killing her employer's dog. According to SEE (2013), \\"These cases more or less sum up the history of animal cruelty prosecution in Malaysia.\\" There were also an additional four animal cruelty prosecutions between 2006 and 2010.  Animals used for food  Malaysian meat consumption is rising steadily. Between 1981 and 2015, consumption of cow rose from 23,000 metric tons to 250,000. Between 1996 and 2015, consumption of poultry rose from 666,000 metric tons to 1.59 million. Ruminant, poultry meat, and egg production have risen rapidly in recent years (though pork production has fallen). However, animal product production is not growing fast enough to meet the increasing demand, and the government has implemented strategies to expand the livestock industry.  Organizations  Malaysian animal welfare organizations include the Sarawak Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (formed 1959), the Selangor Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (formed 1958), and the Malaysian National Animal Welfare Foundation (formed 1998). These organizations do not appear to oppose human use of animals, but work to ensure their humane treatment, focusing largely on the welfare of pets and strays. There do not appear any groups which consider themselves animal rights organizations in Malaysia.

No New Jail in San Francisco. N.p. Web.http://criticalresistance.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/05/SFJF-CR_PeoplesReport_WEB.pdf The group worked closely with the organization Critical Resistance to see their plans come into action. The proposal by San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi was to construct a new $290 million jail in SF. The No New SF Jail Coalition fought against this proposal advocating that the current system was only at 65% capacity, population in SF jails was decreasing, and that prisoners were reporting abuse by the sheriff's deputies. The key goals of the Coalition were to prevent the expansion of jails in San Francisco, as the construction of a new jail would do nothing to combat the real issue of mass incarceration. The campaign began in 2013 and after two years of work in December 2015, the Coalition was victorious in its efforts. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted against allocating the money towards the project. Board President London Breed advocated for the cause, believing that instead of building new jails the city needs to focus on putting money towards programs that address mental health and addiction. As a result, the Coalition was successful in its organizing and advocacy towards prison and jail abolition.  History and background  The history behind jail and prison abolition lies in the work of others such as William G. Nagel, Stephen Joseph Perrello, Julia Sudbury, and Rosemary Gido. In correlation with the No New SF Jail Coalition, key themes and issues identified in the work against prison abolition include: the decreasing jail population, mistreatment of prisoners, and the need for prison reform instead of more facilities. = Jail population = In Rosemary Gido's \\"Trends in Jail Admission Rates\\" it is shown that \\"crowding continues to be the major issue confronting local jails across the country\\".Gido, Rosemary L. \\"TRENDS IN JAIL ADMISSIONS RATES.\\" American Journal of Criminal Justice 14.1 (1989): 1. Print. While there have been groups such as the American Prison Association who have \\"advocated the establishment of institutions to care for misdemeanants, apart from the crowded jails, only a handful of states established farms for this purpose\\". For many, the increase of prisoners is the primary reason for an increase in jails, but for the No New SF Jail Coalition, they argue that the jail population is decreasing in San Francisco and therefore a new jail is not needed. = Prisoner treatment = The mistreatment of prisoners is another theme for the No New SF Jail Coalition's fight against a new jail. They believe that a new jail would only encourage more abuse at the hands of the deputies working at the jails. Alexander M. Capron's article \\"Medical Research in Prisons\\" analyzes prisoners who are used as subjects in medical research, and calls into question whether these prisoners actually volunteer for these experiments or if they are coerced into volunteering. Capron questions the morality of the prison system and the value of prisoners. Despite being people who have committed crimes, Capron calls attention to the fact that these are still people, and questions if putting their lives in jeopardy for the sake of research is truly the price they need to pay for their crimes.Capron, Alexander M. \\"Medical Research in Prisons.\\" The Hastings Center Report 3.3 (1973): 4‚Äì6. Web. The No New SF Jail Coalition also aims for the humane treatment of prisoners, as they believe that instead of jails, prisoners are in need of alternative programs. = Alternative and reform programs = Another theme is the call for less prisons and jails and more programs to promote reform among prisoners that would assist to improve their mental and emotional health. William G. Nagel's articles \\"A Moratorium On Correctional Construction\\" and \\"A Statement on Behalf of a Moratorium on Prison Construction\\" suggest alternatives to jails and prisons. He believes \\"the immediate thing to do is call a halt to the building of new prisons, jails, and training school at least for a time, while we plan and develop alternatives\\".Nagel, William G.\\"A Statement on Behalf of a Moratorium on Prison Construction.\\" Prison Journal 56.2 (1976): 32. Print Nagel's past as a deputy gives him insight into the issues that building a new jail would bring as he has witnessed prisoners adapt to the situations in which they are placed. As a result, Nagel \\"found the inmate community to be distinctly antisocial and it worked against the goals of the larger society and thereby against rehabilitation efforts\\" therefore, \\"the behavior of the convicts is determined by the convicts themselves\\".Nagel, William G. \\"A Moratorium On Correctional Construction.\\" Prison Journal 52.2 (1972): 66‚Äì72. Web. Due to Nagel's belief that reform efforts do not work, he advocates for alternatives to the prison. Although his solutions are not explicitly stated, he believes that the prison system should be \\"repudiated and abandoned\\" instead of creating more prisons and jails. Nagel's beliefs are also echoed by other writers. Russ Immarigeon, who wrote, \\"The Context of Jail Litigation in the United States\\" shares the same sentiment as Nagel, but also focuses on how people can \\"develop strategies for more systematic use of alternatives to confinement, establish training in non-violent conflict resolution, and other useful projects at their jails, and bring together community support for these changes\\"Immarigeon, Russ. \\"The Context of Jail Litigation in the United States.\\" Prison Journal 70.2 (1990): 12. Print. which also focuses on the desire for less jails and more alternatives. This is the same sentiment that London Breed shares in the case of the No New SF Jail Coalition. In addition, Jon J. DiIulio wrote \\"Federal Crime Policy: Time for a Moratorium\\" which focuses on how juvenile offenders, drug offenders, and violent felons are many of the people being locked up in county jails, and that these prisoners do not need another jail, but instead systems to assist them with their problems and not perpetuate them further.DiIulio, John J. \\"Federal Crime Policy: Time for a Moratorium.\\" The Brookings Review 17.1 (1999): 17‚Äì21. Web. Stephen Joseph Perrello also contributes to this argument as he argues that while jails in San Diego are being given more funds due to overcrowding, these funds are not being put towards the programs that prisoners need most. He calls attention to the fact that more jails are only encouraging people to overlook the lack of programs.Perrello, Stephen Joseph. \\"Jail Expansion, Why?

The figure is a reference to the prelates who Hus condemned. In the lower part shows the death of St. Lawrence, while the figure on the right is identifiable with the Emperor Decius. On the outer side of the plate is left St. James the Greater pilgrim's staff and St. Lawrence deacon holding the book and palm branch. Contralateral altar wing (board 2 inv. No. 4336) has on the inside at the top of Passion of Sebastian, in the lower half of the burning of Jan Hus. On the outside is depicted St. James the Less, at the bottom of St. Stephen deacon. While the martyrdom of St. Sebastian depicts the Emperor Diocletian (left figure with a crown on his head), the \\"Burning\\" is dominated by the figure of a man with a princely cap. This represents Rhine Louis of Wittelsbach, which Sigismund handed Hus over to death. On the altar, cover it and Jan Hus assigned to prvomuƒçedn√≠k≈Øm Christian church ‚Äì St. James, Vol. Sebastian and St. Lawrence. The fact that the left bottom plate is shown \\"baking\\" St. Lawrence, while on the right wing is depicted the \\"burning of Jan Hus\\", is not accidental. These are parallels between the forms of martyrdom of the saints.  Dating  The altar wings are not dated nor signed. The time of their creation can be inferred either by comparing to the manuscript painters in contemporary context, or biographical content of the patron of the altar. Jaromir Pe≈°ina states that the author of the piece was in contact with St. George's altar, whose work dates to early in the second half of the 15th century, newly assigned to Czech late Gothic panel painting.Pe≈°ina J. Deskov√° malba. Milena Bartlov√° considered the painter as a member of the Prague workshop environment with knowledge of the Nuremberg masters (Hans Pleydenwurff) and Brussels patterns (Dirck Bouts).Bartlov√° M. Up√°len√≠ sv. Jan Royt states that the artist who painted panels was aware of the Wroc≈Çaw Master painting in the altar of St. Barbara,Dobrzeniecki T. A Central Panel of a Pentaptych (The legend of S. Barbara). which could be instrumental in these Western European influences. These conjectures allow dating the genesis of the retable in 1470 to 1480s. In the event that the purchaser of the altar was a Hussite captain Jakoubek of V≈ôesovice, who died in 1467, dating emergence retable it can be shifted to the 1460s. The Church of St. Wenceslas (Roudn√≠ky), for whose altar it was intended, is already mentioned as a parish in 1352, and was rebuilt in the Gothic style in 1486.  The wings' fate  In 1966, during restoration of the village church, students of the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague discovered two door panels on which were concealed, beneath overpainting, a baroque quality pre-medieval painting dating to the 1470s. Restoration of the original painted panels was done by Bohuslav and Ludmila Slan√Ω in 1975. The last conservation and restoration work on both boards conducted by academic painter Nadƒõ≈æda Ma≈°kov√° and Miroslav K≈ô√≠≈æek in the year 2013/14. The altar wings were bought from the Trmice parish in the Diocese of Litomerice for the amount of CZK 12 million paid from the funds of the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic. Today it is one of the most important artistic artefacts, in the Hussite Museum in T√°bor.  Art- historical importance  The finding of altar wings of Roudniky became one of the few documented Utraquist works in the development of painting in Bohemia after a period of stagnation on topics and painting techniques at the time of George of Podƒõbrady. It was a diversion in Prague acting \\"Master of St. George's altar\\" from a conservative home environment and the influence of Nuremberg painting from the mid-15th century, which influenced the anonymous Master. The Roudniky panels also likely originate from the Prague workshop environment. The meaning of the altar wings of Roudniky lies in their iconography. Illustrations of Jan Hus as a holy martyr are captured in their oldest form, as we know from the few surviving fragments of altars from the middle of the 15th century. This monumental painting presents us with Jan Hus as a man of small stature with a round face, beardless, dressed in a liturgical white shirt. His representation with other religious saints assigns him to providence, and the founding legitimacy of the early church. Utraquists needed to present their own saint, with the traditional saints, as one of the reasons their relationship to the paintings had religious themes. Conversely the painting served as a means of spreading reform ideas, but had a didactic function for laymen unfamiliar with iconography.Studniƒçkov√°, M.

They are best known for their desert textile art of the 20th century. Life During the 1950s, 1960, and 1970s Steiger was name associated with Southern Arizona fabric design. Together Harwood and Sophie Steiger would run the Tubac Steiger studio producing extraordinary silkscreen fabric design that would become synonymous with the Southern Arizona style in the post World War II era. Harwood Steiger  Harwood Steiger was born in 1900 in Fairport, New York. He studied painting at the Rochester Institute of Technology and took his first job as a colorist in a dye plant. That job would affect his later work in life. He then enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, taking every course they had to offer. After moving to New York City in the 1920s to make a name for himself, Harwood was swept into the depression, like the rest of the country. Undaunted, the entrepreneurial young man opened his own art studio and began teaching classes.The Society, Publications of the Rochester Historical Society, Volume 14, 1936 In the early 1930s, Harwood‚Äôs work was gaining acclaim. Continuing to teach, he opened a summer art school at Martha‚Äôs Vineyard called The Steiger Paint Group.The Steiger Paint Group, Art Digest, Volume 13, 1938 His artistic style drew on the social mores and themes of the era. Like Thomas Hart Benton, who also summered on Marta‚Äôs Vineyard, Harwood‚Äôs artistic style was on the forefront of the Regionalist art movement. He worked primarily in watercolor, sculpting his fluid figures in thick washes of color, using sharp dark lines to give his work a punctuating weight. His art explored the everyday experiences of ordinary people, a stylistic choice associated with the Work Progress Administration ‚Äì the WPA. The WPA, the largest and most ambitious of the New Deal agencies during the great depression, developed public work projects all over the country. In 1938, Harwood completed a mural for a post office in Fort Payne, Alabama.Davis, Anita Price, New Deal Art in Alabama: The Murals, Sculptures and Other Works, 2015. Sophie Steiger Harwood‚Äôs Martha‚Äôs Vineyard summer studio drew students from all over the country,The Vineyard Paint Group, Arts Magazine, Arts Digest Incorporated, Vol 15, 1940 including an attractive young schoolteacher named Sophie, an artist in her own right. She came from the country, with an artistic curiosity about botanicals and herbs. Her art reflected this interest ‚Äì plants and flowers were a central theme of her painting, utilizing watercolor to create delicate washes of tone and depth. The couple married. Tubac, Arizona In 1956, after a trip through northern Mexico, the Steigers fell in love with Arizona, and built a home and studio in Tubac, a small village 45 miles south of Tucson. The climate, history, and landscape reshaped their artistic interests. They also developed an interest in the technique of silkscreen, and fabric design.Brownell, Elizabeth R., They Lived in Tubac, Westernlore Press, 1986 Fabric Printing The couple worked closely in the design, development, and production. Their fabrics were a hit, earning national and international attention. Harwood would draw a design, and Sophie would decide if the work should be transferred to fabric, choosing the type of fabric and its base color. Harwood chose the silkscreen dye and would cut the designs into lacquer films. The stencils were placed on the silk screens and the dye brushed though the screens, a separate film and screen for each color.Miles, Harriet, From the Ashes of Tubac: a modern-day artist colony, Arizona Daily Star, c. 1975 The new fabric design was a departure from Harwood‚Äôs earlier work but retained a familiar graphic sensibility. These new functional works reflected both Harwood and Sophies‚Äôs artistic interests ‚Äì dozens of fabrics were decorative abstractions of botanical themes, others ruminations on desert animals and cactus.Cardon, Charlotte, Steiger Studio at Tubac Home, Tucson Daily Citizen, April 17, 1966. The couple produced 36 yards of fabric at a time, repeating the silk-screen process over and over down their long studio table. Legacy Over three decades, though hundreds of fabric designs, the Steigers created a vocabulary of graphic fabric patterning that became part of southern Arizona style. Their work offered a functional modernist interpretation of the Southwest. Although the studio closed in the 1980s after Sophie‚Äôs death, their influence is still present, not just in the tablecloths, curtains, dresses, and upholstery that sprinkle the interiors of houses throughout Tucson, but in a rich sophisticated style that continues to express the vision of post World War II southern Arizona.Sowell, Carol, Artist's banners set for Tubac's festival, Arizona Daily Star, January 31, 1980 The Steiger silkscreens are now part of the permanent collections of Pima Community College in Tucson, Arizona and the American Textile History Museum in Lowell, Massachusetts. Artwork The Steigers were designers who worked primarily in painting and textiles.

It resulted in a landslide victory for Republican candidate Charles H. Kline. Republican primary Incumbent Republican mayor William A. Magee's career took a downturn when he broke with state Senator Max G. Leslie, a party boss who had sponsored Magee's candidacy in the previous election. Leslie, determined to prevent the mayor's re-election, pushed for Judge Charles H. Kline of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas to succeed Magee. Kline attracted endorsements from other Republican leaders, including William Larimer Mellon, who along with his uncle Andrew W. Mellon was commonly (if not accurately) credited with controlling Pittsburgh politics. Faced with dwindling party support and a shortage of campaign funds, Magee withdrew from the field. With Magee out of the running, the Republican primary was just a formality as Kline trounced William L. Smith, principal of Allegheny High School. General election In the general election, Kline trampled his token opposition. His opponents were Smith, who had re-entered the race on Non- Partisan and Prohibition tickets, and little-known Democrat Carman C. Johnson, a teacher at Westinghouse High School. The Republican Party also won all seats by an overwhelming margin in the coinciding city council elections. Kline received 68,469 votes on the Republican ticket and 1,362 votes on the Labor Party slate. ‚Ä†Smith received 10,745 votes on Non-Partisan and 4,465 votes on Prohibition ballots.

Despite predictions for a close race, incumbent Moore successfully contested a second term in office with a decisive majority. The second-placed candidate, Balani, was 17,000 votes (15%) behind Moore. Two former Christchurch City Councillors, Gordon Freeman and Robin Booth, came third and fourth. Moore's main challenger, Balani, had a high profile as a talk back radio and television host; for many years, Balani had a show on Canterbury Television (CTV). A total of 14 candidates contested the 2001 mayoralty in Christchurch. Freeman was a city councillor for 15 years until he stood for mayor only in the 1998 mayoralty. Booth went into the election as a sitting member of Christchurch City Council. Results Moore, Balani and Freeman stood for mayor only. Robin Booth also stood for city councillor in the two-representative Shirley Ward, but came third and was thus defeated.

It was released in 2013 as fork of MooseFS. LizardFS is also offering a paid Technical Support (Standard, Enterprise and Enterprise Plus) with possibility of configurating and setting up the cluster and active cluster monitoring. LizardFS is a distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant file system. The file system is designed so that it is possible to add more disks and servers ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù, without the need for any server reboots or shut-downs.  Description  LizardFS makes files secure by keeping all the data in multiple replicas spread over the available servers. This storage is presented to the end-user as a single logical namespace. It can also be used to build space-efficient storage because it is designed to run on commodity hardware. It has applications in multiple fields and is used by institutions in finance, telecommunications, medicine, education, post-production, game development, cloud hosting services, and others.  Hardware  LizardFS is fully hardware agnostic. Commodity hardware can be utilized for cost efficiency. The minimum requirements are two dedicated nodes with a number of disks, but to obtain a high available installation at least 3 nodes are needed. This will also enable the use of erasure coding.  Architecture  LizardFS keeps metadata (e.g. file names, modification timestamps, directory trees) and the data separately. Metadata are kept on metadata servers, while data is kept on chunkservers. A typical installation consists of: * At least two metadata servers, which work in the master-slave mode for failure recovery. Their role is to manage the whole installation, so the active metadata server is often called the master server. The role of other metadata servers is to keep in sync with the active master server, so they are often called shadow master servers. Any shadow master server is ready to take the role of the master server at any time. A suggested configuration of a metadata server is a machine with fast CPU, at least 32 GB of RAM and at least one drive (preferably SSD) to store several GB of metadata. * A set of chunkservers which store the data. Each file is divided into blocks called chunks (each up to 64 MB) which are stored on the chunkservers. A suggested configuration of a chunkserver is a machine with large disk space available either in a JBOD or RAID configuration. CPU and RAM are not very important. You can have as little as 2 chunkservers or as many as hundreds of them. * Clients who use the data stored on LizardFS. These machines use LizardFS mount to access files in the installation and process them just like those on their local hard drives. Files stored on LizardFS can be seen and accessed by as many clients as needed.  Features  * Snapshots - When creating a snapshot, only the metadata of a target file is copied, speeding up the operation. Chunks of the original and the duplicated file are shared until one of them is modified. * QoS - LizardFS offers mechanisms that allow administrators to set read/write bandwidth limits for all the traffic generated by a given mount point, as well as for a specific group of processes spread over multiple client machines and mountpoints. * Data replication - Files stored in LizardFS are divided into blocks called chunks, each up to 64 MB in size. Each chunk is kept on chunkservers and administrators can choose how many copies of each file are maintained. For example, choosing to keep 3 copies (configuration goal=3), all of the data will survive a failure of any two disks or chunkservers, because LizardFS will never keep 2 copies of the same chunk on the same node. * Geo-replication - With Geo-replication you can decide where the chunks are stored. The topology feature allows for suggesting which copy should be read by a client in the case when more than one copy is available. For example, when LizardFS is deployed across two data centers, e.g. one located in London and one in Paris, it is possible to assign the label ‚Äúlondon‚Äù to each server in the London location and ‚Äúparis‚Äù to each server in the Paris location. * Metadata replication - Metadata is stored on metadata servers. At any time, one of the metadata servers also manages the whole installation and is called the master server. Other metadata servers remain in sync with it and are shadow master servers * High availability - Shadow master servers provide LizardFS with High Availability. If there is at least one shadow master server running and the active master server is lost, one of the shadow master servers takes over * Quotas - LizardFS support disk quota mechanism known from other POSIX le systems. It offers an option to set soft and hard limits for a number of files and their total size for a specific user or a group of users. A user whose hard limit is exceeded cannot write new data to LizardFS. * Trash - Another feature of LizardFS is a transparent and fully automatic trash bin. After removing any file, it is moved to a trash bin, which is visible only to the administrator. Any file in the trash bin can be restored or deleted permanently. * Native Windows‚Ñ¢ client - LizardFS Windows Client can be installed on both workstations and servers. It provides access to files stored on LizardFS via a virtual drive. The Windows client is a licensed feature to be obtained by contacting the creators of LizardFS - Skytechnology sp. z o.o. * Monitoring LizardFS offers two monitoring interfaces. First of all, there is a command-line tool useful for systems like Nagios, Zabbix, Icinga, which are typically used for proactive monitoring. Moreover, there is a graphical web-based monitoring interface available for administrators, which allows tracking almost all aspects of a system. * Hadoop - This is a java based solution allowing Hadoop to use LizardFS storage, implementing an HDFS interface to LizardFS. It functions as a kind of a File System Abstraction Layer. It enables you to use Hadoop jobs to directly access the data on a LizardFS cluster. The plugin translates LizardFS protocol and makes the metadata readable for Yarn and Map Reduce * NFS and pNFS - LizardFS uses NFS-ganesha server to create NFS shares, so technically NFS client connects not with the master server, but with a Ganesha file server that talks directly with LizardFS components. From the user point of view, it works just like an ordinary NFS server.

He was a popular Recorder of Dublin, a very unpopular Serjeant-at-law (Ireland), and an experienced parliamentarian who represented Midleton in the Irish House of Commons for many years.Hart, A.R. History of the King's Serjeants at law in Ireland, Dublin Four Courts Press (2000), p. 182. He is mainly remembered now as a close friend of Jonathan Swift, whose last known letter was written to him. Family  He was born in County Cork, son of George Stannard of Ballyhealy, who was a descendant of Captain Robert Stannard of Kilmallock (died 1655). Robert married Martha Travers, daughter of Sir Robert Travers, Judge of the Admiralty and MP for Clonakilty.Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society (1896), vol. 2, p. 324. The Stannards and Travers families were part of a wide- reaching network of interrelated landowning families: Eaton himself married one of his Travers cousins, Elizabeth, a great-granddaughter of Sir Robert Travers. Career  He entered the University of Dublin in 1702, and the Middle Temple in 1710. He was called to the Bar in 1714, and became King's Counsel and a Bencher of the King's Inns in 1726. The following year he entered Parliament as member for Midleton, whici he represented until his death. He was an energetic and conscientious MP, though he was apparently not much of an orator; one historian called him a \\"long-winded bore\\". On the other hand, he was a fine barrister, and gave a particularly effective performance in the celebrated Annesley peerage case of 1745, which inspired the novel Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson. He was elected Recorder of Cork in 1728, but decided not to take the appointment, for reasons which are not clear. He accepted the Recordership of Dublin in 1733 and held that office until 1750. Though he acted as a judge of assize in 1741, he never became a High Court judge; some attributed his failure to the enmity of Hugh Boulter, the influential Archbishop of Armagh, who had a habit of meddling in judicial appointments. = Friendship with Jonathan Swift = Stannard enjoyed the close friendship of Jonathan Swift, who held him in high regard. He was one of the executors of Swift's will. In 1734, Swift, who by his own admission took little interest in politics in general, wrote to Stannard asking him to canvass for a Mr Gorges, who was standing for Parliament, simply because Gorges was a brother of Swift's beloved friend Lucy, Lady Howth \\"whose commands I dare not disobey\\".Swift, Collected Works, edited by Sir Walter Scott (1824), vol. 19, pp. 306-307. Swift's last known letter dated 8 June 1741 was to Stannard, asking him to use his influence with his colleagues to advance the career of his young cousin William Swift, who had just started in practice at the Bar.Swift, \\"\\"Collected Works\\", vol. 19, p. 313. =Serjeant- at-law= Stannard had been a popular Recorder of Dublin, but the decision to appoint him Prime Serjeant in 1754 in place of Anthony Malone proved highly unpopular.Hart p. 96. Malone, who had been dismissed for querying the Crown's right to appropriate revenue, was regarded by the Government as effectively a member of the opposition, but he was held in high regard by the public, and despite Stannard's long experience of law and politics he was not Malone's equal in reputation as a lawyer. Even so, this hardly seems to explain the fury against Stannard, who was burnt in effigy. In any event the controversy was short-lived: Stannard, who was approaching seventy, fell ill in the spring of 1755 and died at his house at St Stephen's Green, Dublin. Marriage and children  By his wife and distant cousin Elizabeth Travers, daughter of John Travers, he had several children, including John, his heir, and Catherine (died 1819).Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh, Burke's Irish Family Records, London (1976), p. 390. John's only daughter and heiress Cassandra married the Reverend Charles Eustace of Robertstown, County Kildare in 1801, and had five children. As a result of this marriage the Stannard lands at Ballydoyle, County Cork passed into the Eustace family.Montgomery-Massingberd, p. 388.

Fasciculins are a class of toxic proteins found in certain snake venoms, notably some species of mamba. Investigations have revealed distinct forms in some green mamba venoms, in particular FAS1 and FAS2 Fasciculins are so called because they cause intense fasciculation in muscle fascicles of susceptible organisms, such as the preferred prey of the snakes. This effect helps to incapacitate the muscles, either killing the prey, or paralysing it so that the snake can swallow it. Fundamental mechanism of action The mechanism of action of the FAS proteins is associated with their ability to attach to molecules of the acetylcholinesterase in the muscles and their neuromuscular junctions, and thereby interfere with their necessary neuromodulatory inhibition. Molecular nature and physiological effect Fasciculins from mambas inhibit mammalian and fish acetylcholinesterases intensely, but are less active against the corresponding enzymes in insects, reptiles and birds. As one might expect of fast-acting venoms, they are fairly small proteins of about 61 amino acid residues. Their three-dimensional shape is three-fingered, and is secured by four cross-linking disulfide bridges. Disruption of acetylcholine signalling Venom disrupters of acetylcholine neurotransmission generally penetrate the neuromuscular junction, where they interfere with either the production or reception of acetylcholine, or the hydrolysis of acetylcholine after it has achieved its function of neurotransmission; mamba fasciculins prevent the final stage of this process by binding to acetylcholinesterase and blocking its action on acetylcholine; the result is that after the acetylcholine has transmitted the required stimulus, it continues with the stimulus after it has become inappropriate. That mechanism is in some ways similar to the effect of the so-called organophosphate nerve agents; the blockage of the acetylcholinesterase action is what causes the fasciculation that inspired the name fasciculin. Docking and activity In mammalian acetylcholinesterase two conserved peripheral anionic residues form part of the enzyme where the FAS molecule docks. Insect and avian acetylcholinesterases lack the two residues in those positions, and that drastically reduces their affinity for mamba fasciculins. However, there is a significant, though reduced, toxic effect, because several basic residues in the venom protein still establish and maintain contacts with the enzyme. This is unusual in protein complementarity, in that it involves attractions between multiple charged residues, but without any salt linkage between the molecules.

Enlisted in 1939, he later became a radio journalist alongside Claude Roy, but soon left the Vichy radio to join the ranks of the French Resistance. During the occupation, he worked on Combat, the clandestine newspaper of the Resistance, and participated in the Resistance radio movement with Maurice Bourdet and Pierre Schaeffer, preparing with this team of journalists the shows for the future \\"radio libre\\" (free radio) in a semi-secret Paris studio.

Life Ign√°c Franti≈°ek M√°ra (also commonly Ignaz or Ignatius Mara) was born in Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod, Bohemia, where he began his musical education. In 1742 he began his employment as a chamber musician at the Royal Court in Berlin, where he received an annual salary of 600 thaler. In his youth Mara was known as a fine soloist, whose tone and manner of performance were extremely moving. By 1779, while no longer performing as a soloist, he was noted as an excellent orchestral musician. He died in Berlin in 1783. Ign√°c's son, Johann Baptist also became a cellist and composer, active in Berlin. Johann Baptist was involved in a difficult marriage to the soprano Gertrud Elisabeth Mara. Ign√°c's younger brother, Kajetan, was an organist, choir director and composer of sacred music in St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague. Works Mara was said by Gerber to have been the most \\"correct\\" composer for the cello and composed many solos, duets and concertos for it. The only work which can be attributed with certainty to Ign√°c Mara is a Concerto in E-flat for viola, strings and continuo. The Concerto survives in two manuscript sources in the archive of the Sing- Akademie zu Berlin, and is ascribed in both sources to \\"Ignazio Mara\\". Any attempt to attribute further works to either Ign√°c, or his son Johann Baptist, is hampered by the fact that all other manuscripts are signed only \\"Mara\\".

Synopsis = Prologue = The prologue is set in 1798 in the Channel port of Saint-Malo, where the historical Surcouf was born. He is first portrayed as a young man, employed by a rich shipowner called Kerbiniou. Surcouf loves his employer's niece, Yvonne, but Kerbiniou forbids the marriage because Surcouf has no money. Resolving to earn enough to marry Yvonne, Surcouf volunteers for service in a privateer ship commanded by Maroof. Yvonne promises to wait for his return if he comes back within four years. = Act I = Surcouf returns to Saint-Malo with his new riches Four years have elapsed and an uneasy peace prevails between Britain and France. Surcouf has not returned; he is rumoured to be dead. Yvonne has remained faithful to her vow. Kerbiniou has married a young English widow, Arabelle, who has encouraged Yvonne to marry another Briton, Captain Thompson of the Royal Navy. Surcouf returns, vastly enriched by booty captured from British ships. But Yvonne is away, on a pilgrimage. Being a native of perfidious Albion Madame Kerbiniou, determined that her niece by marriage will marry Thompson, spins Surcouf a false story, telling him that Yvonne has already married the Englishman. Infuriated, Surcouf challenges Thompson to a duel. Before the duel can take place, Yvonne returns and the truth is discovered. Thompson, learning that France and Britain are now once again at war has his men ambush and overpower Surcouf. The British government has put a price on Surcouf's head, and he is carried on board Thompson's ship, which sets sail for England. Two of Surcouf's crew, Gargousse and Flageolet, having witnessed the kidnapping alert their shipmates and the pirate corvette sets off in hot pursuit of the British ship. Yvonne, anxious to join her lover, is on board. = Act II = The action takes place in a British Channel port, commanded by the preposterous and dim-witted Major MacFarlane. He is Arabelle Kebiniou's uncle, and she is in the town. Surcouf breaks free of his captors but in his flight he meets Arabelle. She is about to call the troops when he tells her that they are older acquaintances than she realises. It was he who rescued her from a crocodile while she was bathing in Sumatra. Arabelle ceases to be his enemy and becomes his firm friend. To protect him she introduces him to Major MacFarlane as her husband. When Kerbiniou appears on the scene MacFarlane takes him for the missing pirate and has him arrested. Captain Thompson's arrival clears up the error and Surcouf is arrested in Kerbiniou's place. Before he can be led to prison his men arrive, overcome the incompetent and cowardly English, and march off in triumph with their chief to their ship. = Act III = The final act is set at sea. Thompson's frigate pursues the privateers' corvette, but the plucky Frenchmen win the ensuing battle, capture the frigate and sail it into Saint-Malo. Surcouf's marriage to Yvonne concludes the opera. :Source: The Era.\\"The Drama in Paris\\", The Era, 15 October 1887, p. 15 Numbers alt=young man and bearded older man in early 19th century French sailor's clothes Costumes for Thompson and Arabelle alt=older man and younger woman in smart early 19th century French costumes *Prologue **Introduction and chorus ‚Äì Hol√†, Matelots **Duet ‚Äì Moi je suis Gargousse et moi Flageolet **Chorus ‚Äì Allons Robert **Couplets de Surcouf ‚Äì Chacun Ia voit √† ma mine **Couplets d'Yvonne ‚Äì Ayez foi dans l'avenir **Finale ‚Äì On va mettre √† la voile *Act I **Entr'acte **Rondeau-valse (Arabelle) ‚Äì J'avais emmen√© ma n√©gresse **Prayer (Yvonne and chorus) ‚Äì Sainte-Anne en qui j'esp√®re **Chorus ‚Äì Oui, c'est lui notre fameux corsaire **Air de Surcouf ‚Äì Oui, c'est mol mes amis **Trio (Arabelle, Kerbiniou and Thompson) ‚Äì Bravo, j'ai tout entendu **Duet (Yvonne and Surcouf) ‚Äì Vous avez dout√© de moi **Finale ‚Äì Entendez-vous *Act II **Entr'acte **Chorus of servants ‚Äì Pour que chacun puisse faire **Couplets d'Arabelle ‚Äì Mon premier √©tait d'un blond fade **Duet (Arabelle, Surcouf) ‚Äì C'est lui, le corsaire **Buffo duet (Gargousse and Flageolet) ‚Äì Belle Italie **Chorus of guests ‚Äì Puisque l'on nous invite **Ensemble ‚Äì O surprise √©tonnante **Waltz ‚Äì Tournoyons les valsons **Chorus ‚Äì Nous sommes pleins d'impatience **Finale ‚Äì Un l√¢che, ah c'est assez ***Air de Surcouf ‚Äì Bonsoir Angleterre *Act III **Entr'acte **Duet (Yvonne, Surcouf) ‚Äì Vogue, vogue, l√©ger navire **Couplets (Gargousse) ‚Äì Dedans l'Inde ou r√®gne Angleterre **Air de Surcouf ‚Äì Mon navire c'est beau **Finale ‚Äì Amis que dans St-Malo English version: Paul Jones Agnes Huntington in the title role in Paul Jones, the English adaptation of Surcouf, 1889 A Parisian critic observed after the premiere at the Folies-Dramatiques that the \\"patriotic bunkum\\" of the plot of the opera was calculated to appeal to French audiences but was unlikely to go down well in London. The critic speculated that the exaggerated anti-English sentiments might be the authors' revenge for the supposed slight to French naval courage in the \\"Poor parley-voo\\" song in Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore premiered in London earlier that year. For the English version of Surcouf, to which Planquette contributed some new numbers, the plot was completely overhauled. The adapter, H. B. Farnie, cut the prologue entirely and eliminated the Anglo-French hostilities.\\"Prince of Wales Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 14 January 1889, p. 2 He also reverted to an old tradition that Gilbert and Sullivan had striven to get away from: cross-dress casting ‚Äì the hero in this version was sung by the American contralto Agnes Huntington.Williams, p. 20 In the London version, entitled Paul Jones, the hero (a fictionalised version of the Scottish-American sailor John Paul Jones) is an apprentice to Bicoquet, a ship's chandler in Saint-Malo. He loves his employer's niece, Yvonne, but she is already being wooed by Don Rufino, a rich and well-connected Spanish naval officer. Paul is told that if he can earn a million francs he will be considered as an alternative suitor. Kestrel, the American captain of a privateer ship comes to Saint-Malo to recruit crew members. Paul, together with two locals, Bouillabaisse and Piere, joins him. Three years pass. Bicoquet has married Rufino's sister, and Yvonne is on the point of being married to Rufino. Paul returns in time, having gained the necessary money by piracy, but Rufino has him taken prisoner. The last act shifts the scene to the island of Estella where the governor, Don Trocadero, is expecting his nephew Rufino. Bricocquet arrives, and as Paul is rumoured to have escaped Bricoquet is taken for him and arrested. Paul and his crew arrive and overpower the Spaniards, and he is then able to marry Yvonne.\\"The London Theatres\\", The Era, 20 January 1889, p. 16 The piece opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre on 13 January 1889.

Anderson was selected by the Braves with the third overall pick of the 2016 MLB draft. He made his major league debut in 2020. Career =Amateur baseball= Anderson played in the 2013 14U Babe Ruth League World Series in Moses Lake, Washington, with his team from Clifton Park, New York. Anderson's team finished third, and he was named to the all-defensive team as a pitcher. The squad was managed by Tom Huerter, father of teammate Kevin Huerter, with whom Anderson would play high school baseball. Anderson attended Shenendehowa High School in Clifton Park, New York. As a junior, he was 6‚Äì1 with a 0.66 earned run average (ERA) and 91 strikeouts. In August 2015 he played in Perfect Game All-American Classic at Petco Park. That same summer he played for the 18U National Team that won the World Cup. In 2016, he helped lead his high school to a Class AA state championship. He committed to play college baseball at Vanderbilt. Minor leagues Anderson was considered one of the top prospects for the 2016 MLB draft. He was selected by the Atlanta Braves with the third overall pick and signed with the team for $4 million.

On August 5, Anderson was promoted to the Gwinnett Stripers, and made his International League debut the next day. At the end of the season, Anderson won the Braves' organizational pitcher of the year award. =Atlanta Braves= Anderson was invited to spring training in 2020. Following the cancellation of the 2020 Minor League Baseball season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Atlanta Braves placed Anderson on its initial list of up to 60 players eligible to play for the team during the shortened Major League Baseball season. On August 25, 2020, Anderson was promoted to the major leagues for the first time, and his contract was selected to the active roster. He debuted in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees, going through the first innings without yielding a hit. Anderson completed six innings, giving up one earned run on a home run by Luke Voit. Anderson finished the 2020 season with a 3-2 record over 6 games started and 32 innings, posting a 1.95 ERA with 41 strikeouts, while giving up just 21 hits. He was fifth in the NL with 4 wild pitches. He relied mostly on his 95 mph fourseam fastball, 88 mph changeup, and 80 mph curveball, and only rarely threw a 92 mph sinker. On October 1, 2020, making his first postseason appearance, Anderson earned the win against the Cincinnati Reds, clinching the Wild Card Series for the Braves. He became the youngest pitcher in MLB postseason history to allow fewer than three hits while striking out nine while pitching at least six innings.

In the minors, Anderson used his curveball more frequently against right-handed batters. By the time he reached the major leagues, Anderson's changeup had improved markedly. His arm angle has stood out to teammates, as it is higher than most pitchers.

Ben committed to play baseball for Binghamton University. He eventually decided to attend Binghamton University instead of signing with the Blue Jays.

In order to broadcast legally, the operators of the station formed a civil association, Autogesti√≥n Comunicativa, A.C., and began working to obtain a permit. However, the Federal Broadcasting and Telecommunications Law, promulgated in July 2014, replaced permits with two types of concessions: public use, for stations owned by local, state and federal governments and public universities, and social use, for all other noncommercial stations. Two further subdivisions were established in the social use category, community and indigenous. When Autogesti√≥n Comunicativa was awarded its social community concession by the IFT in November 2015, it was the first time that such a concession had been awarded, enshrining community radio stations in Mexican law; the concession was received in February 2016. The new station, broadcasting as XHSILL-FM on 106.7 MHz, was also the first social station assigned to the new reserved band (106-108 MHz) set aside for broadcasters of this type. While it was the first new social community radio station (with a federal concession) on air, with testing beginning in July 2016, XHSILL was not the first social community radio station to operate. In April 2016, the IFT transitioned the existing permit of XEYTM-AM, an operating radio station in Teocelo, Veracruz, to a social community concession.

Background  At age 18, John Canut of Bon entered the Society of Jesus in Balaguer, Leida. It is likely that he was of low socioeconomic status and was in training to become a tailor. After two years of training, he declared his religious vows and was sent to the Jesuit College of Tortosa by the tailor shop he was working at. The political situation in Spain at the time (Carlist Wars between clergy and laity) made it difficult for Canut of Bon to stay in the country, so he was reassigned to Argentina where he learned homeopathy. He later moved to Chile and then retired from the Jesuit Order in 1871, not because he lost his Catholic faith, but because he wanted to study. In 1872, he settled in The Andes where he devoted himself to the sale of fabrics and continued to work as a tailor. In August 5 of that year, he married Virginia Aguilar Robles, with whom he had three children. In December 1876, he found a copy of the New Testament on a platform of a railway station in Quillota from the Bible Society of Valparaiso. He defined this episode as the first meeting he had with the Gospel. In 1880, he had the opportunity to meet a Presbyterian preacher named Robert MacLean, with whom he became friends. Canut of Bon then went on to become the first Spanish-speaking preacher in Chile. His preaching in a country that was mostly Catholic led him to become a sort of outcast amongst from the foreign Presbyterians who feared deportation from Chile for violating the rules contained in the Constitution of 1833, which gave priority to the Official State Church over other religions. Canut of Bon was soon expelled for his new religion. He asked for a reinstatement to the Catholic Church in 1884 in Curico. However, his \\"Catholic Period\\" came to an end in 1888, when he met an American Methodist pastor named William Taylor (1821-1902) who preached in Africa and India between 1856 and 1883. In 1890, Canut of Bon was consecrated as bishop of the Methodist faith. His way of preaching, which was spirited and filled with knowledge, attracted many. However, this also meant that many enemies and his previous clients abandoned him. Despite this, he began to preach full-time, relying on his knowledge in the field of homeopathy to stay in the area. To avoid rejection from the Catholic priests, he enlarged his preaching territory to southern cities and places where the Catholic Church had much less of an influence. For five years, he preached the Gospel and founded churches in Coquimbo, La Serena, Concepcion, Traiguen, Angol, Los Angeles, Victoria, and Temuco. Unfortunately, in 1896, he had to move to Santiago for health reasons where he died on November 9. His remains rest in the Patio of Dissenters of the General Cemetery of Santiago.  Legacies  In the context of secular struggles caused by the non-separation of church and state, his style of street preaching caused him persecution and ridicule, but also a group of followers who decided to call themselves \\"Canutos,\\" or \\"Followers of Canut.\\" In the early twentieth century, a writer and anarchist, Jose Santos Gonzalez Verades, described police officers arresting a group of evangelicals preaching and singing their way into prison, proclaiming themselves to be Canutos. Although this term has been extended to all members of evangelical churches, whether of not they are followers of Canut of Bon, on occasion, the term is used to refer to any very religious person who effusively professes his or her religion in public. Some sectors of the evangelical cult reject this nickname and consider it burlesque, but it is accepted by the vast majority of evangelicals.

The site is located in the middle of the Salso river valley, at 704 m above sea level, near San Cataldo in the province of Caltanissetta, in a strategic location for communication between the southern coast of Sicily and the northern part of the island. It has a NE-SW orientation and stretches along in parallel with the SS 122 San Cataldo- Serradifalco. This archaeological site developed over time on five small hills in close proximity to one another. It represents an important example of a Greek settlement in central Sicily, having apparently taken on increasing amounts of Greek cultural forms as a result of Greek people arriving from Rhodes and Crete, via Akragas. The site's position is critical for controlling the central Salso river valley.Francesco Lauricella, Vassallaggi, Storia e archeologia di una citt√† greca della Sicilia interna. Tip. Ed. Vaccaro a cura del Comune di San Cataldo, 1990 p.5 & 9 The site, known already in the 19th century, only became the subject of excavation from 1905. These excavations continued until the 1960s and produced brilliant results, including the discovery of considerable evidence for human habitation from the Bronze Age until the first centuries CE. Remains of walls, houses, streets, tombs and religious sites provide evidence of a prosperous community. Numerous items, some perfectly preserved, are now on display in various museums throughout Sicily. History The site first developed in the Bronze Age (18th-14th centuries BC), from which time some cave tombs of the Castelluccio culture survive and a circular hut with furniture, located on the hill looking towards San Cataldo. This original site was heavily altered by later periods of settlement. The most ancient inhabitants of Vassallaggi, were presumably the Sicans of the early Bronze Age, whose presence is indicated by red-painted pottery with geometric motifs from the 2nd millennium tombs; kilns typical of that group were found nearby. No finds have come to light from the middle and late Bronze Age, so these hills may have been abandoned at that time; this might be a result of emigration towards the coast from the middle Bronze Age and then as a result of the preference for more defensible sites in face of the arrival of the Sicels (which might have taken the form of an invasion). Thus the site was unoccupied for about 700 years, before a Sican settlement developed here in the 8th century BC. This new habitation during the Iron Age continued until Greek occupation of the site in the 5th century, when the village seems to have been fortified and to have developed within the sphere of Akragas. After the foundation of that city by Gela (most powerful of the Dorian colonies founded in the 7th century BC), a period of expansion of Greek origin people began which led to the colonisation of central Sicily, using the natural route along the Himera river valley (the modern Salso). The expansion into inland Sicily may be explained by the demographic pressure on the Greek communities of the motherland and the other Greek colonies. The need to augment agricultural production and open new markets for manufactured goods may also have been a causal factor. The site of Vassallaggi, however, based on archaeological evidence, was only conquered and colonised by Greeks from Akragas in the 6th century BC, unlike nearby sites, like Sabucina, Capodarso and Gibil Gabib which were colonised by Gela, as shown by the proto-Corinthian style pottery found there, which is never found at Vassallaggi.Francesco Lauricella, Vassallaggi, Storia e archeologia di una citt√† greca della Sicilia interna. Tip. Ed. Vaccaro a cura del Comune di San Cataldo, 1990 p. 29-31 The most important discoveries in the rich necropolis, both in terms of quantity and quality of items recovered, derive from this period. They include ceramic sarcophagi, one of which is perfectly preserved, locally-made vases, pottery from other Greek areas, bronze knives, spears and strigils, as well as coins. A temple for the worship of a female deity was built at this time. The absence of concrete evidence (e.g. inscriptions, money coined on site) makes it difficult to attribute any known ancient place name to the location. It has been suggested that the site is Motyon, the first fortified centre in the Acragantine area. The city was inexplicably abandoned around 320 BC. There are no traces of objects after this date. From the Roman period, traces of small nucleated settlements are found in the valley and the surrounding territory, including especially important routes to Akragas. Christian tombs, dating to the 5th century AD have been found, near the prehistoric caves.

After signing to Factory Benelux in 1982 following their \\"noisy\\" and \\"goofy\\" debut album Different Measures, Drastic Movement (1979), the band settled into a new, less aggressive sound featuring influences of industrial music and funk. Recording Sparks in a Dark Room in late 1981, the band headed for a more clinical and clean sound. Considered a high point of the ultra movement, the record features cold, electronic tones and darkly humorous lyrics from lead singer and songwriter Wally van Middendorp. Released by Factory Benelux in May 1982, the album was not a commercial success but its critical standing has become increasingly positive. The album has since been regarded as a lost classic. Uncut described it as an \\"under-the-radar-masterpiece\\" whilst Careless Talk said it \\"places Minny Pops squarely within the realm of an early 80s interface that pitched accessible pop conveniences and electronic experimentation in the same arena.\\"Careless Talk review Today it is considered part of the origins of dark wave and industrial dance music. The album was remastered and re-released in March 2003 by LTM with numerous bonus tracks, and by Factory Benelux in March 2014 with even more bonus material, namely a live album recorded at the Melkweg in 2012. Background Minny Pops were formed in Amsterdam in 1978 by vocalist Wally Van Middendorp. The band took their name from the primitive Korg drum machine which propelled their austere, post-punk rhythms and provocative live performances. The band made their recording debut in 1979 on the label Plurex, operated by van Middendorp himself.Minny Pops  Biography & History  AllMusic The three-track seven-inch single contained \\"Kojak,\\" on which Van Middendorp impersonated Telly Savalas' TV character of the same name with lines like \\"If you make more money, you make fewer friends.\\" Later on in the year, the band released their debut album Drastic Measures, Drastic Movement, showcasing the band's \\"lean, mechanical sketches and abrasive noise diversions.\\" Brainwashed called it \\"a bizarre mix of noise, new wave, synth pop, and Yello-like cabaret goofiness. It is one of the most genuinely tweaked documents of DIY electro-pop, a record which to this day causes heads to be scratched in satisfying bewilderment.\\"Brainwashed - Minny Pops \\"Sparks in a Dark Room\\" & \\"Secret Stories\\" Their earliest releases on Plurex and praise visa word of mouth lead to a record deal with independent post-punk record label Factory Records of Manchester, England, who gave the band the opportunity to work with Martin Hannett, producer of Joy Division and later early New Order. They subsequently became the first Dutch band to record a Peel Session for radio DJ John Peel's BBC Radio 1] show. After a handful of gigs in support of Joy Division and the release of a live EP, Minny Pops had officially joined the label, but during 1981 and 1982, bounced between Factory proper and Factory's secondary Factory Benelux division, run in Belgium. According to Brainwashed, \\"as the group's members acquired careers as record label executives (at Boudisque, Play it Again Sam, etc.), the music that they produced became more accessible, the noise nearly vanished, and recognizable industrial-funk genre trappings emerged.\\" Subsequently, in their new musical style, they recorded their second album shortly after the deal with Benelux. Recording and musical style The album was recorded by and self-produced by the band in late 1981. Recorded without a guitarist, Sparks in a Dark Room is therefore often said to sound unusually polished and layered, and has been described as a \\"lavish extension\\" of its predecessor, opting for a cleaner and more clinical synth-focused sideMinny Pops - Sparks In A Dark Room.

The soup is made from kidney beans with vegetables served in broth seasoned with garlic, pepper and other spices. Origin The dish is derived from Dutch Cuisine influence on colonial Indonesia, adopted by people of Eastern Indonesian provinces. The name \\"brenebon\\" is local Manado pronunciation of Dutch bruine bonen; bruine means \\"brown\\", while bonen means \\"beans\\", thus bruine bonen means \\"brown beans\\" or \\"red beans\\" (kidney beans). Ingredients The meat used for brenebon usually washed and soaked in water for a night. Then the meat is boiled for a period of time until soft and done. Then the red kidney beans are poured and boiled in the broth, spiced with the mixture of spices, such as shallot, garlic, salt, sugar, pepper, nutmeg and clove. Then sliced vegetables are boiled together, such as green beans, celery and scallion. Then the soup is usually served with steamed rice and hot and spicy sambal chili sauce. In its original Dutch and Minahasa version, pig's trotters are usually employed as the base of rich and thick soup broth. The rich gelatinous pig's trotters gave a pleasant thick and glistening texture of the soup broth. Nevertheless, since this soup is also popular across Indonesia as everyday soup served in common Indonesian households, various versions exist. This include a halal version, which replaces pork trotters with cow's trotters, ribs or bony parts of beef. A variant called sayur asem kacang merah uses beef-based broth and tamarind-based soup similar to sayur asem to add sour freshness.

The first mention of this family was in 1326 document which recorded that certain Ilija Nikolin Zaguroviƒá from Bar moved to Kotor and bought a house. He and his family became nobility when he married with Ru≈æa Nucije Gile from Kotor. Nikola Zaguroviƒá was mentioned in one document dated 8 August 1397. Stefan Zaguroviƒá, great-grandfather of poet Ilija, was mentioned in 1420 as member of the Great Council of Venice. In 1437 Laurencije Zaguroviƒá was a trader in Kotor. Ilija Zaguroviƒá, the grandfather of poet Ilija Zaguroviƒá, died in 1492. He had three sons, Franjo, Laurencije (Lovro) and Bernard. Franjo, who was a judge, died in 1516. He had a son Ilija (died in 1557) who was a notable poet. Bernard had two daughters, both married to members of Bona family. Laurencije distinguished himself during the defense of Venetian held Kotor from Ottoman attacks in 1503. His son Trifun was a member of the Venetian Senate as representative of Kotor in 1553. Trifun Zaguroviƒá was also notable trader in Kotor who was Kotor's deputy in Venetian Senate in 1459 and 1463. One of the most notable members of Zaguroviƒá family was Jerolim Zaguroviƒá. He was Catholic. Notable poet Ilija Zaguroviƒá was uncle of Jerolim Zaguroviƒá. This branch of Zaguroviƒá family was related to the Serbian Crnojeviƒá family through the marriage of Jerolim Zaguroviƒá and Antonija Crnojeviƒá, the daughter of Lord ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá of Zeta (r. 1489‚Äì96).

First, it is known that, by construction, the ground state energy will be exactly estimated. This is an improvement over the standard WKB approximation, which often has weaknesses at lower energies. Another property is that a class of potentials known as shape invariant potentials have their energy spectra estimated exactly by this first-order condition.

Founded in 1923, it is one of the oldest state parks in Iowa. Between 1990 and 1995 one area was named nationally recognized historic district and five structures were individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Picnic Shelter A group of local citizens met in Forest City in August 1920, and 158 of them contributed $7,000 to buy the land. The state paid them for the same amount and acquired the land in 1921, and dedicated the park in 1923, making it one of the oldest units in the state park system in Iowa. The park was partially developed in the 1920s. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Company 1757 came from working at Dolliver State Park on April 7, 1934 to build several major buildings and structures and to landscape the park. They completed their work on October 8, 1934 and then moved on to Council Bluffs. At its inception the park was before it grew to in 1936, and was reduced to in 1942. The state has subsequently added more property. On November 15, 1990 the observation tower, picnic shelter, amphitheater, one set of entrance portals (Area 5a), and a trail area were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A second set of entrance portals (Area 5b) were added on April 17, 1995. The park was part of a larger study of Iowa's state parks called the . =Observation tower= The observation tower is located at the top of Pilot Knob. It is in the middle of a cleared area surrounded by timber. The tower is composed of two elements: a circular tower and a timber shelter in the rear. The tower rises to a height of . It was designed, like all the historic structures in the park, in the rustic style by the Central Design Office in Ames. The walls are composed of rubble granite that taper slightly. A metal staircase is located on the interior. At the top of the tower is a metal floor and a waist-high wall. The shelter features a gable roof that is held up by round timbers. =Picnic shelter= The picnic shelter is located on a grassy area near timber southwest of Dead Man's Lake. It measures . It features random rubble limestone at the rear of the structure and on the adjacent, partial side walls. A chimney is centered along the rear wall. Four round timber posts support the gable roof on the front. It has a poured concrete floor. =Amphitheater= Amphitheater The outdoor amphitheater is located in a small valley that is surrounded by timber in the eastern part of the park. It features four sections of seats on the hill that face a turf stage. The seating is composed of wood planks that rest on stone piers. A low, random, retaining wall of rubble stone encircles the south half of the opening behind the seats. Another rubble retaining wall is located behind the half circle turf stage. There are rubble stone stairs set in concrete that lead away from the amphitheater in the back. Two more sets of rubble steps flank the stage and are held in place by a retaining wall along the front. The amphitheater measures . =Portals= There are two sets of entrance portals that flank entrance-ways on the north side of the park. They are both composed of two random rubble limestone pillars that differ somewhat in shape. The portals at the main entrance (Area 5a) on the northwest side of the park includes two rectangular pillars, one high and the other high. The second pillar has two lower, flanking wings. At one time the second pillar carried a wood sign that was suspended from a rounded timber bracing. The sign is now located in front of the pillar. The northeast entrance (Area 5b) likewise has two pillars of differing heights. These pillars are and high. The second pillar has side wings, and it retains its suspended sign. Both entrances have two rounded timber gates that close the entrance. =Trail Area= Trail Area with a culvert in the center The original trail features three random rubble limestone culverts that cross gullies. They measure from to in length and in width. The trails and culverts form a historic district. Land use The park includes Pilot Knob Lake, a man-made lake for boating, fishing, and ice skating in the winter. It also includes Dead Man's Lake, a floating sphagnum bog. It is the only one of its kind in Iowa. The bog area is home to a variety of flora and waterfowl. The park also features trails for hiking and horseback riding, camping, picnic areas and shelters. There is a warming house with electricity and heat for winter sports enthusiasts. The Pilot Knob Recreation Area is located north of the park and its activities include hunting, hiking, and snowmobiling.

Elected as a UK Independence Party (UKIP) candidate, he subsequently left the party in January 2020. He characterises himself as a social conservative. Early life Born to a British mother and Jamaican father, Kurten graduated with a first-class BSc in Chemistry from the University of St Andrews in 1993, a PGCE from the University of Bath in 1995, and completed a MRes in Chemistry at the University of Southampton in 1998.‚ÄòKURTEN, David Michael‚Äô, Who's Who 2017, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2017 Before entering politics, he had taught the subject for over 15 years in both private and state schools in the UK, Bermuda, Bosnia‚ÄìHerzegovina, Botswana and the USA.  Political career  Kurten was second on the UK Independence Party additional member list in the 2016 London Assembly election and succeeded in being elected to the London Assembly. In October 2016, Kurten announced his intention to stand for UKIP leader following the resignation of Diane James after just 18 days. However, he withdrew from the contest and joined fellow London Assembly Member Peter Whittle in endorsing Paul Nuttall. Following the contest, Nuttall appointed Kurten as UKIP Education spokesperson on 30 November 2016. Kurten was seen as a front-runner to lead the party in the 2017 UKIP leadership election. When Henry Bolton was elected as leader in October 2017, Kurten finished in third place. Kurten stepped down from the UKIP frontbench on 22 January 2018 in protest at Bolton's refusal to stand down as leader after he received a vote of no confidence from UKIP's National Executive Committee the previous day. He returned after Gerard Batten became leader on 14 April. In the May 2018 local elections, Kurten contested his local Sidcup ward in the London Borough of Bexley but he failed to be elected. He then unsuccessfully stood as UKIP's candidate in the Lewisham East by-election on 14 June 2018, getting 380 votes (1.7%) and coming sixth. In December 2018, Kurten again resigned from the UKIP frontbench, this time on account of the anti-Islam direction of UKIP under the party's then-leader Gerard Batten, most significantly Batten's appointment of far-right activist Tommy Robinson as an \\"advisor\\". He remained a member of the party, but disbanded the UKIP group on the London Assembly forming the Brexit Alliance group with Peter Whittle, who had resigned his UKIP membership altogether following Robinson's appointment. In October 2019, Kurten announced his intention to stand as a UKIP candidate in the constituency of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in the 2019 general election after the Brexit Party announced they would not be contesting seats won by the Conservative Party in the 2017 election. In January 2020, Kurten announced he would be running as an independent candidate in the upcoming London mayoral and London Assembly elections (then scheduled for 2020 but both elections later postponed to 2021). He then formed the Heritage Party as a limited company in May of that year, which applied for registration with the Electoral Commission on 17 July.

Ideal lattice Definition: Rotational shift operator on \\\\R^n (n \\\\geq 2) is denoted by \\\\operatorname{rot} , and is defined as: : \\\\forall \\\\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{n-1},x_n) \\\\in \\\\R^n: \\\\operatorname{rot}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{n-1},x_n) = (x_n,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{n-1}) =Cyclic lattices= Micciancio introduced cyclic lattices in his work in generalizing the compact knapsack problem to arbitrary rings.Micciancio, Daniele. [Generalized compact knapsacks, cyclic lattices, and efficient one-way functions from worst-case complexity assumptions.] Foundations of Computer Science, 2002. Proceedings. The 43rd Annual IEEE Symposium on. IEEE, 2002. A cyclic lattice is a lattice that is closed under rotational shift operator. Formally, cyclic lattices are defined as follows: Definition: A lattice \\\\mathfrak{L} \\\\subseteq \\\\Z^n is cyclic if \\\\forall \\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{L}: \\\\operatorname{rot}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{L} . Examples: Fukshansky, Lenny, and Xun Sun. [On the geometry of cyclic lattices.] Discrete & Computational Geometry 52.2 (2014): 240‚Äì259. # \\\\Z^n itself is a cyclic lattice. # Lattices corresponding to any ideal in the quotient polynomial ring R = \\\\Z[x]/(x^n-1) are cyclic: consider the quotient polynomial ring R = \\\\Z[x]/(x^n-1) , and let p(x) be some polynomial in R , i.e. p(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix^i where a_i \\\\in \\\\Z for i = 0,\\\\ldots, n-1 . Define the embedding coefficient \\\\Z -module isomorphism \\\\rho as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\quad \\\\rho: R & \\\\rightarrow \\\\Z^n \\\\[4pt] \\\\rho(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix^i & \\\\mapsto (a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}) \\\\end{align} Let I \\\\subset R be an ideal. The lattice corresponding to ideal I \\\\subset R , denoted by \\\\mathfrak{L}_I , is a sublattice of \\\\Z^n , and is defined as : \\\\mathfrak{L}_I := \\\\rho(I) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}) \\\\mid \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix^i \\\\in I \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\Z^n. Theorem: \\\\mathfrak{L} \\\\subset \\\\Z^n is cyclic if and only if \\\\mathfrak{L} corresponds to some ideal I in the quotient polynomial ring R = \\\\Z[x]/(x^n-1) . proof: \\\\Leftarrow) We have: : \\\\mathfrak{L} = \\\\mathfrak{L}_I := \\\\rho(I) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}) \\\\mid \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix^i \\\\in I\\\\right\\\\\\\\} Let (a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}) be an arbitrary element in \\\\mathfrak{L} . Then, define p(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix^i \\\\in I . But since I is an ideal, we have xp(x) \\\\in I . Then, \\\\rho(xp(x)) \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{L}_I . But, \\\\rho(xp(x)) = \\\\operatorname{rot}(a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}) \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{L}_I . Hence, \\\\mathfrak{L} is cyclic. \\\\Rightarrow) Let \\\\mathfrak{L} \\\\subset \\\\Z^n be a cyclic lattice. Hence \\\\forall (a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}) \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{L}: \\\\operatorname{rot}(a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}) \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{L} . Define the set of polynomials I: = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix^i \\\\mid (a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}) \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{L} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : # Since \\\\mathfrak{L} a lattice and hence an additive subgroup of \\\\Z^n , I \\\\subset R is an additive subgroup of R . # Since \\\\mathfrak{L} is cyclic, \\\\forall p(x) \\\\in I: xp(x) \\\\in I . Hence, I \\\\subset R is an ideal, and consequently, \\\\mathfrak{L} = \\\\mathfrak{L}_I . =Ideal lattices Craig Gentry. Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using Ideal Lattices. In the 41st ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), 2009.http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lai/5359-aut13/05.Gentry-FHE-concrete- scheme.pdf = Let f(x) \\\\in \\\\Z[x] be a monic polynomial of degree n . For cryptographic applications, f(x) is usually selected to be irreducible. The ideal generated by f(x) is: : (f(x)) := f(x) \\\\cdot\\\\Z[x] = \\\\\\\\{ f(x)g(x): \\\\forall g(x) \\\\in \\\\Z[x] \\\\\\\\}. The quotient polynomial ring R = \\\\Z[x]/(f(x)) partitions \\\\Z[x] into equivalence classes of polynomials of degree at most n-1: : R = \\\\Z[x]/(f(x)) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix^i: a_i \\\\in \\\\Z \\\\right\\\\\\\\} where addition and multiplication are reduced modulo f(x). Consider the embedding coefficient \\\\Z-module isomorphism \\\\rho. Then, each ideal in R defines a sublattice of \\\\Z^n called ideal lattice. Definition: \\\\mathfrak{L}_I, the lattice corresponding to an ideal I, is called ideal lattice.

Remark:Peikert, Chris. [A decade of lattice cryptography.] Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2015/939, 2015. # It turns out that \\\\text{GapSVP}_\\\\gamma for even small \\\\gamma = \\\\operatorname{poly(n)} is typically easy on ideal lattices. The intuition is that the algebraic symmetries causes the minimum distance of an ideal to lie within a narrow, easily computable range. # By exploiting the provided algebraic symmetries in ideal lattices, one can convert a short nonzero vector into n linearly independent ones of (nearly) the same length. Therefore, on ideal lattices, \\\\mathrm{SVP}_\\\\gamma and \\\\mathrm{SIVP}_\\\\gamma are equivalent with a small loss.Peikert, Chris, and Alon Rosen. [Efficient collision-resistant hashing from worst-case assumptions on cyclic lattices.] Theory of Cryptography. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2006. 145‚Äì166. Furthermore, even for quantum algorithms, \\\\mathrm{SVP}_\\\\gamma and \\\\mathrm{SIVP}_\\\\gamma are very hard in the worst-case scenario. Short integer solution problem SIS and Ring-SIS are two average case problems that are used in lattice-based cryptography constructions. Lattice-based cryptography began in 1996 from a seminal work by Ajtai who presented a family of one-way functions based on SIS problem. He showed that it is secure in an average case if \\\\mathrm{SVP}_{\\\\gamma} (where \\\\gamma = n^c for some constant c>0) is hard in a worst-case scenario. =SISn,m,q,Œ≤= Let A \\\\in \\\\Z^{n\\\\times m}_q be an n\\\\times m matrix with entries in \\\\Z_q that consists of m uniformly random vectors \\\\boldsymbol{a_i} \\\\in \\\\Z^n_q: A = [\\\\boldsymbol{a_1}\\\\cdots\\\\boldsymbol{a_m}]. Find a nonzero vector \\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\in \\\\Z^m such that: * \\\\\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\beta * f_A(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) := A\\\\boldsymbol{x} = \\\\boldsymbol{0} \\\\in \\\\Z^n_q A solution to SIS without the required constraint on the length of the solution (\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\beta) is easy to compute by using Gaussian elimination technique. We also require \\\\beta < q, otherwise \\\\boldsymbol{x} = (q,0,\\\\ldots,0) \\\\in \\\\Z^m is a trivial solution. In order to guarantee f_A(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) has non-trivial, short solution, we require: * \\\\beta \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{n\\\\log q}, and * m \\\\geq n\\\\log q Theorem: For any m = \\\\operatorname{poly}(n), any \\\\beta > 0, and any sufficiently large q \\\\geq \\\\beta n^c (for any constant c >0), solving \\\\operatorname{SIS}_{n,m,q,\\\\beta} with nonnegligible probability is at least as hard as solving the \\\\operatorname{GapSVP}_\\\\gamma and \\\\operatorname{SIVP}_\\\\gamma for some \\\\gamma = \\\\beta \\\\cdot O(\\\\sqrt{n}) with a high probability in the worst-case scenario. =Ring-SIS= Ring-SIS problem, a compact ring-based analogue of SIS problem, was studied in.Lyubashevsky, Vadim, et al. [SWIFFT: A modest proposal for FFT hashing.] Fast Software Encryption. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2008. They consider quotient polynomial ring R = \\\\Z[x]/(f(x)) with f(x) = x^n-1 and x^{2^k}+1, respectively, and extend the definition of norm on vectors in \\\\R^n to vectors in R^m as follows: Given a vector \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{z}} = (p_1,\\\\ldots,p_m)\\\\in R^m where p_i(x) are some polynomial in R. Consider the embedding coefficient \\\\Z-module isomorphism \\\\rho: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\rho: R \\\\rightarrow \\\\Z^n \\\\[3pt] \\\\rho(x) & = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix^i \\\\mapsto (a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}) \\\\end{align} Let \\\\boldsymbol{z_i} = \\\\rho(p_i(x)) \\\\in Z^n. Define norm \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{z}} as: : \\\\\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}\\\\ := \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\\\\\boldsymbol{z_i}\\\\^2} Alternatively, a better notion for norm is achieved by exploiting the canonical embedding. The canonical embedding is defined as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma: R = \\\\Z/(f(x)) & \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n  p(x) & \\\\mapsto (p(\\\\alpha_1),\\\\ldots,p(\\\\alpha_{n}) \\\\end{align} where \\\\alpha_i is the i^{th} complex root of f(x) for i=1,\\\\ldots, n. =R-SISm,q,Œ≤= Given the quotient polynomial ring R = \\\\Z[x]/(f(x)), define R_q:= R/qR = \\\\Z_q[x]/(f(x)). Select m independent uniformly random elements a_i \\\\in R_q. Define vector \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}:=(a_1,\\\\ldots,a_m) \\\\in R_q^m. Find a nonzero vector \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}:=(p_1,\\\\ldots,p_m) \\\\in R^m such that: * \\\\\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\beta * f_{\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}}(\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}) := \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}^{\\\\,t}.\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{z}} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m a_i.p_i = 0 \\\\in R_q Recall that to guarantee existence of a solution to SIS problem, we require m \\\\approx n\\\\log q. However, Ring-SIS problem provide us with more compactness and efficacy: to guarantee existence of a solution to Ring-SIS problem, we require m \\\\approx \\\\log q. Definition: The nega-circulant matrix of b is defined as: : \\\\text{for} \\\\quad b = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}b_ix^i \\\\in R, \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{rot}(b) := \\\\begin{bmatrix} b_0 & -b_{n-1} & \\\\ldots & -b_1 \\\\[0.3em] b_1 & b_0 & \\\\ldots & -b_2 \\\\[0.3em] \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\[0.3em] b_{n-1} & b_{n-2} & \\\\ldots & b_0 \\\\end{bmatrix} When the quotient polynomial ring is R = \\\\Z/(x^n+1) for n = 2^k, the ring multiplication a_i.p_i can be efficiently computed by first forming \\\\operatorname{rot}(a_i), the nega-circulant matrix of a_i, and then multiplying \\\\operatorname{rot}(a_i) with \\\\rho(p_i(x)) \\\\in Z^n, the embedding coefficient vector of p_i (or, alternatively with \\\\sigma(p_i(x)) \\\\in Z^n, the canonical coefficient vector). Moreover, R-SIS problem is a special case of SIS problem where the matrix A in the SIS problem is restricted to negacirculant blocks: A = [\\\\operatorname{rot}(a_1)\\\\cdots\\\\operatorname{rot}(a_m)].Langlois, Adeline, and Damien Stehl√©.

The work was commissioned by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra to commemorate the centenary of the ANZAC landing at Gallipoli during World War I. The text was written by the Australian musician Paul Kelly. It was given its world premiere on April 22, 2015 at the Sydney Opera House by the Gondwana Chorale and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under the conductor Richard Gill.Ledger, James (2015). War Music: Programme Note. Retrieved May 6, 2016. Composition War Music has duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in two movements. The first movement reflects the violence of the war, while the second is cast as memorial for those lost. Thus, the second movement features less of the orchestral instruments and the addition of the choir. Ledger described the composition process in the score program notes, writing: The text was written by the Australian musician Paul Kelly during an otherwise inactive year and takes the perspective of the soldiers at Gallipoli. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for SATB choir and a large orchestra comprising three flutes (2nd doubling piccolo; 3rd doubling piccolo and alto flute), three oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais), two clarinets (2nd doubling bass clarinet), contrabass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, four percussionists, celesta, and strings. Reception War Music has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Peter McCallum of The Sydney Morning Herald described it as one of Ledger's \\"strongest scores\\" and remarked, \\"In the first part, ominous, sometimes militaristic ideas mixed with scattered sounds, bumps and fleeting fragments in finely textured music that loomed in waves towards peaks of intensity, serenity and portentousness. The second part brought in the voices of the Gondwana Centenary Chorale with guest members from France, Turkey and New Zealand for an intimate and anguished setting of a poem by Paul Kelly written as though through the voices of the slain.\\" James McCarthy of Limelight similarly observed, \\"Ledger is resourceful enough to keep our interest, offering many rewards during the course of the work. With his imaginative orchestration, Mr. Ledger is becoming one of our best composers.\\" At a later performance by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the New Zealand Youth Choir, William Dart of The New Zealand Herald wrote, \\"James Ledger's War Music took 20 minutes for its first movement to travel from brooding mysteries to full symphonic fury, with the musicians easily meeting the Australian's directives of 'bellicose and vehement.'\\" He continued, \\"Less belligerent, shorter and more affecting was the following movement in which the New Zealand Youth Choir added a skilfully layered setting of Paul Kelly's words, powerfully linking past and present, war and peace.\\" References Category:Compositions by James Ledger Category:2015 compositions Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:Choral compositions Category:Music commissioned by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra Category:ANZAC ","title":"War Music (composition)"},{"id":"50448863","text":"Peleopoda navigatrix is a moth in the family Depressariidae.

Shaw, a 17-year-old Los Angeles High School football player, was shot by two Hispanic men while returning home from the Beverly Center. Shaw was taken to a hospital, where he later died. A gang member, Pedro Espinoza, was later apprehended and convicted of the murder. Because Espinoza was an illegal immigrant who had just been released from jail, the shooting sparked controversy and political debate over Los Angeles' status as a sanctuary city, and over Special Order 40. Backgrounds =Jamiel Shaw II= Jamiel \\"Jas\\" Andre Shaw, II (December 22, 1990Jamiel Andre Shaw, Born 12/22/1990 in California. California Birth Index. Retrieved Sep 25, 2016. - March 2, 2008) was a junior at Los Angeles High School. He played football, basketball, baseball, the piano, and ran track. On the morning of his murder, he had participated in a weekend football training program, that prepares top high school football players for college football and for a possible career in the National Football League. Shaw was also being prospected by several colleges, including Rutgers University and Stanford University. Shaw's mother Anita was serving her second tour in Iraq at the time of his death. =Pedro Espinoza= Pedro Espinoza (born 1989) was a member of the 18th Street Gang and was residing in the U.S. illegally. He had previously been arrested in November 2007 on gun charges and assault on a police officer. He was given a four-month early release from jail on March 1, 2008. He murdered Shaw the next day. A day after Shaw's murder, Espinoza reported to his probation officer. Shooting In the early evening of March 2, 2008, Shaw was returning home from the Beverly Center. He was walking from the bus stop when his father, Jamiel Sr., called him on his phone. Shaw answered the phone and told him he was nearby. He was three blocks away from his home when he was killed. At about 8:40 p.m., two Hispanic men jumped out of a white car, confronted Shaw, and asked him what gang he belonged to. When he did not answer quickly enough, they shot him. Shaw's father heard the gunshots, ran outside, and stayed by his son until medical personnel arrived. Shaw was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:55 p.m. Shaw was first shot in the stomach, causing him to fall to the ground. While he was on the ground with his hands over his head, he was shot through his hands, with the bullet then traveling into his face. Within an hour of Shaw's murder, Espinoza was found in a park by a Culver City police officer who was not aware of the shooting. Because the park was closed, he was told to leave. The officer wrote down the license plate number of his vehicle and later shared it with the Los Angeles Police Department. Espinoza was later arrested. Legal proceedings Espinoza was formally charged with first-degree murder. He was convicted on May 9, 2012. The guilty verdict also included special circumstances, which made Espinoza eligible for the death penalty. On May 23, 2012, the jury sentenced Espinoza to death. =Lawsuit= In 2009, the Shaw family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Los Angeles County and Sheriff Lee Baca. The suit also alleged negligence, violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and deprivation of civil rights. In 2010, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles F. Palmer determined that the defendants were legally immune from the action, and dismissed the lawsuit. Funeral Shaw's funeral was held on March 11, 2008, at the West Angeles Church of God in Christ. Reaction Shaw's murder sparked criticism and political debate over Los Angeles' sanctuary city policy and Special Order 40, which aimed to strengthen community safety by disallowing local officials from questioning a resident's immigration status, thus enabling local victims of crime to file reports without fear of deportation. In rapper Ice Cube's music video \\"Why Me?\\", the Jamiel Shaw case is prominently featured. =Jamiel's Law= In response to the controversy, the Shaw family is supporting \\"Jamiel's Law\\", which would rescind Special Order 40. Mayoral candidate Walter Moore campaigned as a supporter of this initiative. An attempt to get this proposal onto the May 2009 election ballot failed, when supporters did not gather enough signatures. =Reaction from victim's family= Shaw's parents became supporters of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Shaw Sr. was featured in a Trump television advertisement, and spoke at several Trump rallies.

History \\"Stonie\\" ginger beer bottles from three generations of Ladd family One of many patterns of pottery \\"stonie\\" bottles used by Ladds for ginger beer until around 1930 Joseph Onesimus Ladd (c. January 1818 ‚Äì 12 June 1882) was born in Nacton, Sussex and emigrated to Australia, arriving in Adelaide around 1847 via Melbourne, Victoria. In 1849 he was granted a publican's licence for the Gepp's Cross Hotel. He married Caroline Fuller (c. 1828 ‚Äì 2 August 1897) in Adelaide on 6 April 1853. They had thirteen children. He set up a ginger beer manufacturing business in Flinders Street, Adelaide, around 1860. In 1868 he moved to a half-acre block on Rundle Street, between Wilcox's drapery and Allott's pharmacy. Shortly after, he began to manufacture cordials and aerated waters the following year. He had some connection with Mauritius, the nature of which is not clear. It is conceivable, but by no means certain, that he used his contacts on that island for his supplies of sugar and/or ginger. J. O. Ladd died at Lockleys in 1882 and his wife Caroline Ladd (c. 1828‚Äì1897) took over the business, moving the factory to Harrow Road, College Park in 1884, equipped with all the latest machinery. The family lived at the same address. This choice of location was no doubt due to the purity of spring water available in the area: Woodroofe's and Hall's soft drink factories and Cooper's brewery all took advantage of the same water. As with their competitors, Ladds used many kinds of bottles over the years, including various \\"stonie\\" pottery bottles, and in glass the Codd pattern (with the internal glass ball seal), Barrett or Riley pattern (with a Vulcanite \\"screw- top\\" threaded stopper) in the bottle and, from around 1930, crown seal types. Bottles remained the property of the drink manufacturer, and if undamaged could be steam-cleaned and re-used over and over again. Mrs. Ladd purchased second-hand bottles from dealers (\\"marine store collectors\\") and instructed her bottle-washers and fillers to use all bottles, no matter what the brand. This was against the rules of the Aerated Waters and Cordial Makers' Employ√©s' Union, (It was some 20 years before the manufacturers had a similar agreement) and the men refused to do so, and threatened strike action if forced to disobey Union Rules. Mrs. Ladd's motives were financial: she purchased secondhand bottles for 8d. per dozen, whereas new bottles cost 36s. per gross (3s. per dozen). In today's money that would be around $5.00 v. $22.00 per dozen.[RBA inflation calculator] Caroline died in 1897 and her son Joseph Ladd (1856‚Äì1929) took over management of the factory. Joseph had married Mary Cunningham (1861‚Äì1931) in 1888. Their son Roy Leslie Joseph Ladd (1892‚Äì1954) married Jessie Ann Sutherland (1890‚Äì1976) in 1917; they lived at 143 Wattle street, Malvern. Joseph died in 1929 and his son Roy took over the business, and around this time adopted the (horseshoe) Magnet trade mark. In early 1948 the family business was restructured as a limited liability company, and in June 1950 a new entity called J. L. Aerated Waters Ltd. was founded to take over the assets of J. Ladd Ltd. A month later the new company was renamed \\"Ladds Limited\\". Roy Ladd died in July 1954 and three months later the company was liquidated. Assets were disposed of included the property at Harrow Road, St. Peters, and the right to the trade name \\"Spa-Kup\\".

Mauno Arnold Kuusisto (November 3, 1917, Tampere ‚Äî August 29, 2010, Tampere), was a popular Finnish vocalist and opera singer (tenor), as well as an actor.  Early life  Mauno Arnold Kuusisto was born on November 3, 1917 in Tampere, Finland. Kuusisto was orphaned when he was just a few weeks old and was subsequently taken in by his grandparents who also lived in Tampere. He resided in a Finlayson workers' house during the remainder of his life as a child and then by the time he was a teenager he began to work for the company. Kuusisto completed his schooling at the Pyynikin old vocational school. However, he was offered a place as a model carpenter at Finlayson which he accepted and began to work before the Winter War. He worked for Finlayson until the year of 1957.  Career  Mauno Kuusisto initially participated in Finlayson's musical activities. Since then, Kuusisto began to study singing and visited choirs and quartets in Tampere. He had his first concert in 1952 in Tampere. In the Tampere Opera he sang a total of twenty-one operas and operetta roles. Tampere orchestra leader Eero Kosonen gladly paid him for these roles. Kusisto also visited the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki, Finland, twice. Kuusisto appeared as part of the cast in these operas mostly between 1952‚Äì1968. Kuusisto became a familiar radio personality in the 1950s. In 1930 Rudolfo Falvon composed the song \\"Kertokaa se h√§nelle\\" (\\"Tell it to him\\") which Kuusisto sang in 1959. As a result, Kuusisto rose to popularity among audiences and \\"Tell it to him\\" reached gold record sales in Finland. With 47,000 initial sales, \\"Tell it to him\\" is Finland's best-selling domestic single.

After wide-margin wins on both her starts as a juvenile, the filly won the Forward Gal Stakes on her first appearance of 2016 and followed up in the Davona Dale Stakes. She sustained her first defeat when odds-on favorite for the Ashland Stakes but rebounded to win the Oaks on May 6. Background Cathryn Sophia is a bay filly bred in Maryland by Robert Manfuso. She was sired by Street Boss, a sprinter who won the Bing Crosby Handicap and the Triple Bend Handicap in 2008. The best of his other progeny have included Rapper Dragon, Danza (Arkansas Derby) and The Quarterback (Newmarket Handicap). Cathryn Sophia's dam Sheave was an unraced daughter of the 2003 American Horse of the Year Mineshaft, and a distant female-line descendant of the 1923 Kentucky Oaks winner Untidy. In September 2014 the yearling filly was consigned to the Fasig-Tipton Mid-Atlantic Eastern Fall sale and was bought for $30,000 by Charles J Zacney. She entered the ownership of the Zacney's Cash Is King Stable. Cathryn Sophia has been trained throughout her racing career by John Servis, best known as the trainer of Smarty Jones. Racing career =2015: two-year-old career= Cathryn Sophia began her track career in a six furlong maiden race at Parx on October 30, 2015 and won by twelve and three quarter lengths from eight opponents. On December 5 she faced better opposition in the Gin Talking Stakes over seven furlongs at Laurel Park and won by more than sixteen lengths from Prognosis. =2016: three-year-old career= Cathryn Sophia began her second season at Gulfstream Park on January 30 when she started the 1/10 favorite for the Grade II Forward Gal Stakes over seven furlong. Ridden by Joel Rosario she started slowly, but took the lead in the stretch and drew away to win by five and a half lengths from Island Saint. Four weeks later at the same track the filly was partnered by Javier Castellano in the Davona Dale Stakes and again started at long odds-on. She took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and quickly went clear of her rivals to win by seven lengths from Lewis Bay. Servis commented \\"I was concerned today about the distance a little bit, and obviously, the way she ran, I feel a whole lot better\\". The Grade I Ashland Stakes on April 9 at Keeneland saw Cathryn Sophia matched against the Spinaway Stakes winner Rachel's Valentina and the Golden Rod Stakes winner Carina Mia in a major trial race for the Kentucky Oaks. The three market leaders engaged in a sustained struggle over the last quarter mile but were overtaken in the final strides by the late-running outsider Weep No More who won by a neck from Rachel's Valentina with Cathryn Sophia a neck further back in third place. Following the filly's defeat Servis considered dropping the filly back in trip for the seven furlong Eight Belles Stakes but decided to go for the Oaks after the likely favorite Songbird was scratched. On May 6 Cathryn Sophia faced Weep No More and Rachel's Valentina again in the Kentucky Oaks, with the other runners including Lewis Bay, Terra Promesa (Fantasy Stakes), Land Over Sea (Fair Grounds Oaks) and Go Maggie Go (Gulfstream Park Oaks). Ridden by Castellano, she raced in fourth before switching to the outside to make her challenge on the final turn. She took the lead, went clear of the field, and won by two and three quarter lengths from Land Over Sea, with Lewis Bay a neck away in third place. She then went on to win the un-graded Princess of Sylmar Stakes on September 3 as a prep for the GI Cotillion. She finished 3rd behind champion Songbird and that years GI Acorn Stakes winner Carina Mia in the GI Cotillion Stakes. After the Cotillion Stakes Cathryn Sophia was retired.

In August 2017, it was announced that Tandem would fully acquire Harrods Bank, in a deal that would bring a near-¬£200m loan book, over ¬£300m of deposits and nearly ¬£80 million of capital.  Features  Tandem has introduced an 'Autosavings' feature, designed to help users save money. Using a number of rules, the account automatically puts money aside based on the user's spending habits. Tandem has launched two versions of credit cards. The first, called Journey, has been launched for people with limited credit history, helping them build up their credit score. The Cashback card gave users 0.5% cashback on worldwide purchases, with an initial credit limit from ¬£500 to ¬£12,000. On 8 January 2020, Tandem announced it would be discontinuing its Cashback card, replacing it with the Tandem Membership. Tandem Membership launches on 9 March 2020, with any existing Cashback card holders having their accounts closed.  Subsidiaries  = Tandem Bank = Tandem Bank is a British bank based in London, wholly owned by Tandem Money. It is focused on banking through mobile applications.  History of Tandem Bank  Tandem originates from Tandem Money, a UK challenger bank that obtained its banking licence in 2015 and subsequently lost it. In 2018, Tandem Money acquired Harrods Bank and renamed it as Tandem Bank, to operate under its existing licence. This allowed the business to continue trading. The company was founded by Ricky Knox, Matt Cooper and Michael Kent in 2013. Prior to its sale to Tandem Money, Harrods Bank catered for high-net-worth (HNW) individuals and operated from the Harrods store in Knightsbridge, London. It offered a variety of personal and business current and savings accounts, mortgages, foreign currency and gold bullion trading services. In 1991, the House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee ordered the Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Robin Leigh- Pemberton, to order the owners of Harrods, Mohamed Al-Fayed, and his brother Ali Al-Fayed, to transfer control of the Harrods Bank to trustees after they found that the Fayeds were not \\"fit and proper\\" to run the bank. On 7 August 2017, Tandem Money Limited announced a deal to acquire 100% of Harrods Bank Limited shares. The purchase deal closed successfully on 11 January 2018. In March 2018, Tandem agreed to acquire Pariti Technologies Limited, developers of the Pariti money management application.

Cogswell designed The Tangier pub in 1912. The Graham Arms pub in George Street, Fratton, built in 1900. Arthur Edward Cogswell (1858, Peterborough ‚Äì 1934, Portsmouth) was an English architect, particularly active in the Portsmouth area. Cogswell, the Peterborough-born son of a wood carver, was an architect who, although not well known nationally, left a strong mark on the appearance of Portsmouth lasting until this day. He arrived in Portsmouth in the early 1870s and served an apprenticeship with a prominent local architect, George Rake (1829‚Äì1885), with whom he worked on the new gaol in Kingston (the former HM Prison Kingston) and Milton Lunatic Asylum (now St James' Hospital). After serving his apprenticeship, Cogswell later became a partner in Rake's business, becoming known as Rake and Cogswell. George Rake died aged 56 on 30 November 1885, and Cogswell continued the business. In 1888, Cogswell registered as a Member of the Society of Architects and received his first public commission at Portsmouth's Kingston Cemetery, where Cogswell designed \\"a new Caretaker's Lodge, Entrance Gate and railings\\" at the cemetery's northern entrance at New Road, which was opened in 1891. Arthur Cogswell built a reputation of his own and was a friend of John Brickwood, a fellow Freemason who commissioned him to design many of the Brickwood's public houses in the Portsmouth area. He was also responsible for local shops, banks, churches, schools, cinemas, theatres and, in the early 1900s, the Carnegie Library in Fratton Road to which he gave his services for free. His style is very recognisable throughout the city. During his career, Cogswell also served with the Artists Rifles, a volunteer regiment of the British Army Reserve, during World War I. Cogswell designed two cinemas in Portsmouth, the New Classic Cinema and the Palace Cinema, and the Gaiety Cinema in Gosport, all of which have since closed. He designed over twenty pubs in Portsmouth, including The Talbot at 207 Goldsmith Avenue, Southsea built in 1896 for Brickwood's brewery in Brewer's Tudor style, and the Grade II listed The Tangier, 61/63 Tangier Road, Baffins built in 1912 for Portsmouth United Breweries. Cogswell is also credited for designing the early Fratton Park stadium buildings for Portsmouth F.C.. Arthur Edward Cogswell died at the age of 76 in early October 1934, receiving only a 75-word obituary notice in the Portsmouth Evening News, which named him as a \\"Doyen of City architects\\" and a \\"Great Sportsman\\", but yet received no such recognition from national architectural or trade publications ‚Äì despite his membership of the Society of Architects. Cogswell's two sons carried on the family business, AE Cogswell & Sons, which rebuilt Clarence Pier, Southsea in 1961. Portsmouth football connections Arthur E. Cogswell was an enthusiast of association football and founded Portsmouth Association Football Club, an amateur football team which had Sherlock Holmes creator, Arthur Conan Doyle as their goalkeeper, who played under the pseudonym A.C. Smith. Portsmouth AFC were disbanded in 1896. Although only speculation, it may be theorised that Arthur Edward Cogswell, a football enthusiast and acquaintance of Brickwood Brewery owner John Brickwood (through his career as a pub architect), may have influenced John Brickwood to form a new football club. John Brickwood became the chairman of the syndicate which formed Portsmouth Football Club on 5 April 1898. In 1899, Cogswell designed Fratton Park's first South Stand, called The Grand Stand, which measured \\"100 feet long with seven rows of seats on the south side\\" and was built on the southern side of the pitch. In 1900, Cogswell built a Brickwoods Brewery public house named \\"The Pompey\\" next to Fratton Park at 44 Frogmore Road. The owner of the Brickwoods Brewery was John Brickwood, the first chairman of Portsmouth F.C. In 1905, Cogswell built a mock Tudor club pavilion in the south west corner of Fratton Park which served as the Portsmouth F.C. club offices and players dressing rooms. The pavilion originally featured a tall clock tower spire and a spectator gallery. Sadly, in 1925 the original Grand Stand and part of the club pavilion (including its clock tower) were cleared to allow space for a new, larger South Stand built by Archibald Leitch, but the distinctive mock Tudor entrance fa√ßade of the pavilion still exists in Frogmore Road today.

Businessman Donald Trump scored a decisive victory in the state, defeating Senator Marco Rubio by nearly 20 points. Rubio had previously vowed to continue his campaign regardless of the results in Florida, but suspended his campaign after the state was called for Trump. Results  Analysis  Donald Trump won a landslide victory in Florida by a margin of 18.7 percentage points against 3 other candidates on the ballot, and carried every county besides Miami-Dade (won by Marco Rubio). Donald Trump had several significant investments in the state through his real estate company. According to the New York Times, Mr. Trump \\"was able to appeal to voters with his message of economic populism and his hard line on immigration\\" in the Sunshine State. According to exit polls, Trump swept all age groups, income levels, and educational attainment levels. His particular area of strength was with whites without a college degree, whom he won 54-22 over Marco Rubio. Trump also won born-again and Evangelical Christians 46-24, and white born-again Evangelical Christians 49-19. He also carried Protestants 45-24 and Catholics 50-33. In terms of voters' primary concerns, Trump won over all groups, performing particularly well among those who worried about terrorism (he won 60-16) and those who worried most about the economy (he won 43-30). He won a particularly large victory among those whose family financial situation was \\"falling behind\\", among those who called themselves \\"dissatisfied\\" or \\"angry\\" about the federal government, and among those who said they felt betrayed by Republican politicians. He won among voters who said the U.S. support for Israel is \\"Not Strong Enough\\" 48-26. An overwhelming majority of voters said they support Trump's proposed Muslim ban. Trump swept most regions of the state, winning in the Panhandle with 48 percent (Rubio, 25%; Cruz, 21%; Kasich, 7%), in Orlando with 49 percent (Rubio, 27%; Cruz, 17%; Kasich, 5%; Carson, 1%), in the Tampa Bay area with 46 percent (Rubio, 23%; Cruz, 18%; Kasich, 10%), and in the Gulf Coast and Mid- Florida with 48 percent (Rubio, 21%; Cruz, 18%; Kasich, 7%; Carson, 1%). Rubio, for his part, won in Miami 42-39 as compared to Trump (Cruz, 10%; Kasich, 6%; Carson, 1%). While Trump won the state's white vote 51-22 as compared to Rubio, Rubio won Florida's Hispanic/Latino vote 52-26 as compared to Trump, which was 15% of the state's electorate.

The existence of this property can be shown by performing Fourier analysis on signals derived from segments of DNA sequences. Because of its predictive power, it has been used as a preliminary indicator in gene prediction. DNA sequences are inherently signals as they are functions of an independent variable, position on the sequence. Thus, signal processing methods can be applied to them after the symbolic string is properly mapped to one (or more) numerical sequences. The reason for this periodicity is due to the biased distribution towards codon triplets, which is a consequence of genetic code degeneracy; while non-coding segments are uniformly randomly distributed and produce no significant signal in the frequency space.  History  This property has been dissected, tested and derived in a chronology of papers from different universities. The initial discovery was made in 1980 by Trifonov and Sussman who observed periodicity in DNA sequences by applying the autocorrelation function to chromatin DNA. Silverman and Linsker defined the Fourier transform of a sequence of bases, described how to \\"fourier analyze\\" it and proposed sample applications of this technique. Tsonis, Elsner and Tsonis did Fourier analysis of coding, non- coding and random sequences and proposed a reason for the 3-periodicity property found in coding sequences. Dodin proposed a method for analyzing the periodicity of DNA sequences based on the correlation function of the symbolic sequence. Tiwari, Ramachandran, Bhattacharya and Ramaswamy examined the signal-to-noise ratio of the period-3 peak within a sliding window over a sequence to identify likely coding regions.  Coding vs. Non-Coding DNA  DNA stores the information required to assemble, maintain and reproduce every living organism. A protein is a large molecule (\\"macromolecule\\") made up of smaller subunits, amino acids. DNA sequences are made up of codons, three-long nucleotide stretches, that correspond to specific amino acids. DNA creates RNA which then helps synthesize proteins. Thus, coding DNA is defined as the sections of the genome that are actually transcribed into amino acids in proteins. Noncoding DNA is sections of a DNA sequence that don't necessarily code for proteins. Identification of coding regions is important, as this information can be used in gene identification and then more generally full- genome annotation.  Formal Statement of the Property  The 3-periodicity property states that the spectral energy :S[k]^2 = A[k]^2 + T[k]^2 + C[k]^2 + G[k]^2 derived from the DFT's of the four binary signals representing a DNA protein coding region of length N, exhibits a peak at discrete frequency k=N/3.  Technical Details  =DNA Sequences as Numerical Sequences= Formally, a DNA sequence s[i] is an ordered list of symbols from a dictionary of nucleotides (A,C,T,G). There are multiple ways to view this as a numerical sequence, and they will all be applied to the same example: :s[i] = \\\\\\\\{A, T, G, C, A, G, C\\\\\\\\} * Binary Projection Define a binary signal for each nucleotide, U_{\\\\alpha}[i], which is 0 when the i-th position in the sequence is the nucleotide \\\\alpha and 1 otherwise. Formally, : u_{\\\\alpha}[i] = \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\\\\\{ & \\\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & s[i]\\\\, \\\\text{is} \\\\,\\\\alpha 0 & \\\\text{o/w} \\\\end{array} \\\\end{array} This creates four signals which encode the position of the four nucleotides in the sequence. For the above example, the projected signals would be ATGCAGC, u_a = 1000100, u_c = 0001001, u_t = 0100000, u_g = 0010010 * Correlation Function Let E(i,j) be a function that is 1 if s[i] = s[j] and 0 otherwise. Let c[t] = \\\\sum_{i=t}^N E(i, i-t). In other words, it counts the number of times that the nucleotide at a position is equal to the nucleotide t-away on the sequence. It is invariant to changing the labeling of the bases. c[0] will always be equal to the length of the sequence. For the above example, the projected signals would be c(0) = 7, c(1) = 0, c(2) = 0, c(3) = 2, c(4) = 1, c(5) = 0, c(6) = 0 * Linear Map For mathematical purposes, a gene sequence could be viewed as a signal by mapping each nucleotide into the range [1,4]. For the example above and map \\\\\\\\{A -> 1, T -> 2, C -> 3, G -> 4\\\\\\\\}, the sequence would manifest itself as 1243143. This process generates a single signal for the sequence, but raises questions such as which out of 24 (4!) maps should be used and what effect does this map have on our analysis. Unlike the other two mapping methods, this one is not invariant to changing the labeling of the bases but having the same structure (i.e. AACA -> TTGT), which could be detrimental for some applications. =Spectral Analysis of DNA Sequences= Once the DNA sequence has been converted into a numerical sequence, spectral analysis can be performed on that sequence. Recall the DFT is defined by the analysis equation X[k] = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\\\cdot e^{-2 \\\\pi i k n / N}, and produces a N-long complex signal X[k] that represents the spectrum of the signal. The index k of the frequency response corresponds to an angular frequency \\\\omega of 2 \\\\pi k / N. For the 3-base periodicity property, the frequency content at k = N / 3 should be analyzed as it corresponds to a period of 3. Recall that the power spectra of a sequence is equal to the magnitude of the frequency vector squared, P[k] = X[k]^2 Tiwari applied the DFT to analysis of DNA sequences using the binary projection operator. They calculated the spectra of the four projected nucleotide sequences using the DFT. Call them C_{A}[k], C_{C}[k], C_{T}[k], C_{G}[k]. Then, the power spectra of all the signals were combined, C[k] = C_{A}[k]^2 + C_{C}[k]^2 + C_{T}[k]^2 + C_{G}[k]^2. Then, they calculated the Signal-to-Noise ratio of this signal and performed a threshold test on that value to determine whether or not that stretch of DNA is coding. =Anti-Notch Filter= Instead of computing a Discrete Fourier Transform on different segments of the signal, the analysis can be performed in the time-domain through the use of an anti-notch filter at frequency N/3, which is much faster and performs a similar operation. An anti-notch filter applied to the signals essentially approximates the magnitude of the DFT at N/3, and a similar method is used to threshold this value to determine whether or not the window is coding or non-coding. Vaidyanathan and Yoon implemented and evaluated this method. An ideal anti-notch filter at frequency N/3 has an impulse response of :h[n] = e^{2 \\\\pi n j / 3} and thus the frequency content of the output of an anti-notch filtered signal is X[k] = A[N/3] if k=N/3 and 0 otherwise. By taking the magnitude of the time-domain signal, and invoking Parseval's Theorem, we get the magnitude of the frequency response. By the above logic, this is just A[N/3]^2 which is the quantity of interest. =Spectrograms= Spectrograms are a good way to view how the frequency content of a signal changes over time. The most common way to compute a spectrogram is to compute a Fourier transform over different segments of the signals, convert the frequency magnitude plot into an image, and concatenate those images. This is a useful way to visually identify coding and non-coding regions of DNA and to inspect other patterns that might exist. =As a Feature in Gene Identification= Identifying genes in a DNA sequence is harder than just finding what segments are coding and near impossible to identify by visually inspecting spectrograms. Genes are made up of both coding and non- coding regions, called introns and exons. Thus, the transition between coding and non-coding regions must be examined and analyzed properly to identify genes. Computing the \\"level\\" of 3-periodicity over different (possibly overlapping) windows of the sequence generates a plot of 3-periodicity over time. These long stretches of coding vs. non-coding can then be classified as introns or exons and the entire segment heuristically labeled as gene or non- gene. =Why Can it Discriminate Coding from Non-Coding?= Binary signals can be parsed into something called a position count function (PCF), which counts the number of one's at phase s at positions that are multiples of \\\\omega. This is expressed mathematically for a binary signal A as :C_w^A (s) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\frac{N-1}{\\\\omega}} A[\\\\omega i + s]. For \\\\omega=3, there are three PCFs (C_3^A(0), C_3^A(1) and C_3^A(2)) which each count the number of one's at positions \\\\\\\\{0,3,6,...\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{1,4,7,...\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{2,5,8,...\\\\\\\\} respectively. It can be shown that the magnitude of the DFT at N/3 is in fact directly related to the PCF and is equal to :\\\\tilde{A}[N/3]^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2} [(C_3^A(0) - C_3^A(1))^2 + (C_3^A(1) - C_3^A(2))^2 + (C_3^A(2) - C_3^A(0))^2]. In other words, the spectral power at N/3 in the DFT depends only on the difference between the PCFs at different phases. This relation here is the fundamental to the explanation for why this method can identify coding regions. This is because the spectral power at N/3 will be determined by how the codons that make up the sequence are sampled. If the codons are sampled uniformly at random, as they would be in a noncoding segment of DNA, there is a high chance that the PCFs would not differ by a significant amount and the power at that frequency will be low. However, in a protein-coding sequence, the DNA sequence is made up of a string of codons which correspond to amino acids. Because the genetic code is degenerate (more than one codon map to a single amino acid) and samples from the amino acids rather than the codons, the codons are not sampled uniformly thus leading to differences in the PCFs. There is also empirical evidence for why this method works. In other words, over multiple studies this method has been able to discriminate coding vs. non-coding DNA segments. These are discussed in the next section. Experiments This method has been applied to sequence data from a number of organisms, details of which can be found in the references section. A few will be summarized here. Tiwari, who wrote the paper to first apply DFT to analyzing periodicity of DNA sequences, applied this method to S.cerevisiae and H.influenzuae. For S.cerevisiae, they were able to locate 413 out of 483 probable genes (ORFs). For H.influenzuae, they were able to locate 167 out of 194 identified genes. In both studies, they had a zero false-positive rate. Datta and Asif analyzed the algorithm's ability to identify coding regions of different lengths in chromosome III of C. elegans. Longer coding sequences are detected with higher probability. This seems to be a consequence of the Uncertainty principle (shorter-time signals spread out in frequency content) and the fact that fewer codons are provided in shorter sequences. Pros and Cons of the Property =Pros= * Requires no training data The method can be run on any DNA sequence, where as other methods such as BLAST, FASTA and Smith-Waterman require empirical data. * Independent of variations in base compositions This is because the total spectral power is :S[k]^2 = A[k]^2 + T[k]^2 + C[k]^2 + G[k]^2, and no one base contributes more than another. * Low false-positive rate * Robust to sequencing errors resulting in frameshifts This is due to the property that shifting a sequence does not change the magnitude of its Discrete Fourier Transform. :x[n-n_0] \\\\leftrightarrow X[k] e^{-j 2 \\\\pi k n_0 / N} :X[k] e^{-j 2 \\\\pi k n_0 / N} = X[k] =Cons= * Three-base periodicity found to be lacking in some genes * Outperformed by modern empirical and specialized gene prediction methods References Category:Genomics ","title":"3-Base Periodicity Property"},{"id":"50449472","text":"Antaeotricha elaeodes is a moth in the family Depressariidae.

It is the first Christian channel broadcasting live and recorded programming in Punjabi and Urdu within Europe. Glory TV is based in London, with recording of various programs taking place in key Christian communities in the United Kingdom such as Slough, Hounslow, Leicester, Wolverhampton, Southall, Glasgow and other areas with prominent British Asian churches. Programs are also recorded in and broadcast from Italy, France and the Netherlands, where Punjabi- and Urdu-speaking Christians are located. Religious programming and tour footage from Israel are also shown on a daily basis. Programming on occasion has also been aired in Gujarati and Nepali alongside English.  History  Pam Munir is an Indian-born Sikh British national who established the channel alongside her husband Sarfraz Munir, a Pakistani-born non- practicing Christian and singer, after they both converted to Christianity following a religious encounter which led to Pam leaving Sikhism and Sarfraz becoming a practising Christian. The couple worked from a rented studio in London alongside a small dedicated team to produce Christian content on evangelism and Biblical teaching whilst being completely voluntarily funded and creating live programming whilst editing prerecorded footage. They currently are based mainly within Slough. The Munirs have four children together. On 27 September 2014 Glory TV entertained the thoughts and opinions of inspirational Christian speakers, Howard and Renu Dwyer, the latter of the two gave a heartfelt testimony on her near death experience. In 2014 Glory TV went off the air for a short time due to not being able to provide its broadcasting fees due to lack of funding as the channel relies entirely upon viewer donations. Broadcasting As the first channel of its kind to offer Christian television in Punjabi and Urdu in the United Kingdom, Glory TV has mobilised the South Asian Church in Britain and has created grounds of expansion and greater communication for the minority community.

Despite incurring harassment and threats, and the objections of her son Robbie, Mildred remains determined to keep up her billboards. While Bill is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration, he finds the billboards an unfair attack on his character. Angered by her lack of respect for the chief's authority, Dixon threatens businessman Red Welby, who rented Mildred the billboards, and he arrests her friend and coworker, Denise, on trivial charges for drug possession. Mildred is visited by her abusive ex-husband Charlie, who reveals that, shortly before Angela's murder, he had turned down her request to come and live with him. Bill takes Mildred in for questioning after she drills a hole in her dentist's thumb when he threatens her. During the interview, Bill accidentally coughs up blood into Mildred's face. Mildred gets help and Bill is hospitalized, but he leaves the hospital against medical advice and spends an idyllic day with his wife Anne and their two daughters. He then dies by suicide to spare his family the pain of watching him die of cancer. He leaves suicide notes for several people, including one for Mildred, in which he explains that she was not a factor in his suicide and that he secretly paid to keep the billboards up for another month, amused at the guilt this will bring her and hoping that they will keep attention on the murder. Dixon reacts to the news of Bill's death by assaulting Welby and throwing him out of a window. This is witnessed by Abercrombie, the chief's replacement, who fires Dixon. Meanwhile, Mildred is threatened by a crop-haired stranger in her store. The billboards are destroyed by arson. Mildred retaliates by tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station, which she believes is unoccupied for the night. However, Dixon is there to read Bill's letter to him, which advises him to let go of hate and learn to love, as the only way to realize his wish to become a detective. Dixon escapes with Angela's case file but suffers severe burns. Mildred's acquaintance, James, witnesses the incident and extinguishes Dixon's burning clothes. He later provides Mildred with an alibi, claiming they were on a date at the time of the incident. Dixon is treated for his burns, and put in the same hospital room as Welby, to whom he apologizes. Jerome, who was employed by the advertising company to put Mildred's messages up on the billboards, gives her the spares that were made in case of mistakes. She uses them to restore the billboard messages. Discharged from the hospital, Dixon overhears the man who threatened Mildred bragging in a bar of having raped and killed a girl in the same manner as Mildred's daughter. He notes the Idaho license plate number of the man's vehicle, then provokes a fight by scratching the man's face, thereby getting a sample of his DNA. Meanwhile, Mildred goes on a date with James to thank him for the alibi. Charlie enters with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope, mocks James, and admits to burning the billboards while drunk. James senses that Mildred went out with him out of pity, and leaves angrily. Mildred considers attacking Charlie, but then tells him to treat Penelope well and leaves. Though commending him, Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample does not match that found on Angela's body, and that the man was overseas on military duty nine months prior. Dixon concludes that the man must be guilty of some other rape and murder, and joins Mildred on a trip to Idaho to kill him. On the way, Mildred confesses to Dixon that she set the police station on fire; he replies, \\"who the hell else would it have been?\\" They each express uncertainty about their mission, and agree to decide what to do along the way.

Production =Development= While traveling through the Southern United States in around 1998, Martin McDonagh came across a couple of accusatory billboards about an unsolved crime, which he described as \\"raging and painful and tragic\\" alleging the murder of a woman named Kathy Page by her husband Steve Page in Vidor, Texas. The billboards highlighted the incompetence of police work and deeply affected McDonagh; he said that the image \\"stayed in my mind [...] kept gnawing at me\\" and presumed that they were put up by the victim's mother. This incident, combined with his desire to create strong female characters, inspired him to write the story for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. McDonagh discussed the creative process, saying that it took him about ten years to \\"[decide] that it was a mother who had taken these things out. It all became fiction [...] based on a couple of actual billboards\\". =Casting and filming= The character of Mildred was written with Frances McDormand in mind, and likewise the character of Dixon was written specifically for Sam Rockwell. McDormand initially felt that she was older than the character as it was written, and suggested that Mildred instead be Angela's grandmother; McDonagh disagreed, feeling that it would change the story too much. McDormand's husband Joel Coen persuaded her to take the part regardless. McDormand took inspiration for her character from John Wayne; and Rockwell, wanting to make his character \\"the exact opposite\\" of Mildred, took inspiration for his character in part from Wayne's co-star in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Lee Marvin. Principal photography began on May 2, 2016 in Sylva, North Carolina, and ran for 33 days. Allison Outdoor Advertising of Sylva built the actual billboards, which were put in a pasture near Black Mountain, North Carolina because that location was better. Most of the time the billboards were covered because people in the area found them upsetting. David Penix of Arden, North Carolina bought the billboards and used the wood for a roof in Douglas Lake in Tennessee, though the messages are no longer in order. Town Pump Tavern in Black Mountain, which had appeared in The World Made Straight, was used as a set and was closed for three days during filming. A pool table and booths were added. The bar's actual sign appeared in the film. =Music= The musical score was written by Carter Burwell, who had also supplied the score for McDonagh's films In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths. As well as Burwell's score, the film features songs by ABBA, Joan Baez, The Felice Brothers, the Four Tops, The Left Banke, Monsters of Folk, and Townes Van Zandt.

The New York Times columnist Wesley Morris called McDonagh's portrayal of rural America a caricature: \\"a set of postcards from a Martian lured to America by a cable news ticker and by rumors of how easily flattered and provoked we are.\\" Tim Parks in The New Yorker praised the \\"magnificently photographed images\\", but wrote that the plot contained \\"a thousand cheap coincidences\\". He concluded that the film is \\"empty of emotional intelligence\\" and \\"devoid of any remotely honest observation of the society it purports to serve.\\" In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote \\"[McDonagh's] jokes can be uninterestingly glib with tiny, bloodless pricks that are less about challenging the audience than about obscuring the material's clich√©s and overriding theatricality.\\" The film was also controversial for its handling of racial themes, particularly surrounding the redemptive arc of Officer Dixon. In The Daily Beast, blogger Ira Madison III called the treatment of Rockwell's character \\"altogether offensive...McDonagh's attempts to script the black experience in America are often fumbling and backward and full of outdated tropes.\\" Alyssa Rosenberg noted in The Washington Post that \\"[Dixon's] redemption doesn't merely defang his previous venomous bigotry; it softens Mildred's character development.\\" =Accolades= At the 75th Golden Globe Awards, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri won for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama, Best Actress ‚Äì Drama (McDormand), Best Supporting Actor (Rockwell), and Best Screenplay, and was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Score.

Impact On February 15, 2018, Justice4Grenfell, an advocacy group created in response to the Grenfell Tower fire, hired three vans with electronic screens in a protest against perceived inaction in response to the fire.

Drawing by Vicens Roig. The Castell del Patriarca (English for: Patriarch's castle) was a castle that was in the city of Tarragona (Spain). Located from the street Mercer√≠a covered up much of the streets of Cocas, de San Lorenzo and the Nueva del Patriarca descent. Its construction was begun in the 12th century by Archbishop Bernat Tort, who built up the height of the second floor, and was completed by the Archbishop Bernat de Olivella in the 13th century. The result was a manor fortress in which lived all the prelates of the Tarraconense headquarter until the early 19th century, when Archbishop Romuald Mon moved to the new palace during his prelature. Here was prisoner the French king Francis I in the 16th century. Later, during the period of the Peninsular War, and due to the large increase in troops, the Castle del Patriarca (and also the Castle de Pilat) was intended to serve as accommodation for the Napoleonic French troops. Possibly it was the circumstance that led to it was dynamited on 19 August 1813 to evacuate the city the Frenchs. Historians tell that the French general Bartoletti put so much interest in disappear it, in the words of the Canon Huy√†, the detonations of the mines made so much din \\"that until the pavement where we were made shake; We saw the flames of fire and that's when we realized that this sturdy monument had ceased to exist\\". Of the castle remained only a pile of rubble, of which it have record in the drawing by Vicens Roig. The building was completed fully demolished in 1825 when the site was allocated to the construction of private houses. When Francis I of France was prisoner in The Castell del Patriarca had several towers distributed in different corners of the building. Was in one of these towers where remained for a few days the French king Francis I, when he was taken prisoner by the Spaniards Tercios in the famous battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525. The squadron that moved to the king to Valencia by sea it forced to take refuge in the harbor of Tarragona due to a large weather until, arriving calm, they could continue their journey. In this regard the presence of the French king the chronicler Blanch account, among other things, an event that was about to cause a conflict. On the third day of the arrival of the king -was Sunday-, he was transferred to the cathedral to hear Mass, and like the Main Mass was over the Archbishop Pedro Cardona ordered that other it officiate. At the end, perhaps because they did not see too much security where he was kept, they moved to other tower of the castle. At nightfall the soldiers who guarded unhappy because it owed them three pays, they asked collects it the Viceroy who commanded them, and they did so violently that set fire and burned the doors. He promised to pay them the next day and the soldiers accepted in spite of receiving only part of the money. Moreover, it was suspected that this kind of revolt organized some supporters of the French king in order to release it.

Panama has had a reputation for tax avoidance since the early 20th century, and Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives. Panama's offshore sector is intimately tied to the Panama canal, which has made it a gateway and entrep√¥t for international trade. There are strong similarities between Panama and other leading tax havens like Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai. On paper at least, Panama has the largest shipping fleet in the world, greater than those of the US and China combined, according to the Tax Justice Network. Background (1910s‚Äì1970s) Construction work on the Gaillard Cut of the Panama Canal, 1907 A 2014 investigation by journalist Ken Silverstein published in Vice Magazine explains how Panama came into being, with US help: > In 1903, the administration of Theodore Roosevelt created the country after > bullying Colombia to hand over what was then the province of Panama. > Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them J. P. > Morgan & Co., which was appointed as the country's official \\"fiscal agent\\". An operation approved by the Roosevelt administration sought to foment armed rebellion, forcing Panama away from a politically fragile Colombia. Roosevelt achieved this goal with the help of William Nelson Cromwell, a well-connected US Republican lawyer and also legal counsel for JP Morgan's railroad interests. The administration's key objective was allegedly to install a pro- US Panamanian government that would secure US rights over the Panama Canal. The Hay‚ÄìBunau-Varilla Treaty resulted, establishing permanent U.S. rights to a Panama Canal Zone several miles wide, across the neck of the isthmus. Panama became independent from Colombia the same month, and the Panama Canal opened in 1914. According to a 2013 academic study published by the Norwegian Center for Taxation, Panama's reputation as a tax haven began in the year 1919, when it began registering foreign ships in order to help Standard Oil avoid US taxes and regulations; other US ship owners followed, some seeking to avoid the higher wages and better working conditions imposed by US legislation such as the Seaman's Act and safety standards for sea vessels. Also, during the Prohibition era, US passenger ships were allowed to serve alcohol to their customers without breaking the law if they had Panamanian registration. Within a few years, Panama extended its minimalist approach to taxation, regulation and financial disclosure requirements to the world of offshore finance. According to the study, \\"Wall Street interests helped Panama introduce lax company incorporation laws, which let anyone start tax-free, anonymous corporations, with few questions asked\\". Background (1970s‚Äìpresent) For decades, offshore finance had a relatively modest profile in Panama, but it took off in the 1970s as world oil prices surged. During this time, the Republic of Panama passed legislation \\"entrenching corporate and individual financial secrecy\\". By 1982, partly attracted by business opportunities deriving from the Panama Canal and its free trade zone, more than 100 international banks had offices in Panama City. According to Investopedia: \\"Panama's offshore jurisdiction offers a wide array of excellent financial services, including offshore banking, the incorporation of offshore companies, registration of ships and the formation of Panama trusts and foundations.\\" In Panama, no taxes are imposed on offshore companies which engage in business solely outside of the jurisdiction; therefore, the companies which are incorporated in the Republic of Panama and the owners of these companies are exempt from corporate taxes, withholding taxes, capital gains tax, local taxes, estate taxes and inheritance tax. However, businesses within Panama itself are permitted to conduct business there so long as the company pays its local taxes. Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years by the State Department of the United States and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives due to the legislation which regulates the country's offshore jurisdiction and financial services.Panama as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives:  Panama has over 350,000 International Business Companies (IBCs) registered, the third largest number in the world after Hong Kong and the Virgin Islands. Alongside incorporation of IBCs, Panama is active in forming tax-evading foundations and trusts, insurance, and boat and shipping registration, according to the Tax Justice Network. =Financial privacy= Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the Panama Papers leak on April 15, 2016 An extensive amount of legislation currently exists in the Republic of Panama to protect corporate and financial privacy. However, organisations such as the Tax Justice Network and other advocacy groups and non-governmental organisations state that the main intention of these laws is financial secrecy, as opposed to privacy. The names of shareholders of Panamanian corporations, trusts and foundations are still not required by law to be publicly registered. Panama has no exchange controls: this means that for individual clients of Panama's offshore banking, as well as for offshore business entities incorporated in Panama, there are no limits or reporting requirements on money transfers into or out of the country. Panama also has very strict banking secrecy laws: for example, it is forbidden for Panamanian banks to share any information about offshore bank accounts or account holders, except under special circumstances instigated by the Panamanian authorities. Such regulation has made it difficult to investigate the true extent of the Panama Papers leak, as severe criminal penalties are enacted to individuals who breach confidentiality. Despite this, Panama does not appear on the Tax Justice Network's top ten list for financial secrecy, with Alex Cobham of Tax Justice Network saying \\"There is a double standard: many developed countries host or support jurisdictions where there is an absence of financial transparency\\". Accusations Mossack Fonseca headquarters. Pascal Saint Amans, Director of the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration in the OECD said: \\"From the standpoint of reputation, Panama is still the only place where people still believe they can hide their money.\\" Writing for VICE News, Ken Silverstein explained the Mossack Fonseca history in the region: \\"These laws attracted a long line of 'dirtbags' and dictators who used Panama to hide their stolen loot, including Ferdinand Marcos, 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, and Augusto Pinochet. When Manuel Noriega, commander of the Panama Defence Forces, took power in Panama in 1983, Silverstein said, Noriega essentially nationalised the money-laundering business; he partnered with the Medellin drug cartel and gave it free rein to operate in the country.\\" In the United Kingdom, Private Eye used data collected from the Land Registry to create \\"an easily searchable online map ... of properties in England and Wales owned by offshore companies. It reveals for the first time the extent of the British property interests held by companies based in tax havens.\\" Most of these properties are tax avoidance vehicles and in some cases also to conceal wealth of dubious origin.\\" A 2003 examination of tax havens by Jeffrey Robinson quotes a US Customs official as saying: > [Panama] is filled with dishonest lawyers, dishonest bankers, dishonest > company formation agents and dishonest companies registered there by those > dishonest lawyers so that they can deposit dirty money into their dishonest > banks. The Free Trade Zone is the black hole through which Panama has become > one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world. =Tax Justice Network= The advocacy group the Tax Justice Network has described Panama as \\"the recipient of drugs money from Latin America, plus ample other sources of dirty money from the US and elsewhere\\". It said \\"now is a good moment to draw attention to how Panama developed as a secrecy jurisdiction and how it continues to provide full service ‚Äì wash, rinse and dry ‚Äì to crooks and money launderers from around the world.\\" Response Ram√≥n Fonseca Mora, the co-founder of Mossack Fonseca, told the New York Times: \\"I assure you there is more dirty money in New York, Miami and London than there is in Panama\\". The United States is an alleged tax haven despite the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. The US has refused the Common Reporting Standard set up by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This means the US receives tax and asset information for American assets and income abroad, but does not share information about what happens in the United States with other countries; in other words, the US has become attractive as a tax haven.

Animal welfare and rights in Japan is about the laws concerning the treatment of animals in Japan. Japan has had a national animal welfare law since 1973, but its protections for animals are weak by international standards. Animal activism in Japan is focused on the welfare of companion animals.  History  Buddhism was officially introduced to Japan in the 6th century CE. A central teaching of Buddhism is ahimsa, or nonviolence towards all living things, and its proscriptions against killing animals and encouragement of vegetarianism were highly influential in several periods of Japanese history. In 675, Emperor Tenmu banned the consumption of meat (with exceptions for fish and wild animals) due to his devout Buddhism, though the ban seems not to have been well-observed. Meat was reintroduced when Christian missionaries from Portugal and Netherlands arrived in Japan (beginning in the 16th century with their omnivorous diets. The ban on eating meat was reinstated in 1687 under the Buddhist Tokugawa shogunate. Killing animals was made illegal as well, though a black market in hunted meat emerged. The taboo against eating meat once again disappeared when Emperor Meiji began eating meat publicly at dinners with Westerners in 1872. The removal of the ban encountered resistance and in one notable response, ten monks attempted to break into the Imperial Palace. The monks asserted that due to foreign influence, large numbers of Japanese had begun eating meat and that this was \\"destroying the soul of the Japanese people.\\" Several of the monks were killed during the break-in attempt, and the remainder were arrested. The consumption of animal products has since become the norm in Japan, and has increased dramatically since the introduction of intensive animal farming in the 1950s.  Legislation  Japan's main animal welfare law is the 1973 Act on Welfare and Management of Animals. The law makes it a crime to kill, injure, or inflict cruelty on animals without due cause, and creates a duty of care in owners and keepers of animals to maintain their health and safety and raise them in a manner according to their species and behavior. The law lists cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, domestic rabbits, chickens, domestic pigeons and domestic ducks, or other animals which have an owner and are mammals, birds or reptiles as protected, meaning that fish are not protected. The penalty for killing or injuring an animal in this category is a fine or imprisonment up to one year; abandonment and cruelty by neglect are punishable with fines. Farm animals besides fish are protected by the anti- cruelty and duty of care provisions. Slaughter is to minimize pain and distress (though appropriate methods are not specified and stunning is not required). There is no legislation specifically addressing farm animals, and livestock are excluded from the law's Regulations on Animal Handling Businesses. The anti-cruelty and duty of care provisions also apply to animals in research (except fish). In addition, the law stipulates that alternative methods and the reduction of the number of animals used be considered, and methods that minimize pain and distress be used as much as possible. Animals used in experiments should be killed in such a way that minimizes pain and distress. The law was amended in 2005 to create new basic guidelines for experimentation based on the Three Rs (refine, replace, reduce) for animal testing; the law still relies heavily on self-regulation, however. In 2012, the law was amended to impose stricter regulations on sellers of dogs and cats; create measures for animal welfare during disaster; more clearly define animal abuse; and expand duty of care, stating that \\"every person shall maintain the environment and health of animals, shall feed and water animals properly by taking into account their natural habits and giving consideration to the symbiosis between humans and animals.\\" In 2014, Japan received a D out of possible grades A, B, C, D, E, F, G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index.  Animal issues  = Animals used for food =  Animal agriculture  Veal crates, gestation crates, and battery cages are legal in Japan, as is cutting off tails, beaks, and fangs without anesthesia. Cow production increased from 142,000 tons in 1960 to a peak of 602,000 in 1994, down to 490,000 tons in 2015. Poultry consumption rose from 74,000 tons to 1.375 million in 2015, an increase of nearly twenty-fold. In 2015 Japan had 1.185 million farmed cattle, and 17.15 million farmed swine. Over 823 million farm animals were slaughtered in Japan in 2010.  Animal product consumption  Between the 1960s and 2000, Japanese total meat consumption increased fivefold. Japan is the second-largest fish and seafood importer in the world, and the largest in Asia. However per capita consumption of fish and seafood declined from 40 kg in 2007 to 33 kg in 2012, partly due to a rise in meat and dairy consumption. In a 2014 survey by the Japanese organization Animal Rights Center, 4.7% of respondents were vegetarians (including vegans). = Animal testing = A 2009 survey found a total of 11,337,334 animals being maintained in Japanese laboratories. Cruelty Free International estimates that Japan ranks second in the world (behind the United States) in the number of animals used in experiments. Testing cosmetics on animals is legal in Japan; in fact, law requires that \\"quasi-drugs\\" like skin-lightening products, suntan lotion, and hair growth tonics be tested on animals when new ingredients are added. Shiseido, Japan's largest cosmetics manufacturer, announced in 2013 that it would stop testing cosmetics on animals. In 2015, Humane Society International began leading a Be Cruelty-Free campaign to pressure the National Diet to ban testing cosmetics on animals. = Taiji dolphin drive hunt = The Taiji dolphin drive hunt is a dolphin drive hunt that takes place in Taiji, Wakayama in Japan every year from September to March. The hunting is done by a select group of fishermen.Paul Kenyon (2004), reporter for the BBC. BBC's dining with the dolphin hunters, retrieved on June 21, 2008. When a pod of dolphins has been spotted, fishing boats move into position. One end of a steel pipe is lowered into the water, and the fisherman aboard the boats strike the pipe with mallets.Kjeld Duits (2005), Japan correspondent for Environmental News Service (ENS). Activists Worldwide Protest Japan's Dolphin Slaughter, ENS article retrieved on June 21, 2008. This is done at strategic points around the pod, in an effort to herd them toward land. The clamor disrupts the dolphin's sonar throwing off their navigation and herds them towards the bay which leads to a sheltered cove. There, the fishermen quickly close off the area with nets to prevent the dolphin's escape. As the dolphins are initially quite agitated, they are left to calm down over night. The following day, fishermen enter the bay in small boats, and the dolphins are caught one at a time and killed. The primary method of dispatch was for a long time to cut the dolphin's throat, severing blood vessels, and death was due to exsanguination. The government banned this method and now the officially sanctioned method requires that a metal pin be driven into the cervical region (\\"neck\\") of the dolphin, severing its brainstem, which causes it to die within seconds, according to a memo from Senzo Uchida, the executive secretary of the Japan Cetacean Conference on Zoological Gardens and Aquariums. According to an academic paper published in 2013 in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science titled A Veterinary and Behavioral Analysis of Dolphin Killing Methods Currently Used in the 'Drive Hunt' in Taiji, Japan, those killing methods involving driving a rod into the spine and using a pin to stop bleeding that is used by the Taiji Japanese creates such terror and pain that it would be illegal to kill cows in Japan in this manner. Several veterinarians and behavioral scientists evaluated the current Taiji Japanese killing method and concluded that \\"This killing method‚Ä¶.would not be tolerated or permitted in any regulated slaughterhouse process in the developed world.\\"  Organizations  According to its website, the Animal Rights Center (founded 1987) works on issues involving the welfare of stray animals, and opposes animal testing, fur farming, and meat-eating through demonstrations, lectures, and the distribution of educational material. The Japanese Animal Welfare Society (JAWS) UK can be traced to an organization founded in Tokyo in 1945 by British expatriates. Its original aim was to improve the welfare of dogs used for experiments, whose were kept in poor conditions and used in unregulated, in vivo tests. Officially founded in the UK, JAWS UK continued to assist efforts to help these dogs and other animals, eventually helping to found a JAWS based in Japan. Its current activities include funding vital animal welfare equipment such as veterinary drugs and humane cat traps, providing general funds for local animal welfare groups, and promoting the Five Freedoms for Japanese animals. According to Honjo (2014), Japanese animal welfare organizations focus on companion animals, paying little attention to farmed animals.

It is based in the Paul Webley wing of the Senate House in Bloomsbury, London, United Kingdom. The SOAS School of Law has an emphasis on the legal systems of Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The School of Law has over 400 students. It offers programmes at the LLB, LLM and MPhil/PhD level. International students have been the majority at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level for many years. It publishes a number of journals, including the Journal of African Law, the Journal of Comparative Law and the Yearbook of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law. Along with the International Environmental Law Research Centre (IELRC), it produces the Law, Environment and Development Journal (LEAD Journal). An independent student law journal is also published by undergraduate and graduate students, the SOAS Law Journal, and it publishes articles from faculty, students and alumni. Notable alumni of the school of law include David Lammy MP, former President of Ghana John Atta Mills, Supreme Court justices from Nigeria and Sri Lanka, and Iranian human rights activist Ghoncheh Ghavami. History The SOAS School of Law was established in 1947 with Vesey-Fitzgerald as its first head, and as such is one of the 20 oldest law schools in England. Initially, the School of Law only hosted post-graduate students. In 1975, under the leadership of Antony Nicholas Allott, the school developed a comparative undergraduate LLB which continues to the present. SOAS School of Law Student Handbook: 2009 In 2012, the Head of the Law School, Mashood Baderin, was appointed as Special Independent Expert to Sudan by the United Nations Human Rights Council. In 2013, Paul Kohler assumed the role as Head of the SOAS School of Law following the retirement of Baderin. Academics The SOAS School of Law Bachelor of Laws (LLB) programme is recognised as a Qualifying Law Degree by the Law Society of England and Wales and the Bar Standards Board for the purposes of completing legal training. As such, the SOAS LLB satisfies all professional requirements for the Common Professional Examination. Although many modules at SOAS embody a substantial element of English common law, all modules are taught as far as possible in a comparative or international manner with an emphasis in the way in which law functions in society. Thus, law studies at SOAS are broad and comparative in their orientation. All students study a significant amount of non-English law, start in the first year of the LLB course, where 'Legal Systems of Asia and Africa' is compulsory. Specialised modules in the laws and legal systems of particular countries and regions is also encouraged and faculty experts conduct modules in these subjects every year. Several combination BA degrees also allow students to combine law courses with another faculty, including history and politics. The SOAS School of Law also has a Master of Laws (LLM) which provides many advanced courses on comparative, international and transnational commercial law- all focused on Asian and African legal issues. The SOAS School of Law also offers a PhD programme. In addition to academic programmes, SOAS School of Law students also have access to several Pro Bono law clinics. These Pro Bono law clinics offer students the opportunity to work alongside practising lawyers on actual cases involving human rights and civil rights which are taken on free of charge to the clients. =Research= The SOAS School of Law has expertise in the laws of Asian and African countries, human rights, transnational commercial law, environmental law, and comparative law. It is home to the following research centres: * Centre for East Asian Laws (CEAL) * Centre for Law and Conflict * Centre for Ethnic Minority Studies (CEMS) * Centre for Islamic and Middle Eastern Law (CIMEL). Faculty members routinely contribute to journals and publish volumes of leading research annually. The school has close ties with the internationally renowned Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, which is also part of the federal University of London. =Publications= The SOAS School of Law and faculty members are involved in the publication of the following legal research journals: * Journal of African Law, * Journal of Comparative Law, * Law Reports of the Commonwealth,https://store.lexisnexis.co.uk/categories/products/law-reports- of-the-commonwealth-set-skuuksku9780406998422LRCMW29858/details * Yearbook of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law, * Law, Environment and Development Journal (LEAD Journal), * SOAS Law Journal (Co-founded by five SOAS law students, it is a student-led and edited journal featuring submissions by students, alumni and faculty.) =Rankings= The SOAS School of Law was ranked 46th out of all British law schools by The Guardian League Table in 2020. The QS World University Rankings placed SOAS in the 151-200 bracket in 2020 for law. SOAS Law Society The SOAS Law Society promotes opportunities to learn about the study of law and career options to student members at SOAS. The Law Society hosts meetings, intercollegiate exchanges, mooting tournaments and other educational events. Although there was formerly a separate SOAS Bar Society that conducted bar-related programming and organised moot teams and tournaments, it merged with the Law Society in 2013. Past moot teams fielded by the SOAS Law Society or SOAS Bar Society have participated in the annual English Law Students Association (ELSA) Moot Tournament and the prestigious London Universities Mooting Shield, which was founded by SOAS Law School alumnus, barrister and present New York attorney Daniel Jackson. Amal Clooney was a special lecturer on international criminal law. Teaching Faculty at the SOAS School of Law are routinely rated highly on national student satisfaction surveys, with the satisfaction rate reaching 91% in 2015.

Nuclear organization refers to the spatial distribution of chromatin within a cell nucleus. There are many different levels and scales of nuclear organisation. At the smallest scale, DNA is packaged into units called nucleosomes. The quantity and organisation of these nucleosomes can affect the accessibility of local chromatin. This has a knock-on effect on the expression of nearby genes, additionally determining whether or not they can be regulated by transcription factors. At slightly larger scales, DNA looping can physically bring together DNA elements that would otherwise be separated by large distances. These interactions allow regulatory signals to cross over large genomic distances‚Äîfor example, from enhancers to promoters. In contrast, on a large scale, the arrangement of chromosomes can determine their properties. Chromosomes are organised into two compartments labelled A (\\"active\\") and B (\\"inactive\\"), each with distinct properties. Moreover, entire chromosomes segregate into distinct regions called chromosome territories. Importance Each human cell contains around two metres of DNA, which must be tightly folded to fit inside the cell nucleus. However, in order for the cell to function, proteins must be able to access the sequence information contained within the DNA, in spite of its tightly-packed nature. Hence, the cell has a number of mechanisms in place to control how DNA is organized. Moreover, nuclear organization can play a role in establishing cell identity. Cells within an organism have near identical nucleic acid sequences, but often exhibit different phenotypes. One way in which this individuality occurs is through changes in genome architecture, which can alter the expression of different sets of genes. These alterations can have a downstream effect on cellular functions such as cell cycle facilitation, DNA replication, nuclear transport, and alteration of nuclear structure. Controlled changes in nuclear organization are essential for proper cellular function. History and methodology The organization of chromosomes into distinct regions within the nucleus was first proposed in 1885 by Carl Rabl. Later in 1909, with the help of the microscopy technology at the time, Theodor Boveri coined the termed chromosome territories after observing that chromosomes occupy individually distinct nuclear regions. Since then, mapping genome architecture has become a major topic of interest. Over the last ten years, rapid methodological developments have greatly advanced understanding in this field. Large-scale DNA organization can be assessed with DNA imaging using fluorescent tags, such as DNA Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and specialized microscopes. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing technologies such as Chromosome Conformation Capture-based methods can measure how often DNA regions are in close proximity. At the same time, progress in genome-editing techniques (such as CRISPR/Cas9, ZFNs, and TALENs) have made it easier to test the organizational function of specific DNA regions and proteins. Architectural proteins Architectural proteins regulate chromatin structure by establishing physical interactions between DNA elements. These proteins tend to be highly conserved across a majority of eukaryotic species. In mammals, key architectural proteins include: * Histones: DNA is wrapped around histones to form nucleosomes, which are basic units of chromatin structure. Each nucleosome consists of 8 histone protein subunits, around which roughly 147 DNA base pairs are wrapped in 1.67 left-handed turns. Altogether, nucleosomes pack approximately 2 meters of double stranded DNA into a 10 ¬µm diameter nucleus. The concentration and specific composition of histones used can determine local chromatin structure. For example, euchromatin is a form of chromatin with low nucleosome concentration - here, the DNA is exposed, promoting interactions with gene expression, replication, and organizational machinery. In contrast, heterochromatin has high nucleosome concentration and is associated with repression of gene expression and replication, as the necessary proteins cannot interact with the DNA. * Chromatin remodeling enzymes: These enzymes are responsible for promoting euchromatin or heterochromatin formation by a number of processes, particularly modifying histone tails or physically moving the nucleosomes. This in turn, helps regulate gene expression, replication, and how the chromatin interacts with architectural factors.Phillips, T. & Shaw, K. (2008) Chromatin Remodeling in Eukaryotes. Nature Education 1(1):209 The list of chromatin remodeling enzymes is extensive and many have specific roles within the nucleus. For example, in 2016 Wiechens et al. recently identified two human enzymes, SNF2H and SNF2L, that are active in regulating CTCF binding and therefore affect genome organization and transcription of many genes. * CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), or 11-zinc finger protein, is considered the most prominent player in linking genome organization with gene expression. CTCF interacts with specific DNA sequences and a variety of other architectural proteins, chiefly cohesin \\\\- these behaviours allow it to mediate DNA looping, thus acting as transcriptional repressor, activator, and insulator. Furthermore, CTCF is often found at self-interacting domain boundaries, and can anchor the chromatin to the nuclear lamina. CTCF is also involved in V(D)J recombination. * Cohesin: The cohesin complex was initially discovered as a key player in mitosis, binding sister chromatids together to ensure proper segregation. However, cohesin has since been linked to many more functions within the cell. It has been found to help facilitate DNA repair and recombination, meiotic chromosome pairing and orientation, chromosome condensation, DNA replication, gene expression, and genome architecture. Cohesin is a heterodimer composed of the proteins SMC1 and SMC3 in combination with the SCC1 and SCC3 proteins. The entire complex is loaded onto DNA by the NIPBL-MAU2 complex in a ring-like fashion. Levels of nuclear organisation =Linear DNA and chromosome basics= The hierarchical structure through which DNA is packaged into chromosomes. The first level of genome organization concerns how DNA is arranged linearly, and how it is packaged into chromosomes. DNA is composed of two antiparallel strands of nucleic acids, with two bound and opposing nucleic acids referred to as DNA base pairs. In order for DNA to pack inside the tiny cell nucleus, each strand is wrapped around histones, forming nucleosome structures. These nucleosome pack together to form chromosomes. Depending on the eukaryote, there are multiple independent chromosomes of varying sizes within each nucleus ‚Äì for example, humans have 46 while giraffes have 30.Huang L, Nesterenko A, Nie W, Wang J, Su W, Graphodatsky AS, Yang F: Karyotypic evolution of giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) revealed by cross-species chromosome painting with Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and human (Homo sapiens) paints. Cytogenet Genome Res. 2008, 122: 132‚Äì138. Within regions of the chromosome, the order of the DNA base pairs makes up specific elements for gene expression and DNA replication. Some of the more common elements include protein coding genes (containing exons and introns), noncoding DNA, enhancers, promoters, operators, origins of replication, telomeres, and centromeres. As of yet, there is not much evidence towards the importance of specific order of these elements along or between individual chromosomes. For example, the distance between an enhancer and a promoter, interacting elements that form a basis of gene expression, can range from a few hundred base pairs to hundreds of kb away. As well, individual enhancers can interact with a number of different promoters and the same is true for a single promoter interacting with multiple different enhancers. However, on a larger scale, chromosomes are heterogeneous in the context of euchromatin and heterochromatin composition. As well, there is evidence of gene rich and poor regions and various domains associated with cell differentiation, active or repressed gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA recombination and repair. All of these help determine chromosome territories. =DNA looping= A cartoon representing an enhancer interacting with genes through DNA looping. DNA looping is the first level of nuclear organization that involves chromosomal folding. In a DNA looping event, chromatin forms physical loops, bringing DNA regions into close contact. Thus, even regions that are far apart along the linear chromosome can be brought together in three-dimensional space. The process is facilitated by a number of factors including architectural proteins (primarily CTCF and Cohesin), transcription factors, co-activators, and ncRNAs. Importantly, DNA looping can be used to regulate gene expression ‚Äì looping events can repress or activate genes, depending on the elements involved. Approximately 50% of human genes are believed to be involved in long range chromatin interactions through the process of DNA looping. Looping was first observed by Walther Flemming in 1878 when he was studying amphibian oocytes. It was not until the late 20th century when DNA looping was correlated with gene expression. For example, in 1990, Mandal and colleagues showed the importance of DNA looping in repressing the galactose and lactose operons in E coli. In the presence of galactose or lactose, repressor proteins form protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to loop the DNA. This in turn connects the gene promoters with upstream and downstream operators, effectively repressing gene expression by blocking transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly at the promoter and therefore preventing transcription initiation. In gene activation, DNA looping typically brings together distal gene promoters and enhancers. Enhancers can recruit a large complex of proteins, such as the mediator complex, PIC, and other cell specific transcription factors, involved in initiating the transcription of a gene. =Chromosomal domains= Self- interacting domains Self-interacting (or self-associating) domains are found in many organisms ‚Äì in bacteria, they are referred to as Chromosomal Interacting Domains (CIDs), whereas in mammalian cells, they are called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). Self-interacting domains can range from the 1‚Äì2 mb scale in larger organisms to 10s of kb in single celled organisms. What characterizes a self-interacting domain is a set of common features. The first is that self-interacting domains have a higher of ratio of chromosomal contacts within the domain than outside it. They are formed through the help of architectural proteins and contain within them many chromatin loops. This characteristic was discovered using Hi-C techniques. Second, self-interacting domains correlate with regulation of gene expression. There specific domains that are associated with active transcription and other domains that repress transcription. What distinguishes whether a domain takes a particular form is dependent on which associated genes need to be active/inactive during particular phase of growth, cell cycle stage, or within a specific cell type. Cellular differentiation is determined by particular sets of genes being on or off, corresponding with the unique makeup of an individual cell's self-interacting domains. Lastly, the outside boundaries of these domains contain a higher frequency of architectural protein binding sites, regions and epigenetic marks correlated to active transcription, housekeeping genes, and short interspaced nuclear elements (SINEs). An example of a subset of self-interacting domains is active chromatin hubs (ACHs). These hubs were discovered during observation of activated alpha- and beta-globin loci. ACHs are formed through extensive DNA looping to form a \\"hub\\" of regulatory elements in order to coordinate the expression of a subset of genes. Lamina-associating domains and nucleolar-associating domains Lamina-associating domains (LADs) and nucleolar-associating domains (NADs) are regions of the chromosome that interact with the nuclear lamina and nucleolus, respectively. Making up approximately 40% of the genome, LADs consist mostly of gene poor regions and span between 40kb to 30Mb in size. There are two known types of LADs: constitutive LADs (cLADs) and facultative LADs (fLADs). cLADs are A-T rich heterochromatin regions that remain on lamina and are seen across many types of cells and species. There is evidence that these regions are important to the structural formation of interphase chromosome. On the other hand, fLADs have varying lamina interactions and contain genes that are either activated or repressed between individual cells indicating cell-type specificity. The boundaries of LADs, like self-interacting domains, are enriched in transcriptional elements and architectural protein binding sites. NADs, which constitutes 4% of the genome, share nearly all of the same physical characteristics as LADs. In fact, DNA analysis of these two types of domains have shown that many sequences overlap, indicating that certain regions may switch between lamina-binding and nucleolus-binding. NADs are associated with nucleolus function. The nucleolus is the largest sub-organelle within the nucleus and is the principal site for rRNA transcription. It also acts in signal recognition particle biosynthesis, protein sequestration, and viral replication. The nucleolus forms around rDNA genes from different chromosomes. However, only a subset of rDNA genes is transcribed at a time and do so by looping into the interior of the nucleolus. The rest of the genes lay on the periphery of the sub-nuclear organelle in silenced heterochromatin state. =A/B compartments= A/B compartments were first discovered in early Hi-C studies. Researchers noticed that the whole genome could be split into two spatial compartments, labelled \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", where regions in compartment A tend to interact preferentially with A compartment-associated regions than B compartment-associated ones. Similarly, regions in compartment B tend to associate with other B compartment-associated regions. A/B compartment- associated regions are on the multi-Mb scale and correlate with either open and expression-active chromatin (\\"A\\" compartments) or closed and expression- inactive chromatin (\\"B\\" compartments). A compartments tend to be gene-rich, have high GC-content, contain histone markers for active transcription, and usually displace the interior of the nucleus. As well, they are typically made up of self-interacting domains and contain early replication origins. B compartments, on the other hand, tend to be gene-poor, compact, contain histone markers for gene silencing, and lie on the nuclear periphery. They consist mostly of LADs and contain late replication origins. In addition, higher resolution Hi-C coupled with machine learning methods has revealed that A/B compartments can be refined into subcompartments. The fact that compartments self-interact is consistent with the idea that the nucleus localizes proteins and other factors such as long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in regions suited for their individual roles. An example of this is the presence of multiple transcription factories throughout the nuclear interior. These factories are associated with elevated levels of transcription due to the high concentration of transcription factors (such as transcription protein machinery, active genes, regulatory elements, and nascent RNA). Around 95% of active genes are transcribed within transcription factories. Each factory can transcribe multiple genes ‚Äì these genes need not have similar product functions, nor do they need to lie on the same chromosome. Finally, the co- localization of genes within transcription factories is known to depend on cell type. =Chromosome territories= The 23 human chromosome territories during prometaphase in fibroblast cells The last level of organization concerns the distinct positioning of individual chromosomes within the nucleus. The region occupied by a chromosome is called a chromosome territory (CT). Among eukaryotes, CTs have several common properties. First, although chromosomal locations are not the same across cells within a population, there is some preference among individual chromosomes for particular regions. For example, large, gene-poor chromosomes are commonly located on the periphery near the nuclear lamina while smaller, gene-rich chromosomes group closer to the center of the nucleus. Second, individual chromosome preference is variable among different cell types. For example, the X-chromosome has shown to localize to the periphery more often in liver cells than in kidney cells. Another conserved property of chromosome territories is that homologous chromosomes tend to be far apart from one another during cell interphase. The final characteristic is that the position of individual chromosomes during each cell cycle stays relatively the same until the start of mitosis. The mechanisms and reasons behind chromosome territory characteristics is still unknown and further experimentation is needed.

The rigid, pungent and glabrous phyllodes are patent to slightly reflexed and straight to slightly recurved with a tetragonous or sometimes trigonous cross-section. The phyllodes are in length and around wide with four main 4-nerves. It blooms from July to September and produces yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences are found singly or in pairs in the axils and have spherical slightly obloid shaped flower-heads containing 16 to 20 cream to pale yellow coloured flower. Following flowering glabrous, firmly chartaceous, dark brown seed pods form that resemble a string of beads with a length of up to and a width of . The shiny dark brown seeds inside have a widely oblong-elliptic shape with a length of around and a conical terminal aril. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Bruce Maslin in 1976 as a part of the work Studies in the genus Acacia (Mimosaceae) - Miscellaneous new phyllodinous species as published in the journal Nuytsia. It was reclassified as Racosperma simulans by Leslie Pedley on 2003 then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. Distribution It is native to a small area in the Great Southern and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia from around Jerramungup in the west to Ravensthorpe in the east where it typically is found growing in sandy soils over quartzite. The range is limited to the Fitzgerald River National Park where it forms part of scrubland or heathland communities that are dominated by Eucalyptus tetraptera.

It was founded in 1221, but now serves as a military hospital, and is not accessible to the public. History and description The site by 1219 housed a convent of benedictine order monks. Because the site had luxuriant growth of vegetation, the site gained the suffix of de Verdara. In 1436, the monastery was granted to the Canons Regular of the Lateran. They commissioned from Lorenzo da Bologna and Giuliano da Porlezza a refurbishment of the monastery and design of the present church building. By 1566, the monastery had become an abbey, and over the next centuries had accumulated a well known library, with collections from Pietro Montagnana, Marco Mantova Bonavides, and Ludovico Antonio Muratori. The order of canons was suppressed in 1784 by the Republic of Venice, and the monastery briefly passed to the Jesuit order. The library was dispersed to the Civic Museum of Padua and the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana. Overtime, the monastery and church were used for different functions including brefotrofio (orphanage for abandoned babies) and barracks; the church was deconsecrated by 1866. Inside the church were buried Giovanni Calfurnio, Giovanni da Cavino, Luca Ferrari, and Domenico Senno. The large cloister of the monastery was designed circa 1492 by Pier Antonio dell'Abate, who along with Benedetto Montagna frescoed a chapel on site.Touring Club Guide, entry on church.

Historic England describe the church as \\"a fine example of mid-Victorian church-building by an important architect of the Gothic Revival\\", Samuel Teulon. Location The church is located just to the north of Sutton town centre, to the east of Angel Hill on All Saints Road and looking down towards Sutton Green. It stands on an artificial platform built up on a south-facing slope. The hill on which the church stands was partially formed as a result of earth moved there during the building of the Angel Hill cutting in the 1770s. Its large size and prominent location makes it a local landmark. History The parish of Benhilton was created on 15 September 1863, and the foundation stone of the Grade II* listed church, designed by Samuel Teulon in the Gothic Revival style, was laid in the same year. The building owed much to Thomas Alcock who was then lord of the manor, and who gave ¬£18,000 towards the building, the land for the church, the vicarage and a school. The church was conceived as an amenity for an estate of upper class Victorian housing which Alcock was developing on the land to the east.London Gardens Online The nave and south aisle were finished first, the tower and chancel were added in 1867, while the north aisle was not fully roofed until 1906. The church has always been noted for its bells; the first was the tenor bell, which was presented by Thomas Alcock and was rung on the day the church was consecrated. The framework for a complete peal was fixed in the tower in 1877. Another bell was added the same year, and a third the year after. By 1882 there were six and all eight were inaugurated on 1 November 1893 (All Saints Day).London Borough of Sutton ‚Äî ArticleSutton Benhilton, All Saints - About the church Kelly's Directory of Surrey 1903 contains the following entry: \\"Benhilton ecclesiastical parish was formed out of the parish of Sutton, September 15, 1863. The church of All Saints, erected in 1865, at a cost, including site, house, schools and endowment, of ¬£24,000, is of flint, in the Early Decorated style, and has a tower containing a clock and 8 bells: the stained east window is a memorial to Thomas Alcock esq.: there are 874 sittings, one half being free. The register dates from the year 1866. The living is a vicarage, yearly value ¬£375, with 1 acre of glebe and residence, in the gift of E.G.

Architectural features Stained glass window All Saints Church, Benhilton - interior All Saints Church, Benhilton The church is made up a wide nave with rounded clerestorey windows, a chancel, north and south aisles, Lady Chapel, vestries with organ chamber above, imposing west tower, and north and south porches. It is brick built with flint facing externally, natural stone dressings with trussed timber roof covered with plain clay tiles.The Diocese of Southwark Historic England (formerly English Heritage) describes the church as \\"a fine example of mid-Victorian church-building by an important architect of the Gothic Revival. It is unaltered externally, and possesses a flint and masonry construction. It has a number of fixtures of interest, including some important 1960s stained glass and a striking roof.\\" The church has a large four-stage tower at its western end. The tower features a doorway and a four- light window which has, like the other principal windows of the church, flowing tracery. There are three clocks in the third stage of the tower on its north, south and west faces under a gable containing flowing tracery. In the belfry stage the opening on each face is a two-light reticulated window. The tower has diagonal buttresses to its west face, and a NE stair turret which rises above the plain parapets of the top of the tower. The aisles have lean- to roofs and above these, sandwiched in a narrow band below the eaves of the nave, is a clerestory with circular windows with alternating triskele and mouchette-and-quatrefoil infilling. The aisle windows are broad and have flowing tracery in the three lights, alternating in design in each bay. The southern chapel and northern vestry/organ chamber lie under their own gables and have florid three-light fenestration similar to that in the aisles. Both porches have moulded outer doorways. The northern porch is vaulted. An unusual feature of the exterior walls is the widespread traces of former putlog holes, no doubt used for the scaffolding during the construction of the building. These are often found on medieval buildings but were usually carefully filled in and obliterated on Victorian ones. Here they are made a feature of with the side pieces and cappings clearly evident. The hood stops of the arch heads have nearly all been left uncarved.

Trump was formally elected by the Electoral College on December 19, 2016. The transition was formerly led by Chris Christie until he and a number of his supporters were replaced or demoted on November 11. The results were certified by a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2017, and the transition ended when Trump was inaugurated at noon EST on January 20, 2017. Transition procedures In accordance with the Pre- Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010, candidate transition teams are provided office space by the General Services Administration (GSA). Transition teams are also eligible for government funding for staff; spending on Mitt Romney's transition team in 2012 was $8.9 million, all funds appropriated by the U.S. government. Under existing federal law and custom, the Republican Party's nominee became eligible to receive classified national security briefings once his/her nomination was formalized at the party's national convention. = Responsibilities = Key responsibilities of a presidential transition include the identification and vetting of candidates for approximately 4,000 non-civil service positions in the U.S. government whose service is at the pleasure of the president; arranging the occupancy of executive residences including the White House, One Observatory Circle, and Camp David; liaising with the United States Strategic Command for receipt of the Gold Codes; and briefing senior civil service personnel about a new administration's policy priorities. = Recent developments = A law enacted by the United States Congress in 2016 amending the Presidential Transition Act requires the incumbent president to establish \\"transition councils\\" by June of an election year to facilitate the eventual handover of power. The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), meanwhile, launched a new program called \\"Transition 2016\\" in 2016. Led by Ed DeSeve and David S. C. Chu, the program was described by NAPA as one which provides management and procedural advice to the leading candidates in establishing transition teams.  Timeline  = Pre-election = In April 2016, representatives from the Trump campaign, as well as the campaigns of four other then-running Republican candidates, met in New York with representatives of the Partnership for Public Service to receive a two-day briefing and overview of the transition process. According to Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, the campaign shortly thereafter began implementing the recommendations provided at the meeting. In early May 2016, after Trump became the presumptive nominee, campaign officials announced they would name the members of a presidential transition team within the \\"upcoming weeks\\". On May 6, The New York Times reported that Trump had asked Jared Kushner to begin work on putting a transition team together. Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort worked with Kushner in the selection of a transition chief. Three days later, Trump announced that New Jersey Governor (and former rival presidential candidate) Chris Christie had agreed to head the effort. On Friday, June 3, 2016, the Agency Transition Directors Council first assembled at the White House to review transition plans of each of the major executive departments; neither the Trump nor Clinton campaigns sent representatives to this initial meeting. At about the same time, the White House began transferring its preceding eight years of accumulated electronic files to the National Archives and Records Administration's Electronic Record Archive for preservation. The transition planning came under heavy criticism for lagging behind other recent transition planning efforts when it was shown to have hired only a \\"handful\\" of staff by late July. At that time, Chris Christie named Bill Palatucci, a corporate attorney from New Jersey and the state's Republican National Committeeman, as general counsel; Palatucci reportedly began meeting with senior members of Mitt Romney's 2012 transition team shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, on July 29, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough led a conference call with Chris Christie to discuss transition procedures. During the call, McDonough informed Christie that Anita Breckenridge and Andrew Mayock will be the administration's primary \\"points of contact\\" with the Trump campaign moving forward. The pair also discussed the planned availability of office space at 1717 Pennsylvania Avenue for the Trump transition team, which the General Services Administration was to make available beginning August 2, 2016. During the first week of August, the Trump transition office was officially opened. The same month, William F. Hagerty, a former member of Mitt Romney's transition team, was named director of appointments while John Rader, a senior aide to United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Bob Corker, was retained in the position of deputy director of appointments. In an example of \\"how removed the transition process is from the tumult and rancor of the campaign\\", representatives of the Trump and Clinton transition teams began holding a series of meetings with each other, and with White House officials, to plan details of the transition process. By October, it was reported the transition team had grown to more than 100 staff, many of whom were policy experts brought aboard to compensate for a dearth of policy staff employed by the Trump campaign. For example, in October 2016, Robert Smith Walker, former chairman of the House Science Committee, was appointed space policy advisor. A November 9 memo from Ash Carter to the United States armed forces informed them of the pending transfer of military command. = Immediate post-election = In the early hours of November 9, 2016, media outlets reported Trump would secure enough votes in the Electoral College to win the presidential election, and become the 45th president of the United States. Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton conceded the election to him later that day.  Security enhancements  Prior to Trump's return to his private residence at Trump Tower, the United States Secret Service initiated \\"unbelievable security measures\\", including closing East 56th Street to all traffic, reinforcing a cordon of sand-laden dump trucks that had been placed around the building the night before to defend the site from being rammed with a car bomb, and deploying New York City Police Department tactical teams around the skyscraper. The FAA, meanwhile, ordered a flight restriction over midtown Manhattan.  Trump business interests  Map shows the number of companies owned by Donald Trump that are operating in each country: Following his victory at the election, Trump began transferring control of the Trump Organization to the company's other executives, including his three oldest children; Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric Trump in a blind trust. According to a November 11 statement from the Trump Organization, it was \\"in the process of vetting various structures with the goal of the immediate transfer of management of the Trump Organization and its portfolio of businesses\\". At a press conference on January 11, 2017, Trump said he and his eldest daughter Ivanka would resign all management roles with the Trump Organization by inauguration day, January 20. Its assets would be put into a trust run by his two oldest sons Donald Jr. and Eric, together with existing chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Trump would continue to own the business. At the press conference, Trump attorney Sheri Dillon made a substantial presentation on the legal structure that was being put in place for the Trump Organization during the presidency. \\"No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump's presidency,\\" Dillon said, and new domestic deals \\"will go through a vigorous vetting process\\" and President Trump will have no role in them, among other assertions.McCaskill, Nolan D., \\"Highlights from Trump's press conference\\" , Politico, January 11, 2017. Retrieved February 18, 2017. = Beginning of transition process = Shortly after noon on November 9, outgoing president Barack Obama made a statement from the Rose Garden of the White House, in which he announced that he had spoken, the previous evening, with Trump and formally invited him to the White House the next day, November 10, for discussions to ensure \\"that there is a successful transition between our presidencies\\". President Obama said he had instructed his staff to \\"follow the example\\" of the George W. Bush administration in 2008, who he said could \\"not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition\\". The same day, United States secretary of defense Ash Carter issued a memo to the United States armed forces informing them of the pending transfer of National Command Authority to a new administration. Also on November 9, the U.S. Intelligence Community offered the full President's Daily Brief to Trump and Mike Pence, with Trump receiving his first brief on November 15 in his office at Trump Tower. The Trump transition website launched on the evening of November 9, 2016 By the afternoon of November 9, a transition website ‚Äì greatagain.gov ‚Äì had been launched. The website provided information on transition procedures and information for the media. The website was later criticized for reposting content originally created by the Partnership for Public Service, however, Partnership CEO Max Stier declined to criticize the use and noted that the organization had been working with the major campaigns on transition planning, explaining that he hoped the group's materials would be \\"a resource that is used for the betterment of transitions\\". Content on the transition website was licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. Trump and Obama met for the first time on November 10. At 11:00a.m. on November 10, the president and president-elect held a private, 90-minute meeting at the White House, which was followed by a joint media availability in the Oval Office with a press pool composed of journalists from Reuters, Voice of America, Bloomberg, the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, ABC News, and McClatchey syndicate. During the availability, Trump thanked Obama for their meeting and said he looked forward to tapping him for future counsel. According to Trump, Obama convinced him, during their discussion, to retain certain aspects of his signature policy Obamacare, including the ban on insurance companies denying new coverage to those with pre-existing conditions and the right of parents to keep their adult children on their health insurance policies until the age of 25. =November 11 reshuffle= On November 11, Trump telephoned transition head Chris Christie and told him his involvement with the Bridgegate scandal was a political liability and his performance heading the transition unsatisfactory (Trump, later, also expressed private frustration at Christie's retention of lobbyists in key transition posts). At the end of the call, Trump fired Christie from his position as transition chair. Over the next twenty-four hours, and with little warning, Christie loyalists were quickly removed from the transition team in what was characterized by NBC News as a \\"Stalinesque purge\\". Transition executive Richard Bagger, for instance, found himself suddenly locked-out of the transition team's offices. Bill Palatucci, Mike Rogers, and others, were also among those removed. Immediately after the reshuffle, Mike Pence was elevated to transition chair by Trump. Under Christie, many of the members of the transition team were registered lobbyists who had worked on issues overseen by the agencies they were charged with staffing or affected by policies they were preparing. However, by November 16, Pence had introduced new restrictions that Politico described as \\"in some ways far more rigid than President Barack Obama's groundbreaking lobbyist ban\\". Under the new rules, while incoming administration officials who are currently registered lobbyists would be allowed, they would have to sign documents forfeiting their ability to re-register as lobbyists for five years after departing government. In addition, Pence ordered that all lobbyists be removed from the transition team, with Politico reporting two days later that staff members who were registered lobbyists had begun to resign. =Pence's tenure= On November 15, Trump requested security clearance for son-in-law Jared Kushner (a member of the transition team), which would allow him to attend the full President's Daily Brief ‚Äì a request that experts have called \\"unprecedented\\". As of November 15, all briefings of the transition team by government were on hold pending the need for incoming chair Mike Pence to sign an agreement with the Obama administration. On November 16, Trump met with Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, who had been discussed as a possible contender for several cabinet positions. Trump also met with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. On November 17, Trump met with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger in order to discuss matters relating to foreign affairs. Later that day, Trump met with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in an informal visit at Trump Tower. After the meeting, which was attended by Michael T. Flynn and Ivanka Trump, Abe said he had \\"great confidence\\" in Trump and described their discussion as \\"very candid\\". Past and current State Department officials, however, were disturbed by Ivanka's presence. Moira Whelan, a former John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign staffer who left the department in July after serving as a deputy assistant secretary for digital strategy in the U.S. Department of State, averred that \\"anyone present for such a conversation between two heads of state should, at a minimum, have security clearance, and should also be an expert in Japanese affairs ... meeting of two heads of state [sic] is never an informal occurrence. Even a casual mention or a nod of agreement or an assertion left unchallenged can be interpreted in different ways\\". On December 6, Michael G. Flynn, the son of Michael T. Flynn, was forced out of the transition team. Spokesman Jason Miller did not identify the reason for Flynn's dismissal; however, The New York Times reported that other officials had confirmed it was related to a tweet he made regarding the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. On December 14, Trump met with CEOs and representatives from Silicon Valley tech companies in Trump Tower.

Cabinet designees  The following have been named as cabinet appointees by the president; all positions, except chief of staff and vice president, require the advice and consent of the United States Senate prior to taking office. On November 30, Politico, which viewed Trump's chosen administration nominees as being more conservative as opposed to previous presidential administrations, described Trump as \\"well on his way to building a conservative dream team that has Republicans cheering and liberals in despair.\\" On the other hand, The Wall Street Journal stated that \\"it's nearly impossible to identify a clear ideological bent in the incoming president's\\" cabinet nominations. The Washington Post noted that Trump's cabinet would be \\"the wealthiest administration in modern American history.\\" The Post also noted that while some of Trump's appointments consisted of \\"his staunchest and most controversial allies\\" such as Bannon, Flynn and Sessions, other appointments appealed to the Republican establishment and had \\"the imprint of Mike Pence\\".

The lake covers . It is the largest of the Warner Lakes system. The lake is named for pioneer rancher Thomas Crump. Crump Lake is owned by the Oregon Department of State Lands. Much of the land around the lake is administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The lake and the surrounding wetlands support a wide variety of birds and other wildlife. Recreational opportunities on or near Crump Lake include fishing, bird watching, and camping.  Geography  Crump Lake is located north of the unincorporated community of Adel, Oregon at the southern end of the Warner Valley in south-central Oregon.\\"Crump Lake\\", Bird Research Northwest, a joint project of Oregon State University, United State Geological Survey, and Real Time Research Incorporated, Bend, Oregon, 29 September 2013.United States Geological Survey topographic map, ACME mapper, www.acme.com, March 29, 2009. The valley is approximately long and wide. Most of the valley is in Lake County, however the north end of the valley extends about into Harney County. It is an alluvial basin containing numerous lakes, remnants of a single great lake that covered the valley floor up to deep during the Pleistocene epoch. Today, steep cliffs rise above a chain of endorheic lakes including Crump Lake, known collectively as Warner Lakes. The valley has two regions commonly referred to as South Warner Valley and North Warner Valley. The two areas transition between Crump Lake in the south and Hart Lake to the north at a point where the valley narrows to about in width.Whistler, John T. and John H. Lewis, \\"Location and General Conditions\\", Warner Valley and White River Projects, United States Reclamation Service, United States Department of Interior in cooperation with the State of Oregon, Washington D.C., February 1916, pp. 16‚Äì19.\\"Crump Lake (Lake County)\\", Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon, accessed 29 April 2016.Johnson, Daniel M., \\"Crump Lake\\", Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Oregon State University Press, Corvallis, Oregon, 1985, p. 84.Warner Wetlands Area of Critical Environmental Concern, Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, August 26, 2005. There are numerous lakes in the Warner Lakes chain. Starting at the south end of the valley, the Warner Lakes are Pelican Lake, Crump Lake, Hart Lake, Anderson Lake, Swamp Lake, Mugwump Lake, Flagstaff Lake, Upper Campbell Lake, Lower Campbell Lake, Stone Corral Lake, Turpin Lake, and Bluejoint Lake. The valley slopes toward the north. As a result, the elevation of Crump Lake is higher than Bluejoint Lake. Ultimately, the Warner Lakes system has no outlet so its waters eventually evaporate from the lake surfaces and associated wetlands.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

History  Native Americans used the Warner Valley's lakes and wetland for thousands of years before the first white explorers arrived. There are ancient Native American petroglyphs near Crump Lake, some are estimated to be 12,000 years old. The Greaser Petroglyph Site, located approximately southeast of Crump Lake, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Cultural Resources\\", Summary of the Analysis of the Management Situation for the Lakeview Resource Area ‚Äì Resource Management Plan, Lakeview Field Office, Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United State Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, July 2000, pp. 2.28‚Äì29.\\"Greaser Petroglyph Site\\", Focus Digital Asset Management System, National Information Services Center, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Lakewood, Colorado, accessed 30 April 2016. In 1867, General George Crook decided to build a fort in the Warner Valley to prevent Indian raiding parties from passing through the area. To get his wagons across the wetlands, he directed a bridge be built across a narrow, marshy channel between Crump Lake and Hart Lake. Forty soldiers of the 23rd Infantry Regiment under the command of Captain James Henton were assigned the task. The bridge was constructed between 16 May and 24 July 1867. Known as the Stone Bridge, it was actually a quarter mile long causeway constructed by hauling basalt boulders and smaller rocks from the slopes of nearby Hart Mountain and dumping them into the marsh. Today, the Stone Bridge across the Warner wetlands still exists.

E., \\"Geologist Believes Crump Geyser Should be Saved\\" , Lake County Examiner, Lakeview, Oregon, 6 August 1959.\\"The Crump Geyser‚ÄîSpouted Becomes True Geyser, Spouts 100 Feet\\" , Lake County Examiner, Lakeview, Oregon, 9 June 1960.Peterson, Norman V., \\"Lake County‚Äôs New Continuous Geyser\\", The Ore-Bin (Volume 21, No. 9), Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, Portland, Oregon, September 1959, p. 83. Originally, there was a small island near the center of Crump Lake used by nesting water birds. During a drought period in the 1950s, the island was scoured away by heavy equipment being used to unearth Native American artifacts. In the 1990s, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife attempted to restore the island, but wind and wave action quickly eroded it away again. In 2008, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a nesting site at the location of the original island. It was specifically designed to resist erosion and the surface was covered with sand and gravel to create nesting habitat for Caspian terns. Since its completion, the new island has become a successful nested site for terns and other water birds. In 2015, the Oregon Department of State Lands closed Crump Lake to the public because several years of drought had dramatically reduced the lake's water level. The closure was intended to protect the lakebed from looting by cultural artifact hunters. This temporary closure was lifted in October 2016, as state officials determined water levels to be improved.\\"State lifts closure for Hart, Crump and Goose lakes\\", news release 15-02, Oregon Department of State Lands, Salem, Oregon, 26 January 2015.\\"Hart and Crump lakes now open to the public\\", news release 16-14, Oregon Department of State Lands, Salem, Oregon, 4 October 2016.  Lake environment  Crump Lake and its shoreline environmentCrump Lake is a natural lake that covers . It is approximately long and wide, making it the largest of the Warner Lakes under normal conditions. The lake has an average depth of with a maximum depth of . It received a steady flow of fresh water from Deep Creek and Twelvemile Creek which helps to stabilize the water level in the lake. It also receives excess water from Pelican Lake through a series of marshy channels. The outflow from Crump Lake drains north into Hart Lake through a narrow wetland channel.Phillips, Kenneth N., and A. S. Van Denburgh, \\"Water Supply\\", Hydrology and Geochemistry of Abert, Summer, and Goose Lakes, and Other Closed-Basin Lakes in South-Central Oregon, United States Geological Survey Professional Paper 502-B, United States Geological Survey, Washington, District of Columbia, 1971, p. B-38. The water clarity in Crump Lake is murky due to the presence of suspended organic particles. Sodium and potassium are the most abundant of the dissolved elements, together they comprise 46 percent of the dissolved-solids in the lake. However, because the lake overflows for several months during most years, Crump Lake has less turbidity than most closed-basin lakes. The water transparency is not a good indicator of the lake's trophic state. In fact, the amount of nutrients in the lake is very high with significant concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyll indicating a hypereutrophic condition.Phillips, Kenneth N., and A. S. Van Denburgh, \\"Abstract\\", Hydrology and Geochemistry of Abert, Summer, and Goose Lakes, and Other Closed-Basin Lakes in South-Central Oregon, United States Geological Survey Professional Paper 502-B, Washington, District of Columbia, 1971, p. B-2.Phillips, Kenneth N., and A. S.

B-42.  Ecology  Crump Lake provides a unique habitat for plants and animals. The main cliff face of Hart Mountain ends near the north end of the lake, providing a rim rock habitat in that area. The area along the lake's eastern shore is typical high desert scrubland dominated by big sagebrush. The areas to the south and west of the lake are mostly mashes, meadows, and grasslands. In these areas, marsh grasses are common along the lake shores. Common wildlife includes common high desert mammals, resident birds, and migrant waterfowl.Rakestraw, John, Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge and the Warner Valley, Morris Book Publishing: Kearney, Nebraska, 2007, pp. 20‚Äì22. The lake provides wildlife habitatCrump Lake's native fish species include a Warner Valley subspecies of redband trout and the Warner sucker. The redband trout and a small population of Warner suckers are found in Twelvemile Creek as well as the lake. Redband trout are also found in Deep Creek. These stream-dwelling populations have likely been the source for re-colonizing Crump Lake after extended drought periods killed off the lake's fish populations. In addition to the native fish, crappie, smallmouth bass, and bullhead catfish have been introduced into the Crump Lake. These non-native species have put significant pressure on the native fish species. As a result, the Warner Valley redband trout and the Warner sucker are classified as threatened species.\\"Distribution and Abundance of Threatened and Rare Native Fishes\\", Recovery Plan for the Native Fishes of the Warner Basin and Alkali Subbasin, Oregon State office, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, April 1998, pp. 11‚Äì13, 15.\\"Introduced Predaceous Fishes\\", Recovery Plan for the Native Fishes of the Warner basin and Alkali Subbasin, Oregon State office, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, April 1998, pp. 28‚Äì30. There are over forty mammal species that live in the areas around Crump Lake. These include pronghorn, bighorn sheep, elk, mule deer, cougar, bobcat, and coyotes. Smaller mammals include jackrabbits, ground squirrels, chipmunks, skunks, and muskrats.Douglas, Jeff (producer), \\"Warner Wetlands\\", Oregon Field Guide video (Episode 1005), Oregon Public Broadcasting, Portland, Oregon, 1 February 1999.\\"Wildlife list for Crump Lake\\", Wildlife Explorer, Institute for Natural Resources, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, accessed 3 May 2016. There are numerous species of birds that live near Crump Lake or stop over at the lake during their migrations. Species that nest in the areas around Hart Lake include sandhill cranes, American white pelicans, double-crested cormorants, willets, Wilson's phalaropes, American coots, gadwalls, northern shovelers, black-crowned night herons, Canada geese, and numerous varieties of ducks and terns. In addition, white-faced ibis, great white egrets, and American avocets are found in the marshes and along the lake shores. There are observation blinds maintained by the Bureau of Land Management at the near-by Warner Wetlands Interpretive Site where American bitterns, black-necked stilts, cinnamon teal, tundra swans, Brewer's blackbirds, western meadowlarks, swallows, and nighthawks are commonly seen.Crump Lake , Basin and Range Birding Trail‚ÄîSouthern Oregon, Bureau of Land Management and seven other agencies, Lakeview, Oregon, 2005. In the meadows and marshes around the lake, dusky flycatchers, yellow warblers, orange-crowned warblers, house wrens, and spotted towhees are common in the summer months. The valley around Crump Lake also hosts mountain chickadees, Cassin's finches, black-headed grosbeaks, green-tailed towhees, yellow-rumped warblers, MacGillivray's warblers, mountain bluebirds, white-headed woodpeckers, burrowing owls, and flammulated owls. The larger birds common to the Crump Lake area include great horned owls, barn owls, long-eared owls, prairie falcons, marsh hawks, golden eagles, and bald eagles.  Recreation  Crump Lake is owned and managed by the Oregon Department of State Lands. Large sections of the Warner Valley around the lake are also publicly owned. The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for much of this land. In addition, the land along the north side of the lake is part of the Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge which is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. These public lands offer numerous recreational opportunities including fishing, bird watching, boating, hunting, and camping. However, some of these activities are dependent on the water levels of the Warner Lakes system, which can fluctuate dramatically from year to year.\\"Warner Wetlands\\", Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, October 12, 2009. During most years, Crump Lake is available for fishing and boating. While most people fish from the shore, small boats and canoes are also used to fish on the lake. The most popular game fish are crappie, largemouth bass, and brown bullhead. During an extended period of high water in the mid-1980s, crappie fishing was particularly good with some catches exceeding two pounds.Shewey, John, \\"Crump Lake (Lake County)\\", Complete Angler's Guide to Oregon, Wilderness Adventure Press, Belgrade, Montana, 2007, p. 332. There are no developed campgrounds near Crump Lake. However, dispersed camping is allowed on Bureau of Land Management administered lands near to the lake. There is also a day-use recreation site approximately north of Crump Lake at the Warner Wetlands Interpretive Site. The site has public restrooms, sheltered picnic tables, birdwatching areas, and hiking trails.

Born in Kutoarjo, Central Java, Soekarno entered the film industry in 1941, making his debut appearance in Union Films' Soeara Berbisa. Over the next forty years he appeared in more than fifty films. He was also involved in the theatre during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies and the Indonesian National Revolution. For his role in 1962's Bajangan di Waktu Fadjar, he was named best supporting actor at the 1963 Asian Film Festival in Tokyo. Biography Soekarno was born in Kutoarjo, Central Java, on 7 May 1920. The son of a noble priyayi family, he had access to a high level of education, completing his MULO studies before learning bookkeeping. His first job was as the bookkeeper for a cinema. In 1941, as the domestic film industry was seeking young, educated actors to improve the public perception of cinema, Soekarno was approached by Union Films and cast in their production Soeara Berbisa, a film which told of two men who compete for a woman's love before discovering that they are brothers. He appeared in another film for Union later that year, when he played a young assistant pharmacist in the company's romance Mega Mendoeng (1942). In March 1942, following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Union was closed, and Soekarno, though working on an adaptation of the legend Damarwulan, was let go. Soekarno with Boen Sofiati in Mega Mendoeng (1942) Soekarno migrated to theatre, spending most of the occupation with the amateur theatre troupe Maya (under Usmar Ismail), though he did act in a single short propaganda film: Di Menara (1943). Following the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the Dutch colonial forces, supported by the Allies, returned to the Indonesian archipelago. In the ensuing Indonesian National Revolution (1945‚Äì1949), Soekarno was active with Fred Young's Bintang Soerabaja professional theatre troupe. In 1948, towards the end of the revolution, Soekarno returned to film, taking a role in the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC) production Anggrek Bulan. On this film, he again worked with Ismail, who was serving as assistant director. Soekarno took another two roles in SPFC films in 1949, in Harta Karun and Tjitra. When the company was merged with Berita Film Indonesia to form Perusahaan Film Negara (PFN; the State Film Company), Soekarno migrated to Young's Bintang Surabaja and appeared in a number of their films, including Bintang Surabaja 1951 (1950), Djembatan Merah (1950), and Selamat Berdjuang, Masku! (1951). As the 1950s progressed, Soekarno worked for a number of companies, including Djamaluddin Malik's Persari (Rodrigo de Villa, 1952) and PFN (Penjelundup, 1952). He also made his directorial debut in Rentjong dan Surat (1953). Soekarno's greatest popularity, however, was attained through his work with Ismail's Perfini studio, for whom he first appeared in 1953's Kafedo and Krisis. He gained the greatest popular recognition for his role in the latter film, a comedy about the conflicts between different families occupying the same house, and appeared in its sequel Lagi-Lagi Krisis two years later. Shortly afterwards, Soekarno changed his name to Rendra Karno, heeding a recent demand from President Soekarno that all European and feudal names (such as the title Raden) be abandoned. Rendra Karno (right) reading actors' demands to President Soekarno (centre) in front of Merdeka Palace, Jakarta, in 1956 As a member of the (Persatuan Artis Film Indonesia, or PARFI), Rendra Karno was also involved in efforts to protect the struggling domestic film industry against imported films from Malaysia, India, and the United States. On 12 March 1956, Rendra Karno went to Merdeka Palace, Jakarta, together with nine other actors and actresses to read a list of demands to President Soekarno. These included a reconsideration of existing import laws, the establishment of a film library, and increased involvement of Indonesia in international film festivals. These demands, however, were not met. Rendra Karno remained active with Perfini into the 1960s, appearing in such productions as Tiga Dara (1956), Tjambuk Api (1958), Pedjuang (1960), and Bajangan di Waktu Fadjar (1962). For this last film, a collaboration between Perfini and Merdeka Film of Malaysia, he received best supporting actor at the 1963 Asian Film Festival in Tokyo. In 1965, after appearing in Tjendrawasih Films' Takkan Lari Gunung Dikedjar, he took a five-year sabbatical. In 1971 Rendra Karno returned to the Indonesian film industry, appearing in and serving as assistant director for Hutan Tantangan. Over the next decade he appeared in a further eight films, including Putri Solo (1974) and Para Perintis Kemerdekaan (1977); Karno also worked as a crew member for several productions. Rendra Karno died in Jakarta on 27 November 1985. Filmography During his four decades as an actor, Soekarno (Rendra Karno) appeared in some fifty-two roles.

It supported Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The PAC aimed to respond to negative online narratives about Clinton. History The organization was created in May 2015 when it spun off from American Bridge 21st Century, another Democratic Super PAC. It coordinated with Clinton's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign via a loophole in campaign finance law that it says permits coordination with digital campaigns. Purpose In July 2015, Correct the Record teamed with Priorities USA Action, another pro-Clinton super PAC, to create a fundraising committee called American Priorities ‚Äô16. In October 2015, historian Allida Black and political strategist Connor Shaw launched \\"Let's Talk Hillary\\" in partnership with Correct the Record and Wild Onion Media. The $1 million dollar project was used to give Hillary Clinton's long time friends and co-workers a platform to describe the woman they knew. The project was largely considered a success and awarded numerous awards, including the Golden Donkey in 2015. In April 2016, Correct the Record announced that it would be spending $1 million to find and confront social media users who post unflattering messages about Clinton in a \\"task force\\" called \\"Barrier Breakers 2016\\". In addition to this, the task force aimed to encourage Sanders supporters to support Clinton and to thank both \\"prominent supporters and committed superdelegates\\". The organization's president, Brad Woodhouse, said they had \\"about a dozen people engaged in [producing] nothing but positive content on Hillary Clinton\\" and had a team distributing information \\"particularly of interest to women\\".Ben Luke, Artists raise millions for Hillary Clinton . The Super PAC ran ads against Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. In September 2016, Correct the Record announced a project called \\"Trump Leaks\\". Correct the Record said it would pay anonymous tipsters for unflattering scoops about Donald Trump, including audio and video recordings and internal documents. On December 31, 2016, the official website was deactivated from its host's servers WPEngine.Wayback Machine archive capture of 404 page taken on December 31, 2016 Legality Super PACs, officially known as \\"independent expenditure-only committees\\", are political committees that are legally only allowed to make expenditures that are independent of specific campaigns and which are not coordinated with a candidate or political party. However, Correct the Record says its activities do not fall under this campaign coordination ban restriction, relying on a 2006 Federal Election Commission \\"Internet exemption\\" regulation that said that content posted online for free is off limits from regulation. According to FEC rules, online postings do not technically count as campaign expenditures, which allows independent groups to consult with candidates about the content they post on their sites.

He was educated at the local primary school and after finishing his education became a storekeeper. From 1928 until 1950 he worked as a painter for the State Works Department of Queensland On 9 April 1913 he married Annie Campbell (died 1986)Deceased Search -- Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 7 May 2016. and together had two sons and four daughters. Gardner died in Brisbane in November 1966 and was buried in the Hemmant Cemetery. Public career Gardner, a member of the Labor Party, won the seat of Bulimba at the 1950 Queensland state election, beating the sitting Independent Labor member, George Marriott and the Liberal Party candidate, John Hamilton. However, Hamilton appealed the decision and the Acting Chief Justice, Alan Mansfield found that there gross fraud committed in the election. Fake ballot papers had been lodged, and whilst Mansfield did not put any of the blame on Gardner, he ruled the Gardner's election win to be void. A by-election was held in April 1951, and once again Gardner won the seat. Two days after the by-election, Bernard Maguire, the Chief Electoral Officer, was charged with eight counts of having forged ballot papers. In September 1951 though, the Crown dropped the case after a jury failed three times to reach a verdict and Maguire was then discharged. Gardner went on to hold the seat until the 1957 Queensland state election, having sided with Premier Vince Gair to join the newly formed QLP after the ALP had split two months earlier. He was defeated by future Opposition leader, Jack Houston of the ALP. He was a member of the Bulimba Hockey Association, the Australian Natives Association, and Valleys Rugby League Old Boys Association.

The structure of vein 8 of hindwings in the male is extraordinary. It is appressed to the cell towards the base, then curved up towards the costa, and presently receives towards its apex what appears to be an additional vein rising from the cell at about two-thirds, but must really be a long very oblique bar formed by extension of an original anastomosis at a point.Exotic Microlepidoptera 4 (10): 290 References Category:Moths described in 1855 frontalis Category:Moths of Central America Category:Moths of Mexico ","title":"Antaeotricha frontalis"},{"id":"50450983","text":"Antaeotricha mendax is a moth in the family Depressariidae.

He was one of the leaders in the development of radiology as a distinct specialty in New Zealand, and with his brother, Neil, he wrote four books on the history of Fiordland. Early life and family Born in Wellington on 28 February 1912, Begg was the older son of surgeon Charles Mackie Begg and Lillian Helen Lawrance Begg (n√©e Treadwell), and nephew of Robert Campbell Begg. His father served throughout World War I, becoming the senior medical officer with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, but contracted influenza and pneumonia and died at Twickenham, London, in February 1919. Begg and his mother and brother, who had travelled to England at the end of the war, then returned to New Zealand. Begg was educated at John McGlashan College in Dunedin, and went on to study medicine at the University of Otago, graduating MB ChB in 1936. A tall man, Begg was an Otago provincial golf representative. On 1 February 1941, Begg married Margaret Annie Birks (24 March 1910 ‚Äì 29 May 1989), at Silverstream. Also a doctor, Birks had been in the same graduating class as Begg at Otago. She was a daughter of electrical engineer Lawrence Birks. The couple went on to have five children. Medical career Begg worked as a house surgeon at Dunedin Public Hospital, before travelling to London in 1937 to become a surgeon. However, World War II intervened before he was able to take his final examination, and after contracting rheumatic fever he returned to New Zealand in 1941. He then decided to study radiology, and in 1946 became the first person to gain a diploma of diagnostic radiology at the University of Otago. He graduated MD the following year. Awarded a Nuffield Scholarship, he undertook study in Britain, North America and Scandinavia in 1949 and 1950. In 1956 Begg was appointed head of diagnostic radiology at Dunedin Hospital, and in 1971 he became an associate professor in that specialty at Otago Medical School, retiring in 1977. He played an important role in the founding of the Neurological Association of New Zealand in 1957, and was actively involved in the Royal College of Radiologists of Australasia. Historian and conservationist Begg and his brother Neil became experts on the history of Fiordland. Their first book, Dusky Bay, was published in 1966 and won the Hubert Church Memorial Award for prose. They subsequently published James Cook and New Zealand in 1969, Port Preservation in 1973, and The World of John Boultbee in 1979. He served as president of the Otago branch of the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand. Death Begg died in Nelson on 23 June 1991, his wife having pre-deceased him in 1989.

He was a recipient of the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky. He was the second Syrian Arabic-speaking patriarch to become Patriarch of Antioch after the position had been held by ethnic Greek bishops for 175 years. In 1913, he was a special guest in St. Petersburg of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia at the three hundredth anniversary of the rise of the Romanov dynasty to power. Life Ghantus Haddad was born on July 1, 1859, the son of son of Girjis, son of Ghantus Haddad in the village of Abayh of the Shuf district of Mount Lebanon. He began his education in a village school conducted by an American Protestant Mission. Ghantus developed the desire for a career in the Holy Orders, and as a teenager requested of Archbishop Ghufara‚Äôel, who was Metropolitan of Archdiocese of Beirut and Mount Lebanon, to be allowed to join his ecclesiastical school. Receiving the approval of Abp. Ghufara‚Äôel, Ghantus joined the school on May 10, 1872. There, he studied under Shahin‚ÄòAtatiyyah. Having shown himself a model student who surpassed all other students in academic achievement, Ghantus became the private secretary of Abp. Ghufra‚Äôel on December 24, 1875, at the age of sixteen. On December 19, 1877, he entered the Nuriyyah Monastery with the name Gregory. On August 29, 1879, he was ordained a deacon. With his new dignity, Dcn. Gregory was placed in charge of the St. Paul‚Äôs Society which was responsible for aiding the Orthodox Churches and schools of Mount Lebanon. He continued with this responsibility until the St. Paul‚Äôs Society was dissolved when the Archdiocese was split into two: that of Beirut and Mount Lebanon in 1901. In 1883, Gregory was made editor and published the Orthodox newspaper Al-Haddiyah. In May 1890, Gregory was elected Archbishop of Tripoli. He was consecrated by Patriarch Gerasimos of Antioch shortly before Gerasimos moved to the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. As Archbishop of Tripoli, Gregory led with love and dedication to the common good, and soon healed the divisions that had grown under his predecessor Abp. Sofronios Najjar. Under his leadership, Orthodox life in Tripoli grew, including new churches, schools, and charitable organizations. Among the schools he founded was that of Kiftin which from 1893 to 1897 produced many of the learned men of this period. On June 29, 1906, Abp. Gregory was elected by the Holy Synod of the Church of Antioch as Patriarch and successor to Malatius II. His consecration took place on August 26, 1906 in the Patriarchal Church of the Virgin in Damascus. With his consecration as patriarch, Patr. Gregory IV became the second Arab to ascend to the see of Antioch after it had been occupied by ethnic Greek hierarchs for 175 years, from 1724 to 1899, that is from the ascension of Sylvester the Cypriot to the deposition of Spiridon in 1898. As a result the election of Arab patriarchs, the Greek Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria and Jerusalem did not recognized the elections of Malatius and Gregory to the Patriarchal see because they were not ethnic Greeks. After a decade, however, the patriarchs changed their position. On August 14, 1909, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Joachim III, sent a letter to Gregory recognizing his election and established communion with him. The Patriarch of Jerusalem followed suit on September 29. Having commended Gregory on his virtues and honesty, their acceptance of Gregory's election ended the ethnic conflict over the See of Antioch. With his enthronement, Gregory began a campaign to invigorate the patriarchate. He gave special attention to the improvement of education, including schools and especially that of Balamand Monastery. He founded the Al-Ni‚Äômah magazine which became the official publication of the Patriarchate. His efforts included renovation of the Patriarchate, including church property, and filling vacant archbishoprics with qualified archbishops. A highlight of his patriarchate was an official invitation from Tsar Nicholas II of Russia asking him to preside over religious ceremonies starting March 6, 1913 in the capital of Russia, St. Petersburg, that marked the three hundred year anniversary of the rise of the Romanovs to power. On this occasion, Tsar Nicholas issued a statement which said: \\"Because of the strong historical relations which existed between our predecessors, the Tsars of Russia, and the patriarchs of Antioch, we have decided to extend an invitation to His Beatitude, Patriarch Gregory of Antioch to preside over the religious ceremonies which will begin on February 21, 1913 (os), commemorating three hundred years of Romanov rule in Russia.\\" Patriarch Gregory IV reposed on December 12, 1928.

Tatsu Hirota was born in Kyoto, Japan, where she lived until her death in 1990. Hirota is best known for her paintings of jinbutsu (figure painting). She is widely noted for her paintings of nudes and maiko girls.  Early life  Although she grew up in a very poor family, Hirota loved to paint as a child and by the age of 12 had decided that she wanted to become a painter. She began to pursue her ambition. After beginning her studies with one painter and feeling as though she wasn't learning much, she opted for a change. Hirota's second master was Kainosho Kusune, who later introduced her to Takeuchi Seih≈ç (1864-1942), Kyoto's most famous painter at the time, in the 1930s. Later Nishiyama Suish≈ç (1879-1958) began teaching her. During this time she met her husband-to-be, Kuma Mukai, who was also studying as a painter under Nishiyama. The couple had two children, a son, and a daughter.  Career  She exhibited and thrice won top prizes at the Nitten and Shin-Bunten. In 1974 she became a member of The Creative Painting Society, Soga-kai in 1974. Many museums in Japan house her works, with others in private collections. Hirota is largely credited for introducing the nude as art to the mainstream in Japan. Nudes were dismissed with disdain before that time. While Hirota was actively painting for some years prior, she completed her first nude piece, aptly titled Nude in 1951. Female subjects were the primary focus of her work and many of them in traditional Japanese dress with vibrant colors. From the 1970s until her death in 1990, she produced many works that were reproduced in art books, including one dedicated to only her works. She enjoyed painting maiko as well, and her improving talent and skill was evident in her work. Hirota loved to paint women like maiko as independent humans, not as accessories or as if they belonged to men. Any women she painted looks very attractive, vivacious and proud. She continued to paint up until a few days before her passing in 1990.

She has also written four articles for Scientific American. Haelle and Willingham's book, Informed Parent has received generally positive reviews from various book reviewers. According to noted vaccine researcher, Dr. Paul Offit, \\"In The Informed Parent, journalists Tara Haelle and Emily Willingham manage to answer everything a parent could possibly be worried about during pregnancy, birth, infancy, and toddlerhood. What makes this book different from every other book on this subject (and there are many) is that the authors take on not only the science of what concerns us, but encourage us to think along with them‚Äîgiving us the tools to answer other questions in the future. It was like reading the answer sheet before the test.\\" Haelle co-authored a paper that examined the effects of images in vaccine newspaper and magazine articles. It found that one in eight articles had negative images of vaccines. Blogs She is a writer at Forbes.com, Everyday Health, and numerous other websites. Haelle blogs about science, child rearing, childbirth, and vaccines at Forbes and Red Wine and Applesauce.

It is on the southern bank of the Yenisei River along the Sayano-Shushenskoye reservoir. The reserve thus protects a large section of the wooded, mountainous territory above the reservoir created by the Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam, the largest power plant in Russia. Both the reserve and the dam were established 1976, and a major purpose of the reserve besides conservation is the study of the ecological effects of a large reservoir on the local ecology. The reserve covers an area of . It is situated in the Shushensky District of Krasnoyarsk Krai. Topography The Sayano- Shushenski Reserve covers mountainous terrain on the axial ridge of the western Sayan mountains, including the Khemchiksky Ridge (northern slope) and Kantegirsky range (eastern spurs). It is bounded on the north by the Yenisei River. Elevations range from 500 to 2735 meters. Climate and Ecoregion Sayano-Shushenski is located in the Sayan montane conifer forests ecoregion, an ecoregion that is at the mid-elevation levels of the Sayan Mountains, the highest mountains in Siberia. It is in a transition zone between the Siberian taiga to the north and the Mongolian steppe to the south. This ecoregion has high levels of biodiversity due to the meeting of ecological zones, the variations in altitude, and the variations in relief. The climate of Sayano- Shushenski is Subarctic climate, without dry season (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate (Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1-3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). The Sayano Reserve experiences not only climate differences based on altitude, but across the line of the ranges: the north slope is wet (1000-1500 mm/year of precipitation), while the southern steppe side averages only 400 mm/year. The north slope may see 1.5 meters of snow while the southern sees 0.3 meters. Flora and fauna The forests of the reserve vary by elevation and by proximity to the reservoir. The mid-level forests are mostly taiga fir and pine, with some zones of larch forests. The mountain steppe regions grade out to even shrubs-steppe and grassland. Fluctuations in the water level due to operations of the dam can be dramatic (up to 40 meters). This leads to plant zones that contain species that reflect the influence of human actions, and are a primary focus of scientists in the reserve. In the upper regions of the reservoir, the receding waters have produced broad floodplains. Yenisei River in the reserve. Note the banks of the river where water level fluctuates The most common mammals in the reserve are those that are widespread in Siberia: sable, squirrel, elk, wolf, wolverine, lynx and others. In the upper levels of the mountains there are typical Arctic species: arctic shrews and reindeer. In steppe region are more Mongolian-representative species: Siberian mountain goat, Pallas's cat, long-tailed hamster and the grey marmot. There a small number of snow leopards in the reserve. Over 100 species of birds are recorded. Those representative of the Siberian taiga include the Eurasian nuthatch, blue nightingale, nightingale whistler, nutcracker, Himalayan Cuckoo, and grouse. The bearded partridge is typical of the rocky steppe areas, and birds of prey such as ospreys, falcons and eagles are common throughout. Reptiles include copperhead snakes and adders; amphibians are represented by the moor frog and common toad. Ecoeducation and access As a strict nature reserve, the Sayano-Shushenski Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. The reserves maintains a nature museum that is open to the public, and there are two 'ecotourist' routes through the territory that are open to the public, but require these permits to be obtained in advance. The main office is in the city of Shushenskoye.

The Chandan and Vandan are adjacent forts. The trek to both the fort can easily be completed in a day.  Places of interest  The fort is in good condition. The main entrance gate is in ruins, There is a Gaus Pak Baba (Mebub-e-Subhani) Dargah, water cistern, and bastion on the fort. There is an old Shiva temple on the fort with two Linga sculpture. Every year in the month of Shravan there is a festival celebrated by nearby villages. The path to the fort passes through open area devoid of any vegetation. This fort has peculiar stone piled structure. The path on the fort passes between the piles. On the southern part of the fort are three rooms built in stone without any roof. They are believed to be store rooms. History According to the evidence from the manuscripts found written on copper plates, the Chandan and Vandan forts were built by King Bhoj-II of Shilahar Dynasty in 1191-1192. King Shivaji won these forts from Adilshah of Bijapur in 1673. However, according to the latest studies published by Akhil, Maharashtra Itihas Parishad and Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak mandal, the first fort captured by Chatrapati Shivaji is Chandan after he took oath at Raireshva. An old temple of shiva in Rohideshvar area in the village of raireshvar. It was under the control of the Marathas till 1689 after it passed in the hand of Moghuls.

He then tried writing, in particular by giving the lyrics of Coronis, pastorale h√©ro√Øque, presented by the Acad√©mie royale de musique, on 23 March 1691, to music composed by Theobaldo di Gatti. After marrying Claire Gamart in 1693, he was admitted by the credit of his wife's family, in several sub-farms (like a tax district in which he was tax collector), which brought him a considerable fortune. This helped him acquire a position in the King's Council, into which he was received on 18 September 1693. In this capacity, his name can be seen in the permission for publication of several books. Daniel-Paul was related to Samuel Chappuzeau. Daniel-Paul's father was Jacques Chappuzeau, sieur de Baug√©, who abjured Calvinism in 1685. Jacques was the son of Jehan Chappuzeau, Samuel's uncle. Daniel-Paul's family married into the French and Belgian nobility, and there are many living descendants. Although some sources say he died in 1739, there are several documents available which make it clear that he died in or before 1729, when his successor in the King's council was appointed.Paris (Paris, France)  12/1729 - 12/1729  AN Y4450 See from 1729-12-14 \\"Succession sous b√©n√©fice d'inventaire pour Paulin Louis, Claire Marguerite et Jeanne Louise CHAPPUZEAU de BAUGE, tous trois enfants de d√©funt Daniel Paul Chappuzeau de Baug√©, ecuyer\\"  Sources  * Antoine de L√©ris, Dictionnaire portatif, historique et litt√©raire des th√©√¢tres, t. 3, Paris, C.
