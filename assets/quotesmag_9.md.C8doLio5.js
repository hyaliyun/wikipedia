His major mathematical work, the rectification of the semicubical parabola, was carried out when he was aged nineteen, and was published by John Wallis. By carrying out the determination of arc lengths on a curve given algebraically, in other words by extending to algebraic curves generally with Cartesian geometry a basic concept from differential geometry, it represented a major advance in what would become infinitesimal calculus. His name also appears as Neil. Life Neile was born at Bishopsthorpe, the eldest son of Sir Paul Neile MP for Ripon and Newark. His grandfather was Richard Neile, the Archbishop of York. He entered Wadham College, Oxford as a gentleman-commoner in 1652, matriculating in 1655. He was taught by John Wilkins and Seth Ward. In 1657, he became a student at the Middle Temple. In the same year he gave his exact rectification of the semicubical parabola and communicated his discovery to William Brouncker, Christopher Wren and others connected with Gresham College. His demonstration was published by Wallis in De Cycloide (1659). The general formula for rectification by definite integral was in effect discovered by Hendrik van Heuraet in 1659. In 1673 Wallis asserted that Christiaan Huyghens, who was advancing his own claim to have influenced Heuraet, was also slighting the priority of Neile. http://www-groups.dcs.st- and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Heuraet.html Neile was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 January 1663 and a member of the council on 11 April 1666. He entered the debate on the theory of motion, as a critic of the empiricist stance of other members. His own theory of motion was held up from publication by unfavourable peer review by Wallis, in 1667; a revision was communicated to the society on 29 April 1669. Neile objected to Wren's 1668 work on collision as lacking discussion of causality: he asked for discussion of the nature of momentum. His own work was much influenced by ideas drawn from the De Corpore of Thomas Hobbes.Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article on Neile, pp. 602-3.Jon Parkin, Science, Religion and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's De Legibus Naturae (1999), pp. 136-7. He made astronomical observations with instruments erected on the roof of his father's residence, the ‚ÄúHill House‚Äù (later called Waltham Place) at White Waltham in Berkshire, where he died at the age of 32. A white marble monument in the parish church of White Waltham commemorates him and an inscribed slab in the floor marks his burial-place. He belonged to the privy council of King Charles II.

The resulting media attention rallied significant public support for the recovery of the sculpture. Although never recovered, the statue was recast by the foundry owner, Peter Kolliner, with some minor changes by Irving and was replaced in September 1996. The Larry sculpture is located at the corner of Swanston Street and Collins Street, Melbourne. Another notable commission is a large mosaic mural covering the Luna Palace building inside Melbourne's Luna Park. This large scale public artwork was commissioned for the centenary of Luna Park and took four years to complete.

Life Lacaba was born in Cagayan de Oro and lived there with his family until moving to Pateros, at the age of seven. After attending Ateneo de Manila University, he worked in a variety of fields: as a teacher, production hand, and stage actor. During this time, he also became deeply involved in labor movements, such as Panulat Para sa Kaunlaran ng Sambayanan (PAKSA), as well as leftist political groups like the New People's Army. A prolific diarist and writer, Jose Lacaba wrote of his brother Emmanuel, \\"When there was no more paper to write on, he would write on the backs of cigarette tinfoil.\\" As Emmanuel became more deeply involved with the New People's Army, and with other guerilla groups opposed to martial law under the Marcos dictatorship, he went deeper into the Philippines' underground, but his poems and stories continued to circulate and find wide readership. Lacaba, along with three other dissidents, was killed on March 18, 1976 in Tucaan Balaag, Asuncion, Davao del Norte by members of the Integrated Civilian Home Defense Forces. He had been set to go back shortly to the city for a new assignment that would have used his writing skills, and had agreed to write a script for director Lino Brocka once he got back there. He was 27 years old. Works Lacaba wrote the lyrics of \\"Awit ni Kuala\\", the song sung by Lolita Rodriguez in the classic Lino Brocka masterpiece 'Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang '. He also composed new revolutionary lyrics in Cebuano for some well-known folk songs. The poet Luis Francia included Lacaba's work in a portfolio of Filipino poems for the 45th Issue of BOMB. His work has been collected in two anthologies: Salvaged Poems (1986) and Salvaged Prose (1992).

The village is part of the parish of Appleby Magna, with the vicar based in Appleby. The population is included in the civil parish of Twycross. The village has traditionally, and historically, been known as \\"Norton\\": deriving from the Anglo-Saxon, meaning \\"North-Town\\"; with variable spellings including \\"Northton\\" and \\"Nortone\\". The village, however, was also known for a brief period in the 17th century as \\"Hoggs Norton\\". The village's current name was acquired to differentiate the village from the several others in the county named Norton. \\"Juxta\\" is Latin for \\"near\\", and Twycross is a small village approximately 2 miles southeast of Norton. History The village of Norton is thought to have been founded in the 8th or 9th century by the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxon King √Üthelred granted the village a charter in 951, referring to it as \\"Northton\\" The village is listed in the Domesday Book as \\"Norton\\", and the Lord of the Manor was recorded in both 1066 and 1086 as Countess (Lady) Godiva, widow of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, famed (legendarily) for riding naked around the streets of Coventry. In both 1066 and 1086 the village is recorded as worth ¬£0.3. The village is listed as a very small settlement, with only four households, but has a quite large taxable value of 6 geld units. The Domesday Book records the village as home to 1 villager, 2 small holders and a priest, and is recorded as having land for 7 ploughs and 8 acres of meadow. In 1325 several people in Norton were arrested for the murder of Sir William de Monte Gomeri, which took place near to Merevale Abbey. Philippa, widow of the murdered Sir William, said that it was in the manor house at Norton, belonging to Walter de Monte Gomeri(unclear how they are related; may have been brother of deceased), that Robert de Gresley had sent his brother Peter to kill her husband.'Plea Rolls for Staffordshire: 18 Edward II', Staffordshire Historical Collections, vol. 10, part 1 (1889), pp. 57-62. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=52344 Date accessed: 6 June 2013 He was struck over the head by a sword, and died in Phillipa's arms. Philippa accused Joan, wife of Walter de Monte Gomeri of also being present at Norton Manor during that meeting, and of \\"aiding, abetting and procuring the death of her husband\\". Robert and Joan appeared before the County Court and were transferred for trial at the Court of King's Bench. Both stated they were not guilty but only Joan was given bail until the trial. The jury of their trial returned a not guilty verdict for the pair. Peter de Greseleye and another supposed accomplice William de Northfolk, both failed to appear before the County Court and were declared outlaws. Norton was previously an independent parish, however, by 1839 was recorded as a chapelry within the parish of Orton on the Hill. It is currently within the parish of Appleby Magna. Holy Trinity Church Holy Trinity Church c. 1791, before the spire was demolished The Village's parish church is dedicated to The Holy Trinity. The original church was built of wood in the 12th century, and the village acquiring its first rector in 1220, whilst the church's Advowson was under the control of Belvoir Priory. The church seen today was built in the early 14th century, although it was heavily restored around 1841. The tower formerly had a small spire, but this was dismantled in 1890 as it had become unsafe. The tower had also originally contained 3 bells: 1640 and the other two in 1663. One, however, was recast in 1849. The tower's clock was made by Samuel Deacon's company in Barton in the Beans. It was installed on 1 September 1840, having cost ¬£80. The church vesty was built in 1850 and cost ¬£100 to construct. The church is unusual in having two pulpits. The church's Gothic style barrel organ was built in 1819, in London, by James Butler: an apprentice of George England. It was installed within the church in 1840 and restored in 1980, by John Burns of Nuneaton In 1829, on the appointment of the Hon. Alfred Curzon as rector, the parish is revealed to have an annual income of ¬£332 9s. 11¬ºd; ¬£200 of which came from the rental of the church's Glebe lands and the rental of part of the parsonage house. =Rectors= Rectors of Holy Trinity Church, Norton:John Nichols‚Äô, History and Antiquities of Leicestershire, Vol. 4, Pt. 2. pp 849-852 (incomplete) *Ralph de Querendon, - (resigned 1329) *William de Lobenham, - (1329 - ) Subdean of Sarum *Robert Bytham, - (resigned 1421) *Thomas Farmer, - (c. 1564) *Thomas Royle, - (died 1609) *Gabriel Rosse, - (1609 - 1658) *Josiah Whiston, - (1661 - 1685) *Theophilus Brookes, - (died 1711) *Reubens Clarke, - (1711 - 1728) *Lancelot Jackson, - (1728 - 1745) *John Clayton, - (31 May 1745 - 1791) *William Carson, - (27 June 1796 - April 1811) *The Hon.

Reverend William Carsons (tenure 1746-1811) attempted to under take repairs, but they were not completed. When The Hon. Alfred Curzon (son of Nathaniel Curzon, 2nd Baron Scarsdale) took over the position of rector in 1829, the house was still unsuitable. Curzon (who had gained his position through family connections to the local land owner, the Earl Howe) chose to reside instead in a house near to his birthplace at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire (over 27 miles away): his duties as priest fulfilled by a curate from the neighbouring parish of Appleby Magna. This lack of occupation is probably the cause of the rectory's ongoing dilapidation, which was confirmed again in 1835 when the Rectory was described as being in \\"a bad and dangerous state\\". In 1842 the then Rector, Andrew Bloxham, applied to receive Queen Anne's Bounty in order to repair the rectory. Plans to rebuild were obviously abandoned when in 1850 reverend William Thomas Pearce Mead King constructed a new vicarage to the South-West of the village. The old rectory and outbuildings still remained until at least 1887, however, when they were being used as a farm. Pearce Mead King's new construction served as the village's rectory until Norton joined Appleby Magna Parish, at which point it became a private residence, known as Norton Grange. In 1963 Norton Grange and its 12-acre gardens, were purchased for ¬£12,000 by zoologist Molly Badham, who founded Twycross Zoo (at first known as The East Midlands Zoological Society) in the rectory's gardens. Molly and the Zoo are famed for her work training Chimps, most notably for use in the PG Tips Tea Television advertisements which ran from the 1960s to the 1980s. Population The Hearth tax reveals there were 16 families living in the village in 1564 and a total of 40 inhabitants were charged the tax in 1664. In 1829 the parish of Norton is revealed to have had a population of 301; with an additional 74 living in an exclave of the parish at Bilston.

Chevron Access Needed for Richmond Bay Trail Link, by Genevi√®ve Duboscq, The Berkeley Daily Planet, 27-03-2007, access date 06-04-2009 It is owned and operated by Chevron Corporation and employs more than 1,200 workers, making it the city's largest employer. The refinery processes approximately of crude oil a day in the manufacture of petroleum products and other chemicals. The refinery's primary products are motor gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel and lubricants.What We Do: The Refining Process , Chevron website, access date 05-16-2009 History  Beginnings  The refinery was established several years before the City of Richmond was incorporated in 1905. Construction on the refinery began in 1901 between the Potrero Hills and the marshlands in the Point Richmond District; the refinery was opened in 1902.The Early Years 1902 - 1914 , Chevron website, access date 02-19-2009 The refinery was built by Standard Oil and its first headquarters was in an abandoned farm house at the former site of the Peters and Silva Farms.Chevron Beginnings: W.S. Rheem, by Nilda Rego, Contra Costa Times, 01-18-2009, access date 02-19-2009 The complex was described as \\"colossal\\" at the time and to this day it remains a very large complex of its kind. In its first year of operation the plant could process of oil per day and had a tankage capacity of in that same first year. William Rheem played a key role in the facility's construction and implementation, being the project manager and the installation's first superintendent. Furthermore, Rheem continued on to be a key and historic civic figure in the City of Richmond. The presence of the burgeoning refinery transformed the small town of Richmond from a rural agricultural community with 200 residents to a company town of several thousand within a few years. Chevron oil tanker (Mississippi Voyager) Crude oil is delivered by, and refined products distributed by, oil tankers using a long wharf extending into San Francisco Bay. Pipe lines connect the wharf to the refinery; and a parallel narrow gauge electric railway was built to transport packaged goods, shipboard supplies and personnel. The refinery shops built six power cars and three unpowered trailers for use under of overhead line. Trolley operation began in 1905 serving a shipside hotel, ship chandlery, shook factory, barrel works, and some refinery administration offices. The trolley line was replaced by trucks and buses in 1948.  Growth  The number of passenger cars in the United States rose from 1.6 million to 5.6 million from 1914 to 1918. Motor trucks, farm tractors, and aircraft all increased at a comparable rate. As a result, the demand for gasoline, lubricants and other petroleum products intensified.Growth Through Research and Innovation 1915 - 1945 , Chevron website, access date 05-16-2009 The Richmond refinery was in an excellent position with its plentiful crude oil, state-of-art equipment and prime location to capitalize on the increased demand for petroleum products on the West Coast. By 1915, the refinery spread across , employed 1,700 workers, and had a capacity of a day. Not only did the refinery produce transportation fuels, it also had a grease plant, an asphaltum plant, a can factory, a barrel works, a machine shop and a tank car repair shop. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the Richmond refinery became a critical producer of fuel for trucks, tankers, trains, and planes in the war effort. Historian Gerald White reported that the \\"high quality of the medicinal white oil developed at Richmond to take the place of Russian white oil, cut off by the war, caused an executive of E.R. Squibb & Sons to comment that the Richmond product was 'superior to the best oil' ever imported.\\" At the end of the war the company shifted its focus back to basic product research and in 1919 constructed a well-equipped red brick laboratory building that still stands today. Development manager Ralph A. Halloran's emphasis on centralized, systematic research helped the department gain greater prestige in support of the company's tenet, \\"Research First - Then Advertising,\\" which ensured that a product was thoroughly tested before being introduced to the public. By 1924, the laboratory's staff grew to 75 skilled employees, who engaged in tests and experiments, not only to develop new uses for petroleum, but to improve existing processes. In 1938 the refinery constructed a new Hydro Plant for the production of synthetic aviation gasoline. It was the first in the Western United States to produce synthetic gasoline by combining purified hydrogen gas with an unsaturated gas by-product from gasoline cracking operations. With the onset of World War II the refinery saw major changes. Many employees left for service in the U.S. military and close to 400 women joined the refinery workforce. The refinery shifted production to high-octane fuel and other products to meet military needs. In 1943 a toluene plant was constructed to supply the key ingredient for TNT and later, at the request of the U.S. military, was converted to production of 100-octane gasoline. The U.S. Secretaries of War and Navy and the Petroleum Administrator commended the refinery for exceeding the production of aviation gasoline requested by the government. In 1945, the Richmond refinery won its fifth U.S. Army-Navy \\"E\\" award for its support of the military effort.  Present Day Refinery  Chevron Richmond Refinery, August 2017  Modernization  A protest to modernization that would allow for refining of more polluting high sulphur crude Following the end of World War II, the refinery began a long-range modernization and expansion of its facilities to accommodate the new post-war consumer demands for petroleum products. The refinery constructed units that increased production of highly refined products for the postwar generation of higher-compression engines. In 1951, a residuum stripper was constructed to convert heavy residual fuel oil into lighter products. In 1959, the company made a major breakthrough when it developed the Isocracking process which uses catalysts to rearrange the existing molecules of heavy fuel oils to remove sulfur and convert low-value fuel oils into higher-yield products such as gasoline. The company also completed a new fluid catalytic cracking unit capable of processing daily of feed stock, further adding to the high-octane gasolines being demanded in rapidly increasing quantities by modern, high-compression automobile engines. In 1965, a breakthrough came when the Richmond refinery opened the world's largest Isomax hydrocracking complex. The unit converts heavy petroleum oils to lighter stocks for gasoline and other higher valued products. The -a-day unit increased the plant's gasoline output by 40%. A solvent de-asphalting plant and a hydrogen manufacturing plant were also constructed to support the Isomax and were the largest of their kind ever constructed.Fueling the Peace and Protecting the Environment 1946 - 1970 , Chevron website, access date 02-19-2009 The post-war years were also marked by a dramatic increase in demand for petrochemicals to serve as the building blocks for hundreds of essential consumer products. In 1951, a new unit was constructed to manufacture paraxylene, a basic material used for making synthetic fibers, and was the first of its kind to produce the chemical from petroleum. The West Coast's first phenol plant was completed in 1954 for the production of lubricating oil and lubricating oil additive, resins and plastic, and plywood adhesives. A year later, another chemical plant for the manufacture of isophthalic was constructed, the first in the US. Isophthalic is a chemical intermediate used in plastics and surface coatings. In 1960, construction began on a $17 million complex for production of para- and orthoxylenes, important chemical intermediates, at the Richmond refinery. Another major project increased the capacity for production of alpha olefins, used extensively in the manufacture of \\"soft\\" detergents, lubricant additives, plastics and plasticizers. None of these chemical plants are still in operation today except for the alpha olefin plant, which produces an intermediate chemical for the production of Techron, Chevron's gasoline additive.  Recent history  During the 1970s and 1980s as the dynamics of the United States petroleum industry were changing, the refinery was transformed to produce higher-value, higher-volume fuels and lubricating oils and to comply with increasingly stringent state and federal policies. These policies called for the refinery to reduce air emissions and waste, treat water, and prevent oil spills. In order to comply with federal mandates for reduced-lead gasoline the refinery installed reforming units in 1971 to produce higher octane gasoline material. In 1975, the refinery added a desulfurization unit for the production of low-sulfur fuel oil, primarily to supply the growing needs of California electric utility companies. The expansion was also designed to process greater quantities of high-sulfur crudes and products that met environmental specifications. During the expansion the refinery also built two storage tanks, the largest in the United States, to receive marine cargos.Building a World-class Organization 1971 - Present , Chevron website, access date 05-16-2009 In 1979, a worldwide shortage of crude oil, along with a shift in the availability of quality crudes, presented challenges to manufacturing operations. Chevron invested in the Richmond refinery, improving their flexibility for handling different types of crude oil, responding to changing product standards, installing energy conservation equipment, and complying with environmental or regulatory requirements. A $17 million direct digital computer control system was first installed in the Isomax plant, and later expanded to include all plants. This enabled the refinery to produce higher-grade products and reduce energy consumption. In 1984, the construction of a major lubricating oil manufacturing plant increased Richmond's lube oil base-stock output from 3,800 to a day, using hydrocracking and hydrorefining processes developed by Chevron Research. Later, in 1993, a major research breakthrough occurred when Chevron introduced Isodewaxing technology. This new technique maximized the production of high quality base oils while co-producing high-value light products and allowed for the economical production of base oils that meet specifications calling for lighter-viscosity lubricant grades. During the 1990s the refinery began producing Chevron Plus Unleaded gasoline, which replaced regular leaded gasoline in California in 1992. Methyl tert-butyl ether, or MTBE, was added as an oxygenate and to raise the octane number. However, MTBE was found to contaminate groundwater, and in 2004 was replaced with ethanol.Methyl tert- butyl ether, wikipedia, access date 05-16-2009 In 2001 former vice mayor and councilman John M√°rquez stated that he did not think that the refinery's numerous toxic spills were intentional.Richmond Debates Building Its Own Power Plant at the Chevron Refinery, Jennifer Barrios, 25-05-2001, access date 21-04-2012 He also stated that he thought the refinery was safe. He received campaign funding from BAPAC, that was backed by a $1,500 from Chevron Corporation. Marquez also opposed measure T and the 16,000,000 dollars that it would bring the city from large industries like Chevron. In 2002, the 100th anniversary of the Richmond refinery, the plant had over 1,300 employees, covered 2,900 acres, operated 30 plants, and had the ability to move per day of raw materials and finished products across its long wharf. By 2006, the refinery had a capacity of a day and processed more crude oil than any other plant in the Bay Area and ranked among the major refineries in the U.S. In March 2014, the company launched a website to provide Richmond-area community news.San Francisco Chronicle Incidents 1989 explosion and fire On April 10, 1989, an explosion and fire occurred in a cracking column at the refinery. A total of 8 workers and firefighters were injured. Three workers suffered second and third degree burns. As a result, in September 1989 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Chevron $877,000 for \\"willfully failing to provide protective equipment for employees.\\" Chevron employees had \\"repeatedly requested\\" protective equipment since the early 1980s but the company had refused despite more than 70 fires in the plant since 1984. Elizabeth Dole, the US Secretary of Labor, said: \\"OSHA's investigation makes clear that Chevron knew of the need for protective equipment and clothing for employees who, though not assigned to the fire brigade, were responsible for assisting firefighters in their unit.\\" Chevron lodged notices of contest against the penalties but in 1991 agreed to pay the U.S. Department of Labor $275,000 \\"in full financial settlement.\\" 1999 explosion and fire On March 25, 1999, there was an explosion and fire at the refinery that spread noxious fumes and sent hundreds of Richmond residents to hospitals. After the 1999 explosion, residue was left in nearby water sources and soil which affected many nearby residents. The explosion accidentally sent out sulfuric gases into the air, affecting many nearby communities. A \\"shelter in place\\" advisory was issued, but proved ineffective because many residents were non-English speakers and were not able to get the adequate info through local media or the English only safety procedures that were announced. Chevron and county health services lacked consistence of informing the residents about the importance to \\"shelter in place\\" in order to avoid inhalation of the harmful chemicals (over 200 chemicals) that were leaking into the communities. 2012 fire 2012 fire seen from the Tiburon Peninsula On August 6, 2012, a large fire erupted at the refinery at about 6:15 PM and reported to be contained at 10:40 PM. Flames were seen issuing from at least two of the refinery's towers. Contra Costa Health Services responded by notifying residents shelter in place. BART shut down local service. Justin Berton, Kevin Fagan and Vivian Ho, \\"Fire at Chevron refinery in Richmond: East Bay residents told to stay inside as thick smoke spews into sky from Chevron plant\\", SFGate, San Francisco Chronicle on line (August 7, 2012). The shelter-in-place order was lifted at 11:15 PM. Initial reports estimated that 11,000 people sought treatment at area hospitals,Chevron refinery fire a 'close call', Jaxon Van Derbeken, San Francisco Chronicle, 20-08-2012, access date 21-08-2012 and later reports placed the number above 15,000 people. Six employees that were present at the scene of the fire suffered varying degrees of injury. Employee 1 received a minor burn to a small area on the left ear, Employee 2 suffered a small burn to the left wrist, Employee 3 suffered from abdominal discomfort. Employee 4's respiratory pathway was irritated, Employee 5 suffered blistering to the right leg from boot wear, and Employee 6 had a bruised finger. All of the injured employees were given on site medical treatment by the Chevron Fire Department and other on site medical staff. A refinery spokeswoman stated that the fire erupted in the number 4 crude distillation unit, or CDU. Just before 6:30 p.m., an inspection crew discovered that there was a diesel leak in a line in the CDU‚Äîand that the leak was growing. The crew evacuated the area just before the diesel ignited, said Nigel Hearne, manager of the refinery. Three refinery workers were given first aid at the refinery. On April 15, 2013, the US Chemical Safety Board released their preliminary report citing Chevron for a chronic failure to replace aging equipment and called for an overhaul of regulatory oversight of the industry to prevent such accidents from happening again. In January 2015, the CSB released their final investigation report. Analysts predicted that the fire would cause an increase in gasoline prices in the western United States. A Chevron spokesperson later said that the fire was one factor among others, including the price of crude oil, that influenced prices. However, data collected by the California Energy Commission showed that increased production at other refineries more than made up for the Richmond loss, with 461,000 gallons of crude oil added to state refinery production during the week of August 3 through August 10, 2012. In 2013, the company pleaded no contest to six charges in connection with the fire, and agreed to pay $2 million in fines and restitution. On the first anniversary of the fire, 210 people were arrested while marching to protest safety issues at the refinery. Around the same time the settlement was announced, the Richmond city council voted to file suit against Chevron. The reasons for the suit included \\"a continuation of years of neglect, lax oversight and corporate indifference to necessary safety inspection and repairs.\\"  2014 incident  On December 18, 2014, a flare event occurred. It was described by local television station KGO-TV channel 7 as a \\"large flare is producing flames\\".  2016 incident  On September 3, 2016, black smoke could be seen coming from the refinery. NBC Bay Area reported that this was due to flaring.m 2019-20 incidents KGO, local news station, counted a total of 38 flaring incidents in 2019. Most directly related to unexpected system upsets, per Chevron spokesperson. Residents are not informed. August 2020 Kron4 reported about the large cloud of black smoke, visible from San Francisco.  Environmental record   Source of crude  This refinery receives small quantities (relative to their other sources) of crude oil from the Amazon region of South America, according to the Borealis Centre for Environmental and Trade Research.  Air quality monitoring  Chevron is currently implementing an Air Quality Monitoring program in the surrounding neighborhoods of North Richmond, Point Richmond and Atchison Village. This program is part of the Richmond Community Benefits Agreement (RCBA, Section 2.F(2))Charter Document for the Richmond Community Benefits Advisory Committee, Richmond Community Benefits Advisory Committee, access date 05-16-2009 for the Chevron Energy and Hydrogen Renewal Project. The Air Quality Monitoring Program will sample air quality using testing methods similar to those used by government agencies and publish these results on a community-accessible website.Neighborhood Air Quality Monitoring , Chevron website, access date 05-16-2009 Some citizens routinely patrol the area with air collection bins to measure the chemical content of the air.Taking the Toxic Tour , Common Ground Magazine (note: contains inaccuracies), access date 05-16-2009 Castro Cove Between 1902 and 1987 the refinery released noxious chemicals into the surrounding environment with impunity.Castro Cove/Chevron Richmond, CA , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), retrieved August 1, 2007 This came in the form of contaminated process water from the industrial facilities of the complex. There are unhealthy levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and mercury in the estuarine habitats of Castro Cove and the San Pablo Creek Marsh adjacent to the refinery's runoff from their waste water outfall. The water is highly toxic to wildlife and is too polluted for fishing, swimming, or wading. Since 1987 the refinery has reduced the impact of discharged process water by improving water treatment to reduce contaminants, including metals, by approximately 80 percent and reducing the amount of treated water discharged from to . Additionally, in 1987 the refinery completed the deepwater discharge project moving the effluent discharge point from Castro Cove to deep water in San Pablo Bay to provide for greater dilution of remaining contaminants and minimize the impact on water quality.Protecting Water Quality , Chevron website, access date 05-16-2009 In 2007 and 2008, Chevron engaged in a clean- up operation of the cove that cost between $20 and $30 million after being ordered to do so by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board's Bay Protection and Toxic Clean-up Program (which found Chevron liable for an additional $2.85 million in \\"natural resources damages.\\") Controversies  Tax rates  In 2006 a local referendum (Measure T) proposed to raise the business tax. Chevron vehemently opposed the initiative and funded a massive flyer campaign, suggesting it would lead to evictions of seniors and closing of small businesses.Historic local victory points the way forward , by Bob Patenaude, People's Weekly World Newspaper, 19-02-2009, access date 19-02-2009 The measure failed by 54%. However, in 2008 the measure was revived, modified to tax only large manufacturers; it passed by 51.5%. Unpaid taxes In 2009 the Chevron refinery agreed to pay the city of Richmond $28 million in back utility taxes.Chevron, Richmond Strike $28 Million Deal for Refinery Utility Taxes, by Katherine Tam, Oakland Tribune, 18-02-2009, access date 19-02-2009 In 2011 Chevron unsuccessfully sued Contra Costa County for 73 million dollars claiming its property taxes were too high.Protesters descend on Chevron tax hearings, Robert Rogers, Richmond Confidential, 15-12-2011, access date 25-12-2011 The company's lawyers stated that the refinery was not worth $3 billion in 2007 and 2009 as assessed, but instead only worth $1.8 and $1.15 billion respectively. During the hearings, Gayle McLaughlin, Mayor of Richmond, stated \\"If Chevron wins this appeal, it will mean layoffs, major cutbacks in services and would push us virtually to the edge of bankruptcy. Cities are suffering and Chevron is making billions of dollars.\\" Kevin Lally, attorney acting for Richmond during the appeal, stated that Chevron had manipulated data, refused to give the assessor's staff necessary information, and falsely characterized the nature of the county's assessment process, stating that Chevron's analysis was \\"fraught with materials that don‚Äôt satisfy evidentiary standards.‚Äù Around fifty protestors organized by the Richmond Progressive Alliance including Mayor McLaughlin and city council member Jovanka Beckels protested at the hearings, silently holding signs. The Assessment Appeals Board eventually found against Chevron's appeal, found that the county assessor had actually undervalued Chevron's refinery, and ordered Chevron to pay an additional $26.7 million in taxes, rather than receiving the $73 million refund Chevron sought. Bay Trail A portion of the San Francisco Bay Trail from Point Molate through to Point San Pablo crosses oil pipelines that connect the Chevron refinery with the Richmond Long Wharf.Richmond Commits to Funding for Bay Trail at Refinery, by Katerine Tam, Oakland Tribune, 01-28-2009, access date 14-04-2014 Chevron opposed the construction of this segment of the Bay Trail, citing security concerns, and stating that post-September 11 security requirements posed an issue. Supporters of the Bay Trail along with then California Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi pushed Chevron into accepting the construction of the Bay Trail in exchange for allowing the company to renew its 30-year lease on state tidelands that lie at the site of its port. In addition, the Richmond city council passed a resolution 8-1 directing mayor Gayle McLaughlin to ask the California State Land Use Commission to persuade Chevron to permit the trail. Chevron claimed that its total commitment in the Bay Trail amounted to $12.5 million, with $3 million being taken from Chevron's backtaxes, and $7.5 million worth of land being committed to the project. A Chevron spokesperson stated that these numbers had been arrived at using Chevron assessors. Bruce Beyaert, head of the Trails for Richmond Action Committee (and former Chevron environmental executive) disagreed with Chevron's stated figures, saying that they were heavily inflated and amounted to \\"smoke and mirrors.\\" Beyaert pointed to a 2001 joint trail study finding the trail easement south of I-580 worth $280,000, not the three million dollars Chevron assessed it at. Beyaert also states that there had previously been discussions to give land north of I-580 for free under an East Bay rails to trails project, land which Chevron's internal assessors valued at $4.5 million upon agreeing to the Bay Trail's construction. The portion of the trail in question has since been completed. Trade Secrets In September 2014, the proponents of 1st Amendment free speech have argued against the bill SB130 allowing Chevron to maintain a degree of trade secrets that was said to have a potential to compromise operational safety.

It consists of a shallow metal casing or paila (cookware of Catalan origin; in Catalan language it is called paella), with a single-headed drum. Paila criolla was initially used by street bands in the 19th century. They are shallower in shape than single-headed tom- toms, and come in double sets, tuned an octave apart. The player (known as a timbalero) uses a variety of stick strokes, rim shots, and rolls on the skins to produce a wide range of percussive expression during solos and at transitional sections of music, and usually plays the shells of the drum or auxiliary percussion such as a cowbell (cencerro). Pailas are always hit with straight batonsthicker than standard drumsticks, and not shaped: they are of uniform thickness along the length. that have no additional head. Hits are made on the top and on the metal sides. The shells are referred to as c√°scara (the Spanish word for shell) which is also the name of a rhythmic pattern common in Cuban music that is played on the shells of the pailas to keep time. The shells are made of metal. The heads are light and tuned fairly high for their size.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana: biogr√°fico y t√©cnico. Entries for Paila criolla; Timbal criolla. Pailas are now often called timbales, but the term timbales is ambiguous, because it was also used to describe kettle drums.  History of the term in Cuba  Although the term timbal or timbales (pl.) is often used now to mean pailas, there is a problem with this usage, because timbal has been used in Cuba for two quite different types of drum. In the first place, it was first used to describe the kettle drums used in the wind orchestras known as Orquesta t√≠pica.see examples in Early Cuban bands. These were the same general type of drum used in military bands, perhaps slung either side of a horse, and in classical orchestras. These were, and are, played with sticks which have softish round heads. The orquestas t√≠picas were gradually replaced early in the 20th century by charangas. The general idea of the charanga was to replace the wind instruments with violins and flute to bring a brighter, lighter tone to the band. The typani were replaced by pailas criollas, which because of their light weight were originally used by street bands. Pailas were taken over by the early charangas; their original name is still used in Cuba, but over time the familiar term timbal has been taken over to describe the pailas. There is often a second set of even smaller drums, timbalitos (= pailitas), which produce an even higher note when struck. In a modern band the timbalero may also have a trap kit as an alternate for certain numbers.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana: biogr√°fico y t√©cnico. Entries for Paila criolla; Timbal criolla; T√≠pica (orquesta); Charanga. Thus the term timbales is ambiguous, particularly when referring to bands playing the danz√≥n in the 1900-1930 period. If one does not have a photograph it is difficult to know which type of drum was used by the band.

He worked in France and Germany. Biography He was born in Paris, the son of L√©on Godefroy, lord of Guignecourt. He was educated at the Coll√®ge de Navarre, and studied law at Louvain, Cologne, and Heidelberg, returning to Paris in 1573. He embraced the reformed religion, and in 1579 left Paris, where his abilities and connections promised a brilliant career, to establish himself at Geneva. He became professor of law there, received the freedom of the city in 1580 and in 1587 became a member of the Council of the Two Hundred. Henry IV of France induced him to return to France by making him grand bailli of Gex, but no sooner had he installed himself than the town was sacked and his library burnt by the troops of the duke of Savoy. In 1591 he became professor of Roman law at Strassburg, where he remained until April 1600, when in response to an invitation from Frederick IV, Elector Palatine, he moved to Heidelberg. The difficulties of his position led to his return to Strassburg for a short time, but in November 1604 he definitely settled at Heidelberg. He was made head of the faculty of law in the university, and was from time to time employed on missions to the French court. His repeated refusal of offers of advancement in his own country was due to his Calvinism. He died at Strassburg, having left Heidelberg before the city was sacked by the imperial troops in 1621. Works His most important work was the new edition of Corpus juris civilis, originally published at Geneva in 1583, which went through some twenty editions, the most valuable of them being that printed by the Elzevirs at Amsterdam in 1633 and the Leipzig edition of 1740. Lists of his other learned works may be found in Senebier's Hist. litt. de Gen√®ve, vol. ii., and in Nic√©ron's M√©moires, vol. xvii. Some of his correspondence with his learned friends, with his kinsman President de Thou, Isaac Casaubon, Jean Jacques Grynaeus, and others, is preserved in the libraries of the British Museum, of Basel and Paris.

In 1960, he graduated in Russian Studies at the University of Birmingham, before qualifying as a teacher at the London Institute of Education. In 1963, Riordan studied at the Communist higher party school in Moscow; he was an avowed Communist, and was one of the few English students at the school. His autobiography Comrade Jim: The Spy Who Played for Spartak includes an account of his games for Spartak Moscow; some Russian commentators have questioned these claims. When he returned to England he became lecturer at Bradford University before moving on to the University of Surrey at Guildford where became head of the Russian Department and was awarded a personal professorship. In 1980, he was the Olympic attache for the British Olympic Association of the 1980 Moscow Olympics.

Junack, \\"Kurzgefasste Liste der griechischen Handschriften des Neues Testaments\\", Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York 1994, p. 60. It has marginalia.  Description  The codex contains the text of the both Testaments, on 623 parchment leaves (size ), with some lacunae (Rev. 13:5-14:8; 15:7-17:2; 18:10-19:15; 20:7-22:21). The text is written in two columns per page, 50-52 lines per page. The text of New Testament is on leaves 486-623. The order of books: Acts, Catholic epistles, Pauline epistles. Epistle to the Hebrews is placed between 2 Thessalonians and 1 Timothy. The text is divided according to the (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their (titles of chapters) at the top of the pages. The text of the Gospels has also another division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections, but without references to the Eusebian Canons. It contains tables of the (tables of contents) before each book, subscriptions at the end of each book, the Euthalian Apparatus (in Acts, Cath., and Paul), the Eusebian Canons absent.  Text  The Greek text of the New Testament of this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type (except epistles). Aland placed it in Category III in the Catholic and Pauline epistles and in Category V in rest of New Testament books. It contains many peculiar readings. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents textual family Kx in Luke 1 and Luke 20. In Luke 10 no profile was made. It creates textual cluster with minuscule 187.

It does so by preventing process A from writing to process B. Process isolation can be implemented with virtual address space, where process A's address space is different from process B's address space ‚Äì preventing A from writing onto B. Security is easier to enforce by disallowing inter-process memory access, in contrast with less secure architectures such as DOS in which any process can write to any memory in any other process.All in one CISSP Exam Guide, 3rd Edition, Shon Harris  Limited inter-process communication  In a system with process isolation, limited (controlled) interaction between processes may still be allowed over inter-process communication (IPC) channels such as shared memory, local sockets or Internet sockets. In this scheme, all of the process' memory is isolated from other processes except where the process is allowing input from collaborating processes. System policies may disallow IPC in some circumstances. For example, in mandatory access control systems, subjects with different sensitivity levels may not be allowed to communicate with each other. The security implications in these circumstances are broad and span applications in network key encryption systematics as well as distributed caching algorithms. Interface-defined protocols such as basic cloud access architecture and network sharing are similarly affected.

(KUMZ) is one of the town-forming enterprises of Kamensk-Uralsky, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia. KUMZ was founded especially for supplying of aerospace industry with semi-finished products in aluminium and magnesium alloys. Currently, the plant produces aluminium alloy billets, forged and rolled plates, roll bond heat exchangers, extruded rods, bars, tubes, drill pipes, profiles, die-forgings. History Central pass- through of KUMZ Main office building The History of KUMZ starts with Decision of Government of the Soviet Union No. 513-99C dated June 3 of year 1939 regarding building of the Works No. 268 for magnesium alloy products. The construction started in May 1940. During World War II the plant has received casting and rolling production equipment of Stupino metallurgical works evacuated from Moscow region. First aluminium alloy slabs were produced in February 1942. First forged and extruded products were produced in the autumn of 1943. On May 5, 1944 in Pravda newspaper the report about the launch of the plant was published. This date is considered as birthday of the KUMZ. In 1945 new equipment for rolling production was installed. In 1949 KUMZ began the production of aluminium cookware. In the 1950s the plant increased its production capacity and products range. New workshops were built: forging- extrusion (1951), casting (1958), extrusion (1959). In 1958 KUMZ has made first export delivery which included 2952 metric tons of aluminium alloy rolled products. In the same year for the first time magnesium rolled products were produced. While initial production of aluminium alloy light weight drill pipes started at KUMZ in the 1950s. In 1972 KUMZ has built a new specially meant workshop. In March 1966 the first mechanized line for roll bond heat exchangers production was launched at the plant. From that moment KUMZ supports high quality household refrigerators production. On 8 July 1978 the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded to the plant the Order of the Red Banner of Labour for successful development of production and realization of new technologies. On November 30 of 1992 the plant was reorganized in Joint stock company. In December 2007 green-field project for heat treatment of plates was launched. In December 2011 KUMZ has entered in contracts for construction of new rolling mill complex comprising cold rolling mill, hot rolling mill and heat treatment of sheets. The total investments are estimated as 550 million euro. In May 2012 unique vertical 300 MN forging press was launched after modernization. Space programmes KUMZ takes part in all Russian (Vostok spacecraft, Voskhod spacecraft, Salyut program, Mir, Proton) and International space programs (International Space Station, Sea Launch). Production KUMZ main facilities are *Casting shop *Extruded tube production shop *Extrusion shop *Tool shop *Forging shop *Heat-exchanger production shop *Plate treatment shop *Rolling-mill shop *Research and development center Casting production The raw material for the shop are pure aluminium purchased from smelters, alloying components and aluminium scrap. KUMZ has a number of furnaces: electric, gas, coreless-type induction, electric vacuum holding; and equipment for cutting and scalping. This allows KUMZ to supply its own workshops with high quality wrought aluminium alloy billets, ingots, slabs produced in situ. About 70 aluminium alloys per Russian standards, more than 20 per international standards EN, DIN, ASTM and own Al- Li alloys are mastered. Rolling production KUMZ has one hot-rolling mill and two cold-rolling mills ‚ÄúQuarto‚Äù. Hot-rolling mill was recently modernized in several steps.Kamensk ‚Äî Uralsky Metallurgical completed modernisation of a hot rolling mill. December 15, 2004 The plant is one among few world producers of aluminium-lithium alloy sheets and plates. Beside the flat surface products tread plates and sheets are produced with diamond pattern by means of special rollers. Such product is used for floors of bus, trucks, rail cars, drill towers. In 2012 KUMZ installed water jet cutter. It allows pattern cutting of rectangular plates to blanks with desired complex shape. KUMZ Rolling production serves needs of aerospace industry. Specially treated aluminium plates and sheets are used by Boeing and Bombardier companies in their production of airplanes. The plant has a production line for aluminium roll bond heat exchangers which are used in household refrigerators and flat plate solar thermal collectors. Extrusion production KUMZ has 39 horizontal hydraulic extrusion presses with power from 500 to 12000 tons. They are situated in four buildings. With help of tools shop KUMZ produces more than 20000 kinds of aluminium profiles, 550 different sizes of bars and rods, 850 kinds of tubes. Forging production Forging production of KUMZ serves the needs of leading Russian design bureaus for passenger aircraft Tupolev, Ilyushin, Sukhoi, Yakovlev, Antonov. Equipment includes hydraulic vertical die-forging presses from 1250 to 30000 ton-force, hydraulic forging press with capacity of 6000 ton-force, radial ring forging press. 1500 items of die- forged products, 1200 items of forged products and 1600 types of rolled rings from 0.1 kg to 3000 kg are already available. Special production KUMZ produces closed-cell aluminium foam plates which are used as energy and sound absorbing material for automobile industry, building and interior design, aerospace, shipbuilding, railroad transport. On-site laboratory Tensile specimen-round and flat KUMZ has its own laboratory on-site which can perform different testing of aluminium alloy semifinished products in order to evaluate strength, ductility, chemical composition, uniformity of material: * Spectral analysis * Measuring content of the gas in metall * Tensile testing * Bending testing * Hardness testing * Macrostructure, microstructure control * Fracture toughness testing * Electroconductivity measurement * Ultrasonic testing World export Nowadays main part of products produced by KUMZ is meant for export. Aluminium semi-fabricated products are delivered to 46 countries of the World ‚Äì in Europe, North and South Americas, Asia, Africa, Oceania. According to requirements of leading consumers of aluminium semis KUMZ received following certificates:KUMZ Certificates ISO 9001:2000 and AS9100 (by SGS from 2006 till 2009, by T√úV from 2009), ISO 14001, OSHAS18001, Lloyd‚Äôs Register, Interstate Aviation Committee, Det Norske Veritas, Nadcap (NDT, Heat treating), IRIS (International Railway Industry Standard).

Early life Pollard was the son of the historian Albert Pollard and was born in Putney, London on 7 March 1903. After studying at Shrewsbury School, Pollard studied history for one year at University College, London before winning a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford in 1921, obtaining a third-class degree in history in 1924. At Oxford he was part of the Hypocrites' Club. In that year he married Kay Beauchamp, pioneering Communist and women's rights campaigner. (Their marriage was dissolved in 1972). Career Even whilst he was a student, he was well known as a book collector, and bought part of a booksellers' business (Birrell and Garnett) in London. He became managing director in 1927, with the company producing many noted catalogues in the 1920s and 1930s, some of which were to become standard works of reference. Pollard's knowledge of his subject was displayed in his contributions to The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature and in his lectures and articles. With John Carter, he wrote An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets (1934), exposing the prominent book collector Thomas J. Wise as a fraud. In 1937, Harry Carter, Ellic Howe, Alfred F. Johnson, Stanley Morison and Pollard started to produce a list of all known pre-1800 type specimens. This project was completed and published April 1940. Because of World War II, many libraries at the European continent were not accessible at that time.A list of Typespecimens, The Bibliographic Society, London, 1942, printed at the Oxford University Press In 1939, the bookshop partnership ended and Pollard became a special lecturer at University College, London before joining the Board of Trade in 1942; whilst this was supposedly a temporary appointment, he remained until retirement in 1959. He maintained his bibliographical interests, publishing an edition of The Earliest Directory of the Book Trade by John Pendred (1785), and lecturing in Cambridge shortly before his retirement. During his retirement, he was president from 1960 to 1962 of the London Bibliographical Society, which awarded him its Gold Medal in 1969,http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/goldmedl.htm and was Reader in Bibliography at the University of Oxford in 1961, lecturing on the book trade in medieval Oxford. He also lectured in the United States in 1973, and received a volume of essays published in his honour by the Oxford Bibliographical Society in 1975. He died at the Radcliffe Infirmary on 15 November 1976.

She was born in Santo Suarez neighborhood in Havana, and passed her childhood in Guanabacoa, a township within the province of La Habana. She has worked in various movies and with several long established artists, including Celia Cruz, Chavela Vargas, Joaqu√≠n Sabina, Andy Garcia, Manzanita or Llu√≠s Llach.  Artistic career  At the early age of seven, Lucrecia began studying piano and music and was certified with a specialty in piano at the Instituto Superior de Arte de Cuba. She studied singing with Isolina Carrillo, the composer of the famous bolero \\"Dos Gardenias\\", popularized in Spain by Cuban singer Antonio Mach√≠n. Soon after completing her education, Lucrecia joined La Orquesta Anacaona, an all-female group which, since its founding in 1932, had become a Cuban institution. In the 1980s and early 1990s, she made several international tours with the group. It was with Anacaona, as lead vocalist, keyboardist and arranger, that Lucrecia first arrived in Spain. Later, in 1993, she left Anacaona and returned to settle in Barcelona, where she has remained. Since establishing her solo career there, she has become very active in Spanish film and television as well as the music scene. Though not yet well known in the English-speaking world, she is a celebrated figure not only in Spain and, increasingly, in Latin America and the Hispanic community of the United States. Although she personally eschews such comparisons, Lucrecia has been touted as a successor to the great Celia Cruz, with whom she was a close friend. Lucrecia's 2010 √Ålbum de Cuba was nominated for Best Contemporary Tropical Album in the 2010 Latin Grammy Awards. Since leaving Anacaona and becoming an expatriate of Cuba, the Cuban government has not allowed her to return, but she was able to bring her mother to Barcelona, which they both make their permanent home. Through the length of her career, Lucrecia has collaborated or performed with numerous masters of the art, including Celia Cruz, Paquito D‚ÄôRivera, Chano Dom√≠nguez, Joaqu√≠n Sabina, Wyclef Jean, Carlos \\"Patato\\" Valdes, Carel Kraayenhof, Willy Chirino, Chavela Vargas, Llu√≠s Llach, Gilberto Gil, Israel \\"Cachao\\" L√≥pez, Andy Garc√≠a, Carlos Jean, Nuno da C√¢mara Pereira (Portuguese Fado singer, Nuno da C√¢mara Pereira, etc. Among her collaborations should be noted Cachao: The Last Mambo, a winning album at the Latin Grammy awards in 2011 and for the 2012 Grammy Awards. Based on a memorable concert recorded live in Miami in September 2007, the album was as tribute to Israel \\"Cachao\\" Lopez celebrating the 80-year musical career of that great master. As an artist, Lucrecia has combined her musical side with television, having been involved in programs of considerable success in Spain. On Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola, she was host of the successful children's program Los Lunnis. Lucrecia has also demonstrated her facet as a writer. In 2004, she made her debut as a writer of children's stories with ‚ÄúBesitos de chocolate‚Äù (Little Chocolate Kisses) ( \\"Tales of my childhood\\"), after which have followed two more books from the same collection: The Valley of the Tenderness (2005) and All the Colors of the World (2008), all in collaboration with Los Lunnis. Continuing in this vein, she has edited her disk and video La Casita de Lucrecia. In June 2012 she began the tour \\"Eternally Cuba\\". In 2019, Lucrecia starred in , a musical about the life of Celia Cruz, at the Lehman Arts Center.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8527402/celia- cruz-musical-lucrecia-interview-new-york Recordings Lucrecia can be heard in the following YouTube links: * Si me pudieras querer with La Orquesta Anacaona. * El Alardoso with La Orquesta Anacaona. * Guantanamera Lucrecia, Andy Garc√≠a y Arturo Sandoval en L√≥pez Tonight * Amaneci en tus brazos Lucrecia and Joaquin Sabina * Qui es Qui an interview with Justo Molinero * Mi zurr√≥n during a show in Telde Filmography *Segunda piel (1999) by Gerardo Vera, singing her song Youkali. *Ataque verbal (1999) by Miguel Albaladejo, as an actress. *Balseros (2002), by Carles Boch and Josep Maria Dom√®nech, original soundtrack. *El gran gato (2003) by Ventura Pons, singing \\"Barca, cielo y ola\\" as a tribute to Gato P√©rez. *Los Lunnis (2003‚Äì2009), RTVE program, as an actress.

Women should speak to their doctor or healthcare professional before starting or stopping any medications while pregnant. Tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drug use while pregnant may be dangerous for the unborn baby and may lead to severe health problems and/or birth defects. Even small amounts of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana have not been proven to be safe when taken while pregnant. In some cases, for example, if the mother has epilepsy or diabetes, the risk of stopping a medication may be worse than risks associated with taking the medication while pregnant. The mother's healthcare professional will help make these decisions about the safest way to protect the health of both the mother and unborn child. In addition to medications and substances, some dietary supplements are important for a healthy pregnancy, however, others may cause harm to the unborn child. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States reports that there are six million pregnancies with at least 50% of the women taking at least one medication. In addition a reported 5‚Äì10% of women of childbearing age abuse alcohol or drugs. Of those who bear children, recreational drug use can have serious consequences to the health of not only the mother, but also the fetus as many medications can cross the placenta and reach the fetus. Some of the consequences on the babies include physical abnormalities, higher risk of stillbirth, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and others.  Medications  Some medications can cause harm to the unborn baby, but in some instances the benefits may outweigh the risks to the baby or mother. A woman who has diabetes mellitus may need intensive therapy with insulin to prevent complications to the mother and baby.  Medications used to treat diabetes  Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that is first diagnosed during pregnancy and can accordingly cause high blood sugar that affects the woman and the baby. In 10 - 20% of women whose diet and exercise are not adequate enough to control blood sugar, insulin injections may be required to lower blood sugar levels. Medications that can be used in diabetes during pregnancy include insulin, glyburide and metformin.  Pain Medications  The most common over-the-counter pain-relieving medications include aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include naproxen (Aleve), ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin), among others. The safety of these medications vary by class and by strength. Pregnant women who use prescription medications containing opioids while pregnant may cause serious harm to the mother or unborn child. For some people, the risk of stopping a medication such as prescription opioids may be more serious than the risk of taking a medication. = Acetaminophen = Short-term use of acetaminophen as directed is one of the only medications recommended for treating pain and fever in women who are pregnant. There is no established association with teratogenicity or elevated occurrence of birth defects and the usage of acetaminophen at any point during a pregnancy. There is potential for fetal liver toxicity in cases of maternal overdose, where the mother consumes more than the recommended daily dose. = Non-steroidal anti- inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) = Ibuprofen and naproxen have not frequently been studied during pregnancy, but recent studies do not show increased risk of spontaneous abortion within the first six weeks of pregnancy. However, all NSAIDs showed association with structural cardiac defects with usage during the early weeks of pregnancy. When ibuprofen and naproxen are used within the third trimester, there is a significant increase in the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus with primary pulmonary hypertension in the newborn. Between the lack of studies of the effect of ibuprofen and naproxen on pregnancy, it is recommended that pregnant women avoid these medications or use them sparingly per physician recommendations. = Aspirin = Usage of aspirin during pregnancy is not recommended. Aspirin use during pregnancy has not demonstrated an increased risk of spontaneous abortion within the early weeks of pregnancy. However, its usage during organogenesis and the third trimester can lead to elevated risk of intrauterine growth retardation and maternal hemorrhage. = Pain medications containing opioids = For more information, see the below section on Recreational drugs Any medications containing opioids may be dangerous for the unborn baby and should not be taken while pregnant.  Anticonvulsant medications  Most women with epilepsy deliver healthy babies and have a health pregnancy, however, some women with epilepsy are at a higher risk for losing their baby (stillborn) and of the baby having birth defects such as neural tube defects. Women who have epilepsy require advice from their doctor to determine the safest way to protect both the mother and unborn child from health risks associated with seizures and the risk of birth defects associated with some of the commonly prescribed anticonvulsant medications. Valproic acid and its derivatives such as sodium valproate and divalproex sodium may cause congenital malformations (birth defects). An increased dose causes decreased intelligence quotient. Valproic acid use during pregnancy increases the risk of neural tube defects by approximately 20-fold. Evidence is conflicting for carbamazepine regarding any increased risk of congenital physical anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders by intrauterine exposure. Similarly, children exposed to lamotrigine or phenytoin in the womb do not seem to differ in their skills compared to those who were exposed to carbamazepine.  Antacids  Heartburn is a common symptom of late term pregnancy during which up to 80% of pregnant women have experienced it by the end of their third trimester. Heartburn often indicates the development of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), where the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes due to elevated progesterone levels causing increased frequency and severity of gastric reflux or heartburn. If heartburn appears after 20 weeks of gestational age or is severe and persistent, this can indicate other conditions including HELLP syndrome and preeclampsia. Common antacids include aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (Maalox) and calcium carbonate (Tums). Histamine H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors, such as famotidine (Pepcid) and omeprazole (Prilosec), respectively, can also be used to help relieve heartburn, with no known teratogenic effects or congenital malformations. Aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate, when consumed, do not cross the placenta and are regarded as safe pharmacological options to treat heartburn, since there are no significant association with maldevelopment or injury to fetus. Ginger and acupressure are common non- pharmacological options used to treat nausea and vomiting as alternatives to antacids, histamine H2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors. Lifestyle modifications are often recommended as well. Recommended modifications can include avoiding fatty food, reducing size and frequency of meals, and reducing caffeine intake.  Anticoagulants  Anticoagulants are medications that prevent the blood from forming clots and are also known as blood thinners. These medications are commonly used for both prevention and treatment in people who are at risk for or have experienced a heart attack, stroke, or venous thromboembolism. Pregnancy increases the risk of clot formation in women due to elevated levels of certain clotting factors and compounds in the body, and the risk increases even more immediately after birth and remains elevated up to 3 months after delivery. Anticoagulants must be prescribed with caution as these medications can have negative health consequences for the developing baby and need to consider dosing and medication management options. = Warfarin = Warfarin (brand name Coumadin) is a commonly prescribed blood thinner both in the inpatient and outpatient hospital settings. In pregnant women, warfarin is contraindicated and should be avoided as it crosses the placental barrier. Additionally, warfarin is listed as Pregnancy Category D, which means it has a risk of harming the fetus. However, it has been shown that daily warfarin doses up to 5 mg may be beneficial for pregnant women who are at higher risk of thromboembolism. = Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) = A common low molecular weight heparin drug is called enoxaparin (brand name Lovenox). Enoxaparin is listed as Pregnancy Category B, meaning animal studies have failed to show harmful effects to the fetus and therefore are safe to use in pregnant women. However, pregnant women taking LMWH may not experience the full anticoagulant effect due to the nature of the medication compared to other anticoagulants (i.e. warfarin) and may be less favorable for users as it is an injectable medication. = Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) = Unfractionated heparin is another type of anticoagulant that has been widely used. UFH is classified as Pregnancy Category C, which means animal studies have shown potential for adverse effects to the fetus; however, there needs to be more studies done to confirm the presence of a risk to the fetus. UFH can be used in pregnant women as long as the benefits outweigh the risk. = Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) = Direct oral anticoagulants are newer types of anticoagulants that are available as oral medications and are widely used in non-pregnant populations. As many studies looking at DOACs exclude pregnant women, there is not enough evidence to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of DOACs in pregnant women. Currently, rivaroxaban (Xarelto), dabigatran (Pradaxa), and edoxaban (Savaysa) are DOACs listed under Pregnancy Category C, and apixaban (Eliquis) is listed under Pregnancy Category B.  Antidiarrheal  Diarrhea is not a common symptom of pregnancy; however, it can occur as a result of reduced gastric acidity and slowed intestinal motility. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), loperamide (Imodium), and atropine/diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are antidiarrheal agents that can be used to treat diarrhea. However, not all of them are safe to use during pregnancy. One of the components of bismuth subsalicylate is salicylate, which is a component that crosses the placenta. Due to this, there is an increased risk for intrauterine growth retardation, fetal hemorrhage, and maternal hemorrhage within organogenesis and in the second/third trimester. Loperamide has limited data on the impact it has on pregnancy, but there is an association with cardiovascular malformation in the first trimester. Atropine/diphenoxylate currently has insufficient evidence of teratogenicity in humans, but trials with animals showed evidence of teratogenic effects.  Antihistamines  Antihistamines may be prescribed in early pregnancy for the treatment of nausea and vomiting along with symptoms of asthma and allergies. First generation antihistamines include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), chlorpheniramine (Diabetic Tussin), hydroxizine (Atarax), and doxepin (Sinequan). Second generation antihistamines include loratadine (Claritin), cetrizine (Zyrtec), and fexofenadine (Allegra). First generation antihistamines have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier which can result in sedative and anticholinergic effects while effectively treating allergic reactions and nausea and vomiting related to pregnancy. On the other hand, second generation antihistamines do not cross the blood-brain barrier, thus eliminating sedating effects. Currently, there is a lack of association between prenatal antihistamine exposure and birth defects. Antihistamines during pregnancy have not been linked to birth defects; however, further research is necessary for some antihistamine medications to determine safety during pregnancy. It is suggested that women speak to their healthcare professionals before taking any over-the-counter or prescription medication while pregnant to ensure that there are no adverse health outcomes.  Anti-hypertensives  Hypertensive issues are the most common cardiovascular disorders during pregnancy, occurring within 5 to 10% of all pregnant females. Anti-hypertensives are blood pressure medications used to treat high blood pressure in pregnant women. This class of medication is commonly used to treat problems such as heart failure, heart attack, and kidney failure. Caution must be exercised with the use of various hypertensive agents for the treatment of blood pressure. While the drug classes of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), and angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) have been shown to be potent anti-hypertensive agents, their use is advised against during pregnancy. ACEi and ARB have known fetotoxicities when used during the second or third trimester or both. Signs and symptoms of ACEi and ARB use during pregnancy include kidney damage or failure, oligohydramnios, anuria, joint contractures, and hypoplasia of the skull. Common, alternative agents for high blood pressure in pregnant women include anti-adrenergic and beta-blocking medications, such as methyldopa or metoprolol, respectively.  Decongestants  Decongestants are often used in conjunction with cold medications or to combat pregnancy rhinitis in pregnant women. Common decongestants include pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine. Pseudoephedrine is an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist that enacts a vasoconstrictive effect to reduce airflow resistance in the nasal cavity and allow easier breathing by relieving a stuffy or congested nose. When taken in early trimesters, there has been limited evidence to associate pseudoephedrine with birth defects. However, studies often found it difficult to isolate pseudoephedrine's involvement, due to the variety of combination products that contain pseudoephedrine in conjunction with other medications. Since pseudoephedrine activates alpha adrenergic receptors, it has the ability to elevate blood pressure and cause vasoconstriction within the uterine arteries. This can negatively affect blood flow to the fetus. Due to the lack of studies, decongestants in combination drugs or isolated forms are suggested to be used sparingly during pregnancy. Saline nasal sprays, among other non- pharmacological treatments, are considered to be safe alternatives for decongestants.  Dietary Supplements  Dietary supplements such as folic acid and iron are important for a healthy pregnancy. Some dietary supplements can cause side effects and harm to the mother or unborn child. Pregnant women should discuss all dietary supplements with their health care professional to determine the appropriate dosage and which supplements are safe during pregnancy. Caution should be taken before consuming dietary supplements while pregnant as dietary supplements are considered \\"foods\\" rather than medications and are not regulated for safety and efficacy by the FDA.  Illicit and recreational drugs   Alcohol  Alcohol should not be consumed while pregnant. Even a small amount of alcohol is not known to be safe for the unborn baby. Alcohol passes easily from the mother's bloodstream through the placenta and into the bloodstream of the fetus. Since the fetus is smaller and does not have a fully developed liver, the concentration of alcohol in its bloodstream lasts longer, increasing the chances of detrimental side effects. The severity of effects alcohol may have on a developing fetus depends upon the amount and frequency of alcohol consumed as well as the stage of pregnancy. Rates of alcohol consumption can generally be categorized in one of three ways: heavy drinking (more than 48-60 grams of ethanol/day), moderately high drinking (24-48 grams of ethanol/day), and binge drinking (4-5 drinks/90 grams of ethanol at a time). Heavy drinking and binge drinking are closely associated with a higher risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe form of FASD is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). This used to be the only diagnosis for fetal disorders due to alcohol consumption, but the term was broadened to a \\"spectrum\\" due to the variety of abnormalities observed in newborns. This was most likely because of the different amounts of alcohol ingested during pregnancy indicating that there is not a clear, specific dose that determines if a fetus will be affected by alcohol or not. FAS is characterized by slower physical growth, distinct facial abnormalities including smooth philtrum, thin vermilion, and short palpebral fissures, neurological deficits, or smaller head circumference. Other problems associated with FASD include delayed or uncoordinated motor skills, hearing or vision problems, learning disabilities, behavior problems, and inappropriate social skills compared to same-age peers. Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and develop substance use disorders themselves.  Caffeine  Caffeine is a widespread drug consumed by adults due to its behavioral and stimulating effects. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an acceptable intake of caffeine for pregnant women is less than or equal to 200 mg per day. Consumption of caffeine is not associated with adverse reproductive and developmental effects. The half-life of caffeine is longer in pregnancy by 8 to 16 more hours, which means that caffeine stays in the person longer, increases fetal exposure to caffeine, and is eliminated slower in the body. Other comprehensive reviews reported that caffeine intake of more than 300 mg per day have been associated with spontaneous abortions and low birth weight, but further research is needed to establish this causal relationship.  Cannabis  Cannabis use during pregnancy should be avoided. There is no known safe dose of cannabis while pregnant and use of cannabis may lead to birth defects, pre-term birth, or low birth weight. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), an active ingredient in cannabis, can both cross the placenta and accumulates in high concentrations in breast milk. Cannabis consumption in pregnancy might be associated with restrictions in growth of the fetus, miscarriage, and cognitive deficits. Infants exposed to prenatal cannabis may show signs of increased tremors and altered sleep patterns. Cannabis is the most frequently used, illicit drug amongst pregnant women. There are significant limitations to the current research available. One limitation is because most studies done are dated in the 1980s. Additionally, many studies done on cannabis that evaluate its safety often fail to account for confounding factors, a variable that could also be having an effect on an outcome that is not the test variable. For example, tobacco use and sociodemographic differences are often not adjusted for accordingly in many studies.  Cocaine  Use of cocaine in pregnant women is dangerous and can lead to cardiovascular complications like hypertension, myocardial infarction and ischemia, kidney failure, liver rupture, cerebral ischemia, cerebral infarction, and maternal death. Cardiac muscles become more sensitive to cocaine in pregnancy, in the presence of increasing progesterone concentrations. Cocaine use leads to increased risk for perinatal outcomes: preterm delivery, low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) or reduced birth rate, small size and earlier gestational age at delivery. Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with premature birth, birth defects, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other conditions.  Methamphetamine  Use of methamphetamine is dangerous for pregnant women and to the unborn baby. Methamphetamines are a class of drugs that provide stimulant-like effects, including euphoria and alertness. The drug crosses the placenta and affects the fetus during the gestational stage of pregnancy. Methamphetamine use in pregnancy may lead to babies born with an earlier gestational age at delivery (pre-term), lower birth weight, and smaller head circumference. Methamphetamine use during pregnancy also negatively impacts brain development and behavioral functioning and increases the risk of the baby having ADHD and lower mental processing speed.  Opioids  Opioids such as heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone and methadone should not be taken while pregnant. Opioid use during pregnancy may cause adverse outcomes for the women and unborn child. Women who abuse opioids during pregnancy are at a higher risk for premature birth, lower birth weight, still birth, specific birth defects, and withdrawal (neonatal abstinence syndrome). Opioids can cross the placenta and the blood brain barrier to the fetus. Opioid abuse is the main cause of neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is where the baby experiences withdrawals from the drug they were exposed to during the pregnancy. Typical symptoms may include tremors, convulsions, twitching, excessive crying, poor feeding or sucking, slow weight gain, breathing problems, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p0fwjFSlsgWkT643vw04_HNl4NKe9rBIu9vbbOD5uf8/edit# There is no consensus on the effects on cognitive abilities. Further research is required to determine the long-term effects of in utero exposure to opioid medications on children.  Tobacco  Smoking during pregnancy is dangerous to the unborn baby and may cause pre-term birth, birth defects such as cleft lip or cleft palate, or miscarriage. Tobacco is the most commonly used substance among pregnant women, at 25%. Nicotine crosses the placenta and accumulates within fetal tissues. Children born to women who smoked heavily were more susceptible to behavioral problems such as ADHD, poor impulse control, and aggressive behaviors. Tobacco contains carbon monoxide, which has the potential to prevent the fetus from receiving sufficient oxygen. Other health concerns tobacco poses are premature birth, low birth weight, and an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) of up to three times compared to infants not exposed to tobacco. Smoking and pregnancy, combined, cause twice the risk of premature rupture of membranes, placental abruption and placenta previa. In addition to the fetus, women in general who smoke heavily are less likely to become pregnant.  Pregnancy categories  Until 2014, the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations required that certain drugs and biological products be labelled specifically with respect to their effects on pregnant populations, including a definition of a \\"pregnancy category\\". These rules were enforced by the FDA, and medications that have been studied for their effects in pregnancy fell under the following Pregnancy Categories: A, B, C, D, or X depending on how they have been studied and what kind of results were found from the studies. In 2014, however, the FDA has developed a \\"Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR)\\" which requires product labels to include specific information related to the safety and effectiveness of medications to pregnant and lactating women. This ruling has removed the requirement of stating pregnancy categories in prescription drug labels. Australia's categorization system takes into account birth defects, the effects around birth or when the mother gives birth, and problems that will arise later in the child's life due to the drug taken. The system places them into a category based on the severity of the consequences that the drug can have on the infant when it crosses the placenta.

Mixtures of the three gasses are usually depicted in a triangular diagram, known as a ternary plot. Such diagrams are available in the speciality literature.for instance in Michael George Zabetakis' 1965 work, which remains one of the most widely cited sources of flammability data.Mashuga 1998Crowl 2003 The same information can be depicted in a normal orthogonal diagram, showing only two substances, implicitly using the feature that the sum of all three components is 100 percent. The diagrams below only concerns one fuel; the diagrams can be generalized to mixtures of fuels. Understanding flammability diagrams Triangular diagrams are not commonplace. The easiest way to understand them is to briefly go through three basic steps in their construction. #Consider the first triangular diagram below, which shows all possible mixtures of methane, oxygen and nitrogen. Air is a mixture of about 21 volume percent oxygen, and 79 volume percent inerts (nitrogen). Any mixture of methane and air will therefore lie on the straight line between pure methane and pure air - this is shown as the blue air-line. The upper and lower flammability limits of methane in air are located on this line, as shown. #The stoichiometric combustion of methane is: CH4 \\\\+ 2O2 ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ 2H2O. The stoichiometric concentration of methane in oxygen is therefore 1/(1+2), which is 33 percent. Any stoichiometric mixture of methane and oxygen will lie on the straight line between pure nitrogen (and zero percent methane) and 33 percent methane (and 67 percent oxygen) - this is shown as the red stoichiometric line. The upper and lower flammability limits of methane in oxygen are located on the methane axis, as shown. #The actual envelope defining the flammability zone can only be determined based on experiments. The envelope will pass through the upper and lower flammability limits of methane in oxygen and in air, as shown. The nose of the envelope defines the limiting oxygen concentration (LOC)).

Within 10 months, 4,000 of 9,000 refugees were sent to Western countries. In the same period, an additional 11,000 refugees arrived in Malaysia. The implementation of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals to qualify for refugee status prompted some of them to opt for the voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia to reduce the size of its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme,More Vietnamese illegals keen to return home, p. 8, 15 February 1994, New Straits Times, retrieved 25 September 2013136 Vietnamese boat people volunteer to return home, p. 5, 30 July 1992, New Straits Times, retrieved 25 September 2013 and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994.Refugee camp at Sungai Besi to close next year, p. 9, 25 October 1994, New Straits Times, retrieved 19 September 2013 Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants.

From that point, Malaya provided aid to the South Vietnamese regime in its fight against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army. Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman made a first visit on 1958 which was reciprocated twice by the South Vietnamese President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám on 28‚Äì31 January 1958 and in October 1961. By 1963, when Malaya transformed into Malaysia (with an additional territory in the island of Borneo), the main government in Kuala Lumpur worried the influence of North Vietnamese communists would threaten its existence in accordance to the Domino theory, thus changing its position to become very supportive of the American involvement in the Vietnam War as Malaysia had also experienced a communist insurgency of its own. Tunku Abdul Rahman then expressed these concerns in December 1966 and called on the United States and the United Kingdom to provide increased logistical support to war efforts in Vietnam.Carl T.

Social developments  A sizeable number of Malaysian men have foreign wives, especially Vietnamese women. Accounts of such marriages first surfaced in the 1990s, but in the 2000s these marriages became especially popular with older Chinese Malaysian men. A thriving matchmaking industry in which prospective grooms could select Vietnamese brides based on road shows and profiling methods has developed.

HTR aims at comprehensive involvement of all stakeholders to investigate the feasibility, viability and usefulness of remembering the Troubles and in so doing both individually and collectively contribute to building a better future for all. Through ongoing internal discussions, research, round table discussions, conferences and outreach programmes, HTR has produced a range of reports, options papers, discussion papers and audits which continue to inform discussion throughout society ‚Äì this includes community groups, political parties, statutory and Government policy makers. The object of Healing Through Remembering is to promote, for the benefit of the public in Northern Ireland, the advancement of education in the purpose and methods of mediation, conciliation and reconciliation of disputes or conflicts and of all the means of managing them for peaceful resolution in the interests of good citizenship and community relations and in particular to promote research and the exchange of views that help towards education into the causes, prevention and alleviation of destructive patterns of behaviour and into peaceful means of resolving conflict. Members come from across Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland and have been meeting over the past number of years to focus on the issue of how to deal with the past relating to the conflict in and about Northern Ireland. History In March 2000 the All Truth is Bitter Reporthttp://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/victims/docs/alltruthisbitter99.pdf was launched. It documented the visit of Dr. Alex Boraine to Northern Ireland in February 1999 and recommended wide-ranging discussion to explore and debate ways of examining the past and processes of remembering so as to build a better future. A number of individuals were invited by the authors of All Truth is Bitter to form a Board. After much discussion, in June 2001 a diverse group of individuals agreed to become the Healing Through Remembering Project Board and carry forward the work of the project. Public consultation HTR carried out an extensive consultation in 2002 which asked individuals, organisations and communities \\"How should people remember the events connected with the conflict in and about Northern Ireland and in so doing, individually and collectively contribute to the healing of the wounds of society? Healing Through Remembering Report 2002 In June 2002 HTR published the findings of the consultation in the form of the Healing Through Remembering Report. This report made six recommendations: * a collective storytelling and archiving process, * a day of reflection, * a network of commemoration and remembering projects, * a living memorial museum, * acknowledgement leading to the possibility of truth recovery and * a Healing Through Remembering Initiative. Healing Through Remembering Initiative The organisation has established five Sub Groups to engage in dialogue and discussion and carry out research to fully examine the recommendations of the 2002 Report. Storytelling Sub Group The Storytelling group considers how a collective oral narrative might work as vehicle for dealing with the past. The group is developing the parameters for research into the impact of Storytelling. The Storytelling Sub Group has carried out and published an audit of storytelling initiatives related to the conflict, hosted a one-day conference on the theme of \\"Storytelling as the Vehicle?\\" and published a report of the conference. The Sub Group is currently working on producing a Good Practice Guide to Storytelling incorporating the values, definitions and core principles of storytelling. Day of Reflection Sub Group The Day of Reflection group considers how best the conflict can be collectively remembered and reflected upon. The first Day of Private Reflection took place on Thursday 21 June 2007. The purpose of the day is to \\"Provide an opportunity for people to remember the events of the past in a non-confrontational, dignified and respectful manner.\\" Healing Through Remembering and its Day of Reflection Sub Group took time to carefully consider and plan the day to bring it to fruition. A free- phone telephone support line was made available before, during and after the day. The Day of Private Reflection was launched in March 2007 and received considerable media interest and attention. Interest and support for the Day of Private Reflection came from all sections of the community. There was widespread support in favour of a second Day of Private Reflection, with Healing Through Remembering as the lead organisation. A full and independent evaluation of the day was commissioned and is scheduled for publication in March 2008. The sub-group also held a residential which took place in September 2007. A full range of materials to help raise awareness of the Day of Private Reflection and aid reflection on the Day have been produced and are available to order free of charge from HTR or via www.dayofreflection.com Groups and individuals are also encouraged to develop their own materials and resources. The Day of Reflection Sub Group carried out extensive research on international experiences of days of remembrance before proceeding with plans for an initial Day of Private Reflection on 21 June 2007. Living Memorial Museum Sub Group The Living Memorial Museum group considers what form a living memorial and museum might take. The form of the Living Memorial Museum is still under discussion. The Living Memorial Museum Sub Group has commissioned an extensive audit of artefacts relating to the conflict which are held in existing archives and personal collections. Dr. Kris Brown is conducting the audit which is being carried out through a joint Fellowship post at QUB. The group has also conducted an Open Call for Ideas on what form a Living Memorial Museum to the conflict could take. A wide range of submissions were received and plans are underway for displaying them and generating further ideas. Commemoration Sub Group The Commemoration Sub Group is currently examining the issues relating to commemoration and commissioned research on the subject to inform their thinking on possible ways forward. The research considered: what is commemoration and what is its role in societies emerging from conflict? A roundtable event on similar issues was held in January 2007. The Sub Group is currently finalising its strategic plan and considering future directions for the group. Truth Recovery & Acknowledgement Sub Group The Network of Commemoration group examines the role of commemoration post conflict. The Sub Group is continuing to host partnership events with interested organisations and groups on both the report and the issue of truth recovery. The Truth Recovery and Acknowledgement Sub Group has undertaken two large pieces of work to date. The first, a scoping study on the current positions of key organisations, institutions and parties relating to acknowledgement of their role in the conflict was used to inform a discussion paper and proposal on what form acknowledgement might take. The paper, Acknowledgement and its Role in Preventing Future Violence, was published in October 2006. The second piece of research developed by the group was a document on possible options for truth recovery. The document, Making Peace with the Past: Options for truth recovery regarding the conflict in and about Northern Ireland, was launched on 31 October 2006. Since the publication of the report the Sub Group has hosted a series of open meetings on the issue of truth recovery across Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. These open meetings concluded at the end of April. Consultants Database Details of any research being commissioned by Healing Through Remembering on behalf of the Sub Groups is circulated to all researchers and facilitators who are listed on the Healing Through Remembering Consultants Database. Membership Members of Healing Through Remembering are kept informed of the work of the organisation, are invited to participate in seminars, talks and other events and have voting rights at the AGM.

It is one of South Asia's largest nationals parks, and is a UNESCO declared Biosphere Reserve. Lal Sohanra is notable for the diversity of its landscape, which includes desert, forest and wetland ecosystems. Geography and wildlife The park itself is situated some 35 kilometres east of Bahawalpur and presents a synthesis of forest and desert life. It occupies land on both sides of Desert Branch canal, and is spread over an area of 127,480 acres (51,368 hectares) - out of which 20,974 acres (8,491 hectares) are green land (irrigated plantations), 101,726 acres (40,942 hectares) are dry land (desert), and 4,780 acres are wet land (ponds and lakes). The park's terrain is generally flat, interspersed with sand dunes measuring between 1 and 6 meters in height and occupying as many as thousands of acres apiece. The biosphere reserve is crossed by the dried-up bed of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and comprises Patisar Lake and irrigated land. Officials said that indigenous trees like Indian rosewood and Acacia karroo will be planted over 1,212 acres of barren land in the wildlife reserve. Many species of animals can be found throughout the park. These include several wild animals of the desert such as Asiatic wildcats, rabbits, bustards, and deer. Reptiles in the park include the monitor lizard, Russell's viper, Indian cobra, saw-scaled viper, wolf snake, John's sand boa, and spiny-tailed lizard. More than 160 species of birds are also present, including the houbara bustard, griffon vulture, crested honey buzzard, marsh harrier, hen harrier, laggar falcon, peregrine falcon, kestrel, Eurasian sparrowhawk, Egyptian vulture, lark, shrike, wheatear, and barn owl. Lake Patisar, a large body of water in the center of the park, is ideal for bird watching. In mid-winter, the lake is regularly home to between 10,000 and 30,000 ducks and common coot. Attractions The Punjab government has plans to convert the Lal Sohanra National Park into a wildlife safari park of international standard. One of its most prominent attractions is currently the lion safari, which allows guests to see lions in their natural habitat at close range. In addition, the park's captive breeding suite holds a pair of Indian rhinoceros which were given by Nepal. Rhinos were once found as far west as the Peshawar Valley during the reign of Mughal Emperor Babur, but are now extinct in Pakistan. Over 400 animals are currently being bred in the Lal Sohanra Park, including a large population of blackbucks, a breed of antelope most notable for its pronounced sexual dimorphism. The park is constantly supplied with new blackbucks in order to extend its efforts toward blackbuck conservation. There are archaeological remains of an ancient civilization which once flourished along the Ghaggar-Hakra River.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has raised the expatriate population, which has grown from 20,000 in 2013 to 60,000 in 2018. Distribution Karachi During the 1940s many Chinese Muslims fled unrest in China and settled in Karachi. However the Chinese community there is primarily of non-Muslim origins; their ancestors were Buddhists, but subsequent generations follow other religions or none at all. About 30% are estimated to have converted to Islam. Most Chinese in Karachi are second generation children of immigrants--the oldest generation have mostly died off, while the third generation have emigrated to other countries. Common destinations for emigrants are the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, or to their ancestral country China. They rarely wear Chinese clothing, but still retain the Chinese language, though in recent years they have shown increasing language shift towards Urdu. Previously, the community was segregated by provincial origin, but with the establishment of a Chinese Committee to represent the community, they have become more integrated. They are concentrated in a few neighbourhoods, including near the PECHS and Tariq Road, as well as Saddar and more recently Clifton and Defence neighbourhoods in Saddar Town. The Clifton and Defense Society areas has about 15 Chinese restaurants; the area is sometimes unofficially referred to as \\"Chinatown\\". One of the more well-known of these, the ABC Chinese Restaurant, founded by Li Dianxian (ÊùéÊÆøË¥§) in the 1930s, was once patronised by Zhou Enlai, and continued operating until 1988. Common professions include beauticians, shoemakers, dentists, and the restaurant trade; most members of the second generation tend to follow the same trade as their parents did. Chinese dentists, in particular, have a reputation for providing quality service to the low-income residents of the city. Yet many of them are unlicensed and lack any formal training in dentistry. Instead, many of their parents had previously lived among the Chinese community in British Malaya (present-day Malaysia) and worked as dental assistants; when they came to Pakistan in the 1940s, they began practicing as full dentists themselves. There was a shortage of dentists in Karachi at that time, as there was only one dental school in the entire province of Sindh, at Hyderabad. They primarily provided simple procedures such as manufacture and fitting of dentures as well as extraction of teeth; however, in later years, some prospered enough that they were able to hire formally trained dentists to provide more complex procedures. Other areas In Lahore, Chinese Muslims established a mosque called the Chini Masjid (Chinese Mosque). They typically intermarried with local people and assimilated. The two Chinese shoemakers there, Hopson and Kingson, had a reputation for high quality. Many Chinese people can be seen in Lahore visiting the Anarkali food-street. In Islamabad, the Phoenix restaurant has become well-known. Their clientele includes Pervez Musharraf and ex-president Shaukat Aziz; Musharraf is said to enjoy their Peking duck, stir-fried beef, and garlic lamb chops. There are currently over 25,000 Chinese citizens residing in Islamabad. There is a Chinese cemetery in Gilgit which contains the graves of Chinese workers who died during the construction of the Karakoram Highway in Pakistan during the 1960s and 1970s. Migrant workers Despite the emigration of members of older communities, the Chinese population in Pakistan has been bolstered by new expatriate residents. However, the growth in their population was somewhat interrupted by the September 11, 2001, attacks; fearful that war could break out in Pakistan, most Chinese residents sent their wives and children back home. , there were roughly 3,500 Chinese engineers temporarily residing in Pakistan for work on various state-run projects in various locations, especially in the construction of the Gwadar Port. Their total number might have been as high as 5,000. About 1,200 were estimated to reside in Islamabad. Then, between 2008 and 2009, the number of Chinese working in Pakistan grew sharply, to an estimated 10,000, even as expatriate workers of other nationalities left the country. Ethnic minorities Some members of ethnic minorities of China, primarily Muslim Uyghurs and Tajiks from Xinjiang, have also settled in the northern parts of Pakistan. The earliest migrants, numbering in the thousands, came in the 1940s in fear of communist persecution. A few hundred more fled to Pakistan in the aftermath of a failed uprising in Khotan in 1954. Later waves of migration came in 1963 and again in 1974. Beginning in the 1980s, more Uyghurs who had left China to go on the hajj began settling in Pakistan instead of returning to China. Organisations There are Chinese community organisations in a number of Pakistani cities: * Gilgit: Chinese Association of Gilgit (ÂêâÂ∞îÂêâÁâπÂçé‰∫∫Âçé‰æ®Âçè‰ºö) * Islamabad: Chinese Association of Islamabad (‰ºäÊñØÂÖ∞Â†°Âçé‰∫∫Âçé‰æ®Âçè‰ºö) * Lahore: Chinese Association of Lahore (ÊãâÂêàÂ∞îÂçé‰∫∫Âçé‰æ®Âçè‰ºö) * Rawalpindi: Chinese Association of Rawalpindi (ÊãâÁì¶Â∞îÂìÅÁ¨¨Âçé‰∫∫Âçé‰æ®Âçè‰ºö) * Karachi: Chinese Association of Karachi (Âç°ÊãâÂ•áÂçé‰∫∫Âçé‰æ®Âçè‰ºö) Because of the various threats to Chinese workers in Pakistan, the Chinese embassy have also formed a liaison committee with the Pakistani government to look into safety issues.

The story features Hamachi, a boy fascinated by the Japanese monsters called yokai. When one of these monsters steals his grandmother's soul, he travels into their world to retrieve it. The first volume was published on November 18, 2008, and as of November 24, 2009, two volumes were released. Plot Although y≈çkai (a class of Japanese monsters) are feared and hunted, Hamachi believes that humans can peacefully coexist with the spirits. When Hamachi releases a kappa from one of his grandmother's traps, having to remove its leg to do so, it later returns for revenge against his grandmother and steals her soul. Hamachi then travels into the yokai's world to retrieve her soul. However, he could end up trapped in the realm as well. Production Nina Matsumoto had already received attention for her DeviantArt gallery. After a deal with Bongo Comics and an interview with The Toronto Star, she caught the attention of Dallas Middaugh an associate publisher at Del Rey Manga. After reading her web comic Saturnalia, he asked her for a proposal and she created the initial Y≈çkaiden concept. Middaugh comments that the concept \\"was pretty much ready to go\\" without much change. Middaugh mentions that the protagonist Hamachi reminds him of Son Goku as he was portrayed in the original Dragon Ball series. Reception Y≈çkaiden has been well received by critics. About.com's Deb Aoki considered it to be the best original English language manga of 2008. She commended the series for having \\"well-developed characters that have interesting personalities and fun chemistry with each other.\\" Coolstreak Cartoons' Leroy Douresseaux commends the artist for her artwork saying that it \\"has a lively, fluid feel similar to animation, while her character and creature design is quirky.\\" Carlo Santos of Anime News Network feels the series has \\"a bold sense of line, striking visual designs and clearly defined layouts\\" and says that Matsumoto's strength is in her dialogue. However, Santos believes that the series \\"falls short of a truly haunting atmosphere\\" due to the humor, which sometimes breaks the fourth wall. Erin Finnegan of PopCultureShock says that she \\"can't stop talking about how hilarious\\" Y≈çkaiden is; she also believes it is the best OEL/World manga of 2008. Brigid Alverson from GraphicNovelReporter.com comments that Matsumoto draws the characters with an exaggerated style, bringing out the characters' personalities and depicting the odd creatures with imagination and flair.

A member of the genus Myrmecia in the subfamily Myrmeciinae, it was first described by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. These ants are large, varying from in length. However, colonies contain workers that are much smaller, usually half the size of normal workers. The queens are the largest while the males are the smallest, which can be easily identified due to their small mandibles. Mainly nocturnal M. nigriceps is found in hot hilly areas and woodland, nesting underground in mounds. The ant's diet consists of sweet liquids from flowering plants and invertebrate prey, which are fed to the carnivorous larvae. Spiders are known to eat these ants, and echidnas consume the larvae and pupae. Like other Myrmecia species, M. nigriceps ants possess a powerful and painful sting, and the venom is capable of inducing allergic reactions in sensitive people. Taxonomy First identified by Gustav Mayr in 1862, Mayr provided the first description of M. nigriceps in his journal Myrmecologische Studien. The species was described under the binomial name Myrmecia nigriceps, based on syntype workers collected from Gayndah and Sydney. In 1907, Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel treated M. nigriceps as a variant of M. vindex, but he eventually treated it as a synonym in 1910. M. nigriceps was revived as a full species in 1933 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler, on the basis that it is distributed throughout Australia and its average size is greater than M. vindex. Scottish born Australian entomologist John S. Clark published one synonym ‚Äì Myrmecia fasciata, now considered a junior synonym. M. nigriceps is a member of the genus Myrmecia, a part of the primitive subfamily Myrmeciinae; most ancestors of the genus are only found in fossils, with the exception of the dinosaur ant (Nothomyrmecia macrops). M. nigriceps is a member of the M. gulosa species group, which is the largest species group of the nine groups described. The specific name, nigriceps, is a combination of the Latin words niger, meaning \\"black\\", and caput, meaning \\"head\\". This references the distinctive black head of the ant. With this said, M. nigriceps is commonly known as the black-headed bull ant. Description The size of worker ants varies from . However, colonies contain very small workers, usually less than half the size of normal sized workers. Despite this, it is not known if M. nigriceps is polymorphic, due to little differences in morphology between the workers in comparison to Formicinae ants and Pheidole, with soldiers having enormous heads. The queens are the largest, measuring around , and males being around similar sizes to worker ants at . The head and gaster are black, and the thorax, node, and postpetiole are either red or yellowish red, while the antennae and legs are either yellow or testaceous. The mandibles and clypeus are also yellow. The hair is short and yellow in colour, erect on the body and suberect on the legs. The pubescence (short, fine, soft hair) is white and abundant all over the postpetiole and gaster. The head is almost as broad as its total length, and the mandibles are longer than the head with 13 teeth present. The queen is similar in appearance to the worker, but they are the largest members of the colony. The hair is more abundant, and the head is broader. The mandibles are shorter and broader, although they are still as long as the head. The wings are yellowish in colour and translucent in appearance. Males are the smallest members of the colony and can be easily identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. The hairs on males are the longest and most abundant among the worker and queen castes, with a long and broad head. M. nigriceps is similar in appearance to M. vindex, but several morphological characters distinguish these two species from each other. For example, M. nigriceps is generally larger than M. vindex, and its head is either black or dark brown; the head is broader and more rectangular in workers. The thorax and pedicel are noticeably darker and brownish red. The nests and behaviour, however, of both ants are similar to each other. Distribution and habitat M. nigriceps is distributed throughout Australia, but the ant is absent from areas in central Australia and the northern Australian coast. The range of M. nigriceps extends from Queensland and down into New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. It is also found in South Australia and Western Australia. Colonies are found in deserts, coastal areas, plateaus, woodland, native vegetation, hot hilly areas covered with scrubby vegetation and in rehabilitated sites, at elevations ranging from 300 to 460 metres (1,000 to 1,500 ft). M. nigriceps is a mound constructing species, although colonies can be found under logs. Workers decorate the nest with a variety of items, including lateritic pebbles and soil crumbs, in a similar fashion of meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) nests. Other items used for nest decorating include small stones and plant material. Behaviour and ecology Worker grooming herself M. nigriceps ants are crepuscular and nocturnal foragers, searching for food during the night. Workers are found foraging on Eucalyptus trees and is sympatric with many species. Adults are nectarivores, feeding on sweet liquids from plants and the larvae are carnivorous, feeding on captured invertebrates and other ants such as Camponotus workers and males. Cockroaches, such as Platyzosteria castanea and Platyzosteria ruficeps, can repel attacks by M. nigriceps by discharging a secretion that disorientates the attacking workers. Workers begin to forage one hour before sunset, with peak activity occurring during the twilight hours. These ants have excellent vision, having the largest eye lenses and photoreceptors than any other Myrmecia ant. These ants are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away, sensitive to motion and will rapidly charge towards any moving objects to attack it. These ants are preyed on by the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), and by spiders in the genus Zenodorus, particularly Zenodorus metallescens. Blindsnakes are known to consume the larvae and pupae of these ants. Colonies are also a host for M. inquilina, a social parasite that lays its eggs inside the colony. M. nigriceps is an extremely aggressive ant, and larger colonies may rival other colonies of a different Myrmecia species (such as M. gulosa) in terms of fierceness and pugnacity. While the mandibles cause little to no pain in humans, the ant is equipped with a painful and powerful sting that is found at the end of the gaster. Like other ants, the sting is not barbed, and workers are able to sting multiple times without injuring themselves. With a median lethal dose (LD50) of 7.3 mg/kg, the venom is relatively weak in comparison to other Myrmecia ants, whose LD50 is much lower. However, in a 2011 study, at least one patient had an allergic reaction to M. nigriceps venom. This study also concluded that many other Myrmecia species can cause anaphylaxis, as well as the Green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica). In the Starr sting pain scale, a scale which compares the overall pain of hymenopteran stings on a four-point scale, the sting of M. nigriceps was ranked as two in pain, described as \\"painful\\". M. nigriceps ants are able to enter colonies they do not reside in without being attacked; this may be due to these ants failing to recognise foreigners, or the consequences of ignoring workers from other colonies is low. Nuptial flight occurs after rain for several days, taking place between summer and mid-autumn (December to March). The males and virgin queens emerge from their nest, and unlike other species who mate on the ground or climb onto nearby trees or branches to fly off from, the reproductive alates will fly from the nest. Recorded nuptial flights usually took place on hilltops. M. nigriceps queens are not known to seal up their entrance during colony foundation, unlike other Myrmecia species such as M. regularis. Workers can live exceptionally long, with an average lifespan of 2.2 years; maximum longevity in workers varied from 2.1 to 2.4 years.

The Academy is often referred to as Annapolis. Sports media refer to the Academy as \\"Navy\\" and the students as \\"Midshipmen\\"; this usage is officially endorsed. During the latter half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, the United States Naval Academy was the primary source of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers, with the Class of 1881 being the first to provide officers to the Marine Corps. Graduates of the Academy are also given the option of entering the United States Army or United States Air Force; known as cross-commissioning. Most Midshipmen are admitted through the congressional appointment system. The curriculum emphasizes various fields of engineering. Annapolis graduates who enter aviation and space-related fields have the opportunity to be selected for astronaut training by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This list is drawn from graduates of the Naval Academy who became astronauts. The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The first alumnus to fly as an astronaut was Alan Shepard, class of 1945. As of June 2017, the most recent alumni to complete astronaut training was Nicole Mann, class of 1999. Kayla Barron, class of 2010 was selected as an astronaut candidate in June 2017, but has not yet completed her training. Two alumni were part of Project Mercury, three part of Project Gemini, seven part of the Apollo program, three have walked on the moon, one was part of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and forty-two were part of the Space Shuttle program.

The Loading Zone was based at the Berkeley venue The New Orleans House, but performed numerous times at major venues including the Fillmore West. Although The Loading Zone occasionally headlined, the group is better known for supporting some of the biggest acts of the period including Cream, The Who, The Byrds, Big Brother & the Holding Company, Grateful Dead, Howlin' Wolf, Sam & Dave, Chuck Berry and Buddy Miles.oldhandbills.com - Bill Graham postcards In 1967 the band placed an advertisement in the San Francisco Chronicle seeking a new lead vocalist, which led to the recruitment of Linda Tillery, who joined just prior to the band's signing with RCA Records. Despite their live popularity, the group lacked a strong base of original material; their self-titled debut album was poorly received, and was criticised for its excessive production and its reliance on cover versions. The Loading Zone was unable to garner support from radio, and eventually split in 1969.During this period, drummer John Chambers, previously the touring drummer with We Five and later a member of the Elvin Bishop Band, also played with the group. See profile of John Chambers, Millard Agency, Elvin Bishop Band. News release, 1969; Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco. Retrieved 2017-01-15. In 1969, Fauerso re-formed the group with new members- guitarist Steve Busfield, bassist Mike Eggleston, and drummer George Marsh, and initially with previous horn players Todd Anderson (tenor sax) and Patrick O'Hara (trombone). Anderson was replaced after a few months by Ron Taormina. The new Zone also recruited old friend and drummer Frank Davis to play with the group for a while. During this brief period, the band performed with two drummers at the same time - Davis and Marsh - with some exciting results. The band recorded their second LP One for All for their own label, Umbrella, before disbanding in 1971. Tillery released her solo debut album Sweet Linda Divine on CBS Records in 1970. It was produced by Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat and Tears fame. Fauerso went on to produce the unreleased Mike Love solo album First Love and more recently, a second entitled Only One Earth. Fauerso went on to make recordings of new-age music and also to compose and produce award-winning commercials for radio and TV. Tillery resurfaced with the jazz fusion group Cesar 830 before embarking on a solo career. In 2005, Fauerso reconnected with Eggleston and Marsh to record a new Loading Zone CD entitled Blue Flame.

Located on the western side of Forrest Place in the city's central business district, its imposing stone facade is in the Beaux-Arts style. The building was completed in 1923 after almost a decade of construction, which was protracted by World War I and the resulting shortages of construction materials. At the time of its opening, it was the largest building in Perth. After decades serving as Perth's central post office, Australia Post vacated the building on 22 July 2016. A franchise of clothing retailer H&M; opened in its place in March 2017.  History   Previous postal services  Old Treasury Building at the corner of St Georges Terrace and Barrack Street, the previous home of the Perth General Post Office. In the first year of the colony, the harbourmaster was appointed to perform the postal services for the colony.Ward, p. 6 A General Post Office was proclaimed in St Georges Terrace in 1835, and in 1841 a Postmaster General was appointed. The colonial Posts and Telegraph Department took over control of Perth's telegraph services in 1871, and telephone services in 1889. The Perth General Post Office was relocated to St Georges Terrace between 1887 and 1890, however by 1910 this accommodation was inadequate for the services provided. In 1900 there were 175 post offices across Western Australia, together with 160 telephone exchanges.Ward, p. 8 The Commonwealth took over control of postal and telecommunication services at Federation in 1901.  Construction  On 28 November 1911, the Commonwealth Government bought of land across Wellington Street from the Perth railway station.Ward, p. 15 This land stretched to Murray Street and featured an \\"unhealthy\\" shopping arcade named Central Arcade. The land was to be used as a Commonwealth Government precinct, allowing the Commonwealth departments to move out of the cramped Treasury Buildings at the corner of St Georges Terrace and Barrack Street, which it shared with the State Government.Ward, p. 16 A proposal was made in 1912 for a wide street through the site featuring a new General Post Office building. Principal Architect Hillson Beasley visited Melbourne, where he worked with Commonwealth Architect John Smith Murdoch to design the new General Post Office building. Architectural plans were drawn up and the construction contract with C. W. Arnott signed on 7 July 1914 at a cost of ¬£232,700. These original plans provided for five storeys above ground level, in addition to a basement. Construction commenced in mid-1914, and initially experienced a delay due to sandy soil on the site.Ward, p. 19 The foundation stone was laid by Minister for Home Affairs W. O. Archibald on 8 October 1915. The subsequent outbreak of World War I led to a significant delay in the building's construction. The steel to be used in the construction became subject to an embargo by the British Government in 1916.Molyneux, p. 49 An alternative supply was finally sourced from Broken Hill Proprietary in 1920. Construction was later delayed due to a six-month engineers' strike. The flooring and fittings were originally to be Australian blackwood, however Murdoch substituted jarrah which could be locally sourced. William Hardwick succeeded Beasley as the Principal Architect in 1917 and oversaw the project from that point until its completion.London, p. 69 Although the end date given in the construction contract was October 1917, the building was not nearing completion and this term in the contract was waived. Over the course of construction, the design of the building had been modified several times, largely in an effort to reduce costs. In 1921 it was resolved to add a further two storeys to the top of the building for use by other Commonwealth departments. These additional storeys were to be walled with brickwork, rather than the stone used to clad the rest of the building's facade. However, the side and rear walls of the building were also of brick, and so the brick attic storey \\"tied in\\" with these treatments.Ward, p. 20 The General Post Office was officially opened on 26 September 1923 after around nine years of protracted construction, at a total cost of ¬£400,000.Ephemera held in Battye Library - Australia. Postmaster General's Dept.Souvenir to commemorate the opening of the new General Post Office [Forrest Place], Perth, WA, by H.E. the Governor General...26 September 1923.Also includes invitation card to official opening. The new street in front of the building was ceremonially opened on the same day, and named \\"Forrest Place\\" in honour of the late Sir John Forrest, Western Australia's first Premier.London, p. 14 At its opening, the new General Post Office was Perth's largest building, and it has been said that its imposing design proclaimed \\"the might of the new Commonwealth\\".  Subsequent history  The General Post Office around 1929, viewed from the Perth railway station. The Australia Post shop inside the General Post Office prior to its closure in 2016 The Commonwealth precinct expanded with subsequent construction of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia building immediately south of the General Post Office. It was officially opened on 22 March 1933 by Sir Robert Gibson. It was designed in a similar style to the General Post Office by the architectural staff of the bank, and built by A. Douglas for a tender price of ¬£207,000. The building featured cornice lines and columns of the same style as the General Post Office.Molyneux, p. 56 Another similarly-styled Commonwealth department was planned for the General Post Office's northern side; this was not constructed for many decades, and did not emulate the design of the General Post Office. Forrest Place was closed to traffic in the late 1980s as part of the Forrest Chase development. The Padbury Buildings on the eastern side of Forrest Place, which had been constructed in 1925, were demolished, and the newly created pedestrian mall featured basement parking and loading docks for the General Post Office.Ward, p. 38 The widening of Forrest Place has effectively created a town square dominated by the General Post Office building. On 22 June 1992, the General Post Office was recognised for its heritage value by interim listing on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places; it received a permanent entry on the Register on 16 October 1992. After decades serving as Perth's central post office, Australia Post vacated the building on 22 July 22 2016. A franchise of clothing retailer H&M; opened in its place in March 2017. Australia Post later reopened its central post office on 19 December 2016 at its new permanent location at Perth railway station.  Design  The General Post Office decorated for Christmas The architecture of the General Post Office building has been referred to as High Edwardian Classical and a \\"free treatment of the Greek Renaissance\\". It features a neo-classical facade, featuring Donnybrook stone (a sandstone), including large paired Ionic columns, rising above an arcade lined with Mahogany Creek Granite facing. At the time of its opening, the building was considered to be \\"by far the most ornate structure in the city\\". The interior of the General Post Office was similarly well-finished, with jarrah features throughout. An estimated 600,000 jarrah blocks were used in the herringbone- pattern flooring. The ground floor is fronted by a large colonnade along its entire width.Ward, p. 42 The main postal hall was two storeys high, with balconies from the first floor above. The postal hall also featured a frosted glass roof, above which a lightwell reached to the top of the building. The basement of the General Post Office accommodated vaults and was also used for the handling of bulk parcels. The first floor served as the Mail Room,Ward, p. 49 while the second floor housed executive offices.Ward, p. 52 The third floor housed the State Engineer in addition to the managers and operators of the telephone and telegraph systems.Ward, p. 58 The telegraph operating room was connected to the ground floor by pneumatic tubes. The fourth and fifth floors of the building were originally home to the Taxation Department,Ward, p. 61 and the sixth floor was home to miscellaneous other Federal departments, as well as providing accommodation for Federal Members of Parliament. On the seventh floor was a staff dining room and rest areas. The General Post Office is founded on 1,525 piles in groups of 25, each pile long and in diameter. The building featured four passenger lifts and two goods lifts. The building is constructed by a concrete-encased steel frame, faced with stone and brick. The brick walls did not receive a particularly favourable reception upon the building's opening:  Notes   References  * (\\"London\\") * (\\"Molyneux\\") * (\\"Ward\\")  External links  * Heritage Council of Western Australia -- Places Database entry for the General Post Office  External links - online photographs  * Images of the GPO from various photo collections held by J S Battye Library: ** http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/images/pd095/095,660PD.jpg ** http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/images/wepon/architecture/004023d.jpg ** http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/images/pd095/095,471PD.jpg ** http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/images/pd095/095,474PD.jpg Category:Government buildings completed in 1923 Category:Landmarks in Perth, Western Australia Perth Category:Neoclassical architecture in Australia Category:Sandstone buildings in Australia Category:Commonwealth Heritage List places in Western Australia Category:John Smith Murdoch buildings Category:Forrest Place Category:1923 establishments in Australia Category:State Register of Heritage Places in the City of Perth ","title":"General Post Office, Perth"},{"id":"21606018","text":"thumb Flower Aspidistra elatior, the cast-iron-plant or bar-room plant, also known in Japanese as haran or baran (ËëâËò≠) is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to Japan and Taiwan. Tolerant of neglect, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant, but can also be grown outside in shade where temperatures remain above . It is used as training material for the seika form of ikebana. Description Growing to tall and wide, it is an evergreen rhizomatous perennial, with glossy dark green leaves long, and fleshy, 8-lobed cream flowers with maroon colouring on the inner surface, borne in early summer.  Pollination  According to a study published in 2018, A. elatior appears to be mainly pollinated by fungus gnats (Cordyla sixi and Bradysia spp.). Distribution Although sometimes thought to be of Chinese origin, the species is in fact native to Taiwan and islands in southern Japan including Kuroshima, Suwanosejima and the Uji Islands. It occurs in association with overstorey species such as Ardisia sieboldii and Castanopsis sieboldii. Cultivation A. elatior is well known in cultivation and has a reputation for withstanding neglect, giving rise to its common name of cast-iron plant. It is tolerant of low light, low humidity, temperature fluctuation and irregular watering. It is best situated in a position away from direct sun to avoid leaf bleaching. Good drainage is also required for optimal growth and to avoid root rot. Widely grown as a house plant, it can also be grown successfully outdoors in shade in temperate climates, where plants will generally cope with temperatures down to , being killed by frosts of or below. The species is not seriously troubled by insects, but mites and scale may cause occasional problems. Its leaves and roots may be subject to browsing by hoofed mammals such as deer, as well as rodents and rabbits. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Accident sequence The aircraft, an Aquila Airways Short Solent 3 flying boat named the City of Sydney, registered G-AKNU, departed Southampton Water at 22:46 on a night flight to Las Palmas and Madeira via Lisbon. At 22:54 the crew radioed to report that the number 4 propeller had been feathered (No. 4 engine feathered. Coming back in a hurry.Flight, 8 August 1958, p. 208 ). During an attempt to return, the Solent crashed into a disused chalk pit adjacent to heavily forested downland. The crash site is on a steep eastern slope of Shalcombe Down, above the small villages of Chessell and Shalcombe. At the time of impact the plane was banked 45 degrees to the right, the same side of the aircraft that had lost all engine power according to the accident report. The aircraft caught fire on impact. However three soldiers on a night-exercise were close by when the crash happened and were on the scene within minutes; they managed to rescue some of the survivors from the burning wreckage, suffering burns as they did so. Except for the tail, the aircraft was destroyed. Of the 58 on board, 45 were killed and 13 injured.Flight, 22 November 1957, p. 793 Initially 43 perished, but two more later succumbed to their injuries.Memorial to island plane crash, BBC, 12 October 2008 In the days following, the crash-site became a scene of morbid interest and crowds of people came to see it; a police presence was required to keep them at distance. Possible causes A public inquiry by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the Ministry of TransportNational Archives, Air Ministry and Successors: Civil Aviation Accident Reports concluded that the essential cause remains unknown. The accident was caused by the stoppage of the No.3 engine while the No.4 engine was also stopped. What caused the initial failure of the No.4 engine is unknown. The cause of the subsequent number 3 engine stoppage was either an electrical failure in the fuel cutoff actuator circuit or the accidental operation of the cutoff switch.

Career Early career Hood opened his first studio in 1899, with the main source of income being generated from portraiture and weddings. Hood supplemented this income by selling framed images of sailing vessels to their crews upon arrival in Sydney Harbour. Many of these negatives are now held by the Australian National Maritime Museum, Sydney. Press photographer In 1918 he acquired the Dalny Studio at 124 Pitt Street, and began to expand his business into press photography, providing photographs for The Sydney Mail, The Australasian, the Daily Guardian, the Daily Telegraph Pictorial, the Labor Daily, The Sun, the Daily News, and The Sydney Morning Herald. Press photography increasingly came to dominate his business, and in 1934 he joined the Labor Daily for a short time as a full-time photographer, engaging other staff to look after his studio. At the beginning of Hood's career photography in newspapers was a novelty, and although the technology to reproduce half tone illustrations was in use by 1880 the Australian papers and in particular wood engravers whose job it was to illustrate articles resisted the new process. The Sydney Morning Herald did not reproduce a photograph until 1908. Sam Hood is acknowledged as a trailblazer in this genre - becoming adept at capturing the sensational, trivial and in particular sporting moments with his camera. A number of photographers worked for Dalny Studio: some of these include Ernie Bowen, Gus Daley, Jack Lazern, Lethington Maitland as well as Sam's own children Gladys and Ted.

Acrobats, Sydney, 1930s Sam Hood (Possibly John M. Hendry, bodybuilder and physical culture writer.) By the mid-1930s most newspapers employed their own photographers, and Hood's commissions from the papers began to decline. He sought other kinds of commissions, and won a number of long term advertising and commercial contracts. He contributed a number of photographs of Sydney buildings and streets to Building, Construction and Australasian Engineer during the late 1930s and early 1940s. Hood also had extensive contacts in the entertainment industry, who called upon him to document celebrity events and stars, as well as theatre advertising. Throughout his career he worked at the stock-in-trade for commercial photographers: portraits, weddings and even funerals. Collected work The State Library of New South Wales acquired a collection of negatives from Hood's daughter Gladys Hood in 1973 comprising some 30,000 images. Hood's story is documented in a volume produced by that institution and there are several images from that collection of Hood with cameras and accessories included in this acquisition.

Geographical location  This small village is in the North East of Mansehra city and in south to the New-Balakot. The village is located on Mansehra Kaghan Road/ N-15 National Highway, which connect Mansehra with Kaghan, Naran and Chilas. It is about 12 km from Mansehra on Naran Road. It is almost a four-hour drive from the capital Islamabad. The village is one of the places inhabited by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake affectees from Balakot and other places.  Cultural diversity and environment  The village has a number of different ethnic groups, including Swati, Gujar, Sayyeds and Afghans. This diversity is also reflected in the languages spoken in the village, which include Hindko, Pashto and Urdu. An historical shrin, the \\"Sinjlian shrin\\", and historical ruins are located in the forest of the village. An old water mill is also located on the rain water stream. The village is in a small valley surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. One of the most prominent peaks in Pakistan, Musa ka Musala, is visible from the village. Health and education facilities After the 2005 earthquake, the village was one of the main focus to the rehabilitation facilities. A charity based eye-hospital was established by Layton Rahmatulla Benevolent Trust, which treat patients from all over the Mansehra. Similarly, a Model school was opened by the Muslim Hands organisation, called the Muslim Hands School of Excellence. The primary objective was to provide quality education to the orphans. Considering the quality of education in the school, many parents are interested to provide education to their children on charged basis. Very recently, a children hospital has also been established in the village. A government high school is also located in the village for girls and a primary school for boys, contributing to the literacy of its inhabitants.

The lower reaches of river was canalised in 1946 and a causeway built over Loe Marsh in 1987.Le. Messurier, B. and Luck, L. (1998) Loe Pool and Mount's Bay. No. 12 in The National Trust Coast of Cornwall series of leaflets. The meaning of the name is uncertain, but two of the earliest records are: \\"in 1260 we find, 'Chohor' [alternately known as in non-unified , meaning 'scarlet river'], due to its earlier colour from mining waste and a few years later, 'Coffar'\\". The present name 'Cober' is unlikely to be derived from 'Coffar', since it was known as the 'River Loe or River Looe' around four hundred years ago, in Carew's time, according to the map of Powder Hundred. History A common belief is that until the 13th century the River Cober ran directly to sea, until its mouth became blocked by a deposition of sand which formed Loe Bar and created Loe Pool.Bere, Rennie (1982) The Nature of Cornwall. Buckingham: Barracuda Books; pp. 15, 66, 69 Loe Bar was most likely created by eustatic sea level rise after the last ice age. The rising sea level pushed a large amount of sediment into the mouth of the river, blocking it and creating a barrier beach.May, V.J. Loe Bar. In May, V.J. and Hansom, J.D. (2003) Coastal Geomorphology of Great Britain, Geological Conservation Review Series, No. 28, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Peterborough, 754 pp. Loe Bar consists mainly of flint, a rock not found in Cornwall; the nearest onshore source is in east Devon, away. The most likely source of flint is found offshore; the drowned terraces of a former river that flowed between England and France and is now under the English Channel. In the 1870s, a total of ¬£3000 was spent by the ‚Ä≥Porkellis-moor- adventure‚Ä≥ on the exploration of china clay deposits on Porkellis Moor. A bakehouse-flue and large tanks were built, but in 1879 the adventurers sold by auction their holdings and in 1884 the works were derelict.

These markers are usually staked out according to a suitable coordinate system selected for the project.  History of construction surveying  * The nearly perfect squareness and north‚Äìsouth orientation of the Great Pyramid of Giza, built c. 2700 BC, affirm the Egyptians' command of surveying. *A recent reassessment of Stonehenge (c.2500 BC) suggests that the monument was set out by prehistoric surveyors using peg and rope geometry.Johnson, Anthony, Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma. (Thames & Hudson, 2008) *In the sixth century BC geometric based techniques were used to construct the tunnel of Eupalinos on the island of Samos. *Modern technology advanced surveying's accuracy and efficiency. For example, surveyors used to use two posts joined with a chain to measure distance. This technology could only account for distance and not elevation. Current technology uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) that can measure the distance from point A to point B as well as differences in elevation. Elements of the construction survey * Survey existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and underground infrastructure whenever possible (for example, measuring invert elevations and diameters of sewers at manholes) * Stake out lot corners, stake limit of work and stake location of construction trailer (clear of all excavation and construction) * Stake out reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures * Verify the location of structures during construction * Provide horizontal control on multiple floors * Conduct an As-Built survey: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans Coordinate systems used in construction Land surveys and surveys of existing conditions are generally performed according to geodesic coordinates. However, for the purposes of construction a more suitable coordinate system will often be used. During construction surveying, the surveyor will often have to convert from geodesic coordinates to the coordinate system used for that project.  Chainage or station  In the case of roads or other linear infrastructure, a chainage (derived from Gunter's Chain - 1 chain is equal to 66 feet or 100 links) will be established, often to correspond with the centre line of the road or pipeline. During construction, structures would then be located in terms of chainage, offset and elevation. Offset is said to be \\"left\\" or \\"right\\" relative to someone standing on the chainage line who is looking in the direction of increasing chainage. Plans would often show plan views (viewed from above), profile views (a \\"transparent\\" section view collapsing all section views of the road parallel to the chainage) or cross-section views (a \\"true\\" section view perpendicular to the chainage). In a plan view, chainage generally increases from left to right, or from the bottom to the top of the plan. Profiles are shown with the chainage increasing from left to right, and cross- sections are shown as if the viewer is looking in the direction of increasing chainage (so that the \\"left\\" offset is to the left and the \\"right\\" offset is to the right). \\"Chainage\\" may also be referred to as \\"Station\\". Building grids In the case of buildings, an arbitrary system of grids is often established so as to correspond to the rows of columns and the major load- bearing walls of the building. The grids may be identified alphabetically in one direction, and numerically in the other direction (as in a road map). The grids are usually but not necessarily perpendicular, and are often but not necessarily evenly spaced. Floors and basement levels are also numbered. Structures, equipment or architectural details may be located in reference to the floor and the nearest intersection of the arbitrary axes.  Other coordinate systems In other types of construction projects, arbitrary \\"plan north\\" reference lines may be established, using Cartesian coordinates that may or may not necessarily correspond to true coordinates. The technique is called localized grid. This method uses the plan building grids as their own ordinates. A point of beginning is established at the southwest cross grid. IE [N1000.000,E3000.000] The grids are added together heading north and east to make each line its own ordinate. Equipment and techniques used in construction surveying Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have supplemented (and to a large extent supplanted) the traditional optical instruments. The builder's level measures neither horizontal nor vertical angles. It simply combines a spirit level and telescope to allow the user to visually establish a line of sight along a level plane. When used together with a graduated staff it can be used to transfer elevations from one location to another. An alternative method to transfer elevation is to use water in a transparent hose as the level of the water in the hose at opposite ends will be at the same elevation. A double right angle prism verifies grid patterns, isolating layout errors. Equipment and techniques used in mining and tunneling Total stations are the primary survey instrument used in mining surveying. Underground mining A total station is used to record the absolute location of the tunnel walls' (stopes), ceilings (backs), and floors as the drifts of an underground mine are driven. The recorded data is then downloaded into a CAD programme, and compared to the designed layout of the tunnel. The survey party installs control stations at regular intervals. These are small steel plugs installed in pairs in holes drilled into walls or the back. For wall stations, two plugs are installed in opposite walls, forming a line perpendicular to the drift. For back stations, two plugs are installed in the back, forming a line parallel to the drift. A set of plugs can be used to locate the total station set up in a drift or tunnel by processing measurements to the plugs by intersection and resection.  Profession  Building Surveying emerged in the 1970s as a profession in the United Kingdom by a group of technically minded General Practice Surveyors. Building Surveying is a recognized profession within Britain and Australia. In Australia in particular, due to risk mitigation/limitation factors the employment of surveyors at all levels of the construction industry is widespread. There are still many countries where it is not widely recognized as a profession. The Services that Building Surveyors undertake are broad but include: *Construction design and building works *Project Management and monitoring *CDM Co-ordinator under the Construction (Design & Management) Regulations 2015 *Property Legislation adviser *Insurance assessment and claims assistance *Defect investigation and maintenance adviser *Building Surveys and measured surveys *Handling Planning applications *Building Inspection to ensure compliance with building regulations *Undertaking pre- acquisition surveys *Negotiating dilapidations claims Building Surveyors also advise on many aspects of construction including: * design * maintenance * repair * refurbishment * restoration * conservation Clients of a building surveyor can be the public sector, Local Authorities, Government Departments as well as private sector organisations and work closely with architects, planners, homeowners and tenants groups. Building Surveyors may also be called to act as an expert witness. It is usual for building surveyors to undertake an accredited degree qualification before undertaking structured training to become a member of a professional organisation. For Chartered Building Surveyors, these courses are accredited by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Other professional organisations that have building surveyor members include CIOB, ABE, HKIS and RICS. With the enlargement of the European community, the profession of the Chartered Building Surveyor is becoming more widely known in other European states, particularly France. Chartered Building Surveyors, where many English speaking people buy second homes. Distinction from land surveyors In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a distinct profession. Land surveyors have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary (also known as cadastral) surveys for * creating new boundaries sanctioned by landowners by way of subdivision plans or plats, and for * relocating the boundaries of existing land parcels using legal descriptions, registered documents, surveyors' field notes and plans, and evidence of monumentation and other marks on or under ground.

The screenplay concerns a British woman on a visit to post-war Berlin, who is caught up in an espionage ring smuggling secrets into and out of the Eastern Bloc. Plot Susanne Mallison (Claire Bloom) arrives at Tempelhof Airport to the post-war but pre-wall West Berlin, at that point still generally open to East Berlin. She looks around the war-ravaged city with her sister-in-law Bettina, including the ruins of the Reichstag. After a night in a nightclub they plan to visit the eastern sector the next day. Entry is simple, and they show their papers and a barrier lifts to give them entry. The atmosphere is different, with huge posters of Stalin decorating the buildings. There they bump into Ivo Kern in a cafe. They return to the west sector and Susanne visits Martin her brother (Bettina's husband), who is on military duties overseeing supplies to the city. Susanne starts dating Ivo. He confesses that he once was in love with Bettina. He arrives to collect her in a VW Beetle and they go skating. The sinister Halendar appears almost each time they meet. Bettina confesses to both Martin and Susanne that she was married to Ivo until 1943. Martin and a friend plot to kidnap Ivo but he guesses this and sends a boy to leave a sign in the snow that he is not coming. Susanne goes out in the snow and is bundled into a car. Ivo argues with Hallendar saying he has kidnapped the wrong woman. Ivo Kern (James Mason) is a former lawyer who has participated in Nazi atrocities and is now selling his expertise to East Germans to kidnap and transport certain West Germans to the Eastern bloc. Although Kern desires to relocate to the West, he is hampered by West German suspicions and his criminal past. Nevertheless, he agrees to a final kidnapping venture that fails, forcing his employer to take over and abduct Briton Susanne Mallison (Claire Bloom) by mistake. Kern had earlier feigned a romance with Mallison as a means to seize his kidnapping target. The abduction of Mallison presents Kern with an opportunity to both return the unfortunate victim to the West and impress Western authorities with his atonement. Despite Kern's selfish and dark facade, Mallison falls in love with him. She tells him that she can see humanity deep inside a man who had once wished to defend the innocent and the 'rights of man'. This glimpse also appears to a young East Berlin boy who assists Kern and Mallison in their attempt to escape, as he follows Kern everywhere and the boy is treated with kindness. Kern almost admits his affection for Mallison on one occasion but he directs the conversation back to his sordid past and the escape attempt. Ivo and Susanne narrowly avoid capture and wander through the ruins of East Berlin. They try to board a train at Friedrichstrasse but there are too many ID checks. They sabotage a generator to kill the lights to cross a large building site. The message boy (Horst) appears on the east side (it is not explained how he crosses the border). Ivo persuades a woman to give them her flat for the night. They kiss for the first time.. it is implied they sleep together. The boy comes to the flat with a laundry lorry driven by Kestner. They hide in the back as it drives to the crossing point. They hold each other. Ultimately, as Kern and Mallison are only a few feet from the Berlin gate while hidden in the back of a truck, the truck breaks down. Kerstner gets it restarted but has drawn attention to the lorry. Kern jumps out of the back and is chased by the border guards as he runs from the vehicle. As the truck crosses the neutral zone Kern tries to reach the back and she reaches back for his hand, but he is gunned down by the guards, and in doing so he gives his life to save hers.

Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote: \\"It must be said, without reflection, that the credit for whatever there is in the way of exciting melodrama in this primarily atmospheric film goes to Mr. Reed for his direction of the actors and camera. For it is the attitudes of his people, the moods of the city in various scenes and the cleverness of the assembly, rather than the sharpness of the story told, that account for the modest distinction on the quality level of The Man Between.\\" References External links * Category:1953 films Category:1950s spy thriller films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British films Category:British spy thriller films Category:Cold War spy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Carol Reed Category:Films scored by John Addison Category:Films set in Berlin Category:Films shot in Berlin Category:Films with screenplays by Harry Kurnitz ","title":"The Man Between"},{"id":"21606167","text":"Frederick C.

Ashendon Junction is centre left, where the Great Western (yellow) and Great Central (pink) diverge Ashendon Junction in Buckinghamshire, England, was a major mainline railway junction where, from July 1910, the Great Western Railway's (GWR) London- Birmingham direct route diverged from the Great Central Railway's (GCR) main London-Sheffield route. It was near the small village of Ashendon, about 10 miles north-east of Oxford. The junction was where what is now the Chiltern Main Line (formerly the \\"Birmingham Direct Line\\" aka \\"Bicester cut-off\\" of the GWR), inaugurated in 1910, joined the post-1906 \\"Alternative Route\\" alignment of the GCR. It was located north-west of today's ; from London Paddington via Northolt Junction, and from London Marylebone via Neasden and Northolt Junctions. It was a high-speed flying junction carrying southbound GWR trains from Birmingham via Bicester North (Engineer's Line Reference NAJ2) on an embankment with a girder bridge over the top of northbound Great Central trains travelling from London Marylebone on to the 90 mph five-mile link to Grendon Underwood Junction (Engineer's Line Reference GUA) where they rejoined the original Great Central Main Line towards Brackley and beyond to the East Midlands and North. Closure When the Great Central was closed south of Rugby in September 1966, the junction became redundant and the trackwork was later dismantled. The link to Grendon Underwood was already relatively little used by then, at least as far as passenger trains were concerned, most services from Marylebone towards Brackley and beyond using the original GC route through Aylesbury after long-distance expresses were ended in 1960. Few signs of the old Great Central lines can now be seen from ground level on the site of the junction itself, but the trackbed is clearly visible from the air.Ashendon Junction at Bing Maps (select \\"Aerial View\\"). Immediately north of the site, the Great Central trackbed towards Grendon Underwood is still intact. Little other evidence remains, except that over the best part of a mile the twin tracks of the Chiltern route still diverge at this point, a relic of the old layout preserved when Chiltern Railways redoubled the line between and Aynho Junction in 1998, it having been singled in the late 1960s.

The Australian Government has also put in many exercise related plans such as the Governor's 30 Day Family Challenge and the many fun runs.  Being active  The Australian Government has promoted being active for them to save money on hospitals so they can re-direct that into more important things like the current recession and re-building the destroyed homes and lives of the Black Saturday victims.  The 4 guidelines  The guidelines are directed at adults (scroll lower for children's guidelines). 1\\\\. See movement as an opportunity, not an inconvenience. 2\\\\. Be active every day in as many ways as possible. 3\\\\. Put together at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity on most, preferably all days. 4\\\\. If it is possible, enjoy some regular vigorous activity for extra health and fun.  The types of physical activity  Occupational Activity - This type of activity is sustained from all exercise undertaken at a place of work. This could include running/walking up and down stairs or if for labourers, the hard labour that is undertaken. This also includes schools for children. Active Transport - This means that the activity undertaken instead of driving a car. Alternatives include walking, running, or riding a bike or many other fun activities to get from point A to point B. Leisure Time Activity - This includes all of the activity included in an individual's leisure time. It could be taking leisurely walks or doing sports such as football or soccer. It also includes doing exercise to keep fit like running and going to the gym to work out. Household/Gardening Activity - This consists of all the exercise achieved by doing chores around the house and in the garden. i.e. mowing the lawn, and vacuuming the house.  NPAG table  Children (5‚Äì12) ‚Äì At least 60 minutes (up to several hours is recommended) of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day, with focus on developing motor skills and having fun ‚Äì no more than two hours per day surfing the net, watching TV or playing video games. Youth (12‚Äì18) ‚Äì At least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day and no more than two hours using electronic media (unless educational). Overweight and obese ‚Äì Begin slowly, working up to 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity, being sure to not overdo it to cause injury, then increase to 60‚Äì90 minutes to avoid weight gain. Older people ‚Äì Should follow Adult guidelines ‚Äì strength and balance training also recommended.  Diseases  High blood pressure, hypertension - One-third of all cases of high blood pressure are associated with obesity. High blood pressure is twice as common in adults who are obese than in those who are at a healthy weight. High blood cholesterol - 50% more likely to have elevated blood cholesterol levels. Diabetes Type 2 - Non-insulin dependent accounts for nearly 90% of all cases of diabetes. Researchers estimate that 88 to 97% of type 2 diabetes cases diagnosed in overweight people are a direct result of obesity. Congestive heart failure - Obesity increases the risk of congestive heart failure, a potentially fatal condition in which the heart muscle weakens, progressively losing the ability to pump blood. Heart disease - Heart attack, congestive heart failure, sudden cardiac death, angina or chest pain, and abnormal heart rhythm is increased in persons who are overweight or obese. Stroke - There is a link between obesity and stroke; this is particularly the case for people whose fat is situated predominantly in the abdominal region. Overweight people are more likely to have high blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure, but these associations are not the only explanations for the greater stroke rate. Gallstones and gall bladder disorders Gout - The chance this condition may develop in people with obesity incidents are remarkably higher than people who are at a healthy weight, gout is strongly associated with obesity. Osteoarthritis - Obesity may be a major factor in the development of osteoarthritis, particularly of the knee and especially in women. Cancer -Duch as endometrial, breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Complications of pregnancy Poor female reproductive health - Examples would be menstrual irregularities, infertility, and irregular ovulation. Bladder control problems - Such as stress incontinence. Psychological disorders -Such as depression, eating disorders, distorted body image, and low self-esteem.

The Nara Schools  The early Nara Buddhism schools provided different opinions as to how to obtain rebirth in the Pure Land, though in some cases, such as the Hoss≈ç school taught that icchantikas (people who committed the Five Grave Acts) could not obtain rebirth ever. Other schools taught that while accessible to all, the rituals involved were difficult, or that rebirth was not desirable.

Mullock came from an Anglo-Irish family; his family's firm in Wales, Henry Mullock & Son, was a printers based on Commercial Street in Newport, South Wales.Smith (1980), pg 36. Early sporting ambitions Mullock had a history of connections with sports clubs around Newport and in 1874 became the secretary of the Newport Athletic Club. In 1879 the South Wales Football Club, which represented the interests of Welsh rugby union, attempted to organise a group of matches between a South Wales team and clubs representing Blackheath F.C., West of Scotland F.C., Oxford University and the South of Ireland. Mullock, wishing to improve the profile of his Newport club, secured a match against Blackheath before the S.W.F.C. could finalise any arrangements, stealing their fixture. Oxford University and West of Scotland lost interest in a match with either organisation, while a team from South of Ireland played a match against Newport on 18 November 1879, a day before the match with the S.W.F.U. By 1880 the S.W.F.U. was losing face as a governing body, with teams pulling out of matches after embarrassing fixture clashes and a lack of firm commitments. The creation of a Welsh national team A meeting was held in the Tenby Hotel in Swansea in 1880, organised between rugby union clubs in an attempt to produce a representative team to face the English national team.Smith (1980), pg 37. Little was gained from the meeting, but it did produce an agreed desire from the parties present to meet with the English Rugby Football Union to arrange a match between Wales and England. Mullock became the architect of this movement and it was through him that the RFU arranged a fixture with a Welsh team on 8 January 1881. Mullock arranged a set of trials in December 1880 to choose the team that would face England, to be captained by Cambridge University player James Bevan.Smith (1980), pg 39. Mullock (back row in bowler hat) with the first Welsh team, 1881 The selection performance of the first Welsh team was contentious, with Mullock choosing a geographically varied team of educated men, most of whom most were linked to the older colleges. The original date of 8 January was postponed to 22 January, which in turn was cancelled due to frost. Mullock was concerned that the lack of a fixture date would lead towards the same accusations of incompetence levelled at the S.W.F.U., and accepted a date of 19 February even though it fell a day before a cup semi-final between Swansea and Llanelli.Smith (1980), pg 40. On the day of the match two of the players chosen to represent Wales failed to show for the game. The missing players later complained that there was little definite communication between Mullock and themselves. The match itself was a one sided affair, with the English winning by a score of 8‚Äì0, through seven goals, a dropped goal and six tries to nil. This was a terrible defeat for the Welsh and when the backlash came from the press, Mullock discovered that he was the only Welsh executive and was carrying the responsibility for the defeat. The Western Mail ran several editorials asking whether the match was an affiliated team endorsed by the S.W.F.U. or a private team organised by Mullock. The S.W.F.U. distanced themselves from the match, allowing the responsibility to fall on Mullock; though this tactic was ill conceived, as the rugby clubs appeared to prefer Mullock's positive approach rather than the S.W.F.U.'s inactivity. These events led to the formation of the Welsh Football Union, later to be named the Welsh Rugby Union, at the Castle Hotel in Neath on 12 March 1881.Smith (1980), pg 41. The S.W.F.U. failed to attend the meeting, which led to their dissolution as the WFU was accepted as the official representative union of the Welsh clubs. Secretary of the Welsh Football Union The four major Welsh clubs, Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Llanelli were all in favour of the new direction Mullock was taking rugby in Wales and gave their support to the formation of the WFU.Smith (1980), pg 42. Swansea in particular were impressed with Mullock and commended him for his organisation of the Welsh team, despite the heavy defeat. At the meeting, with the support of Swansea, Mullock was installed as the first secretary of the Welsh Football Union, who in turn proposed Swansea's Cyril Chambers as president.Smith (1980), pg 43. By September 1882, Mullock was not only the WFU secretary and treasurer, but was installed as one of the four regional selectors for the Welsh national team, representing the Newport area.Smith (1980), pg 47. Mullock, although enthusiastic as a sporting organiser was a poor accountant, and a bad choice for treasurer. At the end of the 1882‚Äì3 season, the Union had received roughly ¬£96 in receipts, but had had spent over ¬£215, roughly a quarter of this amount spent on hotel bills attempting to impress RFU delegates. It was Mullock's poor fiscal abilities that would later remove him from his posts within the WFU. In 1891 at Llanelli's AGM, the club secretary, Gavin Henry, stated that after the 1891 Home Nations match at Stradey Park, where Wales faced Ireland, Mullock had taken the gate receipts without paying Llanelli's costs. Henry wrote several letters to Mullock but did not receive a response, resulting in Henry meeting the costs himself.Smith (1980), pg 52. Henry called for Mullock to be 'deposed' from his position within the WFU. At the 1890-1 WFU annual meeting, Swansea's William Gwynn, challenged Mullock's position and demanded that he step down on the grounds of financial mismanagement. While Tom Williams of Neath complained that Mullock, as treasurer, had not provided a balance sheet for members since 1884. Gwynn called for Mullock to be replaced as Secretary by Walter E. Rees; but Rees withdrew after W.D. Phillips and Horace Lyne argued Mullock's case, reminding the members how Mullock financed the Union in its early years. Mullock retained his position as Secretary but stood down as Treasurer in favour of William Wilkins. The next season saw the end of Mullock as WFU Secretary; when an incident involving a Swansea player in a game at Exeter, resulted in a request by the RFU for the player concerned to write a letter of apology. Many WFU members felt that Mullock had grovelled towards the RFU during the affair and in September 1892, Mullock was no longer Secretary.Smith (1980), pg 53. As rugby referee Mullock also officiated for rugby union matches, and was umpire in several international matches, including the 1884 Home Nations Championship clash between Scotland and Wales. His opposite partner on the line at the same game was JA Gardener, secretary of the Scottish Rugby Union and the referee was James MacLaren, President of the RFU.Godwin (1984), pg 6. In 1886 as part of the Home Nations Championship, Mullock was selected to referee an international game between England and Ireland. This followed on from the previous year when Horace Lyne had refereed the same fixture between the nations. England won both matches by a try, and the fact that two members of the WFU were seen to have 'had a hand' in Irish defeats caused an already strained relationship between Wales and Ireland to worsen.Smith (1980), pg 63. In both the 1885 and 1886 Championships, Ireland refused to play Wales. Personal history Mullock was born in 1851 in Newport, South Wales to Henry Mullock and Henrietta Oliver. The family ran a printing company and published the local paper, The Newport Advertiser. Mullock was one of at least four siblings, including younger brother William and sisters Julia and Helen. Mullock married and had six children, though apart from a daughter, Dorothy, there is little information on his family.Mullock family history treanor.co.uk In 1893 the affairs off Mullock became public as he strived to fight off bankruptcy orders, with the local courts deeming him ¬£2,000 in debt. In 1902, Mullock was declared bankrupt and emigrated that year to Africa. He died in 1920.

The screenplay concerns a young man who runs away from home, joins the navy and goes to sea in the 1790s. He rescues a captive woman from a Spanish ship and battles pirates and smugglers. The film was based on the novel Mr Midshipman Easy (1836) by Frederick Marryat. Production The film was made at Ealing Studios by Basil Dean's Associated Talking Pictures. The film was a moderate success on its initial release in Britain. It was first released in the United States in 1951 by Astor Pictures.

The film stars Dane Clark, Alexis Smith, Zachary Scott and Eve Arden.. Plot The film opens with a middle-weight bout in Madison Square Garden, New York City, where Mike Angelo battles a seemingly superior opponent. He's going down for the count when he's saved by the bell. Cut to Mike Gordon, a happy-go-lucky painter in California, upset that cafe owner Sam has let customer Laurie Rogers buy a painting hanging on the wall. Mike is unsatisfied with his work and confronts Laurie to get it back. She convinces him it's good if not perfect, so Mike invites her to dinner. After a romantic dinner and swim in the ocean, they've got a date for breakfast. When a shady character enters Sam's cafe, Laurie abruptly leaves town. At her hotel, Mike sees the painting wrapped and addressed to Dr. Vincent, New York City. Sam gives Mike money to go to New York. Later, in his Greenwich Village artist's studio, Mike's neighbor Christine invites Mike out to the Pelican Club, a pricey night spot. Although Christine's plan to get him a portrait commission backfires, Laurie appears in a spotlight to sing. Mike goes to her dressingroom, where hoodlums attack him. He knocks one guy out, but gets hit over the head by a goon named Costello. He's carried unconscious to the boss's office. Club owner Rex Durant, a crippled ex-boxer, is impressed that Mike just knocked out a middle- weight contender. Durant offers to make a champion of him. The only hitch: Laurie is actually Mrs. Durant. Mike resents Laurie's having lied to him. Next day at the gym, Mike is examined by Dr. Vincent, who's got the painting hanging in his office. He's Laurie's brother. This is a tight-knit dysfunctional clan. Mike trains to be a prizefighter to get Laurie out of his system, becoming enmeshed in Durant's sadistic schemes. Dr. Vincent reveals that when he failed to fix Durant's legs after a car accident, Durant preyed on his guilt and manipulated Laurie into staying married. Dr. Vincent decides to kill Durant to liberate Laurie, but Mike thwarts him, confronting Durant himself. Costello gives Mike a concussion. A fight now would be suicide, but Durant promises Mike if he wins the big bout, Laurie will be free. Durant wants him dead because he knows Laurie loves Mike. Now we're back to that opening sequence in the Garden. Woozy and taking a beating, Mike nonetheless triumphs in the ring before being sent to the hospital. Dr. Vincent goes after Durant and is shot by Costello but manages to shoot Durant, whose wheelchair careens out of Madison Square Garden into an oncoming taxi.

From 1927 to 1956, he was the Astor Professor of English History at University College London. Academic career Neale was trained by the political historian A. F. Pollard.Short biography of Neale, in Neale, J. (1971) Queen Elizabeth I. Pelican. His first professional appointment was the chair of Modern History at the University of Manchester, and he was then to succeed his old mentor A. F. Pollard as Astor Professor of English History at University College London in 1927. He was to hold this post until 1956. In 1955, Neale was knighted, and on 17 November 1958 he delivered a lecture in Washington, D.C. commemorating Elizabeth I's accession to the English throne four hundred years previously. From 1956, Neale was Professor Emeritus, but continued to do some academic teaching at University College London. Sir John Neale's grave, Harrogate Cemetery He died in 1975 and was buried in Harrogate Cemetery. He had married Elfreda Skelton of Harrogate with whom he had a daughter, Stella. Historical views Neale was the leading Elizabethan historian of his generation.Patrick Collinson, ‚ÄòNeale, Sir John Ernest (1890‚Äì1975)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 17 May 2015. In the opinion of fellow historian, and Neale's own graduate student, Patrick Collinson, Neale's biography of Elizabeth I \\"has yet to be bettered\\".Patrick Collinson, ‚ÄòElizabeth I (1533‚Äì1603)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2012, accessed 17 May 2015. His painstaking research uncovered the political power of the gentry in The Elizabethan House of Commons (1949), whilst his 1948 Raleigh Lecture on ‚ÄòThe Elizabethan political scene‚Äô greatly expanded our knowledge of the politics of the reign. The two volumes on Elizabeth I and her Parliaments (1953 and 1957) explored the relationship between the Queen and her Parliaments. These were criticised by Sir Geoffrey Elton who claimed that the main preoccupation of these parliaments was the forming of Bills and the passing of Acts, not conflict between Crown and Parliament.G. R. Elton, 'Parliament in the Sixteenth Century: Functions and Fortunes', The Historical Journal, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Jun., 1979), pp. 255-278. Neale's claims that these parliaments were a landmark in the evolution of Parliament was criticised by medievalists such as J. S. Roskell.J. S. Roskell, 'Perspectives in English Parliamentary History', Bulletin of the John Rylands Library, XLVI (1964), pp. 448-475. However Collinson notes that the conflicts which Neale wrote about did take place and that Neale's retelling of them made an exciting and unforgettable chapter in English history. Neale is well known for his thesis on the Elizabethan Puritan Choir, in which he claimed that a group of Puritan MPs successfully managed to force Elizabeth's hand on many policy issues throughout her reign, including at the start. Neale is also recognised for his work in bringing to light new sources on Tudor England, and developing different ways of studying the period.

(Here the term calculus should be understood in its broader sense of \\"a system of computation\\", rather than in the sense of differential calculus and integral calculus.) Its roots can be traced to Fourier's concept of dimensional analysis (1822). The basic axiom of quantity calculus is Maxwell's description of a physical quantity as the product of a \\"numerical value\\" and a \\"reference quantity\\" (i.e. a \\"unit quantity\\" or a \\"unit of measurement\\"). De Boer summarized the multiplication, division, addition, association and commutation rules of quantity calculus and proposed that a full axiomatization has yet to be completed. Measurements are expressed as products of a numeric value with a unit symbol, e.g. \\"12.7 m\\". Unlike algebra, the unit symbol represents a measurable quantity such as a meter, not an algebraic variable. A careful distinction needs to be made between abstract quantities and measurable quantities. The multiplication and division rules of quantity calculus are applied to SI base units (which are measurable quantities) to define SI derived units, including dimensionless derived units, such as the radian (rad) and steradian (sr) which are useful for clarity, although they are both algebraically equal to 1. Thus there is some disagreement about whether it is meaningful to multiply or divide units. Emerson suggests that if the units of a quantity are algebraically simplified, they then are no longer units of that quantity. Johansson proposes that there are logical flaws in the application of quantity calculus, and that the so- called dimensionless quantities should be understood as \\"unitless quantities\\". How to use quantity calculus for unit conversion and keeping track of units in algebraic manipulations is explained in the handbook on Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry.

The show taped its first season in February 2009, and debuted on September 28, 2009. The show's format was adapted from the Japanese game show Brain Survivor. The U.S. version was created by Scott A. Stone, creator of kids' game shows Legends of the Hidden Temple, Fun House, Paradise Run, and The Mole, and Clay Newbill, executive producer of The Mole and Shark Tank. The network announced on February 18, 2010 that the program was renewed for a second season, consisting of 40 episodes, and featuring the same format without any changes.Nick renews 'BrainSurge' The second season, which featured the 40 original episodes plus one episode held over from season one, premiered on June 21, 2010. The third season started airing on July 18, 2011 on Nick at Nite, marketed as Family BrainSurge, and had a two-person family team format with five teams. The third season ran until November 17, 2011, when the show was canceled. The remaining episodes aired on Nicktoons from April 28 to May 9, 2014. BrainSurge was taped at Hollywood Center Studios in Hollywood, California. The series was adapted for Latin American and Brazilian audiences as Veloz Mente, which premiered on Discovery Kids on November 7, 2011. The puerto rican's audiences premiered on WIPR-TV on May 4, 2020. and premiered on Kids TV PR on June 20, 2020. This version is hosted by Mariano Chiesa. In 2012, the show was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show, but lost to Jeopardy!. Format BrainSurge's challenges are designed to test the memory and comprehension skills of its contestants. Level One: Brain Tease The contestants/teams begin by playing a series of visual puzzles. There were 6 (sometimes 5) puzzles in season 1, worth 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 points each (for a maximum of 250 points); in season 2, the 40-point puzzle was dropped (except in an episode that was delayed from season 1); in season 3 (Family BrainSurge), there are four puzzles, worth 10, 25, 50, and 100 points. Each solution is a number that the players need to enter using their keypads. The contestants/teams have 10 seconds to lock in their answers. The four highest-scoring contestants/teams advance to the next round the two/one teams/contestants is eliminated, but receives a consolation prize and a bucket of slime (the bucket of slime was dropped for Family Brainsurge). Ties are broken by how quickly the contestants/teams entered their answers. In Family Brainsurge, if the teams tied for last place had a score of 0 points, a tiebreaker puzzle is played instead and the team who correctly answers it the fastest will advance. All eliminated contestants/teams in this and future levels are sent down the \\"Brain Drain\\", a slide formed as a human ear containing foam. Level Two: Brain Fart During the second round, the four remaining contestants/teams are told a story from a book read by the host and are asked questions in turn about the story. Contestants/teams lock in their answers by sitting down on a chair. If a contestant/team gets a question right, a ding sound is heard. If a contestant/team gets a question wrong (or if they fail to answer), the chair makes a farting noise, and the contestant/team is pulled backwards through a paper \\"tooth\\" (curtains in Season 2 or later) of a large face (made to resemble host Sutphen) and eliminated from further play. This continues until two contestants/teams remain. In Family BrainSurge, each team is allowed one \\"Brain Fart\\", which allows two other members of the family (the \\"Brain Trust\\") to offer an answer for the team; the team stays in the game or is eliminated based on that answer. There were two types of questions used in Level 2. One type involved who, what, where, when, and why type questions about events in the story (in this type, if a question is missed the next player/team will be asked the same question, but sometimes a new question in season 1) and the other type involved players/teams naming things that Jeff listed in the story (e.g. name the musical instruments mentioned in the story) and in this type repeating an already said answer, including another form of that answer, counted as a wrong answer. On \\"Family BrainSurge\\", if all the answers in the naming type questions are used up before two teams are eliminated, then Jeff will ask tiebreaker questions using who, what, and where type questions, and teams cannot use their Brain Farts during a tiebreaker (any unused Brain Farts are out of play when the tiebreaker starts). Knockout Round In the Knockout round, the two remaining contestants/teams have ten seconds to memorize a grid of 16 numbers containing 8 pairs of images from the story. The contestants/teams then take turns matching pairs of images from the story. if a contestant make a mistake than the game will go to a sudden death which whoever make a match move on; if no contestant makes a mistake, the contestant who made the last correct match wins the game. At this point, the losing contestant's chair does the same thing as if a question is wrong. The contestant/team that lost in this round and the 2 eliminated contestants/teams who got a question wrong from Level 2 all receive a consolation prize and go down the Brain Drain. Level Three: Brain Trip (The Final Stage) For the bonus round, the contestant/team must successfully trace out three paths on grids within 90 seconds. The first path is 6 squares (5 squares on a season 1 episode) on a 4x4 grid, the second is 8 squares (10 squares on two season 1 episodes and 9 squares on a season 2 episode) on a 5x5 grid, and the third is 10 squares on a 6x6 grid; squares are always connected (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Each square has an actuator in the middle that must be stepped on to activate the square. Contestants see each path twice; the clock starts running when the contestant first activates a square. After completing a path successfully, the contestant must step on an actuator outside the board to stop the clock. Contestants are told immediately when they make a mistake, the grid turns red, makes a buzzer sound, and they must return to the start and view the pattern again before being allowed to continue; when viewing the pattern after a mistake, the clock continues to run. On Family BrainSurge, the child did the 4x4 and 6x6 while the adult did the 5x5, and the rest of the team (including the \\"Brain Trust\\") was allowed to help guide the contestant. Contestants/teams can win three prizes, one for completing each of the three paths, with the grand prize usually being a trip (though on a celebrity episode of Family BrainSurge, it was a billiards table); any prizes they win on one stage are theirs to keep, regardless of the final outcome. If time runs out, the contestant/team must go down the Brain Drain but still keep their prizes they won, while contestants/teams who succeed before time runs out are slimed, in network tradition. Also, on Family BrainSurge, before the level starts, the episode's winning team also got a donation made by the show's staff in their name to one of Nickelodeon's \\"Big Help\\" partner organizations. Specials Girls vs. Boys During the first week of the second season, the audience was divided into two sections, each with a group of a different gender. In each episode, male contestants wore green and female contestants wore purple. If a male contestant won, male audience members received a green BrainSurge T-shirt. If a female contestant won, female audience members received a purple BrainSurge T-shirt. Celebrity Episode Each season has at least 2 episodes featuring celebrity players, at least one of which had Nickelodeon stars as players. On the season 1 and 2 celebrity episodes, the Nick stars played and the winner played to win prizes and the sliming for a lucky audience member the losing nick stars will not get prizes for a audience for those who are Eliminated when Jeff introduced them he would say the show name. The season 2 Nick star episodes featured the stars representing their show in teams (either 3 teams of 2, or 2 teams of 3), even though each player wore a different color. Losing the bonus round meant that the celebrity had to go down the Brain Drain (in season 1, the audience member also went down the brain drain with the celebrity, while in season 2, it's just the celebrity while the audience member is standing with Jeff). On Family BrainSurge, the Nick stars won prizes for their Brain Trusts in the audience (fans of the show each team was representing). There were also two Family BrainSurge episodes with celebrities and their families playing to win prizes for themselves and a donation to a favorite charity the team eliminated in the first round receives $1,000 for their charity the two teams that are Eliminated in the second receives $1,500 for their charity in the WWE special the amount was changed $2,500 for their charity. The person who loses the knockout round get $3,000 for their charity in the WWE it was changed to $4,000 and winning team get $5,000 for their charity. There was also an episode with teams consisting of a child paired up with a WWE star the Kids receives prizes while the wrestlers Receive Cash To Donate for the Make a wish foundation unlike the other contestants the wrestlers wore whatever they wanted, rather than the BrainSurge shirts usually worn on the show by every contestant. Co-Host Week One week during season 2 featured Jeff hosting with a celebrity co-host by his side. The round one puzzles and the round two story usually contained references to that episodes co-host (mainly about what they're famous for). Also, during those episodes, if the player lost the final round, the co-host would go down the Brain Drain with the player. Likewise, if the player won the final round, the co-host would get slimed with the player. During the 1st level, the co-host would join Jeff on the brain screen. During the 2nd level and the knockout round, the co-host would be in the audience rather than joining Jeff, and during level 3 the co-host would join Jeff. The co-hosts were: *Natalie Coughlin *Tony Hawk *Tom Kenny *Misty May-Treanor *Jordin Sparks Family Week During the last week of season 2, there were pairs of related players competing, but the game was still played with the usual rules. Related players wore the same color shirt. Two episodes had 3 pairs of siblings playing individually, while another 2 episodes had the same configuration, but with 3 pairs of twins. On the sibling and twins episodes, the winners' sibling or twin would wish them luck via video before starting the bonus round. One episode that week had 6 parent-child teams playing which is similar to the family brainsurge and during the bonus round, the child did the 4x4 and the 6x6, while the parent did the 5x5. However, unlike the family brainsurge, there are no brain trust and no option for them to ask them for an answer in round 2.

It was based on a novel of the same name by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. The story combines real life character (Gilbert and Phillips) and the true ship Charlotte with its one time role as a convict transport, with fictional persons as convicts. Its understanding of the route and particularly of the mutiny act is, however, very flawed. Plot In 1787 a group of prisoners are shipped in Newgate Jail receive notice that their death sentences are commuted to life imprisonment in New South Wales. They are boarded onto the and joined by a smaller group of female prisoners. Gilbert, the captain, offers the pretty female prisoner free run of the ship on certain conditions. One prisoner Tallant admits guilt but is expecting a pardon to arrive within hours. The captain declines and Tallant jumps overboard. When caught he is sentenced to 50 lashes with a cat-o-nine- tails. Recovering below deck he offers ¬£1000 to any person helping. As Tallant has medical training he is offered a position a ship's surgeon, which also gives him free run of the ship. Gilbert is cruel to prisoners and crew alike. A young boy in a small cell dies of hypothermia when the cell floods with cold water. He is buried at sea. His mother tries to stab the captain and he shoots her. Tallant and the second mate excape in a row boat but are found. They are sentenced to be keel hauled. The captain is upset that they are living so orders a second haul. Spencer dies on the second haul. Tallant survives. Rev. Thynne threatens to inform Governor Philip of the barbary when they arrive at Botany Bay. The ship sails via South America (this would have been very unusual, the Africa route was the norm). There first port of call is Rio de Janeiro. However, they later discuss being off the coast of Africa. The journey has taken 237 days. Governor Phillip refuses to hang Tallant lant and sentenced him to hard labour in the penal colony in Botany Bay, New South Wales. However Gilbert demands that Tallant is charged with mutiny.Despite the fact that the Mutiny Act 1703 only has provisions only to punish members of the Royal Navy (which Tallant clearly is not, even were the Charlotte a Royal Navy ship) Governor Phillip raises no objection to this. Tallant escapes with a small group of men, and tracks down Gilbert at Stillwater Cove. He demands the Charlotte. But they in turn are surrounded by British troops and recaptured. As a further twist the group are surrounded by aborigines. Gilbert is hit by a spear and killed before the British fire power pushes them back. As the prisoners now have muskets they take charge again. Rather than escape he returns to Botany Bay.

The film rights were sold in July 1940 for a reported $50,000 and was intended to be a vehicle for Joel McCrea. In 1941 Joel McCrea expressed interest in playing the lead. The film was originally planned to be made in 1946, starring Ray Milland with location shooting in Australia. However these plans were delayed when Paramount became concerned about the cost. The project was re-activated in 1951 as a vehicle for Alan Ladd. Four koalas and two kangaroos were flown from Australia to appear in the film. The koalas were the first to be exported from Australia in 25 years and were later transferred to San Diego Zoo. The only Australian-born members of the cast were Murray Matheson and Brendan Toomey.

It appears to be the home of the face, which is promptly destroyed by the triangles, who flee the collapsing fortress. The song fades as the triangles sink into the sea.

Most of the land was owned by the New Zealand Defence Force owned for 124 years until 2009. Today it is the site of a controversial planned residential development which, as of July 2020, is the subject of three ongoing court cases and a pending city council vote.  Geography  Shelly Bay is on the west of the Mirimar Peninsular, north of its isthmus, and is about 8 km by road from Wellington's city centre. The land at the bay is part of the Wellington suburb of Maupuia and includes some reclaimed land, with nearby hillsides excavated to provide fill. According to the head of Victoria University of Wellington's Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences department, the land at Shelly Bay is at risk from coastal flooding due to sea level rises. In 2019, he predicted within forty years, damage previously seen once every 100 years would occur once every three or four years. He considered that a sea wall was feasible but that protecting the road around the coast would be problematic. According to Land Information New Zealand, the name \\"Shelly Bay\\" is not official; LINZ does not provide the origin of the name. History  MƒÅori history and European land purchase  In the 1820s and 1830s, a collection of peoples from multiple MƒÅori iwi (tribes), including Te ƒÄti Awa, Taranaki, NgƒÅti Ruanui, and NgƒÅti Tama, migrated to the region. This group became known as Taranaki WhƒÅnui ki te Upoko o te Ika. The village sited at the northern end of the bay was named Maru-Kai-Kuru.Te Ara o Nga Tupuna Heritage Trail Retrieved: 19 February 2009 In 1839 the bay was bought by the New Zealand Company along with most of Wellington.The Taranaki Report, Kaupapa Tuatahi, Chapter 5, Waitangi Tribunal, 1996, page 23. The deed of purchase would later be described as \\"seriously\\" flawed. It was in English only and had no map to define boundaries.  Defence use and ownership  Submarine and Torpedo Mining Corps annual camp, Shelly Bay, Wellington, taken about 1899 In 1885, the bay became a site for an anti-submarine mining base, due to fears of a Russian attack. The Submarine Mining Depot Barracks were constructed in 1887. The base was the site of an explosion in 1891 which killed one person. An inquest was held and its jury found there was not sufficient direct evidence for them to say what caused the explosion. In 1907 the land was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy. In 1942, reclamation of land began and the area became a naval station called HMNZS Cook. In 1946 ownership was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and renamed Shelly Bay Air Force Base, to accommodate a catering unit and up to 300 staff. The airforce base closed in 1995 and the New Zealand Defence Force put the land up for disposal. A naval museum was on the site but this was shut in 2008.  Treaty of Waitangi settlement  In 2003, the Waitangi Tribunal ruled that iwi were owed compensation over Shelly Bay. On 14 February 2009 4.5 hectares of land was handed over to the iwi Taranaki WhƒÅnui ki te Upoko o te Ika (also shortened to Taranaki WhƒÅnui) who bought the land as part of a $25 million Treaty of Waitangi settlement. The settlement related to wrongdoings in and arising from the 1839 land purchase. The Crown apologised over this sale, saying the deed was flawed and promises were never kept. The Crown failed to set aside one-tenth of the land for MƒÅori as required by the terms, took land for public purposes without compensation, and locked up remaining MƒÅori land in perpetual leases. The settlement included the right to buy the Shelly Bay property (as well as several other around Wellington) and the iwi chose to do so at a cost of at least $13.3 million.  Current use  Buildings previously part of the defence bases have had little or no maintenance since the base ceased operations. The wharf itself has almost rotted away. A number of artists rent studio spaces in the area. The area also features the Chocolate Fish cafe; former mayor Kerry Prendergast described the cafe as \\"iconic\\" and it became renowned after actors and crew from the Lord of the Rings trilogy frequented it. Some of the 2005 film King Kong was filmed in Shelly Bay, including construction of the giant wall that separates Kong from the rest of Skull Island. Shelly Bay is a short drive from the Mirimar studios used for filming the movie.  Development of the area  Map showing part of Shelly Bay and its ownership as of April 2017 Multiple uses for the land of Shelly Bay have been proposed since the closure of the defence base, including a casino, an indoor rainforest biome, and a movie museum, the latter being proposed by director Peter Jackson. Development of the area has been controversial; news site Stuff reported that it wrote about 400 articles on Shelly Bay between 2011 and 2019. Ian Cassels, director of the property development company The Wellington Company, has been planning a $500 million development for the land since 2014 but the project has faced legal, bureaucratic, and other barriers.  Resource consent  A resource consent was first granted by Wellington City Council in 2017 but it was legally challenged by the lobby group Enterprise Mirimar. A 2018 Court of Appeal decision quashed that resource consent, saying that the Council wrongly interpreted law when it decided to grant it. Following the court decision, there was a reconsideration of the consent process, conducted by independent commissioners, which was completed in October 2019. These commissioners approved a new resource consent. This consent allows for more intensive housing than Wellington's district plan would ordinarily allow. Enterprise Mirimar continues to oppose the resource consent.  Sale of iwi-owned land  To develop the area, Cassels has purchased land from the Taranaki WhƒÅnui iwi. Much of the land, officially owned by an entity called Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust (PNBST), was sold in June 2017 for $2 million, less than the iwi had paid for it. Sale of all the land had initially been voted on, and members of the Taranaki WhƒÅnui iwi voted against the sale, but the sale of a portion of the land was a smaller matter and did not require a vote. Mau Whenua, a group of Taranaki WhƒÅnui members, said the sale neither had the will nor mandate of iwi members and pledged to get the land back. PNBST said in a newsletter that it had to make the deal to survive as it was cash- strapped. A deal to sell the remaining land for $10 million was made by PNBST, also in 2019. Mau Whenua members obtained a caveat on a sale in July 2019, which prevents a sale unless it is withdrawn, removed by the High Court, or expires. However, PNBST had already made the deal to sell the land prior to the caveat, and Cassels stated he was confident he could get the High Court to remove the caveat. Opponents of the sale say there was no discussion of the sale before the deal was made. The caveat lapsed in December 2019 and the currently listed owner of this parcel of land is a company owned by Cassels and his partner. In December 2019 PNBST announced by a newsletter to Taranaki WhƒÅnui members that it was aiming to get back into the Shelly Bay development. The newsletter stated that PNBST is in talks with Cassels' company to buy land at Shelly Bay from the company. The land that PNBST is looking to buy is currently owned by Wellington City Council so would require the Council to go ahead with plans to sell to Cassels before Cassels could sell it to PNBST.  Proposed sale of Council-owned land  The proposed development would also require Wellington City Council to sell and lease some land to the developers. Councillors had voted in favour of the sales and leases in September 2017 and granted Council chief executive the power to do so, but after the issues with the resource consent and disputes over whether councillors had all the correct information, the chief executive Kieth Lavery refused to make the transaction and indicated in 2019 that the matter would likely go to a new vote. The Shelly Bay sale became an election issue in the October 2019 Wellington local elections, and most candidates had a position on the development. Prior to the election most councillors supported the development, but after the election, most of the current councillors oppose it. The mayoral election at the same time also saw Wellington mayor Justin Lester, who supported the proposal, replaced by Andy Foster, who as a councillor opposed it for several years.  Other objections  Director Peter Jackson opposes the development The development has seen opposition from other parties. Director Peter Jackson opposes the development, describing it as a \\"precious green space\\" threatened by \\"Soviet-era apartments\\". He has threatened legal action over the issue. The lobby group Enterprise Mirimar cite concerns such as traffic safety and congestion in their opposition. Mayor Andy Foster has said that the council needs to investigate road capacity and safety associated with the project. Wellington City Council has previously voted to cap its share of infrastructure for the development at $10m.  Possible central Government support  In 2020 the central Government announced a $3 billion infrastructure fund to restart New Zealand's economy following the coronavirus pandemic. Ian Cassels has applied to the fund, saying the Shelly Bay project is \\"shovel-ready\\", while lawyers for Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson have implored Government ministers to reject the application.

It is famous for containing the lines \\"Lupus est homo homini, non homo, quom qualis sit non novit,\\" which has been translated as \\"A man is a wolf rather than a man to another man, when he hasn't yet found out what he's like.\\" and \\"Facias ipse quod faciamus nobis suades,\\" which has been translated as \\"Practice yourself what you preach.\\" as well as \\"necesse est facere sumptum qui quaerit lucrum\\" which has been translated as \\"You must spend money to make money.\\"  Synopsis  The play takes place in Athens, near the homes of the old man Demaenetus and the procuress Cleareta. Demaenetus is submissive to his wife Artemona, but wishes to help his son Argyrippus gain money to free his lover, Cleareta's hetaera Philenium. Demaenetus conspires with his slaves Libanus and Leonida to cheat his wealthy wife of the money. The trick succeeds, but Diabolus, Philenium's jealous lover, acts to have it revealed to Artemona, who confronts her son and husband at a banquet held by Cleareta. Analysis Asinaria belongs to the genre called fabula palliata, of Greek plays adapted for a Roman audience. This has caused a debate over Plautus' originality and creativity arguing contamination, while others point out that neither is redundant, or conflictual with Plautus' dramatic intentions.Konstan, D. (1978). Plot and Theme in Plautus' Asinaria. The Classical Journal, 73(3), pp.215-221. Characters The initial reversal of roles comes from Demenetus and his wife Artemona, as he is the dependent on her dowry and she implicitly plays the strict paterfamilias. Classically, the paterfamilias is the obstacle in his dependent son's relationship, while Plautus makes Artemona the obstacle in front of Demenetus' desire for Philenium. Moreover, by introducing Demenetus in the role of a rival, Plautus disturbs the classical paradigm of the love triangle present in Miles Gloriosus (play) and Pseudolus. Plautus takes great care to enrich his characters beyond their obvious roles. In this play, Demenetus is ostensibly cast as a senex, but he denies both the audience and his slave Libanus in their expectations to get angry over his son's affair with a prostitute. The play takes an unexpected turn with his stipulation to spend one night with Philenium. Thus Demenetus goes beyond both the strict father and the avuncular role of senex and becomes involved in a love triangle. Themes The role of parents in their children's lives is represented through various perspectives in the play. With Artemona as the obstacle, Demaenetus as the dependent is cast in a traditionally adolescent role. His relation with Argyrippus is then set against Cleareta's with her daughter, both having lost the respect traditionally due to this position, one by a lack of funds and the second by her occupation. They are comparable in their appeal of filial piety to indulge their vices of lust and greed, respectively. The result is a materialistic abuse of conventional rules. The power of money is apparent in the now familiar theme of moral corruption as Demaenetus is further infantilized by his lack of moral strength. Moreover, Argyrippus and Philenium are humiliated and made to beg and offer favours to Leonida and Libanus for the twenty minae. The theme of materialism pervades the play, turning Asinaria into a defense of the ethical structure of the ancient patriarchal family than against money and passion.

After disappointing performance during flight testing the Sigma was passed on to a Canadian group which carried out modifications, making the Sigma more competitive. Design and development Designed to compete in the 1970 World Championships, the team aimed to develop a wing that would climb well through a high lift coefficient and a large wing area, but equally had the \\"maximum possible reduction of area for cruise at low lift coefficients\\". At the same time for the minimum possible drag they aimed for \\"extensive\\" laminar flow. To achieve this they employed flaps that would alter both wing area and wing camber. Based on analysis of the nature of thermals encountered in cross-country flying, they reasoned that by having a slow turning circle, their sailplane could stay close to the central (and strongest) part of the thermal and gain maximum benefit. Its unusual feature is its ability to vary its wing area using Fowler flaps. It had been tried before by the Hannover Akaflieg in 1938 with their AFH-4, the South African Beatty-Johl BJ-2 Assegai and the SZD Zefir gliders.The SZD Zefir series gliders of the 1960s also had Fowler flapped wings. Zefirs had been piloted to 2. and 3. (Cologne 1960), 1. and 2. (Junin 1962) places at World Championships, with L/D of Zefir-3 (1965) exceeding 43. Also LET L-13 Blan√≠k used Fowler flaps, however the latter was not intended to be a high performance glider. (Development of \\"Zefir\\" gliders; Lecture by Jerzy ≈ömielkiewicz (co-designer). Polish Aviation Technology, Historical Notes, issue 26, Sep 2006) Operation Sigma Ltd. was formed, attracting sponsorship from Hawker Siddeley and assistance from eminent aerodynamicists, and construction of a prototype was started at the Slingsby Kirbymoorside factory. A fire at the Slingsby factory in 1968 destroyed the prototype, which was nearing completion. Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd. soon went into receivership after the disastrous fire so the remaining prototype Sigma Type C was relocated to the British European Airways workshops at London Heathrow Airport (LHR). After completion it eventually flew for the first time on 12 September 1971 at the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield. The wings and tail boom are of aluminum alloy construction and the front of the fuselage is glass-fibre composite, with a welded steel tube centre-section connecting the fuselage components and wings. Other equipment fitted include a retractable main wheel, speed limiting air brakes and a tail parachute housed in a compartment in the rudder. The hydraulically actuated flaps increased the wing area to 177 square feet (an increase of 35%), lowering the wing loading and stalling speed (37 knots), allowing the desired tight circling when thermalling.\\"Sigma up for disposal\\" Flight International 1977 The hydraulic pressure needed to move the flaps was provided by the pilot pumping on the rudder pedals, this proving to be tiring, not to mention that moving the flaps in flight was found to be almost impossible due to bending in the wings. Performance testing revealed a disappointingThe SZD Zefir series gliders of the previous decade overcame the control problems with Fowler flaps (abandoning hydraulic and designing minimalistic low friction mechanical controls), but the Zefir designers ultimately concluded that the Fowler flaps are incompatible with the laminar flow required (over 70% of the chord) on the wing of a high performance glider (Jerzy ≈ömielkiewicz, op.cit.) best L/D of 41:1 and the project was wound up in 1977. The group offered the Sigma up to further development by other parties, selecting a proposal by David Marsden a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Alberta (on sabbatical at Cranfield Institute of Technology and a glider pilot holding records with his own glider designs such as the Marsden Gemini).\\"Sigma finds a home\\" Flight International, 5 November 1977 p.1353 The aircraft was moved to Canada in 1979 by Marsden, modified with a new flap system, conventional ailerons in lieu of outboard flap sections and the tail parachute was removed from the rudder. Despite the glide ratio only increasing to 47:1, its good climb rate made it competitive with contemporary Open Class gliders of the time, breaking the US 300 km triangle record in 1997 at .

It is an important stimulus to sales, with the goal of triggering in-store, on-shelf product recognition. The term packshot also refers to product placement in a movie or television show. Packshots often dominate television commercials, taking from two to five seconds of a thirty-second commercial. Forged or leaked packshots for unreleased products have led to controversy or increased interest in the product. Packshots can be a simple photograph of the product on a white background or can entail the use of elaborate props. Products sold as digital downloads, such as software, sometimes have digitally generated packshots when no physical product or packaging exists. There are a few goals that good packshot must have. First of all, the photographed product should be centered in the picture and almost fit the canvas. All letters and captions on the product must be legible. The company logo and brand should be exposed centrally. Lighting should be set very precisely, because it should provide a 3-dimensional perspective of the photographed object. Colours should be rendered in its natural tones. Making packshots combines elements of aesthetics, art and technique. Consumers see ready images that are perfect, but they should keep in mind that the end effect is achieved through techniques and preparations. Packshots can be produced manually by photographers or by machines. In the first case a professional photographer is needed, because only a professional can set lighting, focus, camera parameters, etc. Post-processing is often required. Unprocessed photographs from a camera can rarely be added directly to a website or web store. In most cases the photographer must correct the image, change colours, make amendments, remove the background, and add shades. A photographic studio is required to make these photographs, because working conditions must be very good. Example of a 3D packshot image In the end, ready photographs can be presented to the end user. There are a few possibilities. The user may browse a gallery containing static images of the product, shown from different angles. A second possibility is 360-degree view. In this case the user can spin the product around X and Y axes. A higher possibilities would be a 3D view, where the user can see the product and spin it in three dimensions. The whole process is a bit complicated and time-consuming, but thanks to this, the user can see the product as it really is. A packshot can offer great impressions to potential buyers. In e-commerce business it is a very important aspect of product presentation. If the product is well- presented to the end user with all the details (deep colours, real shape, perspective view) and features, then the numbers of returns and complaints will decrease. Good packshots can be profitable to e-commerce and business owners, and are useful to customers.

History According to the Mrs. Fisher's website, it was Eugene Fisher, Ethel (Feldt) Fisher's husband, who had the idea of producing potato chips. Eugene and Ethel cooked chips to earn extra money during The Depression. The logo for Mrs. Fisher's potato chips, invented by Eugene in the first year of business, has changed little over the years. The logo features a 'potato-man' wearing a top hat dancing in a circle with two children. Packaging for Mrs. Fisher's also features bright red and yellow striping along the edges. Originally, the brand carried the name \\"Mr. and Mrs. Fisher's\\"; but when Eugene Fisher later deserted his wife and daughter and the business, Ethel Fisher removed his name from the branding. The company, which still operates out of Rockford, was eventually sold by Ethel Fisher to truck driver Sylvester Hahn in 1949. Employee Anthony Marsili, and his brother Mario, purchased the business in 1962. Later, and for 29 years, the company was owned by Chuck, Pete and Paul DiVenti. The company is currently owned by Roma and Mark Hailman, former employees who bought the company in 2007. Since its inception Mrs. Fisher's has remained a locally run company.

It is normally consumed at lunchtime or as a snack. If another spread is added, particularly peanut butter, it becomes a variation of the PB&J; sandwich.  Origin  Jam sandwiches are thought to have originated at around the 19th century in the United Kingdom. In Scotland, they are also known as pieces and jam, or jeely pieces. The jam sandwich was an affordable food which was a major part of the diets of the lower/working-class people of cities such as London and Glasgow. One plausible reason for this was that the ingredients that the jam sandwiches were made from cost little to manufacture and due to taxes being lifted on sugar in 1880, it became widely available as a cheap foodstuff. Traditionally, jam sandwiches are just jam and bread, but with the invention of the toaster oven a variety of open jam sandwich became popular now known as jam and toast. Today, jam sandwiches are mainly consumed by children and the elderly; one can say \\"[a jam sandwich] is one of the greatest simplest pleasures of life\\". Shops do not often sell individual jam sandwiches.  Ingredients  *Any type of jam *Bread or brown bread (i.e., white or wholemeal)  In popular culture  The popular Scottish folk song The Jeely Piece Song, which appeared in the 1960s, humorously describes the effect of new social housing policies on the eating habits of Scottish youngsters. The lyrics were written by Adam McNaughton, and it was sung to the tune of Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight?). It was performed by Matt McGinn and many others. The musical group Jethro Tull referenced a jam sandwich in their 1971 song \\"Up the 'Pool.\\" 'The 'Pool' is short for Blackpool, Lancashire, in the north of England, and singer Ian Anderson adopts a Lancashire inflection and colloquialisms: \\"I'm going up the 'Pool/ from down the smoke [referring to London and the more industrialized south of England] below/ to taste me mum's jam sarnies/ and see our Auntie Flo.\\" In Charles Schulz's Peanuts comic, Linus is fond of what he calls \\"jelly-bread sandwiches\\".https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/2013/06/27?comments=visible#comments See also * List of sandwiches * Peanut butter and jelly sandwich  References  Category:Sandwiches ","title":"Jam sandwich (food)"},{"id":"21606777","text":"Karl Altmann (1802 in Feuchtwangen ‚Äì 11 January 1861 in Munich) was a German painter.

Most great thinkers put their talents to good use; not Brian. His creative mind is hard wired to manipulate and hoodwink the dim-witted and good natured. He lives and feeds off his most basic urges: Greed. He's a roguish charlatan who appears completely oblivious to the consequences of his actions and seems totally unaware of any ethical or moral values. Like a twisted puppet master he has everybody is dancing to his tune, whether they like it or not.Marlow, M.

Like a piece of putty he can be moulded into thinking and doing virtually anything. The perfect stooge for Brian's little scheme's. He's like a lost little boy trapped in his childhood. Unfortunately for him, his guiding light is leading him down a terrible path.Marlow, M. (2008); The Brian Jackson Show Press Pack; limited release. * Tony Donald (George Young (actor)) - Tony is a multifaceted, complicated guy who simply can't shake off his childhood baggage (viz., Brian). He's the nucleus of the show. It's his house, Robin and Brian temp for his recruitment agency, Crystal is his girlfriend and with that he's a man of many contradictions. On the one hand he's the clean cut business man with responsibilities and bottom lines to think about; on the other, he's the petty, insecure, selfish, insensitive boyfriend. A man trapped in a transition between adolescence and adulthood.Ibid. * Crystal Kiltgaard (Gemma Harvey) - Crystal is the antithesis of Brian and acts as the moral centre or the voice of reason in the show. Slim, attractive, wholesome and good natured, she's everything the other three are not. Brian is her main tormentor, although Tony comes a close second, and though she tries her best to resist, it isn't long before the other three bring out the darker sides of her character. Quick with the tongue, she soon snaps back at them and does her utmost to keep order. Despite the overwhelming forces riding against her, she gives as good as she takes.Ibid.

It was also indicated that specific antibodies penetrate into the nuclei of fibrobasts and inhibit the activity of topoisomerase I. Moreover, the studies evidenced that topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, down-regulates the expression of type I collagen in fibroblasts of scleroderma patients and yields immunosuppressive effects. Certain cytokines were shown to increase the activity of topoisomerase I in dermal.Rudnicka, L; Makiela, B; Majewski, S, Czuwara, J; Nowicka, U; Barusi≈Ñska, A (1996). \\"Regulation of topoisomerase I expression and activity in dermal fibroblasts\\". Journal of investigative dermatology Volume: 106, Issue: 4, April, 1996, pp. 930 The hypothesis by Rudnicka was discussed during medical conferences, but was never confirmed by other researchers. However, the findings related to the role of campothecin and its potential therapeutical use were reaffirmed in the study by Zhang et al. conducted in patients with keloid.Zhang, Guo-You; Gao, Wei-Yang; Li, Xuan; Yi, Cheng-Gang ; Zheng, Yan; Li, Yang; Xiao, Bo; Ma, Xian-Jie; Yan, Li; Lu, Kai-Hua; Han, Yan; Guo, Shu-Zhong.

Peripheral blond mononuclear cells from patients with systemic sclerosis show abnormally high expression of prolactin. Hair diseases and Trichoscopy A second field of research of Rudnicka is related to hair and scalp disorders. She made a major contribution to development of hair and scalp dermoscopy (trichoscopy) and was the first to coin the term trichoscopy. Her and her co-workers‚Äô studies on genetic hair disorders showed that it is possible to diagnose genetic hair shaft abnormalities in children without the need of pulling hairs for microscopic evaluation. In 2005, Rudnicka and Malgorzata Olszewska used videodermatoscopy in assessing disease severity and monitoring impact of dutasteride therapy on hair thickness and hair shaft heterogeneity in androgenic alopecia, indicating this method can be used as a research tool to evaluate the effects of therapeutic or cosmetic agents Olszewska M., Rudnicka L.: Effective treatment of female androgenic alopecia with dutasteride. J Drugs Dermatol 2005, 4, 637‚Äì640 The next year, together with Malgorzata Olszewska and their co-workers she introduced the term trichoscopy for hair, scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes dermoscopy (videodermoscopy).Rudnicka L, Olszewska, M, Majsterek, M, Czuwara, M, Slowinska M: Presence and future of dermoscopy. Exp Review Dermatol, 2006, 1, 769‚Äì772 Their subsequent studies showed this technique can easily replace traditional microscopic evaluation in genetic hair shaft abnormalities such as Netherton syndrome, monilethrix, wooly hair syndrome, pili torti, pili annulati and trichothiodystrophy.Rakowska, A; Slowinska, M; Czuwara, J; Olszewska, M; Rudnicka, L (2007). \\"Dermoscopy as a tool for rapid diagnosis of monilethrix\\".

It has also been proved trichoscopy can be useful in diagnosing acquired hair diseases including androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata, cicatrical alopecia and tinea.Slowinska M, Rudnicka L, Schwartz RA, Kowalska-Oledzka E, Rakowska A, Sicinska J, Lukomska M, Olszewska M, Szymanska E.: Comma hairs: a dermatoscopic marker for tinea capitis: a rapid diagnostic method. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2008, 59(5 Suppl), 77‚Äì79 Rudnicka and her co-workers were the first to apply in vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy in hair diagnostics. Their studies showed potential usefulness of this method in evaluation of hair shaft diseases.Rudnicka, Lidia; Olszewska, Malgorzata; Rakowska, Adriana (2008). \\"In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy: usefulness for diagnosing hair diseases\\". Journal of Dermatological Case Reports 2. Lidia Rudnicka, together with Malgorzata Olszewska and Adriana Rakowska, has written the first Atlas of Trichoscopy, which was translated to multiple languages, including Chinese, Russian, Portuguese and Polishhttps://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781447144854 and is considered by some dermatologists the main trichoscopy textbook. Melanoma prevention Rudnicka is the organizer of a Polish nationwide campaign to promote prevention and early detection of melanoma (with dermoscopy and videodermoscopy). The campaign \\"Stop-Melanoma\\", based on highly successful Australian experience, is an ongoing program which started in 2004. Antibiotic therapy of inflammatory skin diseases Clinical observations made by Rudnicka and her co-workers indicate the rationality of long-term low- dose antibiotic therapy in chronic inflammatory skin diseases: SLE and psoriasis.Rudnicka, L; Szyma≈Ñska, E; Walecka, I; S≈Çowi≈Ñska, M (2000). \\"Long- term cefuroxime axetil in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

The Regals played an independent schedule under the supervision of the BC Amateur Hockey Association. The Regals were 3-time Allan Cup National Senior \\"AAA\\" Champions and 1-time Hardy Cup National Intermediate \\"A\\" Champions.http://dennis-kane.com/the-powell-river-barn/ Titles The Regals won the Senior \\"AAA\\" 1997 Allan Cup with a win over three-time defending champion Warroad Lakers in the final, the 2000 Allan Cup by beating the Lloydminster Border Kings in the championship game, and the 2006 Allan Cup with a 7-1 drubbing of the Whitby Dunlops. Powell River was also a finalist at the 1999 Allan Cup, losing to the Stony Plain Eagles 5‚Äì3. Earlier in their history, the Regals won the 1970 Hardy Cup championship as Intermediate \\"A\\" hockey champions of Canada with a three games to two, best-of-five series win over Val-d'Or, Quebec. The 1950s Regals‚Äô history goes as far back as hockey's beginnings in Powell River. Just after the Willingdon Civic Arena was completed in 1955, a three-team local league comprised Home Gas, Rodmay's and Wilshire's Variety Store. George Whyte and Vic Lupul, who later played for the Regals, were members of these teams as were the three Hildebrand brothers. A traveling team called the Powell River Luckies was then formed. Coached by Johnny Gorman, the Luckies played in a league with Coquitlam, Nanaimo and New Westminster. When the Rodmay Hotel, under the management of Al Mantoani, acquired the sponsorship of the team in 1957 a ‚Äúname the team‚Äù contest was held with Powell River Rodmay Regals as the winning entry. Regal spelled backwards being ‚Äúlager,‚Äù a type of beer. This began an association that was to last for more than a decade. Under multiple sponsorship since 1972, the team is now known as the Powell River Regals. Several of the Luckies players joined the Regals including, Gene Strueby, George Whyte, Dave Kineshanko, Jim Raisbeck, Wally Anderson, Don Alsop and Wally Hretchka. Many of these men contributed to hockey in Powell River through their coaching and involvement with minor hockey and added a great deal to the development and training of young hockey players in this community. Under the direction of their first three coaches, ‚ÄîJim Raisbeck, Mike Shabaga and Bob Bergeron, ‚Äîthe team was unable to get past the Nanaimo Clippers. The Clippers, who were Hardy Cup finalists during one of those seasons, turned out to be arch-rivals for the Regals for many years to come. The 1960s In the 1961‚Äì62 season, guided by coach Andy McCallum, the Regals finally advanced up the play-off ladder into the Coy Cup finals for the first time. They lost that series to the powerhouse Twin City Macs from the Okanagan. Regals made their second and third consecutive trips to the Coy Cup finals in the following two seasons but came up short in both series, falling on each occasion to the Kamloops Chiefs. Beset by insurmountable problems and without a league to play in, the Regals hung up their gear for the 1964‚Äì65 season. The following year the Regals again reached the Coy Cup finals, emblematic of intermediate hockey supremacy in British Columbia. Playing in Quesnel against the Kangaroos, the Regals lost a bitterly fought series that had the Powell River fans glued to their radios. It was the first year of operation for CHQB 1280 AM and what a following they had. Walking down any street in town the game could be heard as radios were turned way up. Many people, who had been with the club for years, including Hap Parker, say that the series was the making of the Regal Club. Down to nine players due to injuries, the team fought for two and a half periods of overtime before bowing out to the Kangaroos. The Regals became Coy Cup champions for the first of four times in 1966-67 as they beat the jinx and disposed of the Prince George Mohawks in two straight games. Their next opponents, the Lloydminster Borderkings, were a team that was to become very familiar to the Regals. Although the Borderkings prevented any further playoff action for the Green and Gold that season, they didn't remove the satisfaction of being provincial champions. Quesnel recaptured the Coy Cup the following season, stopping the Regals‚Äô drive for a second-straight provincial title. In 1968‚Äì69, a serious incident in a game against the Shmyr Flyers forced Andy McCallum to retire and Bob Crawford took up the coaching reins. Crawford led the Regals to their second Coy Cup title but the Lloydminster Borderkings once again put an end to further playoff hopes. 1969-70 The Regals finished the longest and most grueling season ever in mid-April 1970 as Canadian Hardy Cup Champions of Canada. The year did not start well with players being scarce and the team seeming unable to jell. The addition of Dave Parenteau was a great help and after Christmas things started to happen. The Regals finished second in the regular season standings and faced, and then defeated, Comox in the first round of the playoffs. Port Alberni Labatts were the next opponents and as usual were no pushovers but the Regals did eventually prevail. The Chemanius Blues did not put up much of a fight as the Regals swept the series in high scoring, one-sided affairs. Regals and Shmyr Flyers split the first two games of their series forcing a third and deciding game. The evenly matched teams were tied at the end of regulation play and the Regals advanced with two goals in the 10-minute overtime period. The Prince George Mohawks were unable to score in the next series as the Regals rode strong goaltending performances to win in two straight. Kimberley was all that stood in the way of a third Coy Cup title and after the series victory, the Regals hosted Lloydminster in the next round. The third time was the charm against the Borderkings and with the win hockey fever gripped all of Powell River. Rosetown Red Wings came to town full of rumours about the Regals and their toughness. They left with the same impression at the end of the hard-hitting series won by the home team. Unbelievably the next step was the Canadian finals. With the luck of the draw all games were to be played in the westernmost point. Val D‚Äôour, Quebec, came to Powell River for a best-of-five series to determine the Hardy Cup champions of Canada. The teams split the first four games forcing a fifth and deciding game. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre number one‚Äù reverberated through the Civic Arena rafters as the final seconds of Game 5 wound down in the 5-3 contest much to the jubilation of the fans and relief of the players who had gone through 26 playoff games to reach the pinnacle of Canadian Champions. The 1970s Several members of the team retired in the years following the Hardy Cup championship leaving the club to undertake a rebuilding program. Regals defeated Port Alberni in the 1970-71 league final but the following year Labatts ended a 10-year domination of the league by the Regals. In 1972-73 many of the old-time players suited up for a game to boost the injured players fund. They included Rudy Pantuso, Andy McCallum, Barry Lang, George Whyte, Doug Lessor, Gene Strueby, Al Small, Wally Anderson, Bob Keil, Desi Lever, Orris Sage, Ev Henderson and Mel Waldron. Russell Sage joined the Regals becoming the first son to follow in his father's footsteps. The team moved to the new Powell River Recreation Complex for the 1975‚Äì76 season and dominated the Pacific Coast Amateur Hockey League. Even with Len Pepper, the league's top scorer, the team was unable to put together a lengthy playoff run. The Regals joined the North West Hockey League in 1976-77 and played in the North Island Intermediate Hockey league the following season before rejoining the PCAHL for the final two years of the decade. These years were full of promise and high expectations but a single Coy Cup semi-final appearance was all the team had to show for it. The 1980s After ceasing operations in 1980‚Äì81, the Regals once again played in the PCAHL in 1981-82 but struggled, winning just two games all year. Legendary defenceman John Vanderkemp made his impressive debut during that season and was a regular winner or contender for the club's best defenceman award for the next 25 seasons. Randy Casparie, also a rookie, went on to become one of only four players to score over 200 career goals in a Regal uniform. Mike Andrews, also a member of the 200 goal club, was in his second season with the club and, along with Vanderkemp and Casparie, would form the core of a team in the 1980s that, with the additions of players like Pierre Roy, Gary Pierce, Verne Kinley, Tod English, Darren Clark and Brian Inkster, would climb up the rankings and quickly become one of the top teams in both the league and the province. Regals fortunes turned quickly in the 1982‚Äì83 season, as they became one of the top teams in the league and earned a trip to the league finals. The Chilliwack Royals would deny the Regals of the league title that season and in each of the three seasons that followed. The 1985 series was the only time the Regals pushed the Royals to a seventh and deciding game. Trailing three games to two and playing game six at home, Brian Inkster scored the winner on a penalty shot late in regulation to send the series back to Chilliwack. Game seven was perhaps the most dramatic and remembered contest involving the Regals in the 80s. With goaltender Irv Stoddart pulled, Regals defenseman Tod Semenuk notched his fourth goal of the game and sent it to overtime. The teams battled into two periods of overtime before the Royals prevailed. In 1986‚Äì87, the Regals finally made it back to the Coy Cup final for the first time since the Canadian championship season of 1969‚Äì70. Facing the Kangaroos in Quesnel, a 7-3 third period lead in the deciding game was not enough as the Kangaroos stormed back to win the game, the series, and their sixth straight Coy Cup. The same two teams faced off for the title the following season, this time in Powell River. The home crowd wasn't enough and the powerful Kangaroos took the series in two straight games. Quesnel's seven-year hold on the Coy Cup ended in 1988-89 but it was the Abbotsford Blues who claimed the trophy by defeating the Regals in Powell River, handing the local team its third-straight finals defeat. The 1990s The BC Amateur Hockey Association adopted a four-team tournament format for the 1989‚Äì90 season to determine the Coy Cup champion. After downing Quesnel during the round-robin portion of the tournament, the Regals suffered a heartbreaking loss at the hands of the Kangaroos in overtime of the semi-final game. 1990-91 marked the first occasion in which the Regals played for the AAA Savage Cup provincial title. Not having a league to play in was the main reason for the step up. The most talented team in many years breezed through the round-robin, received a bye to the final, and were able to rest and watch the host Whitehorse Canadians fall to Abbotsford in the semi- final. Full of confidence, the Regals got into early penalty trouble in the championship game, fell behind, and were never able to recover. Regals joined the Royal City Hockey league in 1991-92 and would again play for the Coy Cup. With just 16 players on the score sheet, the green and gold fought their way to a 4-3 semi-final victory over Sicamous and set up a final match-up with the host Penticton Silver Bullets. Despite a heroic goaltending performance by Tyler Findlater, two timely second period goals by Verne Kinley and a third period marker by Russ Simmons, Penticton put an end to the Regals Cup quest for another year with an empty-net goal late in the third. The 23-year drought would finally end in 1992‚Äì93. The acquisition of high-scoring defenseman Jim Smith was a big boost to the team's offense. After taking both the league and playoff titles in the RCHL, the Regals hosted the Coy Cup tournament and received the bye to the final after round-robin wins over Sicamous and Fort St. John, and a tie with the New Westminster Beavers. The Beavers would make their way to the final as well and face the Regals for the ninth time that season. The game would end the same way as the first seven matches, a Regal victory. Many members of the championship team had been around for the many disappointing outcomes during the previous years and it was a great relief to them to finally be able to sip from the coveted Coy Cup. The team once again moved up to the AAA level in 1993-94 and dominated the RCHL losing just two games all year and was considered the favorite to win the four-team Savage Cup tournament held in Prince George. As it turned out they were the first team ousted after losses to the host club and similar outcomes against Quesnel and the eventual champions from Penticton. Important additions that year were Scott Mastrodonato and Trevor Forsythe who combined with Vanderkemp and Smith to form a solid core on defence for many years. The RCHL became the West Coast Senior Hockey League in 1994-95 but the new name was the only change. The Regals once again finished atop the standings just ahead of vastly improving New Westminster. In April 1995 the Regals hosted the Savage Cup tournament and earned the bye to the final with wins over Prince George, Bellingham and Quesnel. The Kangaroos fought their way to the final and the two old foes put on a thrilling show with the Regals coming out with a 5-4 double overtime victory on a goal by Jim Smith. The following weekend the Regals travelled to Stony Plain, Alberta, to play for a national championship for the first time in 25 years. After losing the first game to the defending champions from Warroad, Minnesota, Regals defeated Truro, Nova Scotia 6-1 before being eliminated from further action by the host team after a 5‚Äì3 loss. Shortly after the end of the season, the club submitted a successful bid to host the 1997 Allan Cup tournament. Regals defended their Savage Cup title in 1995‚Äì96 with a three games to one series win over the Prince George Lumber Kings. The Kings earned a split of the first two games in Powell River making the win even more impressive as the remainder of the series would be played in the northern BC city. After taking Game 3, Regals trailed by two goals after 40 minutes of game four until Mark Bogoslowski scored twice in the third to complete his hat-trick and lead his team to victory. Next on the agenda was Stony Plain in the BC/Alberta finals. All games in the best-of-five series were to be held in the town just outside Edmonton. The home team would only need three of them to secure the win and move on to the Allan Cup, edging the Regals by scores of 7‚Äì5, 5-3 and 4‚Äì2. After two years of planning and preparation, the Allan Cup tournament took place in Powell River from April 8 to 12, 1997. Regional champions from Stony Plain (West), Truro, Nova Scotia (East) and Warroad, Minnesota (Central) joined the host Regals to battle for the Canadian Senior AAA title. Regals downed Truro and Warroad, then skated to a 3‚Äì3 tie with Stony Plain to finish atop the round-robin and secure a berth in the final. Third-place finisher and three-time defending Allan Cup champion Warroad upset second place Truro in the semi-final and joined the Regals in the championship game. Trailing 2‚Äì1, Regals scored two late second period goals and never looked back. Bob Moon scored the eventual winner early in the third followed by Rick McLaren's insurance marker, the second of the game for the team's rookie of the year. Warroad answered once more but tournament MVP Scott Mastrodonato's goal into an empty net sealed a 7‚Äì3 victory for the home team in front of a packed recreation complex arena. The 1997‚Äì98 season once again resulted in Stony Plain representing Alberta and the Regals doing the same for British Columbia. The best-of-five series was played in Powell River with the Regals winning games 1, 2 and 4 backed by strong goaltending from Chad Vizzutti. The team would travel right across the country to Nova Scotia to attempt to defend their title. Competition was stiff and the Regals finished the round-robin in fourth and would advance no further after losses to Truro and London, Ontario, and a win over Ile des Chenes, Manitoba. Stony Plain hosted the 1999 Allan Cup tournament and finished first after edging the Regals by a goal in the final game of the round-robin. Regals got past Lloydminster in the semi-final and advanced to the final where they played their fifth game in five days. The well-rested host team took advantage of the weary Regals with three early goals and eventually built a 5‚Äì0 lead. Rick McLaren finally got the Regals on the board in the second with a short-handed goal, building momentum for his team. Regals would get as close as 5-3 and dominated the third period but time ran out and the home team hoisted the Allan Cup. 2000 and beyond The 1999‚Äì2000 season started off on a positive note as the Regals hosted a Russian Elite Division team in a pair of exhibition games. The teams skated to a 6‚Äì6 tie in the first game, which included a thrilling last minute goal by the home team to even things up. The visitors managed a 5‚Äì3 win the following day but despite the loss, fans and players were equally delighted to witness, and take part in, the high-level hockey action. In the playoffs, Stony Plain and the Regals met in the BC/Alberta final for the third time. Bill MacGillvrey and former Stanley Cup winner Ken Preistlay were key additions for the green and gold's playoff run. The Eagles were able to pick up one win in the best-of-five held in Powell River but series MVP Chad Vizzutti was nearly unbeatable in games one, three and four enabling the home team to take the series in four games. Next up was the Allan Cup tournament in Lloydminster. Regals skated to an impressive 10‚Äì2 win over Regina in the first game then fell to Saint Georges, Quebec and the host club from Lloydminster in their next two outings. With Regina losing their final two games, Regals secured third place in the round-robin and a spot in the semi-final against Saint Georges. Strong goaltending, an excellent game plan from coach Kent Lewis, and timely scoring allowed the Regals to defeat the talented team from Quebec and move on to the final. With a sold-out crowd behind them and confidence from a round-robin win over the Regals under their belt, Lloydminster came out strong in the first period. Regals all-time leading scorer Tod English quieted the crowd with a first period goal and Chad Vizzutti weathered the storm turning away each shot he faced. Lloydminster tied the game in the second but third period goals by tournament MVP Trent Kaese and right-winger Mike Hassman gave the Regals a two-goal cushion. An empty net goal and a 37-save performance by Vizzutti resulted in the Regals claiming the Allan Cup for the second time in four seasons. In 2000‚Äì2001, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association rewarded the Regals for their Allan Cup victory by sending the team to represent Canada at the Nagano Cup tournament in Japan. A 3‚Äì2 win over Japan for Canada/Regals was the highlight of the trip for most involved. With both Chad Vizzutti and Scott Peters hurt, Canada/Regals went with Jamie Ram in goal in the final game and after a couple unfortunate bounces, Poland was able to eke out a 6‚Äì5 win to claim the Nagano Cup. What was a trip of a lifetime seemed to take its toll on the Regals come playoff time. The fourth BC/Alberta final between the Regals and Stony Plain had something in common with the first three series. The home team was again victorious. The Eagles prevented the Regals from defending their title with a three-game series sweep. Regals hosted the Allan Cup for the second time in April 2002. Familiar foes won their way to Powell River as Stony Plain, Saint Georges and Warroad were the regional representatives. The six game round- robin ended with Warroad winless and eliminated. The three remaining teams all had 2-1 records with Stony Plain getting the bye to the final because of goal differential. The semi-final was an emotional roller coaster ride for the players and fans as each team took turns holding the lead only to see their opponent fight back and tie the score. The crowd erupted in the final minute when Jim Smith's shot from the point found its way into the net to send the game into overtime. Minutes later, Saint Georges quieted the crowd with the overtime winner on a breakaway. The Quebec champions went on to defeat Stony Plain in the final and become the first visiting team to celebrate a national title on Powell River ice. In 2002-2003 the club decided to ice both a AA team to play for the Coy Cup provincial title and a AAA squad to continue the quest for another Savage and Allan Cup. The AA team's season ended in heartbreak. After advancing to the Coy Cup final game in Trail, the team fell 2‚Äì1 in overtime. A bright spot was local 23yr old Jeffrey Parsons fresh off his gold medal win in Sweden at Deaf world Championships racked up an amazing 12 points in 4games to take Coy Cup MVP award in a dominant performance despite the tough loss. The AAA squad hosted the Savage Cup best-of-five final against Dawson Creek Canucks. The series was a sweep but the scores were far from lopsided. The home team took the first game 6-3 followed by a 6‚Äì5 win in game two. The third and final game went into overtime, where Kent Lewis set up Mike Hassman for the winner, sending the Regals on to the BC/Alberta final. The team was full of confidence heading into Stony Plain but managed only one goal in a three-game sweep at the hands of the Eagles. The Regals traveled to Dawson Creek for the 2003-2004 Savage Cup tournament and fell in marathon semi-final match against the host club in the fourth-overtime period. The loss ended the Regals reign as AAA champions of British Columbia, which had begun in 1995. The rebuilt 2004-2005 squad breezed through the Savage Cup tournament in Trail with a convincing win over the East Kootenay Royals and two equally impressive victories over the host club. Awaiting the Regals in the next round, not the perennial Alberta Champion Stony Plain Eagles, but Theoren Fleury, Gino Odjick, and the Horse Lake Thunder. The visiting Regals fought gallantly but were unable to win a game in the best-of-five series. The Powell River Regals Hockey Club hosted the Allan Cup for the third time in April 2006. The tournament has grown to include five regional champions along with the host club. The team started off the year with a pair of exhibition games at home versus the Victoria Salmon Kings of the East Coast Hockey League. The visitors won both games by scores of 7-3 and 6‚Äì2. Despite the losses, playing a professional team was a great experience for the Regal players as they prepared for the high level of competition at Allan Cup 2006. The Regals then went seven wins to four losses the rest of their schedule. Next up was a best of five series with the Trail Smoke Eaters for the provincial championship the Savage Cup. The teams split the first two games in Trail, before the Regals captured their 12th BC title on home ice outscoring their opponent 42‚Äì13 in the four game series. Next up was the Allan Cup. In their first game Powell River took on the Alberta Champion Fort Hotel Chiefs defeating them 4‚Äì2. The final round robin game was against the Quebec Champion Shawinigan Extreme. With Shawinigan defeating the Chiefs 8-2 and the tie breaker being a goals for and against formula, the Regals needed to win to earn the bye to the semi- final. It was a tight battle for 60 minutes with each team scoring just once. The format called for a five-minute sudden victory overtime period after which if there was no scoring it would remain a tie and the Quebec champs would earn the automatic berth into the semi-final. Wanting the win and the extra day off the Regals pulled their goaltender with just over a minute remaining. Keeping the play in the zone the Extreme iced the puck giving the Regals one last chance to score with 6.4 seconds remaining. The face-off ended up in the corner and it looked to be over. But Jamie Leach dug the puck out and threw it into the high slot and onto the stick of Mike MacKay who's one timer found the back of the net for the winner with just 1.7 seconds left. The Regals won the game 2-1 and had the bye. The day off helped the hosts immensely. In their semi final they faced the Trail Smokeaters for the first time since the Savage cup. The Regals handed them another lopsided defeat, this time 7‚Äì1. The final had the green and gold taking on the two time Allan Cup Champion Whitby Dunlops. The result was the same as the semi final with the Regals cruising to a 7‚Äì1 victory and their 3rd Allan Cup in nine years. The following season Hockey Canada once again rewarded the Regals for their Allan Cup victory by sending them to the IIHF sanctioned Polese Cup in Gomel, Belarus. Along with Canada the tournament included the Russian Super League's Salavat Yulaev and the National Teams from Latvia and Belarus. Although Canada lost all its games, they kept every game close until running out of gas in each of the 3rd periods. Not bad considering they were playing against full-time professional players. Goaltender Chad Vizzutti shone once again internationally earning goaltender of the tournament honors. A month after representing their country the Regals hosted the Savage Cup. Also vying for the title were the Trail Smokeaters and the upstart Fort St John Flyers. The one game final had the Regals taking on the Flyers. Without their full line up due to injuries and other commitments, the Regals lost the game and a chance to repeat as Savage Cup champions. The 2007‚Äì08 season had the Savage Cup hosted by the Flyers in Fort St John. It was a best of 5 between the Regals and Flyers. Once again due to other commitments and injuries the Regals were only able to bring 14 skaters. But outstanding goaltending from Chad Vizzutti and timely scoring the Regals took the first two games and were half a period away from taking back the Savage trophy. But with a lack of bodies and fatigue setting in the Regals couldn't sustain and ended up losing game three. The Flyers had swung the momentum and took the final two games to retain the provincial crown and their second ever Savage Cup. The Regals began a rebuilding mode at the start of the 2008-09 campaign by returning full-time to the AA circuit and not icing a AAA squad for the first time since 1992/93. The club had operated separate AAA and AA clubs in 2002/2003. After qualifying for the Coy Cup in Terrace, BC, Regals went undefeated during the round-robin portion of the tournament and advanced directly to the final. A young Regals team almost pulled off an upset, but ultimately fell to the Williams Lake Stampeders 5‚Äì4 in overtime. Although the end result left a bitter taste in the mouths of the young players, veteran Scott Mastrodonato said, ‚ÄúIt was a good lesson, whether it was a life lesson or a hockey lesson, you learn from your mistakes. ‚ÄúIt was heartbreaking to lose the way we did,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut in some small way it was a good thing because since we didn‚Äôt win, we still have something to shoot for.‚Äù Experienced coaches and players are wary of the pitfalls when things come too easy and Mastrodonato warned ‚Äúthat if they had won in their first year then everyone would have thought we‚Äôre good enough and the truth is, we‚Äôre not.‚Äù On a sad note, one of the founding members of the Powell River Minor Hockey Association and a driving force in the creation of the Regals, Powell River's own Mr. Hockey, Hap Parker, died in September 2008, at the age of 94.

He works in painting, drawing, sculpture, and printmaking, and lives and works in New York City. Condo's The Cloudmaker (1984) Condo's La Femme du jour (1987) Condo's The Cracked Cardinal (2001)  Early life  Condo was born in Concord, New Hampshire. He studied art history and music theory at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Throughout his early life he studied guitar and music composition while pursuing his lifelong interest in painting and drawing. After two years at UMass Lowell he moved to Boston where he worked in a silk screen shop and joined proto-synth/punk band The Girls as a bassist,Hilarie M. Sheets (October 29, 2019), A Sun God? A Cyborg? No, It‚Äôs a George Condo Creation New York Times. with abstract painter Mark Dagley, avant-garde musician Daved Hild, and Robin Amos, founding member of Cul de Sac. Their only single, \\"Jeffrey I Hear You\\"/\\"Elephant Man\\" (1979) was produced by David Thomas of Pere Ubu. Condo met Jean-Michel Basquiat for the first time in 1979, when Basquiat's band Gray opened for the Girls at the downtown nightclub Tier 3. After this meeting Condo moved to Ludlow Street in New York City to pursue his career as an artist. He became a founding member of the punk/blues band Hi Sheriffs of Blue in 1980.  Work  When he emerged in the East Village art scene in the early 1980s, Condo coined the term Artificial Realism, \\"the realistic representation of that which is artificial\\", to describe his hybridization of traditional European Old Master painting with a sensibility informed by American pop. Along with Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, Condo was instrumental in the international revival of painting from the 1980s onward. Condo's work has been influential to many artists of his generation and the generation that followed him, including Nigel Cooke, Sean Landers, John Currin, Lisa Yuskavage, and Glenn Brown. The first public exhibitions of his work took place in New York City at various East Village galleries from 1981 to 1983. During this period he worked in Andy Warhol's factory, primarily in the silkscreen production studio applying diamond dust to Warhol's Myths series. He moved briefly to Los Angeles and had his first solo exhibition there in 1983 at Ulrike Kantor Gallery. After returning to New York later that year he made his first trip to Europe. Condo moved to Cologne, Germany, where he met and worked with several artists from the Mulheimer Freiheit group, including Walter Dahn and Jiri Georg Dokoupil. His first solo exhibition in Europe was in 1984 at Monika Spr√ºth Gallery. While still in Europe Condo met and began working with American art dealer Barbara Gladstone, and in 1984 he had a simultaneous two-gallery exhibition in New York at Pat Hearn and Barbara Gladstone Galleries. Already close friends with Basquiat by this time, Condo met Keith Haring on returning to New York, and the two remained lifelong friends until Haring's death from AIDS in 1990.Keith Haring Journals, Introduction Robert Farris Thompson, Penguin (Non- Classics), 1997 Several of Condo's most significant works from this period, such as Dancing to Miles (1985), which was included in the 1987 Whitney Biennial and is now in the collection of the Broad Foundation in Los Angeles, were painted in Haring's East Village studio. Between 1985 and 1995 Condo lived and worked mostly in hotels and rented studios between Paris and New York, while continuing to exhibit extensively in the United States and Europe. In Paris, Haring introduced Condo to the American writer and artist Brion Gysin, who in turn later introduced him to William S. Burroughs. Condo and Burroughs collaborated on numerous paintings and sculptures between 1988 and 1996. Selected works from their collaborations were exhibited in 1997 at Pat Hearn Gallery, New York. Condo and Burroughs also worked together on a collection of writings and etchings titled Ghost of Chance, which was published by the Whitney Museum in 1991. While in Paris, Condo also met and befriended philosopher and semiotician F√©lix Guattari, best known for his collaborations with Gilles Deleuze, when Condo was working in a studio in the apartment building where Guattari resided. Guattari wrote extensively on Condo's work, including an introductory text and interview in the exhibition catalogue for Condo's 1990 solo exhibition at Galerie Daniel Templon. Of Condo's paintings Guattari wrote: \\"There is then a very specific 'Condo effect' which separates you from all the painters you seem to reinterpret. You sacrifice everything to this effect, particularly pictorial structure, which you systematically destroy, thus removing a protective guardrail, a frame of reference which might reassure the viewer, who is denied access to a stable set of meanings.\\" (Felix Guattari, 1990) Throughout his career as an artist, Condo's work has served as an influence and inspiration to contemporary writers including Burroughs, Guattari, Demosthenes Davvetas, Donald Kuspit, Wilfried Dickhoff, and Salman Rushdie, whose 2001 novel Fury includes a chapter inspired by Condo's 1994 oil painting The Psychoanalytic Puppeteer Losing His Mind.Fury (novel) American fiction writer David Means also used a Condo painting, The Fallen Butler (2010), as inspiration for his short story \\"The Butler's Lament\\", which appears in the catalogue for the exhibition Mental States, a mid-career survey of the artist's paintings and sculptures organized by the Hayward Gallery, London, and the New Museum, New York, in 2011. Allen Ginsberg, a close friend and frequent visitor to Condo's Paris studio, where he photographed the artist on several occasions, asked Condo to paint his portrait for the cover of his Selected Poems: 1947-1995, published in 1996 by HarperCollins.http://www.allenginsberg.org/index.php?page=poetry- books Condo's paintings, like The Orgy (2004), Superman (2005), Batman and Bunny (2005), Maja Desnuda (2005), Dreams and Nightmares of the Queen (2006), and God (2007), place archetypal human figures in a world of humorous, grotesque painting style that the artist refers to as Psychological Cubism. Commissions In addition to commissions for book covers, such as Jack Kerouac's Book of Sketches (Penguin Poets, 2006),Book of Sketches for which he also wrote the introduction, Condo has also created or designed album covers for numerous musicians.The Story of the Ghost Most notably, in 2010 Condo collaborated with rapper Kanye West and created a series of paintings for West's album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and various singles. Kanye West used to use a Condo painting as his Twitter image, and Condo has painted a Herm√®s Birkin Bag for West that West gave to Kim Kardashian. Kanye Gives Kim Kardashian a George Condo-Painted Herm√®s Birkin Bag Condo also produced four alternate copies of the album cover that, although not included on the actual cover of the record, came included with certain productions of the record on vinyl and as individual posters. All variations reflect themes found throughout the West album, and were all considered for the cover. The final design, depicting a demonic caricature of the artist with a female phoenix on his lap and bottle in his hand, was even censored by iTunes, and the album cover is now a blurred version of the Condo painting.http://www.vulture.com/2010/11/kanye_george_condo.html That same year, Condo released a t-shirt with Adam Kimmel for Barneys New York. Adam Kimmel x George Condo T-Shirt for Barneys New York Condo's work has also been featured on the covers of the Phish album The Story of the Ghost (Elektra, 1998), Danny Elfman's Serenada Schizophrana (2006), and Franck Debussy Schumann by Dora Schwarzberg and Martha Argerich (AventiClassic, 2006), among others. Most recently, Condo painted an abstracted portrait of the opera countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo for the cover of his first album ARC, released in 2018 by DeccaGold and featuring recordings of works by Philip Glass and George Frideric Handel. In 2020, Condo collaborated with rapper Travis Scott and created the artwork for Scott's single \\"Franchise\\".  Exhibitions  Condo has exhibited extensively in the United States, Europe, and Asia. His works have been included in exhibitions at many prestigious museums including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery, Buffalo; Fonds national d'art contemporain, Ministere de la Culture, Paris; Museu d'Art Contemporani, Barcelona; the Kunsthalle Bielefeld in Germany; the Mus√©e Maillol, Paris; the \\"Terrae Motus\\" collection in the Royal Palace of Caserta, Italy; the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo de Monterrey, Mexico; the Mus√©e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain, Nice, France; the Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden- Baden, Germany; the Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastricht, Netherlands; the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin; the Nationalgalerie's Berggruen Museum, Berlin; and the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C. In 2005 the Museum der Moderne Salzburg and Kunsthalle Bielefeld co-organized the exhibition George Condo: One Hundred Women, curated by Dr. Thomas Kellein. The exhibition was accompanied by a monograph featuring essays by Margrit Brehm, Stacey Schmidt, and Kellein. In 2009 the Musee Maillol, Paris, organized the exhibition George Condo: The Lost Civilization featuring paintings, drawings, and sculpture created between 2003 and 2008. The monograph published by Gallimard in conjunction with the exhibition featured new writings on the artist's work by Didier Ottinger, Bertrand Lorquin, and Massimiliano Gioni, as well as a reprinting of Felix Guattari's original text from 1990. In 2011, the New Museum in New York City opened a mid-career retrospective of Condo's work titled Mental States. This watershed exhibition was critically acclaimed by Holland Cotter of The New York Times as \\"sensational\\". The show traveled to Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, the Hayward Gallery, and the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt. In 2013, Condo's large black-and-white banner featuring a court jester was installed on the fa√ßade of the Metropolitan Opera House, advertising the Met's new production of Verdi's Rigoletto.Carol Vogel (January 25, 2013), \\"George Condo, On View In and Outside the Metropolitan Opera House\\", The New York Times. In 2016 the Berggruen Museum in Berlin honored Condo with the exhibition George Condo. Confrontation. In 2017, the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., presented George Condo: The Way I Think, 1962 - 2017. The exhibition is a major survey of Condo's drawings and \\"drawing paintings\\" that will travel to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humleb√¶k, Denmark, in the fall of 2017.

Recognition In 2000, Condo was the subject of the documentary film Condo Painting, directed by John McNaughton. The film, which follows the progress of Condo's large-scale oil painting Big Red over the course of one year, features an appearance by Allen Ginsberg, as well as footage of Condo collaborating with William S. Burroughs on paintings the two made together at Burroughs' Kansas home in the mid-1990s. There has been extensive critical writing about Condo's work. Several monographs have been published, including The Imaginary Portraits of George Condo (powerHouse), George Condo: Sculpture by Thomas Kellein (Hatje Kanz), George Condo: One Hundred Women (Hatje Kanz), and in conjunction with an exhibition of the same title, George Condo: Mental States (Hayward Publishing). In 1999, Condo received an Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and in 2005 he received the Francis J. Greenburger Award. He has been invited to lecture at many prestigious institutions including Columbia University, Yale University, Pasadena Art Center, San Francisco MOMA, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, and the New Museum, New York. In 2004, Condo taught a six- month course at Harvard University entitled Painting Memory.

A vocal school, blab school or ABC school or old-time school was a type of children's primary school at some remote rural places in North America, outdated and obsolete as the 19th century progressed. The school children recited (blabbed) their lessons out loud separately or in chorus with others as a method of learning.  Etymology and word origin  Blab is the shortened form of the word \\"blabber,\\" meaning to talk much without making sense. Middle English had the noun , \\"one who does not control their tongue.\\" A blab school was where the school children repeated back their teacher's oral lesson at the top of their voices. The school children vocalized out their lesson in \\"Chinese fashion\\" as harmonized voices in unison. In more elegant terms, instead of saying they were blab schools they were referred to as vocal schools. The neighbors of such a children's school of the 19th century would hear all the noise coming from the school of the children reciting the teacher's lesson aloud, and then dubbed the schools \\"blab\\" schools since it sounded like \\"blab-blab-blab.\\"  Description  A blab school was popular in frontier days of the American West, since many settlers could not read. These one-room schools were called \\"old field\\" schools and were log cabins, many times with just dirt floors. The students sat on wooden backless benches. This type of school was referred to as an \\"Old-time School\\" in the Appalachian region of Virginia in the 19th century. A blab school was basically without books and paper for the students. The schooling consisted of a teacher, with perhaps one or two books, speaking a short oral lesson and the schoolchildren reciting it back with a loud voice several times until memorized. The only requirement needed to become a teacher was to know how to read. Reciting the information learned was a form of entertainment in frontier days as well as a means of learning. In those days paper was scarce so memorizing was the preferred method over writing things down. The subjects of reading, writing, and arithmetic were the basic ABC items in the 19th century typically learned by the young children reciting out loud the lesson. In blab schools it was typical for a teacher to comment about a child grasping the lesson. This student was referred to as a \\"leather-head\\" and was awarded with praise from the teacher. In many of the \\"ABC schools\\" of the United States each pupil was to recite first thing in the morning of the new school day the lesson they learned of their homework assignment of the previous day. The ambitious ones reached the school house by sunrise since they recited in the order of their arrival in the morning. The school rule was \\"first come, first called\\" and after a student's recital the teacher called out \\"Next\\" as they knew the order of each student's arrival. The method of reciting one's lesson to memorize it was referred to as \\"loud studying.\\" Many people of the time believed that listening to one \\"blabbing\\" out loud their lesson benefitted the education of the other students. Teachers were not shy in dishing out punishment to those who didn't loudly shout out their lesson. The teacher would walk around the classroom with a wooden switch or paddle when the students were reciting and use it on the child if the student was not loud enough to the teacher's pleasing.  Abraham Lincoln  Abraham Lincoln's 1822 vocal school U.S. president Abraham Lincoln learned his ABCs when he attended a vocal school which he walked to in his youth. The school he first attended was at least a mile from his home. His first two teachers were Zachariah Riney and Caleb Hazel, who taught from a windowless schoolhouse. Another teacher of Lincoln was Azel Waters Dorsey (1784-1858) who taught him for 6 months in 1824 in a blab school in Spencer County, Indiana. Lincoln learned first from spelling books. It was customary to learn first to spell all the words of the spelling books and recite several times before advancing to read other books. Lincoln studied Dillworth's Speller and Webster's Old Blueback. Later then he advanced to reading Murray's \\"English Reader.\\" Lincoln was noted for shouting out his reading lesson on the path from his home to the blab school and could be heard for a considerable distance. He had the habit of reading anything aloud. Between the ages of 11 and 15, Lincoln went to school occasionally between his obligated home duties. All of Lincoln's schooling combined in various blab schools amounted to less than a year. Many times the blab school Lincoln attended didn't even have a teacher and the older, more advanced students, often teenagers, taught the younger children.

Max Bond Jr. (1935 - February 18, 2009) was an American architect. He developed an interest in architecture based on experiences ranging from viewing a staircase at a dormitory at the Tuskegee Institute to views of North African construction styles on a visit to Tunisia. He became one of a small number of nationally prominent African-American architects. He married writer Jean Carey Bond in 1961 and they had two children. Education Bond was educated at Harvard University, where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1955 and earned a master's degree three years later. During his time at Harvard, he was one of a group of eleven black students targeted by a cross- burning incident in front of their dormitory, Stoughton Hall. He ignored advice from a Harvard faculty member to give up the professional pursuit of architecture due to his race, overcoming barriers in what was at the time a white profession. Career He started his professional career in France with Andr√© Wogenscky. He moved back to New York City, working at the firms of Gruzen & Partners and at Pedersen & Tilney. He moved to Ghana where he designed several government buildings, including the Bolgatanga Regional Library in an area near the border with Burkina Faso, which consisted of four buildings shaded by a common roof that was designed to provide natural ventilation and make air conditioning unnecessary. He was in Ghana from 1964 until 1967. Back in the United States, he served as head of the Architects' Renewal Committee in Harlem (ARCH) in 1967 and 1968. In 1970, together with Donald P. Ryder, he founded the architectural firm of Bond Ryder & Associates which was responsible for the design of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute in Birmingham, Alabama, as well as Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The firm merged with Davis, Brody & Associates after Ryder's retirement in 1990.

He has expressed views in favour of the validity of some paranormal phenomena. In a recent paper in American Psychologist he wrote that \\"The evidence for psi is comparable to that for established phenomena in psychology and other disciplines, although there is no consensual understanding of them.\\"Carde√±a, E. (2018). The experimental evidence for parapsychological phenomena: A review. American Psychologist, 73(5), 663-677. In a series of interviews with Swedish Newspapers he has said that there is evidence for telepathy, psychokinesis and precognition and that he himself has had experiences that could be interpreted as supporting the psi hypothesis. The Parapsychological Association honored Cardena with the 2013 Charles Honorton Integrative Contributions Award. Cardena has written more than 300 publications. His edited book Varieties of Anomalous Experience: Examining the Scientific Evidence published in 2000 and a second edition in 2014 is a scholarly volume on anomalous experiences. His two volumes Altering Consciousness discusses the importance of altered states across history, culture, and in many disciplines including philosophy, anthropology, psychology, biology, and various others. In addition to his professional work in psychology Etzel Carde√±a is the Artistic Director of the International Theatre of Malm√∂ and has worked in theatre as a director, actor and playwright in Mexico, the USA and Sweden.

As part of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain, it is an institution of the Swiss federation. For most of the period since its foundation in 1880, it concentrated on classical materials testing. Since the late 1980s it has developed into a modern research and development institute. Research According to its vision ‚Äì Materials and technologies for a sustainable future ‚Äì Empa aims at developing solutions for current problems facing industry and society in areas such as energy, the environment, mobility, health and safety. Research is concentrated in five Research Focus Areas: \\"Nanostructured Materials,\\" \\"Sustainable Built Environment,\\" \\"Health and Performance,\\" \\"Natural Resources and Pollutants,\\" and \\"Energy\\". Empa's annual budget in 2015 amounted to 107 million Swiss francs of Federal funding and 61 million Swiss francs of third party means, of which 45 million Swiss francs came from research grants and 11 million Swiss francs from services. The strategy shift from a materials testing to a research institute has been increasingly apparent since 2001: the number of scientific publications increased from 67 in 2001 close to 630 in 2015. The number of projects financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) increased from 5 in 2001 to 120 in the same period. External funding has also grown from 33.8 million Swiss francs in 2000 to around 61 million Swiss francs (2015). Empa is currently involved in more than 60 projects funded under the EU framework programs. Applied research and development in the institute often unfold in close collaboration with partners from industry. This is also reflected by the Empa slogan: \\"Empa - The Place where Innovation starts\\". Empa embraces a multidisciplinary approach ‚Äì scientists and engineers from a wide range of disciplines work side by side on most projects. The Empa also provides support to both of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology in Zurich and Lausanne, supports teaching in universities and universities of applied sciences (UAS) and is active in organizing scientific conferences and advanced training courses through the Empa-Akademie. Conferences, lecture series, seminars and courses are aimed at scientists, professionals from industry and the private-sector, and also the general public, for example, through the \\"Science Aperitifs\\" events. Empa premises at D√ºbendorf near Zurich  History  Empa building at St. Gallen In 1880, Empa's forerunner, the \\"Institution for the Testing of Building Materials\\" begins its work at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich. Its first Director is Ludwig von Tetmajer, professor for building materials. In 1891 Tetmajer is charged with investigating the Munchenstein rail disaster, the collapse of a railway bridge, built by the world-famous engineer Gustave Eiffel. Tetmajer is quickly able to demonstrate that the use of Euler‚Äôs hyperbola, which up to that time had been the standard technique, is only applicable in the elastic region of the steel used for the bridge. In 1895, the name ‚Ä≥Federal Materials Testing Institute\\" is first used, the German acronym for which is Empa. In 1937, the Swiss Testing Institution, St. Gallen, having been expanded in 1911 to a textile testing authority, merges with EMPA. The expanded organization is renamed \\"Federal Materials Testing and Experimental Institute for Industry, Civil Engineering and Trade\\". In 1962, the Empa moves from Zurich to D√ºbendorf. The key areas at this site are civil engineering, safety technology, surface technology, metallic materials, composites, non-destructive testing, chemical analysis, exhaust gas and atmospheric measurements, building technologies, building physics, acoustics and noise abatement. In 1988, a significant change of course occurs, with a strong emphasis on research and development. The Empa is renamed \\"Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research\\" (Eidgen√∂ssische Materialpr√ºfungs- und Versuchsanstalt in German). In 1996, staff at Empa‚Äôs St.Gallen site move into their new building ‚ÄúIm Moos‚Äù. Core activities are clothing physiology, personal protective systems, functional fibers and textiles, biocompatible materials, materials and image modeling, and technology risk evaluation. In 2001, Empa‚Äôs priorities are oriented firmly towards research and innovative developments. An international Research Commission is established, evaluating Empa's R&D; activities on a regular basis. In 2003 nanotechnology is established at Empa. The new laboratory \\"nanotech@surfaces\\" works on nanostructures, nanotubes as electron emitters and quasi-crystalline layers. In D√ºbendorf another new lab, \\"Functional Polymers\\", is established. In 2004 yet another nano lab sees the light of day at the D√ºbendorf site: \\"Nanoscale Materials Science\\", focusing on developing and analyzing nanostructured surfaces and coatings. In 2005, together with the Warsaw University of Technology and the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krak√≥w, Empa founds the International PhD School Switzerland ‚Äì Poland. ETH Zurich, Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w and Warsaw University have since joined. Meanwhile, this cooperation with the EU's new member states (NMS) has expanded substantially within the framework of The Swiss contribution to EU enlargement, for instance via numerous \\"Joint Research Projects\\" as well as joint events such as the \\"Swiss-Polish Science & Technology Days\\", which were staged for the first time in Warsaw in 2010. Further laboratories are founded: \\"Mechanics of Materials and Nanostructures\\", \\"Mechanical Systems Engineering\\", \\"Mechanics for Modeling and Simulation\\", \\"Biomaterials\\", \\"Materials-Biology Interactions\\", \\"Hydrogen & Energy\\" and \\"Solid State Chemistry and Catalysis\\". In 2006 the \\"Center for Synergetic Structures\\", a public-private partnership (PPP) between Empa and Festo, is established with the goal to develop novel, ultra-lightweight load-bearing structures. In 2008, Empa opens a new business incubator, \\"glaTec\\", in D√ºbendorf to support the founding of innovative start-ups and spin-offs in close proximity to Empa. glaTec is the counterpart to \\"tebo\\" in St. Gallen, which has been in operation since 1996. Empa also intensifies its activities in photovoltaics. Moreover, a closer cooperation with Japan's \\"National Institute for Materials Science\\" (NIMS) is agreed upon, resulting in the 2010 opening of a NIMS office at Empa. In 2010, Empa expands its business development endeavors and develops new models of cooperating with industry, tailored specifically to the partner's needs. Among other things, strategic alliances are forged in vital areas such as fuel cells, innovative medtech applications and sustainable mobility. In the same year, the Empa is streamlining its R&D; portfolio into five \\"Research Focus Areas\\", which are geared even more stringently towards Empa's core competence: turning research and technologies into marketable innovations. With 25 projects in 2011 and 2012, Empa plays an extremely successful role in the special measures against the strong franc funded by the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), which are designed to boost the innovative strength and thus the competitive ability of Swiss companies. In 2014, the Swiss government initiates a focus program to encourage energy research: Eight different Swiss Competence Centers for Energy Research (SCCERs) are designed to connect Swiss universities and research institutions more effectively in the field of energy research and promote synergies. As leading house, Empa is in charge of one of these eight centers ‚Äì Future Energy-Efficient Buildings & Districts (FEEB&D;) ‚Äì with the aim of reducing the energy consumption of Switzerland‚Äôs building stock fivefold by the year 2050. 2014 marks the ground-breaking ceremony of NEST, an innovative building concept that should help launch technology and products in the building and energy sector on the market sooner in conjunction with industrial partners. NEST comprises a central ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù and three open platforms, where individual research and innovation modules can be installed based on a ‚Äúplug-and-play‚Äù principle. In 2015 NEST‚Äôs backbone is up. The construction of the first modules gets underway. The same year, Empa opens a second demonstration and technology transfer platform in the mobility sector: ‚Äúmove‚Äù, which enables new vehicle drive concepts with considerably lower CO2 emissions to be developed and tested in practice. These include hydrogen vehicles, various hybrid concepts or optimized gas vehicles. The energy source is currently electricity from photovoltaic plants or hydroelectric power stations that temporarily fluctuates heavily and is not needed on the power grid. It is initially converted into hydrogen or methane by electrolyzing water (power-to-gas concept). At the same time, a third platform commences operations: ehub (Energy Hub), which acts as a kind of nerve center to control and coordinate energy flows between NEST and ‚Äúmove‚Äù with their various energy users and sources. ehub should therefore guarantee an optimized energy supply, especially using heavily fluctuating energy sources such as solar and wind power. The platform therefore has diverse temporary storage facilities for the various energy sources.

Since only one Commissioner's Trophy is awarded to the team, a World Series ring is an individual award that players and staff of each World Series champion team get to keep for themselves to symbolize the victory. World Series rings are uniquely commissioned by the winning team each year and presented to deserving players and staff early in the next season. The rings have been made by companies that include Jostens, Tiffany & Co., Dieges & Clust, and L.G. Balfour Company.The first World Series ring was given to members of the New York Giants after winning the 1922 World Series. By the 1930s, each winning team gave their players a ring. Though the ring started off simple, usually containing only one diamond, rings over time have become more elaborate and ornate, with the 2003 World Series ring containing over 200 diamonds.In addition to their inherent value, World Series rings also carry additional value as sports memorabilia. A World Series ring belonging to Casey Stengel sold for $180,000. Lenny Dykstra's 1986 World Series ring sold for over $56,000 during his bankruptcy proceedings. Other rings sold in auctions have sold for over $10,000 apiece. Replica rings given to fans have sold for as much as $300. History Johnny Pesky displaying a commemorative ring given to him by the Boston Red Sox after the 2004 World Series Prior to the 1922 World Series, players on the World Series-winning team were given keepsakes, such as a pin or pocketwatch fob. The first World Series ring was given to the members of the New York Giants following their victory in the 1922 World Series over the New York Yankees. When the Yankees won the 1923 World Series, players were given a commemorative pocketwatch. The Yankees first gave rings to their players following the 1927 World Series. Rings became an annual tradition in the 1930s, as every World Series-winning team has given rings to its players since 1932. In past years, players often requested other items in place of rings, including cufflinks and tie clips. Frankie Crosetti and Tommy Henrich requested shotguns from the Yankees following World Series championships. Grover Cleveland Alexander reportedly pawned his 1926 World Series ring. Members of the 1973 World Series champion Oakland Athletics were upset when team owner Charlie O. Finley, following salary disputes with his players, presented his team with rings that were identical to the ones received after winning the 1972 World Series, except without the one-carat diamond. Reggie Jackson referred to them as \\"trash rings\\". The first ring to contain more than one diamond was the 1977 World Series ring commissioned by the Yankees, which had over a dozen diamonds. Over time, ring designs have become larger and more elaborate, with Yogi Berra saying in 2009, \\"They're so much bigger now, they're like weapons. You can't even wear them.\\" Whereas older rings were 10 carat and between 20 and 25 pennyweight, modern rings are typically 14 carat and 50 pennyweight. The rings commissioned by the Florida Marlins after the 2003 World Series are believed to be among the most expensive World Series rings ever made; made of 14-carat white gold, the ring featured 229 diamonds, including one teal diamond, and 13 rubies. The rings cost $20,000 apiece due to the quantity of the purchase, though they retailed at $40,000 each. After breaking their long championship drought in 2016, the Chicago Cubs commissioned rings said to be worth up to $70,000, consisting of 214 diamonds at 5.5 carats, 3 carats of rubies, and 2.5 carats of sapphires. Teams have also increasingly added distinctive touches to make their rings unique from previous versions. For their 2007 World Series rings, the Boston Red Sox commissioned a special version for players who were on both the 2004 and 2007 championship teams, and for 2013, they included the Boston Strong logo on the side. The St. Louis Cardinals had the Rally Squirrel engraved into their 2011 World Series championship rings. For their 2014 World Series rings, the San Francisco Giants included three diamonds on the top bezel and five on the bottom, representing their three titles in five years, and eight championships overall. The 2016 World Series rings for the Chicago Cubs each contain 108 diamonds around the bezel, one for each year that the team went without a championship, and also include an image of a goat on the inner band. Companies that have been commissioned to create World Series rings include Jostens, Tiffany & Co., Dieges & Clust, and the L.G. Balfour Company. Distribution Players typically receive their rings in pregame ceremonies early in the next season. Since the rings are commissioned by the team, many non-players affiliated with the team, including front office executives, coaches, scouts, broadcasters, locker room staff, and groundskeepers also receive rings at the team's discretion. After the 2004 World Series, the Red Sox ordered over 500 rings; the Cardinals commissioned 400 rings in 2006; and the Kansas City Royals distributed about 700 rings after their 2015 title. Players who were only briefly on the team's roster during a championship season and those no longer affiliated with the winning team also often receive rings. Arthur Rhodes, Bengie Molina, and Lonnie Smith played in the World Series against a team they played for earlier in the season, guaranteeing them World Series rings regardless of the series outcome. As both the physical size and number of rings given out has increased, teams have started producing both \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" versions, and sometimes \\"C\\" versions, that are similar in appearance but smaller in size and use cheaper materials. The most expensive \\"A\\" rings are typically reserved for full-time players, coaches, and executives, while bit players and other team employees receive the cheaper \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" rings. Rings as trophies In modern years, the importance of World Series rings to players has increased, whereas decades ago during the reserve clause era, players typically emphasized more the bonus World or League Championship check rather than the ring. Alex Rodriguez said his 2009 World Series ring \\"means the world\\" to him, and that he would wear it daily. Sergio Romo of the 2010 World Series champion San Francisco Giants said of his ring: \\"In all reality, this is why we play right here.\\" Jon Jay said his 2011 World Series ring \\"...represents last year and all the hard work. Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of something like this.\\" Former player and current Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper said, \\"It's not a hug. It's not a handshake. It's not a pat on the back. It's a ring. It's the one thing every professional athlete wants: something they can hold onto, something they can show off.\\" Players' names and uniform numbers are often individually inscribed in their ring. Many players prefer to display their rings as trophies as opposed to wearing them. Memorabilia World Series rings are considered valuable sports memorabilia. In 2007, Casey Stengel's 1951 World Series ring sold for $180,000. When Lenny Dykstra went through bankruptcy in 2009, his 1986 World Series ring sold for $56,762.50 through Heritage Auctions, three times as much as was expected. Others have sold their rings on eBay. Doug Baker of the 1984 World Series champion Detroit Tigers had a new ring made after his original was stolen, and when he recovered the original ring, he sold it for $12,322. Cucho Rodriguez, a scout for the Red Sox, sold his 2004 World Series ring for over $53,000 and in 2011, Scott Williamson auctioned off his 2004 ring for $89,000. More recently, Willie Stargell's 1979 World Series ring was sold at auction for over $82,000. However, the ring that once belonged to disgraced pitcher Brandon Puffer, when offered for sale on the August 15, 2013, episode of Pawn Stars could not be sold. The shop declined to make an offer, claiming Puffer's off-field problems destroyed the resale value of the ring. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum contains an exhibit on World Series rings. The New York Yankees Museum, located in Yankee Stadium, has an exhibit with replicas of all Yankees' World Series rings, including the pocket watch given after the 1923 World Series. Yogi Berra won the most World Series rings with 10, as a player. Frankie Crosetti won 17 as a player and as a coach. The most valuable rings can sell for a million dollars or more, most notably the rings belonging to the 1927 Yankees starting lineup. Babe Ruth's ring, after being in the possession of Charlie Sheen for 20 years, sold at auction for over 4 million dollars in 2017. Its whereabouts are currently unknown as the buyer is unknown.

It was proposed by Healing Through Remembering, a cross-community organisation devoted to dealing with the legacy of the conflict. The occasion sought to look toward a peaceful future, while reflecting on the violence of the past. The day has been held annually since 2007 on 21 June, the summer solstice; it was chosen for this date as the solstice was deemed an opportunity for looking both forward and back. The Day of Reflection was specifically mentioned by the report of the Consultative Group on the Past who recommended that it be renamed the Day of Reflection and Reconciliation. Background A Day of Reflection was one of the six recommendations contained in the report published by the Healing Through Remembering Project in 2002. The report recommended that an annual Day of Reflection be established which would ‚Äòinitially be a day for private individual reflection‚Äô, with the purpose of the day developing over the years ‚Äòmoving from personal and organisational reflection to becoming more collective, public and shared among communities, groups, churches and organisations'; it was described as an attempt to revive the well-established practices of commemoration, which tended to focus on death and loss, with a new sense of purpose and openness to the prospects for peace and regeneration. In 2004 a sub group of people of diverse backgrounds was established within the Healing Through Remembering initiative to explore ways of taking forward the original recommendation. Initially the sub group commissioned and conducted research to inform their work including research looking at days of reflection in an international context, research exploring potential dates on which a Day of Reflection might take place locally and a scoping study to assess local views on the idea and practical steps which could be taken to make a Day of Reflection a reality. In May 2006 the sub group met to consider the results of the research and the scoping study and to form a strategy for its ongoing work. As part of the Sub Group strategy it was agreed to initiate the holding of a ‚Äòprivate Day of Reflection‚Äô on 21 June 2007, as a first stage to stimulating debate and continuing exploration of the viability of the original HTR recommendation. In light of the response to the Day of Private Reflection 2007, the Sub Group organised a further Day of Private Reflection on 21 June 2008. Other organisations have since gone on to mark the day annually in their own way.

History Official National Children's Wind Orchestra of Great Britain logo NCWO was originally formed to provide a very high level opportunity for Young performers to play at a level which will not compromise on difficulty of music for the age of the performers. The boys and girls in the group used to rehearse as The National Children's Wind Orchestra for just one residential course a year held in the East School Holidays. This was led by their conductor Phillip Scott who developed the band and drove the standard and popularity of the course up. He still holds the position of Conductor at the present day, but he now conducts the National Youth Wind Ensemble. Ever since the band was formed, it has been a small group with few players to each part organisation, making it totally unique among British youth bands which played on a national scale.

She was the sister of King John III of Navarre and the wife of the widely notorious Cesare Borgia, whom she married in 1499. She was the mother of his only legitimate child, Louise Borgia, to whom she acted as regent following the death of Cesare.  Family  Charlotte was born in 1480, the daughter of Alain I of Albret, Lord of Albret, and Frances, Countess of P√©rigord. Her paternal grandparents were Jean d'Albret and Charlotte de Rohan, and her maternal grandparents were William, Viscount of Limoges and Isabelle de La Tour d'Auvergne, daughter of Bertrand V de La Tour, Count of Auvergne and Boulogne, and Jacquette du Peschin. Her paternal great-great-grandfather was Charles d'Albret, Constable of France, who was killed while commanding the French troops at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. She had six siblings including John d'Albret, who became King of Navarre upon his marriage to Catherine of Navarre.  Marriage to Cesare Borgia  On arrival to the throne, Louis XII of France intended to establish strong bonds with Brittany in order to incorporate it to the Kingdom of France, aiming to marry Anne of Brittany for the purpose; however, he was married by then to Joan of Valois. The Foix-Albret, led by Alain de Albret, feared a French takeover of B√©arn, de facto sovereign, but claimed now by the French king. The Navarrese monarchs Catherine and John started a rapprochement to Louis XII in order to appease his ambitions in B√©arn, by supporting Louis XII in his attempt to marry the Breton princess. Louis XII demanded the annulment of her marriage to the Pope. The latter responded in kind by requiring a princess of royal blood to marry his son Cesare. The monarchs of Navarre proposed in turn Charlotte for the bargain. The political move would get the monarchs Catherine and John peace of mind to the north of the Pyrenees, while at the same time establishing friendly diplomatic relations with Rome that could pave the way to solve their conflict over ecclesiastic appointments in Navarre, especially concerning the bishop of Pamplona Pallaviccini, a designation contested by the Navarrese monarchs. The conditions were set down on the contract of the wedding held in spring of 1499. On 10 May 1499, at the age of 19 at Blois, Charlotte married Cesare Borgia, the notorious illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI Borgia and Vannozza dei Cattanei. He had recently been created Duke of Valentinois by King Louis XII of France. The marriage was political, arranged with the purpose of strengthening Cesare's alliance with France. Cesare did not remain for long in the territories under the rule of the Foix- Albret, since Cesare departed to Italy soon after wedding and getting Charlotte pregnant, neither coming back to know the newborn daughter. Cesare accompanied King Louis in his invasion of Italy. Charlotte was described as having been \\"beautiful and rich\\". In 1504, she became the owner of the properties of Feusines, N√©ret, and La Motte-Feuilly. Cesare and Charlotte together had one daughter * Louise Borgia, suo jure Dame de Ch√¢lus, suo jure Duchess of Valentinois (17 May 1500 ‚Äì 1553), she first married on 7 April 1517 Louis II de la Tr√©moille, Governor of Burgundy; she married secondly on 3 February 1530, Philippe de Bourbon, Siegneur de Busset, by whom she had issue. Cesare had at least eleven illegitimate children by various mistresses. After escaping from a Spanish prison, Cesare died at the siege of Viana on 12 March 1507 in the service of Charlotte's brother, the king of Navarre with whom he had sought refuge. Following his death, Charlotte acted as regent for their only daughter, Louise, who had succeeded her father as Duchess of Valentinois. Almost seven years after Cesare's death, on 11 March 1514, at the Chateau of La Motte-Feuilly, Charlotte died. She was buried in a tomb at the church at La Motte-Feuilly. As of the 21st century, there are many living descendants of Cesare Borgia and Charlotte of Albret, including Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma.

Seventeen of the old locks on the canal were submerged in the Lake. Lake Guerl√©dan is now a tourist attraction, offering various watersports, walks and panoramic views.

Biography  Bloch grew up in Beersheba and at the age of 17 moved with his family to Lehavim. He started taking piano lessons when he was 6 years old, taught himself to play the guitar and the drums, and at 14 started to write songs and to compose music. He also learned how to write computer programs at an early age on a Commodore 64, a skill he'd later use with his bandmates when they created the technology for the interactive media startup and technology startup Eko. His artistic journey started on the website Bama Hadasha (\\"New Stage\\"), which allows aspiring artists to publish their work in the fields of prose, poetry, plastic arts, music, etc. The daughter of the chairman of the record company NMC heard Bloch's songs on the site and introduced his music to her father. In a short while, Bloch's songs were heard in the radio. Today, he is a musician and tech founder, and his songs receive major airtime in Israel.  Music career His first album Ulay Ze Ani (\\"Maybe It's Me\\") was released in 2004. Most of the songs were published earlier in the website Bama Hadasha. The musical style of the album is melodic rock, and the songs moved from rhythmical songs to calm and quiet ones. The songs were written in a humorous ambiance, which was expressed either in the lyrics or in the melody. Most of the songs were written by Barak Feldman and composed by Bloch. Bloch also wrote songs for TV shows, TV realities and plays. In June 2007 Bloch released his second album Hergelim Ra'im (\\"Bad Habits\\"). Also in this album there's his cover to the ballad \\"Annabel-Lee\\" written by Edgar Allan Poe, and was translated to Hebrew by Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Bloch was a guest judge on the 5th season of the Israeli version of American Idol - \\"Kochav Nolad\\". On November 19, 2008 Bloch released his third album Al Mi Ani Oved (\\"Who am I fooling\\"), and attached to it a movie that is made of clips to all the songs of the album. In the movie Bloch dies from a broken heart. The album was written after a hard break up of Bloch and his unknown girlfriend, in most of the songs at first there's a tranquil atmosphere and towards the end it becomes a rock song.  Business career Bloch is the founder and CEO of Interlude, d.b.a.

He also served as vice-president of the United Arab Republic in 1958. Early life Al-Asali was born into a wealthy landowning family in Damascus. His uncle, Shukri al-Asali, was a prominent national leader, and a deputy in the Ottoman Parliament. Shukri al-Asali and a number of other nationalist leaders were executed in Damascus and Beirut by the Ottoman wƒÅli, Jamal Pasha, on 6 May 1916. Sabri al-Asali attended Damascus University and graduated with a law degree in 1925. That same year the Great Syrian Revolt against the French occupation erupted, and al-Asali participated in the uprising by helping smuggle arms and supplies to the Syrian fighters in the Ghouta area. Following the suppression of the revolt, al-Asali was exiled by the French authorities to Saudi Arabia where he became a special advisor to the Saudi King Abd al-Aziz, alongside another exiled Syrian leader, Shukri al- Quwatli. Political career French Mandate Al-Asali and Quwatli returned to Syria in 1932 following a general amnesty. In 1933 al-Asali, along with a number of influential Arab thinkers, became a founding member and general-secretary of the League of National Action, with the aim of countering European colonial influence. Other founding members included the historian and professor Constantin Zureiq, the philosopher Zaki al-Arsuzi and the politician Muhsin al-Barazi. The League was very successful in Syria and Lebanon, and called for the abolition of the French and British mandates and the economic integration of Arab countries. In 1936 Quwatli invited al-Asali to join the National Bloc, an umbrella group that led the political struggle against the French occupation. Al-Asali ran for parliament as a member of the Bloc and won a seat in the 1936 elections, and again in 1943, 1947, 1954, and 1962. Al- Asali served as minister of interior in the cabinet of Faris al-Khoury, and later he became minister of justice and education. In the cabinet of Saadallah al-Jabiri that was formed in October 1945, al-Asali again held the portfolios of justice and education. Al-Asali was part of the Syrian delegation that attended the founding of the Arab League in Cairo in 1945. Independence Syria regained its independence in April 1946, and al-Jabiri formed the first cabinet in post-occupation Syria, appointing al-Asali as minister of interior where he served until November 1946. When the National Bloc split to form two competing parties, the National Party and the People's Party, al-Asali joined Quwatli's National Party and led its opposition to the Hashemite influence in Syria. In 1948 al-Asali was again appointed the interior portfolio by Prime Minister Jamil Mardam Bey. His term was marred by domestic unrest resulting from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Al-Asali used a hardline approach and cracked down on the opposition. Many leading socialists were arrested on his orders, including Michel Aflaq of the Baath Party, whose arrest prompted dissent inside the cabinet and the resignation of Lutfi al-Haffar, Mardam Bey's deputy. As the turmoil spread further, al-Asali deployed the army in the streets. He became very unpopular and only narrowly survived several attempts on his life in 1948. In 1949 Chief of Staff Husni al-Za'im led a military coup that overthrew the Quwatli government. Al-Asali, along with most of Quwatli's associates, was arrested. He remained under house arrest until al-Za'im's government was overthrown by another military coup. Under the military government of Adib Shishakli, al-Asali allied himself with former president Hashim al-Atassi and conspired to bring down the Shishakli government, and restore a civilian administration to Syria. =Premiership= The Shishakli government was overthrown by a military coup in 1954. Al-Atassi was elected president and he asked al-Asali to form a cabinet. His tenure saw the assassination of Colonel Adnan al-Malki, the deputy-chief of staff, by a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP). The \\"Malki affair\\" caused outrage in the military. Al-Asali appointed Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj to lead an official tribunal which identified the SSNP with backing of the United States as the main culprits. The SSNP was outlawed and its entire leadership was arrested. During his first term as prime minister, al-Asali allied himself with the strong military, which secured him a second term in 1956. =Nasserism= Al-Asali stands next to Syrian president al-Quwatli (seated left) who, alongside Egyptian president Nasser (seated right), is signing the agreement uniting Egypt and Syria to form the United Arab Republic, 1958 Al- Asali spearheaded the Nasserist movement in Syria following the 1956 Suez Crisis, and Nasserist officials and army officers were promoted during his tenure. He was credited with convincing Quwatli, another pro-Nasser leader, to run for president again in 1955. Quwatli appointed al-Asali as his first prime minister after taking office. In January 1958 he appointed socialist leader Salah al-Din al-Bitar as foreign minister and tasked him with negotiating a full union between Egypt and Syria. President al-Quwatli and al-Asali travelled to Cairo to finalize the agreement and announced the United Arab Republic, under the leadership of Gamal Abd al-Nasser, on 1 February 1958. Al- Asali was appointed vice-president by Nasser the following day. In 1959 released documents from 1951 appeared to link him with the Iraqi government. His opponents accused him of receiving illicit funds and forced him to resign. In 1960 Al-Asali joined the Syrian opposition to the Nasser government and accused Nasser of establishing dictatorial rule in Syria. He supported the 1961 coup d'√©tat that ended the union and signed the secession declaration. Later years During the secession years al-Asali was elected to parliament but never served in any cabinet. Following the 1963 Baathi coup d'√©tat, Sabri al-Asali, considered a collaborator with the secessionist government, had his property confiscated and his civil rights revoked. He retired from public life and died in Damascus on 13 April 1976.

Biography Early life As a child growing up in Fort Worth and at his grandfather's ranch in Cuero, Graves was keenly interested in the landscape around him. He graduated from Rice Institute (now Rice University) in 1942. He subsequently served as a captain in the Marine Corps during World War II, until being wounded by a Japanese grenade on the island of Saipan. After the war, he went to graduate school at Columbia University, receiving his master's degree in 1948. While still at Columbia, in 1947, he published the short story \\"Quarry\\" in The New Yorker; he continued to publish fiction in magazines through the 1950s. He was a hard-working man. Adult life Following an early marriage and divorce, he traveled widely, spending considerable time in Spain and the Canary Islands, but returned to Texas in 1957 to care for his father, who was gravely ill. According to the Southwestern Writers Collection, which holds many of Graves's papers, \\"In November of that year, Graves completed a three-week canoe trip down part of the Brazos River that he feared was about to be changed forever by dams. His narrative chronicle of the trip was first published as a magazine article in Holiday, and later Graves added history, philosophy and folklore which resulted in his first major book, Goodbye to a River (1960). The book attracted national attention and critical praise for its original style. It won the Carr P. Collins Award of the Texas Institute of Letters in 1961 and was nominated for a National Book Award that year.\\" In 1970, Graves and his family moved onto a property near Glen Rose, Texas that Graves had named Hard Scrabble. His writing about the farm and country life continued, with Hard Scrabble: Observations on a Patch of Land, published in 1974, and From a Limestone Ledge (1980). The latter, which collected essays that Graves had published in Texas Monthly magazine, was also nominated for a National Book Award. Graves continued to write about the environment and about Texas. On July 31, 2013, he died at his home near Glen Rose, Texas, at the age of 92.

It is bordered on three of its four sides by the Pyr√©n√©es National Park.  Hydrography  The lake receives water from the Arr√©moulit Creek (coming from the Arr√©moulit Lakes), from a serpentine creek coming from the Arrious Lake Peak and from the Batboucou Lakes. The Gave du Soussou√©ou is fed by the lake. The Lac d'Artouste is also connected to the Migou√©lou Lake by an 800m gallery currently unused under the Artouste Pass by the Carnau Lakes, and in winter the Lac d'Artouste is also fed by three water cranes situated in the Azun Valley at the foot of the Bala√Øtous (Batbieilh, Batcrab√®re et Larribet), of which the water would normally run towards the gave de Pau. The dam also supplies an underground power plant under the dam (73 m drop) with an installed strength equivalent to 2634 kva. The water is then forwarded by a gallery following the rail line (recuperating the waters from each thalweg), up until Sagette, towards the penstocks of the Artouste factory, exploited by the SHEM.

The plans were that she would contest the elections, and if she won, would step down for her husband in a by- election. To fulfil his dream of becoming president in the Second Republic, she toured the length and breadth of the country with her husband campaigning. She also coordinated the women's wing of the party and was always present at all party caucuses.

Most countries, with the notable exception of the United States, have provisions requiring mandatory offers. Overview Typically, a mandatory offer must be made when the acquiring company exceeds a certain shareholding threshold in the target, or gains actual control of the target. Most countries, with the notable exception of the United States, have such a requirement. The purpose of mandatory offer regulations is to protect minority shareholders in situations where control of the target is being transferred, and in particular to discourage acquisitions driven by private benefits of control by requiring that a premium be paid for such control. Thresholds for mandatory offers vary widely between countries. A 2006 World Bank survey of the laws of 50 countries found thresholds ranging from 15% (India; became 20% in 2011) to 67% (Finland); the author's literature review did not find any study of the optimal level for the threshold. Thirty percent is a fairly common threshold, found in the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers followed in the United Kingdom as well as the laws of several other European countries. Depending on the ownership structure of the target, any given threshold short of absolute majority may in practice result in an acquirer being obliged to make an offer even when the acquirer has not yet established a controlling interest in the target, and even when another shareholder besides the acquirer retains the majority of shares; conversely, if the remaining shares not held by the acquirer are highly dispersed, actual control of the target could be attained without crossing the mandatory offer threshold. Takeover legislation in various European countries in the 1990s, for example in Austria, thus attempted to use de facto control rather than a specific threshold as the trigger for a mandatory offer; however, this presented enforcement difficulties, given that the threshold for control varied not only between target corporations but over time in the same target, and regulations later provided for a presumption of control upon achieving a specific threshold. A mandatory offer rule is distinct from tag-along rights, which give minority shareholders the right to join in any sale by the majority shareholder: the former is an obligation imposed on the acquirer by laws and regulations, while the latter may be provided voluntarily by the majority shareholder of the target to minority shareholders through unilateral announcement or in a shareholders' agreement or similar private contract. By jurisdiction Americas =Brazil= Brazilian corporate law provided for a mandatory offer rule prior to 1997. It was repealed that year, but then partially reinstated in 2000 due to pressure from institutional investors. A major transaction concluded prior to the rule's reinstatement was the Brazilian government's sale of its 66.7% of voting shares in Banco Banespa to Banco Santander, in which Banco Santander's tender offer covered only the government's state and excluded the minority shareholders. =United States= In the United States, the Williams Act of 1968, which regulates tender offers, does not contain any provisions requiring mandatory offers, due to concerns that such provisions could increase transaction costs in mergers and acquisitions. Cited in . Asia =China's mainland= A mandatory bid rule has been applicable in some form since 1993 to companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, although the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is empowered to grant exemptions, and in practise acquirers can also structure their transactions to avoid triggering the rule in many cases. For more detailed treatment, see the author's doctoral dissertation: The first version of the rule was adapted from the similar rule in Hong Kong, as at the time many state-owned enterprises of China had already listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the regulations' drafters sought advice from Hong Kong experts. The rule provided that upon acquiring 30% of the outstanding common stock of the target, the acquirer must make a bid for all remaining outstanding shares within 45 working days, at a price which at least matches the highest price paid by the acquirer in the past year for the shares it already holds, as well as the average market price of the shares within the last 30 days., citing Article 48, That rule remained in effect after the passage of the 1998 , though the 1999 law relaxed some related reporting requirements. 2002 regulations maintained the 30% threshold, but provided that the mandatory bid only had to be made if the acquirer intended to acquire more shares, and permitted the CSRC to grant exceptions to the obligation to bid., citing Articles 23‚Äì24 and 49, In 2006, both the Securities Law and the 2002 regulations were revised; Article 88 of the revised law left the 30% threshold intact, but weakened the bid requirement from the earlier mandatory bid for all outstanding shares to a bid for at least 5% of the outstanding shares. and =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong, mandatory offers have been governed since 1975 by Rule 26 of the Code on Takeovers and Mergers, issued by the Securities and Futures Commission. The code does not have force of law. However, compliance with the code is required by Listing Rule 13.23 of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. =India= In India, the mandatory bid rule originated in the 1980s as part of the listing agreement between listed companies and stock exchanges. After the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) became a statutory body with the power to issue subsidiary legislation under the SEBI Act 1992, the board promulgated the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 1994 (colloquially, the \\"Takeover Code\\"), governing takeovers, including a mandatory bid rule. A subsequent review committee chaired by former chief justice P. N. Bhagwati recommended the repeal of the 1994 regulations and their replacement by the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 1997. A third review led by Securities Appellate Tribunal chief C. Achuthan led to the replacement of the 1997 regulations by the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 2011. The mandatory bid provided for under the Takeover Code is a partial bid: it requires acquiring companies exceeding the shareholding threshold to offer to purchase some portion of the outstanding shares rather than all of them. Under the 1997 Takeover Code, the shareholding threshold was 15%; once exceeded, the acquirer would have to make an offer to purchase 20% of the outstanding shares. Under the 2011 Takeover Code, these percentages were raised to 20% and 26% respectively. The 2011 Takeover Code also provides for further mandatory bids by an incumbent who holds between 25% and 75% of a target upon an increase in holdings of at least 5% during a financial year. =South Korea= South Korea enacted a partial mandatory offer rule in January 1997 by an amendment to the . Under the rule, an acquirer which reached a 25% shareholding threshold would then have to make a bid to increase its holdings to a total amount defined by regulations; the subsequent regulatory update which took effect in April 1997 set the total amount to 50% plus one of the outstanding shares., citing Article 21 of the Article 11-2 of the However, as the financial crisis which began that year deepened, the rule was repealed the following year under pressure from the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, who believed that the rule could deter takeover bids against companies in financial distress. =Taiwan= Though the United States is the main model for Taiwan's mergers and acquisitions laws, Taiwan adopted a partial mandatory offer requirement in 2002 in Article 43-1 of the . The mechanics of the rule were largely based on United Kingdom and Hong Kong rules, although Taiwan requires only a partial offer to purchase outstanding shares, rather than the full offer required in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Europe =European Union directive= Among member states of the European Union, the 2004 Takeover Directive specifies general standards for national takeover legislation, including a mandatory offer rule, though the choice of threshold is left to individual states. =Germany= In Germany, mandatory offers are required under the . An acquiring company must make a mandatory offer upon achieving a \\"controlling interest\\" in the target, defined by ¬ß 35 of the act as a thirty percent direct or indirect shareholding. Upon reaching this threshold, the acquiring company must notify the target company and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, and make an offer in the form specified by ¬ß 11 of the act and its regulations to acquire the remaining shares. =Others= Sweden adopted a mandatory offer rule in 1999. France adopted a partial mandatory offer rule in 1989: it obligated the acquirer to offer to purchase two-thirds of the outstanding shares. In the 1990s, France's rule was expanded to require an offer to purchase 100% of outstanding shares.

The remains are approximately south-west Carmarthen and north-east of the village of Llangain. Three miles to the north-west is Carmarthen Castle, and five miles to the south-west is Llansteffan Castle. In 1917 the then Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and Monmouthshire (now RCAHMW) described the site as \\"showing a few vestiges of the foundation walls of what appears to be a 14th or early 15th century castle\\". The existence of Castell Moel in the 15th century is confirmed by a poem by Lewis Glyn Cothi, \\"I Nicolas Ryd o Castell Moel.\\" The castle stands on a plateau overlooking the River Towy, and the overgrown remains are now thought to be of a late medieval L-plan hall house, once owned by the Rede family. The main eastern block is a first floor hall and set in the re-entrant angle, is an adjoining high stair turret. The western block is a two-storey wing, with a porch and a cellar and the walls of the castle, once supported a crenellated parapet. It is doubtful that the building was ever intended to be defended. The 1917 report also stated that the remains of a motte and bailey castle were easily traceable, and that it became known as the old castle. A much more recent (sometime after 1990) visit by the Dyfed Archaeological Trust could find no trace of the older castle. The Archaeological Trust have not visited Old Castle itself and if you do then the old motte can clearly be seen as stated in the 1917 report. The Wales Coast Path (Carmarthen to Llansteffan section) passes through the associated Green Castle Woods, a nature reserve managed by the Woodland Trust.

Burch was born on 30 August 1778, in Tyrone County, Ireland, to Thomas and Eleanor Burch. He was their eldest son. Burch's parents raised him in the Church of England. Burch converted to Methodism in 1801, after hearing sermons by Gideon Ousley. Soon afterwards, his mother and siblings converted to Methodism as well. His father was already deceased. They formed a Methodist Society in Tyrone County, which soon expanded to hundreds of members.Carroll, volume I, page 281 Burch travelled to the United States, arriving on 5 June 1803. He travelled there with his mother, sister and brother Robert.Warriner (1885), 240 He settled in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, near Boehm's Chapel. Burch became active in the Methodist Church there, receiving a local preacher's licence in 1804, and being received on trial as a circuit rider by the annual Philadelphia Conference of 1805. After three years of circuit riding, Burch was promoted to the office of deacon and elder.Carroll, volume I, page 282 Within the church, Burch came to be well respected. When the first delegated annual General Methodist conference was held in 1812, Burch was sent to represent the Philadelphia Conference. At the conference Burch was assigned to Quebec City. He managed to arrive there before the outbreak of the War of 1812. Nathan Bangs, who had been assigned to Montreal, was unable to fulfill his role there, and Burch covered both circuits, focusing on the more populated Montreal Circuit. Of those circuit riders assigned to the Canadas in 1812, only Burch and Robert Hibbard managed to get across the border, and Hibbard drowned in the Saint Lawrence River soon after. Burch remained in this position for three years, as it was impossible to reassign circuit riders across the border during the war. Burch neglected his duties on the Quebec City Circuit in large part, travelling there only twice in his first year. During 1812 and 1813, membership in the Methodist Church in Quebec City dwindled from 40 individuals to 20.Carroll, volume I, page 283 After the war, Burch returned to the United States. He married Mary Smith of Philadelphia on 25 May 1816. Burch remained highly respected among his peers; he was chosen to attend the delegated conferences in 1820 and again in 1828.Warriner (1885), 242 The couple had a son, Robert A. Burch, born 4 August 1832, in Albany, New York. Other children of the couple were Mary Eleanor, Sophia Gough, Thomas, Jane Sophia, and Anne Elisabeth.Warriner (1885), 243 Burch continued circuit riding in the United States until 1835, when he was declared supernumerary due to illness. He returned to circuit riding in 1841, but retired again in 1845, as his wife had died the previous year. He retired to Yonkers, New York, where he remained until shortly before his death, when he went to live with his son, Thomas H.

In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887, the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8‚Äì0. Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep School of Chicago by a score of 20‚Äì0. At the end of the 1888 season they had a record of 1‚Äì3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan by a combined score of 43‚Äì9. Between 1887 and 1899 Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and four ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities. In 1894, James L. Morison was hired as Notre Dame's first head football coach. Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired Morison. He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: ‚ÄúI arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform‚Ä¶ They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. ‚ÄúOne big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work. Well, maybe you think I didn‚Äôt give him hell! I bet you a hundred no one ever makes a remark like that again.‚Äù Morrison had been hired for $40 plus expenses for two weeks. Notre Dame team of 1905 In 1908, the win over Franklin saw end Fay Wood catch the first touchdown pass in Notre Dame history. Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11‚Äì3 after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties. Jesse Harper became head coach in 1913 and remained so until he retired in 1917. During his tenure the Irish began playing only intercollegiate games and posted a record of 34 wins, five losses, and one tie. This period would also mark the beginning of the rivalry with Army and the continuation of rivalry with Michigan State. In 1913, Notre Dame burst into the national consciousness and helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest. In an effort to gain respect for a regionally successful but small-time Midwestern football program, Harper scheduled games in his first season with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State, and Army. Knute Rockne running for a touchdown against Army after receiving a forward pass, November 1, 1913 On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the Black Knights of the Hudson 35‚Äì13 in a game played at West Point. Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and end Knute Rockne‚Äîwho was soon to be legendary coach‚Äîthe Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass. Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full-stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today. Knute Rockne era (1918‚Äì1930) Coach Rockne Irish assistant Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918. Under Rockne, the Irish would post a record of 105 wins, 12 losses, and five ties. The 105 wins account for 12.3% of all wins in Notre Dame football history. During his 13 years, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and produced players such as George Gipp and the \\"Four Horsemen\\". Knute Rockne has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football history. Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7‚Äì2‚Äì2 scheme. Rockne took over in the war-torn season of 1918 and posted a 3‚Äì1‚Äì2 record; he lost only to the Michigan Agricultural Aggies. He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, Ohio and earned a 26‚Äì6 victory. Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau were in the backfield. With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass. The 1919 team had Rockne handle the line and Gus Dorais handle the backfield. The team went undefeated and won the national championship. George Gipp, \\"The Gipper\\" Gipp died at age 25 on December 14, 1920, just two weeks after Walter Camp elected him as Notre Dame's first All- American. Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game on November 20 against Northwestern. Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals. Rockne was speaking to Gipper on his hospital bed when he was purported to have delivered the famous, \\"Win one for the Gipper\\" line. Roger Kiley John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10‚Äì1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns. Grantland Rice wrote that \\"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \\"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\\" Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes. The national champion 1924 team included the \\"Four Horsemen\\" backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden. The line was known as the \\"Seven Mules\\". The Irish capped an undefeated, 10‚Äì0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl. The 1926 team beat Army and was led by Christie Flanagan. For all his success, Rockne also made what an Associated Press writer called \\"one of the greatest coaching blunders in history.\\" Instead of coaching his team against Carnegie Tech, Rockne traveled to Chicago for the Army‚ÄìNavy Game to \\"write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team.\\" Carnegie Tech used the coach's absence as motivation for a 19‚Äì0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title. The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech. \\"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man-Peter Pund,\\" said Rockne. \\"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\\" Among the events that occurred during Rockne's tenure none may be more famous than the Rockne's Win one for the Gipper speech. Army came into the 1928 matchup undefeated and was the clear favorite. Notre Dame, on the other hand, was having their worst season under Rockne's leadership and entered the game with a 4‚Äì2 record. At the end of the half Army was leading and looked to be in command of the game. Rockne entered the locker room and gave his account of Gipp's final words: \\"I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.\\" The speech inspired the team and they went on to upset Army and win the game 12‚Äì6. The 1929 and 1930 teams both went undefeated, winning national championships, and the 1930 team was led by the likes of Frank Carideo, Joe Savoldi, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill. It featured the first and only example of all four members of a backfield being named to an All-American team during the same season. The 1929 team played all of its games on the road while the new Notre Dame Stadium was being built. In 1930, \\"Jumping Joe\\" Savoldi scored the first Notre Dame touchdown in the new stadium on a 98-yard kickoff return. Savoldi is also known as \\"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame's Stadium\\" based on scoring three touchdowns in the official stadium dedication game against Navy the following week. Rockne coached his last game on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City. The game raised funds for the Mayor's Relief Committee for the unemployed and needy of the city. 50,000 fans turned out to see the reunited \\"Four Horsemen\\" along with players from Rockne's other championship teams take the field against the pros.New York Times December 15, 1930 On March 31, 1931, Rockne died at age 43 in the crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air airliner in Kansas; he was on his way to help in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame. The crash site is located in a remote expanse of Kansas known as the Flint Hills and now features a Rockne Memorial. As Notre Dame's head coach from 1918 to 1930, Rockne posted what has remained for decades the all-time highest winning percentage (.881) for a football coach in the NCAA's flagship FBS division. During his 13-year tenure as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Rockne collected 105 victories, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships. Rockne also coached Notre Dame to 5 undefeated and untied seasons. Heartley Anderson (1931‚Äì1933) Through game broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio, Notre Dame football gained a nationwide following of \\"subway alumni\\", Catholics who became fans whether or not they attended the university. Former Saint Louis head coach Heartley \\"Hunk\\" Anderson was promoted from assistant coach and took the helm of the Irish after Knute Rockne's death, leading them to a record of 16 wins, nine losses, and two ties. Anderson was a former Irish player under Rockne and was serving as an assistant coach at the time of Rockne's death. Anderson resigned as Irish head coach after the 1933 season to accept the position of head football coach at NC State. Notre Dame finished 6‚Äì2‚Äì1 in 1931. The Irish began the season with a 25‚Äì0 win over Indiana, Notre Dame tied Northwestern in the season's second game. Anderson's squad then demolished Drake by a score of 63‚Äì0. After defeating Pittsburgh by a score of 25‚Äì12, the Fighting Irish shut out their next three opponents; Carnegie Mellon, Pennsylvania and Navy. The Irish lost a heartbreaker by a score of 16‚Äì14 to USC on November 21 that snapped the Irish's 26-game non-losing streak. Army shut out the Irish by a score of 12‚Äì0 on November 28 to finish the Irish's season. The Irish went 7‚Äì2 in 1932. Anderson's team began with three blowout victories; 73‚Äì0 over Haskell, 62‚Äì0 over Drake and 42‚Äì0 over Carnegie Mellon. The Irish then faced Pittsburgh in front of a then-record crowd of 62,000, losing by a score of 12‚Äì0. Notre Dame bounced back to win its next four; 24‚Äì6 over Kansas, 21‚Äì0 over Northwestern, 12‚Äì0 over Navy and 21‚Äì0 over Army in front of a new record crowd on 80,000. Anderson's Irish closed the season on a sour note, losing to USC by a score of 13‚Äì0. 1933 was a tough year for the Irish as they finished with a 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 record. Notre Dame began the season in a scoreless tie with Kansas. After defeating Indiana by a score of 12‚Äì2, ND suffered a four-game losing streak, failing to score a point in all four losses to Carnegie Tartan, Pittsburgh, Navy. and Purdue. Notre Dame ended the losing streak by defeating Northwestern by a score of 7‚Äì0. The Fighting Irish closed the season with a 19‚Äì0 loss to USC and a 13‚Äì12 win over Army. Elmer Layden (1934‚Äì1940) Anderson was replaced by Elmer Layden, who was one of Rockne's \\"Four Horsemen\\" in the 1920s. After graduating, Layden played professional football for one year and then began a coaching career. The Irish posted a record of 47 wins, 13 losses, and three ties in seven years under Layden, the most successful record of a Notre Dame coach not to win a national championship. He left Notre Dame after the 1940 season to become Commissioner of the National Football League. Layden's 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State by a score of 18‚Äì13. His 1938 team finished 8‚Äì1, losing only to USC in the season finale. This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System. Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame during his time as head coach. He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools. The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win. They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again. By the time they met again in 1943, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place. Unlike the easygoing Layden, Leahy was intense, and after the Irish had thrashed Michigan by a score of 35‚Äì12 in 1943, Wolverine coach and athletic director Fritz Crisler never scheduled the Irish again. Frank Leahy era (1941‚Äì1953) Coach Leahy Boston College head coach Frank Leahy was hired by Notre Dame to take over for Layden in 1941, and was another former Irish player who played during the Rockne era. After graduating from Notre Dame, Leahy held several coaching positions, including line coach of the \\"Seven Blocks of Granite\\" of Fordham University that helped that team win all but two of their games between 1935 and 1937. He then coached the Boston College Eagles to a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and a share of the national championship. His move to Notre Dame began a new period of gridiron success for the Irish, and ensured Leahy's place among the winningest coaches in the history of college football. Leahy coached the team for 11 seasons, from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1953. He has the second highest winning percentage (.864) of any college coach in history. He led the Irish to a record of 87 wins, 11 losses, and nine ties including 39 consecutive games without a loss (37‚Äì0‚Äì2), four national championships, and six undefeated seasons. A fifth national championship was lost because of a 1953 tie against Iowa, in a game that featured 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner that caused a minor scandal at the time, when it appeared that some Irish players had faked injuries to stop the clock, leading some to nickname those players the \\"Fainting Irish\\". From 1944 to 1945, Leahy served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as a Captain. Edward McKeever, Leahy's assistant coach, became interim head coach when Leahy left for the Navy. During his one year at the helm (1944) the Irish managed 8 wins and 2 losses. McKeever left Notre Dame in 1945 to take over as head coach of Cornell. He was replaced by Hugh Devore for the 1945 season who led the Irish to a 7‚Äì2‚Äì1 record. Leahy retired in 1954 reportedly due to health issues. Perhaps the best example of this occurred during the Georgia Tech game in 1953. Leahy fell ill during the game, which led to him collapsing during halftime. The situation was so dire that a priest was called in to give Leahy the last rites. However, Leahy recovered, and the consequent diagnosis was that he was suffering from nervous tension and pancreatitis.Gildea, William; Jennison, Christopher (1976). The Fighting Irish: Notre Dame Football Through the Years. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice- Hall. Terry Brennan (1954‚Äì1958) The departure of Frank Leahy ushered in a downward slope in Notre Dame's performance, referred to in various circles as a period of de-emphasis. 25-year old assistant coach Terry Brennan was hired as Frank Leahy's successor as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. When asked if he thought he was too young to be a head coach at the age of 25, Brennan replied, \\"Oh, I don't know. I'll be 26 in a few months.\\" He departed with a total of 32 wins and 18 losses. But note: the 32 wins included 17 in 1954 and 1955. From 1956 to 1958 his record was 15‚Äì15. Brennan was a former player under Leahy and before joining the Irish had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago and later the freshman squad and assistant at Notre Dame. His first two seasons the Irish were ranked fourth and ninth respectively. It was the 1956 season that began to darken his reputation, for it became one of the most dismal in the team's history and saw them finish the season with a mere two wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa. One bright spot in the 1956 season was the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Paul Hornung, who would go on to a legendary NFL career with the Green Bay Packers. To date, Hornung is the only Heisman winner to win the award while playing for a team that had a losing record. The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7‚Äì3 and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, that ended the Sooners' still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins. In Brennan's final season, though, the Irish finished 6‚Äì4. Brennan was fired in mid-December. Brennan's tenure can only be properly framed with the understanding that in a time of zero scholarship limitations in college football, Notre Dame's administration inexplicably began a process of deemphasizing football, severely cutting scholarships and hindering Brennan from building a roster of any meaningful depth. Joe Kuharich (1959‚Äì1963) Former San Francisco, Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins head coach Joe Kuharich took the head coaching position at Notre Dame in 1959, realizing a longtime ambition to return to his alma mater. He had earlier been courted by Notre Dame after the 1956 season, after the Irish finished 2‚Äì8, but before he had a chance to accept an offer, Terry Brennan was given a reprieve. He brought a professional touch to Irish football, putting shamrocks on the players' helmets and shoulder stripes on their jerseys. Kuharich compiled a 17‚Äì23 record over four non-winning seasons and remains to this day the only coach ever to have an overall losing record at Notre Dame. Included was a school-record eight-game losing streak in 1960, a year in which the Irish finished 2‚Äì8. It was one of the worst stretches in program history. The consensus opinion was that Kuharich never made the adjustment from pro football to college football, attempting to use complicated pro coaching techniques with collegiate players, and never adapted to the limited substitution rules in effect at the time, having big, immobile linemen playing both ways in an era where smaller, quicker players were preferred. He often said, \\"You win some and you lose some\\", and seemed perfectly content finishing 5‚Äì5 every year. This did not sit well with the Irish faithful, who expected Notre Dame to beat everybody. When the pressure of winning became too much to bear, Kuharich resigned in the spring of 1963 and assumed the post of supervisor of NFL officials. Because it was so late in the spring, Hugh Devore was named head coach for the 1963 season while the search for a permanent replacement was being conducted. The players that he recruited came to within 93 seconds of an undefeated season and a national championship in 1964 under first-year coach Ara Parseghian. Despite his unsuccessful Notre Dame tenure, Kuharich remains the only Irish coach to post back-to-back shutouts over their greatest rival, the University of Southern California Trojans in 1960 (17‚Äì0) and 1961 (30‚Äì0). Kuharich was involved in a game whose controversial ending resulted in a rule change still in effect today. In 1961, Notre Dame faced Syracuse at home and trailed, 15‚Äì14, with three seconds left to play. A desperation 56-yard field goal attempt fell short as time ran out, and Syracuse appeared to have won the game. But the Orangemen were penalized 15 yards for roughing the placekick holder, and given a second chance with no time showing on the clock, Notre Dame kicker Joe Perkowski drilled a 41-yard field goal for a 17‚Äì15 Irish victory. Syracuse immediately cried foul, claiming that under the existing rules, the second kick should not have been allowed because time had expired. It never was clear whether the officials had erred in allowing the extra play, and the Irish victory was permitted to stand. As a result of this game, the rule was clarified to state that a half cannot end on an accepted defensive foul‚Äîconsistent with the officials' ruling in this game. Ara Parseghian era (1964‚Äì1974) Ara Parseghian Statue, dedicated September 22, 2007 In 1964, Ara Parseghian left his job as the Northwestern head football coach when he was hired to take over the coaching duties at Notre Dame. He immediately brought the team back to a level of success in Irish football history that was comparable only to Rockne and Leahy. These three coaches have an 80% or greater winning percentage while at Notre Dame ‚Äì Rockne at .881, Leahy at .864, and Parseghian at .836. Parseghian's teams never won fewer than seven nor lost more than three games during the ten game regular seasons of the era. In his first year, the Irish improved their record to 9‚Äì1, but they lost the national championship in the last game of the season at USC when Craig Fertig connected with a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman. Parseghian earned coach of the year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and The Sporting News, as well as several others, and a cover story in Time magazine. Parseghian was also named coach of the year by several selectors in his national championship years of 1966 and 1973 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980. It was under Parseghian as well that Notre Dame lifted its 40-plus year-old \\"no bowl games\\" policy,} beginning with the season of 1969, after which the Irish played the No. 1 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing in the final minutes in a closely contested game. The following year, Parseghian's 9‚Äì1 squad ended Texas' Southwest Conference record 30-game winning streak in the 1971 Cotton Bowl. During his eleven-year career, the Irish amassed a record of 95‚Äì17‚Äì4 and captured two national championships as well as the MacArthur Bowl in 1964. The Irish also had undefeated seasons in 1966 and 1973, had three major bowl wins in five appearances, and produced one Heisman Trophy winner (John Huarte in 1964). In 1971, Cliff Brown became the first African-American quarterback to start a game for the program. Due to health issues, Parseghian was forced to retire from coaching after the 1974 season. Dan Devine (1975‚Äì1980) Coach Devine Dan Devine was hired to take over as head coach upon Parseghian's departure from Notre Dame in 1975. Devine was already a highly successful coach and had led Arizona State, Missouri, and the NFL's Green Bay Packers. Devine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired. When approached for the job following Parseghian's resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history. When he arrived at Notre Dame he already had a college coaching record of 120 wins, 40 losses, and eight ties and had led his teams to victory in four bowl games. At Notre Dame he would lead the Irish to 53 wins, 16 losses, and a tie as well as three bowl victories. His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when Notre Dame won the 1977 national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana. The championship season climaxed with a 38‚Äì10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell. The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls. Earlier in the season, before the annual game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team's jerseys from navy blue & white to kelly green & gold, later known as the \\"green jersey game\\" resulting in a 49‚Äì19 victory over the Trojans. The Irish continued to wear green for the rest of Devine's tenure at the school. Like Joe Kuharich before him, Devine was involved in a game while at Notre Dame whose ending resulted in a rule change still in effect today. On September 15, 1979, the Irish faced the Michigan Wolverines in Ann Arbor in their season opener. With six seconds remaining, Michigan lined up for a game-winning field goal attempt. Notre Dame linebacker Bob Crable climbed up onto the back of opposing long snapper Mike Trgovac and was able to block the kick, preserving a 12‚Äì10 Irish victory. A new rule was implemented the following season that prohibited this tactic. Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship. After a 5‚Äì2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances). Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, \\"Dump Devine\\" bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium. He also had the notoriety of losing to his old program, a shocking 3‚Äì0 loss to the Tigers at South Bend in 1978. On August 15, 1980, Devine announced that he would be leaving Notre Dame at the end of season, saying he wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife. He moved back to Arizona and became a fundraiser for Arizona State University's Sun Devil Foundation. In 1985, he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, and then returned to his old school at Missouri seven years later as athletic director to help navigate the school through financial troubles. Devine was inducted into the inaugural class of the University of Minnesota Duluth Athletic Hall of Fame in 1991. Gerry Faust (1981‚Äì1985) Gerry Faust was hired to replace Devine in 1981. Prior to Notre Dame, Faust had been one of the more successful high school football coaches in the country. As coach of Moeller High School in Cincinnati he amassed a 174‚Äì17‚Äì2 record over 19 seasons. Many of his players had gone on to play for Notre Dame; indeed, when he arrived in South Bend, he was reunited with nine of his former players from Moeller. Despite his success in the high school ranks, Faust's success at Notre Dame was mixed and his record mediocre at best. In his first season, the Irish finished 5‚Äì6. In Faust's second season, Notre Dame improved slightly to 6‚Äì4‚Äì1. The most successful years under Faust were the 1983 and 1984 campaigns where the Irish finished 7‚Äì5 and made trips to the Liberty Bowl and Aloha Bowl respectively. His final record at Notre Dame was 30‚Äì26‚Äì1. To avoid being fired, Faust resigned at the end of the 1985 season, following fan cries of \\"Oust Faust\\". He announced his resignation prior to the final game of the year, where Notre Dame suffered a humiliating 58‚Äì7 loss at Miami; Allen Pinkett scored the Irish TD. Faust proceeded to take over as head coach at Akron. Lou Holtz era (1986‚Äì1996) Coach Holtz Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish. He had previously been head coach of William & Mary, North Carolina State, the NFL's New York Jets, Arkansas, and Minnesota. Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985, finishing with an identical record of 5 wins and 6 losses. However, unlike the 1985 squad, which was generally outcoached and outplayed, Holtz's 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game, losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points. That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95‚Äì24‚Äì2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100‚Äì30‚Äì2 record overall. In 1987, Holtz led the Irish to an 8‚Äì4 record. Notre Dame's best player was star wide receiver Tim Brown, who would win the Heisman Trophy that season and is Notre Dame's seventh and last Heisman winner to date. The season began with the Irish defeating #9 Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan by a score of 26‚Äì7. The next week, the Irish defeated #17 Michigan State by a score of 31‚Äì8. After defeating Purdue, the Irish lost to Pittsburgh and lost starting quarterback Terry Andrysiak to injury during the game. With sophomore quarterback Tony Rice under center, the Irish reeled off five straight wins, beginning with Air Force, then USC, Navy, Boston College and #10 Alabama. Notre Dame would then lose their last three to close the season, starting with Penn State, then #2 Miami and Texas A&M; in the Cotton Bowl. In contrast to Faust, Holtz was well known as a master motivator and a strict disciplinarian. The tone was set with Holtz's first meeting with his team as Irish head coach in 1986, immediately demanding his players sit up straight in their chairs and look him in the eye as he spoke. He displayed the latter trait in spades when two of his top contributing players showed up late for dinner right before the then top-ranked Irish played second-ranked USC in the final regular season game of 1988. In a controversial move, coach Lou Holtz took his 10‚Äì0 Irish squad to Los Angeles without stars Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks, who he suspended for disciplinary reasons. This was not the first time these players had gotten into trouble and the players had been warned there would be serious consequences if it happened again. His move was vindicated when the Irish defeated USC anyway. Holtz was named national coach of the year (Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant Award) in 1988, the same season he took Notre Dame to an upset of No. 1 Miami in the Catholics vs. Convicts series and a win over No. 3 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl, thus capturing the national championship. The Irish finished a perfect 12‚Äì0 in 1988, its last undefeated season and national championship to date. Occasionally, despite his lack of success with the N.Y. Jets, he was rumored to be leaving Notre Dame for the NFL. Following a 6‚Äì10 season in 1990 and an 8‚Äì8 showing in 1991, the Minnesota Vikings were rumored to replace Jerry Burns with Holtz. However, Holtz denied these rumors each of those two seasons. Holtz remained at Notre Dame; the Vikings, meanwhile, hired Dennis Green to replace the retired Jerry Burns. Holtz nearly replaced Green five years later after retiring from Notre Dame. The 1988 national champion Fighting Irish visited President Ronald Reagan in the White House in January 1989. In 1989, Holtz led the Irish to a 12‚Äì1 record. The Irish began the season in the Kickoff Classic game in East Rutherford, New Jersey against Virginia. The Irish won by a score of 36‚Äì13. Next, top-ranked Notre Dame defeated #2 Michigan by a score of 24‚Äì19. That was followed by wins over Michigan State, Purdue, Stanford, #17 Air Force, #9 USC, #7 Pittsburgh, Navy, SMU and #17 Penn State. The Irish would lose to #7 Miami the following week, ending Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak. Holtz would lead the Irish to a victory in the Orange Bowl over #1 Colorado to end the season. Holtz led the Fighting Irish to a 9‚Äì3 record in 1990. The season began with a #1 ranking and a victory over #4 Michigan by a score of 28‚Äì24. The Irish defeated #24 Michigan State the following week then beat Purdue. The Irish would suffer its first defeat of the season the next week, losing to Stanford by a score of 36‚Äì31. The Irish would rebound to post five consecutive wins, defeating Air Force, #2 Miami, Pittsburgh, Navy and #9 Tennessee. After losing 24‚Äì21 to #22 Penn State, the Irish defeated USC by a score of 10‚Äì6 in the regular season finale. The Irish would get a rematch with Colorado in the Orange Bowl but would lose by a score of 10‚Äì9. The Fighting Irish would go 10‚Äì3 in 1991. After defeating Indiana to open the season, the Irish lost to #4 Michigan by a score of 24‚Äì14. The Irish won their next seven, defeating Michigan State, Purdue, Stanford, #12 Pittsburgh, Air Force, USC and Navy. The Irish would suffer a defeat to #13 Tennessee at home, blowing a 24-point lead to lose by a score of 35‚Äì34. Notre Dame would then lose back-to-back games for the first time since 1987 when they lost to unranked Penn State, their first loss to an unranked opponent also since 1987. The Irish would close out the regular season with a victory over Hawaii by a score of 48‚Äì42. The Irish would receive a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they defeated Florida by a score of 39‚Äì28. In 1992, Notre Dame finished 10‚Äì1‚Äì1. After defeating Northwestern to start the season, the Fighting Irish tied #5 Michigan, their first tie of the Holtz era. After defeating Michigan State and Purdue, the Irish lost to #19 Stanford by a score of 33‚Äì16. Notre Dame would win out for the rest of the season, defeating Pittsburgh, BYU, Navy, #9 Boston College, #21 Penn State, #23 USC and the Cotton Bowl against #3 Texas A&M.; The Irish would enjoy another successful season in 1993, finishing the season at 11‚Äì1. After scoring 27 points in wins over Northwestern and #2 Michigan to start the season, the Irish defeated Michigan State, Purdue, Pittsburgh, BYU, USC, Navy and #1 Florida State. However, a loss to #12 Boston College on a game-winning field goal as time expired by a score of 41‚Äì39 ended the Irish's national championship aspirations. The Irish would face a rematch with #6 Texas A&M; in the Cotton Bowl to finish the season, a game the Irish won by a score of 24‚Äì21. In 1994, Holtz led Notre Dame to a 6‚Äì5‚Äì1 record, the Irish's worst record since Holtz's first season in 1986. The Irish would begin by defeating Northwestern but would lose to #5 Michigan by a score of 26‚Äì24. The Irish defeated Michigan State the following week by a score of 21‚Äì20. After wins over Purdue and Stanford, the Irish would lose three of their next four to drop out of the rankings for the first time since 1986. After beating Navy, the Fighting Irish lost to #6 Florida State by a score of 23‚Äì16. After beating Air Force, Notre Dame tied USC and lost to #5 Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl by a score of 41‚Äì24. The Irish would improve to 9‚Äì3 in 1995. Despite getting upset by Northwestern to begin the season, the Irish won their next three, defeating Purdue, Vanderbilt (a game in which Coach Holtz missed because of a health issue and defensive coordinator Bob Davie filled in as head coach for the game), and #10 Texas. After losing to #6 Ohio State, the Irish reeled off six straight wins, defeating #15 Washington, Army, #5 USC, Boston College, Navy and Air Force. The Irish finished the 1995 campaign by losing to #8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl. Lou Holtz's last season at Notre Dame in 1996 resulted in an 8‚Äì3 record. After defeating Vanderbilt, Purdue and #8 Texas, the Irish lost to #4 Ohio State. Notre Dame would finish the season with a win over #16 Washington, a loss to Air Force in overtime, a win over Navy, a win over Boston College, a win over Pittsburgh, a win over Rutgers and an overtime loss to USC, snapping the Irish's 13-game non-losing streak against the Trojans. Holtz's option offense, which helped catapult Notre Dame to many victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also helped rack up impressive recruiting classes. During the 1989 season, Holtz had the following future NFL players on offense: QB Rick Mirer, RB Ricky Watters, RB Anthony Johnson, RB Rodney Culver, RB Dorsey Levens, and WR Raghib Ismail. In 1990, he added RB Jeff Burris (who would later move to Safety), FB Jerome Bettis and TE Irv Smith. 1991 saw the additions of RB Reggie Brooks and FB Ray Zellars. 1992 saw the addition of WR Derrick Mayes. For 1993, he added FB Marc Edwards. In 1995, he added RB Autry Denson. From the 1987‚Äì1991 NFL Drafts, there were 33 Notre Dame players selected. From the 1992‚Äì1995 NFL Drafts, there were 32 Notre Dame players selected. Overall, Holtz took Notre Dame to one undefeated season, nine consecutive New Year's Day bowl games, and top 10 finishes in the AP poll in five seasons. Holtz retired from Notre Dame following the 1996 season, but would unretire in 1999 to accept the head coaching position at South Carolina where he would serve until the completion of the 2004 season. Bob Davie (1997‚Äì2001) Coach Davie Bob Davie, who had been Holtz's defensive coordinator from 1994 to 1996, was promoted to head coach when Holtz retired. Davie, who turned down a head coaching offer from Purdue to accept the Irish's head coaching position, was a well-respected defensive mind who had also served as defensive coordinator at Tulane and Texas A&M.; Davie had also filled in as head coach for one game during the 1995 season when Lou Holtz was dealing with a health issue. One of his first major decisions was to fire long-time offensive line coach Joe Moore, who then successfully sued the university for age discrimination.Lieberman, Richard. Personal Foul: Coach Joe Moore vs. The University of Notre Dame. Academy Chicago Publishers, 2001. On Davie's watch, the team suffered three bowl game losses (1997 Independence Bowl, 1999 Gator Bowl, and 2001 Fiesta Bowl), and it failed to qualify for a bowl game in two others (1999 and 2001). The highlight of Davie's tenure was a 36‚Äì20 upset win in 1998 over #5 Michigan, the defending national champions. Davie's Irish also posted a 25‚Äì24 home victory over USC in 1999. Davie nearly defeated top ranked Nebraska in 2000, with the Irish comeback bid falling short in overtime 27‚Äì24. The aforementioned 2001 Fiesta Bowl was Notre Dame's first invitation to the Bowl Championship Series. The Irish lost by 32 points to Oregon State, but would finish No. 15 in the AP Poll, Davie's highest ranking as head coach. The 2001 squad was awarded the American Football Coaches Association Achievement Award for its 100% graduation rate. On December 17, 1999, Notre Dame was placed on probation by the NCAA for the only time in its history. The association's Committee on Infractions found two series of violations. The New York Times reported \\"the main one involved the actions of a booster, Kimberly Dunbar, who lavished gifts on football players with money she later pleaded guilty to embezzling.\\" In the second series of events, a football player was accused of trying to sell several complimentary game tickets and of using others as repayment of a loan. The player was also said \\"to have been romantically involved with a woman (not Dunbar), a part- time tutor at the university, who wrote a term paper for another player for a small fee and provided players with meals, lodging and gifts.\\" The Dunbar violation began while Lou Holtz was head coach: \\"According to the NCAA committee report, Dunbar, the woman at the center of the more serious violations, had become romantically involved with several Notre Dame football players from June 1995 to January 1998 and had a child with one, Jarvis Edison.\\" Notre Dame was placed on probation for two years and lost one of its 85 football scholarships each year in what the Times termed \\"minor\\" penalties. Following the 1998 season, the team fell into a pattern of frustrating inconsistency and alternated between successful and mediocre seasons. Despite Davie's rocky tenure, new athletic director Kevin White gave the coach a contract extension following the Fiesta Bowl-capped 2000 season, then saw the team start 0‚Äì3 in 2001 ‚Äì the first such start in school history. Disappointed by the on-field results, coupled with the Joe Moore and Kim Dunbar scandals, the administration decided to dismiss Davie after the 2001 season. His final record at Notre Dame was 35‚Äì25. After departing Notre Dame, Davie accepted an offer from ESPN to serve as a play-by-play broadcast college football analyst, a position he would hold for ten years before New Mexico hired him to be their head football coach in December 2011. =George O'Leary controversy= On December 9, 2001, Notre Dame hired George O'Leary, the head coach at Georgia Tech, to replace Davie. However, while researching a \\"local boy done good\\" story on O'Leary, (Manchester) Union Leader reporter Jim Fennell uncovered misrepresentations in O'Leary's resume that had influenced the administration's decision to hire him. The resulting media scandal embarrassed Notre Dame officials, and tainted O'Leary; he resigned five days later, before coaching a single practice, recruiting a single player, or hiring a single assistant coach. O'Leary's tenure is the shortest of any head coach in FBS history. O'Leary would go on to become the head football coach at the University of Central Florida. Tyrone Willingham (2002‚Äì2004) Once again in need of a new head coach, the school turned to Tyrone Willingham, the head coach at Stanford. Willingham's hiring made him the first African American head coach in Notre Dame football history. Bringing a feeling of change and excitement to campus, Willingham led the 2002 squad to a 10‚Äì2 regular season record, including an 8‚Äì0 start with wins over #7 Michigan and #11 Florida State, and a No. 4 ranking. This great early start, however, would be the lone highlight of Willingham's tenure, as Notre Dame finished the year with a heart-breaking loss to Boston College, then lopsided losses to USC and North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl. The program faltered over the next two seasons under Willingham, compiling an 11‚Äì12 record. During this time, Notre Dame lost a game by at least 30 points on five occasions. Furthermore, Willingham's 2004 recruiting class was judged by analysts to be the worst at Notre Dame in more than two decades. Citing Notre Dame's third consecutive four-touchdown loss to arch-rival USC compounded by another year of sub-par recruiting efforts, the Willingham era ended on November 30, 2004 (after the conclusion of the 2004 season) when the university chose to terminate him and pay out the remainder of Willingham's six-year contract. Willingham wouldn't be unemployed for long, however, as he would accept the head coaching position at Washington two weeks after he was fired by the Irish. Charlie Weis (2005‚Äì2009) Coach Weis After Willingham's firing, Notre Dame initially pursued Utah head coach Urban Meyer, who had been an Irish assistant from 1996‚Äì2000. After Meyer accepted the Florida head coaching position and turned down the Irish, Charlie Weis left the NFL's New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls as offensive coordinator, to become head football coach for the Irish beginning with the 2005 season. Weis' hiring as the Irish's 30th head football coach made him the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the football head coaching position on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich (a 1938 Notre Dame graduate). In his inaugural season he led Notre Dame to a record of 9‚Äì3, including an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl, where they were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes 34‚Äì20. In the first half of the first game (against Pittsburgh), Notre Dame had gained more offensive yards than it had in five games combined, during the previous season. On September 25, Weis and the Irish traveled to Seattle, Washington to face Washington and former head coach Tyrone Willingham, who was hired by the Huskies to be their head coach two weeks after getting fired at Notre Dame. The Irish won by a score of 36‚Äì17. Quarterback Brady Quinn would go on to break numerous team passing records that season and rise to the national spotlight, by holding 35 Notre Dame records as well as becoming a top Heisman Trophy contender. Wide receiver Jeff Samardzija would be the team's leading receiver and would go on to a successful career in Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the San Francisco Giants. Tight end Anthony Fasano would be another key offensive player during the 2005 season who would go on to an NFL career with the Dallas Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, Kansas City Chiefs and Tennessee Titans. During the 2005 season, Notre Dame signed Weis to a big raise and ten-year contract extension that was set to keep the coach in South Bend through the 2015 season. Weis and the Irish went into the 2006 season with a No. 2 preseason ranking in the ESPN/Coaches Poll. They finished the regular season with a 10‚Äì2 record, losing only to Michigan and USC. Notre Dame accepted a bid to the 2007 Sugar Bowl, losing to LSU 41‚Äì14. This marked their ninth consecutive post-season loss, the longest drought in NCAA history. As a result, Notre Dame dropped to No. 17 in the final rankings. In the wake of a graduating class that sent eleven players to the NFL, the 2007 season (3‚Äì9) included various negative milestones: the most losses in a single year (9); two of the ten worst losses ever (38‚Äì0 losses to both Michigan and USC); and the first 6-game losing streak for home games. The Naval Academy recorded their first win over the Irish since 1963, breaking the NCAA-record 43-game streak. In 2008, the Irish started 4‚Äì1, but completed the regular season with a 6‚Äì6 record, including a 24‚Äì23 home loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen would be the team's star player, completing over 60% of his passes his sophomore season in 2008. Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, it was announced he would remain head coach. Weis's Notre Dame squad ended the season breaking the Irish's NCAA record nine-game bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii, 49‚Äì21, in the Hawaii Bowl. After the 2008 season, offensive coordinator Mike Haywood left to accept the head coaching position at Miami (OH). Instead of hiring a replacement, Weis elected to assume offensive coordinator duties himself, which included calling the plays. Charlie Weis entered the 2009 season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth. Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4‚Äì2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Many of their wins were also close, aside from a 35‚Äì0 victory over Nevada and a 40‚Äì14 defeat of Washington State. Sitting at 6‚Äì2, however, Notre Dame lost a close game at Notre Dame Stadium to Navy, 23‚Äì21. This loss was the second to Navy in the last three years, and would be the first loss in a four-game losing streak to finish the season. The following week, Notre Dame lost to #8 Pittsburgh, then lost to UConn at home in double overtime on senior day. The Irish lost to Stanford the last week of the season by a score of 45‚Äì38. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and wide receiver Golden Tate would forgo their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft. Weis was fired on November 30, 2009, exactly five years after his predecessor. According to Weis' buyout, he was to be paid $6 million then $2.05 million annually until the contract ran out in December 2015 for a total of about $19 million. During that time, Weis made more money annually not to coach the Irish than his successor, Brian Kelly, made to coach the team. After leaving Notre Dame, Weis would serve as offensive coordinator for the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs in 2010 as well as Florida under Will Muschamp in 2011 before accepting the head coaching position at Kansas in December 2011. His hiring made him the fifth consecutive former Notre Dame head coach (sixth counting George O'Leary) to be hired as head coach by another FBS school; joining Gerry Faust (Akron), Lou Holtz (South Carolina), Bob Davie (New Mexico) and Tyrone Willingham (Washington). O'Leary was hired by Central Florida. Brian Kelly (2010‚Äìpresent) Coach Kelly Brian Kelly became the 31st head coach of the Fighting Irish on December 10, 2009, after coaching Cincinnati to a 12‚Äì0 record and BCS bowl-game berth, but he left the team before the bowl game. In his first season, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to an 8‚Äì5 record. Tragedy struck early in the season when Declan Sullivan, a junior working for the athletic department, died while filming a practice on a scissor lift in dangerously high winds. Dayne Crist started the season at quarterback but was injured for a second consecutive year, this time in the Tulsa game, which the Irish lost. Kelly turned to freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, who led the Irish to victories in the last three games against No. 14 Utah, Army in Yankee Stadium, and breaking an eight-year losing streak to USC in the LA Coliseum. Kelly guided the Irish to a 33‚Äì17 win over Miami (FL) in the 2010 Sun Bowl to finish 2010 with an 8‚Äì5 record. With senior wide out Michael Floyd returning for his senior season and an outstanding recruiting class that included several highly touted defensive linemen, Kelly and the Irish looked to improve on their 8‚Äì5 record from the prior year. However, an early season upset to a Skip Holtz-led South Florida team, and a last second loss to Michigan in Ann Arbor left the Irish at 0‚Äì2 to start the season. The Irish bounced back to beat #15 Michigan State and had two 4-game winning-streaks, with the only loss during that stretch coming at the hands of USC. The Irish also broke Navy's 2-game winning streak over Notre Dame (2009‚Äì10). Notre Dame finished the season with an 8‚Äì4 record but lost 18‚Äì14 to Florida State in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl, concluding the 2011 campaign with and 8‚Äì5 record overall, identical to the 2010 season. In the team's losses, multiple turnovers from the quarterback position were often the culprit, and as a whole turnovers at critical times in the game often derailed potential Irish comebacks. After the 2011 season, offensive coordinator Charley Molnar left ND to accept the head coaching position at UMass. Safeties coach and recruiting coordinator Chuck Martin would move over to the offensive side of the ball as Molnar's replacement running the offense. On September 12, 2012, during the football program's 125th season, Notre Dame announced that it would leave the Big East Conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), excluding the football and hockey programs. This move became official on July 1, 2013, in time for the fall sports to compete within the ACC conference. While the Fighting Irish football team will remain an FBS independent, it has agreed to play five games per season against ACC teams starting with the 2014 football season, as the schedule allows. In return, Notre Dame will become eligible to participate in the ACC's sub-BCS level bowl arrangements. On November 18, 2012, Notre Dame was ranked No. 1 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' polls after reaching 11‚Äì0 during the regular season for the first time since 1993, also ranking No. 1 in the BCS standings for the first time in the 14-year history of the selection system. After defeating the University of Southern California Trojans on November 24, 2012, Notre Dame concluded its first 12‚Äì0 regular season, and on December 2, 2012, the Irish were formally named to appear in the BCS National Championship Game for the first time in the 2013 BCS National Championship Game. In that game, on January 7, 2013, the Irish lost to Alabama 42‚Äì14. Coming off the previous year's national title game appearance, the Fighting Irish were dealt a blow when 2012 starting quarterback, Everett Golson, was suspended from the University due to an academic violation. Senior Tommy Rees then took over. Notre Dame's 2013 season ended with a record of 9‚Äì4 and a victory over Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl. Notre Dame finished No. 20 in the AP poll. After the 2013 season, offensive coordinator Chuck Martin left ND to accept the head coaching position at Miami (OH), marking the second assistant coach to leave Kelly's staff to accept an FBS head coaching job. Mike Denbrock was promoted from wide receivers coach to offensive coordinator to replace Martin. The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida. FSU won that game 31‚Äì27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last second Notre Dame touchdown. The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8‚Äì5 record. After the 2014 season, the Irish again changed offensive coordinators, as Mike Denbrock stepped down from the position due to prostate cancer and returned to coaching the team's receivers. The 2015 Fighting Irish began its season with another new offensive coordinator, Mike Sanford Jr. That year's squad is arguably the most explosive offense that Brian Kelly has coached at Notre Dame. During the regular season, the Irish were one of twenty-one schools in the country to average 200 or more passing yards and rushing yards per game. The Irish had fourteen plays of over 50 yards during the season, which ranked 13th in the country and was a school record. They also had two touchdowns of over 90 yards, (a 91-yard touchdown run by C. J. Prosise and a 98-yard touchdown run by Josh Adams). The Irish only had two in the previous 126 years of Notre Dame football. The running game was dominant. The 5.76 yards per carry were fifth in the country. They finished the regular season averaging 34 points per game, including a 62-point effort against UMass, the most points in a game since 1996. The Irish finished their 2015 season with a 10‚Äì3 record, a ranking of #11 in the AP and #12 in the Coaches' Poll and a Fiesta Bowl appearance, a loss to Ohio State. The 2016 season ended with a 4‚Äì8 record, Brian Kelly's worst win/loss record at Notre Dame up to that point. The tone for the season was set early, with a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Texas in the season opener. On September 24, Notre Dame lost to Duke by a score of 38‚Äì35. Just 4 games into the season, Brian Kelly fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder. Mike Elko was hired from Wake Forest as VanGorder's replacement. After a sloppy 10‚Äì3 loss to NC State in Raleigh, North Carolina during messy conditions due to Hurricane Matthew, Kelly publicly called out his starting center over \\"poor snapping and atrocious play\\". At the end of the season, starting quarterback DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL Draft and backup quarterback Malik Zaire announced he would be transferring in the winter after graduation. Offensive coordinator Mike Sanford Jr. left the ND staff after the season to accept the head coaching position at Western Kentucky, making him the third Irish OC under Kelly to accept an FBS head coaching position. Chip Long was hired from Memphis as his replacement. Mike Denbrock also departed the Notre Dame staff, accepting the offensive coordinator position at Cincinnati under new head coach Luke Fickell. Amidst speculation that Kelly's job was in jeopardy and that Kelly was looking to leave Notre Dame, athletics director Jack Swarbrick announced that Kelly would return for the 2017 season. The 2017 season ended with a 10-3 record, and a win in the Citrus Bowl over LSU. On the surface, this was one of Kelly's strongest seasons at ND. An early one-point loss to #2 Georgia set the tone for the first half of the season. The tough running of running back Josh Adams behind an experienced and talented offensive line allowed Notre Dame to string together 6 consecutive 20+ point victories against solid competition like #11 USC and #14 NC State. But it all came crashing down when #3 Notre Dame visited #7 Miami in South Florida on Nov 7, 2017. An embarrassing 41-8 loss effectively ended the Irish hopes of a playoff run. They went on to struggle in final games to Navy (W 24-17) and Stanford (L 20-38). The strong start and disappointing finish made for mixed feeling among Irish fans after a horrific 2016 season.

Its construction was planned following major floods of the Seine, namely that of 1910. The lake- reservoir was declared of public utility by a decree of the September 8, 1929. Work only actually began on September 29, 1937, but was interrupted at the start of WWII, before resuming in May 1946 and completed in December 1949. During periods of high activity, up to 550 workers worked on the site (they were housed in a newly constructed workers' town, as the area has low population and most workers came from afar, without housing). Its construction also included the creation of 16 km of roads and 6 bridges. Two hamlets were engulfed during the impoundment of the reservoir: \\"Pelus\\" (entirely) and \\"Blaisy\\" (partially).

He founded India's National Botanical Research Institute and was instrumental in organizing the country's modern scientific infrastructure. He is regarded as a vital influence behind his niece Indira Gandhi's proactive role in environmental protection by means of extensive legislative and policy interventions. Notable achievements Having served as the first Indian scientist at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and worked with the Natural History Museum, London, and several British universities including the University of Cambridge, Professor Kaul established the National Botanical Research Institute (formerly, the National Botanic Gardens of India), at Lucknow in 1948. He directed the Institute until 1965, during which time it remained one of the world's five best botanical gardens, along with those at Kew (UK), Bogor (Indonesia), Paris (France) and New York (USA). From 1953 until 1965, Kaul surveyed botanically the whole of India, from the Karakoram mountains in the north to Kanyakumari at the southern tip of the country, and from the North East Frontier Agency in the east to the Rann of Kutch in the west. In the same period, he contributed to the development of the botanical gardens at Peradeniya (Sri Lanka), Singapore, Bogor (Indonesia), Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Tokyo (Japan), and Manila (Philippines). He represented India at the International Botanical Congresses at Paris (1954), Montreal (1959), and Edinburgh (1964). In 1968, he was elected as the President of the Palaeobotanical Society, India. In 1975, he was appointed the first Vice Chancellor of the Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology, Kanpur, India. Kaul's 1929 work on the medicinal plant Artemisia brevifolia in Kashmir caused yields of Santonin, an anthelminthic derived from the plant, to increase six times. This made the production of Santonin economically viable in India. In 1947, Kaul discovered fresh water aquifers in the princely state of Jodhpur in the Thar Desert, India, mainly by studying the spatial patterns of vegetation and depths of wells in the region. He used a small aircraft owned by Maharaja Umaid Singh to conduct aerial surveys for this purpose. He then prepared a Desert Reclamation Scheme to solve the enigma of Jodhpur's water shortage. In 1949-50, he also organized the Underground Water Board for Rajasthan at Jaipur. In 1969, Kaul, a native of Kashmir, was appointed Director for Gardens, Parks and Floriculture in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. He worked for several years on the conservation and management of floral biodiversity and the rejuvenation of the Mogul-era gardens in the state, and as the advisor to the Chief Minister on the subject. Kaul was responsible for the reclamation of several thousand acres of alkaline land in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. His work has been named The Banthra Formula after Banthra, the place where it was initiated in 1953. The project involved organic amendments and biological interventions such as the cultivation of alkali-tolerant herbaceous, shrub and tree species. Its decentralized, community-based development approach benefited subsistence and small-scale commercial farmers through the intensification and diversification of biomass production for food, fuel, fodder, fertilizers, medicines, timber, animal husbandry, aquaculture, soil amelioration, and bioaesthetics. As the architect of the Vigyan Mandir or School of Science Scheme (1948), which was later adopted by the Government of India, Kaul encouraged science education and research across the country. He also worked for the promotion of traditional sculpture, painting, and applied arts, and was elected as the President of the Lalit Kala Akademi of Uttar Pradesh in 1965. Contribution to the Indian freedom movement Kaul joined the Indian freedom movement led by Gandhi in 1930, when he was sent by the All India Congress Committee to assist Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan in organising rural uplift work in the Kohat, Bannu and Peshawar districts. He also worked in villages adjoining Delhi under the guidance of Asaf Ali during the Civil Disobedience Movement. In 1931, Kaul was arrested and charged with planting the flag of Independence and was sentenced to six months in jail. While in jail, he ran a school for 'C Class' prisoners. His thesis on alkaline (usar) soils was confiscated by the British Government for his active participation in the Indian Freedom Movement. Kaul also worked against untouchability and gave free education to Dalit children in Lucknow. His mother Rajpati Kaul and his sister Kamala Nehru were among the first few women to have participated in the Indian freedom movement. Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, on Salim Ali's choice of Kailas Nath Kaul as the botanical expert for a 1937 expedition to Afghanistan, remarked, \\"He [Kaul] is a young man, nice mannered and intelligent, but I am a little doubtful whether I can stomach two seditionists for three months all day and every day. Salim is a rank seditionist and communist; so is Kaul...\\" Family and friends Rajpati and Jawahar Mull Atal-Kaul were Kaul's parents, and Kamala Nehru, Chand Bahadur Kaul, and Swaroop Kathju were his siblings. He was married to Sheila Kaul, an educationist, social worker, and politician. Gautam Kaul, Deepa Kaul, and Vikram Kaul are their children. Kaul's paternal great grandfather, Moti Lal Atal (originally Thullal in Kashmiri), was dewan of the princely state of Jaipur, his brother-in-law, Jawaharlal Nehru ('Jawahar Bhai'), was the first prime minister of independent India, and his niece, Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi ('Indu'), was the third prime minister of India. Having spent much time with him in the Himalayas, Indira became deeply influenced by Kaul's passion for nature. Among Kaul's natural scientist friends were Frank Hawking, a British biologist and physician and Stephen Hawking's father; Sir Edward James Salisbury, a British botanist and ecologist; Ronald Melville, a British botanist; Arthur John Cronquist, an American botanist; Birbal Sahni, an Indian palaeobotanist; G.C. Mitra, an Indian botanist; Alexandr Innokentevich Tolmatchew, a Soviet botanist; Kiril Bratanov, a Bulgarian biologist; Ronald Pearson Tripp, a British palaeontologist; and Ren√© Dumont, a French agronomist. His other friends included Todor Zhivkov, former President of Bulgaria; Alfred Jules Ayer, a British philosopher, Herbert V. G√ºnther, a German philosopher and linguist, and Margaret Mee, a British botanical artist. Awards and honours *Padma Bhushan, Indian civilian honour (1977) *K.N.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.31%, is water. The CDP of Little Falls is located directly across the Presumpscot River, in the town of Gorham. U.S. Route 202 and Maine State Route 4 run north-south in a concurrency through both communities. History The Presumpscot River was an early transportation corridor to interior Maine; and provided reliable water power at Little Falls. Major William Knight was operating a sawmill at the falls in 1756. As the local forests were cleared, the sawmill was replaced by William Johnson's grist mill and a wool carding mill operated by Leonard Bacon and Lathrop Crockett. Locks were constructed around the falls to complete the Cumberland and Oxford Canal in 1832.Ward, Ernest E.

This colonization differed from the migrations of the Greek Dark Ages in that it consisted of organised direction by the originating metropolis instead of the simple movement of tribes which characterized the earlier migrations. Many colonies () that were founded in this period evolved into strong city-states and became independent of their metropolis. Reasons for colonization Illustration of an Archaic Greek ship on pottery Reasons for colonization had to do with the demographic explosion of this period, the development of the emporium, the need for a secure supply of raw materials, but also with the emerging politics of the period that drove sections of the population into exile. Population growth created a scarcity of farm land and a restriction of the ability of smallholders to farm it, which was similar in every city-state. In places with surplus population, this led to a demand for additional living space. The location of each colonial establishment was dictated by the supply of unexploited resources which would provision the metropolis, as well as the finished goods it would produce. The development of the emporium was among the more important motivations for the founding of a colony. The colonies created new markets, supplied the metropolis with significant raw materials and constituted important way stations on the long-distance trade journeys of the era. Finally, the troubled political situation in many cities, along with the establishment of tyrannical government, drove the political opposition into exile and into a search for new places of residence.  Characteristics of the colonization  The Argonautica. The myth is thought to pertain to the bold nautical expeditions of this period. The founding of the colonies was consistently an organised enterprise. The launch was organized by the metropolis, although in many cases they collaborated with other cities. The place to be colonized was selected in advance with the goal of offering business advantages, but also security from raiders. In order to create a feeling of security and confidence in relation to the new colony, the choice of place was decided according to its usefulness. The mission always included a leader nominated by the colonists. In the new cities, the colonists parceled out the land, including farms. The system of governance usually took a form reminiscent of that which prevailed in the metropolis. Timing The first founders of colonies were the Euboeans, who founded colonies at the beginning of the 8th century B.C. in Southern Italy and Chalcidice. The two most powerful states on Euboea, Chalcis and Eretria founded numerous colonies in Chalcidice, the most important of which was Olynthus, and they were the first to found colonies in Southern Italy. The first colony that they founded there was Pithecusae on the Isle of Ischia. Subsequently, they founded the colonies of Cumae, Zancle, Rhegium and Naxos. At the end of the 8th century Euboea fell into decline with the outbreak of the Lelantine War and the baton of colonial foundation was passed to other Greek cities. In the 7th century, many colonies were founded in Ionia, Southern Italy, Thrace and on the Black Sea. Other Greek colonies were founded on the coast of Gaul, on the Cyrenaica peninsula in Africa and also in Egypt. In this burst of colonial expansion cities such as Corinth, Miletus, Megara and Phocaea took the lead. Locations  Colonies in Macedonia and Thrace  Abdera in Thrace Numerous colonies were founded in the present Northern Greece, chiefly in the region of Chalcidice but also in the region of Thrace. Chalcidice was settled by Euboeans, chiefly from Chalcis, who lent their name to these colonies. The most important settlements of the Euboeans in Chalcidice were Olynthos (which colony was settled in collaboration with the Athenians), Torone, Mende, Sermyle, Aphytis and Cleonae in the peninsula of Athos. Other important colonies in Chalcidice were Acanthus , a colony which was founded by colonists from Andros and Potidaea, a colony of Corinth. Numerous other colonies were founded in the region of Thrace by the Ionians from the coast of Asia Minor. Important colonies were Maroneia, and Abdera. The Milesians also founded Abydos and Cardia on the Hellespont and Rhaedestus in Propontis. The Samians colonised the island of Samothrace, becoming the source of its name. Finally, the Parians colonized Thasos under the leadership of the oecist and father of the poet Archilochus, Testicles.  Colonies in the Ionian Sea and Illyria  The region of the Ionian Sea and that of Illyria were colonized strictly by Corinth. The Corinthians founded important overseas colonies on the sea lanes to Southern Italy and the west which succeeded in making them the foremost emporia of the western side of the Mediterranean. Important colonies of Corinth included Leucada, Astacus, Anactoreum, Actium, Ambracia, and Corcyra. The Corinthians also founded important colonies in Illyria, which evolved into important cities, Apollonia and Epidamnus was also a Greek colony in Illyria. Nymphaeum was another Greek colony in Illyria.  Magna Graecia: colonies in Southern Italy and Sicily The theatre at Syracuse The first to colonize Southern Italy were the Euboeans, who with the move to Pithecusae (on the isle of Ischia), founded a series of cities in that region. The second city that they founded was Cumae, nearly opposite Ischia. The colonists from Cumae founded Zancle in on Sicily, and nearby on the opposite coast, Rhegium. Further, the Euboeans founded Naxos, which became the base for the founding of the cities of Leontini, Tauromenion and Catania. In this effort they were accompanied by small numbers of Dorians and Ionians; the Athenians had notably refused to take part in the colonization. The strongest of the Sicilian colonies was Syracuse, an 8th- century B.C. colony of the Corinthians. Colonists of that same period from Achaea founded the cities of Sybaris and Croton in the Gulf of Taranto but also in the Metapontum in the same district. In the same area, refugees from Sparta founded Taranto which evolved into one of the most powerful cities in the area. Other Greek states that founded cities in Southern Italy were Megara, which founded Megara Hyblaea, and Selinous; Phocaea, which founded Elea; Rhodes, which founded Gela together with the Cretans and Lipari together with Cnidus, even as the Locrians founded Epizephyrean Locris. Many cities in the region became in turn metropolis for new colonies such as the Syracusans, who founded the city of Camarina in the south of Sicily; or the Zancleans, who led the founding of the colony of Himera. Likewise Naxos, which we see taking further part in the founding of many colonies while the city of Sybaris founded the colony of Poseidonia to its north. The city of Gela which was a colony of Rhodes and Crete founded its own colony, Acragas. The areas of settlement in Southern Italy became so thoroughly Hellenised that Roman writers such as Ovid and Polybius referred to the region as Magna Graecia (\\"Great Greece\\"). To this day, some of the Griko people in Southern Italy still speak Griko and Calabrian Greek, Doric Greek-influenced dialects with a substantial Latin adstrate, and worship in the Greek Byzantine Catholic Church instead of the Latin rite more usual among other Italians. In Modern Greek, Southern Italy is referred to as Kato Italia (lit. \\"Lower Italy\\") and the relict Greek dialects there as Katoitalika. Colonies on the Black Sea and Propontis The Greek colonies of the Black Sea The Greeks had at one point called the Black Sea shore \\"inhospitable\\". According to ancient sources, they eventually created 70 to 90 colonies. The colonization of the Black Sea was led by the Megarans and some of the Ionian cities such as Miletus, Phocaea and Teos. The majority of colonies in the region of the Black Sea and Propontis were founded in the 7th century B.C. In the area of Propontis, the Megarans founded the cities of Astacus in Bithynia, Chalcedonia and Byzantium in which they occupied a privileged position. Miletus founded Cyzicus and the Phocaeans Lampsacus.* On the western shore of the Black Sea region the Megarans founded the cities of Selymbria and a little later, Nesebar. A little farther north in the region of today's Romania the Milesians founded the cities of Istria and Orgame. And Miletus also founded a city on the western shore of the Black Sea, Apollonia. In the south of the Black Sea the most important colony was Sinope which according to prevailing opinion was founded by Miletus. The precise chronology of its foundation is not known at present but it appears that it was founded some time around the middle of the 7th century B.C. Sinope was founded with a series of other colonies in the Pontic region: Trebizond, Cerasus, Cytorus, Cotyora, Cromne, Pteria, Tium, et al. The most important colony founded on the southern shore of the Black Sea was likewise a Megaran foundation: Heraclea Pontica, which was founded in the 6th century B.C. On the north shore of the Black Sea Miletus was the first to start. The colonies of Miletus in this region of the Black Sea were Pontic Olbia and Panticapaeum (modern Kerch.) Later in the 6th century B.C. the Milesians founded Odessa in the region of modern Ukraine. Further north from the Danube delta the Greeks colonized an islet, modern Berezan (probably then a peninsula). That location is found at the confluence of the Bug estuary (the River Hypanis to the Ancient Greeks) and the Dneiper (the Barysthenes to the Ancient Greeks) The islet or peninsula itself was called by the ancients Barythmenis; across from this, they found the site that would be settled later as Olbia. Next to Olbia was another Greek colony which had Istria as its mother city. On the Crimean peninsula (the Greeks then called it Tauric Chersonese or \\"Peninsula of the Bulls\\") they founded likewise the cities of Sympheropolis , and Nymphaeum and Hermonassa. On the Sea of Azov (Lake Maiotis to the ancients) they founded Tanais (in Rostov), Tyritace, Myrmeceum, Cecrine and Phanagoria‚Äîthe last being a colony of the Teians. On the eastern shore, which was known in ancient times as Colchis and in which today for the greater part is in Georgia and the autonomous region of Abkhazia, the Greeks founded the cities of Phasis and Dioscouris. The latter was called Sebastopolis by the Romans and Byzantines and is known today as Sukhumi‚Äîthe ruins of the ancient and Byzantine foundations are now found principally below the waterline.  Colonies in the rest of the Mediterranean  Odysseus on the island of the Sirens. The Odyssey typifies the particulars of the age. The Iberian peninsula in 300 BC. Phoenician cities in blue, Greek cities in red. The Greek colonies expanded as far as the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. In North Africa, on the peninsula of Cyrenaica, colonists from Thera founded Cyrene, which evolved into a very powerful city in the region. Other colonies in Cyrenaica later included Barca, Euesperides (modern Benghazi), Taucheira, and Apollonia. On the north side of the Mediterranean the Phocaeans founded Massalia on the coast of Gaul. Massalia became the base for a series of further foundations farther away in the region of Spain. Phocaea also founded Alalia in Corsica and Olbia in Sardinia. The Phocaeans arrived next on the coast of the Iberian peninsula. As related by Herodotus, a local king summoned the Phocaeans to found a colony in the region and rendered meaningful aid in the fortification of the city. The Phocaeans founded Empuries in this region and later the even more distant Hemeroscopeum. By the middle of the 7th century the lone Greek colony in Egypt had been founded, Naucratis.Strabo, Geographia 17.1.18, cited in The pharaoh Psammitecus I gave a trade concession to Milesian merchants for one establishment on the banks of the Nile, founding a trading post which evolved into a prosperous city by the time of the Persian expedition to Egypt in 525 B.C.

Bowers was raised in Johnson City, Tennessee, during the Great Depression and World War II era. He graduated from Science Hill High School in 1946 and from the University of Tennessee in 1951. From there, he attended the Handy Writers Colony in Marshall, Illinois, founded by Lowney Turner Handy and her husband, Harry Handy, along with her student, the best-selling novelist James Jones. An autobiographical account of this adventure is Bowers's first major book, the memoir The Colony, published in 1971. During the 1960s, Bowers published numerous interviews and articles in major magazines, including The New York Times, Playboy, Sports Illustrated, New York, Cosmopolitan, and Harper's, some of which were collected in paperback under the title The Golden Bowers in the early 1970s. His first novel, No More Reunions (1973), about his teen years in Johnson City, was optioned for film but the movie was never made. A second novel of that period, Helene (1976), is a Lolita-like tale set in 1950s America with college-age males and a young teenage girl. In the Land of Nyx: Night and Its Inhabitants (1984), Bowers's next novel, was a study of the subculture of people who live their lives at night rather than during the daylight. Probably inspired by his father, who was night manager at the local railroad station during John's childhood, this book is difficult to classify in any standard genre, and languished somewhat after its release because bookstores and libraries did not know quite what to do with it. Turning his attention to historical examination of the Civil War, Bowers wrote Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a Soldier (1990) and Chickamauga and Chattanooga: The Battles That Doomed the Confederacy (2000), which mix fact, fiction, and anecdotes. For over two decades he has been an associate professor in the Writing Program at Columbia University. His play Remembrance of Things Present has been produced twice Off-Broadway.

Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, its 1939 film adaptation, and related books. This is a very different and cynical look at Oz as is seen in the books by L. Frank Baum or the film(s). Unlike the originals, these books are not intended for children. This Oz is beset with many social problems like the discrimination against sentient animals (called Animals in the book) and racial tensions between the various human ethnic groups in Oz. Many of the protagonists in the Wizard of Oz are presented either as antagonists or neutral. The first book in the series, Wicked, was adapted into a successful musical of the same name. The novels There are four books in the series. The first novel, published in 1995, was Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, a book detailing the life of the infamous villain from Baum's books, now called \\"Elphaba\\". It is told through the various perspectives of those who knew Elphaba (who would become branded as the Wicked Witch of the West), an outcast aspiring social reformer with an allergy to water. The novel was a huge success, and was later adapted into a smash hit musical, which opened on Broadway on October 30, 2003. A sequel, Son of a Witch, was published in 2005, and detailed the life of Elphaba's son Liir. It is told through the perspective of her son Liir who is trying to find his half-sister Nor and incidentally finishes some of Elphaba's work. It begins not long after the end of \\"Wicked.\\"Gregory Maguire, Out of Oz, Williams Morrow/Harper-Collins, 2011; p. xi. . A third novel was published in 2008, titled A Lion Among Men; the protagonist being the Cowardly Lion, now called 'Brrr'. His history from cubhood to current time of the book is given in parallel with the history of the oracle Yackle, who was introduced in \\"Wicked.\\" Their stories overlap with \\"Wicked\\" and \\"Son of Witch\\", carrying the story about eight years past \\"Son of a Witch.\\" Lion was the first book to introduce the title \\"Wicked Years\\". The fourth and final book, Out of Oz, was published in 2011. It begins immediately after the end of \\"Lion\\" and focuses on Liir's daughter Rain. The promotional info stated that the novel \\"will feature all sorts of magical mayhem, with the Emerald City plotting an attack on Munchkinland, while the Cowardly Lion runs for his life. Young Dorothy pops in for \\"something more than a cameo.\\"http://www.ology.com/arts/gregory- maguires-out-oz-hit-bookstores-november The Grimmerie The Grimmerie (a variation on the words 'Grimoire' and 'gramarye') is a fictional book of spells in The Wicked Years universe. In both the original novels and the stage adaptation, the Grimmerie is written in a language that the people of Oz cannot read; in the novels, this is because the book came from Earth and is written in English, whereas in the musical, it is said to be written in the \\"lost language of spells\\". The Grimmerie is also the title of a behind-the- scenes book about the musical, published in the year 2005 (). In the novel, the Grimmerie contains information on various supernatural creatures, including angels and an entire section on \\"Evil Particulars\\" (i.e. demons), methods of poisoning water and breeding a docile population, as well as diagrams of instruments of torture and weapons which Elphaba considers \\"too vile to use\\". It also contains: *A recipe entitled \\"Of apples with black skin and white flesh: to fill the stomach with greed unto Death\\". *A recipe to overthrow a regime, which suggests spells for various methods of sabotage and assassination. *Spells for 'unleashing the hidden energies of matter'. *Spells to tamper with time. *A spell \\"On the Administration of Dragons\\". This page plays an important part in the plot of Son of a Witch, where Shell Thropp, the Emperor Apostle, presents this page to Trism bon Cavalish. *Spells to encourage flight in originally earth-bound animals *Various 'marginalia on how to keep awake', which Elphaba combines with home remedies to produce a powerful insomnia potion *'A spell to reveal hidden inscription [...]Perhaps even the location of individuals in hiding'. The reverse side of the page on the Administration of Dragons contains the second half of this spell. * A spell entitled \\"To Call Winter on Water,\\" used by Glinda to trap war ships advancing on Munchkinland in ice, in the beginning of Out of Oz In the musical, the Grimmerie is a pivotal instrument in Elphaba's magical powers. It contains a variety of incantations, written in a strange language, that allow her to perform various spells throughout the musical; the contents are considerably less gruesome than those of its novel counterpart. Inconsistencies The series exhibits occasional continuity errors and factual inaccuracies. In Wicked, some Ozian characters wonder if Dorothy is of royal blood, because her name is a near-anagram of Theodore, the man who rules her country. In Out of Oz, it is revealed that the Kansas twister sent Dorothy to Oz in 1900, when Theodore Roosevelt was only a candidate for the Vice Presidency. His abrupt accession to the US Presidency did not occur until September 1901. In Out of Oz, Dorothy and her family purchase fortune cookies at a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco in April 1906. At the time, fortune cookies were known as fortune tea cakes and were a Japanese-Californian specialty. They were not appropriated by Chinese-Californians until the 1940s as a result of the internment years.

Background Movement Concept was created by Ingo Taleb Rashid and derives its fundamental principles from dance and theatre methods from East and West (e.g. Butoh, Noh, Stanislawski Method), martial arts (e.g. Ninpo, Capoeira) and the ancient tradition of Sufism, the spiritual principles of which are transferred into modern body work. The idea behind Movement Concept is to tap a person‚Äôs full potential, to use exhaustively the diversity of the body‚Äôs capacity for movement and expression, to make these accessible and use them for stage work and, at the same time, increases our awareness of it. An essential part of the system is ‚Äúplay‚Äù, in which two people apply the acquired technique and abilities in free improvisation inside a protective circle of participants. Three-year Ongoing Curricular Training Movement Concept is intended as a practical educational training system combining bodywork, performing arts and spirituality. It is meant for all people who want to deal more deeply with these topics ‚Äì regardless of age, experience or previous knowledge. It is also suitable as advanced training for performers in the areas of dance, directing and choreography. The Movement Concept curriculum spans three years (approx. 30 days of training each year). Before entering into training, a personal conversation with the educational director is required. The training concludes with a written assignment and a demonstration lesson. After successful completion of the curriculum, participants receive a diploma that certifies the qualification to teach Movement Concept under the supervision of El Haddawi.

Character history Dr. Benjamin Twist is a bumbling, fraudulent but lovable science teacher of the (fictional) St. Michael's School, which forms the backdrop of the films he appears in. Twist's typical appearance was with a mortarboard at an angle on his head and a pince-nez on his nose, as he squinted in a bewildered way at his unruly pupils.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/447228/credits.html Appearances Good Morning, Boys Twist's first appearance was in the 1937 film Good Morning, Boys, in which he is presented as the laid-back headmaster of St. Michael's, a boys school for the sons of rich gentry, where he also teaches Science. Initially, he turns a blind eye to the misbehaviour of the boys under his eye, and teaches the children using his method of Twisterism, which is somehow related to Astrology and the signs of the Zodiac. However, he is later ordered by the school's new governor to adopt stricter policies, eventually turning St. Michael's into a military academy, with Twist holding an officer's rank. Hey! Hey! USA! Benjamin Twist appeared again in Hay's next film, Hey! Hey! USA! (1938). In this film, however, Twist is working as a porter aboard an oceangoing liner travelling between England and the United States, and during one particular voyage, he is mistaken for a scientist known as Prof. Tavistock by American gangster Bugs Leary (Edgar Kennedy), eventually becoming embroiled in a gangster plot to blackmail an American millionaire. It is possible that Hey! Hey! USA! portrayed events that took place those before Good Morning, Boys, explaining Twist's sudden change from teacher to steward, and the absence of St. Michael's School. Convict 99 Benjamin Twist's final appearance in the Will Hay films was in the 1938 film Convict 99, which was released shortly after Hey! Hey! USA!. In this film, Twist is dismissed from St. Michaels for incompetence, and whilst attending a job interview for a position in another school, he is mistaken for Australian disciplinarian John D. Benjamin (Roy Emerton), and accidentally accepts the post of governor of Blackdown Prison in Devon (possibly based on the real-life Dartmoor Prison), where he befriends prison-warden Albert (Graham Moffatt) and inmate Jerry \\"The Mole\\" (Moore Marriott). Other appearances A precursor of the Benjamin Twist character was Dr Alec Smart in Boys Will Be Boys (1935), who was an otherwise identical teaching character. In The Ghost of St. Michael's (1941) the bumbling-teacher character has changed to William Lamb, but the character still bears similarities in appearance and manner to Benjamin Twist.

It is supplied mainly by the River Cure, and is situated at the heart of the Morvan Regional Natural Park, in Ni√®vre. The lake is found south of the town Montsauche-les-Settons. It is one of the Great Lakes of the Morvan.  General overview  The reservoir, whose perimeter exceeds , has an average depth of and is situated at an altitude of . It was formed between 1854 to 1861 by a high granite dam. The reservoir was intended to regulate traffic on the Yonne River and help allow timber rafting to Paris.  History   Construction  The first surveys date back to the time of Louis XVI, but these were never completed. They were restarted under the command of Andr√© Dupin. On 15 July 1854, the work was contracted to Perrichon, an entrepreneur from Nevers. Meanwhile, the execution of the work was carried out by Cambuzat, Lepeuple and Otry of Labrit. The construction of the dam was started in 1854 and finished in 1858. The dam was constructed from granite rocks, hauled by cattle from the Breuil-Chenue forest, which was away from the lake. To get the granite, they pushed north to the heights of the Ponceaux, and south to those of the Outre- Cure. The dam was dedicated on 13 May 1858 by the future Bishop of Troyes, Pierre-Louis-Marie Cortet. Several buildings were submerged, notably windmills that can still be seen every decade or so, when the reservoir is emptied. In 1861, the new construction was required to repair water damage. Around 1920, the lake lost its main function since timber was no longer rafted to Paris due to wood's replacement by coal as a fuel source. The lake was then abandoned for several decades. The dam became a listed site in 1937. The lake then became popular leisure destination. In 1956 the first camping site opened for business, whilst the hotels increased in number.

Background Four-and-Twenty was bred and raced by the Alberta Ranches, Ltd. partnership of Max Bell, Frank McMahon and superstar jockey Johnny Longden and his son, Vance. He was sired by a son of the two-time Leading sire in North America, Princequillo. His dam was Sixpence, a good runner in England and Ireland voted the 1953 British Champion Two-Year-Old Filly. Four-and-Twenty's name came from a line in the nursery rhyme featuring the name used by his dam titled Sing a Song of Sixpence. Racing career Four-and-Twenty was ridden by Johnny Longden and trained by his son, Vance. In his three-year-old season in 1961, the colt won California's most important race for his age group, the one and one-eighth-mile Santa Anita Derby. He was then sent to Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky where he suffered the first loss of his career when he finished second to Crozier in the Derby Trial Stakes. Remaining at Churchill downs, Four-and-Twenty was entered in the first leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the one and one-quarter-mile Kentucky Derby. On race day he was sent off as the third choice among bettors behind favorite Carry Back and second choice, Crozier. In the race, Four-and-Twenty moved into the lead as the field headed for the homestretch but found the extra one-eighth of a mile too much and quickly faded in midstretch. He wound up in seventh place behind winner, Carry Back. The colt rebounded to win important races in 1961 such as the Hollywood Derby. Competing at age four in California in races at a mile and an eight or less, Four-and-Twenty won a number of important events including the 1962 Santa Anita Maturity, San Carlos Handicap, San Fernando Stakes, and the San Bernardino Handicap. He returned to racing at age five, winning the Tropicana Hotel of Las Vegas Handicap at Bay Meadows Racetrack in San Mateo, California. Stud record Retired to stud, Four-and-Twenty's offspring met with modest success in racing. Among his progeny was the multiple stakes winner, Haveago, whose wins included the 1971 Bing Crosby Handicap.

Mount Gilmour as seen from an aerial view photograph on p31 of Proceedings, American Philosophical Society (vol. 89, 1945) In February 1940, shortly after West Base was set up in Little America III, Dr. Paul Siple directed an airplane flight from the West Base to the Edsel Ford Ranges to determine where exploration and geological work was to be done during the next summer season, and numerous aerial photographs were taken. During the long winter months that followed, fairly accurate maps were made of the Southern Edsel Ford Ranges. This is an area of approximately of mountainous coastland in the northwestern region of Marie Byrd Land. During the 1940 winter night, a Geological Party Expedition of four explorers was organized and they prepared for the extremely long trek on two dog sleds to the Edsel Ford Ranges. The four-man party was composed of Lawrence A. Warner, leader and geologist, Charles F. Passel, geologist and radio operator, Harold P.

The four-man Geological Party Expedition left the West Base on October 17, 1940 to explore and record the territory and returned 82 days later on January 7, 1941 traveling a total of on board their dog sleds. In the nearly three-month expedition, they had to be supported by airplanes that deposited supplies at intervals along their charted route. The Geological Party Expedition visited for the first time some 50 peaks in this region and some 300 geological specimens were collected. Mount Gilmour was one of those peaks.Proceedings, American Philosophical Society (vol. 89, 1945), \\"Reports on Scientific Results of the United States Antarctic Service Expedition, 1939-1941\\"Ice: The Antarctic Diary of Charles F.

It was established in 1916 as the South Suburban College, under the stewardship of educationist Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, who was the then vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta. After the death of Sir Mukherjee, the college was renamed as Asutosh College in 1924. The principal of the college is Dr. Dipak Kumar Kar. It is affiliated to the Calcutta University . The first college in West Bengal to be accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council in 2002, it was given an A grade with a CGPA score of 3.22 in 2016, helping it secure its position among the top four affiliated colleges of West Bengal. History Sir Asutosh Mukherjee The college shifted to its current location in 1935. The present college building has a premise of forty thousand square feet and more than fifty classrooms which can contain about 4000 students. Twenty-eight subjects are taught as Honors/Major/Vocational at the Undergraduate level. In the year 2002, a post graduation course in Environmental Science was introduced. Post graduate courses in Applied Geology, Bengali, Computer Science, Information Science, Geography, Zoology were introduced in between 2009 and 2014. In 2013, add-on courses in Hospital waste disposal management, Industrial Chemistry and Travel & Tourism were introduced. In 2012, the Mother Teresa International Award was conferred on Asutosh College for outstanding achievement and contribution in the field of Best College of the Year. In 2014, University Grants Commission-approved free add-on courses on Tourism, Industrial Chemistry, and Hospital Waste Disposal Management were introduced by the college. Campuses A Second Campus of Asutosh College was planned in 2003. The Centenary Building of the college was inaugurated by the erstwhile President of India, Pranab Mukherjee on 1 April 2015. Asutosh college is the 12th college in Kolkata that was first to set up rooftop solar plant to produce 20 kW for its own use. College of Choice The college is an institution of choice for many students in Kolkata and the wider state for subjects in the liberal arts and science. While the English, Bengali, History and Statistics departments of the college are staffed by some of the most senior academic faculty in the city, the upgradation of laboratory infrastructure has focused attention on the science stream in recent years. The Geography, Physics, Zoology, Microbiology and chemistry departments have remained special draws for under graduation students. The Mass Communication department and Communicative English Department has also seen applications rising.Each year the college has UDAAN celebration which has become quite popular for showcasing youth talent. However, this has continued to exacerbate the major imbalance in student to teacher ratio, in Honours classes as well as those for Pass subjects. This problem had been pointed out by NAAC in its very first review of the college in 2004. \\"In the big urban colleges, like that of Asutosh, the teacher-taught ratio needs to be much more balanced. Universities and educational administrators of the state need to think of a way out of this huge imbalance in the classroom, as this may throw normal teaching-learning out of gear.\\" NAAC Accreditation In 2015, the Government of West Bengal offered a financial incentive of up to Rs. 2 crore each, to colleges with NAAC grading of A or B. The Department of Higher Education wanted institutions like Asutosh College with a proven academic track record of renewing their NAAC grade. But many colleges, including Asutosh, was reluctant to get involved in the process which the Principal at the time called \\"long drawn and fund consuming, without having any real benefit\\". While the college was rated C++ in its inaugural assessment back in 2002, it did not apply in 2007 when the rating expired. It has since applied for certification and now has an A grade rating by the NAAC. Facilities The college has a separate counselling cell for both victims of ragging as well as possible aggressors, as part of an anti-ragging initiative. All the departments have their own libraries and well-organized laboratories for Science departments. In the news In 1996, then Principal Subhankar Chakraborty was accused of moral policing after he asked female students to dress modestly. In early 2018, sanitary pad dispensers, installed in the college back in 2015 were found to be not working. Many female students did not know about the machines while others felt self-conscious to use the machines which were placed in corridors and other public parts of the campus. However, the college alleged the quality of pads were so low that students gave them a miss. They also said the after sales service of the company roped in by the state government to install and operate the machines, were unpredictable and bad.

Life Reed was educated at Dulwich College and Jesus College, Oxford, obtaining a degree in Literae Humaniores in 1933 and a diploma in education in 1934. Whilst still at Oxford, he won a composition prize for a sonata for violin and piano, and Sir Hugh Allen (Professor of Music at Oxford) recommended that he should study at the Royal College of Music. Reed studied composition with Herbert Howells and conducting with Constant Lambert. He travelled to Scandinavia on a scholarship in 1936, meeting the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius, and lectured in Scandinavia on behalf of the British Council in 1936 and 1937. In 1939, he obtained a D Mus degree from the University of Oxford. From his time at Oxford onwards, he was a member of the Oxford Group (which later became Moral Re- Armament), an international moral and spiritual movement. He wrote reviews for the group during the Second World War, and travelled and composed extensively for them between 1940 and 1960. He became Director of Music at Westminster Theatre Arts Centre in 1966, the group's London venue, and ran a series of successful concerts there. He was a lecturer for the Workers' Educational Association from 1973 to 1997. He died on 15 April 2002.

It is located in the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, France.  Geography  The √âtang du Lanoux is located entirely on the commune of Angoustrine-Villeneuve-des- Escaldes.  History  Henry Russell is known to have made the first ascent of the Pic Carlit in 1864, where he was fascinated by the beautiful view of the √âtang du Lanoux, which can be seen from the top.  Lake Lanoux Arbitration 1957 (France v Spain)  This arbitration concerned the use of the waters of Lake Lanoux, in the Pyrenees. The French Government proposed to carry out certain works for the utilization of the waters of the lake and the Spanish Government feared that these works would adversely affect Spanish rights and interests, contrary to the Treaty of Bayonne of May 26, 1866, between France and Spain and the Additional Act of the same date. In any event, it was claimed that, under the Treaty, such works could not be undertaken without the previous agreement of both parties. Lake Lanoux lies on the southern slopes of the Pyrenees, on French territory. It is fed by streams which have their source in French territory and which run entirely through French territory only. Its waters emerge only by the Font-Vive stream, which forms one of the headwaters of the River Carol. That river, after flowing approximately 25 kilometer?s from Lake Lanoux through French territory, crosses the Spanish frontier at Puigcerda and continues to flow through Spain for about 6 kilometers before joining the river Segre, which ultimately flows into the Ebro. Before entering Spanish territory, the waters of the Carol feed the Canal of Puigcerda which is the private property of that town. On September 21, 1950, Electricit√© de France applied to the French Ministry for Industry for a concession, based on a scheme involving the diversion of the waters of Lake Lanoux towards the River Ari√®ge. The waters so diverted were to be completely returned into the River Carol by means of a tunnel leading from the upper courses of the Ari√®ge at a point on the Carol above the outlet to the Puigcerda Canal. The French Government, however, while accepting the principle that waters drawn off should be returned, regarded itself as bound only to return a quantity of water corresponding to the actual needs of the Spanish users. Consequently, France was going to proceed to develop Lake Lanoux by diverting its waters towards the Ariege but a certain limited flow of water corresponding to the actual needs of the Spanish frontagers would be assured at the level of the outlet to the Puigcerda Canal. Spain was opposed to any diversion of the waters of Lake Lanoux. The Tribunal examined the Treaty of Bayonne of May 26, 1866 and the Additional Act, as well as the arguments brought forward by both Governments. Regarding the question whether France had taken Spanish interests into sufficient consideration, the Tribunal stressed that in determining the manner in which a scheme had taken into consideration the interests involved, the way in which negotiations had developed, the total number of the interests which had been presented, the price which each Party had been ready to pay to have those interests safeguarded, were all essential factors in establishing, with regard to the obligations set out in Article 11 of the Additional Act, the merits of that scheme. In conclusion, the Tribunal was of opinion that the French scheme complied with the obligations of Article 11 of the Additional Act. The Tribunal decided that in carrying out, without prior agreement between the two Governments, works for the utilization of the waters of Lake Lanoux in the conditions mentioned in the Scheme for the Utilization of the Waters of Lake Lanoux, the French Government was not committing a breach of the provisions of the Treaty of Bayonne of May 26, 1866, and the Additional Act of the same date.\\"http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XII/281-317_Lanoux.pdf  References  Lanoux ","title":"√âtang du Lanoux"},{"id":"21608843","text":"Lac de Vaivre is an artificial lake in Vaivre-et-Montoille, in Haute-Sa√¥ne, France.

The hotel is located on North Bridge between the Royal Mile and Princes Street, thereby straddling Edinburgh‚Äôs Medieval Old Town and Georgian New Town.  Ownership  The Scotsman was previously part of JJW Hotels & Resorts and was purchased by Sheikh M.B.I Al Jaber for ¬£63 million in 2006. In August 2007, JJW acquired The Eton Collection. The hotel went into liquidation in June 2016 and was sold to the G1 Group for an undisclosed amount in February 2017.  Building history  In the 1900s the North Bridge running between the New and Old Towns of Edinburgh was widened and as part of this expansion a 190 foot high tower was built, into which The Scotsman newspaper moved their offices. The building cost around ¬£500,000 and after the rest of the North Bridge extension was completed teamed with the Carlton directly opposite, it formed an imposing entrance to the Old Town. The direct access from Market Street to the building was an ideal distribution outlet for the papers to be packed directly onto the trains at Edinburgh Waverley railway station straight from the printing house that took up the entire basement. The middle floors of the building were originally used for the editorial offices. The current penthouse used to be the Pigeon lofts. The site now occupied by the North Bridge Brasserie originally held the reception and trading rooms where bartering over advertising took place. In 2001 the Newspaper moved to their own purpose built offices in Holyrood and the building was renovated into The Scotsman Hotel. In 2017, the hotel once again came under Scottish ownership when it was purchased by G1 Group, one of the countries largest hospitality groups.

Early life He was born Tadd√©e Choquette in St. Benoit de Mirabel (Deux-Montagnes) in a farming family. His parents were Julien Choquette and Magdeleine Rastoul. His father was a farmer and also a lieutenant in the loyal militia of St. Eustache who took part in the Battle of St. EustacheThe Battle of St. Eustache against the Patriotes (December 1837). His two cousins, Damien Masson and Luc-Hyacinthe Masson, where well known Patriotes. His uncle Basile Choquette was also a captain in the loyal militia of St. Eustache, directed by Maximilien Globensky. Choquette left home on foot in 1849 at the age of 19 and set out first for work in Montreal, then traveled via Duluth, Minnesota, to Independence, Missouri, where he joined one of the many wagon trains bound for the California Gold Rush. Arriving too late to stake a claim, Choquette found work as a mucker or panner. He worked his way north through the Shasta diggings, and then the Trinity, Scott and Klamath Rivers, reaching the Oregon Territory and making it to the Fraser goldfields in 1858.Alaska History, Ice Mountain Research website Failing to find his own strike there, in 1859 and 1860, he prospected a while on the remote Nass River and other rivers north of that without much success. Gold discovery Then, on a trip to Victoria, he encountered a group of Stikine Indians, who were a subgroup of the Tlingit; suspecting the Stikine and rivers farther north were richer in gold the further one went north, he persuaded them to let him ride in their canoes to Fort Stikine (today's Wrangell, Alaska), in what was then still Russian America. No longer a Hudson's Bay Company post, the former fur post was under the control of the powerful Chief Shakes, and had become known as Shakesville. Shake's daughter Georgiana became Choquette's wife, a great honour in prestige-conscious Tlingit society. With his wife and ten men of the Stikine people, and the chief's blessing, Choquette traveled up the Stikine River, whose mouth is near Wrangell, and found gold at a location near Telegraph Creek, about up that river, at a place marked on the map today as Buck Bar. News of his strike reached Victoria and thousands of men traveled via the Stikine and overland via another route up the Skeena River, by what became Hazelton. Choquette's own claim was not that profitable, but he opened a trading post near his claim, moving it from time to time over the years. His main post was farther down river, near the Great Glacier, at a location known as Choquette Bar today, near Choquette Hot Springs Provincial Park, and was also known as Ice Mountain, which was the name of one of the dominant peaks at that location. By 1867, Choquette and his wife were living in Shakesville, where he had operated a post for the Hudson's Bay Company, whose goods he also sold at his upriver stores. When the Alaska Purchase of that year saw control of the Alaska Panhandle transferred to the United States, Choquette chose to move upriver to his main store on the Stikine, which was at the confluence of the Stikine and Anuk Rivers. He had some disputes with the Hudson's Bay Company, and opened up his own store independent of their interests,Alexander Buck Choquette, Choqet(te) family website but preferred to trade in British territory to avoid American taxes and having to buy American goods. Choquette spoke both Tlingit and the Chinook Jargon and was invaluable in intercommunal relations and commerce to all parties acquainted with him As business on the river's diggings began to slow, Choquette opened a salmon saltery and in 1886 traveled via one of the first transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway to testify at hearings in Ottawa concerning the location of the boundary between Alaska and British Columbia. Later years After the passing of his wife, with whom he had had many children, at the age of 70 Choquette struck out again for newer goldfields still farther north, opening a store in the Klondike. He died in the hospital in Dawson City in June 1898. Among his last visitors was the novelist Jack London, who had asked to meet an authentic prospector. Legacy In addition to the Choquette River, other places named after him are: its source the Choquette Glacier, and Choquette Hot Springs Provincial Park (the springs themselves are the Stikine Hot Springs), and Buck Bar and also Buck Riffle near Telegraph Creek, another bar on the lower Stikine, Choquette Bar, which also was known as Buck's Bar like its upstream counterpart (as were other locations where he had at times had his store).Alaska History, Ice Mountain Research webpage Mount Johnny, to the southeast of Choquette Bar, was named for his son, a trapper and miner on the Iskut River, who died in the 1930s. Many of Choquette's descendants by Georgiana still live in Wrangell to this day.

Construction of the MDD was completed in late 1976. It was first used during mate-demate operations with the prototype Space Shuttle Enterprise during the five Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) in 1977. It was then used for post-landing and Shuttle Carrier Aircraft mating operations at NASA Armstrong following shuttle orbital missions that landed at Edwards. Fifty-four of the 135 shuttle missions landed at Edwards between STS-1 in 1981 through STS-128 in 2009. All but one of the other flights, which landed at White Sands in New Mexico (STS-3), landed at Kennedy Space Center instead. This MDD was used to hoist a Space Shuttle orbiter onto a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the flight back to Florida. The MDD was dismantled in 2014 following the retirement of Space Shuttle.

It was the first Doctor Who spin-off to produce a special for Comic Relief and was broadcast on 13 March 2009 as part of Red Nose Day 2009. Plot Sarah Jane, Luke, Clyde and Rani are talking to Mr Smith when suddenly there is a breach in the attic. Mr Smith identifies the disturbance as a teleport and a diplomat named Ranius (played by comedian Ronnie Corbett) appears. He states that he represents the Galactic Alliance and gives them all gifts for defending the Earth so valiantly. He then pulls up a chair to talk to them and experiences apparent flatulence. Sarah Jane, Clyde, Rani and Luke all notice the similarity of the constant flatulence with that of a Slitheen wearing a skin suit, which Ranius denies quite strongly. K9 materialises and confirms Mr Smith's identification, but Ranius states all dogs should be put on a lead and clamps K9. After further interrogation, Ranius immobilises Sarah Jane's, Luke's, Clyde's and Rani's feet using the gifts he had given them and reveals himself to be a Slitheen after all, unzipping his forehead to reveal a diminutive Raxacoricofallapatorian and stating his plan to steal K9 and the information it contains. Thinking swiftly, Sarah Jane manages to use her sonic lipstick to release their feet clamps and clamp Ranius' feet. Clyde then throws Ranius' bowler hat at a switch on Mr Smith, teleporting Ranius away and releasing the clamp on K9. Outside references The script includes several references to The Two Ronnies. Corbett's character name, Rani, is a pun on Ronnie, highlighted when he claims that he and Sarah's human friend Rani Chandra could be classed as \\"The Two Ranis\\". The story Ambassador Rani tells is also a reference to The Two Ronnies - both the visual of Corbett sitting in the chair and his mention of \\"Fork Handles\\" (or Four Candles). Finally, at the end of the scene, Sarah Jane utters Ronnie Barker's catchphrase \\"...and it's goodnight from him\\". The scene also makes two references to Red Nose Day. The gifts bestowed on Sarah and her friends are Comic Relief deely boppers, and the final shot of the scene is K-9 sporting a Red Nose.

The project was privately funded and the prototype design was done in the spare time of the company's engineers. This all happened during 1926, with high-speed performance as the primary goal. Design and development Development of the aircraft later known as the Westland Wizard began in 1925, when some of the company's engineers drew up, in their spare time, the design for a single seat racing aircraft, the Westland Racer. This was a parasol monoplane, of mixed construction, with a Duralumin and steel- tube forward fuselage covered with metal and fabric skinning, a wood and fabric rear fuselage and a wooden wing. The Westland Widgeon, also a monoplane, had influenced the designers in their choice of wing arrangement. After receiving permission from Westland's management, a prototype was constructed, powered by a surplus 275 hp (205 kW) Rolls-Royce Falcon III engine salvaged from the prototype Westland Limousine transport after the Limousine was wrecked in a taxying accident.James 1991, pp. 126‚Äì127. The Racer made its maiden flight in the spring of 1926.Mason 1992, pp. 180‚Äì181. Later that year, however, it was badly damaged in an emergency landing at Westland's Yeovil factory. It was decided to rebuild the aircraft as a fighter, with a new, all-metal, fuselage. The Falcon was replaced by one of Rolls-Royce's new F.XI (later known as the Kestrel engines giving 490 hp (366 kW) in a more streamlined nose, while two Vickers machine guns were mounted semi-externally in the fuselage sides. It retained the wooden parasol wing of the Racer, which was mounted close to the fuselage on tandem pylons on the fuselage centreline.James 1991, pp. 128‚Äì129.Flight 1 November 1928, p. 948. The undercarriage was of tailwheel type, while the thick section wing allowed the aircraft's fuel tanks to be buried in the wing, saving space in the fuselage while keeping wing drag low, also allowing a gravity feed to the engine and reducing fire risks. The cockpit was more or less in line with the trailing edge of the wing. The seat was of such a height that the pilot's eyes were in the neighbourhood of being level with the wing. This enabled him to look either over or under the wing. The height of the seat was adjustable on the ground, and the rudder bar could be set up for two positions to suit different pilots.Flight 1 November 1928, p. 949. The rebuilt aircraft, now known as the Wizard, flew in November 1927.James 1991, p. 129. The Wizard was fast and had impressive climb performance, and was tested by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) at RAF Martlesham Heath from the end of January 1928. While the A&AEEs; test pilots praised the Wizard's performance, they criticised the pilot's forward view and considered the aileron control loads too heavy.James 1991, p. 130. During the summer of 1928, the Wizard made its first public appearance at the Royal Air Force Display at Hendon, among the other new single-seater fighters. The Wizard attracted a great deal of attention, mainly because of its clean lines and generally attractive appearance, as well as its unusual layout. (Parasol monoplane designs has not been in service with the Royal Air Force since the days of the First World War, when a number of Morane-Saulnier's were used. Since then the RAF had used biplanes or at most sesquiplanes for its fighters). The Air Ministry remained interested in the Wizard and gave Westland a contract to further develop the Wizard. It was fitted with a new, all-metal wing of increased span and reduced chord. In order to improve the view for the pilot, the wing was fitted with a much thinner centre section and was mounted on more conventional cabane strutting. It had new inset ailerons. The engine was also replaced by a supercharged 500 hp (373 kW) Rolls-Royce F.XIS. In this form it was known as the Wizard II. The Wizard II had lower performance than the earlier version, and did not impress the Air Ministry sufficiently for it to override its long standing preference for biplane fighters.

The $100,000 infield helped the Athletics win four American League championships in five years‚Äî, , and ‚Äîand win the World Series in 1910, 1911 and 1913. The group was broken up after losing the 1914 World Series as a result of the financial pressures resulting from the emergence of the Federal League. Two members‚ÄîCollins and Baker‚Äîhave been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Eddie Collins Collins was the first member of the $100,000 infield to join the Athletics. He debuted on September 17, 1906, after playing college ball at Columbia University. In 1906 and 1907, he played 20 games for the Athletics, mostly at shortstop. In 1908, he took over as the Athletics' regular second baseman, replacing Danny Murphy, who moved to the outfield. During the $100,000 infield years from 1910 to 1914, he played 738 games, getting 922 hits in 2,677 at bats for a batting average of .344. He led the American League in runs in 1912, 1913 and 1914, stolen bases in 1910, singles in 1913 and times on base in 1914. He also finished in the top ten in the American League in batting average, on-base percentage, hits, stolen bases, singles and times on base every year from 1910 through 1914. In addition, he finished in the top ten in American Most Valuable Player voting every year from 1911 through 1914, winning the Most Valuable Player award in 1914. He was sold to the Chicago White Sox after the 1914 season as Athletics' manager Connie Mack attempted to respond to the financial pressures brought on by the newly formed Federal League, breaking up the $100,000 infield. He returned to Mack and the Athletics in 1927, finishing his career playing 12 games for the Athletics in their 1929 and 1930 World Championship seasons. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1939. Jack Barry Jack Barry, $100,000 infield shortstop Barry was the next to join the Athletics, debuting on July 13, 1908, after playing for the College of the Holy Cross. Between 1910 and 1914, Barry played 686 games for the Athletics, getting 607 hits in 2,334 at bats for a batting average of .260. He finished in the American League top ten in sacrifice hits every year from 1911 through 1914, and ranked fifth in the American League in runs batted in in 1913. But his primary contributions were on defense, where he had a strong arm, enormous range and sure hands, and was able to work out innovative plays with his good friend Collins, such as a defense against the double steal. He finished in the top 20 in Most Valuable Player voting every year from 1911 through 1914, with his best showing a ninth-place finish in 1913. He was sold to the Boston Red Sox in the middle of the 1915 season, where he moved to second base and played on the Red Sox' 1915 and 1916 World Championship teams. He missed the Red Sox 1918 Championship season due to service in the U.S. Navy. Frank \\"Home Run\\" Baker Frank Baker, the $100,000 infield's third baseman Baker also joined the Athletics in 1908, debuting on September 21. He became the Athletics regular third baseman in 1909, and led the American League in triples that season. Between 1910 and 1914, Baker played 742 games for the Athletics, getting 929 hits in 2,864 at bats for a batting average of .324. He led the American League in home runs every year from 1911 through 1914, and led the league in runs batted in during 1912 and 1913. He also finished in the top ten in batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and times on base every year from 1911 through 1914, and finished in the top ten in runs scored, hits, doubles, total bases, extra base hits and runs batted in every year from 1910 through 1914. He finished in the top ten in the American League Most Valuable Player voting every year from 1911 through 1914, finishing third in 1914, his highest showing. Baker was the hero of the 1911 World Series, hitting two home runs to help the Athletics win the series, which earned him the nickname \\"Home Run\\" Baker. Baker held out the 1915 season when manager and owner Connie Mack refused to increase his salary, and was sold to the New York Yankees in 1916 after American League president Ban Johnson intervened. He finished his career as the third baseman for the Yankees pennant-winning teams in 1921 and 1922. Baker was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1955. Stuffy McInnis First baseman Stuffy McInnis McInnis was the final member of the $100,000 infield to join. He started his career as an 18-year-old little-used backup infielder for the Athletics in 1909, and played a little more in 1910. In 1909 and 1910, he played more games backing up Barry at shortstop than at any other position. Before the 1911 season, Mack decided to make McInnis his regular first baseman, replacing the popular veteran Harry Davis, although McInnis did have to begin the season as the Athletics' shortstop when Barry became ill before taking over at first base. Defensively as a first baseman, he was known for having exceptional reach. Between 1910 and 1914, McInnis played 614 games for the Athletics, getting 715 hits in 2,228 at bats for a batting average of .321. He led the American League in singles in 1914, and finished in the top ten in batting average, hits, total bases, runs batted in and singles every year from 1912 through 1914. In both 1912 and 1913, he also finished in the top ten in slugging percentage and on-base percentage. He received Most Valuable Player votes every season from 1911 through 1914, finishing seventh in both 1913 and 1914. McInnis is the only member of the $100,000 infield to remain with the Athletics beyond 1915. He was eventually traded to the Boston Red Sox in 1918 in exchange for Larry Gardner, Hick Cady and Tilly Walker, where he played on Boston's 1918 World Championship team. He also reteamed with Barry on the 1919 Boston Red Sox. Before finishing his career in 1927 he also played with the Cleveland Indians, Boston Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies.

It is the last of five reservoirs established on the Verdon since 1963; of these, the lake of Esparron is the third largest by surface area after the lakes of Sainte-Croix and Castillon. Its creation flooded the entire plain that overlooked Esparron-de-Verdon, and raised the level of the river for 8 km upstream from the lake. This had the consequence of cutting the old road leading to Saint-Julien in the Var department and engulfing the bridge, the only human building drowned at the bottom of this lake. The maximum depth of 55 m is measured directly above the dam. Lake Esparron is an important summer tourism center, frequented for water recreation and for fishing.

The Department of Special Education falls under the Eastern Michigan University College of Education at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The Eastern Michigan University Department of Special Education provides extensive studies for those wanting to participate in the disabled community. There are currently five programs or courses of study one may choose to follow, if they wish to obtain a bachelor's degree and a recommendation to the Michigan Department of Education K‚Äì12 endorsement as a teacher of students with impairments. History Eastern Michigan University Department of Special Education is among the oldest special education program in the United States. In 1923, the Michigan State Legislature passed bills that gave school districts state funds if they included and established special schools for handicapped students: those of cognitive impairment, those of the deaf, those who were crippled or those who were visually impaired. Though the receiving state funds seemed incising, the new bills also included that the educators of these new special schools must be specifically trained for their work. The state board of education came to the realization that such teachers were of no supply. They then established an official department at the Michigan State Normal College (previous name of Eastern Michigan University until 1956). This was the beginning of Eastern Michigan's Department of Education. By 1928, Michigan State Normal College provided classes for teachers training to be educators of the deaf and hard of hearing (now referred to as hearing impaired), for the crippled (now referred to as physical and other health impairments) and for the mentally retarded (now cognitively impaired). In 1929, a class for children with defective vision (now visually impaired) was established.The faculty of Eastern Michigan College (January 1, 1959).\\"Special Education at Eastern\\". The faculty Bulletin 12(1)1 Though the department was made official in 1923, the very first education course in the program was in the summer of 1915The Faculty of Michigan State Normal College (April 2, 1915). The Michigan State Normal College Bulletin 1(1)1 when Dr. Charles Scott Berry took his work from the Feeble-minded school of Lapeer to Michigan State Normal College. Dr. Berry had taken charge of the school until the summer of 1917, where Professor Charles Elliott claimed his spot. The first laboratory class for teachers of the disabled was made possible in 1918, having Miss Blanche Towne as the training teacher. Since then, all of the work set forth by Dr. Berry has been for training teachers for children with various impairments.The faculty of Eastern Michigan College (January 1, 1959).\\"Special Education at Eastern\\". The faculty Bulletin 12(1)1 Original courses The first courses that Michigan State Normal College started for the Department of Special Education were in the summer of 1915. The courses that were offered are as follows: 1\\\\. Mental deficiency 2\\\\. Psychology of backward and mentally deficient children 3\\\\. Methods of training backward and mentally deficient children 4\\\\. Demonstration special class 5\\\\. Health inspection 6\\\\. Mechanics of exercise 7\\\\. Speech defects 8\\\\. Basketry, weaving, and mat work.Thams, Paul (1953) ‚ÄúThe Development of the Special Education Program at Michigan State Normal College‚Äù. P.57. Current majors Eastern Michigan University‚Äôs Department of Special Education currently offers six majors that fulfill five endorsements of teaching. There is a Cognitive Impairment major, and Emotional Impairment major, a Hearing Impairment major, a Speech/Language Pathology major, a Teacher of Students with Physical and other Health Impairment major, and a visual Impairment major. The CI (Cognitive Impaired) major qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan Department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Cognitive Impairment. This particular program requires 151 hours worth of credits, which includes general education credit requirements from the University. The EI (Emotional Impairment) also qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Emotional Impairments. This program requires 136 hours worth of credits. HI, the Hearing Impairment program, qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Hearing Impairment. Eastern Michigan has been an approved center for training teachers of the hearing impaired since 1967. VI, the Visual Impairment program, qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Visual Impairment. Finally, the Speech/Language Pathology Major offered by the Department of Special Education of Eastern Michigan University is one a program that finishes with the completion of a master's degree. The bachelor's degree itself does not qualify the recommendation to the Michigan department of Education. Department residence The Department of Education originally resided in the Peirce building on the campus of Eastern Michigan University. There was very little space for the department there. In 1937, Professor Elliott received $280,000 via the Horace H. and Mary A. Rackham foundation, to construct a building that was specifically made for the training of teachers with various types of handicaps.The faculty of Eastern Michigan College (January 1, 1959). ‚ÄúSpecial Education at Eastern‚Äù.

The band consists of songwriter/guitarist/vocalist Dana. \\"Britney\\" Robertson, bassist Jamie \\"Jimmy\\" Oldfield, songwriter/guitarist/vocalist Marco \\"The Chief\\" Rocca, and drummer Tom \\"T-Bone\\" Antle.  History   Early Days (1992-1995)  Hope was formed by Dana Goofball Robertson (formerly of The Monoxides) on vocals/guitars, and Jamie \\"Jimmy\\" Oldfield on bass/vocals in 1992 Riverview, New Brunswick. Robertson and Oldfield began writing lyrics together after finding common philosophical ground in punk music. Hope's first drummer was Chris Lewis (later of Skinkeeper, Mood Cadillac, Iron Giant, etc.). The band released their first demo, New Love, recorded by Derek \\"Big D\\" Robichaud (of The Monoxides). Jamie actually sang lead vocals on a good portion of the first demo, which is quite rare for the band; Dana has for the most part always been known as the vocalist. Chris Lewis parted ways with Hope to move on to other bands and they recruited Ken Kelley (of The Monoxides) to take on drumming duties on Emus Can Fly, their second official demo (1993). After Ken moved on from Hope, a drummer by the name of Luc Daigle joined the band in 1994, along with the addition of Pascal \\"Pak\\" Toussaint of Sour Grapes on second guitar (from 1995‚Äì1996). This would solidify the Hope lineup for quite a few years. Everythin' About Nuttin' was recorded and mixed by Duane \\"Doolang\\" Kelly and released in 1995. It is little known that Luv Your Mummy (1996) was partially recorded by Rick White (Eric's Trip, Elevator) at his home studio, including early versions of some of the songs that would later be re-recorded on Lupus Man, the rest being tracked once again by the mighty Doolang.  Lupus Man (1996)  Come 1996, Hope had been a solid 3-piece for a few years, playing tons of live gigs around the city with countless local bands finding more success. Hope went into Ham & Cheese Studios at MacNaughton High School to record a great-sounding official EP with Doolang, adding Jeremy Crossman on second guitar solely for this release. This EP includes some of the earliest hits by the band including \\"Treasure Girl\\", \\"Renovations\\" and \\"Summertime\\", which was the band's official single. A music video was also filmed and edited for the song and submitted to Much Music. The video for \\"Summertime\\" saw some decent rotation on MuchEast and was an introduction to the band for a lot of Monctonians. The EP is of course of out print but can rarely be found at Spin It or Livewire in Moncton.  The Chief, State of Halitosis & INMFYU (1997-2000)  In January 1997, Marco \\"The Chief\\" Rocca (of The Disowned) joined Hope as lead guitarist and backup vocalist. After several jams, it was clear Marco would have some of his own songs to bring to the table and the band would function on a co-lead vocalist/background vocalist basis. The band itself had a new tight and solid feel. Refreshed and energized, they went into Ham & Cheese Studios with Doolang armed with an onslaught of new songs, and recorded one of their most solid efforts to date: their first official full-length CD, State of Halitosis. The album was released independently on Dana's Say 10 Records and spawned their huge hit \\"Carolyn Manson\\", for which a video was filmed, receiving marginal success nationwide due to airplay on MuchEast. This song would become a staple for the band in the years to come. Hope would continue playing shows around Moncton and the surrounding area, including trips to Halifax and Sackville. At some point in 1999, Luc Daigle (drums) ended up being replaced due to musical differences. The band jammed with a couple of drummers - Cam Murphy (of The Traits, The Peter Parkers, Ghostown Belle, Thee Requiems), who joined the band for one day, and Craig \\"Crud\\" McFadden (of Malicious Attempt and The McFaddens), also for a short period. The band eventually replaced Luc very temporarily with a Moncton guy named Dave (no one remembers his last name). Signed to Lameass Recordz-based out of Calgary, in 2000 Hope would go on to record their sophomore release \\"It's Not My Fault You're Ugly\\", again recorded by Doolang at Ham & Cheese Studios. The album was distributed nationwide and was very well received. Dave was removed from the band shortly after the recording of INMFYU and replaced with the superior Tom \\"T-Bone\\" Antle (of Orchid and Fermeller) behind the kit, finalizing the band's revolving door of multiple drummers throughout their history. At this point, the band embarked on their first coast-to-coast, nationwide tour. Tom had prior obligations with university at the time, which led to the band tapping Johnny Horseface (of The Carmines and Dean Malenkos) to man the kit solely for the tour.  T-Bone, Feeling Like A Buck Fifty & Warped Tour (1999-2001) The band went into Creative Sound Studios again with Doolang in 2001. Drums, guitars, and some vocals were recorded, at which point a halt was put to the session. After a short break, the band went into Reality Based/Cabin Studios with Kyle \\"MEN\\" McDonald to finish up on the recording of the album. Bass, lead guitars, and lead/backing vocals were completed and the album was mixed and mastered in 2001 by Kyle. The album was pressed, released, and distributed across Canada and the U.S. via Lameass Recordz and the band secured a spot on the Punkrock.net stage at Warped Tour 2002.  Lame-SASS, Do You Smell Gas & INMFYU Re-Recordings (2002-2004)  The band ditched label Lameass Recordz due to poor business decisions by the label, which - not surprisingly - folded shortly thereafter. With a solid period of off-time back in Moncton, they decided to re-record their album INMFYU with Kyle at Reality Based Studios. The difference was the much better T-Bone manning the drums, not to mention that several of the songs had gone through structure changes, new vocal parts and harmonies, guitar leads, etc. Along with the album in full (minus the song \\"Who Farted??\\"), they laid down a couple of re-worked versions of older songs and rarities as well as a cover of \\"Bonzo\\" by the Ramones. These re-recordings (minus the re-recorded version of \\"Meathead\\" and a demo of a new song titled \\"haiHaiHAI!\\") were released in full exclusively via their website in mp3 format and stayed there for an extended period of time. A few weeks afterwards, the band went to Halifax to record with Laurence Currie along with the Dean Malenkos for a split EP entitled Do You Smell Gas?. For this release, Hope recorded two new songs, \\"Suck Factory\\" and \\"Almost Like\\", and covered the Malenkos' song \\"Jon's Gone Straightedge\\". Meanwhile, the Malenkos recorded two new songs and covered the Hope song \\"Raelienation\\".  HOPE S/T & Milk & Cookies (2005-2007)  Hope tapped Dean Malenkos drummer, Horseface, to produce their latest full-length album, which boasts 11 meaty tracks that are truly indicative of the band's sheer power. From the pumping \\"Mental Morphine\\" to the spastic \\"I Don‚Äôt Want To Change The World,\\" Hope is headed in a single direction‚Ä¶straight to the top. Hope recorded its new self-titled album in Halifax with award-winning producer Laurence Currie (Sloan, The Gandharvas). Most of the album itself was recorded by Craig Sperry, who also recorded and mixed the upcoming debut album by The Nuclear. The band toured extensively through 2005-2007, opened for NOFX in Halifax 2006 and played three shows at Warped Tour 2007. Just prior to heading out for Warped Tour, Dana, Kyle and Don collaborated to put together a Hope rarities album entitled Nevermind The Monoxides, Here's Hope! The limited edition of only 100 copies includes some of the most sought after rare tracks by the band.  Split 7\\", Live Album and Future Demos (2007-present)  HOPE Live Album Recording April 4, 2008, Poster by Sebas TheriaultHope recorded a new song entitled \\"Lungs Back\\" live at their jam spot,which was mixed to 2-track on the fly by Kyle, for their contribution to the Hope/Fear of Lipstick/The Damnsels/Sour Grapes Split 7\\" due sometime in 2008. A couple weeks afterwards on April 4, 2008, the band recorded their first live album at The Paramount Lounge with Kyle. The show featured acoustic opening acts by Denis of Secondsdown, Ilisha French of The Damnsels, Don Levandier & Nathan Jones of The Motorleague, and Pak Toussaint & Dana Robertson of The Payrents. The album is still in the mixing stages and is due at some point in 2008. Hope also have plans to demo tracks with Kyle in late 2008 for their next full-length album.

(1950), Portuguese Rule and Spanish Crown in South Africa, 1581-1640, Cape Town: Juta.  History  The Fortress of Kambambe was constructed in 1604 by governor Jo√£o de Lencastre as a point of support to the conquest and penetration of Angolan territory through the Cuanza River. The date of construction was 1604, or 1691 according to the pediment over the entrance door. The occupation of Cambambe was very costly to Portugal on account of resistance offered by the natives to the foreign authority. Besides enforcing the armed presence of Portugal, the fortress was used for the storage of prisoners and goods awaiting shipment to the Americas. Cambambe was an important center for illegal activity and the slave trade. From here, the Portuguese organized attacks on nearby villages to capture slaves. The Fortress of Kambambe was classified as National Monument by Provincial Decree Number 67, dated May 30, 1925. Later it fell into ruins and is a state property.

Holyoke College and the Mischords of Middlebury College, it is one of the oldest women's college a cappella singing groups in the United States. History Chattertocks, 1964 Nancy Tobin, Dorothy Senerchia, and the late Helen Johnson, Class of 1955 at Pembroke College (Brown University) together with twelve other Pembroke College freshmen, founded the Chattertocks women's a cappella group in 1952. The group was started by members of the dormitory, Sharpe House, as a parody of the Brown Jabberwocks, the men's a cappella group. On April 28, 1952, the Chattertocks entered an inter-dorm song contest. Each dorm was to perform two songs. The Sharpe House chairmen were Helen \\"Lynn\\" Johnson and Dorothy \\"Dolly\\" Senerchia. Senerchia came up with the idea to mimic the Jabberwocks. Calling themselves the Chattertocks, they borrowed grey flannel suits, white bucks, white button-down shirts, rep ties, pinned their hair back, took up the hands- in-the-pocket stance. They sang ‚ÄúHalls of Ivy‚Äù and ‚ÄúMood Indigo,‚Äù Jabberwock standards. Coached by Tobin's boyfriend, Jabberwock John Dorer, they won first place. No longer performing in grey flannel suits, the group has continued to grow and evolve with the changing times. The Chattertocks started recording early on with a number of vinyl albums. In the mid-1960s they added guitar and percussion back-up, both common for college singing groups. In 1982 they added choreography and comedy skits to their concerts. The Chattertocks traditionally perform \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)\\" in Latin at the annual Brown University Latin Carol Service, established in 1948. ‚ÄúDuodecem Dies Natalis‚Äù was translated into Latin by Eunice Burr Couch and to this day is performed by ‚ÄúGrex Chattertockarum,‚Äù literally, the \\"Herd of Chattertocks.\\"Encyclopedia Brunoniana by Martha Mitchell, copyright ¬©1993 by the Brown University Library. Another Chattertocks tradition is performing with The Brown Derbies in their annual concert, \\"Smoked Salomon,\\" which occurs every September in Salomon Hall on the Brown University campus. The Chattertocks traditionally perform \\"S/NC,\\" a parody of Brown's school culture and non-traditional grading system set to the tune of The Beatles' \\"Let It Be.\\" Awards The Chattertocks won their second \\"first prize\\" ($100) in the first \\"Intercollegiate Folk Festival of New England,\\" which was sponsored by the Junior Class of Providence College and was held at Providence College, R.I. on October 26, 1963. Since then the Chattertocks have recorded several CDs and have competed successfully in the National Championship of College A Cappella (NCCA)NCCA since the competition's inception in 1996. In 1998, the Chattertocks were in the NCCA finals, which were held in Carnegie Hall in New York City. In more recent years, the Chattertocks have maintained their rich tradition of excellence, taking home \\"Best Album\\" and \\"Best Song\\" in the 2004 Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards.Best Album Most recently the Chattertocks were selected to be on the \\"Best of College A Cappella\\" CD of 2011, juried and chosen by Varsity Vocals. Current activity Today, the group performs at colleges around the country appearing on campuses and local television stations. In addition to their earlier vinyl albums, they have produced eleven CDs with their signature song, \\"My Funny Valentine\\" by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart appearing on each one. Several of their alumnae, such as Gwyneth Walker (composer), Susan Bennett (commercial vocalist and voice of Siri), Ellen Turner Harris, (Professor of Music at Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Anitra Brooks Kocyba (vocalist), Sophie Elgort (New York based photographer), Deb Talan (singer), and Stephanie Cotsirillos (performer) have gone on to become successful musicians and performers.

They play in the South Premier of the Rugby League Conference. History The Greenwich Admirals side was founded in 2001 as the brainchild of Chief Executive of the London Broncos' Lionel Hurst and under the guidance of development officer Graeme Thompson. Greenwich Admirals were to continue the Broncos' development work in the area after the Broncos moved away from south east London to a new home in Brentford. An introductory game was played on 11 August 2001 against South London Storm, the Admirals team being made up of rugby union players from Old Brockleians RFC and Greenwich RFC and players borrowed from Storm; Greenwich won 28 - 24. Jason Henley was recruited as Head Coach and in February 2002, the club was formally set up with a committee, constitution and club rules. Greenwich made it to the 2002 London League grand final in their inaugural season. The final against Crawley Jets held at Crawley, was won 38 - 22. Greenwich Admirals joined the London & South Division of the Rugby League Conference in 2003 whilst a Greenwich Admirals second team took part in the London League. The first team won more games than it lost, finally finding form at the end of the season with victories over South London Storm, North London Skolars A and Essex Eels on the way to the RLC Shield quarter-finals. The second team reached the semi-finals of the London League play-offs. The club moved to the Woolwich Barracks Rugby Fields in 2004. Greenwich lost only one game all year on the way to the South Divisional Final. Greenwich went down to a West London Sharks side led by Trevor Leota in the final. In 2005, the Conference developed a new tier of Premier Divisions, Greenwich Admirals stepped up to the newly created Premier South. The club was thrown into turmoil as it lost its coaching team because of outside issues. The club lost senior players and had to be replaced by second team and junior players. The season closed with the team finishing bottom of the table. Greenwich left the Premier South and joined the South East Division of the Conference. The club relocated again to Mayday Gardens. Greenwich beat Kent Ravens in a play-off eliminator to set up a grand final against new boys Broadstairs Bulldogs which they lost. In 2007, the first team finished third in their division on points difference and were eliminated at the semi-final stage of the divisional play-offs. In 2009 Greenwich Admirals youth section had a very successful year. The under-14s reached the final but lost to Elmbridge Eagles in what was seen as a one-sided encounter. The under-16s reached the semi-finals but were also edged out 36-12 by Elmbridge Eagles. The under-18s, who were only formed in the 2009 season, also reached the final but lost to South London Storm Academy. Youth teams Greenwich Admirals run youth age groups in the London Junior League from under-14s all the way up to under-18s, giving the first team a great feed of youth talent. Greenwich Admirals' youth section, is renowned for producing good players. This was shown in 2009 when Jacko Brennan and Gary Seargant were both selected in the 32-man England squad for games against France and the Australian Institute Of Sport. In 2010 both the under-16 and under-18 teams became London champions beating Hainault and Medway in their respective finals. Greenwich Admirals now play their games in Kidbrooke Lane, Eltham, at Blackheath FC Well Hall ground.

Martyrdom According to tradition, Denise was martyred during the persecution of Christians by the Emperor Decius, along with three men named Andrew, Paul, and Nichomachus.F√©lix Amat, Tratado de la Iglesia de Jesucristo (Madrid: S.N., 1806), Lib. IV, Cap. II. Nichomachus, \\"presumptuous and over-confident\\",Campbell, Thomas. \\"St. Andrew.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 5 Apr. 2013 denied that he was a Christian after he was tortured and was asked to perform a sacrifice to the Roman gods. However, as he was about to perform this task, he suffered a convulsion and fell dead. Andrew and Paul refused to apostatize and were tortured on the rack and then imprisoned. Denise was a sixteen-year-oldSome sources say 29-year-old (see below) Christian girl who vocalized her unhappiness regarding Nichomachus' apostasy. She was brought before the proconsul Optimus, and refused to abjure her faith. Optimus condemned her to be raped by several soldiers; however, according to tradition, she was \\"subjected to the approaches of three libertines, but was protected by an angel.\\" Paul and Andrew were finally led to their execution, and were stoned to death in the local arena. Denise managed to escape from prison and locate the bodies of the two men. She publicly expressed her desire to share their martyrdom, was carried away by force, and was promptly ordered to be beheaded by Optimus. Feast day The feast day of these saints is observed in the Roman Catholic Church on May 15, and in the Eastern Orthodox Church on May 18 (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, May 18 falls on May 31 of the modern Gregorian Calendar). Relics Relics attributed to Denise were brought to the Abbey of Fl√¥ne in Belgium in 1922, and placed within a statue of wax; the relics included a vase associated that contains her crystallized blood. A second vase contains earth said to have been drenched with the blood of Christian martyrs. On the sarcophagus is embedded a marble tablet said to come from Roman catacombs; it carries the inscription: DIONISE, V.M..I.IN.P VIX. AN. XXIX. (\\"Denise, celebrated virgin martyr rests in peace. She lived 29 years\\"). The relics are visible through small openings; in the modern era this saint is invoked for protection against bicycle and motorcycle accidents and headaches.

It encompasses a collection of five well preserved Colonial Revival triple-deckers located at 31-39 Beaver Street, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The five buildings in this Beaver Street subdivision are located just southwest of the Clark University campus in southern Worcester, near the junction of Beaver Street with Florence and Oliver Streets. They are set on the southeast side of the street, running northeasterly from Clement Street. All were built c. 1916, at a time when Worcester's more fashionable development was moving from the Woodland Street area to the west side, and when the streetcar made the Main South area more readily accessible to factory workers. The typical early owners and occupants of them were Irish American families where the men were laborers or machinists, and the women who worked outside the home had office jobs. The five buildings are identical in their basic structure, a rectangular three story wood frame building with a side hall entry, and protruding bay sections on the front and left side. All have front porches that rise to three stories, but the decorative details and number of supporting columns differ among them. 37 Beaver Street is distinctive in the group for having a full width first floor porch and a gable end with full pediment, while numbers 31 and 35 have first floor side porches sheltering the entry. At the time of their listing in 1990 all were clad in wood clapboards and shingles.

Beltr√°n de Cetina y del Castillo (Alcal√° de Henares, 1521 ‚Äì M√©rida de Yucat√°n, 1600?) was one of the original conquistadors and founders of M√©rida in the modern Mexican state of Yucat√°n. His siblings included: Renaissance poet Gutierre de Cetina; Ana Andrea del Castillo, self-described conquistadora and wife of Francisco de Montejo the Younger; and Gregorio de Cetina, also a conqueror of Yucat√°n.  From Andalusia to Mexico  Seville, Andalusia, in the 16th century His father, Beltr√°n de Cetina y Alcocer, was born to Gutierre de Cetina y Hurtado de Mendoza and Menc√≠a de Alcocer (of partial converso ancestry) c. 1498. The parents came, for the most part, from old hidalgo families long resident in Alcal√° de Henares, although the patrilineal descent ultimately stemmed from the village of Cetina, in the Kingdom of Aragon.Vicar general of Madrid Doctor Gutierre de Cetina, remembered principally for his granting of ecclesiastical approval for the publication of the Second Part of Don Quixote, was the grandnephew of Beltr√°n de Cetina y Alcocer, being the grandson of the latter's sister, Constanza Cetina Alcocer (sometimes styled de Alcocer Cetina). As a youth Beltr√°n de Cetina y Alcocer moved to Seville, where he met and married Francisca del Castillo y Zanabria, daughter of Garc√≠a del Castillo and Mar√≠a Mayora, a local of likely Morisco descent. The nuptials were celebrated in 1518 in Seville. In 1519 was born Gutierre, in 1521 Beltr√°n in Alcal√° de Henares, in 1525 Ana Andrea, and in 1527 Gregorio. The plaque on the convent wall reads in part: This is the sepulchre of...Beltran de Cetina, father of...poet Gutierre de Cetina... The family lived for many years in the parish neighborhood of Santa Mar√≠a la Blanca, within the old aljama or Jewish quarter of Seville. The father, possibly owing to family influences, obtained in 1536 the job of almoxarife mayor (chief tax official and treasurer) for the city and its ports. The Cetina family's comfortable position allowed them to own slaves (some of them Indian) and to realize the construction of a family tomb in the Dominican convent of Madre de Dios de la Piedad, in which would also be laid the remains of do√±a Juana de Z√∫√±iga and do√±a Catalina Cort√©s, wife and daughter of Hern√°n Cort√©s, respectively; as well as the great- granddaughters of Christopher Columbus. In 1535 occurred the immigration to New Spain of the siblings: Andrea Cetina, Beltr√°n Cetina, and Garc√≠a del Castillo, accompanied by their aunt, Antonia del Castillo (wife of Gonzalo L√≥pez, another notable Sevillian, who five years before had participated in Nu√±o de Guzm√°n's campaign to conquer the lands that later would become Nueva Galicia).  The lives of Andrea, Beltr√°n, Gregorio, and Gutierre de Cetina  A 19th-century print of the Casa de Montejo, famous for its elaborate plateresque facade, home of Francisco de Montejo y Le√≥n and Andrea del Castillo and later their descendants In 1539 Andrea del Castillo married Francisco de Montejo y Le√≥n; the couple would eventually help found and settle the city of M√©rida. The marriage produced three children: Beatriz de Montejo (born ca. 1543), Juan de Montejo (born ca. 1544), and Francisca del Castillo (born. ca. 1545).Francisca de Montejo y del Castillo married cavalry captain Carlos de Arellano, an uncle of Mart√≠n Cort√©s. Although the union is mentioned in passing by Bishop de Landa (who knew the family personally) in his Relaci√≥n (ca. 1566), it is Fray Diego L√≥pez de Cogolludo who relates in his Historia de Yucat√°n (1688) that Montejo y Le√≥n died insolvent, bequeathing to his son Juan the encumbrance of paying his significant remaining debts, and causing his widow to petition the King of Spain, with both unusual assertiveness and effectiveness,\\"I am no less a conquistadora than are the conquistadores...often the leading women of my quality when they are found present in wars and conquests...with their special vision invigorate themselves and work well and serve their monarchs and lords with more energy and valour [than the men].\\" (As cited in Hugh Thomas's work The Conquest.) for a pension and the right of retaining ownership of the complex of properties (solares) on the plaza mayor of M√©rida (part of which, the Casa de Montejo, would continue to be lived in by her descendants into the 19th-century). In 1541 Beltr√°n de Cetina y del Castillo was named by his brother-in-law, Montejo \\"the Younger,\\" as his civil and military lieutenant (capit√°n y justicia mayor) in the garrison of San Francisco de Campeche. The following January the city of M√©rida was founded, inscribed in the roster of first citizens (vecinos) appears the name of the aforementioned Beltr√°n de Zetina (sic). Beltr√°n's role as a conquistador is documented in the list of men who conquered the Yucat√°n with Montejo compiled by chronicler Baltasar Dorantes de Carranza, son of Andr√©s Dorantes, survivor of the fateful Narv√°ez expedition. In 1547 this same Beltr√°n was made, along with other close associates, a regidor or city councilman by the adelantado Francisco de Montejo y √Ålvarez de Tejeda. The following year his father (his mother already having died) named in his testamento or will as his principal heirs his eight children (all were legitimate, though some did not opt to use the paternal surname): Gutierre de Cetina, Garc√≠a del Castillo, Beltr√°n de Cetina, Gregorio de Cetina, Menc√≠a de Santo Domingo Alcocer, Leonor de Cetina, Mar√≠a del Castillo, and Ana Andrea del Castillo. In 1550 Gregorio de Cetina obtained permission to travel to New Spain, along with his cousins Pedro and Diego L√≥pez, in order to help in the administration of the properties of his uncle, Gonzalo L√≥pez. The latter, who had attained the rank of maestre de campo during Cort√©s's Conquest of Mexico, had previously been accompanied by the eldest of the brothers, Gutierre, during a trip to New Spain in 1546, realized for the purposes of serving as procurador general (procurator general) of the colony. In 1553, sons of former M√©rida regidor Beltr√°n de Cetina and his Sevillian wife Isabel de Velasco, Beltr√°n and Gregorio de Cetina y Velasco (there was also another, more obscure, brother named Antonio), traveled to New Spain on a ship captained by Juan de Andino, to live as encomenderos, ultimately leaving multiple descendants in Yucat√°n, Tabasco, Campeche, and places further afield. Portrait of Gutierre de Cetina included in the Libro de descripci√≥n de...Retratos de Ilustres... In 1554, Gutierre returned to Mexico only to die in Villa del Esp√≠ritu Santo as a result of an infected facial-wound received on April 1 of that year while residing in Puebla, and which was inflicted by the volatile son of one of Panfilo de Narv√°ez's followers, Hernando de Nava, who mistook the poet for Francisco de Peralta, rival for the favors and amours of Leonor de Osma, a lady married to the notable and elderly physician Pedro de la Torre. A portrait, purported to be a true likeness of Gutierre, accompanied by a biographical sketch, is included by painter and poet Francisco Pacheco in his 1599 Libro de descripci√≥n de verdaderos Retratos de Ilustres y memorables varones (Book of the Description of the True Portraits of Illustrious and Memorable Men). Garc√≠a del Castillo, having married Catalina L√≥pez de Olivares, daughter of the notable Sevillian judge Juan de Olivares and his wife Beatriz L√≥pez, settled in the City of Mexico; numbering among his children the bachiller and presbyter cleric (cl√©rigo presb√≠tero) Beltr√°n de Cetina (born ca. 1558), a graduate of the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. Mar√≠a del Castillo (the third sibling so surnamed) married influential conquistador Francisco Tamayo de Pacheco and settled in M√©rida. Gregorio de Zetina y del Castillo, having settled in M√©rida, married Mariana (or Mar√≠a) de Quijada y Contreras, niece of Diego de Quijada, alcalde mayor of Yucat√°n from 1561‚Äì1565, and daughter of Crist√≥bal Guti√©rrez (a conquistador and settler of Chiapas) and Ana de Contreras; their numerous children were Francisca del Castillo, Beltr√°n de Cetina, Gregorio de Cetina, Diego Quijada, Juan Quijada, Gutierre de Cetina, Hernando de Porras, Gabriel de Cetina, Crist√≥bal Quijada, and Andr√©s del Castillo (the surnaming custom was not necessarily linear).Gutierre de Cetina and Hernando de Porras were twins, the former, and poet's namesake, married In√©s de Arbieto, among his issue, another Gregorio de Cetina (born ca. 1612). L√≥pez de Cogolludo relates that Diego Quijada Cetina became a Franciscan friar and was fluent in Mayan; one day he suffered an unspecified accident that caused him to become deranged, to the degree that he had to be restrained, but when brought to his sister Francisca's house he fully and \\"miraculously\\" recovered. Francisca de Cetina married Francisco de Loaysa, among their issue, the familiarly named Gregorio Loaysa Cetina (born. c. 1600). Gregorio de Cetina was for a time steward of the chapel of San Juan Bautista, in M√©rida, position from which he profited financially. Many of the brothers, their relatives and dependants, left record of their migratory movements in the Casa de Contrataci√≥n de Indias of Seville. The Cetinas were related by blood or marriage to the Montejos, the Pachecos, the Ortizes de San Pedro, the Rozas, among others, all of whom are counted as being among the first colonizers of Mexico and other lands.

Its methods may be used on other types of systems subject to accumulated variation, such as mechanical and electrical systems. Engineers analyze tolerances for the purpose of evaluating geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T;). Methods include 2D tolerance stacks, 3D Monte Carlo simulations, and datum conversions. Tolerance stackups or tolerance stacks are used to describe the problem-solving process in mechanical engineering of calculating the effects of the accumulated variation that is allowed by specified dimensions and tolerances. Typically these dimensions and tolerances are specified on an engineering drawing. Arithmetic tolerance stackups use the worst-case maximum or minimum values of dimensions and tolerances to calculate the maximum and minimum distance (clearance or interference) between two features or parts. Statistical tolerance stackups evaluate the maximum and minimum values based on the absolute arithmetic calculation combined with some method for establishing likelihood of obtaining the maximum and minimum values, such as Root Sum Square (RSS) or Monte-Carlo methods. Modeling In performing a tolerance analysis, there are two fundamentally different analysis tools for predicting stackup variation: worst-case analysis and statistical analysis. Worst-case Worst-case tolerance analysis is the traditional type of tolerance stackup calculation. The individual variables are placed at their tolerance limits in order to make the measurement as large or as small as possible. The worst-case model does not consider the distribution of the individual variables, but rather that those variables do not exceed their respective specified limits. This model predicts the maximum expected variation of the measurement. Designing to worst-case tolerance requirements guarantees 100 percent of the parts will assemble and function properly, regardless of the actual component variation. The major drawback is that the worst-case model often requires very tight individual component tolerances. The obvious result is expensive manufacturing and inspection processes and/or high scrap rates. Worst-case tolerancing is often required by the customer for critical mechanical interfaces and spare part replacement interfaces. When worst-case tolerancing is not a contract requirement, properly applied statistical tolerancing can ensure acceptable assembly yields with increased component tolerances and lower fabrication costs. Statistical variation The statistical variation analysis model takes advantage of the principles of statistics to relax the component tolerances without sacrificing quality. Each component's variation is modeled as a statistical distribution and these distributions are summed to predict the distribution of the assembly measurement. Thus, statistical variation analysis predicts a distribution that describes the assembly variation, not the extreme values of that variation. This analysis model provides increased design flexibility by allowing the designer to design to any quality level, not just 100 percent. There are two chief methods for performing the statistical analysis. In one, the expected distributions are modified in accordance with the relevant geometric multipliers within tolerance limits and then combined using mathematical operations to provide a composite of the distributions. The geometric multipliers are generated by making small deltas to the nominal dimensions. The immediate value to this method is that the output is smooth, but it fails to account for geometric misalignment allowed for by the tolerances; if a size dimension is placed between two parallel surfaces, it is assumed the surfaces will remain parallel, even though the tolerance does not require this. Because the CAD engine performs the variation sensitivity analysis, there is no output available to drive secondary programs such as stress analysis. In the other, the variations are simulated by allowing random changes to geometry, constrained by expected distributions within allowed tolerances with the resulting parts assembled, and then measurements of critical places are recorded as if in an actual manufacturing environment. The collected data is analyzed to find a fit with a known distribution and mean and standard deviations derived from them. The immediate value to this method is that the output represents what is acceptable, even when that is from imperfect geometry and, because it uses recorded data to perform its analysis, it is possible to include actual factory inspection data into the analysis to see the effect of proposed changes on real data. In addition, because the engine for the analysis is performing the variation internally, not based on CAD regeneration, it is possible to link the variation engine output to another program. For example, a rectangular bar may vary in width and thickness; the variation engine could output those numbers to a stress program which passes back peak stress as a result and the dimensional variation be used to determine likely stress variations. The disadvantage is that each run is unique, so there will be variation from analysis to analysis for the output distribution and mean, just like would come from a factory. While no official engineering standard covers the process or format of tolerance analysis and stackups, these are essential components of good product design. Tolerance stackups should be used as part of the mechanical design process, both as a predictive and a problem-solving tool. The methods used to conduct a tolerance stackup depend somewhat upon the engineering dimensioning and tolerancing standards that are referenced in the engineering documentation, such as American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Y14.5, ASME Y14.41, or the relevant ISO dimensioning and tolerancing standards. Understanding the tolerances, concepts and boundaries created by these standards is vital to performing accurate calculations. Tolerance stackups serve engineers by: * helping them study dimensional relationships within an assembly. * giving designers a means of calculating part tolerances. * helping engineers compare design proposals. * helping designers produce complete drawings.  Concept of Tolerance vector loop  The starting point for the tolerance loop; typically this is one side of an intended gap, after pushing the various parts in the assembly to one side or another of their loose range of motion. Vector loops define the assembly constraints that locate the parts of the assembly relative to each other. The vectors represent the dimensions that contribute to tolerance stackup in the assembly. The vectors are joined tip-to-tail, forming a chain, passing through each part in the assembly in succession. A vector loop must obey certain modeling rules as it passes through a part. It must: # enter through a joint, # follow the datum path to the Datum Reference Frame (DRF), # follow a second datum path leading to another joint, and # exit to the next adjacent part in the assembly. Additional modeling rules for vector loops include: # Loops must pass through every part and every joint in the assembly. # A single vector loop may not pass through the same part or the same joint twice, but it may start and end in the same part. # If a vector loop includes exactly the same dimension twice, in opposite directions, the dimension is redundant and must be omitted. # There must be enough loops to solve for all of the kinematic variables (joint degrees of freedom). You will need one loop for each three variables. The above rules will vary depending on whether 1D, 2D or 3D tolerance stackup method is used.  Concerns with tolerance stackups  A safety factor is often included in designs because of concerns about: * Operational temperature and pressure of the parts or assembly. * Wear. * Deflection of components after assembly. * The possibility or probability that the parts are slightly out of specification (but passed inspection). * The sensitivity or importance of the stack (what happens if the design conditions are not met).

Description and history The George Bentley House is located in a residential area east of downtown Worcester, on the south side of Earle Street between Edward and Elizabeth Streets. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, mostly finished in modern siding. It has a steeply pitched gable roof with original bargeboard in the eaves, a bracketed hood over its front entry, and a side porch with elaborate woodwork trim and chamfered posts. The windows have decorative hood molding, and there are gabled dormers projecting from the roof faces. The left bay of the front facade has a two-story polygonal projecting bay. Later in the 19th century, Queen Anne-style scale shingle treatment was added to its gables. The house was built in 1849-50 by John Barrett, who purchased the empty lot in 1849, and sold it, with house standing, the following year to George Bentley and Daniel Jackson. Bentley and Jackson were listed as clerks working for the Nashua Railroad. The house is a typical example of the type of housing built during the early suburbanization of the area in the 1850s, and is one of its only survivors. Its later alterations, mainly the addition of scale shingles and the raising of the front bay, do not detract from its Gothic features, but some have been lost by the application of modern siding.

Bliss Building is an historic apartment building at 26 Old Lincoln Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built in 1888, the four story brick building is one of the few remnants of a once larger development of apartment blocks north of Lincoln Square; most of the other period apartment blocks in the area were demolished by highway development or urban renewal processes. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Bliss Building is set amidst a collection of wide city streets, hemmed in on the west by the major intersection of Lincoln and Salisbury Streets, and a railroad line and Interstate 290 to the east. It faces east toward Old Lincoln Street, once the main alignment of Lincoln Street, which runs northeast from downtown Worcester toward West Boylston. The building is a rectangular four-story masonry structure, fashioned out of red brick with sandstone trim. Its main facade has a stone water table between the basement and ground floors, and three asymmetrically-placed windows on each side of its recessed entrance. The entrance opening is flanked by stone pilasters and topped by a stone segmented arch. The first floor windows have stone sills joined by a stringcourse of stone, and a second stringcourse connects the windows just below the stone lintels. The upper floors have six windows, divided into groups of two by brick pilasters. A corbelled brick stringcourse joins the second-floor windows, and the center pair of windows on the third floor have segmented-arch tops. A band of corbelled brickwork separates the fourth floor from a parapet containing a stone panel identifying the building. The building was constructed in 1888 to a design by Barker & Nourse, local architects. It was built for William Bliss, a local real estate developer. The Lincoln Square area where it stands was originally lined with similar buildings, but it is now one of the only ones left after urban renewal resulted in the demolition of the others.

Fatigue remains a formidable enemy in theater operations due to its pervasive impact on cognitive effectiveness during flight. Incidents of fatigue-related errors continue to affect the stability and effectiveness of pilots engaged in 24-7 operations: approximately 20% of all Air Force/Air National Guard aviation mishaps have fatigue as either a causal or contributing factor. History One solution to the issue of fatigue within sustained operations came when the United States Department of Defense (DoD) sought to find a way to identify and quantify potential danger zones related to fatigue. In 1996, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) began work on the Sleep Performance Model (SPM), in order to perform analysis related to sleep deprivation and its effects on human performance. It led to the development of the SAFTE (Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness) model ‚Äì a model which calculates effectiveness based on the human sleep/work cycle.DoD's SAFTE Model, Hursh, et al., http://www.nps.navy.mil/orfacpag/resumePages/projects/Fatigue/HurshSAFTEFAST.pdf In 2001, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), through a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant, sponsored the development of the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST), a user interface on the SAFTE model. The outputs rendered through FAST identify time intervals represented through work and sleep durations. FAST was used in safety investigation boards to model mishap pilots; however, usability issues prevented it from widespread adoption for routine operational use. In 2007, the Air National Guard Safety Division, led by Lt Col Edward Vaughan, funded development of a new, Warfighter-centric application based on the WRAIR Sleep Performance Model / SAFTE algorithm. In 2007-08, the Air National Guard (NGB/SEF) and MACROsystems, Inc. developed the FlyAwake.org interface in order to provide an application usable at the squadron level. Many ANG Wings participated in development of the initial application, to ensure a product which met end user needs. The FlyAwake interface contains its own individual set of controls particular to each type of aircraft and mission flown by the ANG. In an effort to ease the burden of data entry, the FlyAwake graphical user interface (GUI) is pre-populated with default data based on aircraft type, relating directly to specified flight duties. Through this method of capture, schedulers and pilots are able to identify familiar controls that are specific to the military‚Äôs individualized mode of operations. In addition, an intelligent sleep algorithm is in progress, based on surveys of active duty and ANG units. Current status As of FY09, MACROsystems has embarked on v2.0 of the FlyAwake application, partnering with WRAIR and Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC) on behalf of OSD‚Äôs Defense Safety Oversight Council (DSOC). Anticipated launch of the new joint military application is set for mid-2009. Safety Programs The FlyAwake application was developed through ANG Safety‚Äôs Disruptive Solutions Process (DSP);Defenselink article on DSP a process which invests small amounts of resources in many innovative ideas from the field and develops those that show success and return on investment. This process has led to other successful DoD-wide safety programs such as seeandavoid.org, Maintenance Resource Management, Low Level Deconfliction and RideANG. DSP‚Äôs inventor, Lt. Col. Edward Vaughan, has recently been inducted into the Air Force Safety Hall of Fame for his revolutionary, entrepreneurial approach to safety program management.

They came from a show-biz family, and were child performers touring Lanarkshire clubs from an early age. They initially joined their father David and sister Lily, a pianist, on stage as puppeteers. They remained in show-business for almost seven decades. Lily became their manager, and continued until her death in 1998. Their father was David Watt, a ventriloquist and children's entertainer who went by the stage name \\"Valentine Prince\\". He came from a family of musicians. Fran and Anna came from a family of five siblings who never married and who shared a house in Coatbridge. They performed as \\"The Prince Sisters\\" internationally and on cruise ships in the 1950s and 1960s. In the early 1970s they changed their name to \\"Fran and Anna\\", and started to appear regularly on the Scottish Television programme Thingummyjig. They also appeared with Terry Wogan on his show in the 1980s. They were both awarded the British Empire Medal in 1989 for services to light entertainment. Fran and Anna were known for their tartan miniskirts, rouged cheeks and fishnet stockings. They were known for jabot- fronted tartan mini dresses, with matching tartan hats, each decorated with a large feather. Their style is often referred to as \\"tartan kitsch\\" They are reported to have worn their trademark style daily. Showbiz friend Johnny Beattie said that he never saw them without full make-up and costume, even when not working, \\"I think they even went to bed like that\\". Fran and Anna performed many times at the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow, giving their last performance there in 2002 alongside Jack Milroy and Johnny Beattie and with Gordon Cree at the piano. Fran died of pneumonia in 2003. Terry Wogan praised Fran and Anna in his condolences on Fran's death. Anna died of natural causes at St Andrews Hospice in Airdrie six years later. The sisters were reunited in death and are buried alongside one another in Old Monkland Cemetery, Coatbridge.

Early life Martha J. Nash was born in Plainfield, Massachusetts on 13 August 1826, the third of the four children of Arvin Nash and Lucinda Vinton. Her mother died when Martha was a child and her father remarried and with his second wife had two more children. Martha Nash was educated at several schools in Massachusetts: in Goshen, at the Williston Seminary in Easthampton (1844-45), and at the Northampton High School. She did especially well in mathematics and taught that subject at schools in Newark, New Jersey and Maumee, Ohio. On 8 September 1852 she married Charles A. Lamb in Maumee. He was a mechanic who had two daughters from an earlier marriage. The Lambs moved to Chicago in 1857 and Martha became involved in charity work. She was a founder, with Jane C. Hoge, of the Home for the Friendless and the Half-Orphan Asylum. In 1863 she served as secretary of Chicago's first Sanitary Fair, held to raise money for soldiers' relief. That same year, she served as secretary to the United States Sanitary Commission Fair.  Literary career  Lamb published her first article, \\"A Visit to My Mother's Birthplace, in her local newspaper, The Daily Hampshire Gazette, in Northampton, Massachusetts in 1847. Her marriage ended by divorce around 1866, and it became necessary for her to support herself financially. She moved to New York City and acted upon her belief that a woman \\"with any brains or any sort of intellectual capacity\\" should work at a significant occupation. She published a series of children's stories in 1869 and 1870. In the 1870s she also wrote Spicy, a romance novel featuring the Sanitary Fair and the Chicago Fire; several Christmas annuals; and articles on a wide array of subjects for Harper's and other periodicals. She also edited The Homes of America. In the course of this writing she realized writing history was her true calling and she began extensive research for History of the City of New York: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress. The first volume on the colonial period was published in 1877; the second volume appeared in 1880. Although she was not trained as a professional historian and favored a narrative rather than analytical approach, her work was praised by the renowned contemporary historian, George Bancroft. In 1883, Lamb purchased the Magazine of American History, a financially struggling monthly founded in 1877.Van Pelt, Daniel, \\"Mrs. Martha J. Lamb\\" [obituary], in Magazine of American History, Vol. 29, No. 2 (February 1893), pp. 126-130. She devoted herself to editing the magazine for the last decade of her life, producing over fifty signed articles and more that were unsigned. She also published articles by others, original documents, book reviews, and other standard components of a professional historical journal at a time when there was little precedent for such an endeavor. The magazine ceased publication shortly after Lamb's death in 1893. Lamb was elected to membership in fifteen historical and learned societies in the United States and Europe. Lamb was a fixture in New York social circles; she had connections with many of the old families she chronicled in her historical writings. She also belonged to numerous historical and patriotic societies. She was twice invited to the White House: President Grover Cleveland gave a dinner in her honor in 1886; in 1889 President Benjamin Harrison recognized her contributions to the centennial celebration of Washington's inauguration with an invitation.

It is administered in his name by the pastor and people of the Cathedral of St. Joseph, Manchester. Situated on on two sites, the older in Manchester and the newer in Bedford, New Hampshire, it has served the Catholic families of Manchester for over 160 years. Early years The first recorded burial in what is now Saint Joseph Cemetery was that of Bartholomeu Quinn, who died July 2, 1848. Father William McDonald, Manchester's first permanently assigned Catholic priest, acquired land on a hillside overlooking the city's West Side, more than two miles (3 km) from downtown when Mr. Quinn's death made the establishment of a Catholic cemetery a necessity. For more than twenty years, Father McDonald administered the cemetery from his rectory office at Saint Anne's Church. The only known references in print, however, refer to it simply as ‚Äúthe Catholic cemetery in ‚ÄòSquog.‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄòSquog‚Äù is the nickname given to a broad expanse of land on the banks of the Piscataquog River near its confluence with the Merrimack River, all on Manchester's West Side. By 1869, the Catholic population had grown too large for just one parish. Bishop James Augustine Healy of Portland, Maine, to whose diocese Manchester still belonged, sent Father John O‚ÄôBrien to assist Father McDonald by establishing a new parish, this one dedicated to Saint Joseph. Father O‚ÄôBrien was succeeded by Father Denis Mary Bradley, who would go on to become New Hampshire's first Catholic bishop. Under his pastorate, control of the cemetery was ceded to Saint Joseph parish. The cemetery has borne Saint Joseph's name ever since. The American Civil War The death register for the years 1848 to 1885 has had to be recreated from external sources, such as gravestone markings and newspaper obituaries. The original records, if they still exist, could be stored, unrecognized, in any number of church or civic archives. The Old Cemetery has dozens of low-rising government stones bearing the inscription ‚ÄúGAR‚Äù, for ‚ÄúGrand Army of the Republic.‚Äù Many of these Civil War veterans were among the founders of the Sheridan Guards, a local veterans‚Äô organization that in 1910 donated the outdoor altar on which Mass is offered each year on Memorial Day. Religious communities Shortly after the first Catholic immigrants arrived, pioneering religious men and women followed to found the institutions that would educate, heal, and pray for the new immigrants in the city's first Catholic schools, hospitals and monasteries. To that end, three communities established their own burial grounds within Saint Joseph Cemetery: The Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters Adorers of the Precious Blood, and the Brothers of the Christian Schools. The foundress of the Sisters of Mercy in the United States, Mother Frances Warde, is among those buried here. Her grave has become a place of pilgrimage both for the Sisters of Mercy and for those whom they have educated as the order marks its 150th year in America in 2008. Consecration In 1884, Pope Leo XIII issued the decree separating the parishes in the state of New Hampshire from the Diocese of Portland, Maine, and naming Father Denis Mary Bradley, the pastor of Saint Joseph Church, as the first bishop of the new Diocese of Manchester. Saint Joseph Church became the cathedral. Attachment to the cathedral parish brought new prominence to Saint Joseph Cemetery. Many of Manchester's Catholics, now greater in number and better established economically, began to erect larger and more ornate memorials. The first above-ground family tombs date to this period. The records indicate that Bishop Bradley took a special interest in the development of the cemetery. He made personal inspections, dubbed ‚ÄúEpiscopal Visitations‚Äù, in 1885 and 1888. In 1889, he had the first committal chapel erected on the grounds just inside the Main Gate on the north side of Donald Street. For the preceding forty-one years, the prayers for the dead were offered at graveside, rain or shine. Finally, on December 1, 1889, Saint Joseph Cemetery was formally consecrated according to the centuries-old rite of the Catholic Church. A description of the rites to be performed appeared in the Manchester Union on November 25, 1889: > \\"On the day before a cemetery is blessed or consecrated, five crosses are > erected in it, a large one in the center and a smaller one in each corner. > In front of each of these five crosses a wooden stand or candle holder is > placed, capable of holding three candles. These lifeless wooden stands, > resembling the dryness of fleshless bones, represent man in his grave. They > were set up yesterday, for yesterday is a figure of fleeting time; and in > every corner of the cemetery, to remind us that the empire of death is > spread all over the earth. The three candles, not yet lighted, represent the > imperishable germ of life placed in our bodies by the three persons of the > blessed Trinity. Soon at the direction of the bishop these candles will be > lighted, and I give you the mysterious signification of the light. The cross > in the center of the field is higher than the others, and represents our > Lord Jesus Christ, who, having vanquished death, has become for us the > resurrection and life. He, the first born among the dead, casting his > protecting and saving shadow over his sleeping brethren. From their places > in the four extremities of the field the four smaller crosses proclaim that > the life-giving God of Calvary has flowed to the four quarters of the globe, > to bring life on the day of resurrection to all men, no matter in what age > or clime they may have died. It is therefore a beautiful custom, not to be > omitted, to adorn the grave of every one dying in the Catholic faith, with > the consoling sign of the redemption. Even the most costly and elaborate > monument, if lacking this sign, can in no wise be compared with the ornament > which a simple wooden cross affords to the resting place of the Christian.\\" Expansion New lots in the Old Cemetery have not been laid out or sold since 1954. Even before the First World War, it was clear that space was running out. To accommodate the growth of the Catholic population and in order to minister to its need for a place to bury its dead, Bishop George Albert Guertin acquired an additional in the town of Bedford, a half-mile west of the Old Cemetery. His timing was prophetic. The Spanish Influenza, the flu epidemic that followed America's soldiers home from the trenches of France and Belgium, took so many lives that there was no time for most families to plan for and acquire lots. The dead were numbered and buried in rows in large common graves. The practice of funeral Masses for the dead was suspended to allow for swifter burial, and committals, called ‚ÄúDispensations‚Äù, took place right at graveside. The first several sections of the New Cemetery filled quickly as a result. Modernization In 1946, Monsignor Edward A. Clark, the longest-serving rector of the cathedral, entered into discussion with Ray F. Wyrick, at that time the country's only professional cemetery landscape engineer, concerning the tired appearance of the Old Cemetery and the need to expand the New. Wyrick suggested several sweeping changes which, once they were adopted, made Saint Joseph Cemetery a regional model. The cemetery's roads had all been designed for access by horse and carriage. Wyrick was among the first to see the need for wider roads with expansive curves that could be successfully rounded by motor vehicles with a wider turning radius. His influence in this matter can be seen in sections 2, 3 4, and 8 and in the Memorial Garden bearing Monsignor Clark's name. Wyrick also foresaw the need to end individual and annual care plans. A cemetery's success in maintaining its beauty depends on its ability to sell lots. Beauty is hard to maintain if fewer than 30% of all lots are under Perpetual Care contracts. Family lots of the 19th century were often left untended for months or years at a time. At his suggestion, Saint Joseph Cemetery made Perpetual Care a requirement in 1954. At this time, it also ended the practice of walling or fencing individual lots to allow for mechanized mowing. Influential figures Throughout its history, Saint Joseph Cemetery has had surprisingly few directors and superintendents. For 70 of the 78 years since 1930, administration of the office and grounds changed hands only three times. The longest serving directors were Richard Hammond, George Francis and Elizabeth Merritt. Francis and Merritt were both influential leaders in the New England Cemetery Association and left their stamp on the advanced design, horticultural variety and carefully maintained condition of the cemetery. The pastors of the cathedral and the bishops of Manchester have also taken great care to make the cemetery both a place of reverent remembrance and civic pride. Since no one parish in the area has its own cemetery, the clergy and the people of the cathedral have been, in essence, a board of trustees acting on behalf of all the Catholic faithful whose loved ones are interred here, and they have taken this responsibility seriously. They have had the help of special patrons as well, such as Helen Shaw, who in 1983 donated the funds necessary to erect a new and more comfortable committal chapel in the new cemetery to replace the one erected in 1889. Bishops Ernest Primeau and Leo O‚ÄôNeil and a half dozen of their brother priests are buried on the grounds of this chapel, just to the south its main entry. While the renovation of the cemetery was needed to accommodate the widespread use of motor vehicles, the changes were not without controversy. Gravestones, grave boundaries and remains were removed, changed, and altered. The granite markers were piled in a northeast corner of the property during paving. Some markers were re- installed, some continue to be used as landscaping stones. Others were destroyed. In fact, markers for the \\"Callahan\\" family plot can be seem lining the road near Boynton Street on Hazen Road. It is a continued source of ill will between parishioners and the church. Saint Joseph Cemetery today In 2006, Father Joseph Cooper, pastor of the cathedral, appointed lifetime parishioner John Kelly to succeed Elizabeth Merritt as Director of the Cemetery. At the same time he appointed professional cemetery landscaper Keith Racine as Grounds Superintendent. In the two years since their appointment, they have overseen the renovation of the buildings and equipment and the expansion of the cemetery's services to allow for greater income and greater potential investment.

It was the first of the \\"fraternal benefit societies\\", organizations that would offer insurance as well as sickness, accident, death and burial policies.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1930, p. 82. History AOUW lodge in a former church, Seattle, 1909 The order began when John Jordan Upchurch, a mechanic on the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad living in Meadville, Pennsylvania, became dissatisfied with a group he had joined, the League of Friendship, Mechanical Order of the Sun. The latter society had established a lodge, called a subordinate League, in Meadville on April 20, 1868, and its membership was composed almost entirely of mechanics, engineers, firemen and day labors working on the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad and in the local shops. Upchurch joined the local lodge on June 16, its eighth meeting, and soon rose to become its presiding officer. Another person who would go on to have an important role in the AOUW, William W. Walker, was a charter member. The League of Friendship, Mechanical Order of the Suns avowed purpose was to advance and foster the interests of its members and provide financial assistance on an ad hoc basis. The local lodge was reported to have had a peak membership of about one hundred. Dissension began, apparently, over accusations of improper conduct on part of the Grand Council, the governing body of the League. After the Grand Council ordered a tax from the Meadville League that members thought was inappropriate, many members left. On October 27, 1868, the subordinate League decided to disband.Sackett, Myron Ward, 1841- Early history of fraternal beneficiary societies in America Meadville, Pa., The Tribune publishing company pp. 9‚Äì10 The constitution of the AOUW provided that only white persons were eligible for membership. Upchurch's original idea was to have an order which would unite the conflicting interests of capital and labor, but it soon became more interested in ameliorating working conditions for its members and establishing an insurance fund. The later became the prime focus after October 6, 1869, when the Provisional Grand Lodge accepted an amendment to the charter suggested by Upchurch to reorganize the insurance fund. Previously the Order would simply pay out $500 on the death of a member to his legal heirs. Upchurch's reform instead required each new member to pay a $1 initiation fee to the insurance fund and granted a $2,000 death benefit. When a member died, the fund would be replenished by a new $1 on each member. Those refusing to pay the assessment, and subordinate lodges which failed to forward the money to an insurance fund within a month were ejected from the order. This system came to be called the post mortem plar or the assessment as needed plan.Schmidt p.357 Providing insurance for workingmen was a novel idea in the late 1860s. Previously, insurance was usually limited to businessmen and manufacturers. Numerous bankruptcies of commercial life insurance firms and religious objections had also hindered the development of insurance. The AOUW was convinced that their fraternal structure and less expensive overhead costs made them more likely to succeed than commercial life insurance firms. The organization prospered and by 1885 the Order was the largest fraternal benefit group in the United States. By this point many other groups had imitated the fraternal insurance concept. In 1886 the AOUW took the initiative in calling sixteen of these groups together for a conference to discuss their common issues. The result was the National Fraternal Congress, a group that still exists today as the National Fraternal Congress of America.Schmidt p.358 On August 1, 1893. an amendment to the general laws of the Supreme Lodge said: \\"Any member of the order who shall after August 1, 1893, enter into any business of selling, by retail, intoxicating liquors as a beverage, shall be expelled from the order.\\" To do so would deprive them of the $2,000 death benefit.Johnson, T. & J.W., 1911- \\"Pennsylvania County Court Reports: containing cases decided in the courts of several counties of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Vol. 37: Ida May Nickum v.

The Supreme Lodge structure was abolished in 1929, replaced by a congress. In 1952 the AOUW dissolved and each state affiliate was left to decide its fate. In Massachusetts the state society merged into the New England Order of Protection. In North Dakota the affiliate became the Pioneer Mutual Life Insurance Company, while in Texas the group simply went into receivership. Only the affiliate in Washington state kept the Order active and under its original name. In 1979 the Washington- based Order had 3,000 members, published a AOUW Emblem and met in a \\"supreme lodge\\" biennially. Membership was originally restricted to whites, but this was rescinded at some point. The religious aspects of the Orders ritual was removed in 1932. Upchurch was a freemason, and incorporated various traditions of freemasonry including local \\"lodges\\" (branches), regalia and initiation ceremonies.ANCIENT ORDER OF UNITED WORKMEN The Ancient Order of United Workmen of North Dakota evolved into the Pioneer Mutual Life Insurance Company,https://www.google.com/finance?cid=16477834 which was taken over by American United Life Insurance Company and is now part of OneAmerica.The Companies of OneAmerica The AOUW also had lodges in Canada set up by John Milne, a banker and mayor of Essex, Ontario.

On the territory of the BSSR during the Second World War, about 850,000 Jews were killed. At the moment, more than 680 Belarusians have been recognized as - Righteous Among the Nations, who hid Jews during the war. Nowadays about 130,000 immigrants from Belarus live in Israel. The number of Jews living in Belarus is considered to be around 30-50,000. However, the number of Belarusians with Jewish descent is assumed to be higher.Israeli Ambassador: the closure of the embassy in Minsk was refused due to special relations Alexey ALEXANDROV / 02/16/2017 / 16:24 / Politics  The Great Aliyah  During the 1990s, around 130,000 Belorussian citizens made aliyah to Israel.BELTA photo exhibition \\"Belarus and Israel: 25 Years of Friendship and Partnership\\" opens in Tel Aviv Society Society  20:44 Visa-free travel  In September 2014, an agreement was signed on visa-free entry.

Finland maintains an embassy in Tel Aviv and Israel maintains an embassy in Helsinki. Both countries are full members of the Union for the Mediterranean. History A demonstration in the square Narinkka in central Helsinki in support of the State of Israel. The foundation for bilateral relations between Finland and Israel was laid before the establishment of the State of Israel. Finnish President Paasikivi announced de facto recognition of Israel on 11 June 1948, a month after Israel's declaration of independence. Finland officially recognized the State of Israel on March 18, 1949 and diplomatic relations were established on November 14, 1950. Finland opened its embassy in Tel Aviv in 1952 and Israel opened its embassy in Helsinki in 1956.History of Diplomatic Relations The first Finnish diplomatic representative to Israel was Toivo Kala, who presented his letter of accreditation to Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett. Sharett told Kala that he admired Finland's readiness to defend its rights and its efforts to rebuild after the war. Today, Finland and Israel have strong cultural and scientific ties, and some 10,000 Finns visit Israel every year. Economic relations In 2005, Finnish exports to Israel totaled 155.24 million euros and imports from Israel to Finland totaled 95.96 million euros. Israel imports Finnish machinery, telecommunications equipment, wood, paper products and chemical industry products. Israel's leading exports to Finland are telecommunications equipment and machinery, and Israeli fruits and vegetables.Finland‚Äôs trade relations with Israel get a new boost In 2004, a joint Finland-Israel Technology (FIT) cooperation program was created for research and development projects in the field of ICT. The Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel and Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Research and Innovation, allocated five million euros each for the funding of projects. The Finland Israel Trade association serves as an intermediary between Finnish and Israeli companies in order to create new business contacts. It helps to organize business missions to Israel and hosts business missions from Israel. In April 2019, Finland and Israel embarked on a project to sponsor joint programs in digital health and healthcare technology. The Israel Innovation Authority and the Helsinki Business Hub led the initiative. Cultural ties In 2006, an exhibition on the history of Finland's Jews from the 1830s to the 1970s opened at Beth Hatefutsoth in Tel Aviv.The unique story of Finland's Jews Military ties IMI Galil is said to have been partially based on Finnish Rk 62 assault rifle, and indeed the machinery used to manufacture the first Galils as well as receivers for the early samples were provided by Valmet. Tampella (through fully owned subsidiary Salgad) and Israeli Solel Boneh founded Soltam Systems in 1950 and started to license build Finnish designed artillery pieces and grenade launchers in Israel. It was seen as a win-win for two small and relatively poor countries with nascent defence. When two decades passed the two countries' profiles had grown apart. Amid negative publicity and dwindling domestic sales for Tampella, the ties between Salgad and Soltam were severed 15. August 1974. The FDF's LV141 and LV241 -radios have been contract-built by Tadiran for Danish Terma A/S. Spike anti-tank missiles were bought from German Rheinmetall, which subcontracted Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Rafael was also involved in FDF's LITENING AT -targeting pod purchase. Mastsystem International, current Cobham Mast Systems have been granted an export license to export some telescopic masts from Finland to Israel. The process to receive export licenses to Israel has been criticized as politically unpredictable, enough for customers to lose interest. For example, a Mastsystem International spokesperson noted in October 2010 that they were denied permit from the end of 2008 to summer 2009. In the same newspaper article a researcher noted that in 2008 Finland had also denied some export permits to Sri Lanka, Brazil and Russia. In April 2012 the FDF ordered for the Army 24 million euros worth of Orbiter II UAVs from Aeronautics Defense Systems. Their previous Swiss UAV RUAG Ranger's design was also done in Israel.

History  Giant flag of Israel The Philippines voted in favor of UN Resolution 181 recommending the partition of Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish State in 1947. The Philippines was among the 33 countries who supported the establishment of Israel and the only Asian country who voted for the resolution. Israel and the Philippines established full diplomatic relationships in 1957. Embassies were opened in Tel-Aviv and Manila in 1962. In 1997, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) institutionalizing the bilateral political dialogue between the respective foreign ministries. The political dialog is accompanied by cooperation in trade and economy, culture, technical assistance, science, academic exchanges, tourism etc. On November 28, 2007, the Knesset honored the thirty three countries which supported the UN Resolution 181 in celebration of 60th Anniversary of the State of Israel. The UN resolution, which marked January 27, as a yearly commemorative to honor the Holocaust's victims, was co-sponsored by the Philippines.

President Duterte seeks to reaffirm the people-to- people ties between the two nations based on their significant shared history. Economic relations Trade between Israel and the Philippines continues to grow but remains insignificant compared to Israel's trade industry between Europe and the Americas. Israel's exports to the Philippines remain higher in comparison to the Philippines' exports to Israel. Israeli exports amount to $248,448,918 while Filipino exports amount to $33,929,631 in 2007.

It honored the role of the Philippine Commonwealth Government under President Manuel L. Quezon in officially offering safe haven and issuing 10,000 visas to Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi regime. This was done in coordination with US Commonwealth officials (including High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt and Lt. Col. Dwight D. Eisenhower) as well as the local Jewish-Filipino community. Between 1937 and 1941, approximately 1,200 to 1,500 Jewish refugees (mostly from Germany and Austria) were settled in government-provided housing communities in Marikina. Additional plans were made to increase the visas allocated to 100,000 and to allow the refugees to resettle in the then sparsely-populated island of Mindanao, but these could not be carried out due to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941. Quezon's actions were notable because the Philippines was one of the few nations that unconditionally opened its doors to Jewish refugees. Quezon was also one of the few heads of state to openly condemn the Nazi persecution of Jews, prior to the outbreak of World War II. The Philippine Fair is an annual event in Haifa.

The diplomatic relations between the two countries were badly damaged when Sweden became the first member of the EU to recognize the state of Palestine in 2014. Previously, other members had recognized Palestine, but that was before they joined the EU.Persson, Anders (2015). ‚ÄùSweden's Recognition of Palestine: A Possible Snowball Effect?‚Äù, Palestine - Israel Journal of Politics, Economics, and Culture, Vol, 20, No. 2/3, pp: 35-41.  History  Sweden voted in favor of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine proposed by UNSCOP (chaired by Swedish lawyer Emil Sandstr√∂m) in 1947, which provided the legal foundation of the creation of the State of Israel, and offered the services of Count Folke Bernadotte, a Swedish diplomat and nephew of the then-reigning King Gustaf V of Sweden, to assist the United Nations in negotiations between Arab and Palestinian residents. The Swedish nobleman arranged a shaky truce between the new State of Israel and Arab neighbors who had mounted an attack on it in May 1948, then attempted to secure a more lasting peace. On 17 September 1948, a Zionist militant group, Lehi (group), also known as the Stern Gang, assassinated Bernadotte. The assassination was directed by Yehoshua Zettler and carried out by a four-man team led by Meshulam Makover. The fatal shots were fired by Yehoshua Cohen. The United Nations Security Council described the assassination as a \\"cowardly act which appears to have been committed by a criminal group of terrorists\\".UNSC resolution 57 (18 September 1948). Lehi saw Bernadotte as a British and Arab puppet, and thus a serious threat to the emerging State of Israel, and feared that the provisional Israeli government would accept his plan, which it considered disastrous.A.

(1995). The Stern Gang. Frank Cass. p. 267] Sweden believed that the assassination was planned by the government of Israel rather than independent terrorists and found the investigation and consequences inadequate to the crime. The police investigation was not initiated until 24 hours after the assassination, and according to Israeli historian Amitsur Ilan, the investigation was \\"amateurish.\\" It was not until 1995 that Shimon Peres officially expressed \\"regret that he was killed in a terrorist way\\". Sweden, for its part, tried to delay the admission of the state of Israel into the United Nations. Relations between Sweden and Israel remained chilled as a result of the assassination and Israel's amnesty for the perpetrators.Israel's forgotten hero: The assassination of Count Bernadotte - and the death of peace The Independent, 18 Sept 2008Israel Delivers Reply to Sweden on Bernadotte‚Äôs Assassination; Admits Police Failure JTA, 20 Jun 1950 Relations between Sweden and Israel were good during the 1950s and 1960s, during Tage Erlander's tenure as Prime Minister of Sweden. Erlander expressed strong support for Israel during the Six-Day War. Olof Palme, who succeeded Erlander as Swedish Prime Minister and leader of the Social Democratic Party in 1969, was more critical of the United States and its allies, including Israel. In 1969, the Social Democratic Party adopted a neutral stance in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict.Ahlmark 1997, p. 196. The new policy was justified by the Swedish diplomat Gunnar Jarring's position as the United Nations Secretary-General's special envoy in the conflict (the so-called Jarring Mission). In October 1973, during the Yom Kippur War, Sweden's Minister for Foreign Affairs Krister Wickman criticized Israel and said the problems in the Middle East could not be solved by military superiority. In June 1981, Sweden condemned Israel's attack on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq as a \\"clear violation of international law\\". In July 1982, after Israel's invasion of Lebanon, Prime Minister Olof Palme compared Israel's treatment of Palestinian children to Nazi Germany's treatment of Jewish children in the Nazi concentration camps and ghettos of World War II.Anf√∂rande vid TCO kongressen In December 1988, Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat visited Stockholm by invitation of the Swedish government. After two days of negotiations, Arafat announced that he would now accept Israel's right to exist and he denounced all forms of terrorism. In October 1999, Swedish Prime Minister G√∂ran Persson visited Israel, offering to broker the Middle East peace process. Persson's visit was the first official visit for a Swedish Prime Minister since Tage Erlander's visit in 1962. In January 2004, Israel's ambassador to Sweden Zvi Mazel vandalized a piece of artwork by Swedish-Israeli artist Dror Feiler on display at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, presenting a portrait of Palestinian suicide bomber Hanadi Jaradat as \\"Snow White.\\" Mazel's actions sparked a diplomatic incident between the two countries. During the 2006 Lebanon War, Minister for Foreign Affairs Jan Eliasson condemned both the actions of Hezbollah and the Israeli response . During the Gaza War in January 2009, Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt criticised Israel and called for an immediate ceasefire In August 2009, a diplomatic row erupted after the publication of an article in the Swedish daily Aftonbladet that claimed the Israel Defense Forces had engaged in organ harvesting from dead Palestinians. Israel called on the Swedish government to condemn the article, which it described as a \\"manifestation of antisemitism\\" and a modern \\"blood libel\\". The Swedish government refused, citing freedom of the press and the country's constitution. In October 2014, the newly elected Swedish Social Democratic Party-led government of Stefan L√∂fven announced it would recognize the state of Palestine saying that \\"the conflict between Israel and Palestine can only be solved with a two-state solution... A two-state solution requires mutual recognition and a will to peaceful co-existence. Sweden will therefore recognise the state of Palestine.\\" In response, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's office said that \\"he regrets that the new prime minister was in a hurry to make statements on Sweden's position regarding recognition of a Palestinian state, apparently before he had time even to study the issue in depth\\" and that the Swedish ambassador would be summoned to have a \\"conversation\\" on the issue. Lieberman also stated \\"Lofven had hastened to make declarations ... apparently before he could delve into the matter and understand it is the Palestinians who have constituted the obstacle to progress\\" in reaching a peace accord with Israel. Then he called on Lofven \\"to focus on more burning problems in the region such as the daily mass-killings going on in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere\\". Israel recalled its ambassador to Sweden, Isaac Bachman, for consultation but he returned to Sweden a month later. In December, Liberman announced his plan to boycott the visit anticipated by his Swedish counterpart, and added that, \\"Relations in the Middle East are a lot more complex than the self-assembly furniture of IKEA.\\" Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr√∂m responded to Liberman's barb with the comment, \\"I will be happy to send him a flat pack of IKEA furniture and he will also see that what you need to put that together is, first of all, a partner. And you also need to cooperate and you need a good manual and I think we have most of those elements.\\" It was announced in January 2015 that she has cancelled her visit until further notice. The purpose of the visit had been primarily to honor Raoul Wallenberg, the diplomat from Sweden who saved tens of thousands of Jews from being sent to concentration camps by issuing them Swedish papers during World War II.Swedish foreign minister cancels trip to Israel The Times of Israel, 7 Jan 2015 Commercial and trade ties The Swedish clothing chain H&M; opened its first store in Tel Aviv in 2010.

Relations between the two countries are extremely cordial, and they are known to share a Special Relationship. Both countries established diplomatic relations in May 1969. Israel has an embassy in Singapore. Singapore is represented in Israel by a non resident ambassador based in Singapore (in the Foreign Ministry) and through an honorary consulate in Tel Aviv. The two nations enjoy an extensive security relationship, with Israeli and Singaporean arms industries engaging in joint development and a large level of military trade between the two countries. History Following Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia in August 1965, Singapore established full diplomatic relations with Israel. However, Singapore kept the relationship on a low profile for the next thirty years due to its relationship with its Muslim neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia. The Singaporean government modelled the country's armed forces including its national service programme after the Israeli Defense Forces. From 1966, Israeli military advisers were brought in to assist in setting up and training the Singaporean military. Israel also supplied Singapore with military hardware including tanks and missiles. In 1968, an Israeli trade office was established in Singapore and subsequently upgraded to embassy status in 1968. In April 1986, Singapore's Foreign Minister S. Dhanabalan visited Israel. In return, the Israeli President Chaim Herzog visited Singapore in 18‚Äì19 November 1986. Herzog's visit triggered angry protests from both the Malaysian and Indonesian governments. The Malaysian government threatened to stop Singapore's water supply across the Johor‚ÄìSingapore Causeway. Despite this incident, Singaporean‚ÄìIsraeli trade relations continued to expand. By 1991, Israel's trade with Singapore totalled US$79 million in exports and US$43 million in imports. According to Jacob Adabi, Singapore sought to project an image of impartiality towards the Arab-Israeli conflict. While maintaining defense and economic relations with Israel, Singapore endorsed UN Resolutions 242 and 338 in order to balance relations with its Muslim neighbors and the Arab world. In February 2017, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara visited Singapore. He was hosted by the Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. During the visit, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke in favor of a two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Unlike the 1986 state visit, Netanyahu's presence did not attract opposition from Malaysia and Indonesia. Netanyahu also met with members of the Singaporean Jewish community and visited Maghain Aboth Synagogue. Agreements In 2005, the two countries signed a pact to ease the flow of goods and investments between the two countries during a visit to Israel by Singaporean Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong with members of the Israeli Cabinet as well as meeting Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon. In February 2017, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the first Israeli head of government to visit Singapore in 30 years. Singapore was one of 41 countries that abstained from voting on the Resolution 67/19 on ‚ÄúStatus of Palestine in the United Nations‚Äù by the United Nations General Assembly on 29 November 2012 which granted Non-Member Observer State status to Palestine. In explaining the reasons for Singapore‚Äôs abstention, Senior Minister of State Masagos Zulkifli stated that Singapore believes ‚Äúthat only a negotiated settlement consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 242 can provide the basis for a viable, long term solution‚Äù and that ‚Äú[b]oth sides have legitimate rights and shared responsibilities, and must be prepared to make compromises to achieve the larger good of a lasting peace‚Äù. Cooperation A Republic of Singapore Air Force G550 Conformal Airborne Early Warning (CAEW) aircraft. Singapore purchased four G550s from Israel Aerospace Industries fitted with the EL/W-2085 sensor package in 2007. They were delivered in late 2008 and were fully operational by late 2010. A Hanukiah honoring Singapore in Netanya, Israel Business and trade In 1990, the Singapore-Israel Chamber of Commerce commenced operation. In 2013, Singapore‚ÄìIsrael trade totalled S$1.956 billion, a 24.6% jump year-on-year from 2012, according to figures from the Embassy of Israel in Singapore and IE Singapore. Singapore is a net importer from Israel, and Israel exports mostly electrical equipment to Singapore, while Singapore exports mostly machinery and computer equipment to Israel.http://itrade.gov.il/singapore/2014/01/17/singapore-israel-trade-hits- almost-s2-billion-2013/ Military In January 1968, before diplomatic relations were established, Singapore made an agreement to purchase 72 surplus AMX-13 tanks from Israel. By the 1980s, Singapore had acquired over 350 of these tanks. During the formative years of the Singapore Armed Forces in the late 1960s, Singapore sought advice and consultation from experienced militaries to form a credible military post-independence. Israel responded and provided doctrine and training development. Due to sensitivities in a Muslim- dominant region, Singapore kept the co-operation low-profile. Over the years, Israel has continued to advise Singapore on an array of military topics, ranging from night operations to aviation psychology. The defence and intelligence establishments of both countries conduct routine exchanges of information, and a small number of IDF officers serve in staff appointments within MINDEF.Tim Huxley, Defending the Lion City: The Armed Forces of Singapore In 2012, it was reported that Singapore expressed interest in purchasing several Iron Dome defense system units and a deal took place four years later. Today, the two countries operate many of the same weapon platforms, including early warning aircraft, anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, aircraft and surveillance technologies. This is particularly true with respect to aerial systems (as the ground terrain of the two countries is very different). As such, the primary aircraft type make up of the Israeli and Singaporean air forces is nearly identical, with both countries operating the F-15E, F-16, F-35, G550 early warning aircraft, C-130 Hercules, AH-64 Apache, PC-21 and T-6 Texan basic trainers (both are advanced derivatives of the PC-7), and M-346 Master advanced training aircraft. They also operate similar submarines (larger variants of the German Type 212 submarine). Gaza The Singaporean Government has expressed concern over Palestinian rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. In January 2009, the Singapore Foreign Ministry said of the Gaza War, \\"This is an extremely disturbing development,\\" that \\"It can only exacerbate the already grave humanitarian situation.\\" Following the ceasefire, Singapore Foreign Ministry called it a \\"positive development\\" but remained \\"deeply concerned over the humanitarian situation in Gaza and urge all sides to take urgent steps to address the situation\\". In July 2014, the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement on the recent murder of the three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank. The statement said: \\"Singapore strongly condemns the killing of the three Israeli teenagers, who were first abducted on June 12, 2014. We convey our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Israel. Perpetrators of such heinous crimes must be swiftly brought to justice\\". In the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, the Minister for Foreign Affairs K. Shanmugam said the Palestinian militant organization Hamas has \\"deliberately used civilians as (human) shields\\" and was responsible for rejecting the 15 July 2014 Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire.http://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/media_centre/press_room/pr/2014/201408/press_20140508.printable.html?status=1 In the same speech to parliament, he also said that Hamas had been consistently launching rocket attacks at Israel, numbering over 2,000 missiles at one point, and this was what prompted the start of Israel's operation to destroy these rocket-launching sites, the smuggling tunnels and the munitions stockpiles to prevent attacks on Israel civilians.

The colonists were mainly members of the Unity of the Brethren (Hussites), and the town was named after their pastor, Peter Schikora, who was actively involved in the village's establishment. In 1841 a Protestant school opened, which was replaced by a new building in 1882, and in 1892 the first Protestant church was built. In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of March 1921, 639 villagers voted to remain in Germany and 169 voted to join the newly created Second Polish Republic. As a result, Petersgr√§tz remained as a village of the Weimar Republic. In 1945, the Red Army occupied the village and drove a large part of its population out. The town was first renamed Piotrogr√≥d, then later Piotr√≥wka. The Protestant church was converted into a Catholic church, and in 1946 a separate parish was formed for the village. In 2006 the village was declared bilingual in German and Polish, and in 2008 the original German name of Petersgr√§tz was again made official.

History Foreign Minister Golda Meir presenting an ambulance as a gift to people of Kenya, 1963 Early years Starting in 1903, under the British Uganda Programme, territory in what was then Uganda, but is now part of Kenya, was offered as a Jewish homeland. 1962‚Äì75 Kenyan politician Tom Mboya, Secretary-General of the Kenya African National Union, meets with Israeli Histadrut Secretary General Aharon Becker (January 1962) Levi Eshkol and Jomo Kenyatta In January 1962, Kenyan politician Tom Mboya, Secretary-General of the Kenya African National Union, met with Israeli Histadrut Secretary General Aharon Becker. In December 1963 Golda Meir, then Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, met with Kenyan Prime Minister Jomo Kenyatta. On that trip Meir and Kenyatta laid the cornerstone for the Israeli Embassy in Nairobi. Israel agreed to train Kenyans in agriculture and medicine in a program called Mashav, in which trainees from Kenya were flown to Israel for study. In 1966, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol visited Kenya and met with President Kenyatta. In 1973, diplomatic ties were severed following the Yom Kippur War. 1976‚Äì86 Kenyan government official Bruce McKenzie persuaded Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta to allow Mossad agents to gather information prior to Operation Entebbe in 1976. Also, the Israeli Air Force was granted permission to use an airport in Nairobi. Ugandan President Idi Amin later ordered McKenzie's assassination. Mossad Chief Director Meir Amit had a forest planted in Israel in McKenzie‚Äôs name. In 1979, Abdalla Mwidau, the representative of Mombasa-South in the Kenyan parliament, conducted an information campaign among Muslims in the USA, in which he praised Israel's assistance to developing African countries and specifically its assistance to Muslim education in Kenya. His political rivals, led by Sharif Kassir, denounced these activities, calling Mwidau a \\"Zionist agent\\".Arye Oded. Islam and politics in Kenya. p. 129. Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2000 1987‚Äì2001 Renewed diplomatic ties were discussed in 1987 with the Kenyan President Daniel Moi by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, and were re-initiated in 1988. In 1989 Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens visited Kenya to sign a cooperation pact. The Kibwezi irrigation project of 1991 was a joint effort between the two countries. In 1996 it consisted of 40 hectares of experimental irrigation farm in the Yatta plateau. 2002‚Äìpresent Uhuru Kenyatta in Israel with the president of Israel Reuven Rivlin, February 2016 During the 2002 Mombasa attacks, suicide-bomber terrorists struck the entrance of the Israeli-owned Paradise Hotel. Fifteen people were killed, three of them Israelis, when a car bomb exploded outside the lobby of the hotel. Terrorists also fired two hand-held rockets at an Israeli airliner, which had just lifted off from Moi International Airport in Mombasa with 264 passengers on board. Israel then evacuated its citizens from Kenya. In 2003, Kenya requested Israel's help in developing a national solar energy strategy. Roads, Public Works and Housing Minister Raila Odinga said: \\"Israel has a Solar Energy Standards Committee dealing with the setting up of solar energy equipment around the world and we need their help in setting up such equipment in Kenya.\\" While speaking during an audience with the new Israeli Ambassador to Kenya, Emmanuel Seri, Raila also reiterated the need to enhance the existing economic ties between the two countries and asked Israel to provide more development aid and to help Kenya draw up and execute an effective national disaster management scheme. Seri told the Kenyan minister that his government intended to enhance the existing economic ties, saying \\"[w]e want to enhance our trade relations with Kenya so that more Kenyans can visit Israel and do business.\\" In 2006, Israel sent a search-and-rescue team to Kenya when a building collapsed. Eighty disaster and medical relief people left Tel Aviv for Nairobi, where people were trapped in rubble when a multistory building collapsed. Following the Kenyan presidential election, 2007, there was rioting, and Israel came to the aid of Kenyans by donating medicine to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. In 2010, Kenya began seeking the purchase of Israeli weapons, likely to include counterinsurgency systems and unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance. In 2011, the two countries signed a treaty to cooperate in fighting against terrorism, money laundering, and other crime. In 2013, Israel sent troops to give assistance to Kenyan forces fighting Somali Islamist terrorists who attacked the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi. Israeli agencies helped Kenya investigate the attack, which killed at least 72 people.  Trade relations  Between 1970 and 1973, Israeli exports to Kenya were in the range of $2.8‚Äì4.2 million. Kenyan exports to Israel over the same period were in the range of $1.0‚Äì1.7 million. By 2011, according to figures released by Kenyan trade minister Ali Mwakwere, trade between the two nations had grown to $150 million, with Israel exporting finished goods such as agricultural machinery, irrigation equipment and medicine to Kenya and Kenya exporting primary products such as food products and materials to Israel. Trade between the two countries was $139 million in 2012, 8.0 percent of Israel's trade with Africa.

It is characterized by a tight vesicle-calcium channel coupling that promotes rapid neurotransmitter release and sustained signal transmission. Ribbon synapses undergo a cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis in response to graded changes of membrane potential. It has been proposed that most ribbon synapses undergo a special type of exocytosis based on coordinated multivesicular release. This interpretation has recently been questioned at the inner hair cell ribbon synapse, where it has been instead proposed that exocytosis is described by uniquantal (i.e., univesicular) release shaped by a flickering vesicle fusion pore. These unique features specialize the ribbon synapse to enable extremely fast, precise and sustained neurotransmission, which is critical for the perception of complex senses such as vision and hearing. Ribbon synapses are found in retinal photoreceptor cells, vestibular organ receptors, cochlear hair cells, retinal bipolar cells, and pinealocytes. The synaptic ribbon is a unique structure at the active zone of the synapse. It is positioned several nanometers away from the pre-synaptic membrane and tethers 100 or more synaptic vesicles. Each pre-synaptic cell can have from 10 to 100 ribbons tethered at the membrane, or a total number of 1000‚Äì10000 vesicles in close proximity to active zones. The ribbon synapse was first identified in the retina as a thin, ribbon-like presynaptic projection surrounded by a halo of vesicles using transmission electron microscopy in the 1950s, as the technique was gaining mainstream usage. Structure Microscopic The photoreceptor ribbon synapse is around 30 nm in thickness. It sticks out into the cytoplasm around 200-1000 nm and anchors along its base to the arciform density which is an electron dense structure that is anchored to the presynaptic membrane. The arciform density is located within the synaptic ridge, a small evagination of the presynaptic membrane. Hair cells lack an arciform density so the anchor of this ribbon is considered to be invisible by electron microscope. The ribbon's surface has small particles that are around 5 nm wide where the synaptic vesicles tether densely via fine protein filaments. There are multiple filaments per vesicle. There are also voltage gated L-type calcium channels on the docking sites of the ribbon synapse which trigger neurotransmitter release. Specifically, ribbon synapses contain specialized organelles called synaptic ribbons, which are large presynaptic structures associated in the active zone. They are thought to fine-tune the synaptic vesicle cycle. Synaptic ribbons are in close proximity to synaptic vesicles, which, in turn, are close to the presynaptic neurotransmitter release site via the ribbon. Postsynaptic structures differ for cochlear cells and photoreceptor cells. Hair cells is capable of one action potential propagation for one vesicle release. One vesicle release from the presynaptic hair cell onto the postsynaptic bouton is enough to create an action potential in the auditory afferent cells. Photoreceptors allow one vesicle release for many action potential propagation. The rod terminal and cone ribbon synapse of the photoreceptors have horizontal synaptic spines expressing AMPA receptors with additional bipolar dendrites exhibiting the mGluR6 receptors. These structures allow for the binding of multiple molecules of glutamate, allowing for the propagation of many action potentials. Molecular The molecular composition between conventional neuronal synapse and ribbon synapse is surprisingly dissimilar. At the core of synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery in vertebrate neuronal synapses is the SNARE complex. The minimally functional SNARE complex includes syntaxin 1, VAMP 1 and 2, and SNAP-25. In contrast, genetic ablation or application of botulinum, targeting SNAP-25, syntaxin 1-3, and VAMP 1-3, did not affect inner hair cell ribbon synapse exocytosis in mice. Additionally, no neuronal SNAREs were observed in hair cells using immunostaining, pointing to the possibility of a different exocytosis mechanism. However, several studies found SNARE mRNA and protein expressed in hair cell, perhaps indicating presence of a neuronal SNARE complex in ribbon synapse that is present in low levels and with very redundant components. Several proteins of the synaptic ribbon have also been found to be associated with conventional synapses. RIM (Rab3-interacting proteins) is a GTPase expressed on synaptic vesicles that is important in priming synaptic vesicles. Immunostaining has revealed the presence of KIF3A, a component of the kinesin II motor complex whose function is still unknown. The presynaptic cytomatrix proteins Bassoon and Piccolo are both expressed at photoreceptor ribbons, but Piccolo is only expressed at retinal bipolar synaptic ribbons. Bassoon is responsible for attaching itself to the base of the synaptic ribbons and subsequently anchoring the synaptic ribbons. The function of Piccolo is unknown. Also important is the filaments that tether the vesicles to the ribbon synapse. These are shed during high rates of exocytosis. The only unique protein associated with the synaptic ribbon is RIBEYE, first identified in purified synaptic ribbon from bovine retina. It is found to be a part of all vertebrate synaptic ribbons in ribbon synapses and is the central portion of ribbon synapses. RIBEYE interactions are required to form a scaffold formation protein of the synaptic ribbon. There has been a significant amount of research into the pre-synaptic cytomatrix protein Bassoon, which is a multi-domain scaffolding protein universally expressed at synapses in the central nervous system. Mutations in Bassoon have been shown to result in decreased synaptic transmission. However, the underlying mechanisms behind this observed phenomenon are not fully understood and are currently being investigated. It has been observed that in the retina of Bassoon-mutant mice, photoreceptor ribbon synapses are not anchored to pre- synaptic active zones during photoreceptor synaptogenesis. The photoreceptor ribbon synapses are observed to be free floating in the cytoplasm of the photoreceptor terminals. These observations have led to the conclusion that Bassoon plays a critical role in the formation of the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. Structural plasticity In correspondence to its activity, ribbon synapses can have synaptic ribbons that vary in size. In mouse photoreceptor synapses when the neurotransmitter release rate is high and exocytosis is high, the synaptic ribbons are long. When neurotransmitter release rate is low and exocytosis is low, the synaptic ribbons are short. A current hypothesis is that synaptic ribbons can enlarge by the addition of more RIBEYE subunit. Function Features of the ribbon synapse enable it to process information extremely quickly. Bipolar neurons present a good model for how ribbon synapses function. Information is conveyed from photoreceptor cells to bipolar cells via the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate at the ribbon synapse. Conventional neurons encode information by changes in the rate of action potentials, but for complex senses like vision, this is not sufficient. Ribbon synapses enable neurons to transmit light signals over a dynamic range of several orders of magnitude in intensity. This is achieved by encoding intensity changes in tonic rate of transmitter release which requires the release of several hundred to several thousand synaptic vesicles per second. To accomplish this level of performance, the sensory neurons of the eye maintain large pools of fast releasable vesicles that are equipped with ribbon synapses. This enables the cell to exocytose hundreds of vesicles per second, greatly exceeding the rate of neurons without the specialized ribbon synapse. The current hypothesis of calcium-dependent exocytosis at retinal ribbon synapses suggests that the ribbon accommodates a reservoir of primed releasable vesicles. The vesicles that are in closest contact with the presynaptic plasma membrane at the base of the ribbon constitute the small, rapidly releasable pool of vesicles, whereas the remaining vesicles tethered to the ribbon constitute the large, readily (slower) releasable pool. These regularly aligned rows of synaptic vesicles tethered to either side of the ribbon along with the expression of the kinesin motor protein KIF3A at retinal ribbon synapses can move vesicles like a conveyor belt to the docking/release site at the ribbon base. Exocytosis During exocytosis at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles are seen to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity in the absence of stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore. The bipolar cell active zone of the ribbon synapse can release neurotransmitter continuously for hundreds of milliseconds during strong stimulation. This release of neurotransmitters occurs in two kinetically distinct phases: a small fast pool where about twenty percent of the total is released in about 1 millisecond, and a large sustained pool where the remaining components are released over hundreds of milliseconds. The existence of correspondence between the pool of tethered vesicles and the pool for sustained release in the rods and bipolar cells of the ribbon reveals that the ribbon may serve as a platform where the vesicles can be primed to allow sustained release of neurotransmitters. This large size of the sustained large component is what separates the ribbon synapse active zones from those of conventional neurons where sustained release is small in comparison. Once the presynaptic vesicles have been depleted, the bipolar cell's releasable pool requires several seconds to refill with the help of ATP hydrolysis. Endocytosis A high rate of endocytosis is necessary to counter the high rate of exocytosis during sustained neurotransmitter release at ribbon synapses. Synaptic vesicles need to be recycled for further transmission to occur. These vesicles are directly recycled and because of their mobility, quickly replenish the neurotransmitters required for continued release. In cone photoreceptors, the fused membrane is recycled into the synaptic vesicle without pooling of the membrane into the endosomes. Bipolar cells rely on a different mechanism. It involves taking a large portion of the membrane which is endocytosed and gives rise to synaptic vesicles. This mechanism is conserved in hair cells as well. Research Loss of hearing and sight in mice Research has shown that abnormal expression of otoferlin, a ribbon synapse associated protein, impairs exocytosis of ribbon-bound vesicles in auditory inner hair cells. Otoferlin displays similar functional characteristics to synaptotagmin, a synapse associated protein important for mediating exocytosis in many other synapses (such as those in the central nervous system). Impaired hearing in mice has been shown to be associated with disrupted expression of otoferlin. In studies of retinal genetic coding of laboratory mice, several mutated ribbon synapse associated voltage-gated L-type calcium channel auxiliary subunits were shown to be associated with dysfunctional rod and cone activity and information transmission. Mice were shown to express significantly reduced scotopic vision, and further research has shown the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis may have a significant role in rod photoreceptor degradation and death. Human implications Much of the genetic information associated with the proteins observed in laboratory mice are shared with humans. The protein otoferlin is observed phenotypically in human auditory inner hair cells, and abnormal expression has been linked with deafness. In humans, cochlear implants have shown to reduce the debilitating effects of abnormal otoferlin expression by surpassing the synapse associated with the auditory inner hair cells. The genetic code for retinal subunits associated with impaired scotopic vision and rod photoreceptor degradation are conserved at approximately 93% between mice and humans. Further research into the abnormal functioning of these mechanisms could open the door to therapeutic techniques to relieve auditory and visual impairments. Other areas Several recent studies have provided evidence that loss-of-function mutations in pre-synaptic proteins of the photoreceptor cells ribbon synapse can cause X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) through mutations in the CACNA1F gene, which codes for the Œ±F1-subunit of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.4. The gene is expressed at the active zone of photoreceptor ribbon synapses. The mutation is characterized by a significant reduction in both night and variable perturbation of daylight vision. The mutations in CACNA1F and Cav1.4 have also been observed to co- localize with CaBP4, a photoreceptor-specific calcium-binding protein. CaBP4 has been theorized to modulate the activity of the Cav1.4 channel. It has been theorized to be associated with the proper establishment and maintenance of photoreceptor ribbon synapses. While no evidence has been published, the association between CaBP4 and Cav1.4 is an area of continued research.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, Israel played a significant role in the development of Sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria. Hundreds of Israeli experts and volunteers were sent to help in the development and modernization of agriculture, education, medicine and technology training. Israeli Moshe \\"Jerry\\" Beit Halevi was Nigeria's first football coach following independence. His spell reflected the close ties between Nigeria's Southern and the Western regions with Israel, alongside the tensions between Nigeria's Northern region with Israel. The coverage of his games in the press reflected the deep divisions that plagued Nigeria during the first republic. At the same time, hundreds of Nigerian farmers, experts, educators, academicians, students, doctors, community workers and engineers were trained in Israel. After the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Nigeria severed diplomatic ties with Israel. Diplomatic relations were restored in September 1992. Since April 1993, Israel has maintained an embassy in Abuja and Nigeria has an embassy in Tel Aviv. Over fifty Israeli companies operate in Nigeria in the spheres of construction, infrastructure, hi-tech, communications and IT, agriculture and water management. In turn, there are over 5,000 Nigerian companies and organizations that operate in Israel. Trade and commerce are promoted by the Israeli Export and International Cooperation Institute, the Nigerian-Israeli Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and the Israel-Africa Chamber of Commerce. In 2006, a Nigerian-Israeli Business Forum was inaugurated in Abuja. That year, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in which Israel and Nigeria agreed to consult on issues of bilateral relations and other regional and international issues of mutual interest.

He was born in Baltimore, Maryland and died at the age of 65 in Omaha, Nebraska. Career Dolan played a total of 18 seasons including over 1,300 games in the minor leagues mostly at the Class A and D levels. Since Major League teams didn't begin affiliating league-wide with minor leagues teams until 1932, Dolan signed various contracts as a free agent with the Louisville Colonels (1896‚Äì97), Philadelphia Phillies (1899-1901), and Philadelphia Athletics (1901). Although he'd play in 11 different minor league cities, he spent the bulk of his time, seven seasons, in Omaha where he also made his home after retiring. Interestingly, Omaha had no fewer than four nicknames during this time including the Omahogs, Indians, Rangers, and Rourkes. After taking off a few years from baseball (he had retired in 1910), Dolan played one more season in 1913 for the Bangor Maroons at age 40. He batted .267 in 64 games (it was a 66-game season), but the league in which he played, the New Brunswick-Maine League, folded after only one season.

Some CHANTs were adapted to carry dry cargos. These were known as the Empire F type coasters. Although five CHANTs were lost during the war, the majority of the ships saw service post war, lasting into the 1990s. Design The CHANT was developed with experience gained by building the Tug, Inshore and Dock (TID). As with the TIDs, CHANTs were built from prefabricated sections which were manufactured at various factories across the United Kingdom. A total of twenty-eight sections made up into a ship. The largest sections weighed thirteen tons which enabled them to be delivered by road. To simplify construction, they were built without compound curves. All plates being either flat or curved in one direction only, with the exception of the skeg at the stern. All joints were welded, with the final being left unwelded at the factory to enable final adjustment at joints when the ship was assembled by the shipyard. CHANTs were designed with a flat bottom to enable them to ground on beaches. A double hull was used to minimise any chance of leakage. Each CHANT had four sub-divided tanks and was fitted with one single mast with two derricks and winches. They were not the most stable of ships, and needed to carry plenty of ballast. CHANTs were assembled at five different shipyards, and launched between February and May 1944. Some cargo version (Empire-F type) were built with a \\"Chant\\" prefix name which add some confusion about the real type of vessel (i.e.CHANT 41, CHANT 14, CHANT 39, and CHANT 49 were all Empire-F type despite their initial names. The cargo version were double bottom but single side. They had two holds and two hatches. Instead of one single mast in the middle like for the Chant version, the Empire version had two mast (fore and aft) and two 1.5 tons derricks. Four Empire-F sold to Canadian owners were modified in order to have a single hold and a single hatch. The trunk on hold number 2 was therefore eliminated. Builders H Scarr, Hessle Henry Scarr Ltd, Hessle, Yorkshire built twelve CHANTs. They were named CHANT 1 to CHANT 12 inclusive. A further twelve ships were completed as \\"Empire F type\\" coasters. Goole Shipbuilding & Repairing Goole Shipbuilding & Repairing Co Ltd, Goole, Yorkshire built nine CHANTs. They were named CHANT 22 to CHANT 28, CHANT 50 and CHANT 51. A further thirteen ships were completed as \\"Empire F type\\" coasters. Furness Shipbuilding, Haverton Hill-on-Tees Furness Shipbuilding Co Ltd, at Haverton Hill shipyard, Haverton Hill-on-Tees, Co Durham built sixteen CHANTs. They were named CHANT 42 to CHANT 45 and CHANT 52 to CHANT 65. J Readhead & Sons, South Shields J Readhead & Sons Ltd, South Shields, Co Durham built only two CHANTs; CHANT 60 and CHANT 61. Burntisland Shipbuilding Burntisland Shipbuilding Company Ltd, Burntisland, Fife built four CHANTS; CHANT 66 to CHANT 69. Empire F type coasters The Empire F type coasters were a dry cargo version of the CHANT tankers. Due to the success of Operation Pluto, which put a fuel pipeline between the English and French coasts, the demand for CHANTs was not as high as had been thought initially. Although of the same dimensions as the CHANTS, the Empire Fs were 410-411 GRT and 460 DWT. They were driven by diesel engines of and could make . A total of twenty five were built. They were renamed with the prefix \\"Fabric\\" instead of \\"CHANT\\" while still under construction. All were renamed again before launch, carrying the \\"Empire\\" prefix and had a suffix beginning with \\"F\\". They were built by H Scarr Ltd, Hessle and Goole Shibuilding & Engineering Ltd, Goole. Built by H Scarr The twelve Empire F type coasters were originally to have been named CHANT 14 to CHANT 17, CHANT 20, CHANT 21, and CHANT 46 to CHANT 49. Renamed with the prefix Empire, they served as Empire Fabric, Empire Fabian, Empire Fable, Empire Farringdon, Empire Fanfare, Empire Faversham, Empire Facility, Empire Faraway, Empire Fanal, Empire Fastness, Empire Farrier and Empire Fathom. Built by Goole Shipbuilding The thirteen Empire F type coasters built at Goole were originally to have been CHANT 29 to CHANT 41. They were renamed with the prefix Empire. They became Empire Factor, Empire Fairhaven, Empire Favourite, Empire Fashion, Empire Fans, Empire Farnham, Empire Farouche, Empire Farringay, Empire Farjeon, Empire Facet, Empire Fang, Empire Fairplay and Empire Fairway. D-Day CHANTs were built to provide supplies of fuel to the Allied Forces in the aftermath of D-Day. Three CHANTs capsized during June 1944 and it was decided to use the Gooseberrys until stability tests had been carried out. CHANT 23 was disabled by a shell in her engine room but continued to refuel other ships. CHANT 26 was driven ashore on a large wave and ended up in a field having passed through a hedge. After discharging her cargo she was dragged back to the beach, refloated and towed back to the UK.

Retrieved on 13 February 2009. there have been complaints of restriction or discrimination against women who wear the hijab. The hijab in these cases is seen as a sign of political Islam or fundamentalism against secular government. Islamic dress, notably the variety of headdresses worn by Muslim women, has become a prominent symbol of the presence of Islam in western Europe. In several countries, this adherence to hijab has led to political controversies and proposals for a legal ban. Laws have been passed in France and Belgium to ban face-covering clothing, popularly described as the \\"burqa ban\\", although it does not only apply to the Afghan-model burqa. Other countries are debating similar legislation, or have more limited prohibitions. Some of them apply only to face-covering clothing such as the burqa, boushiya, or niqƒÅb, while other legislation pertains to any clothing with an Islamic religious symbolism such as the khimar, a type of headscarf. Some countries already have laws banning the wearing of masks in public, which can be applied to veils that conceal the face. The issue has different names in different countries, and \\"the veil\\" or hijab may be used as general terms for the debate, representing more than just the veil itself, or the concept of modesty embodied in hijab. Although the Balkans and Eastern Europe have Muslim populations, most Muslims in western Europe are members of immigrant communities. The issue of Islamic dress is linked with issues of immigration and the position of Islam in Western Europe. There are currently 16 nations that have banned the burqa (not to be confused with the hijab), including Tunisia, Austria, Denmark, France, Belgium, Tajikistan, Latvia, Bulgaria,Bulgaria the latest European country to ban the burqa and [niqab in public places, Smh.com.au: accessed 5 December 2016.

Map current as of 2019 European Commissioner Franco Frattini said in November 2006, that he did not favour a ban on the burqa.Reformatorisch dagblad: Brussel tegen boerkaverbod , 30 November 2006. This is apparently the first official statement on the issue of prohibition of Islamic dress from the European Commission, the executive of the European Union. Islamic dress is also seen as a symbol of the existence of parallel societies, and the failure of integration: in 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the face veil as a \\"mark of separation\\".Blair's concerns over face veils BBC News Online. 17 October 2006. Proposals to ban hijab may be linked to other related cultural prohibitions, with Dutch politician Geert Wilders proposing a ban on hijab, on Islamic schools, the Quran, on new mosques, and on non-western immigration. In France and Turkey, the emphasis is on the secular nature of the state, and the symbolic nature of the Islamic dress. In Turkey, bans previously applied at state institutions (courts, civil service) and in state-funded education, but were progressively lifted during the tenure of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. In 2004, France passed a law banning \\"symbols or clothes through which students conspicuously display their religious affiliation\\" (including hijab) in public primary schools, middle schools, and secondary schools,French MPs back headscarf ban BBC News (BBC). Retrieved on 13 February 2009. but this law does not concern universities (in French universities, applicable legislation grants students freedom of expression as long as public order is preserved). These bans also cover Islamic headscarves, which in some other countries are seen as less controversial, although law court staff in the Netherlands are also forbidden to wear Islamic headscarves on grounds of 'state neutrality'. An apparently less politicised argument is that in specific professions (teaching), a ban on \\"veils\\" (niqab) may be justified on the grounds that being able to see facial expressions and making eye contact can be helpful in communicating. This argument has featured prominently in judgments in Britain and the Netherlands, after students or teachers were banned from wearing face-covering clothing. Public and political response to such prohibition proposals is complex, since by definition they mean that the government decides on individual clothing. Some non-Muslims, who would not be affected by a ban, see it as an issue of civil liberties, as a slippery slope leading to further restrictions on private life. A public opinion poll in London showed that 75 percent of Londoners support \\"the right of all persons to dress in accordance with their religious beliefs\\".Guardian: Livingstone decries vilification of Islam, 20 November 2006. In another poll in the United Kingdom by Ipsos MORI, 61 percent agreed that \\"Muslim women are segregating themselves\\" by wearing a veil, yet 77 percent thought they should have the right to wear it.Ipsos MORI Muslim Women Wearing Veils . In a later FT-Harris poll conducted in 2010 after the French ban on face-covering went into effect, an overwhelming majority in Italy, Spain, Germany and the UK supported passing such bans in their own countries. The headscarf is perceived to be a symbol of the clash of civilizations by many. Others would also argue that the increase of laws surrounding the banning of headscarves and other religious paraphernalia has led to an increase in not just the sales of headscarves and niqabs, but an increase in the current religiosity of the Muslim population in Europe: as both a product of and a reaction to westernization.Scott, 2007, pg. 5 According to a ruling by the European Court of Justice in a case involving two Belgian women, employers in the EU may restrict the wearing of religious symbos if such regulations on appearance are applied in a consistent manner.  Austria  \\"Liebende Eltern (Loving parents)\\", painting about the discussion about the face-covering clothing, showing Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, vice chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache and a little muslim child by Matthias Laurenz Gr√§ff (2018) In 2017, a legal ban on face-covering clothing was adopted by the Austrian parliament. Headscarves were also banned in 2019 from primary schools. In 2019, Austria banned the hijab in schools for children up to ten years of age. The Austrian legislators said their motivation was promoting equality between men and women and improving social integration with respect to local customs. Parents who send their child to school with a headscarf will be fined 440 euro.  Belgium  As of 2015, Belgium has specific bans on face-covering dress, such as the niqab or burqa. On Tuesday 11 July 2017 the European Court of Human Rights upheld Belgium's ban on burqas and full-face veils.Independent https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belgium-burqa-ban-upheld- european-court-of-human-rights-dakir-v-full-face-islamic-veils- headscarf-a7835156.html]  Bulgaria  Pomak women in Bulgaria In 2016, a ban on the wearing of face-covering clothing in public was adopted by the Bulgarian parliament.Bulgaria the latest European country to ban the burqa and niqab in public places, Smh.com.au: accessed 5 December 2016. The Bulgarian parliament enacted the ban on the basis of security concerns, however the ban stimulated conflict as 10 percent of the country's population identifies as Muslim. Women who violate the burqa ban face fines up to ‚Ç¨770 (~US$848) and have their social security benefits suspended.  Denmark  In autumn 2017, the Danish government considered adopting a law prohibiting people to wear \\"attire and clothing masking the face in such a way that it impairs recognizability\\". The proposal was met with support from the three largest political partiesL 219 Forslag til lov om √¶ndring af straffeloven., Folketinget and was passed into law on 31 May 2018, becoming ¬ß 134 c of the Danish Penal Code, stating that \\"[a]ny person who in a public place wears a item of clothing that covers said person's face shall be liable to a fine\\" with an exception for coverings that serve \\"a creditable purpose\\" (e.g. sports equipment, protection against the cold, masks for carnivals, masquerades etc.). The law came into force on 1 August 2018. On the first day of the implementation of the burqa ban, hundreds of protesters rallied wearing face veils in public. According to the ban, wearing a burqa or a niqab in public can lead to a fine of 1000 kroner (~US$156) in case of first time offences, rising to 10,000 kr. (~US$1560) in case of the fourth offence. Under the ban, police are instructed to order women to remove their veils or to leave the public space. Police officers that fail to obey the orders of the ban are subject to be fined.  France  France is a secular country. One of the key principles of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the freedom of religious exercise. At the same time, this law prohibited public servants from wearing any religious signs during work. In 1994, the French Ministry for Education sent out recommendations to teachers and headmasters to ban Islamic veil in educational institutions. According to a 2019 study by the Institute of Labor Economics, more girls with a Muslim background born after 1980 graduated from high school after the 1994 restrictions were introduced. While secularism is often criticized for restricting freedom of religion, the study suggested that \\"public schools ended up promoting the educational empowerment of some of the most disadvantaged groups of female students\\". In 2004, the French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools banned most religious signs, including the hijab, from public primary and secondary schools in France. The proposed ban was extremely controversial, with both sides of the political spectrum being split on the issue, some people arguing that the law goes against religious freedom and is racist because it affects mostly Muslim women and Jewish men. In 2010, a ban on face covering, targeting especially women wearing chador and burqa, was adopted by the French Parliament. According to the Guardian, the \\"Burqa ban\\", was challenged and taken to the European Court of Human Rights which upheld the law on 1 July 2014, accepting the argument of the French government that the law was based on \\"a certain idea of living together\\". In 2013 \\"the applicant\\" stood outside Elys√©e Palace in niqab and subsequently received a criminal conviction. The French criminal courts noted in 2014 that the lower court was wrong to dismiss her rights covered under article 18 but dismissed her appeal. The French delegation argued that wearing face coverings violated the principle of \\"living together\\". Judges Angelika Nussberger and Helena J√§derblom dissented, calling the concept, \\"far-fetched and vague.\\" Going on to note that the very decision of declaring what a woman is allowed to wear was hypocritical and antithetical to the aim of protecting human rights. The committee came to the determination in 2018 that the case had been incorrectly dismissed after review by a single judge on the grounds that, \\"the conditions of admissibility laid down in articles 34 and 35 of the Convention [had] not been met.\\" Upon review the committee concluded that the applicants's human rights had been violated under article 18 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The committee dismissed the notion of \\"living together\\" as a vague notion not protected under international law. A broader ban on hijab is regularly proposed by conservative and right-wing politicians. Such a broader ban would include a ban in public universities but presidents of universities and most student unions oppose such a ban.  Germany  In 2017, a ban on face- covering clothing for soldiers and state workers during work was approved by German parliament. Due to rapid demographic changes in Germany following immigration from Muslim countries, public debates ensued which among other topics concerned Islamic veils from the turn of the century onwards. In 2019 Susanne Schr√∂ter, an academic at Goethe University Frankfurt planned a conference titled \\"The Islamic veil ‚Äì Symbol of dignity or oppression?\\" which led to a group of students protesting that value judgments on the veil should not be made. The protestors criticized the invitation of journalist Alice Schwarzer and publisher of feminist magazine EMMA. Schr√∂ter is a noted critic of Islamic veils and argues that the veil restricts a woman's freedom and usually comes with a bundle of restrictions. Schr√∂ter was backed by the president of Frankfurt University who stressed that it is her job to organize academic conferences where diverse opinions can be voiced. The president of the argued that freedom of speech meant that controversial topics should be resolved by debate, not \\"boycotts, mobbing or violence\\". Members of the Uni gegen antimuslimischen Rassismus (English: \\"University against anti-Muslim racism\\") boycotted the conference due to their objections regarding the invited participants. Ireland In 2018, the prime minister Leo Varadkar ruled out a burka ban in Ireland, saying \\"I don‚Äôt like it but I think people are entitled to wear what they want to wear.

However it is guaranteed that individuals are allowed to wear as they wish at their private homes and at the Mosque. Imam El Sadi, from Mariam Al-Batool Mosque, has said that the banning of the niqab and the burka \\"offends Muslim women\\". El Sadi said that the Maltese's \\"attitude towards Muslim women\\" is positive and despite cultural clashes their dressing is tolerated.

Netherlands  The States General of the Netherlands enacted a ban on face-covering clothing, popularly described as the \\"burqa ban\\", in January 2012.\\"Ministers vote Dutch ‚Äòburqa ban‚Äô\\", rnw.nlThe Telegraph \\"Netherlands to ban the burka\\", 15 September 2011 The burqa ban came into force on 1 August 2019 in schools, public transport, hospitals and government buildings, but there are doubts over whether it will be applied in practice.The Netherlands has introduced a 'burqa ban' ‚Äì but its enforcement is in doubt, CNN, 1 August 2019 Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema spoke out in her opposition of the law. She stated that removing someone wearing a burqa from public transport in the capital would not be fitting with current Dutch society. Chairman of the Dutch Public Transport Association Pedro Peters also voiced his opinion on the ban. Peters said: \\"You are not going to stop the bus for half an hour for someone wearing a burqa\\", waiting for the police to arrive; \\"we are also not allowed to refuse anyone because we have a transport obligation\\". Known officially as the Partial Ban on Face-Covering Clothing Act, the act also details that those who refuse to uncover their faces may pay a fine of at least 150 euros and can be arrested. Dutch police have also stated that enforcing the ban is not a priority, and that they likely would not respond to a complaint within a thirty-minute timeframe. The Dutch government has also come under fire for the \\"burqa ban\\" from certain members of the UN claiming it is discriminatory towards Muslim women. On 7 October 2019 Tendayi Achiume, The United Nations Special Rapporteur on racism, wrote a report questioning the perceived inclusivity of Dutch society and how that perception masks a reality of treating racial and ethnic minorities as foreign. Speaking about the \\"burqa ban\\" Achiume said \\"The political debate surrounding the adoption of this law makes plain its intended targeting of Muslim women, and even if this targeting was not the intent, it has certainly been the effect\\". In her report Achiume also reference a whistleblower in the Hague police department. She said that this whisleblower raised concerns about a culture of racism and targeted discrimination within the police department, and the government must act quickly to combat it.  Norway  In 2018 the Norwegian parliament voted to ban the burqa in schools and universities. In April 2019, the Telia telecom company received bomb threats after featuring a Muslim woman taking off her hijab in a commercial. Although the police did not evaluate the threat as likely to be carried out, delivering threats is still a crime in Norway.  Poland  Traditionally Muslim Lipka Tatar women did not wear the hijab, making the visibility of Muslim women in Polish society a recent trend. This visibility has made Muslim women targets of Polish Islamophobia by two camps: a right-wing Catholic camp and a secular liberal camp. While these two camps share little in common value, the Islamophobic expression towards the bodies of Muslim women is shared, both camps stating that Muslim women face oppression.Narkowicz, Kasia, and Konrad Pƒôdziwiatr. \\"Saving and fearing Muslim women in ‚Äòpost-communist‚ÄôPoland: troubling Catholic and secular Islamophobia\\" Gender, Place & Culture 24.2 (2017): 288‚Äì299.  Sweden  In December 2019, the municipality of Skurup banned Islamic veils in educational institutions. Earlier, the municipality of Staffanstorp approved a similar ban.  Switzerland  In September 2013, a constitutional referendum in the Canton of Ticino on a popular initiative banning full-face veils was approved with 66.2% of the vote. In May 2017, the Landsgemeinde in the Canton of Glarus rejected adopting a similar measure with about two-thirds of the vote. On the federal level, a popular initiative is still pending as of May 2020.  United Kingdom  The UK has no specific legislation prohibiting any form of traditional Islamic dress. In some cases, hijabs are worn by young girls from age 6‚Äì8. According to retail chain Marks & Spencer, the hijabs they sell as part of the school uniform will fit a child aged 3. Muslim world Dress codes for women in Muslim countries Algeria In 2018, the government passed a law banning the wearing of full face-veils, called burqas or niqabs, for women at work. The 2018 Prime Minister, Ahmed Ouahiya, pushed the ban because of his belief that women should be identifiable in the workspace. Afghanistan Female art students in Afghanistan There is no legal hijab enforcement in Afghanistan, but it is predominantly worn largely due to cultural pressure. In the mid-20th century many women in urban areas did not wear head covering, but this ended with the outbreak of civil war in the 1990s. The Afghan chadri is a regional style of burqa with a mesh covering the eyes. It has been worn by Pashtun women since pre-Islamic times and was historically seen as a mark of respectability. The burqa became a symbol of the conservative and totalitarian Taliban rule, who strictly enforced female adults to wear the dress. Although the Taliban regime ended in 2001, some women continue to wear it out of security concerns or as a cultural practice. Opposers to the burqa claim it is not Islamic, nor part of Afghan culture. Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser laughing at the Muslim Brotherhood for suggesting in 1953 that women should be required to wear the hijab NiqƒÅb in Egypt. In 1953, Egyptian leader President Gamal Abdel Nasser was told by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood that they wanted to enforce the wearing of the hijab, to which Nasser responded: \\"Sir, I know you have a daughter in college ‚Äì and she doesn't wear a headscarf or anything! Why don't you make her wear the headscarf? So you can't make one girl, your own daughter, wear it, and yet you want me to go and make ten million women wear it?\\". The veil gradually disappeared in the following decades, so much so that by 1958 an article by the United Press (UP) stated that \\"the veil is unknown here.\\" However, the veil has been having a resurgence since the Iranian Revolution, concomitant with the global revival of Muslim piety. According to The New York Times, as of 2007 about 90 percent of Egyptian women currently wear a headscarf. Small numbers of women wear the niqab. The secular government does not encourage women to wear it, fearing it will present an Islamic extremist political opposition. In the country, it is negatively associated with Salafist political activism. There has been some restrictions on wearing the hijab by the government, which views hijab as a political symbol. In 2002, two presenters were excluded from a state run TV station for deciding to wear hijab on national television.Ranyah Sabry (17 April 2007) Egypt anchorwomen battle for hijab BBC News (BBC). Retrieved on 13 February 2009. The American University in Cairo, Cairo University and Helwan University attempted to forbid entry to niqab wearers in 2004 and 2007. Egyptian storekeeper in Cairo wearing a hijab Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, Grand Imam of al-Azhar, issued a fatwa in October 2009 arguing that veiling of the face is not required under Islam. He had reportedly asked a student to take off her niqab when he spotted her in a classroom, and he told her that the niqab is a cultural tradition without Islamic importance. It is widely believed that the hijab is becoming more of a fashion statement than a religious one in Egypt, with many Egyptian women, influenced by social peer pressure, wearing colorful, stylish head scarves along with western style clothing. Government bans on wearing the niqab on college campuses at the University of Cairo and during university exams in 2009 were overturned later. Minister Hany Mahfouz Helal met protests by some human rights and Islamist groups.

Indonesia The traditional dress of Indonesian Minang women includes elaborate head-covering Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta In Indonesia, the term jilbab is used without exception to refer to the hijab.John M. Echols, Hassan Shadily, An English-Indonesian dictionary: Kamus Inggris-Indonesia Kamus Inggris-Indonesia University Press: 1975, , 660 pages Under Indonesian national and regional law, female head-covering is entirely optional and not obligatory. In 2008, Indonesia had the single largest global population of Muslims. However, the Indonesian Constitution of Pancasila provides equal government protection for six state-sanctioned religions (namely Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism), without any one supreme or official state religion. Some women may choose to wear a headscarf to be more \\"formal\\" or \\"religious\\", such as the jilbab or kerudung (a native tailored veil with a small, stiff visor). Such formal or cultural Muslim events may include official governmental events, funerals, circumcision (sunatan) ceremonies or weddings. However, wearing Islamic attire to Christian relatives' funerals and weddings and entering the church is quite uncommon. Culturally to the Javanese majority, plain, Saudi-style hijab, the niqab or socially worse yet the indigenous peasant kerudung (known in North Sumatran languages as tudung) is considered vulgar, low-class and a faux pas ‚Äì the traditional Javanese hijab are transparent, sheer, intricately brocaded or embroidered fine silk or lace tailored to match either their sarung or kebaya blouse. Young girls may also elect to wear the hijab publicly to avoid unwanted low-class male attention and molestation and thus display their respectability as \\"good Muslim girls\\": that is, they are not \\"easy\\" conquests.S. A. Niessen, Ann Marie Leshkowich, Carla Jones, Re-orienting fashion: the globalization of Asian dress: Berg Publishers: 2003: , , 283 pages pp 206‚Äì207 Additionally, Islamic private school uniform code dictate that female students must wear the jilbab (commonly white or blue-grey, Indonesia's national secondary school colours), in addition to long-sleeved blouse and ankle-length skirt. Islamic schools must by law provide access to Christians (and vice versa Catholic and Protestant schools allow Muslim students) and it is to be worn by Christian students who attend Muslim school, and its use by Muslim students is not objected to in Christian schools. Many nuns refer to their habit as a jilbab, perhaps out of the colloquial use of the term to refer to any religious head covering. The sole exception where jilbab is mandatory is in Aceh Province, under Islamic Sharia-based Law No 18/2001, granting Aceh special autonomy and through its own Regional Legislative body Regulation Nr. 5/2001, as enacted per Acehnese plebiscite (in favour). This Acehnese Hukum Syariah and the reputedly over-bearing \\"Morality Police\\" who enforce its (Aceh-only) mandatory public wearing are the subject of fierce debate, especially with regard to its validity vis-a-vis the Constitution among Acehnese male and female Muslim academics, Acehnese male and female politicians and female rights advocates. Female police officers are not allowed to wear hijab, except in Aceh. But since 25 March 2015, based on Surat Keputusan Kapolri Nomor:Kep/245/II/2015 female police officers can now wear hijab if they want. Flight attendants are not allowed to wear hijab except during flights to the Middle East. Compounding the friction and often anger toward baju Arab (Arab clothes), is the ongoing physical and emotional abuse of Indonesian women in Saudi Arabia, as guest workers, commonly maids or as Hajja pilgrims and Saudi Wahhabi intolerance for non-Saudi dress code has given rise to mass protests and fierce Indonesian debate up to the highest levels of government about boycotting Saudi Arabia ‚Äì especially the profitable all Hajj pilgrimage ‚Äì as many high-status women have been physically assaulted by Saudi morality police for non-conforming head-wear or even applying lip- balm ‚Äì leading some to comment on the post-pan Arabist repressiveness of certain Arab nations due to excessively rigid, narrow and erroneous interpretation of Sharia law.

Official measures were relaxed under Reza Shah's successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the wearing of a headscarf or chador was no longer an offence, but was still considered an indicator of backwardness or of membership of the lower class. Discrimination against women wearing the headscarf or chador was still widespread with public institutions actively discouraging their use, and some eating establishments refusing to admit women who wore them.Ramezani, Reza (2008).

In 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini announced that women should observe Islamic dress code, his statement sparked demonstrations which were met by government assurances that the statement was only a recommendation.Algar, Hamid (2001). Roots of the Islamic Revolution in Iran: Four Lectures, Oneonta, New York: Islamic Publications International (IPI), p. 84, Hijab was subsequently made mandatory in government and public offices in 1980, and in 1983 it became mandatory for all women (including non-Muslims and non-citizens). = White Wednesday = In May 2017, My Stealthy Freedom, an Iranian online movement advocating for women's freedom of choice, created the White Wednesday movement: a campaign that invites men and women to wear white veils, scarves or bracelets to show their opposition to the mandatory forced veiling code. The movement was geared towards women who proudly wear their veils, but reject the idea that all women in Iran should be subject to forced veiling. Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-born journalist and activist based in the United Kingdom and the United States, created the movement to protest Iran's mandatory hijab rule. She described her 2017 movement via Facebook, saying, \\"This campaign is addressed to women who willingly wear the veil, but who remain opposed to the idea of imposing it on others. Many veiled women in Iran also find the compulsory imposition of the veil to be an insult. By taking videos of themselves wearing white, these women can also show their disagreement with compulsion.\\" The campaign resulted in Iranian women posting pictures and videos of themselves wearing pieces of white clothing to social media. = The Girls of Enghelab Street = On 27 December 2017, 31-year-old Vida Movahed, also known as \\"The Girl of Enghelab Street\\" was arrested for being unveiled in public after a video of the woman went viral on social media. The video showed Movahed silently waving her hijab, a white headscarf that she had removed from her head and placed on a stick for one hour on Enqelab Street, Tehran. At first it was assumed that her act was connected to the widespread protests taking place in Iran, but Movahed confirmed that she performed the act in support of the 2017 White Wednesday campaign. Vida's arrest sparked outrage from social media, where many Iranians shared footage of her protest along with the hashtag \\"#Where_Is_She?\\". On 28 January 2018, Nasrin Sotoudeh, a renowned human rights lawyer, posted on Facebook that Vida had been released. It was not until a few weeks later that Sotoudeh revealed the girl's identity. In the following weeks, multiple people re-enacted Vida MovahedVida's public display of removing their hijabs and waving them in the air. On 1 February 2018, the Iranian police released a statement saying that they had arrested 29 people, mostly women, for removing their headscarves, contrary to Iranian law. One woman, Shima Babaei, was arrested after removing her headdress in front of a court as a symbol of her continued dedication to the cause. On 23 February 2018, Iranian Police released an official statement saying that any women found protesting Iran's compulsory veiling code would be charged with \\"inciting corruption and prostitution,\\" which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Before this change, according to article 638 of the Islamic Penal Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran, \\"Anyone in public places and roads who openly commits a harƒÅm (sinful) act, in addition to the punishment provided for the act, shall be sentenced to two months imprisonment or up to 74 lashes; and if they commit an act that is not punishable but violates public prudency, they shall only be sentenced to ten days to two months' imprisonment or up to 74 lashes. Note- Women who appear in public places and roads without wearing an Islamic hijab, shall be sentenced to ten days to two months' imprisonment or a fine of fifty thousand to five hundred rials.\\" Following the announcement, multiple women reported being subjected to physical abuse by police following their arrests. Some have since been sentenced to multiple years in prison for their acts of defiance. In one video, a woman stands on top of a tall box, unveiled, waving her white scarf at passers by. The video then shows a man in a police uniform tackling the woman to the ground. Shortly after the video went viral, the Ministry of Interior (Iran) scolded police for using physical force against the woman. Salman Samani, a spokesman for Ministry released a statement on 25 February 2018 saying \\"No one has a license to act against the law even in the role of an officer dealing with crimes.\\" On 8 March 2018, a video of three Iranian women singing a feminist fight song in Tehran's subway went viral on. The women were singing in honor of International Women's Day and to highlight women's continued challenges caused by forced veiling and other discriminatory laws against women. In the video, in which three bare-headed Iranian women sing I am a Woman, calls upon women to join efforts to fight injustice and create \\"another world\\" of \\"equality\\". The women hold hands, display pictures of a previous women's rights protest, and ask the other women on the subway train to clap in honor of \\"having lived and fought all their lives against all kinds of discrimination, violence, humiliation, and insults.\\" At the end of the video, one of the protestors is heard saying \\"Happy Women's Day to all of you.\\" That same day, the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, made a speech during a gathering of religious poets in Tehran, posting a series of tweets in response to the series of peaceful hijab protests. Khamenei defended the dress code, praising Islam for keeping women \\"modest\\" and in their \\"defined roles\\" such as educators and mothers. He also lashed out at the Western World for, in his view, leading its own women astray. \\"The features of today‚Äôs Iranian woman include modesty, chastity, eminence, protecting herself from abuse by men,\\" Khamenei tweeted. He claimed that the most sought after characteristic of a Western woman involve is her ability to physically attract men. Iraq Iraqi women wearing hijab in Baghdad In south Iraq, particularly in the Shi'a holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, custom requires women to wear hijab. Women in public places usually wear abaya which is a long black cloth that covers the whole body except the face and the hands, in addition to the scarf that only covers the hair. They might wear boushiya. In private, in governmental institutions and universities they can wear manteaux which could be long or short with a scarf covering the head.In Arab Sunni majority provinceses of East Iraq hijab/heads is also mandatory. In Baghdad and Iraqi Kurdistan, women are free to choose whether or not to wear the hijab. In 2017, the Iraqi army imposed a burqa ban in the liberated areas of Mosul for the month of Ramadan. Police stated that the temporary ban was for security measures, so that ISIS bombers could not disguise themselves as women. Jordan There are no laws requiring the wearing of headscarves nor any banning such from any public institution. The use of the headscarf increased during the 1980s. However, the use of the headscarf is generally prevalent among the lower and lower middle classes. Veils covering the face as well as the chador are rare. It is widely believed that the hijab is increasingly becoming more of a fashion statement in Jordan than a religious one with Jordanian women wearing colorful, stylish headscarves along with western-style clothing. Lebanon Hijab is not regulated by law in Lebanon. Malaysia Young Malaysian woman wearing a hijab The headscarf is known as a tudung, which simply means \\"cover\\". (The word is used with that meaning in other contexts, e.g. tudung saji, a dish cover for food.) Muslim women may freely choose whether or not to wear the headscarf. The exception is when visiting a mosque, where the tudung must be worn; this requirement also includes non-Muslims. Although headscarves are permitted in government institutions, public servants are prohibited from wearing the full-facial veil or niqab. A judgment from the then‚ÄìSupreme Court of Malaysia in 1994 cites that the niqab, or purdah, \\"has nothing to do with (a woman's) constitutional right to profess and practise her Muslim religion\\", because Islam does not make it obligatory to cover the face.Hjh Halimatussaadiah bte Hj Kamaruddin v Public Services Commission, Malaysia & Anor [1994] 3 MLJ 61. Although wearing the hijab, or tudung, is not mandatory for women in Malaysia, some government buildings enforce within their premises a dress code which bans women, Muslim and non-Muslim, from entering while wearing \\"revealing clothes\\". As of 2013 the vast majority of Muslim Malaysian (mostly ethnic Malay) women wear the tudung, a type of hijab.

Maldives There are no official laws in the Constitution of the Maldives that require women to cover their heads, but Maldivian women commonly wear a hijab and niqab in public. There are reports of women being pressured into covering themselves by close relatives; conversely, the American U.S. State Department's annual International Religious Freedom Report in 2007 referenced one instance in which a female student was restricted from attending school for wearing a headscarf, despite civil servants wearing them at work without issue. Morocco A group of Moroccan women wearing headscarves and veils In Morocco, the headscarf is not forbidden by law, and women are free to choose to wear one. The headscarf is more frequent in the northern regions, small to medium cities and rural regions. As it is not totally widespread, wearing a hijab is considered rather a religious decision. In 2005, a schoolbook for basic religious education was heavily criticized for picturing female children with headscarves, and later the picture of the little girl with the Islamic headscarf was removed from the school books. The headscarf is strongly and implicitly forbidden in Morocco's military and the police. In January 2017 Morocco banned the manufacturing, marketing and sale of the burqa. Pakistan Benazir Bhutto, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, wore a duppatta scarf. Pakistan has no laws banning or enforcing the ƒßijƒÅb. In Pakistan, most women wear shalwar kameez, a tunic top and baggy or skintight trouser set which covers their legs and body. Depending on the societal status and city, a loose dupatta scarf is worn around the shoulders and upper chest or just on the shoulder, or isn't used at all. Women are not expected to wear a hijab or scarf in public, but many women in Pakistan wear different forms of the ƒßijƒÅb and it varies for rural and different urban areas. For example, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas a minority of the women wear the full head-to-toe black burqa/chador while in the rest of the provinces, including Azad Kashmir, most of the women wear the dupatta (a long scarf that matches the woman's garments). In Karachi, middle- class women wore black 2-piece burqas, sometimes with a 3rd piece of a sheer face veil, in the 1950s in public. Starting in the 1960s, the 3 piece suit of shalvar, kameez, and dupatta over the shoulders, and uncovered head and hair, gradually became more popular. Many women who immigrated to Pakistan from India wore midriff bearing saris. In the late '90s the trend began to reverse, when more women began wearing the black burqa, or otherwise covering their head with a dupatta or scarf. There are two primary reasons for the reversal: many Pakistanis have lived in Persian Gulf countries and became accustomed to hijab and black abayas; there has been more gun violence in Pakistani society since the 1980s due to the trafficking of arms to Afghanistan, and some women feel safer being covered up. Today only the most fashionable women wear saris. Neighboring Iran, where women wear pants with an overcoat and scarf, is closer to what Pakistani women wear and there is some cross-influence. Westerners are also expected to dress modestly. Pakistani society observes traditional dress customs and it is advisable for women to wear long trousers which cover all of the legs, and tops with sleeves which don't show cleavage. Baring a midriff in a sari is more accepted than baring legs of any length. In the big cities, some teenage girls wear jeans underneath tunics, especially in casual settings, shopping malls and around picnic spots. Dress codes for men are more lax, though shorts, t-shirts, vest tops, and speedos are uncommon. For women, swimsuits and midi-and mini-skirts are considered immodest and are thus a social taboo. Saudi Arabia Saudi woman wearing a Niqab. While most versions of Islamic law suggests that women should dress modestly, Saudi Arabian dress code used to legally require women, local and foreign, to wear an abaya, a garment that covers the body and arms in public. According to most Salafi scholars, a woman is to cover her entire body, including her face and hands, in front of unrelated men. Hence, the vast majority of traditional Saudi women are expected to cover their body and hair in public.Marfuqi, Kitab ul Mar'ah fil Ahkam, pg 133 The Saudi niqƒÅb usually leaves a long open slot for the eyes; the slot is held together by a string or narrow strip of cloth.Moqtasami (1979), pp. 41‚Äì44 The Saudi burqa is a typically black garment that completely covers a woman head to toe, including a veil that covers her face, with a mesh window across the eyes to see out of. It is widely believed that the abaya is increasingly becoming more of a fashion statement in Saudi Arabia than a religious one with Saudi women wearing colorful, stylish Abayas along with western-style clothing. Women in Saudi Arabia need not wear headcover or the black abaya ‚Äì the loose-fitting, full-length robes symbolic of Islamic piety ‚Äì as long as their attire is \\"decent and respectful\\", the kingdom's reform-minded crown prince said. Somalia Somali women wearing the hijab.233x233px During regular, day-to-day activities, Somali women usually wear the guntiino, a long stretch of cloth tied over the shoulder and draped around the waist. In more formal settings such as weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the dirac, which is a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or polyester that is worn over a full- length half-slip and a brassiere. Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as shash, and also often cover their upper body with a shawl known as garbasaar. Unmarried or young women, however, They wear hijab, and the jiilbab is also commonly worn.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.117-118. Sudan While the hijab is not explicitly mandated by law, Sudanese women are required to dress modestly in public. Due to Sudan's vaguely worded Public Order law, there are no delineated parameters of what constitutes immodest dress. The law states: \\"Whoever does in a public place an indecent act or an act contrary to public morals or wears an obscene outfit or contrary to public morals or causing an annoyance to public feelings shall be punished with flogging which may not exceed forty lashes or with fine or with both\\". In 2013, the case of Amira Osman Hamid came to international attention when she chose to expose her hair in public, in opposition to the nation's public-order laws. Syria In 2010, Ghiyath Barakat, Syria's minister of higher education, announced a ban on women wearing full-face veils at universities. The official stated that the face veils ran counter to secular and academic principles of Syria. However, the ban strictly addresses veils that cover the head and mouth, and does not include hijabs, or headscarfs, which most Syrian women wear.  Tajikistan  Tajik woman wearing a Hijab In 2017, the government of Tajikistan passed a law requiring people to \\"stick to traditional national clothes and culture\\", which has been widely seen as an attempt to prevent women from wearing Islamic clothing, in particular the style of headscarf wrapped under the chin, in contrast to the traditional Tajik headscarf tied behind the head. Tunisia Tunisian authorities say they are encouraging women, instead, to \\"wear modest dress in line with Tunisian traditions\\", i.e. no headscarf. In 1981, women with headscarves were banned from schools and government buildings, and since then those who insist on wearing them face losing their jobs.Abdelhadi, Magdi Tunisia attacked over headscarves, BBC News, 26 September 2006. Accessed 6 June 2008. Recently in 2006, the authorities launched a campaign against the hijab, banning it in some public places, where police would stop women on the streets and ask them to remove it, and warn them not to wear it again. The government described the headscarf as a sectarian form of dress which came uninvited to the country. As of 14 January 2011, after the Tunisian revolution took place,Tunisian revolution the headscarf was authorized and the ban lifted. However, in contemporary urban Tunisian society, remnants of decades worth of discouragement remain. On 6 July 2019 the government banned the wearing of the niqab in public institutions citing security reasons. Turkey Turkish women with hijab Turkey is officially a secular state, and the hijab was banned in universities and public buildings until late 2013 ‚Äì this included libraries or government buildings. The ban was first in place during the 1980 military coup, but the law was strengthened in 1997. There has been some unofficial relaxation of the ban under governments led by the conservative party AKP in recent years, for example the current government of the AKP is willing to lift the ban in universities, however the new law was upheld by the constitutional court. Some researchers claim that about 55‚Äì60% of Turkish women cover their heads. A number of women wear a headscarf for cultural reasons. That cultural headscarf is used by women that work under the sun to protect their heads from sunburn. In cities like Istanbul and Ankara about a half of women cover their heads. In the cities in eastern Turkey, more women cover their heads . On 7 February 2008, the Turkish Parliament passed an amendment to the constitution, allowing women to wear the headscarf in Turkish universities, arguing that many women would not seek an education if they could not wear the hijab.Derakhshandeh, Mehran. Just a headscarf? Tehran Times. Mehr News Agency. 16 February 2008.Jenkins, Gareth. Turkey's Constitutional Changes: Much Ado About Nothing? Eurasia Daily Monitor. The Jamestown Foundation. 11 February 2008.Ayman, Zehra; Knickmeyer, Ellen. Ban on Head Scarves Voted Out in Turkey: Parliament Lifts 80-Year-Old Restriction on University Attire. The Washington Post. 10 February 2008. Page A17. The decision was met with powerful opposition and protests from secularists. On 5 June 2008, the Constitutional Court of Turkey reinstated the ban on constitutional grounds of the secularity of the state. Headscarves had become a focal point of the conflict between the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the secularist establishment. The ruling was widely seen as a victory for Turks who claim this maintains Turkey's separation of state and religion. In 2013, the headscarf ban in public institutions was lifted through a decree, even though the ban officially stands through court decisions.Euronews (08.10.2013) The headscarf ban in public institutions in Turkey was officially lifted The ban on wearing hijab in high schools was lifted in 2014.  Yemen  Yemeni women wearing niqab Although there is no dress code that legally forces veiling upon women in Yemen, the abaya and niqab are social norms in Yemen and are worn by girls from a young age. In some areas, the hijab is part of school uniforms. Yemeni women who choose to not wear headscarves are at risk of oppression. When Nobel Peace Laureate Tawakkol Karman was asked by journalists about her hijab with regard to her intellect and education, she replied, \\"man in early times was almost naked, and as his intellect evolved he started wearing clothes. What I am today and what I‚Äôm wearing represents the highest level of thought and civilization that man has achieved, and is not regressive. It‚Äôs the removal of clothes again that is regressive back to ancient times.\\" Israel Mannequins with traditional Muslim veil and hoods at Tira's (Israel) Saturday's market In July 2010, some Israeli lawmakers and women's rights activists proposed a bill to the Knesset banning face-covering veils. According to the Jerusalem Post, the measure is generally \\"regarded as highly unlikely to become law.\\" Hanna Kehat, founder of the Jewish women's rights group Kolech, criticized a ban and also commented \\"[f]ashion also often oppresses women with norms which lead to anorexia.\\" Eilat Maoz, general coordinator for the Coalition of Women for Peace, referred to a ban as \\"a joke\\" that would constitute \\"racism\\". In Israel, orthodox Jews dress modestly by keeping most of their skin covered. Married women cover their hair, most commonly in the form of a scarf, also in the form of hats, snoods, berets, or, sometimes, wigs. =Gaza Strip= Arab woman and man chatting in 1890: the woman is wearing a hijab. Successful informal coercion of women by sectors of society to wear Islamic dress or hijab has been reported in the Gaza Strip where Mujama' al-Islami, the predecessor of Hamas, reportedly used a mixture of consent and coercion to \\"'restore' hijab\\" on urban-educated women in Gaza in the late 1970s and 1980s.\\"Women and the Hijab in the Intifada\\", Rema Hammami Middle East Report, May‚ÄìAugust 1990 Similar behavior was displayed by Hamas during the First Intifada.Rubenberg, C., Palestinian Women: Patriarchy and Resistance in the West Bank (USA, 2001) p.230 Hamas campaigned for the wearing of the hijab alongside other measures, including insisting that women stay at home, they should be segregated from men, and for the promotion of polygamy. During the course of this campaign women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed, with the result that the hijab was being worn \\"just to avoid problems on the streets\\".Rubenberg, C., Palestinian Women: Patriarchy and Resistance in the West Bank (USA, 2001) p.231 Following the takeover of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Hamas has attempted to implement Islamic law in the Gaza Strip, mainly at schools, institutions and courts by imposing the Islamic dress or hijab on women.xinhuanet.com, 3 January 2010 Some of the Islamization efforts met resistance. When Palestinian Supreme Court Justice Abdel Raouf Al-Halabi ordered women lawyers to wear headscarves and caftans in court, attorneys contacted satellite television stations including Al-Arabiya to protest, causing Hamas's Justice Ministry to cancel the directive.Hamas Bans Women Dancers, Scooter Riders in Gaza Push By Daniel Williams, Bloomberg, 30 November 2009 In 2007, the Islamic group Swords of Truth threatened to behead female TV broadcasters if they didn't wear the hijab. \\"We will cut throats, and from vein to vein, if needed to protect the spirit and moral of this nation,\\" their statement said. The group also accused the women broadcasters of being \\"without any ... shame or morals\\". Personal threats against female broadcasters were also sent to the women's mobile phones, though it was not clear if these threats were from the same group. Gazan anchorwomen interviewed by Associated Press said that they were frightened by the Swords of Truth statement. In February 2011, Hamas banned the styling of women's hair, continuing its policy of enforcing Sharia upon women's clothing. Hamas has imposed analogous restrictions on men as well as women. For example, men are no longer allowed to be shirtless in public. Northern Cyprus Muslim Turkish-Cypriot women wore traditional Islamic headscarves.Cypriot Attire Project, Cyprus History in Brief When leaving their homes, Muslim Cypriot women would cover their faces by pulling a corner of the headscarf across their nose and mouth, a custom recorded as early as 1769. In accordance with the islands' strict moral code, Turkish Cypriot women also wore long skirts or pantaloons in order to cover the soles of their feet. Most men covered their heads with either a headscarf (similar to a wrapped keffiyeh, \\"a form of turban\\"Eicher, Joanne Bubolz, Dress and Ethnicity: Change Across Space and Time, p.35, 1995) or a fez. Turbans have been worn by Cypriot men since ancient times and were recorded by Herodotus, during the Persian rule of the island, to demonstrate their \\"oriental\\" customs compared to Greeks.Irwin, Elizabeth K., Reading Herodotus: A Study of the Logoi in Book 5 of Herodotus' Histories, p. 273, 2007 Following the globalisation of the island, however, many younger Sunni Muslim Turkish-Cypriots abandoned wearing traditional dress, such as headscarves. Yet they are still worn by older Muslim Cypriot women.

Some Islamic adherents (like Uzbeks) used to wear the paranja, while others (Chechens, Kara-Chai, Tajiks, Kazakhs, Turkmens, etc.) wore traditional scarves the same way as a bandanna and have own traditional styles of headgear which are not called by the word hijab. Africa Women in Algeria wearing a ha√Øk, a type of veil Cameroon On 12 July 2015, two women dressed in religious garments blew themselves up in Fotokol, killing 13 people. Following the attacks, since 16 July, Cameroon banned the wearing of full-face veils, including the burqa, in the Far North region. Governor Midjiyawa Bakari of the mainly Muslim region said the measure was to prevent further attacks.Cameroon bans Islamic face veil after suicide bombings, 16 July 2015. Retrieved 18 July 2015.  Chad  Following a double suicide bombing on 15 June 2015 which killed 33 people in N'Djamena, the Chadian government announced on 17 June 2015 the banning of the wearing of the burqa in its territory for security reasons.

Congo-Brazzaville The full- face veil was banned in May 2015 in public places in Congo-Brazzaville to \\"counter terrorism\\", although there has not been an Islamist attack in the country. Gabon On 15 July 2015, Gabon announced a ban on the wearing of full-face veils in public and places of work. The mainly Christian country said it was prompted to do so because of the attacks in Cameroon. Asia- Pacific Australia In September 2011, Australia's most populous state, New South Wales, passed the Identification Legislation Amendment Act 2011 to require a person to remove a face covering if asked by a state official. The law is viewed as a response to a court case of 2011 where a woman in Sydney was convicted of falsely claiming that a traffic policeman had tried to remove her niqab. The debate in Australia is more about when and where face coverings may legitimately be restricted.The Full Face Covering Debate: An Australian Perspective by Renae BARKER In a Western Australian case in July 2010, a woman sought to give evidence in court wearing a niqab. The request was refused on the basis that the jury needs to see the face of the person giving evidence. China Uyghur woman with headscarf in Xinjiang, China In 2017, China banned the burqa in the Islamic area of Xinjiang. Myanmar At a conference in Yangon held by the Organization for the Protection of Race and Religion on 21 June 2015, a group of monks locally called Ma Ba Tha declared that the headscarves \\"were not in line with school discipline\\", recommending the Burmese government to ban the wearing of hijabs by Muslim schoolgirls and to ban the butchering of animals on the Eid holiday.Hijab Ban 2015: Buddhist Monks Propose Anti-Muslim Measure On Burmese Schoolgirls, 22 June 2015 Sri Lanka A Sri Lankan MP called for both burqa and niqab to be banned from the country in wake of the Easter terror attack which happened on 21 April 2019 during a local parliamentary session.

India Muslim girls in Kargil In April 2019, Shiv Sena party member Sanjay Raut called for the burka to be banned. In February 2020, Uttar Pradesh‚Äôs labor minister Raghuraj Singh has called for an outright ban on women wearing burqas, suggesting that terrorists have been using them to elude authorities. North America Canada On 12 December 2011, the Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration issued a decree banning the niqab or any other face-covering garments for women swearing their oath of citizenship; the hijab was not affected.Face veils banned for citizenship oaths. CBC. Published 12 December 2011. Retrieved 21 December 2011. This edict was later overturned by a Court of Appeal on the grounds of being unlawful. Mohamed Elmasry, a controversial former president of the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC), has stated that only a small minority of Muslim Canadian women actually wear these types of clothing. He has also said that women should be free to choose, as a matter of culture and not religion, whether they wear it. The CIC criticized a proposed law that would have required all voters to show their faces before being allowed to cast ballots. The group described the idea as unnecessary, arguing that it would only promote discrimination against Muslims and provide \\"political mileage among Islamophobes\\". In February 2007, soccer player Asmahan Mansour, part of the team Nepean U12 Hotspurs, was expelled from a Quebec tournament for wearing her headscarf. Quebec soccer referees also ejected an 11-year-old Ottawa girl while she was watching a match, which generated a public controversy. In November 2013, a bill commonly referred to as the Quebec Charter of Values was introduced in the National Assembly of Quebec by the Parti Qu√©b√©cois that would ban overt religious symbols in the Quebec public service. Thus would include universities, hospitals, and public or publicly funded schools and daycares. Criticism of this decision came from The Globe and Mail newspaper, saying that such clothing, as worn by \\"2011 Nobel Peace Prize winner Tawakkul Karman\\", was \\"Good enough for Nobel, but not for Quebec\\".Good enough for Nobel, but not for Quebec, The Globe and Mail In 2014 however, the ruling Parti Qu√©b√©cois was defeated by the Liberal Party of Quebec and no legislation was enacted regarding religious symbols. In October 2017 a Quebec ban on face covering made headlines. , the ban has been suspended by at least two judges for violating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was first suspended in December 2017. With regards to public opinion, a 27 October 2017 Ipsos poll found that 76% of Quebecers backed Bill 62, with 24% opposing it. The same survey found the 68% of Canadians in general supported a law similar to Bill 62 in their part of Canada. A 27 October Angus Reid Institute poll found that 70% Canadians outside of Quebec supported \\"legislation similar to Bill 62\\" where they lived in the country, with 30% opposing it. As of June 2019, wearing religious symbols is prohibited for certain public servants in positions of authority in Qu√©bec: police, judges and teachers. People such as Tarek Fatah and Ensaf Haidar have called on the burka to be banned. Mexico There is no ban on any Muslim clothing items. The first article of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States protects people against discrimination based on several matters including religion, ethnic origin and national origin. Article 6 of the Constitution grants Libertad de Expresi√≥n (freedom of expression) to all Mexicans which includes the way people choose to dress. The Muslim community is a minority; according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life there were about 3,700 Muslims in Mexico as of 2010, representing 0.003 percent of the total population. There is an almost complete lack of knowledge of Islam in Mexico, and any interest is more out of curiosity and tolerance than hatred or racism. Some Muslims suggest that it is easier to fit in if they are lax with the rules of their religion, for example by wearing regular clothing. Muslim women's clothing can vary from non-Muslim clothing to a hijab or a chador. United States The people of the United States have a firm First Amendment protection of freedom of speech from government interference that explicitly includes clothing items, as described by Supreme Court cases such as Tinker v. Des Moines. As such, a ban on Islamic clothing is considered presumptively invalid by U.S. socio-political commentators such as Mona Charen of National Review. Journalist Howard LaFranchi of The Christian Science Monitor has referred to \\"the traditional American respect for different cultural communities and religions under the broad umbrella of universal freedoms\\" as forbidding the banning of Islamic dress. In his prominent June 2009 speech to the Muslim World in Cairo, President Barack Obama called on the West \\"to avoid dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear\\" and elaborated that such rules involve \\"hostility\\" towards Muslims in \\"the pretense of liberalism\\". Most gyms, fitness clubs, and other workout facilities in the United States are mixed-sex, so exercise without a hijab or burqa can be difficult for some observant Muslim women. Maria Omar, director of media relations for the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA), has advised Muslim women to avoid these complexes entirely. Some women decide to wear something colloquially known as the \\"sports hijab\\". Similarly, Muslim women may feel uncomfortable around other women with traditionally revealing American outfits, especially during the summer \\"bikini season\\". An outfit colloquially known as the burqini allows Muslim women to swim without displaying any significant amount of skin. Compared to Western Europe, the Muslim garb is less commonly seen in major US cities and there have been relatively few controversies surrounding the hijab in everyday life. One exception is the case of Sultaana Freeman, a Florida woman who had her driver's license cancelled due to her wearing of the niqab in her identification photo. She sued the state of Florida for religious discrimination, though her case was eventually thrown out. In January 2017, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division in Camden County dismissed two suits filed by Linda Tisby in summer 2015 against her former employer, the county's Department of Corrections. The court decided that a New Jersey Superior Court was right to rule that it would have been an \\"undue hardship\\" for the agency to accommodate her religious beliefs \\"because of overriding safety concerns, the potential for concealment of contraband, and the importance of uniform neutrality\\".

It is described in the public Register of all Arms and Bearing in Scotland as follows: > Per pale Or and Azure: a fess chequy per pale, dexter of the Second and > Argent, sinister of the Third and Gules, surmounted of a shakefork, Sable > overall, all between a bonnet of the second, with a round tassel of the > Fourth, and an annulet of the First, stoned of the Fourth, in chief, and > another similar bonnet and a mullet of the Third in base.

Origin of the Arms  The roots of Stewarton go back to 1283, when the lands of Stewarton were put into separate Lordship and became the inheritance of James, High Stewart of Scotland. When the House of Stewart came to the throne of Scotland, Stewarton became property of The Crown. The makeup of the Arms has a long history, part of which is reputed to be due to an act which saved the life of Malcolm Canmore who became King Malcolm III in 1058. While on the run from MacBeth's men he was saved by a Stewarton farmer, named Cunninghame, who hid him under forked hay. Upon becoming King, he gave the farmer the Corsehill Estate. The town of Stewarton developed around a church. After the Reformation the land belonging to the church passed into \\"Lay hands\\", and Stewarton was administered by commissioners and magistrates, whose offices were not filled by free election, and their tenure has no fixed date. The Act of 1868 ended this autocratic rule and laid the foundations of democratic government. The town became a Police burgh in 1868 and, like many other Scottish towns, had its coat of arms ‚Äì a Stewarton Bonnet over a Shake Fork and inscribed motto \\"Over Fork Over\\". However, this coat of arms was not officially registered and it was not until 1955 that the Burgh obtained one. The legend of Malcolm Canmore and the Stewarton farmer was not accepted by Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, Lord Lyon King of Arms, and since he had the power of execution the Town Council had to accept his design. The Motto was changed to Knit Weel, a compliment to the towns ancient industry. The design includes part of the baronial arms of the Earls of Douglas, Earls of Arran, the Cunninghames of Corsehill, and the Montgomeries of Lainshaw. These prominent families had early association with the Burgh, and their arms share a place with the bonnets, which represent the Town and Trade. From 1955 to 1975 the people of Stewarton were familiar with the Coat of Arms. The Local Government reorganisation, enforced in 1975, meant the existing Burghs and their Councils were abolished and the rights to use the Coat of Arms was lost. Stewarton and District Community Council petitioned the Lord Lyon for the return of the Stewarton Coat of Arms. The re-granting of the Arms Ceremony, by the Lord Lyon King of Arms representative, took place prior to the Bonnet Guild's Crowning Ceremony for the Corsehill Queen on Saturday 15 June 2002.

In addition, AJWS believes women are critical drivers of community development and change, and that marginalized communities that are vulnerable to poverty and human rights violations are powerful agents of change and development when mobilized from within. Advocacy AJWS works to promote awareness and influence U.S. international policies and funding in relation to human rights, global health and poverty, by rallying members of the community to advocate for policies that will improve the lives of millions of people in the developing world. AJWS's current advocacy priorities include retaining the centrality of human rights within U.S. foreign policy through funding, diplomacy and policy. This includes supporting the HER Act, which would legislatively repeal the Mexico City Policy, the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act, which would sanction human rights violators in Burma, and working to stop, delay and mitigate new policies that undermine human rights abroad. Internationally, AJWS works to increase the quality and quantity of funds supporting grassroots groups so that said funds are flexible, longstanding and feminist in their approaches.  History  AJWS was established in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 1, 1985, when Larry Phillips and Larry Simon, together with a group of rabbis, Jewish communal leaders, activists, business people, scholars and others, came together to create the first American Jewish organization dedicated to alleviating poverty, hunger, and disease among people across the globe. In her book, If I Am Not for Myself: The Liberal Betrayal of the Jews, Ruth Wisse argues that AJWS is one of a group of left- of-center Jewish organizations and publications founded in the 1980s without explaining why a new, Jewish was needed to support address causes already being addressed by well-established, American charities to which many Jewish were already contributors. Wisse argues that the actual motivation was a need felt by highly educated Jews to counter rising antisemitism on the left by performative acts of \\"public avowals of kindliness and liberalism.\\" The organization's first key achievement was its response to a volcano disaster in Armaro, Colombia, in 1986. In 1990, after moving headquarters to New York City, AJWS launched five new international development projects in Mexico, Honduras, and Haiti, which provided training programs in sustainable agriculture. In 1991, then AJWS President Andrew Griffel was elected to the Executive Committee of InterAction, a consortium of over a hundred international humanitarian organizations. Shortly after the September 11th attacks, AJWS responded by receiving donations and making grants to groups that provide support to families of low-income workers. In 2004, AJWS responded to the Indian Ocean tsunami, and co-founded the Save Darfur Coalition. In 2006, AJWS helped organize a rally in Washington, D.C., against genocide, and has since conducted a series of other rallies throughout the country. In 2010, AJWS responded to the earthquake in Haiti, raising nearly $6 million for Haitian-led recovery efforts, and in 2011 launched Reverse Hunger: Ending the Global Food Crisis, a campaign to reform U.S. food aid policy. In 2013, AJWS launched the ‚ÄúWe Believe‚Äù campaign, a national advocacy campaign that called on the U.S. government to promote human rights in the developing world by ending violence against women and girls, stopping hate crimes against LGBT people, and ending child marriage. In recent years, AJWS has responded to the East Africa hunger crisis and the Rohingya refugee crisis by providing immediate humanitarian aid and long-term, sustainable support to affected populations.  Leadership  AJWS's current president and chief executive officer is Robert Bank. Bank has spent his career championing human rights as an attorney, activist and leader. He joined AJWS as executive vice president in 2009, and he had previously served in New York's municipal government and in the leadership of GMHC‚Äîone of the world's leading organizations combating HIV/AIDS. Robert has been honored with GMHC's Lifetime Achievement Award and the Partners in Justice Award from AVODAH: The Jewish Service Corps. Bank became president and chief executive officer in July 2016, succeeding Ruth Messinger, who presided over the organization for 18 years. Ruth Messinger was formerly Manhattan Borough President and the Democratic nominee for Mayor of New York City in 1997. In late 2005, The Forward named Messinger in its annual \\"Forward 50\\" list of the most influential American Jews. Messinger returned to the Forward 50 in 2009, also the year she was invited to the White House to discuss the crisis in Darfur with President Barack Obama. Currently, she sits on the United States State Department's Religion and Foreign Policy Working Group and co-chairs the Sub-Working Group on Social Justice. Impact AJWS provides over $38 million annually to 450 social justice organizations in 19 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, to address some of the gravest global problems, including genocide, AIDS, violence against women and girls, hatred of LGBT people, and consequences of natural and human-made disasters. Since its founding, AJWS has provided more than $360 million to support thousands of social justice organizations in the developing world that have taken on such challenges.

The eighth named storm of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season, Howard originated out of a tropical wave off the coast of Mexico on August 30\\\\. Traveling towards the northwest, the storm gradually strengthened, becoming a hurricane on September 1 and reaching its peak intensity the following day with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). Decreasing sea surface temperatures then caused the storm to weaken. By September 4, Howard was downgraded to a tropical storm. The next day, it degenerated into a non- convective remnant low pressure area which persisted for another five days before dissipating over open waters. Although the storm never made landfall, the fringe effects of the storm produced significant flooding across the Baja California Peninsula which damaged agricultural land and dozens of homes. Howard also produced large swells which reached 18 ft (5.4 m) along the Baja coastline and 10 ft (3 m) along the California coastline. About 1,000 lifeguard rescues took place in California due to the waves. Moisture from the storm also enhanced rainfall in parts of Arizona, leading to minor accumulations. Meteorological history Hurricane Howard began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on August 18\\\\. The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little associated convection. By August 26, the wave produced disorganized convection as it moved through the western Caribbean, across Central America, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean. Paralleling the southern coast of Mexico, the wave became increasingly organized and it was estimated that the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression around 1200 UTC on August 30 about 400 mi (645 km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. Classified as Tropical Depression Eleven-E, the system tracked west-northwestward under the steering currents of a weak mid-level ridge. In the hours after formation, the depression lacked a concentration of deep convection near the center. However, conditions favored eventual development, including warm sea surface temperatures and low amounts of wind shear. Based on increased organization and the formation of banding features, it was estimated that the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Howard at 0000 UTC on August 31. A mid-level anticyclone located over southern California was steering the storm towards the northwest. Early on September 1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that Howard had an 80 percent chance of undergoing rapid intensification based on further development of the storm and a highly favorable environment around the cyclone. Based on the formation of an eye feature, the NHC upgraded Howard to a hurricane early on September 1 while the storm was located about 420 mi (675 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. Later that day, the eye of Howard became apparent on satellite imagery, which organized into a pinhole eye surrounded by a ring of symmetric, deep convection. At 0600 UTC on September 2, Howard was upgraded to a major hurricane--a storm with winds of 111 mph (178 km/h) or higher. Shortly after, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) while located about 410 mi (660 km) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur. Hurricane Howard weakening on September 3 Not long after reaching peak intensity, the storm moved over cooler waters, causing the eyewall to deteriorate and cloud tops to warm. The next day, the eye of Howard disappeared from satellite imagery, leading to the cyclone being downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane. Continued deterioration of the system caused rapid weakening, with Howard being downgraded to a tropical storm by 1200 UTC on September 4. Convection associated with the storm was separated from the center later that day. Early on September 5, Howard was further downgraded to a tropical depression and later degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area about 265 mi (425 km) west-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. The remnants of the hurricane continued towards the northwest before turning towards the southwest the following day as it tracked along the southeast side of a ridge of high pressure. The low continued in this general direction until it dissipated on September 10 about 1,150 mi (1,850 km) west of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Preparations and impact Because Howard remained away from land no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued. One ship, the Strong Virginian, reported sustained winds 42 mph (68 km/h) at 0600 UTC on September 4. Along the Baja California Peninsula, 16-18 ft (4.8-5.4 m) swells were reported. All ships were required to remain at port due to the rough seas. Heavy rains in the mountainous and Pacific coastal areas of Baja California produced flooding which washed out several roads in San Jos√© del Cabo. The rains did help increase water levels in some reservoirs in Baja California. An estimated 2,000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged by the storm and 48 households were damaged throughout four communities. State and federal authorities purchased temporary homes for those who needed shelter in the affected areas. The State Civil Protection in Mexico provided rehabilitation for a total of 393 homes affected by Howard. Large swells produced by the storm resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in Orange County, California. High temperatures in southern California, exceeding 100 ¬∞F (37.7 ¬∞C) in places, and cool ocean temperatures led to an estimated 575,000 people going to beaches during the Labor Day weekend. One incident required 25 rescues as dozens of people were overwhelmed by 8-10 ft (2.4-3 m) waves. Officials in San Bernardino County advised residents to take precautions for the possibility of flooding as a result of moisture from the remnants of Howard. Following wildfires in 2003, foothills were highly susceptible to flooding. Residents were advised to have sandbags ready, ensure their emergency supplies were stocked and have an evacuation plan. Despite all the preparations undertaken, Howard did not produced any rainfall in California. The moisture also enhanced rainfall across portions of Arizona. This led to minor rainfall accumulations throughout the state.

Three species are named and described (Flower 1968) from the Garden City limestone of Whiterockian age near Logan and northern Utah, including the genotype Williamsoceras adnatum. Two other species come from the Juab limestone (Flower 1976) of near equivalent age in the southern Confusion Range in the Ibex area in western Utah.  Description Of the five described species the siphuncle wall and phragmocone are known only from the genotype Williamsoceras adnatum. The other four are known only from pieces of siphuncle which show only internal configurations, but closely resemble that of the genotype. Williamsoceras is characterized by a ventral process within the siphuncle that extends vertically from the bottom side, essentially bisecting the interior. The process is straight sided and narrow in the more forward part of the siphuncle, approaching the body chamber, and swells to a bulbous or teardrop shape in cross section closer to the apex of the siphuncle where it becomes draped by endocones. As the ventral process and endocones approach a crescent shape space is formed, known as the endosiphocone, the upper side being convex, the lower side concave. The septal necks, described only from the genotype, are macrochoanitic, extending 1.5 segments back from their origin. and is slightly sinuous in profile (Flower 1968, 1976) Comparisons Williamsoceras is similar to Cacheoceras which comes from the same areas and formations, except that Cacheoceras has additional smaller processes, either one on the dorsal side opposite the main process or a pair that are positioned dorsolaterally. It differs from Emmonsoceras (Flower 1955, 1976; Techert 1964) and from Perkinsoceras (Flower 1976) in that the ventral process in these is broad and in broad contact with the lower side of the siphuncle. Williamsoceras differs from Allotrioceras from the Chazian of Champlain Valley (Flower 1955) in the manner in which the central processes are formed and that the features in Willimasoceras are bilaterally symmetrical while those in Allotrioceras are definitely asymmetric.  Origin and classification Williamsoceras may have its origin in the Manchuroceratidae from the upper Canadian of northern China and Korea (Flower 1955, 1968, Teichert 1964) derived from the Proterocameroceratidae, by a lengthening of the septal necks. Williamsoceras is included in the suborder Proterocameroceratina and is closely related to the Emmonsoceratidae  References * Flower 1955; Status of Endoceroid Classification; Journal of Paleontology, V.29,n.3, May 1955, pp329‚Äì372 * Flower 1968; Some Additional Whiterock Cephalopods, Part II, Memoir 19, New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, Socorro.

He is mostly known for being the son of former Lebanese president-elect Bachir Gemayel. Early life and education Nadim Gemayel was born in Bikfaya on 1 May 1982 to Solange Gemayel (n√©e Toutounji), and Bashir Gemayel, a Maronite Christian from Bikfaya, Mount Lebanon. Nadim is the youngest to two sisters, Youmna (born 1980) and Maya (born 1978). Maya was only 18 months old when she was killed in 1980 by a car bomb that was intended for her father. Nadim Gemayel's father, Bachir Gemayel, was a prominent national leader in Lebanon and an elected President of the Republic in (1982). Bashir Gemayel was assassinated on 14 of September 1982, 21 days after being elected president. Nadim was only four months old when his father was killed. Following high school, Nadim Gemayel moved to France to pursue his law degree and graduated from Panth√©on-Assas University in 2004. He currently practices law with a prominent law firm which maintains offices in Lebanon and Qatar. In addition to his position inside the Kataeb party, Nadim Gemayel holds a seat in the Lebanese Parliament and serves as co-chairperson of the Bachir Gemayel Foundation, founded in 1982 following the assassination of his father. Political career Believing in what he says was his father's dream of freeing Lebanon from all foreign occupiers and unifying its people, Nadim Gemayel started his political struggle at a relatively young age. He has successfully secured a prominent position within the Kataeb Party in spite of many obstacles, and has won parliamentary elections in Achrafieh where he enjoys an undisputed popularity. Syrian Hegemony 1994-2005 Following Bashir Gemayel's assassination in 1982, Lebanon entered an era where Syrian control began, and culminated in 1990 with the Syrian takeover of the Presidential Palace of Baabda. Nadim Gemayel started his struggle against the Syrians by participating and leading Anti-Syrian demonstrations, organizing sit-ins with other Anti-Syrian factions inside the universities, and lobbying for Lebanon during his university years outside Lebanon. Nadim Gemayel's most notable appearances, apart from his annual speech, were during the MTV shutdown in 2002, where he was at the forefront of the demonstration to reopen the station, defying the Syrian-Lebanese security apparatus and almost got arrested, and the 2003 Baabda-Aley elections. Cedar Revolution 2005 The assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2005 triggered a series of demonstrations against the Syrian troops and the Lebanese security officials. Those demonstrations culminated on 14 March 2005, which was later on known to anti-Syrian factions as the \\"Cedar Revolution\\". Nadim Gemayel was present throughout the period and was among many Anti-Syrian political factions to set up a tent with their supporters in Martyrs' Square demanding the resignation of the government and the security officials, the complete and unconditioned withdrawal of Syrian troops and the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination of then- Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri and past political assassinations. Kataeb The Cedar Revolution was followed by an almost complete Syrian withdrawal on April 26, 2005 after international pressure chiefly by the Americans and Europeans. Despite the Syrian withdrawal, Syria was still present politically through its intelligence officers and the alliances with Lebanese factions it had established. Nadim Gemayel saw this as Lebanon's second independence and a historic opportunity to launch his political career officially and engage the Kataeb party, to fight Syrian security officials in Lebanon. On 26 April 2006, the Kataeb district in Achrafieh, after months of renovation, was opened and launched by Nadim Gemayel. The ceremony included a speech by Nadim Gemayel embodying his political beliefs and goals, and was finalized by a prayer and lighting candles on his father's memorial. Nadim Gemayel addressed the Lebanese and the Christians mainly urging them to unite under one banner to \\"build a sovereign state\\". He also stressed on Hezbollah's weapons, calling them illegitimate and asked that only the Lebanese armed forces carry weapons. He continued \\"We are with dialogue without any preconditions‚Ä¶ What we care for are Lebanon's people and the future of its youth.\\" Parliamentary Elections 2009 Nadim Gemayel decided to run for the Parliamentary elections in Beirut's first District (Ashrafieh, Rmeil, Sayfi) his main rival for the Maronite seat was Massoud Al Achkar. He ran as a Kataeb and March 14 candidate alongside Gebran Tueni's daughter Nayla Tueni. The election on 7 June 2009 was a very close race to the parliament, Nadim Gemayel won the Maronite seat in Beirut's first district and is now an MP in the new Lebanese Parliament. Nayla Tueni also won the Greek Orthodox seat in the same district.

He was one of the first Methodists to preach in Upper Canada, where his straightforward style of preaching that appealed to direct emotional connection to God allowed him to convert many of the inhabitants.  Early life and conversion  Wooster was born on 30 May 1771 in Woodbury, Connecticut.Osborn, 215 Around 1787, he moved with his family to Westerlo, New York.Sprague, 219 He was convicted of sin on 9 October 1791,Rawlyk (1994), 106 and subsequently became a born again Christian on 1 December 1791.Carroll, 46 Wooster's conversion was completed by sanctification on 6 February 1792.Rawlyk (1994), 106  Ministry  Wooster was accepted on trial for the Methodist itinerary at the 1793 conference, and assigned to ride the Granville Circuit in Massachusetts. After a few months on the Granville circuit, he was reassigned to the Pittsfield circuit. After another few months, he was again reassigned, this time to the Cambridge circuit.Osborn, 219 In 1794, Wooster was assigned to the Elizabeth Town Circuit in New Jersey.Carroll, Volume I, page 47 At the 1795 conference in White Plains, New York, Wooster's trial period was ended, and he was given his deacon's orders. That year he was assigned to the Columbia Circuit in New York.Osborn, 221 In 1796, Wooster volunteered to ride in Upper Canada, and was assigned to the Oswegotchie Circuit. He travelled north with fellow circuit rider Samuel Coate, reaching the quarterly meeting of the Upper Canada district after a twenty-one-day journey through a lightly populated wilderness. There Wooster met the presiding elder Darius Dunham. At the end of the day's public business, Dunham retired with the other conference leaders to discuss organisational matters. Wooster remained behind talking to those who remained in the meeting room, proselytizing to them that they should find full redemption in the blood of Christ. Many were quite stirred by his preaching, and shouting and praised God aloud, while others were so overcome with emotion that they fell prostrate to the floor. The commotion attracted the attention of Dunham, who rushed back to the meeting room to investigate. Dunham, a \\"fire and brimstone\\" preacher, was indignant to find many of the Methodists on the floor in emotional outburst. He began praying loudly, for God to put a stop to \\"the raging of the wild fire.\\" Wooster knelt beside him, and prayed \\"Lord Bless brother Dunham!\\" The pair prayed against each other for several minutes, before Dunham was overcome and also fell to the floor in emotional outburst. Afterwards, Dunham adopted much of the theological bent towards emotional preaching and theatrics of Wooster.Carroll, Volume I, page 48 Although Wooster was a preacher of significant faith and fervor, he had a poor constitution, and after circuiting riding in Upper Canada through June 1798,French, 2000 he returned to his parent home ill, suffering from tuberculosis,Rawlyk (1994), 109 and died on 6 November 1798.Carroll, Volume I, page 51 Circuit rider Lorenzo \\"Crazy\\" Dow visited Wooster on his deathbed, and was inspired to follow Wooster's example, and volunteer to be sent to Upper Canada. There he preached numerous sermons around Kingston, often centering on what he maintained were Wooster's last words: \\"Ye must be sanctified or damned\\".Rawlyk (1994), 111  Preaching style  Wooster preached in a simple, straightforward style, employing common language which allowed him to appeal widely to people unfamiliar with theology.Rawlyk (1993), 31 Where John Wesley had written that sanctification must come from solemn spiritual reflection, Wooster preached that sanctification was achieved by being smitten by God, which was a strong, emotional experience. As a consequence, Wooster was able to effectively preach to common folk not well acquainted with religious doctrine, and often induced emotional outbursts from his audience while preaching. Wooster employed a variety of theatrical devices in his preaching. At one Methodist meeting around the Bay of Quinte, an audience member was arranged to be disruptive, talking and swearing during the sermon. After some time, Wooster pointed at him and exclaimed \\"My God, smite him!\\", and the man dutifully dropped straight to the floor. In other cases, he would begin a sermon by descending a ladder, evoking Moses descending from the mount.Rawlyk (1993), 32  Notes   References   * Category:1771 births Category:1798 deaths Category:People from Woodbury, Connecticut Category:People from Westerlo, New York Category:Converts to Methodism Category:American Methodist clergy Category:Methodist circuit riders ","title":"Calvin Wooster"},{"id":"21610973","text":"Iais is a genus of isopod crustaceans.
