He served as a member of the U.S. Representative from Illinois from 1961 to 1964 and a judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County from 1964 until his death. Biography Finnegan was born in Chicago and attended the parochial schools. He graduated from St. Rita High School, and attended Loyola University Chicago and Northwestern University Law School. Finnegan graduated from DePaul University with a LL.B. degree in 1930. He was admitted to the bar in 1931 and practiced in Chicago. In 1939, Finnegan unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for municipal court judge. In 1945, he was appointed an assistant state's attorney for Cook County, and served until 1956. He served as an assistant city corporation counsel from 1956 to 1957. In 1960, Finnegan was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Illinois' 12th district. After redistricting, he was reelected from the 9th district in 1962. He served from January 1961 until resigning in December 1964. Finnegan ran in the newly-configured 9th district in 1962 because incumbent Sidney R. Yates won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator. In the general election, Yates was unsuccessful in his campaign against Republican incumbent Everett Dirksen. Finnegan was renominated for the US House in April 1964. Later that month, he nearly drowned while swimming at the Lake Shore Club. A lifeguard administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation for several minutes before he regained consciousness, and he was hospitalized for several days. Finnegan decided later in 1964 that he preferred to serve as a judge, while Yates desired to return to the U.S. House. In October 1964, Finnegan resigned the U.S. House nomination. Yates was chosen as his replacement and easily won the November election. Finnegan was nominated for judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County. He won his November 1964 election, then resigned from Congress shortly before the expiration of his term. Finnegan served on the bench from December 1964 until his death. Finnegan died at a Chicago hospital on February 2, 1971. He was buried at All Saints Catholic Cemetery and Mausoleum in Des Plaines, Illinois. Family Finnegan's first wife, Katherine, died in 1961. They were the parents of three daughters -- Sara, Moira, and Kathleen. In 1964, Finnegan married Iris McCreevey, who survived him.

Battle On the night of 26 August 1914, the Allies withdrew from Le Cateau to St. Quentin. With retreat all along the line, the commander-in-chief of the French forces, Joseph Joffre, needed the Fifth Army (General Charles Lanrezac) to hold off the German advance with a counter-attack, despite a separation from the French Fourth Army on the right flank and the continual retreat of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the left flank. The movement of the Fifth Army took most of 28 August, turning from facing north to facing west against St. Quentin. On 29 August the Fifth Army attacked St. Quentin with their full force. The Germans captured orders from a French officer and General Karl von B√ºlow, commander of the German 2nd Army had time to prepare. The attacks against the town by the XVIII corps was a costly failure but X and III corps on the right were rallied by the commander of I Corps, General Louis Franchet d'Esperey. Advances on the right were made against Guise and forced the Germans, including the Guard Corps, to fall back. That night, Joffre ordered Lanrezac to resume his retreat and destroy the bridges over the Oise as he fell back. The orders did not reach the Fifth Army until the morning of 30 August, and the retreat began several hours late. The move went unchallenged by the 2nd Army, which neither attacked nor pursued. B√ºlow found that the 2nd Army was separated by the Oise, which offered the possibility of enveloping the French attack with counter-attacks from both flanks. The risk that the French could exploit the gap between the inner flanks of the 2nd Army, led B√ºlow to choose a cautious policy of preventing the danger and ordered the corps on the inner flanks to close up and counter-attack the French X Corps. Later in the afternoon French attacks were repulsed and the 14th Division was ordered to advance from the Somme area to intervene in the battle. The divisional commander ignored the order to let the division rest and prepare for an advance on La F√®re to get behind the Fifth Army. Lieutenant-General Karl von Einem the VII Corps commander was overruled and all corps of the 2nd Army were ordered to attack and obtain a decisive victory. B√ºlow reported the battle to Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, supreme command of the German armies) by wireless as a victory but during the night, captured documents revealed that thirteen French divisions had attacked divisions. B√ºlow sent a staff officer to the 1st Army (General Alexander von Kluck), to request support for the attack on 30 August. Doubts emerged that the Guard Corps could attack in the morning due to exhaustion and the commander was authorised to withdraw behind the Oise if necessary; the possibility of enveloping the French left flank had passed and operations for local advantage were ordered for the morning. The French resumed the offensive on the morning of 30 August but managed only disjointed attacks which were repulsed; German counter-attacks began before noon. The terrain in the Oise valley was marshy, cut by deep streams and covered by underbrush, with rising ground beyond. German infantry made slow progress through extensive artillery bombardments by both sides. By early afternoon, aircraft reconnaissance reports showed that the French had begun to withdraw behind rearguards. B√ºlow ordered a pursuit by small infantry parties with field artillery, while the main force paused to rest, due to exhaustion and to concern that the fortress of La F√®re obstructed a general advance and would have to be masked while the 1st Army enveloped the French from the west and then attacked on 1 September.

Rectangular in shape and measuring approximately 7.8 by 2.1 kilometers, the West Baray is the largest baray at Angkor and one of the largest handcut water reservoirs on Earth, possessing a current maximum capacity of 12 to 14 billion gallons of water (53 million m3). Its waters are contained by tall earthen dikes measuring 39 feet in height. In the center of the baray is the West Mebon, a Hindu temple built on an artificial island. Construction of the baray probably began in the 11th Century during the reign of King Suryavarman IHigham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., and was finished later under King Udayadityavarman II. The Angkorian engineers who created the West Baray appear to have in places incorporated earlier construction. The east dike, for instance, appears to be largely a section of a dike that enclosed the capital city of King Yasovarman, which had the Phnom Bakheng temple at its center. In other places, the baray obliterated or submerged earlier human-made sites. The south dike, for instance, partially buried a brick pyramid temple, Ak Yum. And the western floor of the baray appears to have once been inhabited‚Äîarcheological work has found wall bases, steps, and pottery shards there. An inscription stele discovered in the area, dating from 713 A.D., offers further evidence of earlier settlement, defining rice fields that were offered to a queen Jayadevi. Early French experts believed the West Baray to have functioned as a vast holding tank for water that fed irrigation canals in dry times, allowing multiple crops of rice each year. Many later studies, however, theorize that the baray had mainly symbolic functions, serving as a vast earthly depiction of the Hindu Sea of Creation, with the West Mebon temple at its center. In modern times, an irrigation lock was built in the baray's southern dike, raising the water level and allowing provision of water to fields to the south. Today the baray retains water in its western end year- round. In the rainy season, water advances to the eastern dike. With clear, still waters, the baray today is a popular place for swimming and boat rides by local residents. It has occasionally served as a landing site for seaplanes. References * Rooney, Dawn.

The most important aspect of this idea is that human understanding is \\"state-dependent\\". For example, when one is angry, it is difficult to understand what it is like for one to be calm, and vice versa; when one is blindly in love with someone, it is difficult to understand what it is like for one not to be, (or to imagine the possibility of not being blindly in love in the future). Importantly, an inability to minimize one's gap in empathy can lead to negative outcomes in medical settings (e.g., when a doctor needs to accurately diagnose the physical pain of a patient), and in workplace settings (e.g., when an employer needs to assess the need for an employee's bereavement leave). Hot-cold empathy gaps can be analyzed according to their direction: #Hot-to-cold: People under the influence of visceral factors (hot state) don't fully grasp how much their behavior and preferences are being driven by their current state; they think instead that these short-term goals reflect their general and long-term preferences. #Cold-to-hot: People in a cold state have difficulty picturing themselves in hot states, minimizing the motivational strength of visceral impulses. This leads to unpreparedness when visceral forces inevitably arise. They can also be classified in regards to their relation with time (past or future) and whether they occur intra- or inter- personally: #intrapersonal prospective: the inability to effectively predict their own future behavior when in a different state. See also projection bias. #intrapersonal retrospective: when people recall or try to understand behaviors that happened in a different state. See retrospective hot-cold empathy gaps. #interpersonal: the attempt to evaluate behaviors or preferences of another person who is in a state different from one's own. The term hot- cold empathy gap was coined by Carnegie Mellon University psychologist, George Loewenstein. Hot-cold empathy gaps are one of Loewenstein's major contributions to behavioral economics. Visceral factors Visceral factors are an array of influences which include hunger, thirst, sexual arousal, drug cravings for the drugs one is addicted to, physical pain, and strong emotions. These drives have a disproportionate effect on decision making and behavior: the mind, when affected (i.e., in a hot state), tends to ignore all other goals in an effort to placate these influences. These states can lead a person to feel \\"out of control\\" and act impulsively. Memory Hot-cold empathy gap is also dependent on the person's memory of visceral experience. As such, it is very common to underestimate visceral state due to restrictive memory. In general, people are more likely to underestimate the effect of pain in a cold state as compared to those in the hot state. =The experiment= Nordgren, van der Pligt and van Harreveld (2006) assessed the impact of pain on the subjects performance on a memory test. In the assessment process, participants were questioned how pain and other factors affected their performance. =The result of experiment= The results revealed that those participants in the pain free or cold state undervalued the impact of pain on their performance. Whereas, participants undergoing pain, accurately measured the effect of pain on performance. Areas of study =Sexual desire= Implications of the empathy gap were explored in the realm of sexual decision-making, where young men in an unaroused \\"cold state\\" failed to predict that in an aroused \\"hot state\\" they will be more likely to make risky sexual decisions, (e.g., not using a condom). =Bullying= The empathy gap has also been an important idea in research about the causes of bullying. In one study examining a central theory that, \\"only by identifying with a victim‚Äôs social suffering can one understand its devastating effects,\\" Cites researchers created five experiments. The first four examined the degree to which participants in a game who were not excluded could estimate the social pain of participants who were excluded. The findings were that those who were not socially excluded consistently underestimated the pain felt by those who were excluded. A survey included in the study directed at teachers' opinions of school policy toward bullying found that those with an experience of social pain, caused by bullying, often rated the pain experienced by those facing bullying or social exclusion as higher than teachers who did not have such experience, and further, that teachers who had experienced social pain were more likely to punish students for bullying. =Addiction= George F. Loewenstein explored visceral factors related to addictions like smoking. The factors have to do with drive states which are essential for living ‚Äì for example, sleepiness and hunger. Loewenstein discovered that addicts mistakenly categorize their addiction as an essential living drive state due to a behavior disorder. From the findings emerged new discoveries about hot and cold empathy gap and its important role in drug addictions, such as smoking. In smokers A study done in year 2008 explored empathy gap within smokers. =The experiment= 98 smokers, from the age of 18 to 40 who smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day for their past 12 days and are not interested in quitting, were selected through paper advertisements. For the experiments, smokers were asked to shun smoking for two days. The participants started off from session one and then moved on to session two. # Session one: In this session, smokers were asked to only imagine themselves in pain. This was to encourage the participants to stimulate themselves with thoughts irrelevant to smoking. This led the experimenters to see if the participants were at either hot or cold stage of empathy gap. After the experimenters discovered the stage of the participants, experimenters did another experiment. The participants in the cold state were categorized in the controlled cue and were asked to remove a plastic cover of a tray after 20 seconds of the exposure of the plastic cover. Underneath was a tape roll. The participants were asked to stare at the tape roll and then were surveyed. The participants in the hot state were categorized in the smoking cue. They were asked to do similar ritual of removing the plastic cover but the only difference was underneath the plastic cover was a pack of cigarettes, a lighter and an ashtray. The participants were asked to pick up a cigarette, light it with the lighter and stare at it without smoking it and were later surveyed. Then they (both controlled and smoker participants) are asked the minimum amount of money needed to delay smoking. Both hot and cold staged participants are asked to state the minimum price amount they need to delay smoking \\"right now\\". # Session two: Then the participants were going through similar session as session one. The only difference was that for the participants in the smoking cue were asked to express their minimum price to delay smoking before and after removing the plastic cover off the tray. The participants were also informed that there will be a 50% chance that the compensation the participants expressed will be taken into consideration for their real compensation given at the end of the study. In the end, all participants were rewarded five dollars for their participation. =Results= \\"Willingness to accept craving\\" (WTAC) is a measurement based on the money that participants received for previous smoking research. The results indicate that the compensation demand increased from first session to the second session for those in controlled cue and decreased for those in the hot cue. =Influence in smoking= The cold cue participants under predicted their monetary compensation to delay smoking whereas the hot cue participants over predicted their monetary compensation. This shows the gap both groups in different stages of empathy. It can also lead to a prediction that they will be misinformed about high risk situations. For example, many smokers in parties will probably underestimate their consumption of smoking, however, the consumption may be higher than predicted for the smoker. Those who would like to quit smoking may find quitting easy, however during the time of quitting smoking, they might find it incredibly difficult to control the urge to smoke. High craving situations will lead to a higher chances for a person to smoke, whereas those who are not in the state of craving smoke will have no idea about how it is like to intensely crave smoking.  Power  The bargaining games conclude that if one is completely powerless, the one proposing the offer to the powerless will lack strategy. Thus, the powerless will ironically receive higher outcomes. This is because of the egocentric empathy gap. In general, people have difficulty taking perspectives of a typical situation and decision making. Often, attribution bias of false consensus is the reason why the overestimation of similar perspective occurs. = Van Boven experiment = Van Boven divided students in the experiment into sellers and buyers of the coffee mug. He collected the price that buyers are willing to pay and collected the price at which the sellers are willing to sell the mug. To test the empathy gap, the buyers of the coffee mug were also asked to predict the price that the sellers would have to offer.  Results  Prediction of the sellers and buyers were close to their own price proposed and depended on their own evaluation of the mug. This leads to a conclusion that empathy gap does exist since both parties were unable to evaluate the other party. When being the weaker party, an encouragement of being more strategic occurs since the weaker party fears that their outcome will be in threat. In fact, this leads to a decision more in favor of the weaker party.  General conclusion about the results  Further conclusion can be made about empathy gap and power: the weaker party often doesn't realize that being in a weaker party can actually give them more power to strategically think and make decision, leading to better outcomes. The weaker party has no idea what they are capable of doing. They convince themselves that being more powerful is often more advantageous. Whereas the powerful party lacks strategy and leads to a poor outcome. Trial of experiments that held different combinations of the ultimatum game was done. The trials lead to an ultimate conclusion that participants like to be more powerful than to be powerless. Since the reasoning is not necessarily true due to attribution bias of false consensus, the powerful ones didn't abuse their power. Even though an assumption of being powerful leads to power's abuse, in reality it calls for more pro-social behavior and responsibility.

The fluted gourd grows in many nations of West Africa, but is mainly cultivated in southeastern Nigeria and it is used primarily in soups and herbal medicines.Nwanna, Esther Emem, et al. \\"Antioxidant and Hepatoprotective Properties of Telfairia occidentalis Leaf (Fluted Pumpkin).\\" Thesis and Dissertations (Biochemistry) (2008): n. pag. <> Although the fruit is inedible, the seeds produced by the gourd are high in protein and fat, and can, therefore, contribute to a well-balanced diet. The plant is a drought-tolerant, dioecious perennial that is usually grown trellised. T. occidentalis is traditionally used by an estimated 30 to 35 million people indigenous people in Nigeria, including the Efik, Ibibio, and Urhobo.Akoroda, M. O. \\"Ethnobotany of Telfairia occidentalis (Curcurbitacae) among Igbos of Nigeria.\\" Economic Botany (1990): 29-39. However, it is predominantly used by the Igbo ethnic group, who continue to cultivate the gourd for food sources and traditional medicines.Okoli, Bosa E., and C. M. Mgbeogu. \\"Fluted Pumpkin, Telfairia occidentalis: West African Vegetable Crop.\\" School of Biological Sciences, University of Port-Harcourt 37.2 (1983): 145-49. Springer. A recurring subject in the Igbo‚Äôs folklore, the fluted gourd is noted to have healing properties and was used as a blood tonic, to be administered to the weak or ill. It is endemic to southern Nigeria, and was an asset to international food trades of the Igbo ethnic group. Structure The fluted gourd fruit is quite large; one study documented a range of in length, and an average of 9 cm in diameter. The same study found the seed count in larger gourds to reach upwards of 196 per fruit, typically measuring between 3.4 and 4.9 cm in length. In both the pistillate and staminate varieties, T. occidentalis flowers grow in sets of five, with creamy-white and dark red petals, contrasting with the light green colour of the fruit when young, and yellow when ripe. Dioecious flowering is most common in the fluted gourd, with very few documented cases of monoecious flowering Nutritional content Woman of Nigeria chopping ugu for soup. Considered an ‚Äúoil seed‚Äù, the fluted gourd is high in oil (30%). Shoots of T. occidentalis contain high levels of potassium and iron, while seeds are composed of 27% crude proteins and 53% fats.Aiyelaagbe, I.O.O, and A.A Kintomo. \\"Nitrogen Response of Fluted Pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis Hook. F) Grown Sole or Intercropped with Banana.\\" Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems 64 (2002): 231-35. The leaves contain a high amount of antioxidants and hepatoprotective and antimicrobial properties. The young shoots and leaves of the female plant are the main ingredients of a Nigerian soup, ofe egwusi. The large (up to 5 cm), dark-red seed is rich in fat and protein and can be eaten whole, ground into powder for a kind of soup, or made into a fermented porridge. Cultivation T. occidentalis is typically grown vertically on trestle-like structures; however, it can be allowed to spread flat on a field. A beneficial outcome of growing the gourd flat is the suppression of weeds, especially when intercropped with a tall, upright plant such as maize. The growing period begins in April or May when seeds are planted;Emebiri L. and Nwufo, M.,. \\"Pod Rots of Fluted Pumpkin (Telfairia Occidentalis Hook. F.) in Imo State, Nigeria.\\" International Biodeterioration (26)1. (1990): 63-68. the first leaves and shoots can be harvested after a month and can be collected every 2‚Äì4 weeks thereafter. Seeds are planted directly in the soil, typically in groups of three to increase output in a case of a failed germination. Fruit is typically harvested between October and December. The seeds are subsequently collected and dried; a portion of them are consumed, while the remainder are stored for the following planting season. Although dependent upon soil type, the fluted gourd is able to ratoon and subsequently produce many flushes of fruit over long periods. It is able to ratoon with the highest degree of success in well-drained soils. It is propagated using the seeds. Its seed is housed in another greater covering or hard shell which protects it from harm. It survives drought and can retain its life in the root even after many years. It is a creeping plant and grows well if staked with bamboo sticks. Storage Although the seeds of T. occidentalis store well, precautions must be taken when storing any portion of the plant, particularly if the gourd is to be stored whole. This is not a typical storage method, as the fluted gourd pod (the fruit itself) is highly perishable, and can only be stored up to 4 weeks. If the gourd is left intact and proper storage and shipping are not practiced, pod rot can manifest, even from small lesions, and cause serious damage to the entire fruit, rendering it unusable. Furthermore, care must be taken when storing the leaves, which rapidly lose nutritional and water content when stored improperly.Nwufo, M. I. \\"Effects of Water Stress on the Post-harvest Quality of Two Leafy Vegetables, (Telfairia occidentalis) and - Storage Pterocarpus Soyauxii during Storage.\\" J Sci Food Agric 64 (1994): 265-69. These loses can be reduced by storing harvested leaves in sealed, polyethylene bags, as well as at lower temperatures (2-4 ¬∞C). Pests and pathogens A major concern of buyers and sellers of fluted gourd is pod rot. Infection occurs most frequently during transport, although it can also arise before the plant is harvested, starting as a small lesion that creates an avenue for pathogens to penetrate the fruit.Emebiri L. and Nwufo, M.,. \\"Pod Rots of Fluted Pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis Hook. F.) in Imo State, Nigeria.\\" International Biodeterioration (26)1. (1990): 63-68. It is most common for the affected area to appear brown in colour, indicating a contamination by R. stolonifer or Erwina. However, the infected area may also appear black (indicating the presence of Aspergillis niger) or grey (B. theobromae). Other symptoms associated with the presence of these pathogens include softening of the pod tissue accompanied by a pungent odour, or watery fluid in the fruit. Pod rot can be reduced by avoiding damage to the fruit during harvest and transport. Uses The edible seeds can be boiled and eaten whole, or fermented and added to ogili.Badifu, Gabriel I.O. \\"Food Potentials of Some Unconventional Oilseeds Grown in Nigeria - a Brief Review.\\" Plant Foods for Human Nutrition 43.3 (1993): 211-24 The fluted gourd has been traditionally used by indigenous tribes as a blood tonic, likely due to its high protein content. Flour produced from the seeds can be used for high- protein breads.Giami, Sunday Y. \\"Effect of Germination on Bread-Making Properties of Wheat-Fluted Pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis) Seed Four Blends.\\" Plant Foods for Human Nutrition 58 (2003): 1-9. Furthermore, the shoots and leaves can be consumed as vegetables. When T. occidentalis is prepared for herbal medicine, it is used to treat sudden attack of convulsion, malaria, and anaemia; it also plays a vital and protective role in cardiovascular diseases.

By the 1980s, the Chersky Range was considered mostly a zone of continental rifting where the crust was spreading apart.\\"Geodynamics and Late Cenozoic Evolution of the Asia/Pacific Transitional Zone\\", in Tectonics, International Geological Congress Staff, 27th International Geological Congress, Published 1984 by VSP However, the current view is that the Chersky Range is mostly an active suture zone, a continental convergent plate boundary, where compression is occurring as the two plates press against each other.The Physical Geography of Northern Eurasia, ed. Maria Shahgedanova, published by Oxford University Press 2003 There is thought to be a point in the Chersky Range where the extensional forces coming from the north change to the compressional forces noted throughout most of the range. The Chersky Range is also thought to include a geologic triple junction where the Ulakhan Fault intersects the suture zone. Whatever the exact nature of the regional tectonics, the Chersky Range is a seismically active zone. It connects in the north with the landward extension of the Laptev Sea Rift, itself a continental extension of the Mid- Arctic Gakkel Ridge.

In rainy season, the waters of the 7,800-meter-long baray rise and the temple, located on a site higher than the baray's floor, becomes an island. Symbolism Khmer architects typically surrounded temples with moats that represent the Hindu sea of creation. The West Mebon, located amid waters so vast that they can seem like a real sea, takes this religious symbolism to the ultimate level. Architecture The temple was built to a square design, with sides measuring about 100 meters. Each side had three tower-passages crowned with stone lotus flowers and arrayed about 28 meters apart. In the center of the square was a stone platform linked to the eastern wall by a laterite and sandstone causeway. Today the platform, causeway and much of the east wall and towers remain; the other sides are largely gone, though their outlines in stone are visible when the baray's waters are low. There is no central sanctuary to be seen, though the platform may have supported some comparatively small structure in times past.

In 1936, the West Mebon yielded up the largest known bronze sculpture in Khmer art, a fragment of the reclining Hindu god Vishnu. The fragment includes the god's head, upper torso and two right arms. A local villager is said to have dreamt that an image of the Buddha was buried in the West Mebon and wished to be freed from the soil. Subsequent digging unearthed the statue of Vishnu. The Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan, who visited Angkor at the end of the 13th Century, wrote that the West Mebon had a large image of Buddha with cascading water. Zhou mistook the Vishnu statue for a Buddha image, and the West Mebon for the East Mebon.

The series takes place in Modern day Japan and follows a genius teenager named Kiyo Takamine and his Zatch Bell, a human-like being with supernatural powers. Creation and conception After Raiku's \\"Newtown Heroes\\" series in the Shonen Sunday Super ended, Raiku looked at his old drafts he created in the past for an idea for his next series. One of his ideas was about a mercenary who used a giant sword to defeat enemies. After playing with that idea for three months, Raiku decided to abandon it and go with another idea. His next idea was a story where a middle school student, the prototype of Kiyo, finds an old toy that turns into a giant knight that combats evil. After taking this up with his agent, he was advised to use a cuter character to fight and thus, Zatch was created. After Raiku worked on the idea for a month, it was published.

Astronauts lose an average of more than 1% bone mass per month spent in space. There is concern that during long-duration flights, excessive bone loss and the associated increase in serum calcium ion levels will interfere with execution of mission tasks and result in irreversible skeletal damage. History Bone loss has been observed during spaceflight since at least as early as Gemini in the 1960s. Although most early measurements of the amount of bone loss were not reliable, they did show bone loss in Gemini, Soyuz 9, Apollo, Skylab, Salyut 7, Mir, and the International Space Station. William E. Thornton, an astronaut and physician, was one of the biggest proponents of exercise as a way of preventing bone loss. Cause Bone remodels in response to stress in order to maintain constant strain energy per bone mass throughout. To do this, it grows more dense in areas experiencing high stress, while resorbing density in areas experiencing low stress. On Mars, where gravity is about one-third that of earth, the gravitational forces acting on astronauts' bodies would be much lower, causing bones to decrease in mass and density. Average bone loss of 1‚Äì2% was recorded in astronauts on Mir each month. This is in comparison to 1‚Äì1.5% bone loss in the elderly per year, and 2‚Äì3% in postmenopausal women. Countermeasures Sunita \\"Suni\\" Williams bungeed to the TVIS treadmill aboard the International Space Station. Since Gemini, exercise has been tried as a way of preventing bone loss, but it has not been shown to be successful. This may be in part due to lack of adequately designed studies (no controlled study had been done as of 2005, either in space or using bedrest as an attempt to simulate conditions which lead to bone loss). It is not known whether a different exercise regimen (perhaps including larger loads than past ones) would be effective. Increasing dietary calcium and vitamin D is a standard countermeasure for osteoporosis. Clay is reportedly used by NASA for retaining calcium.Ubick, Suzanne; Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud, The Magazine of the California Academy of Sciences, Apr. 3, 2008 A variety of drug remedies currently used or proposed for osteoporosis may work for spaceflight, including hormone therapy (estrogen or progestin), selective estrogen receptor modulators, bisphosphonates, teriparatide, and others. Whether they can provide the same benefits for spaceflight as they do for osteoporosis is not yet known.

The temple Map of Beng Mealea, from a drawing by Leon de Beylie (1849-1910). In red the partially equipped path used to visit the temple. Beng Mealea was built as a Hindu temple, but some carvings depict Buddhist motifs. Its primary material is sandstone and it is largely unrestored, with trees and thick brush thriving amidst its towers and courtyards and many of its stones lying in great heaps. For years it was difficult to reach, but a road recently built to the temple complex of Koh Ker passes Beng Mealea and more visitors are coming to the site, as it is 77 km from Siem Reap by road. The corridor in the temple. The history of the temple is unknown and it can be dated only by its architectural style, identical to Angkor Wat, so scholars assumed it was built during the reign of king Suryavarman II in the early 12th century. Smaller in size than Angkor Wat, the king's main monument, Beng Mealea nonetheless ranks among the Khmer empire's larger temples: the gallery which forms the outer enclosure of the temple is 181 m by 152 m.Rooney, 2005, pp.255-258 It was the center of a town, surrounded by a moat 1025 m by 875 m large and 45 m wide. Beng Mealea is oriented toward the east, but has entranceways from the other three cardinal directions. The basic layout is three enclosing galleries around a central sanctuary, collapsed at present. The enclosures are tied with \\"cruciform cloisters\\", like Angkor Wat. Structures known as libraries lie to the right and left of the avenue that leads in from the east. There is extensive carving of scenes from Hindu mythology, including the Churning of the Sea of Milk and Vishnu being borne by the bird god Garuda. Causeways have long balustrades formed by bodies of the seven-headed Naga serpent. It was built mostly of sandstone: Beng Mealea is only 7 km far from the angkorian sandstone quarries of Phnom Kulen, as the crow flies. Presumably sandstone blocks used for Angkor were transported along artificial water canals and passed from here. Despite of lack of information, the quality of architecture and decorations has drawn the attention of French scholars just from its discovery.

He has given three popular TED talks, including one of the 20 most-viewed talks of all time (as of December 2013). Beginning in 2013, Gilbert appeared in a series of Prudential Financial television commercials that used data visualization to get Americans to think about the importance of saving for their retirements. For example, in one advertisement, people were asked to put stickers on a time-line to indicate the age of the oldest person they knew to illustrate the recent increase in life expectancy. In another, Gilbert started a chain-reaction and set a Guinness World Record by toppling a domino to illustrate the power of compound interest. In a third, people put magnets on walls marked \\"Past\\" and \\"Future\\" to illustrate the optimism bias. = Books = * * = Scholarly Articles = Gilbert has also collaborated with other scholars on articles published in academic journals like Psychological Science, Social Cognition, and Current Directions in Psychological Science.  \\"How Happy Was I, Anyway?'

Domination of the Liburnian thalassocracy in the Adriatic Sea was confirmed by several Antique writers,M. Fluss, Liburni, PWRE, Suppl. Bd. V, 582M. Suiƒá, Granice Liburnije kroz stoljeƒáa, Radovi inst. JAZU, 2, Zadar 1955, 273 but the archeologists have defined a region of their material culture more precisely in northern Dalmatia, Kvarner and eastern Istria. Classical Liburnia The Liburnian cultural group developed at the end of the Bronze Age after the Balkan-Pannonian migrations, and during the Iron Age in a region bordered by Ra≈°a, Zrmanja and Krka rivers (Arsia, Tedanius, Titius), including the nearby islands.M.

Batoviƒá, Liburnska kultura, Matica Hrvatska i Arheolo≈°ki muzej Zadar, Zadar, 2005, , page 16 This territory lay mostly at the coast and on the numerous islands. Its continental borders were marked by the rivers and mountains: Ra≈°a, Uƒçka, Gorski Kotar, peaks of Velebit mountain (Mons Baebius), Zrmanja and Krka, with a small area northeast of Krka bordered by Buti≈°nica, Krka, Kosovƒçica and ƒåikola, around the city Promona (modern Tepljuh near Drni≈°). Thus, it neighbored in the northwest with the Histri, in the north with the Iapodian and in the southeast with the Dalmatian cultural groups.≈†. Batoviƒá, Liburnska grupa, Praistorija jugoslavenskih zemalja V, page 386 Liburnian culture had distinct features and differed considerably from those of its neighbors. Its isolation and special qualities resulted primarily from its geographical isolation from the hinterland and its seaward orientation, important for traffic circulation and territorial connection. Maritime focus shaped Liburnian ethnic development on the Indo-European basis with the transfer of Mediterranean cultural traditions into an independent ethnic community, separated from neighboring peoples, but having evident similarities and links with the wider Illyrian and Adriatic territories.≈†. Batoviƒá, Liburnska kultura, Matica Hrvatska i Arheolo≈°ki muzej Zadar, Zadar, 2005, , pages 5, 6, 95 The Liburnians' skillful seamanship allowed them to hold navigable routes along the eastern Adriatic coast with strategic points, such as the islands of Hvar and Lastovo in the central Adriatic and Corfu (8th century BC) in the Ionian Sea, while they already had colonies at the western Adriatic coast, especially in region of Picenum, from the beginning of the Iron Age. From the 9th to the 6th century there was certain koine - cultural unity in the Adriatic, with the general Liburninan seal, whose naval supremacy meant both political and economical authority in the Adriatic Sea through several centuries.M. Zaninoviƒá, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43-67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13)>>65<<, page 47 Liburnian territory in cca 5th century BC According to Strabo (VI, 269), the Liburnians were masters of the island Korkyra (Corfu), until 735 BC, when they left it, under pressure of Corinthian ruler Hersikrates, in a period of Corinthian expansion to South Italy, Sicily and Ionian Sea. However their position in the Adriatic Sea was still strong in the next few centuries. Historian Theopompus (377-320 BC) informed about the island groups in the Adriatic Sea: Apsartides (Cres and Lo≈°inj), Elektrides (Krk), while all the others were the Liburnian islands - Liburnides, from Zadar archipelago to Ladesta (Lastovo) in the south, including Paros (Hvar). Geographer Scymnus (4th century BC) noted that Greek island of Paros had a namesake in the Adriatic Sea, Liburnian island of Paros (Hvar); this name was later changed to Pharos, according to Strabo (VII, 5). Scymnus specially noted the island group Mentorides (Arba - Rab and Cissa - (Pag). Old Greek sources never noted any Liburnian settlement in the northern coasts, possibly because the ancient mariners had been using only outer island channels for navigation towards the beginning of the Amber Road in the north of Adriatic, evading inner seas which were ruled by Liburnian thallasocracy.M. Bleƒçiƒá, Prilog poznavanju antiƒçke Tarsatike, VAMZ, 3.s., XXXIV 65-122 (2001), UDK 904:72.032 (3:497.5), page 69 Alexandria's librarian Apollonius of Rhodes (295 ‚Äì 215 BC) yet described the islands, Issa (Vis), Diskelados (Braƒç) and Pitiea (Hvar) as Liburnian. But by the 1st century AD Pliny the Elder includes in the island group Liburnicae only the archipelagos in Zadar and ≈†ibenik aquatories, Gissa (Pag), Sissa (Sestrunj), Scardagissa (≈†karda), Lissa (Ugljan and Pa≈°man), Colentum (Murter), island groups Celadussae (Dugi Otok), Crateae, and several other minor ones, though their municipalities occupied islands to the north, Curycta (Krk), Arba (Rab), Crepsa (Cres), Apsorus (Lo≈°inj). Archaeology has confirmed that the narrow region of the Liburnian ethnic nucleus was at the eastern Adriatic coast between Krka and Ra≈°a rivers, in \\"Classical Liburnia\\", especially between Krka and Zrmanja rivers, where the material remains of their culture and settlements were the most frequently distributed, while their cities were urbanized at certain degree even in pre- Roman ages. By the material remains it's obvious that they didn't settle the eastern Adriatic coast to the south-east of Krka river; their supremacy on the islands to the south of their ethnic region should not be understood necessarily as their ethnic dominion in the southern Adriatic archipelagos (Hvar, Braƒç, Vis, Lastovo, etc.), but rather as their organized military-naval region based on the island outposts, by which they maintained control of the navigable route to the south.M.

They lost their trade colonies in the Western Adriatic coast due to invasion of the Umbri and the Gauls, caused by expansion of the Etruscan union in the basin of Po river. The 5th century BC saw Greek colonization in the south Adriatic, and final Liburnian retreat to Liburnia was caused by military and political activities of Dionysius the Elder of Syracuse in the 4th century BC. Liburnia was strongly held, but Greek colonization reached Liburnian strategic possessions in the central Adriatic, Issa (on the island of Vis) and Pharos (Starigrad, Hvar), a colony of the Greeks from Paros.M.

Stipƒçeviƒá, Iliri, ≈†kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1974, page 39 previously held by Iapodes, thus making the Histri their new neighbors to the west. On the basis of ancient records, the Iapodes inhabited the coast between Albona (Labin) and Lopsica (Sv. Juraj, south from Senj) and island Curycta (Krk) to the end of the 4th century BC.

By that time the Romans were already engaged in centuries long wars against Liburnian neighbors, Histri, Dalmatae and other Illyrians. Roman Liburnia When Roman force ended the independence of their naval force in 33 BC, the Liburnians lost their freedom and Liburnia became a part of the Roman province of Dalmatia, but marginal in a military sense. Burnum on the Krka river became a Roman military camp, while the frequently settled and already urbanized plains of Classical Liburnia, in the inland of Iader (Zadar), became easily accessible and controlled by the Roman rulers. However Liburnian seamanship tradition was never wiped out, but became primarily trade-oriented under the new circumstances, a shift which contributed to the economic and cultural flourishing of its ports and cities, as well as to those of the province in general. Despite the process of Romanization that especially affected some of the bigger cities, the Liburnians saved their traditions, cults, typical funeral monuments (Liburnian cipus), names etc., as attested by the archaeological material from those ages.M.

Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) gave a detailed geography of Liburnia, noting their tetradekapolis political-regional organization, 14 Liburnian municipalities subject to Scardona (Skradin). Worth mention were Lacinienses (unknown), Stulpinos (unknown Stulpi), Burnistas (Burnum), Olbonenses (unknown), those who enjoyed Italic law (Ius Italicum) were Alutae (Alvona - Labin), Flanates (Flanona ‚Äì Plomin, the gulf of Kvarner was named by them - sinus Flanaticus), Lopsi (around the strategic pass of Vratnik and the town of Lopsica ‚Äì Sv. Juraj, south from Senj), Varvarini (Varvaria ‚Äì Bribir), tribute immunity was given to Asseriates (Asseria ‚Äì Podgraƒëe near Benkovac) and to the islanders Fertinates (*Fulfinates, Fulfin(i)um - Omi≈°alj on Krk) and Curictae (Curicum, Krk). He listed the cities along the coast from north to the south: Alvona (Labin), Flanona (Plomin), Tarsatica (Trsat; in Rijeka), Senia (Senj), Lopsica (Sv. Juraj, south from Senj), Ortoplinia (probably Stinica, in Velebit), Vegium (Karlobag), Argyruntum (Starigrad), Corinium (Karin Donji), Aenona (Nin), civitas Pasini (in Ra≈æanac ‚Äì Vinjerac ‚Äì Posedarje range), important island cities Absortium (Apsorus ‚Äì Osor), Arba (Rab), Crexi (Cres), Gissa (Cissa, Caska near Novalja, Pag), Portunata (Novalja, older was Gissa portu nota ‚Äì Cissa known by its port Novalja), by the coast colonia Iader (Zadar with status of Roman colony), Colentum insula (Murter, city and island).S. ƒåaƒçe, Broj liburnskih opƒáina i vjerodostojnost Plinija(Nat. hist. 3, 130; 139-141), Radovi Filozofskog fakulteta u Zadru, 32, Zadar 1993., pages 1-36 Liburnia was a part of the Roman Empire until its collapse in 476 AD. During the reign of Augustus, the border between the Liburnians and Histri was Arsia river in Istria. In 170 AD a part of north-western Liburnian periphery that included the city Tarsatica (Trsat) was cut off from Liburnia. The new border was by Vinodol‚Äôs synclinal not northern from modern Crikvenica.M. Suiƒá, Zadar u starom vijeku, Filozofski fakultet u Zadru, Zadar, 1981, pages 225-228 From the middle of the 2nd century AD, the name \\"Liburnia\\" was used not only for the territory settled by the Liburnians, but also for previously \\"Iapodian\\" territory in official usage; the Iapodians were included with the Liburnians to the court jurisdiction county of Scardona (Skradin), one of the convent seats in the provinces of Dalmatia. By the end of 330s AD, Liburnia was administratively attached to Dalmatia. However, it was still treated and recognized as a special and different area.J. Medini, Provincia Liburnia, Diadora, vol. 9, Zadar, 1980, page 433 Medieval Liburnia After the fall of the Roman Empire and probably already from 490 AD, Liburnia within Dalmatia passed to the rule of the Ostrogoths, which lasted for six decades. The region of Savia was administratively added to the Gothic province of Dalmatia; the capital city of the both provinces was Salona (Solin), a seat of the ruler \\"comes Dalmatiarum et Saviae\\".A. Ugle≈°iƒá, Nakit istoƒçnih Gota na podruƒçju rimske provincije Dalmacije, Hrvati Goti, Marjan tisak, Split, 2003, pages 17-18, 99-100 The Goths lost the most of Dalmatia and a part of Liburnia in the south-east around Skradin in 536 AD, in war against the Byzantine emperor Justinian the Great who started it to reconquer the territories of the former Western Empire (see Gothic War), while a part of Liburnia in Ravni Kotari with Zadar surrendered to the Byzantines in 552 AD.S. Antoljak, Zadar pod vla≈°ƒáu istoƒçnih Gota, Zadarska revija, XX/1971, pages 139-146 However, northern Liburnia and the rest of Classical Liburnia remained in the Gothic hands until 555 AD; after Byzantine conquest of Savia (540 AD) and Istria (543 AD) it was organized to special administrative-territorial unit of the Gothic state, known as \\"Liburnia Tarsatica\\", military province directly subject to comes Gotharum settled in Aquilea.N. Klaiƒá, Povijest Hrvata u srednjem vijeku, page 16 This \\"military-naval\\" region, protected by heavy fleet, became a barrier to the Byzantine army step to Lika and Gorski Kotar, keeping safe continental road route over Tarsatica to Aquileia and northern Italy. According to anonymous Cosmographer of Ravenna (6th or 7th century), Liburnia Tarsatica considered all coastal cities from Albona (Labin) to Elona (Aenona, Nin) of Classical Liburnia and Iapodian settlements in the inland (Lika).M. Suiƒá, Liburnia Tarsaticencis, Adriatica prehistorica et antique, Zbornik G. Novak, Filozofski fakultet u Zagrebu, Zagreb, 1970, pages 706-716J. Medini, Provincia Liburnia, Diadora, vol. 9, Zadar, 1980, pages 395, 414 From 550 and 551 AD, the Slavs (Sclabenoi) started to break into Illyria and Dalmatia, as recorded by Procopius; by some thinking it was beginning of Slavic colonization there, which lasted during the next few centuries. Initial ethnic nucleus under Croatian name originated in Liburnian inland from where it soon spread to all Liburnia and from there to the other regions of former Illyricum province. In the pre-Roman ages, the Liburnians had been organized in 14 municipalities (tetradekapolis), the Croats probably used existing Illyrian municipality structure and had 14 ≈æupanijas, Old Croatian political-jurisdictional forms (municipalities), as reported by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, while many of twelve Old Croatian tribes were settled in Liburnia. In the next centuries Croatian language overlaid Dalmatian language spoken in Liburnia and DalmatiaI. Mu≈æiƒá, Hrvatska povijest IX stoljeƒáa, Naklada Bo≈°koviƒá, Split, 2007, page 117, 145 and already by the end of the 9th century, in the islands of Zadar aquatory, more than 70% of toponyms were Slavic forms.Nada Klaiƒá, Ivo Petricioli, Pro≈°lost Zadra ‚Äì knjiga II, Zadar u srednjem vijeku do 1409., Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1976, page 59 From the 6th to 9th century, names Liburnia and Dalmatia were continually used for separate specifics in the sources, not necessarily meaning that Liburnia was a separate political unit, but it was certainly used as for Classical Liburnia territorial range. At the end of the 8th century Charlemagne conquered Pannonia and Dacia, then Istria, Liburnia and Dalmatia, but the main littoral Liburnian and Dalmatian cites, however, remained under Byzantine control, organized to a Dalmatian archonty with Jadera (Zadar) in status of a provincial metropolis. The most of Liburnia was under direct Frankish rule (king, Friulian duke) and separated from Croatian Principality of Dalmatia until 820 AD. By some suppositions, Croatian prince Borna was a Frankish vassal sent from Liburnia to Dalmatia to organize it into a vassal state to the Frankish Empire; in 820 AD, Louis the Pious rewarded him for his merits and devotion, by giving also Liburnia to his jurisdiction. Borna enjoyed a title of \\"dux Dalmatiae atque Liburniae\\".I. Mu≈æiƒá, Hrvatska povijest IX stoljeƒáa, Naklada Bo≈°koviƒá, Split, 2007, pages 82, 83 After Borna, Croatian rulers replaced \\"Liburnia\\" with \\"Croatia\\" in their titles and continually after reign of Dr≈æislav (969-997) they were the kings of \\"Dalmatia and Croatia\\";I. Guberina, Dr≈æavna politika, I., page 158 thus geographical name Liburnia has disappeared from official use and has been further used only for a historical land. Later usage of the name Liburnia In later phases of the Middle Ages, the name Liburnia was used periodically to refer to the eastern coast of Istria and northern Dalmatia around the plain of Zadar. In recent times this name has been replaced by the Italian Quarnero and the Croatian Kvarner, names which refer to the northern Adriatic islands and the adjacent coast of Istria and Dalmatia. Currently, the name Liburnia persists only in poetic usage and to indicate hotels and ships in the Adriatic.

According to legend they populated Kerkyra until shortly after the Corinthians settled the island, c. 730 BC. History =Classic age= Liburnian territory during the 5th century BC The first account of the Liburni comes from Periplus or Coastal passage, an ancient Greek text of the mid 4th century BC.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes,1996, page 94 The fall of Liburnian domination in the Adriatic Sea and their final retreat to their ethnic region (Liburnia) were caused by the military and political activities of Dionysius the Elder of Syracuse (406 ‚Äì 367 BC). The imperial power base of this Syracusan tyrant stemmed from a huge naval fleet of 300 tetreras and penteras. After he ended Carthaginian authority in Sicily, he turned against the Etruscans. He made use of the Celtic invasion of Italy, and the Celts became his allies in the Italian peninsula (386 - 385 BC). This alliance was crucial for his politics, then focusing on the Adriatic Sea, where the Liburnians still dominated. In light of this strategy, he established a few Syracusan colonies on the coasts of the Adriatic Sea: Adria at the mouth of Po river and Ancona at the western Adriatic coast, Issa on the outermost island of the central Adriatic archipelago (island of Vis) and others. Meanwhile, in 385-384 BC he helped colonists from the Greek island of Paros to establish Pharos (Starigrad) colony on the Liburnian island of Hvar, thus taking control of the important points and navigable routes in the southern, central and northern Adriatic. The name of the Vindelician town of Cambodunum (today Kempten) is apparently derived from the Celtic cambo dunon: \\"fortified place at the river bend\\" .Cambodunum has obvious similarities to the Old Irish camb or camm \\"crooked\\" and d√∫n \\"fort\\". One classical source, Servius' commentary on Virgil's Aeneid,Servius' commentary on Virgil's Aeneid i. 243. says on the contrary that the Vindelicians were originally Liburnians ‚Äì a non-Celtic Indo-European people from the northeastern shores of the Adriatic (modern Croatia). This caused a simultaneous Liburnian resistance on both coasts, whether in their ethnic domain or on the western coast, where their possessions or interests were in danger. A great naval battle was recorded a year after the establishment of Pharos colony, by a Greek inscription in Pharos (384 ‚Äì 383 BC) and by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (80 ‚Äì 29 BC), initiated by conflicts between the Greek colonists and the indigenous Hvar islanders, who asked their compatriots for support. 10,000 Liburnians sailed out from their capital Idassa (Zadar), led by the Iadasinoi (people of Zadar), and laid siege to Pharos. The Syracusan fleet positioned in Issa was informed in time, and Greek triremes attacked the siege fleet, taking victory in the end. According to Diodorus, the Greeks killed more than 5,000 and captured 2,000 prisoners, ran down or captured their ships, and burned their weapons in dedication to their god. This battle meant the loss of the most important strategic Liburnian positions in the centre of the Adriatic, resulting in their final retreat to their main ethnic region, Liburnia, and their complete departure from the Italic coast, apart from Truentum (nowadays on the border between Marche and Abruzzo). Greek colonization, however, did not extend into Liburnia, which remained strongly held, and Syracusan dominance suddenly diminished upon the death of Dionysius the Elder. The Liburnians recovered and developed piracy to secure navigable routes in the Adriatic, as recorded by Livius for 302 BC.M. Zaninoviƒá, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43‚Äì67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) ¬ª65¬´, pages 49 -53 The middle of the 3rd century BC was marked by the rise of an Illyrian kingdom in the south of the Adriatic, led by king Agron of the Ardiaei. Its piratical activities imperiled Greek and Roman interests in the Adriatic, and caused the first Roman intervention on the eastern coast in 229 BC; Florus (II,5) noted the Liburnians as the Romans' enemies in this expedition, while Appian (Bell. Civ., II, 39) noted liburnae as swift galleys the Romans first fought with when they entered the Adriatic. The Liburni were allies of their southern Illyrian compatriots, Ardiaei and the others, but from the lack of more records related to them in the 3rd century BC, it is assumed that they mostly stood aside in the subsequent Roman wars and conflicts with Pyrrhus, Carthage, Macedonia and the southern Illyrian state.M.

In 177 BC they conquered Istria to the north of the eastern Adriatic coast, settled by tribe of Histri, while the Iapodes, the northern neighbors of Liburnia, attacked Aquileia in 171 BC. These incidents did not involve Liburnian territory. The Liburnians probably avoided direct conflict with the Romans in order to safeguard their remaining naval activities. After their arrival to the west of Liburnia, Roman legions also appeared on its southern borders, defeating the southern Illyrians and finally king Gentius in 167 BC, and during wars against the tribe of Dalmatae in 156‚Äì155 BC. The first Roman appearance in Liburnian waters occurred in 129 BC, during the military expedition of the Roman consul Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus against the Iapodes, which ended with hard-won victories over the Iapodes, Carni, Taurisci and Liburnians. In 84 BC, the Roman consuls enemies of Sulla mobilized an army in Italy and tried to use Liburnian territory, probably some outer island, to organize a military campaign back into Italy, against Sulla. This failed owing to bad weather and the low morale of the soldiers, who massively escaped to their homes in Italy, or refused to cross the sea to Liburnia. The Roman legions once again passed through Liburnian territory, probably by sea along the coast, in their next expedition against the Dalmatae (78‚Äì76 BC), started from the north, from Aquileia and Istria, to stabilize Roman control of the Dalmatian city Salona.M. Zaninoviƒá, \\"Liburnia Militaris\\", Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43‚Äì67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) ¬ª65¬´, pages 53-55 In 59 BC, Illyricum was assigned as a provincia (or zone of responsibility) to Julius Caesar, and the main Liburnian city of Iadera was nominally proclaimed a Roman municipium, but the real establishment of the Roman province occurred no earlier than 33 BC. The Dalmatae soon recovered and entered into conflict with the Liburnians in 51 BC (probably over possession of the pasture grounds around the Krka river), taking their city Promona. The Liburnians were not strong enough to reconquer it alone, so they appealed to Caesar, then the Roman proconsul of Illyricum. However, the Liburnian army, strategically supported by the Romans, was heavily defeated by the Dalmatae.M. Zaninoviƒá, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43‚Äì67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) ¬ª65¬´, pages 55, 56 The civil war between Caesar and Pompey in 49 BC affected all of the Roman Empire, as well as Liburnia. In that year, near the island of Krk, there was an important naval battle between the forces of Caesar and Pompey, involving local Liburnian support to both sides. Caesar was supported by the urban Liburnian centres, like Iader, Aenona and Curicum, while the rest of Liburnia supported Pompey, including the city of Issa where residents objected to Caesar's support for the Dalmatae in Salona. The \\"Navy of Iader\\" (Zadar) which may have included both Liburnian and Roman ships, confronted the \\"Liburnian navy\\" in service to Pompey, equipped with only Liburnians in their liburnae galleys. Caesar rewarded his supporters in Liburnian Iader and Dalmatian Salona with the status of Roman colonies, but the battle was won by the Liburnian navy, prolonging the civil war, and ensuring control of the Adriatic to the side aligned with Pompey over the next 2 years until his final defeat in 48 BC. In the same year, Caesar sent his legions to take control of the rebellious Illyricum province, and took the fortress of Promona from Dalmatian hands, making them submit.The provinces of the Roman Empire: from Caesar to Diocletian, Tome 1, by Theodor Mommsen, William Purdie Dickson, Francis Haverfield,2004, page 10,\\"the Dalmatians, who had for a number of years been in arms against the Romans, were forced to submit after the fall of their fortress Promona\\" Throughout this time, Roman rule in Illyricum province, largely nominal, was concentrated in only a few cities on the eastern Adriatic coast, such as Iader, Salona and Narona. Renewed Illyrian and Liburnian piracy motivated Octavian to organize a great military operation in Illyricum province in 35 BC, to finally stabilize Roman control of it. This action was first concentrated on the coastal Illyrian tribes to the east of Narona, then was expanded along the depth of Illyrian territory, where continental tribes gave much stronger resistance. After returning from the inland areas of Illyricum, Octavian destroyed the Illyrian pirate communities on the islands of Melita (Mljet) and Korkyra Nigra (Korƒçula), and continued to Liburnia, where he wiped out the last remnants of the Liburnian naval forces, thus resolving the problems of their renewed piratical activities in the bay of Kvarner (sinus Flanaticus) and their attempt to secede from Rome. Octavian commandeered all the Liburnian ships. Very soon these galleys would play a decisive role in the battle near Actium. Octavian made another expedition inland against the Iapodes from the Liburnian port of Senia (Senj), and conquered their most important positions in 34 BC. Over the next 2 years the Roman army, led by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, fought hard battles with the Dalmatae. The Liburnians were not recorded as participants in this war, but their southernmost territories were surely involved.M. Zaninoviƒá, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc.

Zaninoviƒá, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43-67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) ¬ª65¬´, page 59 Over the centuries, naval power was the most important aspect of warfare for the Liburni. After the empowered Roman forces defeated the Liburni, the region became part of the Roman province of Dalmatia, but it was considered marginal in a military sense. Burnum on the Krka river became a Roman military camp, while the plains of Liburnia proper inland from Iader, already urbanized, now became easily accessible to control by Roman rulers. However, Liburnian seafaring tradition was not extinguished; it rather acquired a more commercial character under the new circumstances as Liburnia's ports and cities thrived economically and culturally. Despite Romanization, especially in the larger cities, Liburnians retained their traditions, cults, burial customs (Liburnian cipus), names, etc., as attested by the archaeological evidence from that era.M. Zaninoviƒá, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43-67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) ¬ª65¬´, pages 59, 60 Archaeology The development of Liburnian culture can be divided into 3 main time periods: *11th and 10th centuries BC. Between two waves of Balkan-Pannonian migrations, this was a transitive period between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, with features more related to the Late Bronze Age. It was characterized by the influence of the Urnfield Culture that spread in the Pannonian areas, in addition to the general changes caused by the Balkan-Pannonian migrations. *9th to the 5th centuries BC. Liburnian domination in the Adriatic Sea; its first phase (9th century BC), because of the aforementioned migrations, did not continue the developments of the Late Bronze Age, except in certain forms. This was the beginning of the Liburnian Iron Age, marked by their expansion and colonization of Picenum, Daunia and Apulia on the Italic shores. The establishment of colonies resulted in a highly developed and rich culture based on naval trade, in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. This was followed by isolation from the Balkan area, except from Iapodia. The lucrative exchange of materials with the opposite coast was continued in the 6th century BC, and its connection to Picenum remained strong, and links to Iapodes and Dalmatae have also been attested. In the 5th century BC, the Greeks undertook the leadership of trade in the Adriatic and considerable changes resulted, such as the importing of a wider range of Greek products. *5th to the 1st centuries BC. Decline of Liburnia's power; Liburnian culture was thoroughly under Hellenic influence, although specifically local cultural aspects were retained. Apart from the extended importation of Hellenistic and Italic pottery, and other lesser influences, Liburnian cultural relations with other peoples were rather poor. =Settlements= The principal forms of settlements were forts (Latin: castellum, Croatian: gradina) built for defense, usually on elevations and fortified with dry walls. In Liburnian territory, about 400 have been identified so far, but they were considerably more numerous. About a hundred names of these hill-forts have kept their roots from prehistory, especially places that had been inhabited permanently, such as Zadar (Iader), Nin (Aenona), Nadin (Nedinium), Rab (Arba), Krk (Curicum), etc. The dwellings were square, dry-wall, ground-floor buildings of one room. Similar stone houses are preserved in Croatian tradition all over Dalmatia and Kvarner, mostly of the rounded form called bunja. =Burial tradition= The Liburnians buried their dead in graves near or beneath settlements. It is known that they laid their dead on one side in a contracted position, mostly in chests of stone slabs. Tumuli are numerous all over Liburnian territory, especially in the heartland of Liburnia proper (Nin, Zaton, etc.). Although most grave sites were from the beginning of the Iron Age, many were continually used in the Copper Age or from the Early Bronze Age to the end of the Iron Age. Inhumation under tumuli as practiced in Liburnian territory was undoubtedly inherited from earlier times. =Material culture= The transitory remains of culture are represented by various artifacts, mostly jewellery, pottery, and pieces of costume. Other forms are less common, such as weapons, tools etc. Especially numerous are fibulae, some twenty forms and many more variants, as well as ornamental pins. Small sculptures representing animals and people are fairly common. Various coins from 23 mints beginning from the 6th and especially the 3rd century have been found in former Liburnian territory, from Greek cities, colonies, Italian cities, Illyrian rulers, North African, Celtic and Roman. Bronze and glass vessels occur very rarely. Pottery is found mostly in settlements and tumuli, but it rarely occurs in tombs, except in rare tombs of Hellenistic type. Pottery was made without throwing, with a mixture of calcite, and burnt on an open fire. Imported pottery is also common, especially from southern Italy, from the 8th to 1st centuries BC; mostly Apulian vessels, but also some Greek pottery was imported. =Religion= The mythology of the people of Illyria is only known through the mention of Illyrian deities on Roman Empire period monuments, some with interpretatio Romana.Wilkes, J.J. The Illyrians, 1992, p. 245, . \\"...Illyrian deities are named on monuments of the Roman era, some in equation with gods of the classical pantheon (see figure 34).\\" There appears to be no single most prominent Illyrian god, and there would have been much variation between individual Illyrian tribes. The Illyrians did not develop a uniform cosmology on which to center their religious practices.Wilkes. \\"Unlike Celts, Dacians, Thracians or Scythians, there is no indication that Illyrians developed a uniform cosmology on which their religious practice was centred. An etymology of the Illyrian name linked with serpent would, if it is true, fit with the many representations of...\\" Iutossica and Anzotica, the latter identified with Venus, were worshipped in Liburnia. Bindus, identified with Neptune, was worshiped among the Japodes as the guardian deity of springs and seas. =Economy= Liburnia's economy relied on its strength in the sectors of agriculture, stock breeding, crafts, trade, barter, seamanship, fishing, hunting, and food collecting. The Liburnians traded over the whole of the Adriatic, and into the Middle and Eastern Mediterranean and the northwestern Balkan peninsula. They exported mostly to the territories of the Iapodes and Dalmatae, and across the Adriatic to Picenum and southern Italy, especially the commodities of jewellery, cheese, clothing, etc., and they imported mostly from Italy, primarily pottery, and various adopted coins. Importation of amber from the Baltic cannot be proven, but acquisitions likely occurred in Liburnian territory. =Social relations= Insights into social relations are possible by means of cultural relics, Roman-era inscriptions, and the works of several authors. Mention of the special role of women in Liburnian society can be noted in their writings. They describe the original division into several tribes and territorial communities, later fused into a union of tribes and a single ethnic community of Liburnians. Social relations were based on the structure of family and clan. Collections of tumuli correspond to this; there were up to 18 graves in a tumulus through several generations, or individual interments, with up to 8 bodies in each grave. Certain data suggest social division, stratification, and inequality, where the Liburnian aristocracy maintained many privileges, special status, and features of their culture under Roman rule. =Relations to other cultures= Liburnian culture mainly developed on the basis of inheritance and independent development, partly through foreign influence, particularly Italic and Hellenic, as well as through the imports of foreign goods. Links with the Pannonian basin were fewer than in Late Bronze Age. Much more important were links with the Iapodes, and especially with the Dalmatae. Histrian culture developed differently, and their links with the Liburnians were less general. The exchange with Italy was varied and important. The Liburnians had the most versatile relationships with Picenum and southern Italy because of Liburnian immigration. Trade with the Greeks was more meagre, except in the Hellenistic age. Just as in other parts of the Mediterranean, large quantities of North African coins are prominent. Celtic influence is important, especially in jewellery and tools, but mostly it is not direct.≈†. Batoviƒá, Liburnska kultura, Matica Hrvatska i Arheolo≈°ki muzej Zadar, Zadar, 2005, UDK: 904 (398 Liburnija), Seafarers The Liburnians were renowned seafarers, notorious for their raids in the Adriatic Sea, which they conducted in their swift galleys. The Romans knew them principally as a people addicted to piracy. The major harbour of the Liburnian navy since the 5th century BC was Corynthia at the eastern cape of Krk island, including 7 unearthed docks, a marine arsenal, and stony fortifications; this early harbour persisted in its function through ancient and medieval times to the 16th century. The Liburnians constructed different ship types; their galaia was an early prototype of transport galleys, lembus was a fishing shipHans Krahe, Die Sprache der Illyrier, I. Teil, Wiesbaden, 1955, p. 114.H. Krahe, Griech. ŒªŒ≠ŒºŒ≤ŒøœÇ, lat. lembus - eine illyrische Schiffsbezeichnung?, Gymnasium, 59/1952, H. 1, p. 79.L.

Remains of a 10 meter long ship from the 1st century BC were found in Zaton near Nin (Aenona in Liburnia proper), the ship keel with the bottom planking made of 6 rows of wooden boards on each side, joined together and sewn with resin cords and wooden wedges, testifying to the Liburnian shipbuilding tradition style known as \\"Serilia Liburnica\\". Deciduous trees (oak and beech) were used, while some climber was used for the cords.Z. Brusiƒá, Istra≈æivanje antiƒçke luke kod Nina, Diadora 4, 1968, pages 206-209 A 10th-century AD ship of identical form and size, made with wooden fittings instead of sewn planking joints, was found in the same place, \\"Condura Croatica\\" used by the Medieval Croats. Condura could be the closest known vessel to the original \\"liburna\\" galley in form, only much smaller, with the features of a quick and agile galley, having a shallow bottom, very straightened but long, with one large Latin sail and a row of oars on each side. =Liburna= Battle between Liburnian and Picenian ships from the Novilara tablets (6th/5th century BC) The best known Liburnian ship was their oar-propelled warship, known as a libyrnis (ŒªŒπŒ≤œçœÅŒΩŒπœÇ, ŒªŒπŒ≤œÖœÅŒΩŒØœÇ) to the Greeks and a liburna to the Romans. Liburnae may have been shown in a naval battle scene carved on a stone tablet (Stele di Novilara) found near Antique Pisaurum (Pesaro) and dated to the 5th or 6th century BC. It depicts a legendary battle between the Liburnian and Picenian fleets. The liburna was presented as a light ship with one row of oars, one mast, one sail and a prow twisted outwards. Under the prow was a rostrum made for striking enemy ships under the sea. In its original form, the liburna was similar to the Greek penteconter. It had one bench with 25 oars on each side. Later, in the time of the Roman Republic, it became a smaller version of a trireme, but with two banks of oars (a bireme), faster, lighter, and more agile than biremes and triremes. The liburnian design was adopted by the Romans and became a key part of the Roman Navy, possibly by way of the Macedonian navy, in the 2nd half of the 1st century BC. Liburnae ships played a crucial role in the naval battle of Actium in Greece, which lasted from August 31 to September 2 of 31 BC. Because of the liburna's maneuverability and the bravery of its Liburnian crews, these ships completely defeated much bigger and heavier eastern ships, quadriremes and penterames. The liburna was different from the battle triremes, quadriremes and quinqueremes -- not in terms of rowing, but rather in its specific construction.C.G. Starr Jr., The Roman Imperial Navy 31 B.C. ‚Äì A.D. 324, West- port, Connecticut 1975, page 54M. Zaninoviƒá, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43-67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) ¬ª65¬´, pages 46, 47 It was long and wide with a draft. Two rows of oarsmen pulled 18 oars per side. The ship could make up to 14 knots under sail and more than 7 under oars. Such a vessel, used as a merchantman, might take on a passenger, as Lycinus relates in the 2nd-century dialogue, traditionally attributed to Lucian of Samosata: \\"I had a speedy vessel readied, the kind of bireme used above all by the Liburnians of the Ionian Gulf.\\" Bireme Roman warships, probably liburnians, of the Danube fleet during Trajan's Dacian Wars. Once the Romans had adopted the liburna, they improved it. The benefits gained from the addition of rams and protection from missiles more than made up for the slight loss of speed.Morrison, J. S., and J. F. Coates. 1996. Greek and Roman Warships 399-30 B.C. Oxford.pgs 170, 317. The ships also required that the regular Roman military unit be simplified in order to function more smoothly. Each ship operated as an individual entity, so the more complicated organization normally used was not necessary.C. G. Starr, The Roman Imperial Navy 31 BC-AD 324, 3rd ed., Chicago, 1993, p. 59. Within the navy, there were probably liburnae of several varying sizes, all put to specific tasks such as scouting and patrolling Roman waters against piracy.J. S. Morrison and J. F. Coates, Greek and Roman Warships 399-30 B.C., Oxford, 1996, p. 317. The Romans made use of liburnae particularly in some provinces where they formed the bulk of the fleets,L. Casson, Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World, Princeton, 1971, p. 141.C. G. Starr, The Roman Imperial Navy 31 BC-AD 324, 3rd ed., Chicago, 1993, p. 54.J. S. Morrison and J. F. Coates, Greek and Roman Warships 399-30 B.C., Oxford, 1996, p. 171. while they were included in smaller numbers in the fleets at Ravenna and Micenum where a large number of Illyrians were serving, especially Dalmatae, Liburnians and Pannonians. Gradually liburna became a generic name for different types of Roman ships, attached also to cargo ships in later Antiquity. Tacitus and Suetonius were using it as a synonym for battle ship. In inscriptions it was mentioned as the last class of battle ships: hexeres, penteres, quadrieres, trieres, liburna.M. Zaninoviƒá, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43-67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) ¬ª65¬´, page 46 In Medieval sources, \\"liburna\\" ships were often recorded in use by Croatian and Dalmatian pirates and sailors, probably not always referring to ships of the same form. Language The Liburnian language is an extinct language which was spoken by the ancient Liburnians, who occupied Liburnia in classical times. Classification of the Liburnian language is not clearly established; it is reckoned as an Indo-European language with a significant proportion of the Pre-Indo-European elements from the wider area of the ancient Mediterranean. Extinction of the language and ethnicity In AD 634 Eastern Roman emperor Heraclius invited the Chrovates or Chrobati (ancestors of the Croats), who lived on the north side of the Carpathians, in what is now southern Poland (or Galicia), to occupy the province as vassals of the Empire.Constantine Porphyrogenitos, De Administrando Imperio, ch. 31. Their presence had a permanent effect on the Romanized culture, and the Liburnians faded as a distinct ethnic group.

In the traditional view, this lasted until 1387, however, many modern scholars view this rule as lasting only three generations, ending with Harald Greycloak in the late 10th century. The moniker \\"Fairhair dynasty\\" is a retrospective construction: in their lifetime what little traces there are refer to them consistently as \\"Ynglings\\". Dynasty itself: traditional view vs artificial construct Kingdom of Norway (red) in 1020, with the territory of Finnmark The Fairhair Dynasty is traditionally regarded as the first royal dynasty of the united kingdom of Norway. It was founded by Harald I of Norway, known as Haraldr hinn h√°rfagri (Harald Fairhair or Finehair), the first King of Norway (as opposed to \\"in Norway\\"), who defeated the last resisting petty kings at the Battle of Hafrsfjord in 872. According to the traditional view, after Harald Fairhair first unified the kingdom, Norway was inherited by his agnatic (male) descendants. In the 13th century, this was codified in law. Unlike other Scandinavian monarchies and Anglo-Saxon England, Norway was never an elective monarchy. However, in the first centuries after Harald Fairhair, there were several periods during which the country was effectively ruled not by a king but by one of the Jarls of Lade, (Old Norse Hla√∞ir), from the northern part of Norway. The first such period was from about 975 to about 995 under Haakon Sigurdsson (H√°kon Sigur√∞arson, often called 'Jarl Haakon'). Also, although Harald Fairhair's kingdom was the kernel of a unified Norway, it was still small and his power centre was in Vestfold, in the south. And when he died, the kingdom was divided between his sons. Some historians put emphasis on the actual monarchical control over the country and assert that Olaf II (Olaf the Stout, who later became St. Olaf), who reigned from 1015, was the first king to have control over the entire country. He is generally held to be the driving force behind Norway's final conversion to Christianity and was later revered as Rex Perpetuum Norvegi√¶ (Latin: eternal king of Norway).Arno Borst, Medieval Worlds : Barbarians, Heretics, and Artists in the Middle Ages, University of Chicago, 1992, , p. 132.The phrase is first recorded in the contemporary Historia Norwegi√¶ - Knut Helle, The Cambridge History of Scandinavia Volume 1, Prehistory to 1520, Cambridge University Press, 2003, , p. 379. Some provinces did not actually come under the rule of the Fairhair kings before the time of Harald III (Harald Hardrada, r. 1046-1066). Either of these may therefore be regarded as further unifiers of Norway. And some of the rulers were nominally or actually vassals of the King of Denmark, including Jarl Haakon. It is undisputed that later kings, until Magnus IV (Magnus the Blind, r. 1130-1135 and 1137-1139), were descended from Harald Hardrada: the 'Hardrada dynasty'. However, many modern historians doubt whether Harald III or his predecessors Olaf Tryggvason, Olaf II and Magnus the Good were in fact descended from Harald Fairhair (for example questioning the identification of Halfdan in Hadafylke with the father of Sigurd SyrM. Sj√∂str√∂m, \\"Scandinavian medieval descendants of Charlemagne: A detailed genealogy of the issue of Agnes Haakonsdottir, of the so-called Fairhair dynasty\\", Foundations - Journal of the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy vol 2 (2007:4, July), pp. 253-276: \\"It is very likely that the lord Halvdan, father of kinglet Sigurd Syr, was not identical with a possible Halvdan in Hadafylke, grandson of king Harald\\". or Harald Fairhair's fathering of Sigurd Hrise on a Sami girl called Sn√¶fridHelle, p. 191.) and whether they in fact made such a claim, or whether these lineages are a construction from the 12th century. Sverre Sigurdsson's claim to be the son of Sigurd Munn is also usually considered to be dubious, which would make Inge II (Inge B√•rdsson) possibly the last king of a dynasty. Kingdom of Norway at its greatest extent, around 1265 Scholars now consider the Fairhair dynasty at least partly the product of medieval invention.Helle, p. 185.Birgit and Peter Sawyer, Medieval Scandinavia: from Conversion to Reformation, circa 800-1500, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993, , p. 61. One motive would be to increase the legitimacy of rulers by giving them a clear royal ancestry dating back to the foundation of the kingdom. Another was to provide pedigrees for other people by connecting them to the royal house. Versions of the royal descent are preserved in various works by Icelandic skalds and historians, some based on now lost works: √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir's Ynglingatal, in N√≥regs konungatal (which preserves information from a lost work by S√¶mundr fr√≥√∞i), and at greatest length in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla (which preserves information from a now lost version of Ari √ûorgilsson's √çslendingab√≥k). These differ in some respects. Joan Turville- Petre explored the relationship between them and argued that the original aims were to establish a framework of regnal years for dating and to connect Icelandic chieftains to them,Joan Turville-Petre, \\"The Genealogist and History: Ari to Snorri\\", Saga-Book 20 (1978-81), pp. 7-23 (pdf), especially pp. 8, 10: \\"The numbers suggest that this was a professional genealogical document, made up in sets of ten generations\\". and that the Vestfold origin of the dynasty was deliberately altered and they were connected to the Swedish Ynglings rather than the Skj«´ldungs to fit Icelandic tradition.Turville-Petre, pp. 14: \\"According to Ynglingatal, the first five members were all buried in Vestfold; which implies that this was the centre of their power. Yet Ari entitles the first member Upplendingakonungr. In Icelandic historical tradition the emphasis is on the mountain regions\\"; 15: \\"The Skj«´ldungs were not in question . . . ; the Ynglings of Sweden were chosen\\". Claus Krag argued that an important motive was to establish a hereditary claim to Viken, the region around Oslo, because the area had been paying taxes to the King of Denmark.Claus Krag, Ynglingatal og Ynglingasaga: en studie i historiske kilder, Oslo: Universitetsforlaget 1991, OCLC 256562288, pp. 231, 243 Turville-Petre speaks of a \\"decisive reconstruction of Harald [Hardrada]'s ancestry probably carried out by Icelanders, some two hundred years after his time\\" which made Halfdan the Black the progenitor of a dynasty which stretched in three branches from Harald Fairhair to Olaf Tryggvason, Olaf II and Harald.Turville-Petre, p. 15 \\\\- in fulfillment of prophetic dreams, according to Heimskringla, in which the genealogy reaches its full form. One particular point of doubt raised by historians is whether Harald III's father was actually descended in unbroken male line from a younger (and somewhat obscure) son of Harald Fairhair,Sj√∂str√∂m, for example, regards this as evidence of later invention: \\"[T]he male-line descent of Sigurd Syr from Harald Fairhair/Sch√∂nhaar is very uncertain, redolent of a later, possibly 12th- century, creation in support of the established royal Hardraada dynasty's legitimacy claims\\". and Olav II in another obscure but unbroken male line. It has been suggested that their claims to the throne were bolstered by genealogical invention because although they shared the same mother, √Östa Gudbrandsdatter, the mother's descent was unimportant in inheritance according to traditional Germanic law. In this critical view, only three generations of Fairhair kings reigned, from 930 to 1030, for 40 years altogether. The kings Olav Tryggvason and St. Olav, their family ties with the Fairhair dynasty perhaps a 12th-century invention, ruled for 18 years altogether and Harald Hardrada then founded a new dynasty. There may be as many as 6 dynasties altogether subsumed under the title of Fairhair dynasty: Harald Fairhair's, Olaf Tryggvason's, St. Olaf's, Harald Hardrada's, Magnus Erlingsson's and Sverre's. Genealogy The problem points (points of broken genealogy) in the medieval royal lineage in the so-called Fairhair dynasty are:Jo Rune Ugulen, \\"Kongar i dei norske √¶ttetavlene\\" (Kings in the Norwegian genealogies), Norsk Slektshistorisk Forening 1999/2000, reprinted from Genealogen 99.1, pp. 20-23 * whether either Olaf I of Norway or Olaf II of Norway descended from Harald I of Norway (Harald Fairhair) * whether Harald III of Norway descended from Harald I * whether Harald IV of Norway was son of King Magnus III of Norway * whether King Sverre was son of King Sigurd II of Norway, * whether Haakon IV of Norway was son of King Haakon III Each of them came from \\"nowhere\\" and won the kingdom, the three latter claiming to be hitherto unknown natural sons of an earlier king. Olaf I is given a male-line descent from Harald I in the Icelandic sagas, as grandson of Harald's alleged son Olaf in Vika. However, Viken and its region of Norway, Vestfold, were not parts of Harald I's dominions but subject to the Danish kings at the time, making this connection dubious. Further, the future king Olaf is said to have been born posthumously to a mother who had taken refuge in the Orkneys, yet the age assigned him in other sources would place his birth years after the date attributed to the death of his father. The Heimskringla then relates that he was enslaved in Estonia as a three-year old, only to tell his true parentage to the man who discovered him there and freed him six years later. Olaf II is likewise claimed to have been a male-line descendant of Harald I, as great-grandson of Harald I's alleged son Bj√∏rn in Vestfold, yet he is first known to history as a successful viking marauder rather than a landed prince. The reliability of these two claims depends on the credibility of the Icelandic accounts (in particular Heimskringla) and the sources used to compile them, and if deemed unreliable, their reigns would represent distinct dynasties from that of Fairhair. Harald III is historically attested to have referred only to his kinship with his maternal half-brother, Olaf II. Much later legends (sagas authored under the patronage of royal courts of Harald III's descendants) claim Harald III's father also to have descended from Harald I (through Harald Fairhair's alleged son Sigurd Hrise). Thus, Harald III's 'Hardrada dynasty' is represented in the sagas as a branch of the Fairhair dynasty. They also became known as the 'St. Olaf dynasty' in honor of the founder's half-brother. Harald IV arrived in Norway from his native Ireland and claimed to be the natural son of Magnus III, sired during the latter's Irish expedition. His claim seems, from historical sources, to be based on tales told by his Irish mother and family circle during his youth. Were one to view these claims as dubious, then Harald IV instead gave rise to a new dynasty, the 'Gille' (Irish) or 'Gylle dynasty'. The most seriously discredited alleged scion, practically regarded as an impostor by many modern academics, was Sverre I, who arrived in Norway from his native Faroe Islands, took up leadership in the embattled and heirless Birkebeiner party of the civil war, and claimed to be the natural son of Sigurd II by Gunhild, Sverre's attested mother. Sverre was sired during his mother's marriage with another man, Unas the Combmaker. Only in adulthood, so the claim goes according to legends, did his mother tell Sverre his 'real' paternity. Based on historical sources, no one else appears to have given the story credence. During that stage of the civil war, the strife was so intense that genealogical truth had evolved to a relative concept. Many royal pretenders claimed to be sons of King Sigurd II, and that was mostly a political statement - their claims were at best dubious. It may have meant just that the claimant desired to continue the perceived policies of Sigurd and his party, and in that sense were his 'sons'. Sverre I would be viewed as starting the Sverre dynasty. Haakon IV was born to a Norwegian peasant girl after the death of King Haakon III. She and the late king's inner circle affirmed that she had been the king's lover and that the boy had been sired by him. Of all the last-mentioned four problematic points of descent, this appears, on the face of it, as the most trustworthy. Were this disputed, Haakon IV, would be regarded as having started yet another new dynasty, though he is generally regarded as having continued the 'Sverre dynasty'. =Kings and pretenders in sub-dynasties= Original Fairhair lineage: *Harald I of Norway Harald Fairhair (Harald H√•rfagre) : c. 890 ‚Äì c. 930 *Eric I of Norway Eric Bloodaxe (Eirik Blod√∏ks) : c. 930‚Äì934 *Haakon I of Norway Haakon the Good (H√•kon den Gode) : 934‚Äì961 *Harald II of Norway Harald Greyfur (Harald Gr√•fell): 961‚Äì976 Viken, perhaps unrelated 'Tryggvason' dynasty: *Olaf I of Norway Olaf Tryggvason : 995‚Äì1000 Vestfold, the start of the St. Olav dynasty: *Olaf II of Norway Olaf Haraldsson, Olav the Stout, St. Olav (Olav Digre / Sankt Olav / Olav den Hellige) : 1015‚Äì1028 *Magnus I of Norway Magnus the Good (Magnus den Gode) : 1035‚Äì1047 Hardrada dynasty: *Harald III of Norway Harald Hardrada (Harald Hardr√•de) : 1046‚Äì1066 *Magnus II of Norway Magnus Haraldsson : 1066‚Äì1069 *Olaf III of Norway Olaf the Peaceful (Olav Kyrre) : 1066‚Äì1093 *Haakon Magnusson (H√•kon Magnusson) : 1093‚Äì1094 *Magnus III of Norway Magnus Bareleg (Magnus Berrf√∏tt) : 1093‚Äì1103 *Olaf Magnusson : 1103‚Äì1115 *Eystein I of Norway (√òystein Magnusson) : 1103‚Äì1123 *Sigurd I of Norway Sigurd the Crusader (Sigurd Jorsalfare) : 1103‚Äì1130 *Magnus IV of Norway Magnus the Blind (Magnus Blinde): 1130‚Äì1135 **Sigurd Slembe Sigurd the Noisy : 1135‚Äì1139, rival king *Magnus V of Norway Magnus Erlingsson : 1161‚Äì1184 **Olav Ugj√¶va : 1166‚Äì1169, rival king **Sigurd Magnusson : 1193‚Äì1194, rival king **Inge Magnusson : 1196‚Äì1202, rival king **Erling Steinvegg Erling Stonewall : 1204‚Äì1207, rival king Gille dynasty: *Harald IV of Norway Harald Gille : 1130‚Äì1136 *Sigurd II of Norway Sigurd Munn : 1136‚Äì1155 *Eystein II of Norway (√òystein Haraldsson) : 1142‚Äì1157 *Inge I of Norway Inge the Hunchback (Inge Krokrygg) : 1136‚Äì1161 *Haakon II of Norway Haakon Broadshoulder (H√•kon Herdebreid) : 1157‚Äì1162 **Sigurd Markusfostre : 1162‚Äì1163, rival king **Eystein Meyla Eystein the Maiden (√òystein M√∏yla) : 1174‚Äì1177, rival king **Jon Kuvlung : 1185‚Äì1188, rival king *Inge II of Norway (Inge B√•rdsson) : 1204‚Äì1217 Philip Simonsson and Skule Baardsson cannot be easily placed into the Fairhair dynasty scheme.

A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the corolla, such as that of a ray floret in plants in the daisy family Asteraceae. Poaceae and Cyperaceae right The ligule is part of the leaf that is found at the junction of the blade and sheath of the leaf. It may take several forms, but it is commonly some form of translucent membrane or a fringe of hairs. The membranous ligule can be very short 1-2 mm (Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis) to very long 10-20 mm (Johnson grass, Sorghum halepense), it can also be smooth on the edge or very ragged. Some grasses do not have a ligule, for example barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli). A ligule can also be defined as a membrane-like tissue or row of delicate hairs typically found in grasses at the junction of the leaf sheath and blade. The ligule appears to be a continuation of the leaf sheath and encircles or clasps the stem as does the leaf sheath. The three basic types of ligules are: membranous, a fringe of hairs (ciliate), and absent or lacking. Most grasses have ligules, and the shape, length, and appearance of the ligule margin provide consistent characters for separating genera and some species of grasses.

It was developed by Steve Jackson and Philip Reed, and illustrated by Alex Fernandez. Gameplay The game comes with three decks of cards: \\"Weapons\\", \\"Gadgets\\" and \\"Special\\". \\"Weapons\\" and \\"Gadgets\\" are cards that can be picked up by landing on power up spaces on the board, while \\"Special\\" cards can only be obtained by \\"fragging\\" (killing) a player. To start the game, each player creates a character by allocating a total of seven points to three attributes: health, speed and accuracy. Health points affect resistance to damage, speed points affect the amount of movement per turn and accuracy points affect \\"to hit\\" rolls. A very high accuracy can allow a character to fire two or even three times per turn. At the start of each turn, the player rolls dice to determine maximum movement spaces. As players move, they can land on a variety of spaces (trap, acid, water, power up, etc.). Players may also attempt to shoot other players. The less distance to the target, the greater the chance to hit. If a to hit roll is successful, the defender rolls health dice and the attacker rolls damage. If the target is reduced to zero health, the attacker scores one \\"frag\\" and the target player respawns on his/her next turn. The game can have several objectives, including: *Score - Being the first player to score a specified number of \\"frags\\". *Survival - Being the last person still in the game. *\\"Guardian\\" mode - Killing a certain character, with other members attempting to provide protection. *Capture the flag - One team capturing the opposing team's flag a certain number of times. The original version is out of print. The new version, Frag Gold Edition, released in 2009, includes upgraded components: a two-sided solid gameboard, plastic figures, erasable character cards, and 18 dice. Expansions and Spinoffs Several expansions and spinoffs to the original Frag game have been made: *Frag: Death Match, the first expansion, released in October 2001, adds rules for team play and new board features like barrels, color-coded doors and water. It includes an extra board. *Frag: Fire Zone, the second expansion, adds lava, rocket jumps, knockback effects from weapons and jump pads. It includes two extra boards. *Frag PvP, technically the third expansion (as it needs base Frag to play), merges Frag with Scott Kurtz's hit comic PvP. *Frag Deadlands merges Frag with the GURPS Deadlands campaign setting. This is a boxed edition making it a stand alone game. It also adds a new card type - \\"Hex.\\" *Dork Frag, only available in Dork Tower Issue #25 and in the Dork Tower board game, merges Frag with the characters from John Kovalic's hit comic Dork Tower into a truncated stand-alone edition. =Fan Material= A large amount of fan-created material, including new weapons and maps, can be found on the official Frag website.

It is located 63 km north of Sisophon and about 20 km east of the Thai border. The commune of Banteay Chhmar contains 14 villages. The massive temple of Banteay Chhmar, along with its satellite shrines and reservoir (baray), comprises one of the most important and least understood archaeological complexes from Cambodia's Angkor period. History A prince battles a demon (north section of west gallery, third enclosure wall) Like Angkor Thom, the temple of Banteay Chhmar was accomplished during the reign of Jayavarman VII in the late 12th or early 13th century. One of the temple's shrines once held an image of Srindrakumararajaputra (the crown prince), a son of Jayavarman VII who died before him.Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, The temple doors record Yasovarman I's failed invasion of Champa.Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., The long Old Khmer inscription found at the site (K.227), and now on display in the National Museum, Phnom Penh, relates how Prince Srindrakumara was protected on two occasions by four companions in arms, once against Rahu, and once on a military campaign against Champa. Their four statues, with one of the prince, was placed in the central chapel. Another bas-relief states Yasovarman II was attacked by Rahu, but \\"saved by a young prince.\\" The site The complex resembles Angkor Thom and other structures attributed to Jayavarman VII. It is one of two sites outside Angkor with the enigmatic face- towers. Besides that, its outer gallery is carved with bas-reliefs depicting military engagements and daily life scenes very similar to the well-known ones in Bayon. The complex is oriented to the east, where there's a dried baray (about 1.6 by 0.8 km), which had a temple on an artificial island (mebon) in its centre. There are three enclosures, as typical. The external one, largely ruined, was 1.9 by 1.7 km and surrounded by a moat. The middle enclosure, provided with a moat too, is 850 by 800 m. It contains the main temple, surrounded by a gallery with reliefs 250 by 200 m which constitutes the third inner enclosure.Banteay Chhmar on CISARK site Besides the main temple and the mebon there are other eight secondary temples. Four stelae detailing Jayavarman VII's genealogy were placed (though they remain unfinished) at each of the four corners of the third enclosure wall, mirroring the stelae that occupied the four corner-shrines (Prasat Chrung) of the king's capital at Angkor Thom. Modern threats Because of its remote location and its proximity to the Thai border, the complex has been subjected to severe looting, especially in the 1990s.Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., In 1998, 2000 and 2002 the temple was listed by the World Monuments Fund as one of the top one hundred most endangered sites in the world.World Monuments Watch 1996-2008 For example, in 1998 a group of soldiers stole a 30-metre section of the southern wall. The bas-reliefs of Banteay Chhmar once displayed eight exceptional Avalokite≈õvaras in the west gallery, but now only two remain. In January 1999 looters dismantled sections of the western gallery wall containing these bas-reliefs. They were intercepted by Thai police and 117 sandstone pieces of the wall were recovered. They are now on display in the National Museum of Cambodia in Phnom Penh.

She is considered to be one of the world's finest viola da gamba players, specializing in solo and ensemble music of the 17th and 18th centuries. She has a particular interest in French Baroque repertoire for seven-string bass viola da gamba. She also performs Spanish, Italian, German, and modern repertoire for the instrument and has released many CDs. Her long-time performing partner is Lee Santana, who plays the lute, theorbo, chitarrone, and baroque guitar. In addition to an original 18th-century gamba made by Matthais Alban in Tyrol, 1687, she plays a seven-string Tielke replica made by Ingo Muthesius and a six-string Italian gamba made by Claus Derenbach. Her main instrument, the Alban gamba, was discovered in 1952 in an Austrian convent, and was restored by Ingo Muthesius. Muthesius replaced the neck, while retaining the original lion's head scroll and peg box. Claus Derenbach has made a new bridge and fingerboard. The body remains original. Unusually, no sister instrument has been found to date, though the top-wood corresponds with violins surviving from Alban's workshop in Bozen, where he worked with his two sons until 1712. The instrument was bequeathed to Perl in the previous owner's will.Paraphrased from the liner notes to the 2019 recording of the J.S. Bach flute sonatas, written by Perl.

It was co-created by Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry, along with Tropic editors Gene Weingarten and Tom Shroder. The Tropic Hunt debuted in 1984, and as of 2018 there have been a total of 18 Hunts (plus one played- from-home 'non-hunt'). The winners of the 2011 Herald Hunt were Jeffrey Kobal, Cheryl Kobal, and Adam Horowitz.  Early history and name change  The hunt got its name from the Sunday magazine supplement to the Miami Herald called Tropic, in which Dave Barry had a regular column. For the Hunt, the magazine, and a large section of South Florida, were turned into a large scavenger hunt/puzzle, which has attracted thousands of people from all over the United States. The hunt in 1998 was the last Tropic Hunt, because the Miami Herald ceased publishing Tropic magazine shortly thereafter. The Miami Herald reinstated the hunt in 2001, now calling it the Herald Hunt. It creates a special magazine section each time for the Hunt.  Format  The first two years, the Hunt was a car-based chase around South Florida, In 1986, it changed to the still current design, where Hunters gathered in one walkable urban neighborhood. Hunts have been held in Downtown Miami, South Miami, Miami Beach, Coconut Grove, Coral Gables, and Hollywood. The Hunt consists of three parts. Answering the \\"opening questions\\" directs Hunters to five puzzle sites scattered through the Hunt area. Solving the five Hunt puzzles‚Äîthe answer is always a number‚Äîindicates the five authentic clues on a list of dozens of numbered bogus clues. Hunters have three hours to solve the puzzles, then at 3 p.m., a sixth and final clue is announced from the main stage. This begins the \\"endgame\\", which is by far the most difficult puzzle of the day. Solving the endgame often leads to a phone number, or directs Hunters to go to a certain out-of-the-way location and give a password to someone identified in a cryptic way. In 2007, Hunters who solved the endgame knew they needed to find a sandwich. Only when they arrived at a location marked on the Hunt Map with a sandwich, they saw a sign that said \\"Right idea. Wrong one.\\" In fact, they had to go to a location on the beach, marked with a witch. In other words, a \\"sand witch.\\" If they went to that spot on the beach, they saw a Hunt volunteer wearing a witch's hat and holding a broom. Post Hunt  Since the Hunt became the Herald Hunt in 2001, it has been designed by Barry and Shroder. In May 2008, the Washington Post Magazine held a Hunt in downtown Washington DC, attended by about 5,000 people, including dozens who came up from South Florida. The May 17, 2009, Post Hunt attracted an estimated 10,000 participants. For the first time in 10 years, Gene Weingarten, now a columnist for the Post Magazine, joined Shroder, now editor of the Post Magazine, and Barry in designing the Hunt. The winners of the 2010 Post Hunt were John Sanders, Joe Grossman, Chris Wong, Eric Pilar, Katie Elder, Eana Chung, and Suzanne Schwartz.\\"For Post Hunt players, more wild mind trips\\" Washington Post, June 7, 2010. p.

Before their nursery rhyme inspired song, \\"Little Star\\", became a number one hit, the band usually performed informally under the boardwalk by their homes. \\"Little Star\\" was the only million seller for the group, and was written by Venosa and Picone. It spent 19 weeks in the Billboard Hot 100, earning gold disc status. The song reached number 25 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1958. After their success with \\"Little Star\\", the band, still in their teens, toured with artists such as Buddy Holly, Dion and the Belmonts, Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. However, none of their subsequent singles reached the charts at all making them a prime example of one-hit wonders. In early 1970s, lead singer Picone returned to the group replacing Tardogno as the lead singer. That group comprising Vito Picone, Freddie Redmond, Nino Amato and Bruce Copp have been together ever since and to this date, have not stopped touring. They can be seen annually performing at the San Gennaro Festival, in Little Italy, Manhattan, New York City. According to the Elegants website, Freddie Redmond died of emphysema in 2006, and was replaced by original member, James Moschella. As of 2012, the Elegants are still performing at concerts and events throughout the United States, under the name \\"Vito Picone & The Elegants\\". They still perform \\"Little Star\\", as well as their interpretations of many golden oldies. The Elegants band members include Joe Lucenti on lead guitar, Alex \\"Al Bal\\" Leonard and Mark Garni on keyboards, Mike Catalano and Pete Gamby on electric bass, Vinny Cognato and Sal Albanese on drums. Moschella performed with The Charts in the 1980s. Carmen Romano (born on August 17, 1938) died on August 2, 2016, at the age of 77. Original member, Artie Venosa died on April 20, 2018.

Add to the mix that they're both a couple of flab cakes, and there you have it‚Ä¶an ill considered adventure to circumnavigate Australia on a tandem.\\" In 2007/2008, Vic hosted and produced a weekly show titled 'Oddball' on 'Bondi Fm'. This was a 2-hour show, playing rarities from all genres. She then as part of the Wwoof (Willing Workers on Organic Farms) programme, worked at the Flying Fox Backpackers ‚Äì managing it for short time ‚Äì in Katoomba, New South Wales, Australia.

Starring Zbigniew Cybulski and Ewa Krzy≈ºewska, it completed Wajda's war films trilogy, following A Generation (1954) and Kanal (1956). The action of Ashes and Diamonds takes place in 1945, shortly after World War II. The main protagonist of the film, former Home Army soldier Maciek Che≈Çmicki, is acting in the anti-Communist underground. Maciek receives an order to kill Szczuka, the local secretary of the Polish Workers' Party. Over time, Che≈Çmicki increasingly doubts if his task is worth doing. Ashes and Diamonds, although based on the novel that directly supported the postwar Communist system in Poland, was subtly modified in comparison with the source material. Wajda sympathized with the soldiers of the Polish independence underground; thus, he devoted most of the attention to Che≈Çmicki. During the three-month development of Ashes and Diamonds, the director made drastic changes to the baseline scenario, thanks to his assistant director Janusz Morgenstern, as well as Cybulski, who played the leading role. The film received permission from the authorities to be distributed only through Andrzejewski's intercession. The film did not receive permission to be screened at the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival. However, Ashes and Diamonds appeared at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI award. At first, Ashes and Diamonds met positive critical reception, both in Poland and worldwide. However, after the Revolutions of 1989, it was criticized for falsifying the collective memory of Polish partisans. Nevertheless, the film maintained the reputation of one of the more famous Polish motion pictures in history.  Plot  On 8 May 1945, at the end of World War II, near a small country church, former Home Army soldiers, Maciek, Andrzej and Drewnowski, prepare to assassinate Konrad Szczuka, a political opponent and a secretary of Polish Workers' Party. The ambush fails as the attackers realize that they have mistakenly killed two innocents. Andrzej and Maciek's superior, Major Waga, learns of the failed assassination attempt. Waga orders Andrzej and Maciek to perform the task for the second time. They come to the Hotel Monopol Restaurant, where a banquet in honour of the victorious war begins, but the combatants do not participate. While sitting in the bar, Maciek and Andrzej listen to the song \\"The Red Poppies of Monte Cassino\\" and reminisce over their fallen comrades. In honour of them, Maciek lights several glasses of rectified spirit on fire. Their hapless comrade Drewnowski gets drunk at the bar, where he discusses career prospects in postwar Poland with PieniƒÖ≈ºek, a representative of the democratic press. Afterwards, Maciek goes to his hotel room to check his gun. However, a barwoman Krystyna, with whom Maciek had made a flirtatious conversation, enters the room. Both young people realize they fell in love, then go for a walk. It begins to rain, so Krystyna and Maciek decide to find shelter in a ruined church. Krystyna notices a poem inscribed on the wall, and Maciek recites it in a somber tone. Both lovers soon part, then Maciek returns to the bar where he discusses with Andrzej the sense of their duty. Meanwhile, completely drunk Drewnowski spoils the banquet, covering the other guests with foam from a fire extinguisher, and leaves the ball in shame, his hoped-for career as a Communist functionary in ruins. After the reception, Szczuka learns that his son Marek, who has joined the underground, is in custody. Maciek seeing Szczuka leave the hotel to meet his captured son, follows him and shoots him to death. The next morning, Maciek plans to leave Ostrowiec by train. However, he comes upon Andrzej beating Drewnowski for his newfound, opportunistic support for the underground. When Drewnowski calls Maciek's name, the assassin flees in fear. He accidentally runs into some soldiers of the Polish People's Army and, panicking, draws his pistol. They shoot at and fatally wound him. Maciek dies in agony on a garbage dump.  Cast  * Zbigniew Cybulski as Maciek Che≈Çmicki * Ewa Krzy≈ºewska as Krystyna * Wac≈Çaw Zastrze≈ºy≈Ñski as Szczuka * Adam Pawlikowski as Andrzej * Bogumi≈Ç Kobiela as Drewnowski * Stanis≈Çaw Milski as PieniƒÖ≈ºek * Ignacy Machowski as Waga  Production  = Writing = Andrzej Wajda, the director of the film, in 1963 Ashes and Diamonds is loosely based on the novel by Jerzy Andrzejewski, published for the first time in 1948. The novel was a mandatory school set book in communist Poland and enjoyed respect among the contemporary authorities. The first directors who tried to adapt the book into a film were Erwin Axer and Antoni Bohdziewicz. In Axer's script, which adhered to the spirit of the original, the roles were supposed to be more like caricatures. Historian Tadeusz Lubelski retrospectively commented on Axer's script with the following words: \\"Communists are even more decent and busy, aristocrats and former Home Army members ‚Äì even more vile and reckless.\\" Bohdziewicz's script contained a similar propaganda message, depicting the command of the Polish resistance in a bad light. There, Major Waga blackmailed Maciek to kill Szczuka, threatening him with a war trial; in the end, Maciek decided to support Szczuka. However, none of these scripts were implemented, and policymakers considered Bohdziewicz's vision too \\"defensive.\\" Jan Rybkowski also planned to direct an Ashes and Diamonds adaptation, though he eventually decided to focus on a comedy titled Kapelusz pana Anatola (Mr. Anatol's Hat). Thus, he gave Andrzej Wajda an opportunity to launch a project. In November 1957, Wajda carried out a letter conversation with Andrzejewski, during which the future director suggested several changes to the initial version of the story. A thread which concerned the judge Antoni Kossecki was deleted so that the main plot focused on the confrontation between Maciek and Szczuka. Also, Wajda suggested that the story be condensed to only one day, with Maciek acting as the central hero. Wajda and Andrzejewski completed the screenplay in January 1958, giving it for scrutiny to the Commission for Screenplay Assessment. After long consideration, the Commission, whose members were Aleksander ≈öcibor-Rylski, Andrzej Braun, Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz, Tadeusz Konwicki and Andrzej Karpowski, decided to vote for the screenplay's acceptance. = Development = Having the screenplay accepted, Wajda prepared for the development of Ashes and Diamonds within the \\"KADR\\" Film Unit. At first, the director intended to shoot the film in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. However, he finally chose an atelier in Wroc≈Çaw, the decision made due to possible savings and to prevent the policymakers from intervening too much in the film development. On 3 February 1958, the acting Chief of Cinematography Jerzy Lewi≈Ñski decided to start the production of Ashes and Diamonds, without consulting the authorities. The contract for the commission guaranteed Wajda a salary of 69,000 Polish zloty, whereas Andrzejewski received 31,500 Polish zloty. The overall budget of Ashes and Diamonds is estimated at 6,070,000 Polish zloty. Wajda then began gathering the film crew. Stanis≈Çaw Adler became the producer, whereas Jerzy W√≥jcik took the cinematography, and Filip Nowak was commissioned to select music material for the film. It was decided that Ashes and Diamonds be first filmed in the atelier, then in the open air. The main scenography made in the atelier represented the Monopol Hotel restaurant. However, the film crew did also use authentic locations, such as the St. Barbara's Church in Wroc≈Çaw and a chapel near Trzebnica. The director experienced some issues with the selection of the future cast. However, he found support in the person of Janusz Morgenstern, his assistant director. Morgenstern, more familiar with the acting market, encouraged Wajda to put Zbigniew Cybulski in the role of Maciek, although the director considered the candidature of Tadeusz Janczar. Having come to the film set, Cybulski instantly refused to play in a partisan uniform suggested by costume designer Katarzyna Chodorowicz, and insisted on wearing his \\"fifties' style dark glasses, jacket and tight jeans.\\" Wac≈Çaw Zastrze≈ºy≈Ñski, a theatrical actor with barely any film experience, was cast as Szczuka. Adam Pawlikowski, a musicologist, took the role of Andrzej, whereas Cybulski's colleague Bogumi≈Ç Kobiela was cast as Drewnowski. = Filming = Photography for Ashes and Diamonds started in March 1958, and finished in June 1958, after 60 shooting days. The film was shot in 1:1.85 format, which had never been used before in Polish cinema. During filming, the crew made crucial changes in the scenario, which affected the future reception of the film. For example, Cybulski suggested that Szczuka should hold Maciek while dying; Wajda added scenes containing Christian iconography; and Morgenstern invented the most widely known scene, during which Maciek and Andrzej light up the glasses filled with the rectified spirit. The ending was changed, too; Wajda cut down the scene from the novel, during which some soldiers of Polish People's Army commented on Maciek's death with following words: \\"Hey, you, ... what made you run away?\\" The most troublesome task was to convince the communist authorities to display Ashes and Diamonds. Party intellectuals were dissatisfied with making Maciek Che≈Çmicki the main character of the film. It was then that Andrzejewski himself, who‚Äìwith the support of his fellow writers‚Äìconvinced PZPR activists that the ideological message of the film was correct; without the help of the author of the novel, Wajda's work would have never been released. The official screening took place on 7 July 1958, after which Ashes and Diamonds could be distributed in cinemas. Despite the protests of Aleksander Ford, who demanded that the authorities ban the film, its official premiere took place on 3 October 1958. Nevertheless, due to the still existing doubts about its message, Ashes and Diamonds were banned from taking part in the main competition of the Cannes Film Festival. Then Lewi≈Ñski sent Wajda's work to the Venice Film Festival, where‚Äìapart from the main competition‚Äìit won the award of the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI). Reception Ashes and Diamonds was an international success. According to Janina Falkowska, this is Wajda's most recognizable film, and‚Äìin the opinion of Marek Hendrykowski‚Äìthe most important achievement of the Polish Film School, which highlights the director's characteristic style, while dealing with the Second World War. Despite the condemnation of the film by some Communist critics, many supporters of independent Poland identified themselves with the role of Maciek. Cybulski has been compared to James Dean in his performance, which was complemented by the fact that with his appearance, Polish actor personified the contemporary generation of the 1950s. In total, around 1,722,000 spectators watched Ashes and Diamonds during the opening year. = Critical reception in Poland = Ashes and Diamonds, a poster by Tomasz W√≥jcik, 2017 Polish film critics generally were delighted with the film adaptation of Andrzejewski's novel. Stanis≈Çaw Grzelecki assessed Ashes and Diamonds as \\"a new, outstanding work of Polish film art.\\" According to Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz, \\"Ashes and Diamonds is not a brilliant film, but it is certainly a great film\\". Jerzy P≈Ça≈ºewski enthusiastically commented on Wajda's work: \\"[...] we have a new, excellent Polish film. It's called Ashes and Diamonds.\\" Several other Polish film and literary critics‚ÄìStanis≈Çaw Grochowiak, Stanis≈Çaw Lem, Andrzej Wr√≥blewski‚Äìalso considered Ashes and Diamonds an exceptional work. In the foreground, due to the then-prevailing Communist system, among the issues discussed by critics were attempts at ideological interpretation. The tragic actions of Home Army soldiers, who supposedly unjustly continued their struggle against the new political reality, were pointed out at that time. These voices, however, included Jan J√≥zef Szczepa≈Ñski's opinion, which was devoid of ideological tone. In his opinion, Wajda showed the viewer the qualities of Polish young people during the war. Simultaneously, critics connected with the authorities had doubts about whether the director would not glorify this generation, which would induce the audience's solidarity with the \\"reactionary\\" soldier. Zygmunt Ka≈Çu≈ºy≈Ñski and Wiktor Woroszylski had the greatest complaints about Ashes and Diamonds. Ka≈Çu≈ºy≈Ñski sought an anachronism in the portrait of Maciek's persona, considering its styling more appropriate for contemporary times than for 1945. In turn, according to Woroszylski, \\"the Home Army soldiers have been endowed with such a clear sense of the absurdity of their misdeeds that [...] hands are falling.\\" Marxist reviewers criticized Ashes and Diamonds, highlighting its alleged lack of educational functions and the marginalization of Szczuka, who was depicted in the film as a mediocre party activist. Stanis≈Çaw Grochowiak, who found in Wajda's drama the \\"eschatological dimension\\" of the classical tragedy, rejected such propagandist interpretations. Critics looking for aesthetic issues in Wajda's work have interpreted it in a different way. Jerzy Kwiatkowski noted the high expression of adaptation in comparison with the original. Alicja Helman, in turn, put forward the opinion that \\"there is everything in this film‚Äìtoo much, too good, too beautiful\\", but at the same time it emphasizes \\"zeal, anxiety, takeover, great emotional passion\\". Ernest Bryll devoted a broader analysis to the evaluation of the antique structure of film work, with an inseparable fate showing the tragedy of the main character's actions. The role of Zbigniew Cybulski, as well as the musical arrangement and the cinematography of Jerzy W√≥jcik, were widely accepted. After the Revolutions of 1989, Ashes and Diamonds faced the accusations of falsifying history. Wajda was supposed to falsify the reality because, in his film, the underground soldiers chased Communists, even though the reality was the opposite. Andrzej Werner accused the film of a historical lie, while film critic Waldemar Cho≈Çodowski criticized Wajda's work for suggesting that the representatives of the underground should be isolated from society. Krzysztof KƒÖkolewski deplored the fact that Wajda's Ashes and Diamonds for Polish and international audiences were for years a source of knowledge about the times after the Second World War. However, he also noted that the director‚Äìin contrast to the author of the original‚Äìtoned down the propagandist message of the book, in which the underground soldiers were directly depicted as bandits. Conversely, Tadeusz Lubelski stated that Wajda's version warms the image of the underground to a much greater extent than the ones proposed by Axer and Bohdziewicz. Unlike KƒÖkolewski, Lubelski was convinced that the moment of the Polish October was perfectly captured during the shooting of the film. = Critical reception outside Poland = In Western Europe, Ashes and Diamonds was widely praised by film critics. The Italian critic Nevio Corich found in the film a lyrical reference to Baroque art. Some film experts, such as Fouma Saisho, pointed to the poetic qualities of the work. Georges Sadoul compared Wajda's work to those of the prominent director Erich von Stroheim. In his 1999 retrospective review for The Guardian, Derek Malcolm compared Maciek's death to the ending of Luis Bunuel's Los Olvidados. However, some critics were irritated by the alleged mannerism of the work and the exposition of Baroque ornamentation. Dave Kehr from Chicago Reader shared an opinion that \\"[f]ollowing the art cinema technique of the time, Wajda tends toward harsh and overstated imagery,\\" while the Time Out London review stated that \\"Wajda's way is the sweet smell of excess, but some scenes remain powerfully memorable ‚Äì the lighting of drinks on the bar, the upturned Christ in a bombed church, and Cybulski's prolonged death agonies at the close.\\" As David Parkinson from Empire said, \\"[Wajda's] final installment of the classic Polish trilogy is heavy in symbolism but remains affective and intimate viewing.\\" = Awards and nominations = Ashes and Diamonds received the FIPRESCI Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1959. The film was also nominated twice for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award, with Zbigniew Cybulski nominated in the \\"Best Actor\\" category and Andrzej Wajda nominated in the \\"Best Film from any Source\\". Legacy Ashes and Diamonds is considered by film critics to be one of the great masterpieces of Polish cinema and arguably the finest film of Polish realist cinema. Richard Pe√±a in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die considers the ending of the film to be one of the most powerful and often quoted endings in film history. The film was ranked #38 in Empire magazines \\"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\\" in 2010. In the 2015 poll conducted by Polish Museum of Cinematography in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Ashes and Diamonds was ranked as the third greatest Polish film of all time. Directors Martin Scorsese, Hayao Miyazaki, and Francis Ford Coppola have listed it as one of their favourite films of all time. Ashes and Diamonds had a significant impact on the development of the Polish Film School, causing a polemical reaction from other directors of the movement. In 1960, one of its members, Kazimierz Kutz, directed a polemical film entitled Nobody Cries (Nikt nie wo≈Ça, 1960). Unlike Maciek Che≈Çmicki, the protagonist of this film‚Äìalso a soldier of the independence underground‚Äìdoes not carry out the order, but tries to start life anew and settle in the Recovered Territories. In How to Be Loved (1961), Wojciech Jerzy Has made a pastiche of an iconic \\"scene with lamps\\". Here, Cybulski's character is not a conspirator ready to act, but an unshaven, drunken mythomaniac recalling his alleged heroic deeds. The myth of Cybulski also resounded in Wajda's later films. In his works Landscape After the Battle (1969) and The Wedding (1972), there is a renewed reference to the final dance. Under the influence of criticism from conservative reviewers, the director made The Crowned-Eagle Ring (Pier≈õcionek z or≈Çem w koronie, 1992). This work included self-plagiarism of the scene of lighting glasses in a bar (Cybulski was imitated by Tomasz Konieczny, while Rafa≈Ç Kr√≥likowski embodied Adam Pawlikowski), but the scene was set in a different, self-ironic context. However, while conservative circles regarded Wajda's The Crowned-Eagle Ring as a fair settlement of accounts with the past period, the film aroused embarrassment among liberal critics, with Jakub Majmurek writing about \\"the most painful aesthetic self-disgrace\\" on the part of the director. Former Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters claims that Ashes and Diamonds had \\"an enormous impact\\" on him as a young man, and the lyrics of the Pink Floyd song \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" from the band's 1983 album The Final Cut makes references to the film. After watching the film Ashes and Diamonds for several times at Oslo in 1960, theatre director Eugenio Barba decided to go to Poland for his further studies in directing. He enrolled his name at Warsaw University but could not complete his studies and did apprenticeship with Jerzy Grotowski. Barba had written a book on his experiences in Poland under the name Land of Ashes and Diamonds (1999).Barba, Eugenio. Land of Ashes and Diamonds: My Apprenticeship in Poland, Followed by 26 Letters from Jerzy Grotowski to Eugenio Barba, translated by Judy Barba and Eugenio Barba.

During World War II Japan used Bairoko Harbor to resupply its forces at Munda Point, an airstrip situated along the south coast of New Georgia. Allied forces deemed Munda critical for control of this section of the Solomon Islands and necessary for the continued progress northward toward Japan. After capturing Enogai, a village situated a few miles east of Bairoko Harbor, the Northern Landing Group of United States Marines comprising the 1st and 4th Marine Raider Battalions assaulted the harbor on June 20, 1943. Greatly outmanned, the lightly armed Marines failed to overcome the deeply entrenched, heavily armed Japanese defenders in the resulting Battle of Bairoko and were turned back after losses in dense jungle fighting. The loss marked the first time the Marine Raiders had failed to take an objective, and was blamed in part on failure of the United States Army Air Corps to provide air support for the operation as requested. The battle caused the Joint Chiefs to rethink the strategy of pitting lightly armed forces against well-fortified enemy forces, and the operation planners drew the criticism of the Joint Chiefs for having marginalized the entire operation \\"as if it had been a sideshow\\". Unable to prevent the loss of Munda to the Allies due to assaults on the airstrip by other forces, the Japanese evacuated the entire island of New Georgia via Bairoko Harbor within a month of the initial attack.

He kicked for Port Charlotte High School and played college football at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. While at Wisconsin, Hall played and won three bowl games (Rose, Hall of Fame and Copper Bowls). He signed as a rookie free agent to the New York Jets in 1997. During his time with the Jets, Hall established himself as one of the hardest hitting kickers in the NFL, once injuring a player on a kickoff tackle. Hall gave the Jets victory in The Monday Night Miracle in 2000 against the Dolphins with a 40-Yard field goal in overtime. Hall was troubled by a groin injury for the 2004 season and only appeared in eight games. Before being signed as a free agent by the Washington Redskins in 2003, he played six seasons for the New York Jets. His most accurate season came in 2005, when he converted 12 of 14 field goals for an 85.7% success rate, although his season long was only from 45 yards out. He also missed a crucial field goal, well within his range, in the Redskins' divisional playoff defeat against the Seattle Seahawks. Hall's 53-yard field goal with 59 seconds left in the final regular season game against Oakland clinched a 2001 playoff berth for the Jets. Hall missed the last second field goal attempt during the September 11, 2006 game vs. the Minnesota Vikings causing his team a loss. Hall's problems have stemmed from his constant string of injuries. He was placed on the injured reserve list for the 2006 season with a strained groin and a strained quadriceps muscle in his leg. The Redskins released Hall on March 7, 2007, and he subsequently retired.John Hall's Goal Post Grill & Sports Bar Hall is married to his wife Christina and they have three children (Brady, Ava, and Hanna).

Background Mills was born on November 18, 1826, in Enosburgh, Vermont. She was one of eight children of John Tolman and Elizabeth (Nichols) Tolman. Her family moved to Ware, Massachusetts by 1836, where her father and brothers expanded the family's tannery business. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College (then Mount Holyoke Female Seminary) in 1845. As a young woman, Mills taught at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary the first three years after she herself graduated, and was a teacher there during Emily Dickinson's year at the Seminary in 1847‚Äì1848. She continued to teach at the seminary until she married the missionary Cyrus Mills on September 11, 1848. In October of that year they departed to teach in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), on an assignment from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. They taught there for many years, until they returned to Boston in 1854. Mrs. Mills contracted amoebic dysentery during their tour abroad, and was in distinctly ill health by the time they returned to the United States. =Punahou School= In 1860 the couple traveled to Honolulu where Cyrus Mills became president of Oahu College (now known as Punahou School). Susan served as a teacher at the school, instructing in geography, geology, chemistry, and botany. They moved to California in 1864. =Mills College= Mills College was initially founded as the Young Ladies Seminary at Benicia in 1852. It was under the leadership of Mary Atkins, a graduate of Oberlin College. Susan and Cyrus Mills bought the grounds and organization from Atkins for $5000 in 1865. In 1866, Susan and Cyrus bought the Young Ladies Seminary and renamed it Mills Seminary. In 1871 the school was moved to Oakland, California and the school was incorporated in 1877. The school became Mills College in 1885. In 1890, after serving for decades as principal (under two presidents as well), Susan became the President of the college and held the position for 19 years. Death Mills retired in 1909 and died in Oakland, California, on December 12, 1912. Susan Tolman Mills is buried at Sunnyside Cemetery, located on the Mills College Campus.

A snowsquall, or snow squall, is a sudden moderately heavy snow fall with blowing snow and strong, gusty surface winds.National Weather Service Detroit/Pontiac It is often referred to as a whiteout and is similar to a blizzard but is localized in time or in location and snow accumulations may or may not be significant. Types There are two primary types of snowsqualls: lake effect and frontal. =Lake-effect snow= When arctic air moves over large expanses of warmer open waters in winter, convective clouds develop which cause heavy snow showers due to the large amount of moisture available. This occurs southwest of extratropical cyclones, with the curved cyclonic wind flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm Great Lakes which then leads to narrow lake-effect snow bands that can produce significant localized snowfall. Whiteout conditions will affect narrow corridors from shores to inland areas aligned along the prevailing wind direction. This will be enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by higher elevations. The name originates from the Great Lakes area of North America, however any body of water can produce them. Regions in lee of oceans, such as the Canadian Maritimes could experience such snowsqualls. The areas affected by lake-effect snow are called snowbelts and deposition rate of many inches (centimetres) of snow per hour are common in these situations. In order for lake-effect snow to form, the temperature difference between the water and 850 mbar should be at least 23 ¬∞F (-5 ¬∞C), surface temperature be around the freezing mark, the lake unfrozen, the path over the lake at least 100 km, and the directional wind shear with height should be less than 30¬∞ from the surface to 850 millibars. Extremely cold air over still warm water in early winter can even produce thundersnow, snow showers accompanied by lightning and thunder. =Frontal snowsquall= Frontal snowsquall moving toward Boston, Massachusetts, United States A frontal snowsquall is an intense frontal convective line (similar to a squall line), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front in situations where there are other contributing factors such as dynamic lifting from a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. This is similar to a line of thunderstorms in the summer but the tops of the clouds are only 5,000 to 10,000 feet (1,500 to 3,000 m), often difficult to see on radar. Forecasting these types of events is equivalent to summer severe weather forecast for squall lines: presence of a sharp frontal trough with wind shift and low level jet of more than 30 knots (55.58 km/h). However, the cold dome behind the trough is at 850 mbar instead of a higher level and must be at least -13 ¬∞F (-25 ¬∞C). The presence of surface moisture from bodies of water or preexisting liquid precipitation is also a significant contributing factor helping to raise the dew point temperature and saturate the boundary layer. This saturate can significantly increase the amount of convective available potential energy leading to deeper vertical growth and higher precipitable water levels increasing the volume of snow which can be produced by the squall. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow. Dangers Rapidly deteriorating weather conditions during snowsqualls often lead to traffic accidents. Winter conditions on Ontario Highway 401 in Toronto due to a snowsquall. Both types of snowsqualls are very dangerous for motorists and airplanes or generally any traveler unfortunate enough to get stuck in one. The change in conditions is very sudden, and slippery conditions and abrupt loss of visibility due to whiteouts often cause multiple-vehicle collisions. In the case of lake-effect snow, heavy amounts of snow can accumulate in short periods of time, possibly causing road closures and paralyzing cities. For instance, on January 9, 2015, a localized, heavy snow squall caused a 193 vehicle pile-up on I-94 highway near Galesburg, Michigan.

Depending on the application, considering or altering the passive dynamics of a powered system can have drastic effects on performance, particularly energy economy, stability, and task bandwidth. Devices using no power source are considered \\"passive\\", and their behavior is fully described by their passive dynamics. In some fields of robotics (legged robotics in particular), design and more relaxed control of passive dynamics has become a complementary (or even alternative) approach to joint-positioning control methods developed through the 20th century. Additionally, the passive dynamics of animals have been of interest to biomechanists and integrative biologists, as these dynamics often underlie biological motions and couple with neuromechanical control. Particularly relevant fields for investigating and engineering passive dynamics include legged locomotion and manipulation. History The term and its principles were developed by Tad McGeer in the late 1980s. While at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, McGeer showed that a human-like frame can walk itself down a slope without requiring muscles or motors. Unlike traditional robots, which expend energy by using motors to control every motion, McGeer's early passive-dynamic machines relied only on gravity and the natural swinging of their limbs to move forward down a slope. Models The original model for passive dynamics is based on human and animal leg motions. Completely actuated systems, such as the legs of the Honda Asimo robot, are not very efficient because each joint has a motor and control assembly. Human-like gaits are far more efficient because movement is sustained by the natural swing of the legs instead of motors placed at each joint. Passive dynamic walker simulation in Webots. Tad McGeer's 1990 paper \\"Passive Walking with Knees\\" provides an excellent overview on the advantages of knees for walking legs. He clearly demonstrates that knees have many practical advantages for walking systems. Knees, according to McGeer, solve the problem of feet colliding with the ground when the leg swings forward, and also offers more stability in some settings. Passive dynamics is a valuable addition to the field of controls because it approaches the control of a system as a combination of mechanical and electrical elements. While control methods have always been based on the mechanical actions (physics) of a system, passive dynamics utilizes the discovery of morphological computation. Morphological computation is the ability of the mechanical system to accomplish control functions. Applying passive dynamics Adding actuation to passive dynamic walkers result in highly efficient robotic walkers. Such walkers can be implemented at lower mass and use less energy because they walk effectively with only a couple of motors. This combination results in a superior \\"specific cost of transport\\". Energy efficiency in level-ground transport is quantified in terms of the dimensionless \\"specific cost of transport\\", which is the amount of energy required to carry a unit weight a unit distance. Passive dynamic walkers such as the Cornell Efficient Biped have the same specific cost of transport as humans, 0.20. Not incidentally, passive dynamic walkers have human-like gaits. By comparison, Honda's biped ASIMO, which does not utilize the passive dynamics of its own limbs, has a specific cost of transport of 3.23. and The current distance record for walking robots, 65.17 km, is held by the passive dynamics based Cornell Ranger. Passive dynamics have recently found a role in the design and control of prosthetics. Since passive dynamics provides the mathematical models of efficient motion, it is an appropriate avenue to develop efficient limbs that require less energy for amputees. Andrew Hansen, Steven Gard and others have done extensive research in developing better foot prosthetics by utilizing passive dynamics. Passive walking biped robots exhibit different kinds of chaotic behaviors e.g., bifurcation, intermittency and crisis.

It began in 1921, and enjoyed a reputation as one of New Zealand's leading theatre groups from the 1920s to the 1960s, with notable alumni including Dame Ngaio Marsh and Sam Neill. With the exception of some brief pauses, the club has continued to be the primary non-musical theatre society of the university, and remains active today, with a membership numbering from dozens to hundreds and typically staging at least two or three productions each year. History The Canterbury University College Drama Society began in 1921 under the leadership of Professor Sir James Shelley. It enjoyed a reputation as one of New Zealand's leading theatre groups from the 1920s to the 1960s. The Society was most notably active in the 1942‚Äì1969 era under Dame Ngaio Marsh, with critically acclaimed productions (especially of Shakespeare plays) and a 1949 theatre tour of Australia. The Society was wound up in the early 1990s due to financial difficulties but was resurrected by an ad hoc committee in October and November 1993, and restarted as a full student club in the beginning of 1994. In 2016 DramaSoc experienced a brief pause in events as club leadership faltered, before a new committee was formed at the 2016 AGM. The AGM was controversial, with the new committee consisting of 10 members, 7 of whom had never taken part in a DramaSoc event before that date. The AGM was attended by several prominent members of DramaSoc's sister club, the University Of Canterbury Musical Theatre Society (also known as MUSOC), and was subsequently described as MUSOC's 'hostile takeover' of DramaSoc by several DramaSoc members. Despite that incident, since then the club has experienced much growth and alongside its regular shows it has revived classic events such as 3SOME and A Day 2 Play, as well as started a regular improvisational theatre group, known as Say What? Premises and Performance Spaces The society's traditional home at the Ilam Campus was the Ngaio Marsh Theatre in the University of Canterbury Students' Association building. However, the society also regularly performed in other rooms of the Association building (most notably for its annual festival of student-authored one-act plays called 3SOME), in outdoor theatre settings on campus, the University Theatre in the Christchurch Arts Centre, and in roving street theatre events. However, with the Ngaio Marsh Theatre out of service following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, performances now primarily take place in the Jack Mann Auditorium on the College of Education campus.

Partners are either General Partners (GP) or Limited Partners (LP). One or more General Partners are responsible for managing the FLP and its assets. Limited Partners have an economic interest in the FLP, but typically lack two noteworthy rights: control and marketability. Limited Partners have no ability to control, direct, or otherwise influence the operations of the FLP. They can neither buy additional assets, nor sell existing assets, and they cannot act on the Partnership's behalf. They also substantially lack the ability to sell their interest, with one typical exception: transfers to immediate family members (spouse, siblings, and direct lineal descendants and ascendants). FLPs are partnerships limited to family members, hence the name. FLPs are typically holding companies, acting as an entity that holds the property (business interests, real estate investments, publicly traded or privately held securities) contributed by the members. FLPs have several benefits. They allow family members with aligned interests to pool resources, thus lowering legal, accounting, and investing costs. They allow one family member, typically the GP, to move assets to other family members (often children who are LPs), while still retaining control over the assets. Because the LPs have no rights of control, they cannot liquidate their partnership interest. The timing and amounts of distributions is the sole and exclusive prerogative of the GP. That is, a distribution cannot be made to one partner (GP or LP) unless all partners receive their pro rata portion of any disbursements. FLPs also allow for favorable tax treatment relating to the transfer of the assets, relating to the lack of control, and lack of marketability of LP interests discussed above. Taxes are paid on the fair market value of assets bought or given. Fair Market Value is the value that would be received (paid) to sell (buy) an asset between a hypothetical willing buyer and hypothetical willing seller, both acting in their own best interest and with reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts when neither is acting under compulsion. Consider the following scenario: A father wishes to transfer $1,000,000 to his son. If the father hands the son the amount in cash, the father will have to pay gift tax on the full amount, as that is the fair market value of the property given. One million dollars is worth exactly one million dollars. Consider this second scenario: The father creates a FLP with himself the General Partner holding a 50% interest and also holds the Limited Partner interest of 50%. He contributes the $1,000,000 in cash, and then gives his son the 50% Limited Partner interest. The fair market value is not 50% of the $1,000,000 although at first it might seem this is the case. A hypothetical willing buyer of the 50% LP interest would not be willing to pay $500,000. This is due to the lack of control and lack of marketability. Someone getting $500,000 cash can do with it as they please. Someone with a partnership interest worth $500,000, but that can't be collected until the GP declares a distribution (which may be many years away) is not as desirable, and a hypothetical and savvy buyer would factor this into their calculation of what they are willing to pay. Similarly, this asset cannot be sold or converted, and as a result, is less desirable than an equivalent amount of cash or marketable assets. If an appraisal firm is engaged and values the 50% LP interest at $400,000, reflecting appropriate discounts for lack of control and lack of marketability in compliance with IRS regulations, the grantor (the father) has only to pay gift tax on $400,000, saving his marginal tax rate times $100,000 ($500,000 cash value minus $400,000 fair market value). This savings would be reduced by any expenses incurred to establish the FLP (attorney and accountant fees) and also by the expenses incurred to hire a qualified appraiser to determine appropriate discounts for lack of control and lack of marketability. It is important to note that while FLPs are completely legal, deliberately engaging in any practice the IRS deems to be specifically undertaken to evade paying taxes is illegal. Determination of the fair market value must be performed by a qualified appraiser, typically defined as someone certified to perform such work (either by the American Society of Appraisers, the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute, or another similar organization), someone who routinely performs this type of work as a normal course of business, and in compliance with federal and state laws, as well as generally accepted appraisal standards and the Uniform Standards of the Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). FLPs should be formed as long-term family investment asset vehicles. In addition to investing in marketable securities, the GP can purchase alternative investments, such as hedge fund and private equity interests. Another \\"alternative investment\\" would be an interest in a closely held business created by one of the LPs. In this way, the FLP can serve as a vehicle for encouraging family entrepreneurship. An LP (e.g. a son or daughter of the founder) could submit a business plan and request seed capital or a loan for a new venture. An FLP can also be formed as a family limited liability company (FLLC), which offers legal advantages over an LP. While the GP of an FLP is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the FLP, no \\"member\\" (instead of \\"partner\\") of a FLLC is personally liable. Furthermore, in an FLLC, there are no restrictions on members participating in management, unlike the restrictions on LPs. A FLLC is often managed by a group of \\"managing members\\" or one or more \\"managers\\". Because an FLP or FLLC is a real business entity, it should be treated as one. Meetings should be held on a regular basis to review the conduct of the entity's investment business. The entity must make any distributions proportionately to all partners or members. It should never be used as the personal bank account of the founder.

It is in Gua Nasib Bagus (Good Luck Cave), which is located in Gunung Mulu National Park, in the Malaysian state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo.  Discovery  The chamber was discovered by three British cavers, Andy Eavis, Dave Checkley and Tony White, in January 1981 during the Mulu'80 Expedition. The story of how it was discovered is told in the books Underground Worlds and Giant Caves of Borneo. Later named Sarawak Chamber, it measures long, wide and a maximum of high, and was estimated as three times the size of the Big Room in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico, then thought to be the largest underground chamber. Its volume and area were checked by laser scanning in 2011 and were found to be and respectively.Kirby (2011:23) To reach Sarawak Chamber, one must follow a river upstream from the cave entrance. This long passage has a roof up to high, and may require some swimming and a traverse along a ledge. Accompanied visits can be arranged by the national Park.Gunung Mulu World Heritage Area, Cave activities  Geology and formation  Sarawak Chamber is formed in Melinau Limestone, a reef complex of Upper Eocene to Lower Miocene age. It was formed by karstic solutional processes in addition to the erosion of its sandstone basement. Its exceptional area is thought to be the result of the stability provided by the structure of the rocks in which it lies, dipping strata forming an anticline flank close to a syncline axis.  Fiction  The feeling of agoraphobia experienced by one of the discoverers is referenced in the novel House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski.

It is a herb that spends its entire life cycle, including flowering, at or below the soil surface. A head of up to 100 small reddish to cream-coloured, inward facing flowers surrounded by large, cream-coloured bracts with a horizontal rhizome is produced between May and July. Description Rhizanthella gardneri is a leafless, sympodial herb with a horizontal rhizome below the soil surface. Beginning in late May to early June, the plant produces up to 100 small, inward-facing pinkish to deep red and cream coloured flowers wide, surrounded by six to twelve pinkish-cream bracts. The bracts curve over the flowers, forming a tulip-like head and leaving a small opening at, or a few millimetres above the soil surface. After pollination, each flower produces a fleshy, berry-like fruit containing up to 150 seeds. Unlike the capsules of other orchids that produce minute, dust-like seeds dispersed by the wind, this species produces indehiscent fruit.H√°gsater, E. and Dumont, V. (1996) Orchids: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan. IUCN/SSC Orchid Specialist Group, IUCN, Gland. Discovery, taxonomy and naming John Trott discovered the first specimen of R. gardneri during ploughing operations in May 1928 on his farm near Corrigin. The discovery generated such excitement that a wax model was toured around the British Isles. Specimens were found a further six times in similar circumstances between the Corrigin and Dowerin areas, until 1959. The next confirmed sighting was by John McGuiness near Munglinup in 1979, of plants in their natural habitat. In 1981 and 1982, surveys in the Munglinup area located more than on hundred flowering specimens. The Munglinup population is now regarded as the separate species, Rhizanthella johnstonii. Rhizanthella gardneri was first formally described in 1928 by Richard Sanders Rogers in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia from specimens collected near Corrigin in May of the same year. The specific epithet (gardneri) honours Charles Gardner, assistant botanist to the Western Australian Government at that time. Distribution and habitat Rhizanthella gardneri is only known from the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region of Western Australia, where it grows in association with broom honeymyrtle (Melaleuca uncinata), between Corrigin and Babakin. Ecology As with other orchids in the genus Rhizanthella, all parts of the life cycle of R. gardneri, including flowering, are subterranean. The orchid obtains its energy and nutrients as a myco-heterotroph via mycorrhizal fungi that form associations with the roots of broombush species including M. uncinata, M. scalena and M. hamata. The fungus involved is thought to be Thanatephorus gardneri. The flowers of R. gardneri are subterranean but the heads crack open the soil surface as they mature, and sometimes the tips of the bracts protrude through the leaf litter, leaving a small opening through which pollinators may enter. Termites and ants have been seen to enter the flower heads. The orchid's seeds are too large to be dispersed by the wind and it is possible that the succulent fruit is eaten by small mammals and the seeds passed out of their faeces. Conservation status The species is classified as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). Much of the central and southern Wheatbelt of Western Australia has been cleared for agriculture, or affected by drought, resulting in the loss of broombush habitat or a reduction in the level of bark and leaf litter necessary to protect the underground orchid and a reduction in the area suitable for translocation. The main threats to the species include lack of suitable habitat, degraded habitat, drought and rising soil salinity. Three of the known populations of Rhizanthella gardneri are protected within nature reserves, and a concerted initiative has been launched to safeguard this species for future generations. A partnership between the Millennium Seed Bank of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Australia's Endangered Species Program and Perth's Kings Park and Botanic Gardens are undertaking DNA fingerprinting and seed-banking of this rare orchid in an attempt to establish a propagation programme.

Career He graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli and went on to pursue a diploma in film direction from Film and Television Institute of Tamil Nadu, Chennai. His directorial debut Aval Appadithan 'made an impact at the time of its release because its story and dialogues were different from many other Tamil films. The photography throughout the film emphasises moods by using shadows, and close-up shots are used extensively. Jump cuts are also common throughout the film. Aval Appadithan is considered as a milestone in Tamil film history. Indian filmmaker Mrinal Sen remarked that the film \\"was far ahead of the times\\". Rudraiah's second film, Gramathu Athiyayam (1980) was a rural tale set in a rustic Tamil village. Despite the success of his first film, Rudraiah found it difficult to continue making films as a result of the changing style of the film industry and the audience's preference for star- driven projects. In 1982, he began a venture titled Raja Ennai Mannithuvidu featuring Kamal Haasan, Chandrahasan, Sujatha and Sumalatha, which dealt with conflicts between two brothers. The film was shot simultaneously in Telugu and was 40% complete, when Kamal Haasan pulled out citing he wanted to work on scripts with more star value, and the film eventually was thereafter shelved. The songs recorded for the film by Ilaiyaraaja were later used in other ventures. Rudraiah then announced another film titled Unmayai Thedi which also failed to materialise, before he began work on the road movie, TXT7 in 1988. Written by Sujatha Rangarajan, the team signed on Raghuvaran to play the lead role of a taxi driver and L. Vaidyanathan to compose music. However financial problems meant that the film was soon after indefinitely postponed. The failure for his own productions to take off meant that by 1990, Rudraiah was open to directing films for other producers and began work on a tragic love story titled Kadalpurathil featuring Archana. Soon after production began, the makers decided to change the lead actress and create it as a television film instead, and it was later premi√®red on Doordarshan. Death Rudraiah died in Chennai on 18 November 2014 at the age of 67 after an illness.

The specific rules such as the tax rate of entertainment tax and cases of tax exemption are subject to local authorities, as is their collection. The entertainment tax has in the most cases the form of indirect tax, which is levied on buyer. Nowadays, the most discussed subject of those taxes are their implementations to online services, especially the ones working on streaming basis such as Netflix, Spotify and others. India In India, Entertainment Tax is a tax imposed by the government on feature films getting a wide release in the country and are reduced from gross collections, major commercial shows and big private festivals. The amount after deducting entertainment tax is known as net. In Delhi, movie tickets, large commercial shows and large private festival celebrations may incur an entertainment tax.Business of Bollywood: Why Rs 100 crore is the Biggest Star in Bollywood Entertainment falls in List 2 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and is exclusively reserved as a revenue source for the state governments. Historically, before India acquired independence, British government imposed heavy taxes on the events of amusements and entertainment, where a large gathering of Indians could have caused rebellion or mutiny. Thus, various entertainment tax acts of the state governments permit the rate of tax beyond 100%. After independence, old enactments continued and there has been no revision or repeal of these acts. This source of revenue has grown with the advent of pay television services in India. Since, entertainment is being provided through the services such as broadcasting services, DTH Services, Pay TV Services, cable services, etc. The component of entertainment is intrinsically intertwined in the transaction of service, that it can not be separated from the whole transaction. Given the nature of transaction of service, it is being subjected to tax by the Union and the State governments both. The fiscal principle underlying article 246 of the constitution of India separates the sources of taxation for the Union and the States and also maintains the exclusivity. This article also provides that in case of conflict between the powers of Union and the States, the Union power to tax shall supersede the power of the State to levy tax on the taxable event or in relation to the subject or object of taxation. Entertainment tax structure in India varies across states and is the highest in Uttar Pradesh at 60 per cent. In Maharashtra, entertainment tax was reduced by five per cent in 2005 and now stands at 45 per cent. There is no tax for Marathi films in Maharashtra, and in Tamil Nadu, Tamil films are tax free if they have a Tamil title and a U certificate from the Censor Board. Failing any of these, films are imposed a 15% tax. The entertainment industry in India is facing the challenge of double taxation on such transactions.http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/expanded-tax-regime- opposed/article4313280.ece No State Entertainment Tax Applicable on Gross Tkt Value . # Andhra Pradesh - 20% (15% for Telugu Films) # Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, Punjab and Uttaranchal (Nil) # Bihar - 50.00% # Delhi- 20.00% # Gujarat -20.00% (Nil for Gujrati Films) # Haryana -30.00% # Jharkhand -110% (Nil for Jharkhand Films) # Karnataka -30% (Nil for Kannada Films) # Kerala- 30.00% # Madhya Pradesh -20.00% # Maharashtra -45% (Nil for Marathi Films) # Odisha -25.00% (Nil for Odia Films) # Tamil Nadu -15% (Nil for Tamil Films) # Uttar Pradesh -30% to 40% # West Bengal- 30% (2% for Bengali Films) =Maharashtra Entertainment Duty Act, 1923= The Maharashtra government imposed an additional 10 percent entertainment duty on movie tickets priced between Rs.251 and Rs.350 from January 16, 2013.

Nowadays, the amusement tax is levied on cultural events (performances, exhibitions, etc.), commercial events (promotional shows, presentations), sport events of any kind (car races, tennis, horse-races, etc.), entertainment activities for public participation or attended based on paid membership (sport clubs, etc.) and virtually provided amusement services (paid television programmes, etc.) based on streaming basis. The general exemptions are events with religious purposes, events to support the veterans and generally all non- profiting events. The City of Chicago offers at their online site templates for amusement providers to be filled as well as complete guide regarding the amusement tax and the liabilities. =Amendments= The amusement tax in Chicago has been in effect since 17 February 1986 and has gone through several amendments. It is assigned to section 4-156 in Chicago municipal code. In 1999 the tax rate for middle-sized (750-5,000 people) events was reduced to 3%. Although, the first major amendment was in July 2004 where the original concept was enlarged by above mentioned paid television programmes and paid membership activities. The largest and nowadays most discussed amendment came into effect on 1 July 2015. It introduced a general 9% tax rate with exception for registered reseller for whom the rate is 3% and since 2018 the rate was decreased to 5% for cultural performances which are held in auditoriums with maximum capacity exceeding 750 persons. This rule was changed later that year and now there is total exemption from the tax if the event is live performance and the capacity is less than 1,500 persons. However, the controversy part of this amendment was including the digital streaming and online entertainment platforms as well (Netflix, Spotify, etc.), this expansion is often referred to as \\"Netflix tax\\" or \\"Cloud tax\\". However, this affects only temporary services, e.g. the music tracks, movies, games and other online goods bought online and downloaded permanently are not subject to this tax (it is subject to digital sales tax, which in the state of Illinois is equal to 6.25%). =Controversy= The new enlargement for \\"Netflix tax\\" was predicted to bring $12 million to the treasury of the city and help to decrease the city's budget deficit which was in 2016 around $500 million. However, the new amusement tax is subject to widespread criticism because of violations of other federal laws, state laws and precedent of the Supreme Court. Besides what is mentioned above, this taxation also violates the Internet Tax Freedom Act on the Federal level and the Commerce Clause. As for the State level, the Department of Finance executives are in clash with Illinois' executives and the uniformity of requirements is therefore not existing.

It was discovered in 1847 by R.C Gunn and evidence exists that it once lived in Antarctica.Reid, James B.; Hill, Robert S.; Brown, Michael J.; & Hovenden, Mark J. (2005) Vegetation of Tasmania. Monotone art printers. N. gunnii is a small woody tree with a shrubby appearance known to grow up to . It lives only on mountains due to temperature limitations within the Tasmanian maritime climate and can survive up to heights of . It grows in alpine and sub-alpine regions in the west to central portions of the state but is absent from the mountains of the northeast. Though capable of reaching the size of a small tree, it rarely exceeds in height, instead growing as a thick shrub or as a woody ground cover hence its common name of \\"tanglefoot\\". Taxonomy Joseph Dalton Hooker described the tanglefoot beech. Common names include tanglefoot- or deciduous beech, or fagus, which can also refer to the entire Beech family. The species was renamed as Fuscospora gunnii by New Zealand scientists. The change in name is controversial, and it is not necessary to accept this change.Hill, R.S.; Jordan, G.J.; Macphail, M.K. 2015: Why we should retain Nothofagus sensu lato. Australian systematic botany, 28(3): 190-193. doi10.1071/SB15026 Description Nothofagus gunnii is a small tree which may grow up to 3 metres tall (growth habit is heavily dependent on the exposure of the site) and has a thick shrubby appearance due to substantial branching. The alternating leaves are simple and ovate with toothed margins and attached by short petioles. Leaf lamina is generally <20mm in length and is distinctly 'crinkled'. It is most easily visually separated from the other Tasmanian species from the same genus, Nothofagus cunninghamii, by the crinkled appearance of the leaf lamina. During Autumn and Winter months, the leaves undergo colour change as any other deciduous species does. The leaves of this deciduous species have an average lifespan of around 5 months. The leaves are simple and alternate, growing 1 cm long. The leaf color is bright green, turning yellow, then brilliant red, in autumn. They are almost circular in shape with deep veins which end in the gaps between the rounded teeth on the leaf. The plant has separate male and female flowers on the tree. Both male and female flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruit is small (about 6 mm wide) and woody, and contains three small winged nuts. In most years seed production is poor, but once in a while a 'mast' crop occurs with high germination. The seeds have a very short viability. Tanglefoot forests cannot survive fire, and must re-establish from neighbouring areas. They are very sensitive to changed conditions due to their slow growth. Under 100 km¬≤ of forest remain. It is the only native deciduous tree in Tasmania, and the only cold climate winter-deciduous tree in Australia. Distribution Nothofagus gunnii is endemic to the island of Tasmania, and is restricted to high altitude and relatively high rainfall areas with no recent fire activity. It was discovered at the summit of Mount Olympus in central Tasmania, and is also known at several locations within the Mount Field National Park and on Cradle Mountain.George, Alexander S.; & Mackay, David (1989) \\"Flora of Australia: Volume 3: Hamamelidales to Casuarinales. Australian Government Publishing Service. It is considered a paleoendemic species to Tasmania as macrofossils have been discovered within Oligocene sediments both in Tasmania and Antarctica. Cultivation Nothofagus gunnii required around 1,800 mm of rain spread throughout the year to be cultivated, cool temperatures not below -10 ¬∞C and also requires full sun. It grows in deep peaty soils. It is best grown from fresh seed collected in a 'mast' year, germinating in a few weeks. It is believed that a beneficial mycorrhyzal fungus is required for the long term success of the plant. Cuttings can be struck, taken in late winter before bud burst. Nothofagus gunnii is rarely seen in cultivation due to its poor performance and slow growth. It is believed to be a candidate plant for bonsai. Ecology and reproduction Nothofagus gunnii exists only in alpine and sub-alpine environments on mountains within Tasmania. The species is generally limited to heights above due to the temperature and relatively short snow lie duration within the Tasmanian oceanic climate. It may live as a dominant low shrubby tree on open, generally sloping, rocky ground. F. gunnii habitation is severely limited by fire regimes as it is extremely fire sensitive and will not survive burning. Local extinctions of the species have been attributed to fire in the Denison Range. Despite the limited range of Nothofagus gunnii, the species is not listed as endangered. Although very few data are recorded about reproductive methods of F. gunnii, it may be assumed that seeds are wind dispersed and that the species are mast seeders as is displayed in similar species such as Nothofagus cunninghamii.

History Established in May 1950, the Beijing Film Academy was first named Performance Art Institution of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture. During its first year, 38 students enrolled. For the next five years, the school was renamed thrice - Film School of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture in July 1951, Beijing Film School in March 1953 and finally, Beijing Film Academy on June 1, 1956. Upon its first establishment, the academy contained 2 schools - the School of Photography and the Animation School with the associated departments and their subsequent specialties. The Screenwriting Department was one of the earliest departments to be established at the academy in 1951. Gradually, the academy expanded its number of schools and departments. On September 14, 1950, BFA offered its first undergraduate course in performing arts. The course attracted a class of 30 students, many of which were notable figures in film and television. Due to its success, BFA established the Performance Institute in June 1956. In 1952, BFA offered its first programs in sound recording. The Department of Sound Recording was officially founded in 1959. The Department of Sound Recording continued to grow throughout the years. In 1960, BFA's Department of Sound Recording and the School of Engineering were joined together. BFA began offering a two-year course in film and television production management in September 1955. Although the first class only graduated 28 students, the popularity of the course grew, and a Department of Management was formally established in 1987. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution brought hardships for schools throughout the People's Republic of China. BFA was equally affected; many of its professors left the academy. However, in the beginning of 1976, after the end of the Cultural Revolution, many faculty members returned to BFA. By 1977, the academy had recovered from the Cultural Revolution. Finally, in 1978, the academy allowed new students to apply. =Recent history= In 1989, the International School of the Academy was set up, along with the Information Research Center in October 1999. Individual departments have also developed recently. Major development of the screenwriting department was the establishment of a postgraduate course with master's degree in Screenwriting in 1985, followed by the construction of the undergraduate program on Film Theories in 1987. Further postgraduate courses for Ph.D. students in Screenwriting were set up in 2004. Academics The academy offers associate, bachelor, and master's degrees in many areas of film. BFA offers courses in script writing, film theory, film directing, film and television production, film acting, film and television art design, advertisements, animations, sound art, cinematography, photography, and entertainment management. thumb Courses other than the undergraduate and postgraduate studies are also offered. These are: * Correspondence courses * Night school courses * Vocational courses =Schools and departments= Presently, there are nine schools that make up the Beijing Film Academy: *Management School *International Studies School *Continuing Education School *Audio-Visual Arts and Communication School *Animation School *Photography School *Fine Arts School *Sound School *Performing Arts School The eight departments and their twelve associated specialities are: * Department of Film and TV technology/Digital Media Institute ** Digital film and television technology * Film and television technology ** Film and television technology * Department of Film directing ** Film directing * Department of Film Theory ** Film studies * Department of Management ** Film production management and distribution * Department of Photography ** Cinematography * Department of Screenwriting and Cinema Studies ** Film screenwriting * Department of Sound Recording **Basic Education =Admissions= The admission rate at Beijing Film Academy is one of the lowest in the country, as well as globally. Admission is extremely competitive. Over 40,000 students apply annually to participate in entrance exams. Only 400-500 students are accepted. The majority of the admissions process takes place in February and March. The entrance examinations include subject tests as well as the National Humanities Examination. Prospective acting majors usually have the most intense competition.Interview with Professor Zhang Hui-jun, President of the Beijing Film Academy Harvard Asia Quarterly. Volume VII, No. 3, 2003. Retrieved 14 August 2006. International students looking to study at Beijing Film Academy may apply through the International Training Center. In 2013, the Academy will conduct its first undergraduate film production program in English. This program will be conducted by the Cinematography department with a focus on cinematography, directing and post-production. Notable alumni Zhao Wei Chen Kun Huang Shengyi Liu Yifei For over forty years, graduates of the Beijing Film Academy have won national and international acclaim for their contributions to film and television. Their notable alumni include directors, producers, screenwriters, as well as actors and actresses. The majority of famous recent graduates are actors and actresses, as well as a few directors. BFA's older famous graduates mostly consist of fourth-generation, fifth-generation, and sixth-generation directors. The most well-known fourth-generation directors include Wu Tianming, Wu Yigong, Teng Wenji, and Zhang Nuanxin. The three best- known fifth-generation directors all graduated from BFA (Tian Zhuangzhuang, Chen Kaige, and Zhang Yimou). Other famous Chinese filmmakers include Xie Tian, Chen Qiang, Wu Yigong, Huang Shuqin, Wu Tianming, Xie Fei, Hu Mei, Zheng Dongtian, Ni Zhen, Ding Yinmeng, Li Qiankuan, Cao Cuifen, Huang Jianxin, and Wei Lian. Finally, notable sixth-generation directors include Jia Zhangke, Wang Xiaoshuai, and Zhang Yuan.

During both wars, the university allowed the U.S. military to use parts of its grounds for weapons development and testing. In 1917, 24 days after the United States declared war on Germany, the university offered its property to the war effort. The military divided the campus into two segments, Camp American University and Camp Leach. The two camps were considered at the time to be \\"the largest laboratory this side of the sun or other burning stars.\\" Thus, during World War I, Camp American University became the birthplace of the United States' chemical weapons program. It may have been \\"the largest research and development facility for chemical weapons anywhere in the world during the First World War\\". About 100,000 soldiers and 2,000 chemists were employed on the campus. At the far corner of the university, the military also tested some of its weapons. When the war had ended it was reported that $800,000 (in 1918-dollars) worth of World War I munitions were buried in a pit in the same corner of the university. In 1993, a construction worker stumbled upon some of the buried munitions. The next day it was reported in The Washington Post that World War I bomb shells had been unearthed near a Senator's house bordering the university grounds. This led to major cleanup efforts in the 1990s and 2000s (decade) on the site, which included a corner of the university and several neighboring residences, one of them the Embassy of South Korea. As of 2009, an estimated $170 million had been spent over a sixteen-year period, searching for chemical weapons in the Spring Valley neighborhood where Camp American University was located.

It was located at 201 West Harrison Street on a block bounded by Harrison, Wells and Polk Streets and the Chicago River in the southwestern portion of the Chicago Loop. Grand Central Station was designed by architect Solon Spencer Beman for the Wisconsin Central Railroad (WC), and was completed by the Chicago and Northern Pacific Railroad. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad purchased the station in 1910 and used it as the Chicago terminus for its passenger rail service, including its Capitol Limited service to Washington, D.C. Major tenant railroads included the Soo Line Railroad, successor to the Wisconsin Central, the Chicago Great Western Railway, and the Pere Marquette Railway. The station opened December 8, 1890, closed November 8, 1969, and was demolished in 1971. Construction In October 1889, a subsidiary of the Wisconsin Central Railroad began constructing a new passenger terminal at the southwest corner of Harrison and Wells Streets (then called Fifth Avenue) in Chicago, to replace a nearby temporary facility. The location of this new depot, along the south branch of the Chicago River, was selected to take advantage of the bustling passenger and freight market traveling on nearby Lake Michigan. The waiting room of Grand Central Station had ceilings; the floor was made of marble. Architect Solon S. Beman, who had gained notoriety as the designer of the Pullman company neighborhood, designed the station in the Norman Castellated and chose brick, brownstone and granite for construction. The structure measured along Harrison Street and along Wells. Imposing arches, crenellations, a spacious arched carriage-court facing Harrison Street, and a multitude of towers dominated the walls. Its most famous feature, however, was an impressive tower at the northeast corner of the structure. Beman, an early advocate of the Floating raft system to solve Chicago's unique swampy soil problems, designed the tower to sit within a floating foundation supported by deep piles. Early on, an bell in the tower rang on the hour. At some point, however, the bell was removed, but the tower (and its huge clock, in diameter‚Äîat one time among the largest in the United States, remained. The interior of Grand Central Station was decorated as extravagantly as the exterior. The waiting room, for example, had marble floors, Corinthian-style columns, stained-glass windows and a marble fireplace, and a restaurant. The station also had a 100-room hotel, but accommodations ended late in 1901. The train shed of Grand Central Station Not as famous as the clocktower but equally architecturally unique was Grand Central Station's self-supporting glass and steel train shed, , among the largest in the world at the time it was constructed. The trainshed, considered an architectural gem and a marvel of engineering long after it was built, housed six tracks and had platforms long enough to accommodate fifteen-car passenger trains. The final construction cost totaled over one million dollars. The Chicago and Northern Pacific Railroad, a subsidiary of the Northern Pacific Railway, formally opened Grand Central Station December 8, 1890. Seeking access to the Chicago railway market, the Northern Pacific had purchased Grand Central and the trackage leading to it from the Wisconsin Central with the intention of making the station its eastern terminus. When it opened, Grand Central hosted trains from the WC (which connected with its former trackage in Forest Park, Illinois), and the Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad (M&NW;), which made also a connection at Forest Park. By December 1891, the tenants also included the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and in 1903, the Pere Marquette Railway also started using the station. Weakened by the prolonged economic downturn of the Panic of 1893, the Northern Pacific went bankrupt in October 1893, and was forced to end its ownership of the Chicago and Northern Pacific, including Grand Central Station. Ultimately, tenant railroad Baltimore and Ohio purchased the station at foreclosure in 1910 along with all the terminal trackage to form the Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad (B&OCT;). Services Rock Island Line trackage. The smallest of Chicago's passenger rail terminals, Grand Central Station was a relatively quiet place, even during its heyday. Grand Central never became a prominent destination for large numbers of cross-country travelers, nor for the daily waves of commuters from the suburbs, that other Chicago terminals were. In 1912, for example, Grand Central served 3,175 passengers per day‚Äîrepresenting only 4.5 percent of the total number for the city of Chicago‚Äîand serviced an average of 38 trains per day (including 4 B&O; suburban trains). This number paled in comparison to the 146 trains served by Dearborn Station, the 191 by LaSalle Street Station, the 281 at Union Station, the 310 by the Chicago and North Western Terminal and the 373 trains per day at Central Station. The station did host some of Baltimore and Ohio's most famous passenger trains, including the Capitol Limited to Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, however, the circuitous trackage leading to the station from the east forced these trains miles out of their way through the industrial southwest and west side of the city (See map to the left). Other tenants such as the Soo Line Railroad (which purchased the WC in 1909), the M&NW; (which became known as the Chicago Great Western Railway in 1893), and the Pere Marquette Railway (which merged into the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1947), were nowhere near the scale of B&O;'s operations in the intercity passenger rail market. =Intercity Passenger Trains= The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Capitol Limited at Grand Central Station in 1967. Grand Central Station served as a terminal for the following lines and intercity trains: *Baltimore and Ohio Railroad: Capitol Limited, Columbian, and Shenandoah to New York City and the Chicago - Washington Express to Washington, D.C., along with other trains to Cumberland, Maryland and Wheeling, West Virginia. *Chicago Great Western Railway (until 1956): Legionnaire, later Minnesotan, both to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Other trains to Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska. All passenger services ceased in 1956. *Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway (Soo Line) (until 1899, and from 1912 to 1965; used Central Station in between and after): Laker to Duluth, Minnesota. *Pere Marquette Railway: Grand Rapids Flyer and Grand Rapids Express to Grand Rapids and Muskegon, Michigan and, ultimately to Buffalo, New York. Resort Special to Bay View via Traverse City and Petoskey. Upon the 1947 merger with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, PM trains were renamed Pere Marquette, except the Resort Special kept its name. *From December 1900 to July 1903, the New York Central Railroad and Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad used Grand Central, as their LaSalle Street Station was being rebuilt. =Suburban commuter trains= In addition to intercity passenger rail service, Grand Central Station hosted several short- lived intraurban passenger rail operations. To coincide with the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, the Baltimore and Ohio operated a special passenger train between Grand Central Station and Jackson Park, with intermediate stops at Halsted Street, Blue Island Avenue, Ashland Avenue and Ogden Avenue. Grand Central Station also served as a terminal for at least three suburban commuter lines. One, operated by the Wisconsin Central, operated trains west of Grand Central Station to Altenheim. The second began service in 1900 by the Chicago Terminal Transfer Railroad, and continued when B&O; purchased the line in 1910. It operated six trains a day between Grand Central and Chicago Heights, stopping in Blue Island, Harvey, Thornton and Glenwood. The line was unsuccessful and ended as early as 1915. The third was run by the Chicago Great Western. It ran through Forest Park to Elmhurst, Lombard, Glen Ellyn, Gretna (Carol Stream), Ingalton (West Chicago), St. Charles, Wasco, Lily Lake, Virgil, Sycamore, and DeKalb. It was also short lived. Service was discontinued in 1906. None of the other tenant railroads operated commuter trains from Grand Central Station. Closure and demolition Grand Central Station, looking south down Wells Street in 1963. The lightly used terminal became even quieter in the years following World War II, with Grand Central serving 26 intercity passenger trains, down from nearly 40 at its busiest. Passenger trains were dropped and service was curtailed, and by 1956 the Chicago Great Western, which as late as 1940 had run six trains per day in and out of Grand Central\\"Chicago Great Western Public Timetable\\", dated March 1, 1940 ceased operating passenger service into Chicago. As a result, by 1963 only ten intercity trains remained, of which six were operated by the Baltimore and Ohio. The number of passengers that used the remaining service shrank proportionately: by 1969, the year the station closed, the station only served an average of 210 passengers per day. Due to its small size, its age and perceived obsolescence, Grand Central was the target of a long-term political effort by the city government to encourage consolidation of passenger terminals in the south Loop. It was ultimately this political effort that sealed the fate of Grand Central, described in 1969 as \\"decaying, dreary, and sadly out of date\\". Faced with decreasing passenger numbers and intense political pressure to consolidate, the railroads operating into Grand Central Station re-routed their trains into other Chicago terminals, beginning with the Soo Line into Central Station in 1963. The remaining six Baltimore and Ohio and ex-Pere Marquette trains last used Grand Central Station on November 8, 1969 and were routed into their new terminus at the Chicago and North Western Terminal the following day. Sitting unused, Grand Central Station's value as an architectural and engineering masterpiece was discounted by its railroad owner, who believed the value of the land for urban redevelopment to be quite substantial. As a result, the trackage was scrapped and the entire terminal was razed by the railroad in 1971. Present day Approximately 6.5 acres remain vacant between Harrison and Polk; the site currently serves as a de facto dog park in the South Loop. In 1984, developers began construction of River City, just south of the site. River City was intended to be a complex of four 85-story office and residential towers stretching along the Chicago River from Harrison to Roosevelt Road designed by Bertrand Goldberg, designer of the landmark \\"Marina City\\" along the main branch of the Chicago River). Only a 17-story apartment building was completed in 1986, however it can accommodate additional floors as part of an expansion. Several other plans for office towers, condominiums, or retail development on the site have all been proposed over the past several years, and all have been shelved. The land at the corner of Harrison and Wells, the lot on which the station itself stood, remains vacant. In March 2008, CSX Transportation ‚Äì the successor company to the B&O; ‚Äì sold the property to a Skokie, Illinois-based capital group with the intent of redeveloping the site with mixed-use high-rise buildings. MGLM Architects proposed constructing a new rail station on the site in February 2012 to accommodate high-speed trains between the city core and O'Hare Airport. The firm claimed that this location would be preferable to adding additional capacity at the already crowded Union Station. As of October 2013, a proposal to build two towers containing 700 units (rental & possibly condo apartments) has resurfaced for 1.5 acres of the 6.5 acre site. The development known as \\"Franklin Point\\" is being backed by Jay-Z business partners Arnold \\"Alex\\" Bize and Naum Chernyavsky. In September 2016, construction began on a new development named Project Riverline; a joint venture between CMK Companies and Lendlease. The redevelopment will consist of over 3,600 residences spread across eight waterfront buildings, and is estimated to be completed in 2024. =Legacy= More than thirty years after its demolition, Grand Central Station has only relatively recently been identified by local historians, railroad enthusiasts and architecture critics as \\"the queen of the city's old train stations\\". Author Carl W. Condit remarked that the station was \\"an important Chicago building even if it never received much recognition\\". Architect Harry Weese bemoaned its \\"wanton destruction\\". Ira J. Bach noted that when the terminal was demolished: \\"Chicago lost its greatest monument to the institution which had created it: the railroad.\\" =The B&OCT; Bascule Bridge= Looking southwest, the B&OCT; bascule bridge over the Chicago River is in the foreground, locked in an upright position. The St. Charles Air Line Railroad bridge is behind. (c. 1988) At the time Grand Central was completed, passenger trains approached the terminal by crossing the Chicago River to the southwest over a bridge between Taylor Street and Roosevelt Road, constructed in 1885. This first bridge was replaced by a taller structure in 1901 to accommodate larger boats and ships on the south branch of the river. When the Chicago River was straightened and widened in the 1930s, the United States Department of War insisted the Baltimore and Ohio build a new bridge adjacent to that of the St. Charles Air Line Railroad which crossed the river between 15th and 16th Streets. The new bridge's location (), about seven blocks south of its previous crossing, exacerbated the circuitous route of the Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad (B&OCT;) trackage leading to Grand Central Station. Both the B&OCT; bascule bridge, and that of the St. Charles Air Line Bridge, also a bascule bridge immediately adjacent to it, were built in 1930. the B&OCT; bridge sits unused.

While Jasmin and Oliver‚Äôs imperfect lives are about to take an interesting turn, an unexpected change comes from Nea, who is now dead-set on destroying the life of her estranged father. But what brought about this change in Nea? And how will it affect the Ynares family? On the same day that Nea's mother dies, Nea is picked by a strange man who drugs and takes advantage of her. She later finds out it was Ivan Ynares. Jasmin and Oliver break up due to Nea's rape allegations and also because Oliver thinks Jasmin was cheating on him with her childhood friend.

After a brief hiatus, they released their seventh number-one single, . In 2008, they performed at the Tokyo Dome for the first time, and released their tenth single, \\"Happy Birthday\\", which made NEWS the second Japanese group after label-mates KinKi Kids to have ten consecutive number-one singles since their debut. NEWS became a quartet following the departures of Ryo Nishikido and Tomohisa Yamashita from the group in 2011. NEWS became a trio following the departure of Yuya Tegoshi in 2020. History =2003‚Äì2006: Debut and departure of members= Formed in September 2003, NEWS released a promotional single, , which was used as the theme song for the World Cup of Volleyball Championships.

In January 2006, NEWS was reduced to six members when Hironori Kusano was suspended indefinitely for the same charge as Uchi. NEWS released their fifth single, (March 2006), which was their fifth consecutive number-one single.

It stars Mick Molloy, Bob Franklin and Judith Lucy, with Alan Brough, Bill Hunter, Marshall Napier, Nicholas Bell, Steven Vidler, Shaun Micallef, Robyn Nevin, Brett Swain, Denis Moore and Pete Smith having supporting roles. Ben Kinnear (Molloy) and Mike Paddock (Franklin) are police officers working for the Zero Tolerance Unit, a special division of Victoria Police. When they accidentally shoot the corpse of a judge several times each, they are reprimanded but investigate his death, leading to several other accidents, for which they are relegated to uniform duty. Through Julie Bale (Lucy), a former police officer and Kinnear's ex, they uncover a conspiracy involving the ZTU with bribery and corruption. They are joined by computer operator Northey (Brough), but have to escape with their lives to avoid death at the hands of the ZTU's commander, Ted Pratt (Hunter) and the network of corruption extending all the way to the Premier of Victoria (Micallef). Tony Martin's, comedic style in the movie blends one-liners and slapstick with more sophisticated humour. The film marked Martin's directorial debut. Much of the cast and crew, including Molloy, Hunter, Martin and Lucy, had all worked on a previous film Crackerjack (2002). The film performed moderately well at the Australian box-office and was also released in New Zealand and Germany. Molloy's talent as an actor was praised in some circles, as was the ARIA Award-nominated soundtrack by Dave Graney and Clare Moore. Cast *Mick Molloy ‚Äì Detective Ben Kinnear *Bob Franklin ‚Äì Detective Mike Paddock *Bill Hunter ‚Äì ZTU Commander Ted Pratt *Judith Lucy ‚Äì Julie Bale *Alan Brough ‚Äì Northey *Shaun Micallef ‚Äì State Premier Lionel Cray *Marshall Napier ‚Äì Doug Gillespie *Nicholas Bell ‚Äì Detective Wicks *Steven Vidler ‚Äì Detective Pendlebury *Robyn Nevin ‚Äì Eleanor Poulgrain *Brett Swain ‚Äì Bartlett *Denis Moore ‚Äì Marcus Ridgeway *Pete Smith ‚Äì Darcy *Gina Riley ‚Äì TV Host *Tony Martin ‚Äì Quiz Show Host Gavin Clack Plot summary A Magistrate named Poulgrain takes his own life in an exhaust fume-filled car but in his death-throes, he releases the hand-brake whereupon his car rolls down the road all the way into the middle of a busy shopping centre where a pair of over-zealous detectives empty their firearms into his corpse. Disgraced, the two detectives, Ben Kinnear and his best mate Mike Paddock-both members of the much-hyped Zero Tolerance Unit (ZTU), are demoted back to uniform duties. Things get worse when they pay a visit to the Magistrate's widow Eleanor and accidentally burn her house down. Things become more complicated when Julie Bale, a journalist and a former police-officer and onetime partner of Kinnear's, is arrested on a charge of blackmailing the Magistrate. Kinnear starts to become suspicious when he discovers that a computer disc was found in the dead man's car but was tampered with by persons unknown. Kinnear's boss Gillespie questions the two detectives in charge of the Poulgrain case, Wicks and Pendlebury as to what happened to the original disc. Without warning, Wicks shoots dead Gillespie and Pendlebury and then deliberately wounds himself, re-arranging the crime scene to make it appear Pendlebury fired first. Kinnear and Paddock are both suspended from duty by newly returned ZTU chief Ted Pratt. But with the assistance of IT-operator Northey, they break into the police data-base unit and copy the original file. But Pratt and Wicks confront them before they can leave the building and it turns out that the file has been altered, now implicating Kinnear in corrupt activities. Kinnear and Paddock narrowly escape an assassination attempt when the latter's house is blown up by explosives set by Wicks. The two detectives are captured by Wicks and his cronies and are then confronted by Pratt, now revealed to be the ringleader of the ZTU corruption. It is now clear that Julie Bale is innocent, having been used as a convenient scapegoat because of her journalistic enquiries into the corruption allegations. It is also revealed that Poulgrain was involved in the corruption ring but, having gotten cold feet, had threatened to go public so Pratt had blackmailed him into committing suicide. Rescued by Northey, Kinnear and Paddock pursue their last option, going to the Premier of Victoria Lionel Cray. However whilst waiting outside his office, Kinnear eavesdrops on a phone-call between Cray and Pratt, revealing that even the Premier is heavily involved in corruption. Having recorded the phone-call, they kidnap Cray and take him to a deserted road outside of Melbourne, offering to exchange him for Bale who has been abducted by Pratt. In a tense stand-off, Pratt's plan to kill Kinnear, Paddock and Northey after getting the Premier back is foiled when, in a pre-arranged signal, Bale grabs a concealed gun attached to Cray and holds it to his head whilst Paddock aims an assault-rifle at Pratt and Wicks and their mini-van filled with heavily armed officers. Pratt surrenders and he and his cronies, along with Premier Cray, are all arrested for corruption. Kinnear and Paddock are re-instated and promoted and the former's old romance with Bale is re-ignited. Critical reception The film received mixed reviews. Amy Gough, writing in the Echo News, praised the film, stating \\"Bad Eggs is a romp with enough plot and intrigue to keep you guessing if not laughing heartily. It has more pace and edge than Molloy's last film Crackerjack...as well as a great soundtrack\\".BAD EGGS DIRECTED BY TONY MARTIN. murdoch.edu.au Scott Hamilton, for Pop-Planet, also liked the film, writing \\"It is very entertaining to watch Mick Molloy, Bob Franklin and Judith Lucy, who obviously have a well-rehearsed rapport with each other, work off each other\\". Clint Morris, writing on filmthreat.com in 2003, wrote that \\"Martin...shows potential in his first stint as director. The script's reasonably tight, the characters well-defined and everything kept an enjoyable-enough pace....There's a slight lag in some of the gags-they're giggle-worthy but not ecstatically funny. But the ones that do work-work quite well, and mainly because of the highly under-rated Molloy-he's the glue holding most of the film together.\\"BAD EGGS. filmthreat.com Sandra Hall, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, wrote that Martin \\"started with a list of set-pieces and tailored the script to suit. Martin works as if he's still hooked on the urge to produce loud laughter at regular intervals...He bustles and the more he bustles-the slower things get\\". Hall also felt that the comic style of the cast and the pace of the film's action were mismatched.Bad Eggs. The Sydney Morning Herald. (24 July 2003). Retrieved 26 December 2015. David Stratton, writing in Variety, gave a lukewarm response to the film, saying \\"Bad Eggs is a crime-comedy with more crime than comedy. At its best, it's pretty funny......however there's no escaping the fact that the plot...isn't exactly original and the inclusion of scenes familiar from other movies...only adds to a feeling of deja-vu\\". Stratton praised the performances of most of the cast but he felt that Hunter's role as Pratt was routine and Lucy's performance as Julie Bale showed that her brand of deadpan humour does not translate well to the big-screen.Bad Eggs. Variety (23 July 2003). Retrieved 26 December 2015. Andrew L Urban, for Yahoo, wrote \\"Encouraged by Crackerjack, perhaps I expected too much from Bad Eggs....There are a handful of good laughs..but the tone shifts, and shifts again., as if the storyline had taken control of the writing process, elbowing out the sense of humour\\". Box office Bad Eggs grossed $2,317,820 at the box office in Australia.

Built in December 1944 by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) of Schenectady, New York, No. 844 is the only operating example of just four surviving FEF Series locomotives. The locomotive operated in revenue service until 1959. It was initially placed into storage while awaiting withdrawal, along with the rest of the Union Pacific steam locomotive fleet. In 1960, railroad leaders recognized the benefits of having a steam program, and retained No. 844 for special activities, the kernel of what has become the Union Pacific heritage fleet. Today, it is one of UP's oldest serving locomotives and the only steam locomotive owned by a North American Class I railroad that has never been retired. Design In 1944, Union Pacific and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) collaborated on the FEF-3, a class of 10 locomotives designed to pull passenger trains at 90 mph. Theoretically, an FEF-3 could reach 120 mph and maintain it for a period of time; one locomotive reportedly pulled a 1,000-ton passenger train at 100 mph. All FEF classes were considered by the Union Pacific to be capable of producing between 4,000 and 5,000 drawbar horsepower. The FEF-3 class represented the epitome of dual- service steam locomotive development; funds and research were being concentrated into the development of diesel-electric locomotives. Originally designed to burn coal, they were converted to run on fuel oil in 1946. Like the earlier FEF-1 and FEF-2 classes, the FEF-3 locomotives were ultimately reassigned to freight service. History =Revenue service (1944-1959)= Union Pacific 844 hauling the Pony Express in 1949. UP 844 was the last steam locomotive delivered to the Union Pacific Railroad, constructed as a member of the FEF-3 class of 4-8-4 \\"Northern\\" type locomotives. Upon its entry into service, the locomotive spent most of its career pulling a variety of passenger trains, such as the Overland Limited, Los Angeles Limited, Portland Rose and Challenger.See Edmonson, Harold A. and Goodheart, David. \\"Union Pacific's 8444,\\" at 1 (1989, Goodheart Publications). From 1957 to 1959, UP 844 was reassigned to fast freight service in Nebraska when diesel-electric locomotives took over passenger service. After commercial steam operations ended in 1959, the 844 and the rest of the FEF-3 class was placed into storage. Saved from scrapping in 1960, No. 844 was chosen for rebuilding and is now used on company and public excursion trains, along with revenue freight during ferry moves. =Excursion career (1960-present)= SP 4449 on the Puget Sound Steam Special in 2007. UP 844 leads the now-discontinued Cheyenne Frontier Days Special near Platteville, Colorado, in 2007. Since 1960, No. 844 has run hundreds of thousands of miles as Union Pacific's publicity locomotive. Before it was discontinued in early 2019, the locomotive often pulled the annual Denver Post-sponsored Cheyenne Frontier Days train that ran round-trip from Cheyenne to Denver every July. It appeared at Expo '74 in Spokane, Washington; the 1978 dedication of the Utah State Railroad Museum in Ogden, Utah; the 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans; and the 50th anniversary celebration of Los Angeles Union Station in 1989, when it performed a side-by- side run with Southern Pacific 4449. On February 14, 1975, it pulled Amtrak's San Francisco Zephyr from Denver, Colorado, to Cheyenne, Wyoming, with a pair of EMD SDP40Fs. In 1981, it traveled to the opening of the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, along with Union Pacific 3985, which had recently been restored to operational condition. Over the weekend of October 14, 1990, No. 844 led a procession of special trains from Kansas City Union Station to Abilene, Kansas, for World War II veterans to celebrate the 100th birthday of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The \\"Eisenhower Centennial Special\\" was composed of cars from the Union Pacific, Burlington Northern, and Santa Fe Railway business fleets, with additional passenger cars provided by the Norfolk Southern and Chicago and North Western railroads. Present also in Abilene was General Eisenhower's command train, code-named \\"Bayonet\\", including the British A4 steam locomotive #60008 and communication and staff cars from WWII's European Theater of Operations. After the end of the 1991 excursion season, 844 was put in the shop for a major running gear overhaul in addition to other repairs. During that time, 844 was repainted from the passenger greyhound scheme to the freight black. It emerged from the shop in 1996. On June 21, 1997, on the way to the National Railway Historical Society (NRHS)'s annual convention, in Salt Lake City, Utah, 844 and Union Pacific's Executive E units pulled 18 passenger cars on the Union Pacific's soon-to- close Tennessee Pass line, which included tracks on a narrow canyon shelf along the Arkansas River. On June 24, 1999, while on display during RailFair '99, one of the 844's boiler tubes failed, and the locomotive was subsequently towed dead back to Cheyenne by the recently overhauled No. 3985. The tube was found to have been made of the wrong material during the overhaul in 1996, a discovery that prompted the replacement of the firebox in a complete overhaul that lasted from September 2001 to 2004. On September 9, 2004, the UP steam crew successfully test-fired the 4-8-4. It returned to operating service on November 10, 2004. On May 18‚Äì19, 2007, No. 844 teamed with Southern Pacific 4449 to pull the \\"Puget Sound Excursion\\", a round trip from Tacoma to Everett on BNSF Railway tracks. On June 25 and 26, 2010, it made an excursion trip to Milliken, Colorado's centennial celebration. In September 2012, the locomotive was used in \\"UP 150\\", a celebration of Union Pacific's 150th anniversary celebration, hosted by the California State Railroad Museum. Union Pacific 844 traveling through Cajon Pass in November 2011. UP 844 running through Kansas City, Kansas, on October 15, 2016. Note the absence of the Mars Light: it was removed in 2013. In June 2013, the locomotive's gyrating Mars light, installed in 1946, was removed because its mounting bolts had deteriorated. It was also announced that year that the 844 and 3985 would eventually be joined by a third steam locomotive: Big Boy No. 4014. After the 2013 season, the locomotive was taken out of service for boiler work required by a change in the water treatment. It spent 2014 in Cheyenne, then received an early 15-year inspection the following year. On June 16 and 17, 2016, the 844 was test fired. On July 12, 2016, the Union Pacific Steam Team took the locomotive on a \\"break-in run\\" as a sort of all-systems check and dress rehearsal for its return to service. The run was described as a complete success. On July 23, 2016, it pulled the annual Cheyenne Frontiers Day excursion. On October 13, 2016, the Union Pacific Steam Team started its 18-day \\"Trek To Tennessee\\" journey, the restored 844's first major trip. In April 2017, No. 844 made its first run on the Oregon Short Line Railroad to celebrate the 92nd anniversary of the Boise Union Pacific Depot. Because of heavy snows and a wet spring, the trip was cut short and the engine had to run light across the Malad River because of a washed-out bridge. In December 2018, Union Pacific requested Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) waivers to exempt UP Nos. 844, 3985 and 4014 from federal Positive Train Control (PTC) requirements in February 2019, the FRA officials responded that such waivers were not needed. On May 4, 2019, No. 844 participated in the inaugural run of the newly-restored Big Boy No. 4014. The train departed the historic Cheyenne Depot following a christening ceremony for No. 4014. The two locomotives arrived at the Ogden Union Station on May 9 for the city's Heritage Festival. The two locomotives were on display at the station until May 12, when the return trip to Cheyenne began. They arrived at Cheyenne on May 19, concluding the first run of No. 4014 in excursion service. As of January 2020, the 844 and 4014 are the only two operational UP steam locomotives left on the roster, following the retirement of the 3985 from excursion service due to its poor condition. =Union Pacific \\"8444\\"= Union Pacific No. 8444 running through Donner Pass in April 1981 From 1962 to 1989, the locomotive was numbered UP 8444 because the railroad had given the number 844 to an EMD GP30 locomotive. After the GP30 was retired from active service in June 1989, No. 8444 was renumbered back to 844. Fortunately, the GP30 is now owned by Nevada State Railroad Museum in Boulder City, Nevada, and operates periodically at the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum on excursion runs. There is now an EMD SD70ACe numbered 8444. Accidents and incidents On September 27, 2012, during the \\"UP 150\\" event, No. 844's tender derailed on tightly curved track from the Union Pacific's Martinez Subdivision to the California State Railroad Museum. The tender was returned to the rails at 7:30 p.m. On July 21, 2018, while pulling the Cheyenne Frontier Days Special to Denver, Colorado, No. 844 struck and killed a pedestrian in Henderson, Colorado. The pedestrian, Kelly Yarish, was reportedly trying to take photos of the train while standing too close to the tracks before she was hit. The train was stopped immediately following the accident. Surviving FEF Series locomotives Three other FEF Series locomotives have survived, including FEF-1 No. 814 at Dodge Park in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and FEF-2 No. 833 at the Ogden Union Station Museum in Ogden, Utah, and FEF-3 No. 838 at the steam shops in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Of these three, only 814 and 833 are on static display. 838 remains stored in the Union Pacific steam shops due to its use as a source of spare parts for 844. The surviving centipede tender connected to 844 is No. 23-C-201. Film history UP 844 was documented in the 1981 film \\"Eighty Four Forty Four\\" by the Union Pacific Railroad. Some of those clips would be later used for the opening and closing credits of the PBS show Shining Time Station, which ran from 1989 until 1995 (including the four hour long Family Specials). UP 844 also appears in Extreme Trains in the episode \\"Steam Train\\" in which it pulled the Frontier Days special from Denver to Cheyenne. UP 844 also makes an appearance in the 2nd Episode of the 3rd Season on the TLC TV series, Mostly True Stories?: Urban Legends Revealed. In the 1990 PBS special Ghost Trains of the Old West, UP 8444, as it was numbered at the time of filming, is seen pulling a Union Pacific diesel locomotive and passenger train through Wyoming. UP 844 (and several other restored steam locomotives) appear in the music video with the Pat Metheny Group's \\"Last Train Home\\". The 2014 short film \\"Locomotive Song\\" features UP 844‚Äîparticularly its running gear‚Äîaccompanied by the song of the same name by boogie-woogie pianist Honey Piazza.

Built in July 1943 by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) of Schenectady, New York, No. 3985 is one of only two Union Pacific Challengers left in existence, and the only one to have operated in excursion service. The locomotive operated in revenue service until 1957. It was initially stored at the roundhouse in Cheyenne, Wyoming until 1975, when it was placed outdoors beside the Cheyenne depot. After a group of Union Pacific employees restored the locomotive to running condition in 1981, No. 3985 was placed into excursion service as part of the Union Pacific's heritage fleet and became the largest operational steam locomotive in the world, a title it would hold until the restoration of Union Pacific Big Boy No. 4014 in May 2019. It remained in operation until mechanical problems took it offline in 2010, after which it was stored at the Union Pacific's Steam Shops in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Following No. 4014's restoration, No. 3985 was officially retired from excursion service as a result of its poor condition. Design Designed by UP chief mechanical engineer Otto Jabelmann in 1941, UP 3985 was part of the second order of this second version of the Challenger. The design drew on recent experience with the enormous 4-8-8-4 Big Boy locomotives, and resulted in a locomotive in working order weighing some accompanied by a tender weighing when 2/3 loaded. Calculated tractive effort is . The Challenger class was intended to speed up freight operations on the 0.82% grades across Wyoming; the 1.14% Wasatch Range climb east from Ogden was to be conquered by the Big Boys without helpers. The Challengers and Big Boys arrived on the scene just as traffic was surging in preparation for American participation in World War II. History =Revenue service and retirement (1943-1957)= builder plate UP 3985 was part of the 4664-4 group of Challengers built in 1943. Although this group consisted of 31 locomotives, only 25 went to the Union Pacific. The other six were leased to the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad after completion, where they operated until the Rio Grande sold them to the Clinchfield Railroad in 1947. While the Union Pacific Challengers operated primarily in freight service, a few were assigned to passenger trains. UP 3985 operated in its last \\"revenue\\" train service in 1957. The locomotive was officially retired in 1962 and was stored in the Union Pacific's roundhouse with Big Boy No. 4023 at Cheyenne, Wyoming. In 1975, it was brought out of storage and placed on an outdoor display beside the Cheyenne depot. =Restoration and excursion career (1981-2010)= UP No. 3985 passing through Golconda, Nevada, heading back to Cheyenne, Wyoming in July 1992 No. 3985 westbound through Sloat, California in September 2005 Beginning in 1979, a group of Union Pacific employee-volunteers started work on restoring the locomotive, and it was returned to operational condition in April 1981. The locomotive made its first run during Railfair 1981, where it attended the opening of the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, along with Union Pacific 844, which had been in excursion service since 1960. Originally built to burn coal, it was successfully converted to burn No. 5 fuel oil in 1990. In 1991, No. 3985 went to Railfair '91 along with 844 and DDA40X No. 6936. The excursion also included UP 4-6-0 No. 1243 on a flatbed. The next year, the 3985 went to the National Railroad Historical Society's convention in San Jose, California. It participated in activities along with Southern Pacific 4-8-4 No. 4449 and SP 4-6-2 No. 2472. In May 1994, No. 3985 pulled an excursion on California's Cajon Pass with the Union Pacific's A-B-A set of E9 units during its 1994 tour. In 1999, the 3985 double-headed with No. 844 on the way to Railfair 1999.. After the event, the 3985 was forced to pull the return trip with the 844 dead in tow after the FEF-3 suffered a tube failure on June 24 while on display. The locomotive has pulled many excursion trains in three alternate identities during its career. In November 1992, No. 3985 was chosen to pull the Clinchfield Santa Train as Clinchfield Railroad No. 676, the number chosen as a continuation of the CRR's E-3 locomotives, which were numbered 670‚Äì675. In May 1993, the locomotive masqueraded as sister engine No. 3967 as part of the 40th anniversary of the Rocky Mountain Railroad Club excursion, in which the original 3967, which was scrapped in 1960, pulled the same excursion on May 17, 1953. During the same time period, the engine was renumbered again to 3718, the number being a continuation of the few 4664-4 locomotives that were converted to run on oil in 1945, which were numbered 3708‚Äì3717. Stationed at Cheyenne, Wyoming with other equipment in the UP's heritage collection, it was used for excursion trains and occasionally mainline freight on ferry moves. The most notable freight run of No. 3985 took place in 1990, in which American President Lines had a special request for the locomotive to pull a 143-car doublestack train between Cheyenne, Wyoming and North Platte, Nebraska. It was in the maintenance shop at Cheyenne in 2007 and underwent necessary repairs for service in 2008. The locomotive made its last runs during the Missouri River Eagle Tour, which took place from September 30 to October 14, 2010. As part of the tour, No. 3985 was selected to pull the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus train from Cheyenne to Denver, Colorado, where the circus held a special performance to celebrate P.T. Barnum's birthday. Following the conclusion of the tour, it was taken out service for repairs and placed into storage. =Retirement from excursion service= In December 2018, Union Pacific requested from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) waivers to exempt Nos. 3985, 844 and 4014 from federal Positive Train Control (PTC) requirements; in February 2019, the FRA officials responded that such waivers were not needed. In January 2020, Union Pacific officially retired No. 3985 from excursion service, as the railroad felt they could only maintain and operate two historic steam locomotives at a time (Nos. 4014 and 844), in addition to the locomotive requiring a full rebuild as a result of poor mechanical condition. No further information about the future of the locomotive has been released and the 3985 continues to remain stored at the Union Pacific roundhouse in Cheyenne, Wyoming as of September 2020.

It occurs in wet, fire- free areas at high altitude in eastern Australia. The Antarctic Beech group (Nothofagaceae) is an ancient type of tree, of significance to southern hemisphere botanical distribution. Plants in the Nothofagaceae are currently found in southern South America (Chile, Argentina) and Australasia (east and southeast Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and New Caledonia).Veblen, Thomas; Hill, Robert; Read, Jennifer (1996). Ecology and Biogeography of Nothofagus Forests. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. . Taxonomy Ferdinand von Mueller described the Antarctic beech in 1866, from material collected near the Bellinger River by Charles Moore. Once referred to as 'negrohead beech', but now as 'Antarctic beech' (not to be confused with its South American relative, Nothofagus antarctica) is an evergreen tree native to the eastern highlands of Australia. N. moorei proposed to be renamed Lophozonia moorei in 2013. The change in name from Nothofagus to Lophozonia is controversial.Hill, R.S.; Jordan, G.J.; Macphail, M.K. 2015: Why we should retain Nothofagus sensu lato. Australian systematic botany, 28(3): 190-193. doi:10.1071/SB15026 Within the genus, it is part of a lineage of three evergreen species, the other two being silver beech (N. menziesii) of New Zealand and myrtle beech (N. cunninghamii) of Tasmania and Victoria. Description These trees typically grow to 25 m (80 ft) tall and have large trunks to 1 m in diameter with scaly, dark brown bark. Maximum height is about 50 m. The leaves are simple and alternate, growing six centimeters long. The leaf color is dark green, with new growth brilliant red, or orange in spring. The tree is deciduous in its native environment, but only partially deciduous in warmer areas, dropping half its leaves in autumn. The leaves are triangular to oblong with fine teeth along the crenate edges. The plants have separate male and female flowers that occur on the same tree. The flowers are small and form inconspicuous clusters near the leaves towards the end of the branches. The fruit, produced from December to February, is a small woody structure of four prickly valves. Each fruit contains three small winged nuts. Complicated root structures are frequently exhibited. These roots would once have been soil-covered, but have been exposed over the ages by erosion, and covered in moss and lichen. Many of the trees have multiple trunks emanating from a crown, formed by this root structure. Fires are detrimental to the survival of the Antarctic Beech which, unlike many other Australian plants, is slow to recover from fire. Distribution and habitat Large Antarctic beech at Cobark Park, Barrington Tops, 50 metres tall The Antarctic beech grows in cool temperate rainforests from the Barrington Tops plateau in New South Wales, north to the Lamington Plateau and Springbrook Plateau, in southern Queensland, between altitudes of 480 m and 1550 m. It occurs in temperate to cool temperatures and with occasional snowfalls. Antarctic beech achieves its finest development at Werrikimbe National Park and Mount Banda Banda.New South Wales Rainforests - The Nomination for the World Heritage List. Paul Adam. 1987. =Comboyne= There are four known populations of the Antarctic Beech in the Comboyne area of New South Wales. In 1925, the botanist E.C. Chisholm wrote that the Antarctic Beech at Comboyne was \\"extremely rare, although many trees were undoubtedly destroyed during clearing.\\" The Comboyne Plateau was mostly cleared between 1900 and 1925. The Comboyne plateau is a scarp-bounded paleoplain located between the Mid North Coast of New South Wales and the Great Dividing Range. Miocene basalts overlie much of the plateau, creating relatively fertile red/brown soils. In the southern third of the plateau are underlying Triassic sediments of the Lorne basin. The plateau has a wet, sub tropical climate, though subject to frost and occasional snow. The population at Comboyne was considered likely to be extinct by the scientific community, until published in 1994 by the botanists Bale & Williams. This community of trees regenerates well from seed and is notably vagile, with many young plants. It is the only other lowland (as low as 570 metres) population known, with those found near Dorrigo, to the north. The rainforest botanist Alexander Floyd considers the Comboyne examples of the Antarctic Beech, as part of the cool temperate sub type 49, of the rainforests of New South Wales. History Antarctic beech at Mount Banda Banda Many individuals are extremely old, some about 12,000 years.http://oltw.blogspot.com.au/2011/12/12000-year-old- antarctic-beech.html And at one time it was believed that the Eastern Australian populations could not reproduce in present-day conditions, except by suckering (asexual reproduction), being remnant forest from a cooler time. It has since been shown that sexual reproduction may occur, but distribution in cool, isolated high-altitude environments at temperate and tropical latitudes is consistent with the theory that the species was more prolific in a cooler age.Observations on Nothofagus in New Caledonia. John Dawson. The pattern of distribution around the southern Pacific Ocean rim has fed speculation that the dissemination of the genus dates to the time when Antarctica, Australia and South America were connected, the theoretical common land-mass referred to as Gondwana.

She was awarded the Spinoza Prize in 2002. Research Goulmy did groundbreaking research on the role of antigens in organ and stem cell transplantation. She is the pioneer of the so-called Minor Transplantation Antigens in men. Minor antigens can induce strong immune reactions. She discovered the H-Y minor antigen encoded by the Y-chromosome (1976) and the autosomally encoded HA-1 antigen (1983). She then described the polymorphism and the population frequencies of several autosomal minor antigens. Crucial was her work on the differential expression of minor antigens showing either overall expression on all body cells, such as the male specific H-Y antigens, or restricted expression on solely blood and blood cancer cells, such as HA-1. Goulmy was the first to describe the chemical structure of the human minor antigens (1995). In 1996 she demonstrated the crucial role of minor antigens in the outcome of organ and stem cell transplantation. In 1997 she launched new concepts for immunotherapy of blood cancer applying the blood and cancer cell specific minor antigens, such as HA-1, for tumor specific treatment. The basis for the translation ‚Äòfrom the lab to the clinic‚Äô of these cancer and patient specific treatment was laid in her laboratory. Hereby minor antigens, such as HA-1, are used as ‚Äòvaccin‚Äô to boost the anti-blood cancer reaction in the patients' body. Career Els Goulmy has a remarkable career. After secondary school and an education for laboratory technician, she worked as a clinical-chemical technician in Nijmegen, Switzerland and Norway. In 1972 she started as research technician at the University Hospital in Leiden in the department of Jon van Rood.

Fur is one of the oldest forms of clothing, and is thought to have been widely used as hominids first expanded outside Africa. Some view fur as luxurious and warm; others reject it due to moral concerns for animal rights. The term 'fur' is often used to refer to a coat, wrap, or shawl made from the fur of animals. Controversy exists regarding the wearing of fur coats, due to animal cruelty concerns. The most popular kinds of fur in the 1960s (known as the luxury fur) were blond mink, silver striped fox and red fox. Cheaper alternatives were pelts of wolf, Persian lamb or muskrat. It was common for ladies to wear a matching hat. In the 1950s, a must-have type of fur was the mutation fur (naturally nuanced colours) and fur trimmings on a coat that were beaver, lamb fur, Astrakhan and mink. History  Wholesale dealer (Leipzig, c. 1900) Fur sewing machine Success from Allbook & Hashfield, Nottingham, England Fur is generally thought to have been among the first materials used for clothing and bodily decoration. The exact date when fur was first used in clothing is debated. It is known that several species of hominoids including Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis used fur clothing. Fur clothing predates written history and has been recovered from various archaeological sites worldwide. Crown proclamations known as \\"sumptuary legislation\\" were issued in England limiting the wearing of certain furs to the higher social statuses, thereby establishing a cachet based on exclusivity. Furs such as marten, grey squirrel and ermine were reserved for the aristocracy, while fox, hare and beaver clothed the middle, and goat, wolf and sheepskin the lower. Fur was primarily used for visible linings, with species varied by season within social classes. Furbearing animals decreased in West Europe and began to be imported from the Middle East and Russia. As new kinds of fur entered Europe, other uses were made with fur other than clothing. Beaver was most desired but used to make hats which became a popular headpiece especially during wartime. Swedish soldiers wore broad-brimmed hats made exclusively from beaver felt. Due to the limitations of beaver fur, hat- makers relied heavily on North America for imports as beaver was only available in the Scandinavian peninsula. Other than the military, fur has been used for accessories such as hats, hoods, scarves, and muffs. Design elements including the visuals of the animal were considered acceptable with heads, tails and paws still being kept on the accessories. During the nineteenth century, Seal and karakul were made into indoor jackets. The twentieth century was the beginning of the fur coats being fashionable in West Europe with full fur coats. With lifestyle changes as a result of developments like indoor heating, the international textile trade affected how fur was distributed around the world. Europeans focused on using local resources giving fur association with femininity with the increasing use of mink. In 1970, Germany was the world's largest fur market. The International Fur Trade Federation banned endangering species furs like silk monkey, ocelot, leopard, tiger, and polar bear in 1975. The use of animal skins were brought to light during the 1980s by animal right organisations and the demand for fur decreased. Anti-fur organisations raised awareness of the controversy between animal welfare and fashion. Fur farming became banned in Britain in 1999. During the twenty-first century, fox and mink have been bred in captivity with Denmark, Holland and Finland being leaders of mink production. Fur is still worn in most mild and cool climates around the world due to its warmth and durability. From the days of early European settlement, up until the development of modern clothing alternatives, fur clothing was popular in Canada during the cold winters. The invention of inexpensive synthetic textiles for insulating clothing led to fur clothing falling out of fashion. Fur is still used by indigenous people and developed societies, due to its availability and superior insulation properties. The Inuit peoples of the Arctic relied on fur for most of their clothing, and it also forms a part of traditional clothing in Russia, Ukraine, the former Yugoslavia, Scandinavia, and Japan. It is also sometimes associated with glamour and lavish spending. A number of consumers and designers‚Äînotably British fashion designer and outspoken animal rights activist Stella McCartney‚Äîreject fur due to moral beliefs and cruelty to animals.\\"Fur-Free Designers and Retailers\\" July 31, 2009. Animal furs used in garments and trim may be dyed bright colors or with patterns, often to mimic exotic animal pelts: alternatively they may be left their original pattern and color. Fur may be shorn down to imitate the feel of velvet, creating a fabric called shearling. Intro of alternatives in the early 20th century brought tension to clothing industry as the faux fur manufacturers started producing faux fur and capitalising on profits. By 1950s synthetic fur garments had become popular and affordable. Newspapers were writing articles on major chemical companies trying to outdo each other in the quest to create the most realistic fake fur.Burberry Stops Destroying Product and Bans Real Fur.

Other high end brands to follow this lead are Stella McCartney, Givenchy, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini. Burberry announced to stop sending models with fur on runways but did not stop selling it in stores. There are many companies coming up with more sustainable ways of producing leather and fur. Designer Ingar Helgason is developing Bio fur which would grows synthetic pelts the way that Modern Meadow has been able to produce grown leather and Diamond foundry created lab grown diamonds.

Some of these are more highly prized than others, and there are many grades and colors.

The chemical treatment of fur to increase its felting quality is known as carroting, as the process tends to turn the tips of the fur orange. A furrier is a person who makes fur products such as fur garments, fur blankets etc. and repairs, alters, cleans, or otherwise deals in furs of animals.

Fur clothing has become the focus of boycotts due to the opinion that it is cruel and unnecessary. PETA and other animal rights organizations, celebrities, and animal rights ethicists, have called attention to fur farming. Animal rights advocates object to the trapping and killing of wildlife, and to the confinement and killing of animals on fur farms due to concerns about the animals suffering and death. They may also condemn \\"alternatives\\" made from synthetic (oil-based) clothing as they promote fur for the sake of fashion. Protests also include objection to the use of leather in clothing, shoes and accessories. Some animal rights activists have disrupted fur fashion shows with protests, while other anti-fur protesters may use fashion shows featuring faux furs or other alternatives to fur clothing as a platform to highlight animal suffering from the use of real leathers and furs. These groups sponsor \\"Compassionate Fashion Day\\" on the third Saturday of August to promote their anti-fur message. Some American groups participate in \\"Fur Free Friday\\", an event held annually on the Friday after Thanksgiving (Black Friday) that uses displays, protests, and other methods to highlight their beliefs regarding furs. In Canada, opposition to the annual seal hunt is viewed as an anti-fur issue, although the Humane Society of the United States claims that its opposition is to \\"the largest slaughter of marine mammals on Earth.\\" IFAW, an anti-sealing group, claims that Canada has an \\"abysmal record of enforcement\\" of anti-cruelty laws surrounding the hunt. A Canadian government survey indicated that two-thirds of Canadians supported the hunting of seals if the regulations under Canadian law.

The feeling of outrage against animal suffering is particularly intense when cats and dogs are involved, since these are the most popular pets in Western countries. Therefore, consumers demand to be assured about the production of furs, in order to avoid the risk of inadvertently buying products made with fur from these animals. To counteract the growing concern of consumers, European Union officially banned the import and export from all Member States of dog and cat furs, and all products containing fur from these species, with the Regulation 1523/2007,European Parliament. 2007.

It breeds from Costa Rica through South America south to Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. Description Country Inn - Panama City, Panama The southern beardless tyrannulet is long, weighs and often resembles a tiny yellow-bellied elaenia. The head is dark brown or grey with an erectile crest and pale supercilium. The upperparts are grey-green becoming paler on the rump. The wings are brown with yellow feather-edging and two whitish, yellowish or cinnamon wing bars. The tail, which regularly is held cocked, is brown, the throat grey, the breast yellowish, and the abdomen yellow. The bill is black, but at least the base of the lower mandible is pale. Subspecies from humid regions (e.g. the Amazon basin) are generally greener with pure yellow bellies, while subspecies of drier regions (e.g. eastern Brazil and western Ecuador) generally are greyer with duller bellies. The subspecies C. o. venezuelae occurs only in Trinidad and Venezuela, and is well distinct in plumage tone. The call is a loud whistled '. In courtship, the crests are raised, the tail flicked, and an excited mixture of the ' call and a churring ' is given. Sexes are similar, and this species always appears brighter, especially with regard to the wing bars, than the closely related northern beardless tyrannulet (C. imberbe), with which it was once considered conspecific. However, the two forms overlap without interbreeding in central Costa Rica. Ecology This species is found in light forests, cultivation, gardens with trees and dry cerrado savanna. Southern beardless tyrannulets are active birds, feeding in a vireo- or warbler-like fashion on insects, spiders and berries. Animal prey is either picked out of the air or off plants with a dedicated sally flight, or gleaned from vegetation.de A. Gabriel & Pizo (2005) Fruit, e.g. from Alchornea glandulosa, are typically picked off when perched or during hovering flight.Pascotto (2006) This species will readily mob small predators like the ferruginous pygmy owl (Glaucidium brasilianum). It tends to keep on its own except during the breeding season, and rarely joins mixed- species feeding flocks.Ragusa-Netto (2000) The domed nest is made of plant fibre or leaves with a side entrance. The nest is placed by a tree fork, usually near a wasp nest, which presumably provides some protection from predators. The typical clutch is two white eggs, which are marked with rufous and lilac mostly at the larger end. Incubation by the female is 14‚Äì15 days to hatching, with another 17 days to fledging. As it ranges so widely, this bird is considered a species of least concern by the IUCN.BLI (2008) Notes References * de A. Gabriel, Vagner & Pizo, Marco A.

It is a unit of the Bibb County Public School System. History =Early history= Before the Civil War, the Bibb County Academy was operated as a public school; a county poor student fund paid the tuition for students unable to pay. In 1870, when Georgia established a true public school system, the Bibb County Board of Education and Orphanage was established to operate a school system for the county. The new board created grammar schools in each ward of the city and The Central High School. The name was changed to Gresham High in the late 1880s, and the school remained open until 1913. The building later served as Gresham Grammar School. =Lanier and Miller= In 1913, the county opened Lanier High School on Forsyth Street, named for poet and Macon native Sidney Lanier. The school split in 1924 into separate schools for boys and girls, with the boys moving to a campus on Holt Avenue, and the girls remaining on Forsyth Street. In 1949, Lanier added a junior high school on Hendley Street. alt=Photo of a two-story brick school building with boarded up windows. In 1932, Bibb County opened A.L. Miller Senior High School for Girls, named for Alexander Lawton Miller, on Montpelier Avenue, blocks from Lanier's Holt campus. The original Forsyth Street campus continued to house a junior high school for girls until February 1950, when Miller Junior High School opened next door to Miller Senior High School. The Lanier Poets won numerous state athletic titles, and became a basketball powerhouse. The school's JROTC program received national honors. 1958 marked a major change for public education in Bibb County, as Willingham and McEvoy High Schools opened for boys and girls, respectively, meaning that for the first time, white students in Bibb County were divided by attendance zones. =Fire and integration= In April 1967, fire destroyed most of the Lanier Senior campus on Holt Avenue. Over the next several years, the school was rebuilt while the senior and middle high schools shared the Hendley Street campus. The new building, opened in December 1968, sat on the former site of Lanier Senior, though it faced Napier Avenue, with side entrances from Holt. Some buildings not destroyed by the fire were incorporated into the new school, including the Vocational Building, JROTC Complex, and \\"Old Gym\\" portions of Central High School. The last of those buildings was demolished in 2009 to make way for new Central High School buildings. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Bibb County's schools faced court-ordered integration. The four schools named Lanier and Miller merged to create the Central High School Complex. This fit with Bibb County's new pattern of creating high school-middle school complexes with directional names. Other school complexes created by the mergers included Northeast and Southwest, the latter of which later spun off a new school named Southeast. In the case of Central, the recently built Lanier Senior building on Napier became known as \\"Lanier B\\", while the junior high on Hendley was renamed \\"Lanier A;\\" the two shared duty as Central High School. The former Miller Junior High School for Girls became Miller A Jr. High, with the old Miller Senior becoming Miller B Jr. High. They were twin junior high schools, both of them housing both 8th and 9th graders, and serving as the feeder schools to Central, which then housed grades ten, eleven, and twelve. In the 1984-85 school year, the ninth grade was moved to the senior high school, and the two junior high schools became Miller Middle School, with the seventh grade (moved up from the elementary schools) housed in one building and the eighth grade housed in the other. For the early years of Central, about 1970 to 1975, students remained mostly segregated by sex, with the girls at Lanier A and the boys at Lanier B, with each complex retaining the principals of the girls' and boys' schools. Eventually, girls were allowed to take some courses on the boys' campus (such as physics or German, courses not taught on the girls' campus). Finally, girls and boys were completely integrated in the courses, although their supervisions (homerooms) remained sex-segregated until 1981. By the 1980s, these vestiges of sex-segregation were completely eliminated. Lanier A ultimately housed mostly ninth-grade supervisions, while the upperclassmen were primarily in Lanier B; this arrangement persisted until Lanier A was torn down in 1997. Following the mergers in 1970, many expressed anger at the outcome; school names, the end of racial/sex segregation, colors, and mascots that had existed for decades were lost and replaced with new, directional names. Lanier ceased to exist. One development of Bibb County's reorganization of the school district was that the county gained many new private schools. Not all survive, but to this day, Macon has a far larger private school population than similar-sized cities in Georgia (such as Augusta, Columbus, or Savannah). =Central High School= Current Central football helmet design Central High emerged in 1970 as a new school straddling both sides of Hendley Street. Its sports teams were called the Chargers, and it adopted the colors orange (which, along with green, had been Lanier's) and white (blue was added by Coach Simonton in the early 1980s). Both Miller and Central were larger than many middle and high schools at the time (though the Southwest complex was much larger), and faced numerous hardships due to this fact. =1990s and beyond= In 1992, Central began offering courses in preparation for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB) curriculum; the first exams were given in May 1996. The school began the program as a county-wide magnet program under the guidance of principal Leontine Espy and IB coordinator Elizabeth Hinesley. While the IB program at Central started small, it has grown over the years, and now generally admits 40-60 students as freshmen. Typically, 50-75% of those students remain in the program and sit for examinations at the end of senior year. About half earn the IB diploma while the remainder receive certificates of performance. Both groups often exempt significant college coursework. Central underwent a major change in 1997 when Westside High and H.G. Weaver Middle opened on Heath Road in the western portion of the county. Many of the higher-income areas that had been in the Miller/Central zone were moved to the new schools, along with parts of the Southwest zone. Westside immediately became the county's largest high school, and the corresponding decrease in enrollment that had been planned for Central meant that the Lanier A building (dating from 1948) would be demolished and replaced with a new Miller Middle School, closer to Central. The new school opened in the fall of 1997. Despite the loss of so many students to Westside, the existence of the IB, Fine Arts, and JROTC magnet programs continued to draw many students to Central. At the same time, Miller Middle added a core knowledge/cultural literacy magnet program, and created a feeder for Central's magnet programs. Just as they had fifty years before, students from anywhere in Bibb County could attend Miller and Central. The present and future Central continues to draw students from across Bibb County. Enrollment numbers have challenged the limits of the former Lanier B building, which shows signs of its age ‚Äî it has scarcely been renovated since the late 1960s, and some additional outbuildings date from the original 1920s facility. A new Central, possibly including a controversial merger with Southwest, was proposed in a 1998 bond issue and a resulting 1999 SPLOST (special purpose local sales tax), but was never built due to other priorities. An ELOST (educational local option sales tax) passed in September 2005 and had both a new Central and Southwest listed as priorities, as well as a new high school in north Bibb County attached to the newly opened Howard Middle School that is also expected to draw many top students. On October 30, 2007, a ceremonial groundbreaking was held for the new Central High building, to be constructed on a cleared property across Blackmon Avenue (now closed) from the current location. The new school opened in August 2009 with capacity for 1,000 students. The old building was razed and is now a park. Traditions and accomplishments *Central High School, under counselor Dorothy Krak√≥w, is establishing a tradition of winning Gates Millennium Scholarships from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2016, seniors Tamia Middleton and Ira Moore were selected in the final cohort of the Gates Millennium Scholars Program. In 2015, senior Nicole Wiggins was named a Gates Millennium scholar; in 2014, graduating senior Joseph Lofton was named a Gates Millennium scholar; in April 2013, three Central students (Kenya Andrews, Christine Okaro and Ashley Washington) were named; In 2011, Thelron Pleas was named. Only 1000 such students are named nationwide each year. *The Central High School Orchestra directed by Patricia McCall performs around Macon and also performs annually at the state capital. The orchestra is a perennial \\"Superior\\" scorer at Georgia's State Festival. The CHS trio (2005‚Äì2008) grew popular around Macon, performed around the state, and helped to promote the fine arts program. *Central's Sugarbear Band performs at football games as well as in concerts, typically receiving \\"Superior\\" rankings at festivals across the state.

It is assigned to the Eighteenth Air Force of Air Mobility Command and is active duty host wing on McChord. The wing is composed of more than 2,200 active duty military and civilian personnel. It is tasked with supporting worldwide combat and humanitarian airlift contingencies. Aircraft of the 62nd fly around the world, conducting airdrop training; it also carries out the Antarctic resupply missions.

It owes its numerical designation, and its first seven years of history prior to 1947, to the present day 62d Operations Group. =Cold War= Since the wing was established in 1947 it conducted troop carrier operations, tactical exercises, and humanitarian missions. The wing trained at McChord Air Force Base, Washington until late 1951 when it moved to Larson Air Force Base. From Larson the wing routinely performed troop carrier, air transport, and humanitarian missions on a global scale: fling mail to Japan for U.S. troops in Korea in 1952; bringing medical supplies to the flooded areas of Pakistan in 1954; and transporting French troops and equipment from France to Indochina as part of Operation Bali-Hai from April‚ÄìMay 1954. The wing airlifted radar equipment and supplies for the construction of the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line in northern Alaska and Canada from, 1955‚Äì1956, and thereafter periodically resupplied DEW stations. During the International Geophysical Year 1957-1958, and subsequently through 1962 the wing supported scientific stations in the Arctic Ocean by airlanding and airdropping supplies on the drifting ice. It helped transport United Nations troops and supplies to the Congo in 1960 (\\"Operation New Tape\\").Daniel L. Haulman in In 1963 the wing assumed responsibility for worldwide airlift of nuclear weapons and associated equipment, continuing this mission through early 1971. It also assumed airlift of Minuteman missiles from depots to operating sites in April 1971. In 1972 it supported Presidential trips to China and the Soviet Union. From 12 February to 1 April 1973 the wing transported former prisoners of war from North Vietnam to the Philippines and the United States. That same year it transported United Nations troops from Indonesia to Israel and Egypt as part of a peacekeeping effort. C-124, C-130, and C-141 with Mount Saint Helens in the background In the summer of 1975, the wing assumed control of the 36th Tactical Airlift Squadron (36 TAS) and their C-130E aircraft, which transferred from Langley AFB, Virginia following the transfer of all Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft from Tactical Air Command (TAC) to Military Airlift Command (MAC), and the disestablishment of the 316th Tactical Airlift Wing at Langley to make way for the arrival of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing (1 TFW) and their F-15A and F-15B aircraft. From October 1975 to October 1977, the 62 MAW maintained a detachment of C-130Es in the Panama Canal Zone to support USAF needs in Central and South America. The 62nd airlifted troops and supplies during invasion of Grenada and airlifted university students to safety from, October‚ÄìNovember 1983. During 1988 62 AW aircraft were used to transport inspectors to the Soviet Union under terms of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. 62 AW aircraft were also used that year to transport firefighters and supplies to Wyoming to fight major forest fires in Yellowstone National Park. It participated in the airdrop of heavy equipment and personnel during military action in Panama, 20 December 1989. During Operation Desert Shield the 62nd airlifted personnel and equipment to Southwest Asia and operated airlift control elements at Zaragoza, Spain, to direct cargo and personnel destined for Southwest Asia from, August 1990-March 1991. Additionally, during 1991, 62 AW personnel and aircraft facilitated the evacuation of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station following the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines. In addition, some activities of the 62nd Military Airlift Wing did not take place at McChord AFB. For instance, one unit that belonged to the 62nd MAW‚Äîthe 602 Military Airlift Support Squadron (MASS) -- was assigned to Elmendorf Air Force Base during the rapid buildup of forces in Vietnam. The 602 MASS supported the flights of C-141 and C-130 aircraft from bases in the continental USA along the great circle route to Japan and Southeast Asia (SEA) by providing refueling services and basic mechanical maintenance for aircraft while en route to and from SEA. The 602 MASS was in operation at Elmendorf around the mid-1960s to about the end of America's involvement in Vietnam. =End of the Century= Inspectors of the Joint Southern Control Board reviewing activities of a large, temporarily resident grey metal object In 1992, 62 AW flew relief mission to Guam following Typhoon Omar, Hawaii following Hurricane Iniki, Florida following Hurricane Andrew, as well as Somalia, the former Yugoslavia, and the former Soviet Union. In 1993, the 62 AW divested itself of the then- redesignated 36th Airlift Squadron (36 AS), transferring the squadron and its C-130E aircraft to the 374th Airlift Wing (374 AW) at Yokota AB, Japan. In 1994, the 62 AW dispatched personnel and aircraft to deliver equipment and supplies in support of Operation Support Hope in Rwanda. During 1995, the 62 AW deployed personnel and aircraft to the U.S. Virgin Islands following Hurricane Marilyn and to Bosnia in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. 62 AW personnel delivered relief supplies to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam following torrential following spawned by Typhoon Linda in 1997. In 1998, the 62 AW delivered relief supplies to Guam following Super Typhoon Paka, to Papua New Guinea following a tsunami, to Changsha, China following severe flooding, and to Nairobi, Kenya following the bombing of the U.S. Embassy there. =Recent activities= Following the September 11 attacks the 62 AW has been flying missions in support of the Global War on Terror, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Nobel Eagle, and Operation Infinite Justice. In 2003 the 62 AW assisted in the troop buildup leading up to Operation Iraqi Freedom and conducted the airdrop of the 173rd Airborne Brigade into northern Iraq at the onset of the war. In late 2004 and early 2005 the 62 AW was dispatched with emergency relief supplies to areas throughout Southeast Asia in response to the tsunami that struck on 26 December 2004. On May 8th, 2020, the 62 AW saluted the healthcare workers at the forefront in the fight against COVID-19 by performing a 2.5 hour C-17 Globemaster III two-ship formation flyover throughout Washington State's Puget Sound Region. =2009 Air Mobility Rodeo= In 2009 the 62 AW won the Best Air Mobility Wing at the Air Mobility Rodeo, a biennial, international airlift competition hosted by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command. In addition to taking the top prize, the 62 AW also won Best C-17 Team and Best Airdrop Team. Beyond the major awards, sub-category awards won include Best Aerial Port Challenge Course Team, Best Joint Inspection Team, Best C-17 Low-level Airdrop Crew, Best C-17 Aircrew, and Best C-17 Post-flight Team. =Lineage= * Established as 62nd Troop Carrier Wing on 28 July 1947 : Organized on 15 August 1947 : Redesignated: 62nd Troop Carrier Wing, Medium, on 22 August 1948 : Redesignated: 62nd Troop Carrier Wing, Heavy, on 12 October 1949 : Inactivated on 1 June 1950 * Activated on 17 September 1951 : Redesignated: 62nd Air Transport Wing, Heavy, on 1 January 1965 : Redesignated: 62nd Military Airlift Wing on 8 January 1966 : Redesignated: 62d Airlift Wing on 1 December 1991. * Designated 62d Air Expeditionary Wing in September 2001 when wing elements deployed to combat areas. =Assignments= * Twelfth Air Force, 15 August 1947 * Fourth Air Force, 10 December 1948 ‚Äì 1 June 1950 * Eighteenth Air Force, 17 September 1951 * Twenty-Second Air Force, 1 July 1957 * Fifteenth Air Force, 1 July 1993 * Eighteenth Air Force, 1 October 2003‚Äìpresent * Air Mobility Command when wing elements deployed to combat areas any time after 11 September 2001. =Components= Wings * 302d Troop Carrier Wing: attached 27 June 1949 ‚Äì 5 May 1950 Groups * 61st Troop Carrier Group: attached 21 November 1952 ‚Äì 24 August 1954 * 62nd Troop Carrier (later, 62 Operations) Group: 15 August 1947 ‚Äì 1 June 1950 (detached 2 May-1 June 1950); 1 October 1951-15 January 1960; 1 December 1991‚Äìpresent Squadrons * 4th Troop Carrier (later, 4 Air Transport; 4 Military Airlift; 4 Airlift) Squadron: attached 8‚Äì14 January 1960, assigned 15 January 1960-1 December 1991 * 7th Troop Carrier (later, 7 Air Transport; 7 Military Airlift) Squadron: attached 8‚Äì14 January 1960, assigned 15 January 1960-22 December 1969 * 8th Troop Carrier (later, 8 Air Transport; 8 Military Airlift) Squadron: attached 8‚Äì14 January 1960, assigned 15 January 1960-1 December 1991. * 10th Airlift Squadron: 1 October 2003 - 6 December 2016 * 19th Air Transport (later 19th Military Airlift) Squadron: 1 July 1963 ‚Äì 22 December 1969 * 28th Air Transport (later 28th Military Airlift) Squadron: 1 July 1963 ‚Äì 22 December 1969 * 36th Tactical Airlift (later, 36 Military Airlift) Squadron: 1 July 1975 ‚Äì 1 December 1991. =Stations= * McChord Field (later, McChord AFB), Washington, 15 August 1947 ‚Äì 1 June 1950; 17 September 1951 * Larson AFB, Washington, 21 April 1952 * McChord Air Force Base (Later became part of Joint Base Lewis-McChord), Washington, 13 June 1960‚Äìpresent =Aircraft= * C-82, 1947‚Äì1950 * C-54, 1949‚Äì1950 * C-124, 1951‚Äì1969 * C-54, 1952 * C-141, 1966‚Äì2002 * C-130, 1975‚Äì1989 * C-17, 1999‚Äìpresent =Operations= *Operation Deep Freeze *Operation Iraqi Freedom *Operation Enduring Freedom *Joint Task Force Katrina *Operation Urgent Fury *Operation Desert Shield *Operation Desert Storm *Operation Just Cause *Operation Support Hope *Operation Joint Endeavor *Operation Noble Eagle *Operation Enduring Freedom *Operation Northern Delay *Operation Unified Assistance Unit shields Image:62d Airlift Wing.png62 AW Image:62 Comptroller Sq.jpg62 CPTS Image:62_OG.jpg62 OG Image:4th Airlift Squadron Emblem.jpg4 AS Image:7 Airlift Sq.jpg7 AS Image:8th Airlift Squadron.jpg8 AS Image:10th Airlift Squadron Badge.svg10 AS Image:62 Operations Support Sq.jpg62 OSS Image:62 Maintenance Gp.jpg62 MXG Image:62 Aircraft Mairnenance Squadron.jpg62 AMXS Image:62 Maintenance Sq.jpg62 MXS Image:62 Logistics Support Sq (later 62 Maintenance Operations s.jpg62 MOS Image:62 Mission Support Gp.jpg62 MSG Image:62 Aerial Port Sq.jpg62 APS Image:62 Civil Engineer Squadron.jpg62 CES Image:62 Comunications Sq.jpg62 CS Image:62 Contracting Sq.jpg62 CONS Image:62 Logistics Readiness Sq.jpg62 LRS Image:62 Mission Support Squadron.jpg62 MSS Image:62 Security Forces Sq.jpg62 SFS Image:62 Medical Gp.jpg62 MDG Image:62 Airlift Wg old & new.jpgHistorical Wing Shields References * Ravenstein, Charles A.

Referred to as the default desert bird, it is a non- migratory species. Several subspecies have been classified since 1827, though there is no consensus on the number. Allopatric speciation is believed to have played a major role in the variations of the curve-billed. It shares striking similarities in appearance with another Toxostoma member, Bendire's thrasher. Nevertheless, it is recognized for its grey color and sickle-shaped bill. It generally resides in desert regions of the United States and Mexico, but can inhabit areas predominately populated by humans. The demeanor of the curve- billed has been described as \\"shy and rather wild\\", but it allows humans to view it closely. It is very aggressive in driving out potential threats, whether competitors for food or predators of its chicks. The curve-billed thrasher sometimes mimicks several other species, though not to the extent of other mimids. It has a variety of distinctive songs, and this extensive repertoire of melodies has led it to be known as cuitiacoache (songbird) in Mexico. Taxonomy and systematics The species was first described as Toxostoma curvirostre by William John Swainson in 1827. Since then, six subspecies have been recognized, and have been divided into two branches. Genetic research has indicated that the curve-billed thrasher is the sister species of a clade consisting of the ocellated thrasher, brown thrasher, long- billed thrasher, and Cozumel thrasher. This contrasts with an earlier suggestion that curve-billed and ocellated thrashers are closest relatives. =Subspecies= Eastern: * T. c. oberholseri (Law, 1928) Brownsville thrasher. Generally ranges from SE Texas to NE Mexico (E Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas). * T. c. curvirostre (Swainson, 1827) Ranges from Central to South-Central Mexico (towards Pueblo, Oaxaca, and Veracruz). * T. c. celsum (R. T. Moore, 1941) plateau thrasher. Range spans from SE Colorado, SW Kansas, extreme NW Oklahoma to S/SE Arizona, S New Mexico and W Texas to Northern Mexico (E Chihuahua to Guanajuato and Jalisco). Atop a cholla cactus in Kingman, Arizona. Western: * T. c. insularum (van Rossem, 1930) San Esteban thrasher. Located in the Islands of San Esteban and Tibur√≥n off the coast of Sonora in the Gulf of California. * T. c. maculatum (Nelson, 1900) spotted thrasher. Found in NW Mexico (S Sonora, N Sinaloa, SW Chihuahua). * T. c. occidentale (Ridgway, 1882) Mazatlan thrasher. Located in Western Mexico (from Sinaloa and Nayarit to Jalisco). * T. c. palmeri (Coues, 1872) Palmer's thrasher. Range is S Arizona, N Sorona and Chihuahua. This species is the representative of the western species, and was suggested to have enough variations to be considered a different species from T.c. curvirostre. T.c. palmeri was also used in a 2009 proposal by the American Ornithologists' Union to be elevated to species status, along with the eastern T.c. curvisrostre representing the eastern curve-billed thrashers. Description Perched in a alt=Bird in a tree The curve-billed thrasher is immediately recognized as a thrasher by its long tail and short wings. It is also recognized for its sickle-shaped bill, almost as long as its head width and brownish black in color. The body is compact with a large head, short wings and long tail. However, the tail is short relative to other thrasher species. The chest is grayish brown with circular brown-gray spots. The eyes are generally orange, shading to golden in adulthood. Juveniles are lacking in pale tips, rectrices, abdominal feathers are unkempt and upper parts and chest are washed rufously. Variations are markedly different with each subspecies. The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest, more white along the tips and retraces and obvious wing bars. T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and less obvious wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri and has more visible spotting on its breast. One study published in 2003 suggested that curve-billed speciation was due to climate, which could be explained by molt and feather wear. The same study suggested that the Sierra Madre Occidental acts as a barrier to initiate differentiation within the species. Measurements: * Length: 10.6-11.0 in (27-28 cm) * Weight: 2.1-3.3 oz (60.8-93.6 g) * Wingspan: 13.4-13.6 in (34-34.5 cm) =Voice and song= The most distinctive voice of the curve- billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. The songs are similar to that of the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another. As a mimid it is capable of mimicking several species, including scissor-tailed flycatcher, northern cardinal, pyrrhuloxia and, in one instance, a black- headed grosbeak. =Similar species= Because its coloration is similar to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the lower mandible, showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature a stark contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed has a tendency to display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, in contrast to the Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have yellow eyes while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers open grassland with scattered yucca or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck, while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls. Some of the aforementioned differences, such as streaks on the breast, bill shape and eye color are even more prominent in juveniles of the two species. Habitat and distribution Curve-billed thrasher perched on a alt=Bird on a cactus The curve-billed thrasher is commonly found throughout the southwestern United States from Arizona's Sonoran Desert across New Mexico to west Texas, southeastern Colorado and southwestern Kansas as well as most of Mexico from the Sonoran-Chihuahuan Deserts and south through the Mexican Plateau into Central Tamaulipas, inland to Oaxaca, and on the coast of Sonora to Nayarit. Vagrants have been found in bordering states of its range, as far north as North Dakota, Alberta and Manitoba and as far east as Florida. Palmeri types have been spotted in Florida, while curvirostre have been found in Iowa on several occasions. Other than previously noted exceptions, the curve-billed is essentially non-vagrant. In comparison with other desert thrashers, the curve-billed is not as particular with habitats and can be found from ground level up to . It generally resides where cholla and saguaro cacti, ocotillo, mesquites, palo verde, and creosote bushes are prevalent. It can also be located along woodland edges, pi√±on, dry desert bushland and areas within its region where cacti are present. If there is an adequate amount of desert vegetation near human habitation, along with feeders, the curve-billed can adapt within these environments. Behavior and ecology The curve-billed thrasher can generally be found running rapidly from cover to cover or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this bird is not shy about being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round- tailed ground squirrel. =Mating= One recorded case of courtship behavior involving curve-billed thrashers describes two males attacking each other vigorously and resorting to purring and hissings sounds when neither bird appeared to relent. The two males then puffed up their chests and strutted up and down in front of the female. They continued to alternate between purr and hiss and fighting one another until one triumphed. The victor flew towards the female and both chirped melodically before copulation. =Breeding= alt=Nest with four blue eggs The curve-billed breeding season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings have been recorded as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, prickly pear or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair. alt=Nest with chicks in a cactus Both sexes build the nest; the building periods can be as brief as three days to as long as four weeks. Egg count differs by location; the number has been as low as two and as high as five. Egg color varies; they can appear bluish green to pale yellowish blue, spotted abundantly in reddish brown. Both sexes incubate but the female is mainly responsible as well as being the sole provider of brooding. Curve-billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings. Curved- billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds. In situations where food is scarce, parents feed older fledglings first. The fledging period ranges from 11 to 18 days. =Feeding= The curve-billed thrasher is an omnivore. Its diet includes invertebrates such as beetles, moths, butterflies, arachnids, and snails. It also eats vegetable matter, and fruits from cacti, prickly pear, hackberries, and anacua, among other plants. The curve-billed has also been spotted eating dog food, and will feed it to their chicks. They are ground feeders, and not well adapting to climbing on branches. Thrashers will take surface prey, but will also dig holes more than deep to search for food. Curve-billeds will also sip nectar from saguaro blossoms and eat insects trapped within, serving as pollinators in the process. They also have great love for the resulting saguaro fruits, which is an important source of water in dry months.:168-187 = Threats = Predators, which mainly focus on young birds, include snakes, coyotes, and roadrunners. This may account for very low brood success in the species, as only 20% of nests are successful in a year.:183-185 Curve-billed thrashers share a very similar range to the cactus wren, as well as a favorite species to nest in: the jumping cholla. Because of this, interspecific conflict is frequent. Fights over food are rare, but fights to protect fledglings are heated. They will vigorously work to destroy each other's nests, although typically only roosting nests, not breeding nests, are destroyed. Despite this, nests of curve-billeds and cactus wrens may still be concurrently and successfully raised even feet away from each other. Anderson & Anderson noted a minimum nest distance of a highly unusual 6 inches (neither nest was destroyed by the either throughout the entire season), although average interspecies nest distances were well over a hundred feet. Nest destruction is almost always unsuccessful, and less intense, during breeding times, as both species adamantly defend their own nests. Once breeding season wanes, and fledglings emerge, competition becomes more fierce.:168-187  Status  The curve-billed thrasher is rated as a species of least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Its population is declining.

With Friedrich Ebert, he co-chaired of the Council of the People's Deputies after the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19. Early life Hugo Haase was born on 29 September 1863 in Allenstein, East Prussia, Germany (now Olsztyn, Poland), the son of Jewish shoemaker and small businessman, Nathan Haase, and his wife Pauline (n√©e Anker). After attending the Gymnasium at Rastenburg, Haase studied law in K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1887 and the next year established himself as a lawyer. He was the first socialist lawyer in East Prussia and took on clients mainly from the lower classes (workers, peasants), journalists and socialist functionaries. In 1894, Haase became the first Social Democrat in the municipal parliament (Stadtverordnetenversammlung) of K√∂nigsberg. In 1897, he was elected to the Reichstag in a by-election. In multiple legal cases, he defended Social Democrats against various politically motivated charges. High-profile cases that made him known throughout the country included the so-called K√∂nigsberger Geheimbundproze√ü in 1904, in which he achieved acquittals for several politicians including the later Minister President of Prussia, Otto Braun. In 1907, Haase was counsel for Karl Liebknecht (SPD) who had been charged with high treason for publishing his screed Militarismus und Antimilitarismus. Haase belonged to the so-called \\"revisionist\\" wing of the party, which in contrast to the Marxists, supported gradual reforms and no longer saw the best path to social and political change in revolution. In 1911, he became SPD chairman along with August Bebel, in 1912 Haase was reelected to the Reichstag and, together with Philipp Scheidemann, became chairman of the SPD Reichstag group. After Bebel's death in 1913, Haase and Friedrich Ebert were chosen as the party chairmen. However, he remained active as a lawyer (now with an office in Berlin). By contrast with Ebert, Bebel and Scheidemann, Haase was not a home-grown party functionary but a radical intellectual. First World War, founding of the USPD In July 1914, he organized the anti-World War I rallies of the SPD and on 31 July and 1 August fought for the SPD to vote in the Reichstag against an increase in war loans. However, he failed to accomplish this due to the opposition of Friedrich Ebert and the faction majority. In the decisive meeting of the SPD delegates on 3 August, only Haase and 13 others refused to support the loans. Bowing to party discipline, Haase then voted for the loans in the Reichstag and, as chairman, had to defend the SPD vote in the session of 4 August. It was Haase who read out the party's statement that \\"we won't abandon the Fatherland in the hour of danger\\", in response to which the imperial government created its so-called Burgfrieden policy. After the collapse of German war plans at the end of 1914, Haase became more and more vocal against the policies of the SPD faction. He was forced to resign as faction leader in 1915. That June, he signed the manifesto Gebot der Stunde which openly opposed the war aims of the government. In March 1916, Haase and 18 other SPD delegates voted against the government's emergency budget. He was forced to resign as party chairman of the SPD. He then founded and led the Sozialdemokratische Arbeitsgemeinschaft. In April 1917, Haase became chairman of the newly founded Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), which split from the so-called \\"Majority Social Democrats\\" group and advocated immediate peace negotiations. USPD Board: Arthur Crispien, Wilhelm Dittmann, Viktor Adler, Richard Lipinski, Wilhelm Bock, Alfred Henke, Eduard Bernstein, Fritz Geyer, Fritz Zubeil, Hugo Haase, Fritz Kunert, Georg Ledebour, Arthur Hagen and Emanuel Wurm Tomb of Hugo Haase in Berlin. German revolution, Council of the People's Deputies and 1919 In the course of the German Revolution in November 1918, along with the majority Social Democrats' leader Ebert, Haase became joint chairman of the provisional government, the Council of the People's Deputies. Haase thus distanced himself from those in the USPD who were seeking to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat through powerful soldiers' and workers' councils. After the Council led by Ebert ordered the bloody suppression of the revolutionary Volksmarinedivision during Christmas 1918, Haase and the two other USPD representatives Wilhelm Dittman and Emil Barth left the government on 29 December in protest. Even then, Haase supported continued cooperation with the SPD and was in favour of elections to the Weimar National Assembly‚Äîboth views not universally popular in his party where many preferred a council-based republic. After the founding of the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (KPD) in late 1918/early 1919, Haase argued in favour of a reunification between USPD and majority SPD. Notwithstanding this position, many in the majority SPD loathed him. This was mainly due to the fact that the USPD's very existence provided a political alternative to the left of the SPD, which was particularly attractive to many workers. In order to retain the support of the revolutionary masses, the SPD leadership thus was forced to steer a more leftist course than they would otherwise have chosen if left to their own devices. It also made their job of feeding the population, keeping up law and order and decommissioning the huge war-time army whilst replacing the Empire with a republic harder by threatening to antagonize the mostly conservative civil service and, in particular, the leadership of the military. The Haase- led USPD only achieved a disappointing 7% of the vote for the National Assembly on 19 January 1919. Death On 8 October 1919, immediately prior to his death Haase was walking into the Reichstag with the intention of exposing an alliance between Ebert and R√ºdiger Von der Goltz, a Freikorps general active in the Baltic. He was shot by Johann Voss as he entered the building. Voss was declared insane within two days and committed to a mental asylum. Some left wing activists suggested that he was a paid assassin. Haase was severely injured and died on 7 November. A memorial meeting held on Saturday 10 November was raided by the Haase is buried on the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde in Berlin. Hugo Haase had been married to Thea (n√©e Lichtenstein) with whom he had a son.

The event caused serious damage to the Greater Mexico City area and the deaths of at least 5,000 people. The sequence of events included a foreshock of magnitude 5.2 that occurred the prior May, the main shock on 19 September, and two large aftershocks. The first of these occurred on 20 September with a magnitude of 7.5 and the second occurred seven months later on 30 April 1986 with a magnitude of 7.0. They were located off the coast along the Middle America Trench, more than away, but the city suffered major damage due to its large magnitude and the ancient lake bed that Mexico City sits on. The event caused between three and four billion USD in damage as 412 buildings collapsed and another 3,124 were seriously damaged in the city. Preface Map showing regional tectonic plates and the Middle America Trench. Much of Mexico's volcanic and seismic activity stems from the movement of the North American plate against the Cocos and Pacific plates and it is one of the most active trenches in the world. Each year more than 90 tremors above magnitude 4.0 are recorded in this zone. While not on or near any fault line like San Francisco or Los Angeles, Mexico City is vulnerable to earthquakes. The main reason for this is the surface geology of the area, especially the downtown area. The city was originally built on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, and Aztec rulers built dikes to prevent flooding while Spanish colonial rulers later drained the lakes in a massive hydraulic project (known as the Desag√ºe) in response to major periodic flooding. The near surface geology of this area is classified into three sections: the old lake bed which is soft clay from volcanic ash with a high water content, a piedmont area, much of which is capped by 5 to 30 meters of lava less than 2,500 years old, and an old river delta area. On the bed of the historic lake, the prevailing silt and volcanic clay sediments amplify seismic shaking. Damage to structures is worsened by soil liquefaction which causes the loss of foundation support and contributes to dramatic settlement of large buildings. Mexico City's downtown area mostly lies on the silt and volcanic clay sediments of the bed of the historic Lake Texcoco, which are between seven and thirty-seven meters deep and have a high water content. Above this is a layer of sand and above this is a layer of sand and rock. The western and northwestern parts of the city are outside the old lakeshores and are located on sands from eroding volcanic cones that surround the Valley of Mexico. The southern part of the city rests on hardened basalt lava flows. The old lakebed, with its high water content, is easily moved or compressed. The old lakeshore area also has a fairly high water content, allowing movement, though not as much as the lakebed. The old lava flows have little water content or movement in comparison and are therefore more stable. Another factor is that the old lakebed resonates with certain seismic waves and low frequency signals. This lakebed has a natural \\"pitch\\" of one cycle every 2.5 seconds making everything built on the bed vibrate at the same frequency. This is the same \\"pitch\\" as a number of shallow earthquake waves. This resonance amplifies the effects of the shock waves coming from an earthquake far away. However, only certain types of structures are vulnerable to this resonance effect. Taller buildings have their own frequencies of vibration. Those that are six to fifteen stories tall also vibrate at the 2.5-second cycle, making them act like tuning forks in the event of an earthquake. The low-frequency waves of an earthquake are amplified by the mud of the lakebed, which in turn, is amplified by the building itself. This causes these buildings to shake more violently than the earthquake proper as the earthquake progresses. Many of the older colonial buildings have survived hundreds of years on the lakebed simply because they are not tall enough to be affected by the resonance effect. Earthquake USGS ShakeMap for the event The earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of the Mexican state of Michoac√°n, a distance of more than from the city, in the Cocos Plate subduction zone, specifically in a section of the fault line known as the Michoac√°n seismic gap. The Cocos Plate pushes against and slides under the North American Plate, primarily along the coasts of the states of Michoac√°n and Guerrero in Mexico. Volatile trenches along the Cocos plate generally have had seismic events 30 to 70 years before 1985. This subduction zone outside the Michoac√°n gap was the source of 42 earthquakes of magnitude 7.8 or stronger in the 20th century prior to the 1985 event. However, this particular section of the subduction zone had not had an event for a much longer time. Mexico city - Building collapsed. Shockwaves from the earthquake hit the mouth of the R√≠o Balsas on the coast at 7:17 am and hit Mexico City, away, two minutes later at 7:19 am. The 19 September quake was a multiple event with two epicenters and the second movement occurring 26 seconds after the first. Because of multiple breaks in the fault line, the event was of long duration. Ground shaking lasted more than five minutes in places along the coast and parts of Mexico City shook for three minutes, with an average shaking time of 3‚Äì4 minutes. It is estimated the movement along the fault was about . The main tremor was foreshadowed by a quake of magnitude 5.2 on 28 May 1985, and was followed by two significant aftershocks: one on 20 September 1985 of magnitude 7.5 lasting thirteen seconds and the third occurring seven months later on 30 April 1986 with magnitude 7.0 lasting ten seconds. However, at least twelve other minor aftershocks were associated with the seismic event. The energy released during the main event was equivalent to approximately 1,114 nuclear weapons exploding. The earthquake was felt over 825,000 square kilometers, as far away as Los Angeles and Houston in the United States. In the port of L√°zaro C√°rdenas, near the epicenter, the 19 September event registered as IX on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale; in parts of Mexico City, it registered the same, even at a distance of about 400 km (249 mi) away. There was no historic record of such a strong quake in Mexico. While the fault line was located just off the Pacific coast of Mexico, there was relatively little effect on the sea itself. The earthquake did produce a number of tsunamis but they were small, ranging between in height. Ecuador reported the highest waves of . Damage Apartment Complex Pino Su√°rez, in the wake of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. Most of the earthquake damage was to buildings. Two reasons are the resonance in the lakebed sediments and the long duration of the shaking. The buildings most damaged were from 6 to 15 stories in height. These buildings tended to resonate most with the energetic frequency band of the lakebed motions. One interesting characteristic was that many buildings had their upper floors collapse, leaving the lower floors relatively undamaged. In many damaged buildings, just one floor had collapsed. In some cases the damage was caused by the top of a lower, adjacent building banging against the walls and the supporting columns of its neighbor. Eventually, the columns gave way. In other cases, the first few floors of buildings were designed as parking garages, open lobbies or large shopping areas. These \\"soft\\" stories were particularly flexible and tended to collapse after prolonged shaking. Some types of foundations, particularly those involving piles driven into clay and held in place by friction, turned out to be weak. One nine-story building, for example, overturned. Its piles were pulled entirely out of the ground. Aftermath of Earthquake, Mexico City. A survey by the government of the damage done found that few buildings from one to five stories suffered serious damage; the same was true for buildings over fifteen stories. When the buildings were built seemed to have an effect as well. Before the 1957 earthquake, there were no building codes with respect to earthquake resistance. Some regulations were passed in that year and more in 1976 after another, stronger earthquake shook the city. However, none of these regulations had an event like 1985's in mind when passed. Most of the seriously damaged buildings were built between 1957 and 1976, when the city was starting to build upwards, in the six-to-fifteen floor range. In second place were buildings from before 1957, possibly because they were weakened by the earlier earthquakes. Structures built between 1976 and 1985 suffered the least damage. At the time of the earthquake, Mexico City had one of the most stringent building codes, based on experience gained from earthquakes in 1957 and 1979. However, the codes were not designed for seismic activity of the intensity experienced in 1985. The event was one of the most intense ever recorded, and macroseismic waves arrived in the Valley of Mexico with unusually high energy content. Prior to the event, estimates about ground movement on the lakebed were generally accepted and a number of buildings were built on these estimates. Several notable buildings were relatively untouched by the quake. One significant example is the Torre Latinoamericana. Despite being 44 stories tall, it survived the 1985 event almost undamaged. It was constructed with two hundred piles extending down over into the stable earth stratum. =Localization of the damage= Mexico City is divided into boroughs. Eighty percent of the earthquake damage was confined to four of them: Venustiano Carranza, Cuauht√©moc, Benito Ju√°rez and Gustavo A. Madero. The damage area corresponds to the western part of the lake zone within of the Alameda Central. Nearly all the buildings that collapsed were located in this lake zone that extended from Tlatelolco in the north to Viaducto Miguel Alem√°n in the south, Chapultepec Park in the west and to a short distance east of the Z√≥calo or main plaza. =Building damage in the city= Aftermath of Earthquake, Mexico City. Cuauht√©moc, which includes the historic downtown, suffered the most damage. In this particular area, 258 buildings completely crumbled, 143 partially collapsed and 181 were seriously damaged. The next seriously affected area was Venustiano Carranza where 83 buildings collapsed, 128 partially collapsed and 2,000 structures were seriously damaged. Damage was localized to the center parts of the city, leaving much of the residential outer rim unscathed, but the damage in the affected area was extensive. Over 720,000 tons of debris was removed during the first six weeks after the event. The Metropolitan Commission for Emergencies of the Federal District reported 2,831 buildings damaged for the entire city: 31% or 880 were completely ruined, 13% were reinhabitable with major repairs and the rest, totaling 1581, were recoverable with minor repairs. This translates to more than 30,000 housing units completely destroyed and another 68,000 units damaged. Hospital Ju√°rez One of the most visible government institutions to fall in the event was the tower of Hospital Ju√°rez, one of the oldest hospital institutions in Mexico. It was founded in 1847, converting the old convent of San Pablo to treat wounded soldiers from the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. It originally was called San Pablo Hospital but its name was changed to Ju√°rez Hospital in 1872. The \\"Torre de Hospitalizaci√≥n\\" was built in 1970 with the main building being twelve stories tall. It had two wings, one facing north and the other south, with an inpatient capacity of 536 beds. At the top was a helipad. It was also surrounded by a number of other buildings belonging to the hospital complex such as a blood bank, teaching facilities, offices as well as the original convent. At the time of the earthquake, the hospital was 80% full, and it was shift change time for nurses, doctors and residents. Within minutes, the steel-frame structure collapsed, crushing and trapping many people inside. Those who were rescued first were taken to another building for treatment, as the ambulances were trapped inside the collapsed tower. The hospital did not have an emergency plan but nonetheless, surviving hospital workers and neighbors quickly improvised, under the management of the hospital, setting up aid stations and scavenging supplies. Rescue workers soon arrived to start digging through the rubble. A second quake made rescue work slower, because of fear of further collapse. Most bodies were identified by personal effects, some by dental records and some were so mangled that they wound up being cremated without ever being identified, due to the lack of morgue facilities. 561 bodies were found and 188 were never identified. 266 were hospital workers and 44 were medical residents. The majority who were rescued were found in the first five days. The number of bodies recovered was high during those first days as well but the numbers dramatically increased between days 17 and 31. Heavy machinery was unable to get to the site until five days after the earthquake. Numbers of dead did not include unidentified body parts found. Most of the injured had contusion injuries and many suffered from dehydration, with the severity of the dehydration increasing with those rescued later. However, the most memorable story to come from this event was the rescue of nearly all the newborn babies that were in the nursery at the time. These babies were pulled out of the wreckage mostly unscathed but lost their mothers. The infants were found seven days after the initial event and came to be known as the \\"Miracle Babies\\" or the \\"Miracle of Hospital Ju√°rez\\", having survived without nourishment, water, warmth or human contact during that time. Sewing factory Bronze statue of a seamstress at corner of Manuel J Oth√≥n and San Antonio Abad at site of collapsed factory On Manuel Jos√© Oth√≥n Street, in the Colonia Obrera neighborhood, near Metro station San Antonio Abad, was one of the many garment factories located in the city center area. It was destroyed along with approximately 1,200 other workshops. Called \\"Topeka\\", it was one of three buildings that collapsed on this block. The magazine Proceso reported that by the time rescue workers reached the building, the owners were already in a hurry to demolish it, without trying to rescue or recover the workers trapped inside. About 150 bodies of workers had already been pulled from the wreckage by fellow employees using their bare hands. The collapse of this factory exposed the deplorable conditions to which many of these women were subjected. The building that collapsed, as well as many others, were found to be decrepit. It came to be known that many of the women had to work extended hours with little or no compensation, and few, if any, of the labor laws on the books were being followed. This event made the garment industry a labor embarrassment. All that remains of the factory is a small empty lot with a bronze statue of a woman sewing. Apartments were built on the remainder of the property. Conalep SPP Conalep building The Conalep SPP was a building located between the streets of Iturbide and Humboldt, in the Historic Center of Mexico City, which succumbed to the Richter-scale 8.1-degree earthquake on 19 September 1985. In this school the classes normally started at 7 o'clock in the morning, so the students were already in class. Some data indicate that around 120 people died and some disappeared in this building. Literally this building was split in two, the part that overlooked Humboldt Street stood and the part that overlooked Iturbide Street collapsed falling floor to floor and pulling the building towards that street. Central Communications Center On Eje Central and Xola Avenue, at the southern end of the lakebed zone was (and is) the Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones y Transportes (Ministry of Communication and Transportation), a reinforced concrete structure with its microwave tower. This structure failed, causing the near total collapse of long distance communications between Mexico City and the rest of the world. Conjunto Pino Su√°rez The current market at the Conjunto Pino Suarez site. One of the most spectacular building collapses was that of the Conjunto Pino Su√°rez, which was a complex of five steel-frame buildings. A 20-story tower, Tower Four, doubled over at the third floor and fell south onto a fourteen-story building. The fall left a huge piece of concrete blocking the road that leads to the Z√≥calo. People at the scene stated that there was simply no time to run and escape the building's fall. The other three 20-story buildings were closed because of damage, as well as the Metro entrance next door. The building was occupied by family courts and offices of the public defender. The area is now a market. Hotel Regis Plaza of Solidarity at site of former Hotel Regis The Hotel Regis was built in the beginning of the 20th century as a luxury hotel in neo-Classical style. It had its own cabaret, gourmet restaurant and a small but luxurious cinema with wide reclining armchairs. It was located at the corner of Balderas and Avenida Ju√°rez in the historic center and completely collapsed within moments of the quake. Shortly after its collapse, it began to burn due to a gas leak, which made it extremely difficult to rescue survivors. Nothing survived of the hotel. The space is now the Plaza de la Solidaridad park. The Museo Mural Diego Rivera on the north side of the park houses a mural by Diego Rivera which was originally housed in the huge Hotel Del Prado across the street. That hotel was irreparably damaged in the earthquake and subsequently demolished. Apartment complexes in Tlatelolco Mexico City Earthquake, 19 September 1985. There were two apartment complexes in the area of the city called Tlatelolco to the north of the historic center that became major scenes of disaster, the Conjunto Urbano Nonoalco Tlatelolco and the \\"Multifamiliares Ju√°rez\\" near the Metro Centro M√©dico. Together, these apartment complexes were a large percentage of the 30,000 units lost, with the city losing about 30% of its living space. Nuevo Le√≥n apartment building; part of the structure was only slightly damaged, while another part of it collapsed. Nonoalco Tlatelolco was located on Paseo de la Reforma Norte #668, covering an area of about . It had 102 buildings with seven medical facilities, twenty-two schools and about 500 small businesses, serving the 80,000 people who lived there. Constructed under the presidency of Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos, it was considered the most important complex of its kind in the country. In the Conjunto Urbano, two of the three modules of the building called \\"Nuevo Le√≥n\\", at thirteen stories tall, completely collapsed, while the other one was severely damaged. In other buildings, dozens of people terrified by the event jumped from high windows to their deaths, trying to escape. People became trapped in stairwells, elevators and their apartments without any way to contact the outside world. At the collapsed building, lines of 50‚Äì100 people passed rubble by hand and buckets, trying to reach victims. During these rescue efforts, a nearby building, called Oaxaca, began to creak noisily, causing everyone to run and abandon the site temporarily, but it did not collapse. All the buildings suffered damage but along with the collapsed Nuevo Le√≥n building, buildings such as those called Veracruz, Coahuila, Zacatecas, Oaxaca, Puebla, Jalisco, Churubusco, Guelatao, 2 de Abril, 15 de Septiembre, Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, ISSSTE 11, Quer√©taro, Guanajuato, Ignacio Comonfort, Ignacio M. Altamirano, Jes√∫s Ter√°n, Ponciano Arriaga, Ni√±os H√©roes and 20 de Noviembre suffered severe damage such as deeply cracked foundations. In the days after the quake, military and police cordoned off ten buildings to keep people out, leading a number of them to sleep on the streets. Twelve buildings in the complex were so badly damaged that they were demolished in the next six months. Buildings A1, B2 and C3 of the Multifamiliar Ju√°rez complex partially collapsed with a total of nine structures eventually being demolished. Televisa studios Televisa building at Ni√±os H√©roes and Chapultepec Ave. One of the more famous images of the event was the live broadcast of Hoy Mismo, a news program in the Televisa television network, when the earthquake struck. In the video, movement can be seen, especially in the lights above the newscasters. The three newscasters were Mar√≠a Victoria Llamas (substituting for Guillermo Ochoa), Lourdes Guerrero and Juan Dosal. As the movement began Llamas reports grabbing the underside of the desk, and whispering quickly to her colleagues that she hoped no one could see how scared she was. The last image broadcast from the studio was that of Lourdes Guerrero stating \\"... it's still shaking a little (sigue temblando un poquitito), but we must take it calmly. We will wait just a second so we can keep talking.\\" Then the image disappeared. The transmission ended because a nearby 10-ton antenna had bent over and crushed parts of Televisa's buildings that were located on Ni√±os H√©roes and Dr. R√≠o de la Loza Streets in Colonia Doctores. Everyone ran from the studio but Llamas and Guerrero stayed, hiding under their anchor desks. After the shaking stopped, they both left the Televisa studios through a back door, and hours later they were back on the air in the studios of Canal de las Estrellas to broadcast live what was happening. Some members of the Hoy Mismo staff died, including producer Ernesto Villanueva and engineer David Mendoza C√≥rcega, who had just parked at the Televisa building, but had no time to escape from his car. The falling debris also killed street vendors who worked just outside the studio building. Reconstruction of the studio building began in 1995 and ended in 2000. Other structures * Televicentro (now Televisa Chapultepec) * Los Televiteatros (now Centro Cultural Telmex) * Hotel D'Carlo and Hotel Prado, which were located in the Alameda Central area near the Hotel Regis * Arena Mexico. All the lucha libre events scheduled for that weekend were cancelled. =Infrastructure= The region's infrastructure was severely affected. The number of people with potable water went from six million to 90,000. as of primary and secondary water and drainage pipes suffered breaks in 163 places, cutting off water and contaminating it. of asphalt was damaged, and 137 schools collapsed. The number of jobs lost due to the event was estimated at 200,000. Forty percent of the population was without electricity and seventy percent without telephone service. 1,687 school buildings were damaged. Interruption of classes, either to the lack of facilities and/or the need to help with rescue efforts, affected over 1.5 million students. =Mexico City Metro= On the day of the quake, the Metro stopped service and completely shut down for fear of electrocution. This caused people to get out of the tunnels from wherever they were and onto the street to try to get where they were going. At the time, the Metro had 101 stations, with 32 closed to the public in the weeks after the event. On Line 1, there was no service in stations Merced, Pino Su√°rez, Isabel la Cat√≥lica, Salto del Agua, Balderas or Cuauht√©moc. On Line 2, there was no service between stations Bellas Artes and Taxque√±a. On Line 3 only Ju√°rez and Balderas were closed. Line 4 continued to operate normally. All of the closed stations were in the historic center area, with the exception of the stations of Line 2 south of Pino Su√°rez. These stations were located above ground. The reason these stations were closed was not due to damage to the Metro proper, but rather because of surface rescue work and clearing of debris. =Hospitals= The area most severely hit by the earthquake had the highest concentration of hospitals. Most of the damage occurred in secondary and tertiary hospitals. Thirteen hospitals of six or more floors were partially or totally destroyed, most of these public institutions. One out of every four then-available beds were lost. The National Medical Center of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) was considered the most important hospital complex in Latin America with over 2,300 beds and the largest medical library in the country. It had to be evacuated because all of its 25 buildings suffered severe damage. Most of the beds that it lost were dedicated to tertiary, high-technology care. The ISSSTE hospital for government workers lost 36 percent of its capacity. The 2,158 beds of the Ministry of Health (SSA) were lost, representing 43 percent of its capacity in the city. This included the 700 beds lost with the complete collapse of Ju√°rez Hospital and the gynecology-obstetrics tower of the General Hospital of Mexico. In total, the city lost more than 4,000 public hospital beds in the earthquake, severely disrupting these institutions' ability to handle the crisis. In addition, five of the largest private hospitals had to be evacuated. More than 900 patients, physicians, nurses and paramedical workers died in the initial shock. In contrast, the network of twenty four community general hospitals with 1,600 beds belonging to the city (federal district) were not affected as these were spread out beyond the city center and the old lakebed. =Outside Mexico City= Although much closer to the epicenter, the states of Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Michoac√°n suffered only mild to moderate damage. Landslides caused damage at Atenquique, Jalisco, and near Jala, Nayarit. Rockslides were reported along highways near Ixtapa, Guerrero, with sand volcanos and ground cracks in Lazaro Cardenas. Students at the Universidad de las Am√©ricas in nearby Puebla reported feeling as if the cafeteria had been lifted and rocked back and forth, shattering windows and injuring some people but mostly causing panic. A small tsunami caused only mild damage to L√°zaro C√°rdenas and Zihuatanejo. Some fishing boats were reported missing but these reports were never confirmed. One exceptional case was in Ciudad Guzm√°n, Jalisco, where about 60 percent of the buildings were destroyed, with about 50 dead. Some damage also occurred as far away as the states of Mexico, Morelos and parts of Veracruz, on the Gulf coast. Coastal and most inland damage was moderated by the fact that most of the west of Mexico sits on bedrock, which serves to transmit the shockwaves without amplifying them. La Villita, and Infiernillo Dams, near the coast, were superficially damaged and undamaged respectively. Off the coasts of Michoac√°n and Guerrero, the 19 and 20 September events caused a rupture in the seabed 240 km long and 70 km wide, located between the subduction trench and the coastline. This is an intertidal zone and the event caused widespread mortality in a number of species living in the area such as algae and shellfish. Death toll Eight-story frame structure with brick infill walls broken in two. The foundation also came off. To this day, the death toll has been in dispute. About 5,000 bodies were recovered from the debris and represent the total of legally certified deaths but does not include those who were missing and never recovered. Reports have numbered the dead anywhere from 5,000 to 30,000 (claimed by a number of citizens' groups) to 45,000 claimed by the National Seismological Service. However, the most commonly cited figures are around 10,000. While high as an absolute number, it compares to other earthquakes of similar strength in Asia and other parts of Latin America where death tolls have run between 66,000 and 242,000 for earthquakes of magnitude 7.8 or above. Part of the explanation for that was the hour in which the earthquake struck, approximately 7:20 am, when people were awake but not in the many schools and office buildings that were severely damaged. However, the death toll was great enough to require the use of the IMSS baseball field as a morgue, using ice to conserve bodies for identification. The main reason that the figures have been disputed is the government's response to the tragedy. President Miguel de la Madrid ordered a news blackout and did not address the situation at all for 39 hours after the event. When the government did give estimates of the number killed, they ranged from 7,000 to 35,000. Consequently, most of the populace believes that the true numbers have never been revealed. According to government figures, approximately 250,000 people lost their homes directly due to the earthquake. Unofficial sources put that figure much higher. Some sources say that more than 50,000 families lost their homes. INEGI reports that 700,000 people in Mexico City and the suburbs in the State of Mexico lost their homes. Response In the hours and days immediately after the first shock, there was an enormous response and solidarity among the city population of 18 million people. Ordinary citizens organized brigades to help with rescue efforts and to provide food, clothing and emotional support to the homeless. Patients had to be moved from damaged hospitals, especially the National Medical Center. Many of these patients were very ill. 1,900 patients were successfully moved from here, without any deaths, in just four hours. More than 4,000 people were rescued alive. 9,600 injured people received treatment, including 1,879 who needed hospitalization. Despite the loss of 5,000 hospital beds, there was never a shortage of facilities for the injured. Some of the reason for this was that those with postponable care were discharged, but mostly because the public and private facilities unified de facto during the crisis. There were also people rescued as late as ten days after the initial event. =Government= First ladies Paloma Cordero of Mexico (left) and Nancy Reagan of the United States (right) with U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, John Gavin observing the damage done by the earthquake. The military was deployed to patrol streets to prevent looting after a curfew was imposed, as well as rescue, sanitary efforts and other, with 1,836 soldiers initially sent in and another 1,500 conscripts sent later. The federal government's first public response was President de la Madrid's declaration of a period of mourning for three days starting from 20 September 1985. These earthquakes created many political difficulties for the then- ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) or Institutional Revolutionary Party. The crisis was severe enough to have tested the capabilities of wealthier countries, but the government from local PRI bosses to President de la Madrid himself exacerbated the problem aside from the lack of money. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared it would not request aid; it specifically rejected help from the United States. It was also widely reported in the days after the earthquake that the military assisted factory owners in retrieving their machinery rather than in removing the bodies of dead factory workers. At many levels of the government, who was helped and by how much was determined by one's standing vis-√†-vis the PRI. Those belonging to the party received preference and those considered opposition received the runaround. President de la Madrid refused to cut foreign debt payments to use the money to help with the recovery effort. The government's response to the earthquake was widely criticized at various levels of Mexican society, being seen as both authoritarian and incompetent. As most of the collapsed buildings were of recent construction and public works projects, the government was seen at fault due to mismanagement and corruption in these constructions. The government itself realized that it could not handle the crisis alone through already-established institutions and decided to open the process up to \\"opposition groups\\". =Community= Housing project by CUD on Dr Andrade Street in Colonia Doctores On the other hand, the disaster created an opportunity for political opponents, especially at the grassroots level. Much of the community organizing focused on helping those left homeless by the earthquake. The three largest and most effective organizations were based in Tlatelolco and Colonia Roma. These consisted of families from the \\"Multifamiliar Ju√°rez\\" housing project, which completely collapsed and the combined colonias (neighborhoods) of Centro, Morelos, Guerrero, Doctores, Obrera, Peralvillo, Asturias, Nicol√°s Bravo among others which housed the working and lower classes. These groups along with the Sindicato Nacional de Costureras united to form the Coordinadora √önica de Damnificados (CUD). CUD and other popular movement representatives met the head of the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology (SEDUE) Guillermo Carrillo Arena on 27 September 1985. Carrillo Arena at first insisted that the movements incorporate themselves into the PRI before gaining any concessions. This was refused. Many media outlets expressed support for the popular movements and marches like that of 2 October 1985, demanding that the reconstruction process be more \\"democratic\\", meaning the inclusion of non-PRI political organizations into the decision-making process. On 11 October 1985, the President granted a seven-minute audience to the heads of a dozen popular movements, which turned into a 45-minute meeting where de la Madrid was handed a document outlining what would remain the movements' core demands: expropriation of all condemned buildings, followed by a \\"popular\\" and \\"democratic\\" reconstruction project which would include the active participation of the community movement. De la Madrid conceded some with the expropriation of 5,500 properties in the four most affected boroughs. After the government created the Programa de Renovaci√≥n Habitacional Popular (PRHP) on 14 October to help deal with the crisis, friction between the government and community groups grew again, PRHP used PRI-membership as a requirement to be included into the census of earthquake victims. More protests followed on 26 October calling for, among other things, the firing of SEDUE head Carrillo Arena. Things got worse through February 1986, mostly due to the ineffectiveness of SEDUE and PRHP. Finally Carrillo Arena was fired from SEDUE and replaced by Manuel Camacho Sol√≠s. In March, only weeks after taking office, Camacho Sol√≠s changed the charged atmosphere between SEDUE and the community groups. He actively integrated Tlateloloco citizen groups into a new program meant for that area, defusing the most volatile area of the city. Camacho Sol√≠s continued to work to integrate and smooth relations between his agency and the community groups. On 16 May 1986, Camacho Sol√≠s met with the heads of all the major groups. He offered a commitment to build 48,000 housing units in one year if the groups would all sign a \\"Convenio de concertaci√≥n democr√°tica para la reconstrucci√≥n de vivienda\\" (Democratic agreement for the reconstruction of housing). Basically, this document required the cooperation of community groups in exchange for solid commitments from the agency. All sides would compromise in order to get something done. The deal generally worked; movements like CUD moderated their stances and agencies like SEDUE and PRHP made progress in rebuilding housing, regardless of political affiliation. =Foreign rescue help= The Israeli Rescue Delegation under the command of Col. Avner Shmuelevitz (with the yellow helmet and green uniform). The Mexican government, thinking that it could handle the situation after the earthquake by themselves, initially refused any foreign aid. As an aftershock struck on 20 September, the Mexican government then announced that it would be willing to accept help. Heavy machinery, medical supplies, and excavation equipment descended into the city to help with rescue efforts. First Lady Nancy Reagan toured Mexico City with U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, John Gavin, observing the resulting damage of the earthquake.Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training-ADST Few countries sent rescue delegations to support these efforts. One of the prominent group was the Israeli delegation of the Israel Defence Force (I.D.F.), which was enthusiastically welcomed and hosted by the Jewish community of Mexico City. Political consequences Mexico city - Collapsed upper stories and construction equipment at work at the Ministry of Telecommunications and Transportation building. Images of Mexico City Earthquake, 19 September 1985. At the time of the earthquake, Mexico was in its fourth year of a foreign debt crisis, and a contracting economy causing serious political problems for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Much of the PRI's authoritarian nature was tolerated because the country had seen four decades of economic expansion of six percent or better. When this disappeared, the PRI's power base began to shrink. Its reputation was damaged further when the government seemed to be deliberately downplaying the number of earthquake victims. President de la Madrid made relatively few public appearances afterwards and during those he did, he received strong heckling, in contrast to the near-reverence that past presidents enjoyed at such events. The severe damage in so many buildings, including in many public works construction projects to house the rapidly growing population of Mexico City, was blamed on lax enforcement of building codes. Critics argued that the lack of enforcement of such codes was indicative of corrupt practices in all levels of government. The stepping-in of non-PRI organizations to take over where the government could not, also took its toll on PRI's reputation. Burton Kirkwood stated, \\"Out of the disaster emerged the realization that a viable civil society existed in Mexico. This revelation also caused many to consider why they needed a centralized state that so obviously could not care for its people. As a consequence, the opposition movements pointed to the government's shortcomings and advanced candidates for the greater goal of defeating the PRI.\\" Shortly after the event, the PRI began to face serious challenges at the polls, resulting in attempts to rig elections. Legacy One preparation that was made for any future events was the alert system, Sistema de Alerta S√≠smica (SAS), which sends early-warning messages electronically from sensors along the coastal subduction zone in Guerrero. It was expanded to a similar area on the coast of Oaxaca. An alarm is supposed to go off in Mexico City (similar to an air-raid siren) when an earthquake of 6.0 or higher is detected. To better help deal with major disasters, the Civil Protection Committee was created. This committee organizes drills in cooperation with rescue workers, police, hospital staff and even metro personnel. Affiliated with the Civil Protection Committee is the \\"Brigada de Topos de Tlatelolco\\" (Mole Brigade of Tlatelolco). This group arose from youths who spontaneously volunteered to risk their lives crawling into collapsed buildings to look for survivors. Despite having no equipment, training or knowledge of rescue tactics, these youths were instrumental in saving a number of lives, including the babies rescued from the collapse of the Ju√°rez Hospital. Shortly thereafter, these youths decided to formally band together in February 1986. These \\"topos\\" have developed into highly trained specialists in times of disaster, with branches in other parts of Mexico. They are now expertly trained and even have scent dogs to help them. They have gained international fame as they have helped in disasters in San Salvador, Taiwan, in the countries of the rim of the Indian Ocean after the tsunami there in 2004, and in the January 2010 Haiti earthquake. Despite warnings and predictions, in 2005, an estimated 32 million people live in the high-risk lakebed area. In 2005, there were still two camps where approximately eighty families are still waiting for relocation from the earthquake. Centuries-old structures have been reinforced across the city and new construction must comply with very strict codes. There are several instances of tall buildings in Mexico City incorporating earthquake-resistant engineering. A few notable examples are: the Torre Latinoamericana, one of the first buildings in Mexico City to do so, the Torre Ejecutiva Pemex, built before the 1985 earthquake, and the Torre Mayor, built in 2003. Every 19 September, in all public buildings at Mexico City and all the nation the civil protection authorities conduct evacuation drills to evaluate the evacuation response in the case of an earthquake. On 19 September 2017, 32 years after the 1985 earthquake, Mexico City also faced another earthquake at around 13:14 CDT (18:14 UTC), nearly two hours after the earthquake drills took place.

The patient was hospitalized because he suffered from violent horrible nightmares and killed his wife whom he loved very much in his sleep. The patient is catatonic. *Dreaming This song is about the night that the Patient kills his wife. He suffocates her while having a nightmare. *Waking The Patient wakes up to realize what he's done. He calls the police and turns himself in and he is waiting for the ambulance. He can't believe what he's done, he wants to take it back. He covers the house with her perfume. *Sentencing The judge and the doctors decide whether to charge him with murder and send him to jail or declare him mentally unstable and send him to the hospital. The doctor thinks he should be hospitalized. *Medicating The Patient is in the hospital and tries to convince the doctor to release him. He wants to go back to his life and he thinks that the hospital is just making him worse. The doctor agrees and releases him from the hospital. *Purging The Patient has been released and is returning into society. Everyone is shocked at his quick return into society/work considering what he did. The guilt becomes overpowering inside of him and he cuts off his hands so he won't ever kill again. *Relapsing The Patient is back in the hospital after cutting off his hands and he begins to hear his wife's voice in his head. He begins trying to fill his emptiness by writing a song inside his head. *Recovering The Patient is on medication since he is catatonic and he is on painkillers due to his lack of hands. He begins taking more pills than necessary and all he can hear is the song inside of his head. He takes more and more pills to keep the song playing. *Composing The Patient convinces the doctor he's getting better and requests to see his friends and family because he thinks it'll help him recover. He starts inviting friends and family over for dinner to poison them. He is \\"composing\\" his song by killing people and he thinks that he can see his wife. He laments having to dispose of the bodies and having to repeat the process. *Disintegrating The Patient is completely isolated with the song inside his head. He is abusing alcohol and drugs and in a state between the living and dead. He's thinking of everyone he's killed and needs a finale to his song. In a dream he hears his wife tell him that although he killed his family and friends to see her, he still has to kill the doctor (\\"'The doctor has to go,' was the last thing that she said as I felt my body back in bed. But then I guess it's always been his job to fix this.\\") *Healing The Patient calls the doctor with the intent of killing himself so he can finally see his wife again. *Dying Dying is shown from the perspective of the doctor (though The Patient introduces the song) as opposed to the perspective of the patient. It is the same setting and situation as Healing, but while The Patient seems composed in the lyrics and delivery of Healing, the more haunting and bizarre singing style by which the strange and pained lyrics are delivered in Dying represents The Patient's actual state of mind.

Early life Boyd was born in County Tyrone, Ireland on September 9, 1834. He moved to Belmont County, Ohio, with his family in 1844. His education was in the common schools. As he grew older, James and his brother, Joseph Boyd, managed the Boyd Ranch just west of Gibbon, Nebraska, and eventually married Anna Henry, an army doctor stationed at Fort Kearny, on August 22, 1858.Gov. James E. Boyd papers at the Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved on 2009-07-06. The Boyd ranch served as a stopping point for travelers moving out west along the Oregon and Mormon Trails. Travelers who had tired or worn out horses or oxen could trade for well-rested animals capable of pulling the large wagons across the Nebraska Prairie. As the Ranch business started to plummet, Joesph, sold his share of the ranching enterprise to James who then invested in 24 mule teams and other pieces of equipment to start a freight business. Among the first freight brought out from Missouri was lumber for a new ranch house, built between 1864 and 1868, at the Trails and Rails Museum today. While his two previous business enterprises made the Boyd Ranch well known across the state and the country, James secured a contract with the Union Pacific to build 300 miles of track. As a result of this contract, the James Boyd family became very wealthy lead him to many more endeavors.

He managed the administration‚Äôs economic policy agenda. Before serving in the White House, Cohn was President and Chief Operating Officer of Goldman Sachs, where he worked for more than 25 years. Following his White House service, Cohn became an advisor and venture capital investor for companies operating in the cybersecurity, blockchain infrastructure, and medical technology sectors. He currently serves on the Board of Advisors for Hoyos Integrity, a startup company employing biometric blockchain technology for secure communications and digital payments. Cohn is also the Chairman of the Advisory Board at Pallas Advisors, a national security strategic advisory firm based in Washington, DC. Early life Gary Cohn was born to an Eastern European Jewish family, the son of Victor and Ellen Cohn, and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. His father was an electrician who later became a real estate developer. Cohn was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age, and attended four schools by the time he reached the sixth grade. Cohn's childhood experiences with dyslexia were a featured case study in David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell. Cohn studied at Gilmour Academy, and attended American University's Kogod School of Business between Fall 1979 and Spring 1982, where he majored in Finance, Real Estate, and Urban Development, and graduated in three years on 16 May 1982 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. Career Cohn at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2010 Cohn started his career at the U.S. Steel home products division in Cleveland, Ohio. After a few months, he left U.S. Steel and became an options dealer in the New York Mercantile Exchange. He taught himself the basics of options by reading about it in the days between meeting the hiring manager and joining the New York Mercantile Exchange.David and Goliath Cohn was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 1990 and became a partner at the firm in 1994. In 1996, he was named head of the commodities department, and in 2002, he was named the head of the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) division. In 2003, he was named co-head of Equities, and in January 2004, Cohn was named the co- head of global securities businesses. He became President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, and director in June 2006. While at Goldman Sachs, Cohn was also a member of the firm's Board of Directors and Chairman of the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee. In 2010, Cohn testified to Congress on the role of Goldman Sachs in the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Cohn testified: \\"During the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business. We did not 'bet against our clients', and the numbers underscore this fact.\\" National Economic Council Director On January 20, 2017, Cohn took office as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in President Donald Trump's administration, a position which did not require Congressional confirmation. By February 11, 2017, The Wall Street Journal described Cohn as an \\"economic- policy powerhouse\\", and The New York Times called him Trump's \\"go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business, and growth\\". With the confirmation of Trump's December 12, 2016, nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, held back by Congressional hearings, Cohn filled in the \\"personnel vacuum\\" and pushed \\"ahead on taxes, infrastructure, financial regulation, and replacing health-care law\\". Had Cohn stayed at Goldman Sachs, some believed he would have become CEO when Lloyd Blankfein vacated that office. In addition to his $285 million Goldman Sachs severance package, Cohn also sold a stake in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank (as of 2017), then valued at $16 million. Vice President Mike Pence, Gary Cohn, and Steve Mnuchin watch tax reform vote. Cohn supports reinstating the Glass- Steagall legislation, which would separate commercial and investment banking. Under the Trump administration, Cohn was cited by the press as a supporter of globalism, and was given nicknames such as \\"Globalist Gary\\" and \\"Carbon Tax Cohn\\". Along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and Dina Powell, they were referred to by opponents as the \\"Wall Street-wing\\" of the Trump administration. He was stated as being at odds with the populist faction that was led by Steve Bannon, when Bannon was White House Chief Strategist. Cohn led the Trump administration's efforts to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In a 2019 article in The Wall Street Journal, Cohn pointed to an increase of $6,000 in real disposable personal income per household, as well as the creation of seven million jobs, as evidence of the success of tax reform. Cohn reportedly considered resigning from the National Economic Council after the 2017 Charlottesville rally https://www.ft.com/content/cb068f94-8915-11e7-bf50-e1c239b45787 and criticized the Trump administration's response to the rally, stating \\"I believe this administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning,\\" white supremacists. In August 2020, Jim Scuitto published a book called The Madman Theory in which Cohn said in response to Donald Trump saying that there were very good people on both sides of the protests which included white supremacists, \\"Citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK. https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-madman-theory-jim- sciutto?variant=32117494939682 On March 6, 2018, Cohn announced his intention to resign; the announcement followed Trump's proposal to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum, and Trump's cancellation of a meeting with end-users of steel and aluminum that Cohn had arranged in an attempt to dissuade the president from the planned tariffs. He was replaced by Larry Kudlow on April 2. In August 2018, Bob Woodward published a book containing the allegation that Cohn removed a draft letter from President Trump's desk, so the President would not sign it. The letter would have canceled a trade agreement with South Korea, in addition to unilateral withdrawals from the Canadian and Mexican trade agreements.  Venture capital  Following his departure from the White House, Cohn became an advisor and venture capital investor for companies in the cybersecurity, blockchain, and digital payments sectors. He currently serves on the Board of Spring Labs, a startup using blockchain technology to share consumer credit data, and Hoyos Integrity, a company employing biometric blockchain technology for secure communications and mobile payments. Cohn is also a key advisor for Machine Zone and Abryx, a biomaterial science company. Cohn discusses the future of blockchain communications and payments. At Hoyos Integrity, Cohn is deeply involved in the strategy and rollout of a next- generation secure mobile phone aimed at government and corporate customers. The company is also planning to launch a digital wallet ‚Äî which employs more sophisticated biometrics ‚Äî that consumers can use to make payments using a wide range of monetary assets, including bitcoin. The wallet will also be insured up to $1 million if hacked and will adhere to strict Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulations. The underlying technology of Hoyos' digital wallet and FIPS was born out of military-grade digital secure vault technologies. Unlike traditional digital wallets, it is designed to provide significant privacy protections to consumers as it does not mine their data, performs unique biometrics-based identity authentication on every transaction, and holds any digital fiat or cryptocurrency. The Hoyos wallet platform underwent stringent testing by U.S. government security contractors and in an international hackathon contest, and was not breached. In April 2020, Cohn was appointed to the Risk & Governance Advisory Board of Starling, and technology company in applied behavior sciences. In August 2020, Cohn and investor Clifton S. Robbins launched Cohn Robbins Holdings Corp.  Harvard Kennedy School  In 2019, Cohn served as a Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School where he taught a seminar alongside former U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp on economic, demographic, and national security policy.. Cohn and Heitkamp focused on structural economic and demographic issues. Spring 2019 Fellows at the Institute included Mayor Andrew Gillum, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, and Mayor Mitch Landrieu. While at Harvard, Cohn was the lead sponsor for the Road to 2092: Save Social Security, the first policy hackathon organized by the Harvard Institute of Politics. The competition featured over 250 students from 28 universities; the winning team presented their policy brief at the U.S. Capitol, the White House, and was also featured on MSNBC.

He also served as Texas Commissioner of the General Land Office and United States consul to Panama. Early life Thomas William Ward was born in Dublin to Henry and Frances Ward on June 20, 1807. His parents were Anglo-Irish Protestants. Thomas was baptized at St. Mary‚Äôs, a church associated with famous persons, including Richard Sheridan, John Wesley, Wolfe Tone, and Arthur Guinness.Humphrey (2009), pp. 7‚Äì8. Ward grew up in a large family in a prosperous neighborhood on Moore Street with four older siblings and five younger ones. His father Henry was a successful building contractor. He obtained a commission for construction at Botany Bay, a square at Trinity College. The building contract including the extension of an existing four- story building and adding a new four story-structure to the other side of the square. He started the project in 1813 and finished four years later.Humphrey (2009), pp. 9‚Äì11. Thomas trained as a carpenter and learned the business of contracting under the tutelage of his father. At age twenty, he moved with his family from Dublin to Rathvilly, County Carlow. In 1828 Ward sailed to Quebec before making his way to New Orleans. Though his obituary would later aver that he practiced as an architect and an engineer, his biographer dismisses this and says that he worked in New Orleans as a carpenter. In 1831 he was hired by a builder to work on a major expansion of house, including the addition of a kitchen, and a second story with a garret. This house was still extant at 709-711 Royal Street as recently as 2009.Humphrey (2009), pp. 13‚Äì15. Career =Military service= On October 13, 1835, Ward attended a meeting on Magazine Street organized by opposition to the regime of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. Among those recruiting volunteers for war against Mexico were Adolphus Sterne and Orazio de Santagelo. Enough volunteers signed up that night to create the New Orleans Greys, and Ward joined as a private. The first company embarked on a steamer to Texas via the Red River, and marched from north Texas to San Antonio de B√©xar. Ward embarked with his company on the schooner ‚Äò‚ÄôColumbus‚Äô‚Äô which navigated the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico to the mouth of the Brazos River, still about 250 miles short of the final destination of San Antonio. They boarded sixty-five soldiers and two cannon onto the steamer ‚Äô‚ÄôLaura‚Äô‚Äô, which took them upstream on the Brazos. This still left a substantial overland journey through Victoria and Goliad, where the company acquired horses. Once they reached San Antonio, they lingered for a few weeks, where they continued to train for an assault. Ward learned to fire the cannon and was promoted from private to lieutenant.Humphrey (2009), pp. 19‚Äì21. On December 5, the Texas forces launched an attack devised by Ben Milam. With a cannon sortie on the Alamo to distract the Mexican defenders east of the San Antonio River, the Texians‚Äô assaulted the town with two division from the north marching into San Antonio on parallel streets. Ward was attached to a force of seven companies led by Milam, and Francis Johnson was in command of the other group made up of eight infantry companies. The Texians assembled hours before sunrise. The artillery company attached to Milam‚Äôs command hauled two cannon. The feint started at 5 a.m. with the firing of a third cannon from another direction. The attackers stormed two houses near the main plaza to use for cover, but faced Mexican rifleman and seven artillery pieces. The two Texian cannons were targets for the counterattack, and Ward was hit by a cannon ball while defending the twelve-pound piece, shattering his right leg. The injury called urgently for amputation. Under primitive camp conditions, Albert Levy, the surgeon for the New Orleans Greys, sawed off Ward‚Äôs leg and wrapped the wound shut with excess muscle and skin. Survival rates for this type of operation were sixty percent under the best of conditions.Humphrey (2009), pp. 24‚Äì28. Ben Milam died from rifle fire during the assault and legend has it that Milam's body and Ward's leg were buried in the same grave. Ward‚Äôs biographer, David C. Humphrey, claims that this story is recorded for the first time in Texas: Her Resources and Her Public Men, published in 1858. This book included a brief biographical entry about Ward. In addition to the legend of Ward‚Äôs right leg, this is the source of the claims that Ward was an organizer of the Grays and that he was in command of his artillery unit. Humphrey disputes these characterizations. While recovering from the amputation, however, Ward traveled overland to Velasco and sailed for New Orleans. Eventually he healed enough and obtained a wooded prosthesis, and rejoined the military as a recruiter in April 1836.Humphrey (2009), 31‚Äì34. Commissioned as a colonel by President David G. Burnet, Ward served under Gen. Thomas J. Rusk. For his service to the Republic of Texas, Ward later received 2,240 acres in Grayson and Goliad counties. =Houston= After the Texas Revolution, Ward settled in Houston and worked as a general contractor. Augustus Allen, one of the founders of Houston, met with Ward in New Orleans early in 1837 to discuss construction projects. Ward secured a $4,000 letter of credit, and on February 18, 1837, Allen hired Ward as a contractor to build the Texas capitol in Houston. Allen also engaged Ward to build a smaller building known as the Long Row, which was to be used as a back up plan, and Ward completed this building in short order. According to one account, work did not commence until April 16th, just two weeks before Congress was due to meet on May 1st. When the Second Session of the 1st Congress of the Republic of Texas convened, the building was not yet finished, as reported by John James Audubon, \\"We amused ourselves by walking to the capitol, which was yet without a roof, and the floors, benches, and tables of both houses of Congress were as well saturated with water as our clothes had been in the morning.\\" Even though the Long Row was complete and the capitol building was not, Congress started its session in a building without a roof. Ward's capitol building was only used by the Texas government for a few years, but it was arguably one of Houston's finest buildings. For decades it was operated as a hotel, though extant photographs show the building after various renovations and expansions.Humphrey (2009), pp. 4346. In 1838, Ward started a law practice specializing in land grants and estates. He also acquired 8,000 acres of Texas land through grants related to his contributions to Texas independence. The same year Ward served as a member to the Harrisburg (Harris) County's Board of Land Commissioners. He lost his re-election bid the next year, and also unsuccessfully challenged Robert Wilson for a Texas Senate seat.Humphrey (2009), pp. 5051. During the spring and summer of 1839, the capitol was moved to Waterloo, later renamed Austin. Ward followed the seat of government and in late 1839 served as the chief clerk for the House of Representatives during the Fourth Congress. He went on to become the second mayor of Austin in the fall of 1840 when Edwin Waller stepped down. During his brief tenure in the winter of 1840, Ward created eight districts with a representative from each serving on the city council. He also coordinated the sale of town lots. =Austin= Ward agreed to serve as postmaster to the city of Houston in April 1839, just one day before the Texas government announced its plan to move the capital to Waterloo, later renamed as Austin. He remained on the job until October, but followed the Texas government to Austin around that time.Humphrey (2009), p. 54. Ward suffered another great personal tragedy on March 2, 1840 during a celebration of Texas Independence Day. He and a comrade from the New Orleans Greys, John D. McLeod, agreed to fire the old six-pound cannon as part of the day's festivities. The cannon fired by accident just as Ward was ramming the muzzle, causing severe damage to his right side. His right arm was amputated to save his life. After about month of bed rest, Ward was out in public, and by the end of the summer, the town of Austin elected him as its second mayor. Despite losing both a leg and an arm to cannon charges, he honored the re-election of Sam Houston in 1841 by firing another artillery piece.Humphrey (2009), pp. 5657. In January 1841 he was appointed the second commissioner of the General Land Office, succeeding John P. Borden. Ward presided over the land office until 1848. Throughout his term, he struggled to make sense of the often unclear and tangled land laws as well as the nightmare of conflicting surveys and untrained surveyors. The commissioner also had to combat rampant fraud and wrestle with dishonorable land speculators. Early on, Ward discovered that the job of land commissioner could be quite hazardous to one's health. In 1841 he lost his right arm when a cannon misfired during the official celebration of San Jacinto Day. The following year Ward was a party to the Texas Archive War. The Texas government evacuated to Houston in response to the Mexican invasion of Texas and the capture of San Antonio. Residents of Austin refused to release the government archives, and Ward worked with President Sam Houston to move the archives from Austin. For his trouble, Ward was among those fired upon by Angelina Eberly. During the state elections in 1848, George W. Smyth defeated Ward in the race for land commissioner. After his defeat, Ward served as the commissioner for overseeing land claims within the Peters Colony. In 1853 he was elected the 10th mayor of Austin but resigned in September to accept an appointment by President Franklin Pierce as United States consul to Panama. He returned to the United States in 1857 and, despite declining health, was nonetheless active in the election of 1860 as a bitter opponent of secession. In 1865 Andrew J. Hamilton appointed him mayor of Austin (19th), his third time to hold the post over a 25-year period. While he did serve as mayor of the capitol of Texas three time, he never completed one year in each of these terms. In October he left Austin to serve as Andrew Johnson's appointee as Corpus Christi's customs collector. He remained in this position until 1869 when Ulysses S. Grant fired him. Ward married Susan L. Marston, a widow with two children, on June 20, 1844. Three years later their home was built by the noted Austin architect, Abner H. Cook, on the corner of Hickory (now 8th Street) and Lavaca. This corner now houses the United States Court House, to be move the new Federal Court House in front of Republic Square. Death and legacy Ward contracted typhoid fever and died on November 25, 1872 in his Austin home. He is interred at the Texas State Cemetery, with a granite headstone marking the grave site which was commissioned by the State of Texas in 1932. He was buried with the honors of Masonry and Odd Fellowship in the Texas State Cemetery. On August 16, 1872, the first county seat of Johnson County was named Wardville in his honor. Ward County, Texas, created in 1887, was also named in his honor fifteen years after his death.

The Constitution of the State of New Jersey is the basic governing document of the State of New Jersey. In addition to three British Royal Charters issued for East Jersey, West Jersey and united New Jersey while they were still colonies, the state has been governed by three constitutions. The first was issued on July 2, 1776, shortly before New Jersey ratified the United States Declaration of Independence and the second was issued in 1844. The current document was issued in 1947 and has been amended several times. The state constitution reinforces the basic rights found in the United States Constitution, but also contains several unique provisions, such as regulations governing the operation of casinos. At 26,159 words,Number obtained through http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp . The number was determined with the Microsoft Word \\"Word Count\\" option. the document is slightly shorter than the average American state constitution (about 28,300 words).  Previous versions  Three fundamental documents had governed the territory now known as New Jersey. The first was the Concession and Agreement, which was written in 1665 by the colony's proprietors Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, and included a provision granting religious freedom. After Berkeley and Carteret sold New Jersey to the Quakers, the colony was split into West and East Jersey. Each had its own constitution: the West Jersey Constitution (1681) and the East Jersey Constitution (1683). The two were reunited in 1702 by Queen Anne. New Jersey's first state constitution was adopted on July 2, 1776. The American Revolutionary War was underway and George Washington had recently been defeated in New York, putting New Jersey in imminent danger of invasion. With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war. Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during this state of emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective was to provide a basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy. And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years. Among other provisions, it granted unmarried women and blacks who met property requirements the right to vote. It did not specify an amendment procedure and had to be replaced entirely in a constitutional convention. The succeeding constitution, adopted on June 29, 1844, restricted suffrage to white males. It separated the government's powers into judicial, legislative, and executive branches and granted the people (as opposed to the legislature) the ability to elect a governor. It also formally limited state debt, a predecessor of many contemporary \\"debt ceiling\\" clauses. The constitution was amended in 1875, mainly to conform to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Additionally, the state's amendments required that the legislature provide for a free public school system.  Current constitution (1947)  = Preamble = > We, the people of the State of New Jersey, grateful to Almighty God for the > civil and religious liberty which He hath so long permitted us to enjoy, and > looking to Him for a blessing upon our endeavors to secure and transmit the > same unimpaired to succeeding generations, do ordain and establish this > Constitution.Preamble = \\"Rights and Privileges\\" = Article I, as is usual for constitutions, establishes the rights and freedoms inherent people and relevant operation of the government. The rights discussed in this Article largely mirror the Constitution of the United States. Such rights include freedom of speech, a speedy and public trial, and religious freedom.Article I, Section I; first entry, Paragraph 6; second entry, Paragraph 9; third entry, Paragraphs 3 and 4 Article I also contains a Victims' Bill of Rights.Article I, Section I, Paragraph 22 The article is a de facto enumeration of the rights of the common man; Article I, Section I, Paragraph 21 deliberately states: This Article is similar to the U.S. Constitution's enumeration of rights. Similar to the U.S. Bill of Rights, the document also still has \\"holdover\\" rights, or rights left over from fear of Britain during the Revolutionary War. These passages still do guarantee important rights to New Jerseyans, but violations are not necessarily common. Such rights include: = \\"Elections and Suffrage\\" = The New Jersey Districts as of 2001. Article II lays out dates for elections of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and members of the New Jersey Legislature.Article II, Section I, Paragraphs 1 to 3 It establishes the qualifications necessary for voting and states the right of suffrage may be removed from certain convicted criminals. The process of absentee balloting is instituted, as well as the structure of voting by people currently in military service. The New Jersey Redistricting Commission is established, and the distribution of selection of its 13 members is discussed, who are to represent the \\"geographic, ethnic and racial diversity\\" of the state.Article II, Section II The method of appointment of New Jersey Redistricting Commission members ensures the minority party which lost the general election prior to the census will have the upper hand in redistricting the state. Along with the other 12 appointed members, there is one \\"independent\\" member, who is to not have held office within the past five years. He is chosen by the other twelve members, yet is automatically the chairman of the Commission. On the occasion that the twelve members may not reach a decision, the Commission picks two (which assumes there are two dominant parties which have their favorites) and sends them to the New Jersey Supreme Court. A majority of the court (4 of 7) then picks the one that \\"by education and occupational experience, by prior public service in government or otherwise, and by demonstrated ability to represent the best interest of the people of this State.\\" = \\"Distribution of the Powers of Government\\" = The sole content of Article III is the statement regarding separation of powers. The three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative) are created and defined. No individual can be affiliated with more than one unless the Constitution explicitly allows it.Article III Before the constitution was amended, a vacancy in the Governor of New Jersey would be filled by the president of the New Jersey Senate, who would retain their Senate seat. = \\"Legislative\\" = Article IV establishes the bicameral New Jersey Legislature, composed of 40 in the Senate and 80 in the General Assembly, and their apportionment amongst the state.Article IV, Section II The Apportionment Commission is created within the Legislature to modify the proration of legislative districts on a rolling basis, following every United States Census. It also creates the requirements for office, and the roles of the Senate and General Assembly. This includes the judging of elections, the selection of officers, a journal of proceedings, and the inability to adjourn for a period of greater than three days without the consent of the other house. This article also allows the Legislature to appoint commissions, committees, and other bodies to help perform the functions of the Legislature. Regulations regarding members of the Legislature, including singularity of employment. This is the law that no senator or member of the General Assembly can hold any other Federal or State position, and also cannot be a judge. Further topics are discussed, including bills, agencies, subdivisions, and emergencies. A negative enumeration of legislative powers is included within the article. Among this list of powers denied are granting divorces, gambling (with obvious exceptions), and passing omnibus acts.Article IV, Section VII Although the phrase omnibus acts is never formally used in this document, the actual wording skirts around the phrase: Finally, an oath/affirmation is included that is required by members and officers of the Legislature before the person enters upon his/her duties. = \\"Executive\\" = Chris Christie, the former governor of the state of New Jersey Article V enacts the executive branch.Article V, Section I, Paragraph 1. It also sets out the terms of office for the governor and lieutenant governor, the succession of future governors, and the process of gubernatorial elections. The Governor is given total authority over clemency except in cases of impeachment. This is to bar him from pardon in his own impeachment, or disturbing cases of treason. His clemency powers extend to the ability to suspend and remit fines and forfeitures. The system of granting parole is provided by law. The \\"militia\\" is created, or what is now the National Guard. Regulation regarding nominations and appointments of generals and flag offices is described. The executive and administrative offices, departments, and instrumentalities of the State government are placed under the supervision of the Governor. The Governor has the ability to appoint the Secretary of State and the Attorney General with the consent of the New Jersey Senate, though he also can appoint the Lieutenant Governor to serve as Secretary of State without consent of the Senate.Article IV, Section IV, Paragraph 3. He can also start inquiries into the conduct of officers and employees. = \\"Judicial\\" = Article VI creates the Judicial branch, and permits the establishment, alteration, and abolishment of any court other than the Supreme Court of New Jersey.Article VI, Sections I and II Under the State Constitution, \\"'judicial power shall be vested in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, County Courts and inferior courts of limited jurisdiction.'\\"Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 4:1-1 The Supreme Court is New Jersey's appellate court of last resort.Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:2-2 \\"By constitutional mandate, the Court consists of a Chief Justice and six associate justices, with five members constituting a quorum.\\" Article VI, Section II, Paragraph 3 provides that, \\"The Supreme Court makes its own rules governing the administration of all State courts 'and, subject to law, the practice and procedure of all such courts.'\\" The State Constitution renders the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division the intermediate appellate court, and \\"[a]ppeals may be taken to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court from the law and chancery divisions of the Superior Court and in such other causes as may be provided by law.\\"Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 7:1-1 \\"The trial divisions of the Superior Court are the principal trial courts of New Jersey. They are located within the State's various judicial geographic units, called 'vicinages,' R. 1:33-2(a), and are organized into two basic divisions: the Chancery Division and the Law Division\\" of the New Jersey Superior Court.Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:3-1 The Governor's power to appoint and nominate the judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts, with the consent of the Senate, is established. He may also nominate and appoint, with the consent of the Senate, judges of the inferior courts whose jurisdiction is only within one municipality. The term of office of Justices and Judges, including their retirement ages and pensions, is stated. Impeachment of Justices and Judges is also legalized, and their inabiling of powers until acquitted.Article VI, Section V, Paragraph 4 During their term, the judges are restricted to one public office and may not practice law outside the state government. The powers of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are enumerated. Terms specifying costs of the facilities and materials used by the Justice Department are listed. = \\"Public Officers and Employees\\" = Article VII involves the public officers and employees, including appointment/nomination, compensation, promotions, affirmations, and powers. The role of officers in the state government is discussed. Before the officer enters the duties of office, the officer must subscribe an oath.Article VII, Section I, Paragraph 1 Appointments for officers are based upon merit, fitness, and examinations. Fees are paid to the New Jersey State Treasury. The term of office for an officer commences on the day of the date of their commissions. The Auditor, who has a term of five years, is to be appointed by the New Jersey Senate and New Jersey General Assembly. The rest of the section details the duties of the State Auditor and the nomination/appointment of county prosecutors, county clerks, surrogates, and sheriffs. County prosecutors are nominated and appointed by the Governor. The term of office for county clerks and surrogates is five years, and for sheriffs three years. Impeachment and the process by which impeachment occurs are discussed:Article VII, Section III A state officer may be impeached while in office or for two years after leaving office.Article VII, Section III, Paragraph 1. The impeachment process is similar to that of the Federal level: an absolute majority in the lower house (the General Assembly) against the employee causes a trial to take place in the upper house (the State Senate) with the Chief Justice presiding. Unlike the Federal process, the oath necessary to participate in the impeachment sessions is specified and requires the senators to \\"truly and impartially\\" address the charge as a reminder that they are exercising more judicial functions. ‚Öî of the votes, or 27 votes, are needed to convict, but the President of the Senate is excluded from the trial, so the required percentage is slightly higher than ‚Öî of 40.Article VII, Section III, Paragraph 2 The maximum penalty is removal from office with disqualification to hold further state office. However, the impeachment does not count towards the restriction on double jeopardy; after being convicted by the senate, a person could then be tried by the judiciary and punished further.Article VII, Section III, Paragraph 3 If this crime was listed according to Article II, Section I, Item 7, the offender can be disenfranchised. = \\"Taxation and Finance\\" = In Article VIII, taxation is created. It states the Legislature's duty to create laws \\"to provide the value of land\\" and the uniformity of these rules.Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 1, (b) Taxing of lands of agriculture is discussed, as well as taxation regulations regarding the re-use of agricultural land for different purposes. Tax exemption is legalized,Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 2 including the continued tax exemptions carried over from the previous constitution. Alteration or repeal of tax exemption is allowed, provided that the real or personal property is not used for \\"religious, educational, charitable or cemetery purposes, as defined by law, and owned by any corporation or association organized and conducted exclusively for one or more of such purposes and not operating for profit.\\" Tax exemptions regarding the honorably discharged and exemptions for senior citizens who live in apartments and may/may not be disabled are discussed. Pensions, disability, and retirement programs for federal railroad workers, or any state employees are described. Surviving spouses of deceased citizens, besides exceptions, are entitled to tax deductions. This article also restricts any citizen from receiving more than one tax deduction. The Legislature's right to instantiating a homestead statue is discussed.Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 5 General laws enacted by legislature which permit municipalities to grant tax exemptions on buildings in blighted urban areas are legalized, with exceptions relating to the deduction's permanence. Income taxes are bannedArticle VIII, Section I, Paragraph 7 unless the revenue is placed into a specific perpetual fund, or if the taxer is receiving payments from the Federal Railroad Retirement Act, or similar. The credit of the state is barred from being publicly or privately loaned.Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 1 Any fiscal year plan which creates more than one percent debt and/or liabilities is banned. The voting on such plans in public elections is banned, as well as the creation of debt or liabilities \\"for purposes of war, or to repel invasion, or to suppress insurrection or to meet an emergency caused by disaster or act of God.\\" Taxation of motor vehicle fuel, and the funds the moneys are deposited in are discussed; the appropriation of moneys from the Sales and Use Tax Act are defined. A council of local mandates is created, and regulation regarding the appointment of the members for this body. Some moneys from the Corporate Business Tax Act are directed to the General Fund. The appropriation of moneys to the remediation of hazardous discharges and buildings that hold hazardous substances or public water supplies are discussed. A General Fund is created, as well as the distribution of moneys into and from it. The \\"clearance, replanning, development or redevelopment of blighted areas\\" is made a public and state duty.Article VIII, Section III, Paragraph 1 The redevelopment of any of these properties is permitted to be completed by municipal, public, or private corporations. The continuing of appropriation of moneys to the corporation that completes the redevelopment after its completion is banned. A free public school system is created, as well as a busing system.{Article VIII, Section IV The appropriation of moneys into the public school system fund is legalized. The lands that are tidal or were within forty years ago are protected from riparian claims. = \\"Amendments\\" = Article IX involves amendments to the New Jersey state constitution. A potential amendment is submitted through the Senate or General Assembly.Article IX, Section I, Paragraphs 1 and 2 The amendment is voted upon by both of the houses. If it gathers at least three-fifths of both the Senate and the General Assembly, the amendment is to be submitted to be voted upon by the people of New Jersey. If a majority votes for the amendment, the amendment is passed on the thirtieth day after the vote. It also explains how the amendments are submitted to the people, i.e., all amendments are to be voted upon separately.Article IX, Section I, Paragraphs 4 and 5 = \\"General Provisions\\" = Article X contains involves miscellaneous final addenda. Paragraph 1 states that \\"the seal of the State shall be kept by the Governor, or person administering the office of Governor, and used by him officially, and shall be called the Great Seal of the State of New Jersey.\\" The seal's design and the state flag are not mentioned. Paragraph 2 provides for the salutation and protocol of giving grants and commissions. Paragraph 3 states that \\"All writs shall be in the name of the State. All indictments shall conclude: \\"against the peace of this State, the government and dignity of the same.\\" Paragraph 4 provides for a rule of construction that words such as \\"person\\" and all pronouns include both sexes. Paragraph 5 provides that the effective date of the Constitution is January 1, 1948, \\"except as herein otherwise provided.\\" = \\"Schedule\\" = Article XI, the schedule, is the list of amendments to the Constitution in order of their addition. Sections I through IV, were adopted with the rest of the constitution. They lay out the process of supersession. The others were adopted as individual amendments. The Article orders the Legislature to pass all laws necessary for the activation of the new constitution.Article X, Section I, Paragraph 2 Existing instruments of government, contracts, officers, and judgments are continued unless they are expired, superseded, altered, or repealed. This is to prevent application as an ex post facto law or violation of the Contract Clause, both prohibited by the United States Constitution. The new legislature members are elected, and the process of election, term, and rotation are created. The members may be appointed to offices of government, likely new ones created at the behest of Article XI, Section I, Paragraph 2. The remaining sections are the amendments. For reasons unknown, this constitution has never been directly updated since its adoption. The amendments are enumerated in this Article. Essentially, this section of the article records the development of the constitution through amendments. Such amendments include the abolishment of the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals and Chancery,Article X, Section IV, Paragraph 3 transferring the cases before them and offices under the other courts, such as the New Jersey Supreme Court. The requirement of the Supreme Court of the United States that the apportionment of all state legislatures be by population is stated. It mainly consists of an interim list of districts and the number of Senators they can elect until the next United States Census comes around and is received by the Governor. It also contains provisions for apportioning ten districts of the lower house. If it is deadlocked, the Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court will appoint an 11th and then the vote is by absolute majority. It was passed on election day, 1966, but was first applied on January 17, 2006. This was superseded in 1995 by Article II, Section II. It took effect on December 7, 1978. Section VII, the final section of this constitution, was passed in a referendum on November 8, 2005, and takes full effect at noon, January 19, 2010, following the transfer of power to the next executive.  Criticisms  The New Jersey State Constitution has been criticized, mainly for its disorganized succession plan, as seen following Jim McGreevey's resignation. Senate President Richard Codey assumed command, and since he legally held both positions, he temporarily had more power than any other governor in the country, being the head of both Executive and Legislative branches. An amendment was later passed to prevent the possibility of Executive and Legislative conflation in the future. The constitution has also been denounced for its unorganized composition. Paragraphs traditionally in Article I, e.g., the banning of ex post facto laws, are in Article IV \\"Legislative.\\"  See also  *Law of New Jersey *John Farmer Jr., he served as Acting Governor of New Jersey for 90 minutes on January 8, 2002 *State constitution (United States) *Governors of New Jersey  Notes   References   External links  * Current Constitution on the State Legislature's site * Proceedings of the 1947 NJ Constitutional Convention * New Jersey State Treasury Category:Politics of New Jersey Category:New Jersey law New Jersey ","title":"Constitution of New Jersey"},{"id":"2427516","text":"View of the Institute Lapel pin of a graduate from Saint-Petersburg State Institute of Technology Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology (Technical University) () was founded in 1828.

Kelly (July 5, 1897 - July 6, 1963) was an Irish-American mayor of Buffalo, New York. He held the office from 1942 to 1945.  Early life  Joseph James Kelly was born in Buffalo, New York on July 5, 1897. His father was James W. Kelly, the founder of the American Body Company, and a local Democratic politician. Kelly served with a training unit in World War I and then entered the University at Buffalo Law School, graduating in 1920. He spent several years as a trial lawyer before being endorsed by the Democratic Party for a 1933 run for City Court. He was approached to run for mayor in 1937 but declined in favor of remaining on the bench. In 1940 Kelly was again approached with a request to run for mayor, this time accepting. The primary election was held on September 16, 1941 and Kelly defeated former Mayor Frank Schwab. William Fisher secured the Republican nomination.  Life as mayor  In an election held on November 5, 1941, Kelly defeated Fisher in a close race and was sworn in on December 31. Kelly's term was largely uneventful until January 2, 1945 when the city experienced what was called the worst storm in its history. When his term ended in 1945, Kelly opted not to run again, instead returning to private life.

The INC promptly filed a lawsuit claiming that the book was defamatory of its organization. The INC further claimed that the publication of Tipon's book will cause social unrest. For his part Tipon accused the INC of suppressing his rights to free speech. The Power and the Glory: The Cult of Manalo catalogued what he believed to be the INC's un-biblical doctrines. Critics of the INC believe members of the INC and the public should be free to study educated criticisms directed at any doctrine of any religious group in the spirit of the free speech and religious freedom.

They are particularly useful for explaining complex hierarchies and overlapping definitions. They are similar to another set diagramming technique, Venn diagrams. Unlike Venn diagrams, which show all possible relations between different sets, the Euler diagram shows only relevant relationships. The first use of \\"Eulerian circles\\" is commonly attributed to Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707‚Äì1783). In the United States, both Venn and Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement of the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading as well as organizations and businesses. Euler diagrams consist of simple closed shapes in a two dimensional plane that each depict a set or category. How or if these shapes overlap demonstrates the relationships between the sets. Each curve divides the plane into two regions or \\"zones\\": the interior, which symbolically represents the elements of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set. Curves that do not overlap represent disjoint sets, which have no elements in common. Two curves that overlap represent sets that intersect, that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the intersection of the sets). A curve completely within the interior of another is a subset of it. Venn diagrams are a more restrictive form of Euler diagrams. A Venn diagram must contain all 2n logically possible zones of overlap between its n curves, representing all combinations of inclusion/exclusion of its constituent sets. Regions not part of the set are indicated by coloring them black, in contrast to Euler diagrams, where membership in the set is indicated by overlap as well as color.  History  A page from Hamilton's Lectures on Logic. The symbolism A, E, I, and O refer to the categorical statements that can occur in a syllogism. The small text to the left erroneously states: \\"The first employment of circular diagrams in logic improperly ascribed to Euler. To be found in Christian Weise\\", a book actually written by Johann Christian Lange. On the right is page 74 from Couturat 1914 wherein he labels the 8 regions of the Venn diagram. The modern name for these \\"regions\\" is minterms. These are shown on the left with the variables x, y and z per Venn's drawing. The symbolism is as follows: logical AND ( & ) is represented by arithmetic multiplication, and the logical NOT ( ~ )is represented by \\" ' \\" after the variable, e.g. the region x'y'z is read as \\"NOT x AND NOT y AND z\\" i.e. ~x & ~y & z. Both the Veitch diagram and Karnaugh map show all the minterms, but the Veitch is not particularly useful for reduction of formulas. Observe the strong resemblance between the Venn and Karnaugh diagrams; the colors and the variables x, y, and z are per Venn's example. As shown in the illustration to the right, Sir William Hamilton in his posthumously published Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic (1858‚Äì60) erroneously asserts that the original use of circles to \\"sensualize ... the abstractions of Logic\\" (p. 180) was not Leonhard Paul Euler (1707‚Äì1783) but rather Christian Weise (1642‚Äì1708) in his Nucleus Logicae Weisianae that appeared in 1712 posthumously, however, the latter book was actually written by Johann Christian Lange rather than Weise. He references Euler's Letters to a German Princess [Partie II, Lettre XXXV, February 17, 1791, ed. Cournot (1842), pp. 412-417. ‚Äì ED.]By the time these lectures of Hamilton were published, Hamilton too had died. His editors (symbolized by ED.), responsible for most of the footnoting, were the logicians Henry Longueville Mansel and John Veitch. In Hamilton's illustration the four categorical propositions that can occur in a syllogism as symbolized by the drawings A, E, I and O are:Hamilton 1860:179. The examples are from Jevons 1881:71ff. * A: The Universal Affirmative, Example: \\"All metals are elements\\". * E: The Universal Negative, Example: \\"No metals are compound substances\\". * I: The Particular Affirmative, Example: \\"Some metals are brittle\\". * O: The Particular Negative, Example: \\"Some metals are not brittle\\". In his 1881 Symbolic Logic Chapter V \\"Diagrammatic Representation\\", John Venn (1834‚Äì1923) comments on the remarkable prevalence of the Euler diagram: : \\"...of the first sixty logical treatises, published during the last century or so, which were consulted for this purpose:-somewhat at random, as they happened to be most accessible :-it appeared that thirty four appealed to the aid of diagrams, nearly all of these making use of the Eulerian Scheme.\\" (Footnote 1 page 100) Composite of two pages 115‚Äì116 from Venn 1881 showing his example of how to convert a syllogism of three parts into his type of diagram. Venn calls the circles \\"Eulerian circles\\" (cf Sandifer 2003, Venn 1881:114 etc) in the \\"Eulerian scheme\\" (Venn 1881:100) of \\"old-fashioned Eulerian diagrams\\" (Venn 1881:113). But nevertheless, he contended, \\"the inapplicability of this scheme for the purposes of a really general Logic\\" (page 100) and on page 101 observed that, \\"It fits in but badly even with the four propositions of the common Logic to which it is normally applied.\\" Venn ends his chapter with the observation illustrated in the examples below‚Äîthat their use is based on practice and intuition, not on a strict algorithmic practice: :‚ÄúIn fact ... those diagrams not only do not fit in with the ordinary scheme of propositions which they are employed to illustrate, but do not seem to have any recognized scheme of propositions to which they could be consistently affiliated.‚Äù (pp. 124‚Äì125) Finally, in his Chapter XX HISTORIC NOTES Venn gets to a crucial criticism (italicized in the quote below); observe in Hamilton's illustration that the O (Particular Negative) and I (Particular Affirmative) are simply rotated: :\\"We now come to Euler's well-known circles which were first described in his Lettres a une Princesse d'Allemagne (Letters 102‚Äì105). The weak point about these consists in the fact that they only illustrate in strictness the actual relations of classes to one another, rather than the imperfect knowledge of these relations which we may possess, or wish to convey, by means of the proposition. Accordingly they will not fit in with the propositions of common logic, but demand the constitution of a new group of appropriate elementary propositions.... This defect must have been noticed from the first in the case of the particular affirmative and negative, for the same diagram is commonly employed to stand for them both, which it does indifferently well\\". (italics added: page 424) (Sandifer 2003 reports that Euler makes such observations too; Euler reports that his figure 45 (a simple intersection of two circles) has 4 different interpretations). Whatever the case, armed with these observations and criticisms, Venn then demonstrates (pp. 100‚Äì125) how he derived what has become known as his Venn diagrams from the \\"...old-fashioned Euler diagrams.\\" In particular he gives an example, shown on the left. By 1914, Louis Couturat (1868‚Äì1914) had labeled the terms as shown on the drawing on the right. Moreover, he had labeled the exterior region (shown as a'b'c') as well. He succinctly explains how to use the diagram ‚Äì one must strike out the regions that are to vanish: :\\"VENN'S method is translated in geometrical diagrams which represent all the constituents, so that, in order to obtain the result, we need only strike out (by shading) those which are made to vanish by the data of the problem.\\" (italics added p. 73) Given the Venn's assignments, then, the unshaded areas inside the circles can be summed to yield the following equation for Venn's example: : \\"No Y is Z and ALL X is Y: therefore No X is Z\\" has the equation x'yz' + xyz' + x'y'z for the unshaded area inside the circles (but this is not entirely correct; see the next paragraph). In Venn the 0th term, x'y'z', i.e. the background surrounding the circles, does not appear. Nowhere is it discussed or labeled, but Couturat corrects this in his drawing. The correct equation must include this unshaded area shown in boldface: : \\"No Y is Z and ALL X is Y: therefore No X is Z\\" has the equation x'yz' + xyz' + x'y'z + x'y'z' . In modern usage the Venn diagram includes a \\"box\\" that surrounds all the circles; this is called the universe of discourse or the domain of discourse. Couturat now observes that, in a direct algorithmic (formal, systematic) manner, one cannot derive reduced Boolean equations, nor does it show how to arrive at the conclusion \\"No X is Z\\". Couturat concluded that the process \\"has ... serious inconveniences as a method for solving logical problems\\": :\\"It does not show how the data are exhibited by canceling certain constituents, nor does it show how to combine the remaining constituents so as to obtain the consequences sought. In short, it serves only to exhibit one single step in the argument, namely the equation of the problem; it dispenses neither with the previous steps, i. e., \\"throwing of the problem into an equation\\" and the transformation of the premises, nor with the subsequent steps, i. e., the combinations that lead to the various consequences. Hence it is of very little use, inasmuch as the constituents can be represented by algebraic symbols quite as well as by plane regions, and are much easier to deal with in this form.\\"(p. 75) Thus the matter would rest until 1952 when Maurice Karnaugh (1924‚Äì ) would adapt and expand a method proposed by Edward W. Veitch; this work would rely on the truth table method precisely defined in Emil Post's 1921 PhD thesis \\"Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions\\" and the application of propositional logic to switching logic by (among others) Claude Shannon, George Stibitz, and Alan Turing.See footnote at George Stibitz. For example, in chapter \\"Boolean Algebra\\", Hill and Peterson (1968, 1964) present sections 4.5ff \\"Set Theory as an Example of Boolean Algebra\\", and in it they present the Venn diagram with shading and all. They give examples of Venn diagrams to solve example switching-circuit problems, but end up with this statement: ::\\"For more than three variables, the basic illustrative form of the Venn diagram is inadequate. Extensions are possible, however, the most convenient of which is the Karnaugh map, to be discussed in Chapter 6.\\" (p. 64) In Chapter 6, section 6.4 \\"Karnaugh Map Representation of Boolean Functions\\" they begin with: ::\\"The Karnaugh map1 [1Karnaugh 1953] is one of the most powerful tools in the repertory of the logic designer. ... A Karnaugh map may be regarded either as a pictorial form of a truth table or as an extension of the Venn diagram.\\" (pp. 103‚Äì104) The history of Karnaugh's development of his \\"chart\\" or \\"map\\" method is obscure. Karnaugh in his 1953 referenced Veitch 1951, Veitch referenced Claude E. Shannon 1938 (essentially Shannon's Master's thesis at M.I.T.), and Shannon in turn referenced, among other authors of logic texts, Couturat 1914. In Veitch's method the variables are arranged in a rectangle or square; as described in Karnaugh map, Karnaugh in his method changed the order of the variables to correspond to what has become known as (the vertices of) a hypercube.  Relation between Euler and Venn diagrams  Examples of small Venn diagrams (on left) with shaded regions representing empty sets, showing how they can be easily transformed into equivalent Euler diagrams (right) Venn diagrams are a more restrictive form of Euler diagrams. A Venn diagram must contain all 2n logically possible zones of overlap between its n curves, representing all combinations of inclusion/exclusion of its constituent sets. Regions not part of the set are indicated by coloring them black, in contrast to Euler diagrams, where membership in the set is indicated by overlap as well as color. When the number of sets grows beyond 3 a Venn diagram becomes visually complex, especially compared to the corresponding Euler diagram. The difference between Euler and Venn diagrams can be seen in the following example. Take the three sets: * A = \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\, 2,\\\\, 5\\\\\\\\} * B = \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\, 6\\\\\\\\} * C = \\\\\\\\{4,\\\\, 7\\\\\\\\} The Euler and the Venn diagrams of those sets are: File:3-set Euler diagram.svgEuler diagram File:3-set Venn diagram.svgVenn diagram In a logical setting, one can use model theoretic semantics to interpret Euler diagrams, within a universe of discourse. In the examples below, the Euler diagram depicts that the sets Animal and Mineral are disjoint since the corresponding curves are disjoint, and also that the set Four Legs is a subset of the set of Animals. The Venn diagram, which uses the same categories of Animal, Mineral, and Four Legs, does not encapsulate these relationships. Traditionally the emptiness of a set in Venn diagrams is depicted by shading in the region. Euler diagrams represent emptiness either by shading or by the absence of a region. Often a set of well-formedness conditions are imposed; these are topological or geometric constraints imposed on the structure of the diagram. For example, connectedness of zones might be enforced, or concurrency of curves or multiple points might be banned, as might tangential intersection of curves. In the adjacent diagram, examples of small Venn diagrams are transformed into Euler diagrams by sequences of transformations; some of the intermediate diagrams have concurrency of curves. However, this sort of transformation of a Venn diagram with shading into an Euler diagram without shading is not always possible. There are examples of Euler diagrams with 9 sets that are not drawable using simple closed curves without the creation of unwanted zones since they would have to have non-planar dual graphs. = Example: Euler- to Venn-diagram and Karnaugh map = This example shows the Euler and Venn diagrams and Karnaugh map deriving and verifying the deduction \\"No Xs are Zs\\". In the illustration and table the following logical symbols are used: * 1 can be read as \\"true\\", 0 as \\"false\\" * ~ for NOT and abbreviated to ' when illustrating the minterms e.g. x' =defined NOT x, * + for Boolean OR (from Boolean algebra: 0+0=0, 0+1 = 1+0 = 1, 1+1=1) * & (logical AND) between propositions; in the mintems AND is omitted in a manner similar to arithmetic multiplication: e.g. x'y'z =defined ~x & ~y & z (From Boolean algebra: 0*0=0, 0*1 = 1*0=0, 1*1 = 1, where * is shown for clarity) * ‚Üí (logical IMPLICATION): read as IF ... THEN ..., or \\" IMPLIES \\", P ‚Üí Q =defined NOT P OR Q Before it can be presented in a Venn diagram or Karnaugh Map, the Euler diagram's syllogism \\"No Y is Z, All X is Y\\" must first be reworded into the more formal language of the propositional calculus: \\" 'It is not the case that: AND AND 'If an then a \\". Once the propositions are reduced to symbols and a propositional formula ( ~(y & z) & (x ‚Üí y) ), one can construct the formula's truth table; from this table the Venn and/or the Karnaugh map are readily produced. By use of the adjacency of \\"1\\"s in the Karnaugh map (indicated by the grey ovals around terms 0 and 1 and around terms 2 and 6) one can \\"reduce\\" the example's Boolean equation i.e. (x'y'z' + x'y'z) + (x'yz' + xyz') to just two terms: x'y' + yz'. But the means for deducing the notion that \\"No X is Z\\", and just how the reduction relates to this deduction, is not forthcoming from this example. Given a proposed conclusion such as \\"No X is a Z\\", one can test whether or not it is a correct deduction by use of a truth table. The easiest method is put the starting formula on the left (abbreviate it as P) and put the (possible) deduction on the right (abbreviate it as Q) and connect the two with logical implication i.e. P ‚Üí Q, read as IF P THEN Q. If the evaluation of the truth table produces all 1s under the implication-sign (‚Üí, the so-called major connective) then P ‚Üí Q is a tautology. Given this fact, one can \\"detach\\" the formula on the right (abbreviated as Q) in the manner described below the truth table. Given the example above, the formula for the Euler and Venn diagrams is: : \\"No Ys are Zs\\" and \\"All Xs are Ys\\": ( ~(y & z) & (x ‚Üí y) ) =defined P And the proposed deduction is: : \\"No Xs are Zs\\": ( ~ (x & z) ) =defined Q So now the formula to be evaluated can be abbreviated to: : ( ~(y & z) & (x ‚Üí y) ) ‚Üí ( ~ (x & z) ): P ‚Üí Q : IF ( \\"No Ys are Zs\\" and \\"All Xs are Ys\\" ) THEN ( \\"No Xs are Zs\\" ) { style=\\"width:auto; border:1px solid darkgray; border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text- align:center\\" + The Truth Table demonstrates that the formula ( ~(y & z) & (x ‚Üí y) ) ‚Üí ( ~ (x & z) ) is a tautology as shown by all 1s in yellow column. - !

But given the demonstration that P ‚Üí Q is tautology, the stage is now set for the use of the procedure of modus ponens to \\"detach\\" Q: \\"No Xs are Zs\\" and dispense with the terms on the left.This is a sophisticated concept. Russell and Whitehead (2nd edition 1927) in their Principia Mathematica describe it this way: \\"The trust in inference is the belief that if the two former assertions [the premises P, P‚ÜíQ ] are not in error, the final assertion is not in error . . . An inference is the dropping of a true premiss [sic]; it is the dissolution of an implication\\" (p. 9). Further discussion of this appears in \\"Primitive Ideas and Propositions\\" as the first of their \\"primitive propositions\\" (axioms): *1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true\\" (p. 94). In a footnote the authors refer the reader back to Russell's 1903 Principles of Mathematics ¬ß38. Modus ponens (or \\"the fundamental rule of inference\\"cf Reichenbach 1947:64) is often written as follows: The two terms on the left, P ‚Üí Q and P, are called premises (by convention linked by a comma), the symbol ‚ä¢ means \\"yields\\" (in the sense of logical deduction), and the term on the right is called the conclusion: : P ‚Üí Q, P ‚ä¢ Q For the modus ponens to succeed, both premises P ‚Üí Q and P must be true. Because, as demonstrated above the premise P ‚Üí Q is a tautology, \\"truth\\" is always the case no matter how x, y and z are valued, but \\"truth\\" is only the case for P in those circumstances when P evaluates as \\"true\\" (e.g. rows OR OR OR : x'y'z' + x'y'z + x'yz' + xyz' = x'y' + yz').Reichenbach discusses the fact that the implication P ‚Üí Q need not be a tautology (a so-called \\"tautological implication\\"). Even \\"simple\\" implication (connective or adjunctive) work, but only for those rows of the truth table that evaluate as true, cf Reichenbach 1947:64‚Äì66. : P ‚Üí Q , P ‚ä¢ Q :* i.e.: ( ~(y & z) & (x ‚Üí y) ) ‚Üí ( ~ (x & z) ) , ( ~(y & z) & (x ‚Üí y) ) ‚ä¢ ( ~ (x & z) ) :* i.e.: IF \\"No Ys are Zs\\" and \\"All Xs are Ys\\" THEN \\"No Xs are Zs\\", \\"No Ys are Zs\\" and \\"All Xs are Ys\\" ‚ä¢ \\"No Xs are Zs\\" One is now free to \\"detach\\" the conclusion \\"No Xs are Zs\\", perhaps to use it in a subsequent deduction (or as a topic of conversation). The use of tautological implication means that other possible deductions exist besides \\"No Xs are Zs\\"; the criterion for a successful deduction is that the 1s under the sub-major connective on the right include all the 1s under the sub-major connective on the left (the major connective being the implication that results in the tautology). For example, in the truth table, on the right side of the implication (‚Üí, the major connective symbol) the bold-face column under the sub-major connective symbol \\" ~ \\" has the all the same 1s that appear in the bold-faced column under the left-side sub-major connective & (rows , , and ), plus two more (rows and ).

It fused Queen's rock music with rap vocals and many sound bites from movies (such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off) and other sources. Unlike 1992's cancelled BASIC Queen Bootlegs album and despite its title, it is considered a bastard pop album rather than a hip-hop album. On November 8, 2004, Waxy, the main site that hosted A Night At The Hip Hopera, received a cease & desist notice from the Walt Disney Company (Hollywood Records) for illegal sampling of songs by Queen, similar to the banning of DJ Danger Mouse's The Grey Album.

It was originally released on Double Fantasy, her joint album with John Lennon, as well as on the B-side of his \\"(Just Like) Starting Over\\" single. The disco and new wave- influenced song features Ono gasping heavily and appearing to reach orgasm. In Lennon and Ono's joint 1980 interview with Playboy, Ono said: :John is saying in his song [Starting Over], OK, we had the energy in the Sixties, in the Seventies we separated, but let's start over in the Eighties. He's reaching out to me, the woman. Reaching out after all that's happened, over the battlefield of dead families, is more difficult this time around. On the other side of the record is my song, \\"Kiss Kiss Kiss,\\" which is the other side of the same question. There is the sound of a woman coming to a climax on it, and she is crying out to be held, to be touched. It will be controversial, because people still feel it's less natural to hear the sounds of a woman's lovemaking than, say, the sound of a Concorde, killing the atmosphere and polluting nature.

Due to the consistent vibration induced from thermal energy, they are permanently deviating from their equilibrium position. Elastic waves of different lengths, frequencies, and amplitudes run through crystalline solids at all times. The frequencies are typically of the order of 1013 Hz, and the amplitudes are typically of the order of 10‚àí11 m. Materials The process of the atomic vibrations is important for materials of different classes: for metallic, covalent, ionic crystals, semiconductors, intermetallic compounds, interstitial phases. The amplitude-frequency characteristics of the vibrating spectrum of an alloy can be varied, for example by alloying, to produce a well-directed effect on the properties of the materials. Description The phenomena of atomic vibrations reflecting the interaction of micro-particles with each other depend on the deep properties of the medium. The vibrational amplitude and the vibrational spectrum are determined by interatomic bonds. Measurement The basic tool for the measurement of the mean-square amplitude of vibrations is X-ray diffraction. The heat vibrational motion of atoms, affecting the atom displacements, results in a weakening of diffracted lines (reflections). By measuring the intensity of the same reflections at two temperatures (for example, at a room and a high temperature) one can calculate mean-square amplitudes of the atom vibrations. The amplitude of atomic vibrations depend on temperature of conductor. At higher temperature, atoms vibrate with larger amplitudes and hence motion of electrons is largely opposed due to more frequent collisions. This increases resistance of conductor. Correct data about the frequency spectrum is provided with the help of the technique of the neutron scattering by solids.

This decomposition is of fundamental importance in Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometry. Definition of the decomposition Let (M,g) be a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian n-manifold. Consider its Riemann curvature, as a (0,4)-tensor field. This article will follow the sign convention :R_{ijkl}=g_{lp}\\\\Big(\\\\partial_i\\\\Gamma_{jk}^p-\\\\partial_j\\\\Gamma_{ik}^p+\\\\Gamma_{iq}^p\\\\Gamma_{jk}^q-\\\\Gamma_{jq}^p\\\\Gamma_{ik}^q\\\\Big); written multilinearly, this is the convention :\\\\operatorname{Rm}(W,X,Y,Z)=g\\\\Big( abla_W abla_XY- abla_X abla_WY- abla_{[W,X]}Y,Z\\\\Big). With this convention, the Ricci tensor is a (0,2)-tensor field defined by Rjk=gilRijkl and the scalar curvature is defined by R=gjkRjk. Define the traceless Ricci tensor :Z_{jk}=R_{jk}-\\\\frac{1}{n}Rg_{jk}, and then define three (0,4)-tensor fields S, E, and W by :\\\\begin{align} S_{ijkl}&=\\\\frac{R}{n(n-1)}\\\\big(g_{il}g_{jk}-g_{ik}g_{jl}\\\\big) E_{ijkl}&=\\\\frac{1}{n-2}\\\\big(Z_{il}g_{jk}-Z_{jl}g_{ik}-Z_{ik}g_{jl}+Z_{jk}g_{il}\\\\big) W_{ijkl}&=R_{ijkl}-S_{ijkl}-E_{ijkl}. \\\\end{align} The \\"Ricci decomposition\\" is the statement :R_{ijkl}=S_{ijkl}+E_{ijkl}+W_{ijkl}. As stated, this is vacuous since it is just a reorganization of the definition of W. The importance of the decomposition is in the properties of the three new tensors S, E, and W. Terminological note. The tensor W is called the Weyl tensor. The notation W is standard in mathematics literature, while C is more common in physics literature. The notation R is standard in both, while there is no standardized notation for S, Z, and E. Basic properties =Properties of the pieces= Each of the tensors S, E, and W has the same algebraic symmetries as the Riemann tensor. That is: :\\\\begin{align} S_{ijkl}&=-S_{jikl}=-S_{ijlk}=S_{klij} E_{ijkl}&=-E_{jikl}=-E_{ijlk}=E_{klij} W_{ijkl}&=-W_{jikl}=-W_{ijlk}=W_{klij} \\\\end{align} together with :\\\\begin{align} S_{ijkl}+S_{jkil}+S_{kijl}&=0 E_{ijkl}+E_{jkil}+E_{kijl}&=0 W_{ijkl}+W_{jkil}+W_{kijl}&=0. \\\\end{align} The Weyl tensor has the additional symmetry that it is completely traceless: :g^{il}W_{ijkl}=0. Hermann Weyl showed that W has the remarkable property of measuring the deviation of a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold from local conformal flatness; if it is zero, then M can be covered by charts relative to which g has the form gij=efŒ¥ij for some function f defined chart by chart. =Properties of the decomposition= One may check that the Ricci decomposition is orthogonal in the sense that :S_{ijkl}E^{ijkl}=S_{ijkl}W^{ijkl}=E_{ijkl}W^{ijkl}=0, recalling the general definition T^{ijkl}=g^{ip}g^{jq}g^{kr}g^{ls}T_{pqrs}. This has the consequence, which could be proved directly, that :R_{ijkl}R^{ijkl}=S_{ijkl}S^{ijkl}+E_{ijkl}E^{ijkl}+W_{ijkl}W^{ijkl}. Terminological note. It would be symbolically clean to present this orthogonality as saying :\\\\langle S,E\\\\rangle_g=\\\\langle S,W\\\\rangle_g=\\\\langle E,W\\\\rangle_g=0, together with :\\\\operatorname{Rm}_g^2=S_g^2+E_g^2+W_g^2. However, there is an unavoidable ambiguity with such notation depending on whether one views \\\\operatorname{Rm},S,E,W as multilinear maps T_pM\\\\times T_pM\\\\times T_pM\\\\times T_pM\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} or as linear maps \\\\wedge^2T_pM\\\\to\\\\wedge^2T_pM, in which case the corresponding norms and inner products would differ by a constant factor. Although this would not lead to any inconsistencies in the above equations, since all terms would be changed by the same factor, it can lead to confusion in more involved contexts. For this reason, the index notation can often be easier to understand. Related formulas One can compute the \\"norm formulas\\" :\\\\begin{align} S_{ijkl}S^{ijkl}&=\\\\frac{2R^2}{n(n-1)} E_{ijkl}E^{ijkl}&=\\\\frac{4R_{ij}R^{ij}}{n-2}-\\\\frac{4R^2}{n(n-2)} W_{ijkl}W^{ijkl}&=R_{ijkl}R^{ijkl}-\\\\frac{4R_{ij}R^{ij}}{n-2}+\\\\frac{2R^2}{(n-1)(n-2)} \\\\end{align} and the \\"trace formulas\\" :\\\\begin{align} g^{il}S_{ijkl}&=\\\\frac{1}{n}Rg_{jk} g^{il}E_{ijkl}&=R_{jk}-\\\\frac{1}{n}Rg_{jk} g^{il}W_{ijkl}&=0. \\\\end{align} Mathematical explanation of the decomposition Mathematically, the Ricci decomposition is the decomposition of the space of all tensors having the symmetries of the Riemann tensor into its irreducible representations for the action of the orthogonal group . Let V be an n-dimensional vector space, equipped with a metric tensor (of possibly mixed signature). Here V is modeled on the cotangent space at a point, so that a curvature tensor R (with all indices lowered) is an element of the tensor product V‚äóV‚äóV‚äóV. The curvature tensor is skew symmetric in its first and last two entries: :R(x,y,z,w)=-R(y,x,z,w)=-R(x,y,w,z)\\\\, and obeys the interchange symmetry :R(x,y,z,w) = R(z,w,x,y),\\\\, for all x,y,z,w ‚àà V‚àó. As a result, R is an element of the subspace S^2\\\\Lambda^2 V , the second symmetric power of the second exterior power of V. A curvature tensor must also satisfy the Bianchi identity, meaning that it is in the kernel of the linear map b: S^2\\\\Lambda^2 V \\\\to \\\\Lambda^4 V given by :b(R)(x,y,z,w) = R(x,y,z,w) + R(y,z,x,w) + R(z,x,y,w).\\\\, The space in S2Œõ2V is the space of algebraic curvature tensors. The Ricci decomposition is the decomposition of this space into irreducible factors. The Ricci contraction mapping :c : S^2\\\\Lambda^2 V \\\\to S^2V is given by :c(R)(x,y) = \\\\operatorname{tr}R(x,\\\\cdot,y,\\\\cdot). This associates a symmetric 2-form to an algebraic curvature tensor. Conversely, given a pair of symmetric 2-forms h and k, the Kulkarni‚ÄìNomizu product of h and k :(h {~\\\\wedge\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\bigcirc~} k)(x,y,z,w) = h(x,z)k(y,w)+h(y,w)k(x,z) -h(x,w)k(y,z)-h(y,z)k(x,w) produces an algebraic curvature tensor. If n > 4, then there is an orthogonal decomposition into (unique) irreducible subspaces : where :\\\\mathbf{S}V = \\\\mathbb{R} g {~\\\\wedge\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\bigcirc~} g, where \\\\mathbb{R} is the space of real scalars :\\\\mathbf{E}V = g {~\\\\wedge\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\bigcirc~} S^2_0V, where S'V is the space of trace- free symmetric 2-forms :\\\\mathbf{C}V = \\\\ker c \\\\cap \\\\ker b. The parts S, E, and C of the Ricci decomposition of a given Riemann tensor R are the orthogonal projections of R onto these invariant factors. In particular, :R = S + E + C is an orthogonal decomposition in the sense that :R^2 = S^2 + E^2 + C^2. This decomposition expresses the space of tensors with Riemann symmetries as a direct sum of the scalar submodule, the Ricci submodule, and Weyl submodule, respectively. Each of these modules is an irreducible representation for the orthogonal group , and thus the Ricci decomposition is a special case of the splitting of a module for a semisimple Lie group into its irreducible factors. In dimension 4, the Weyl module decomposes further into a pair of irreducible factors for the special orthogonal group: the self- dual and antiself-dual parts W+ and W‚àí. Physical interpretation The Ricci decomposition can be interpreted physically in Einstein's theory of general relativity, where it is sometimes called the G√©h√©niau-Debever decomposition. In this theory, the Einstein field equation : G_{ab} = 8 \\\\pi \\\\, T_{ab} where T_{ab} is the stress‚Äìenergy tensor describing the amount and motion of all matter and all nongravitational field energy and momentum, states that the Ricci tensor‚Äîor equivalently, the Einstein tensor‚Äîrepresents that part of the gravitational field which is due to the immediate presence of nongravitational energy and momentum. The Weyl tensor represents the part of the gravitational field which can propagate as a gravitational wave through a region containing no matter or nongravitational fields. Regions of spacetime in which the Weyl tensor vanishes contain no gravitational radiation and are also conformally flat.

It is \\"a deep study of life in the city of Florence from an intellectual, artistic, religious, and social point of view\\". The story takes place amidst actual historical events during the Italian Renaissance, and includes in its plot several notable figures from Florentine history. The novel first appeared in fourteen parts published in Cornhill Magazine from July 1862 (vol. 6, no. 31) to August 1863 (vol. 8, no. 44), and was first published as a book, in three volumes, by Smith, Elder & Co. in 1863.  Plot summary  Florence, 1492: Christopher Columbus has sailed towards the New World, and Florence has just mourned the death of its leader, Lorenzo de' Medici. In this setting, a Florentine trader meets a shipwrecked stranger, who introduces himself as Tito Melema, a young Italianate-Greek scholar. Tito becomes acquainted with several other Florentines, including Nello the barber and a young girl named Tessa. He is also introduced to a blind scholar named Bardo de' Bardi, and his daughter Romola. As Tito becomes settled in Florence, assisting Bardo with classical studies, he falls in love with Romola. However, Tessa falls in love with Tito, and the two are \\"married\\" in a mock ceremony. Tito learns from Fra Luca, a Dominican friar, that his adoptive father has been forced into slavery and is asking for assistance. Tito introspects, comparing filial duty to his new ambitions in Florence, and decides that it would be futile to attempt to rescue his adoptive father. This paves the way for Romola and Tito to marry. Fra Luca shortly thereafter falls ill and before his death he speaks to his estranged sister, Romola. Ignorant of Romola's plans, Fra Luca warns her of a vision foretelling a marriage between her and a mysterious stranger who will bring pain to her and her father. After Fra Luca's death, Tito dismisses the warning and advises Romola to trust him. Tito and Romola become betrothed at the end of Carnival, to be married at Easter after Tito returns from a visit to Rome. The novel then skips ahead to November 1494, more than eighteen months after the marriage. In that time, the French-Italian Wars have seen Florence enter uneasy times. Girolamo Savonarola preaches to Florentines about ridding the Church and the city of scourge and corruption, and drums up support for the new republican government. Piero de' Medici, Lorenzo de' Medici's son and successor to the lordship of Florence, has been driven from the city for his ignominious surrender to the invading French king, Charles VIII. The Medici palace is looted and the Medici family formally exiled from the city. In this setting, Tito, now a valued member of Florentine society, participates in the reception for the French invaders. Tito encounters an escaped prisoner, who turns out to be his adopted father, Baldassarre. Panicked and somewhat ashamed of his earlier inaction, Tito denies knowing the escaped prisoner and calls him a madman. Baldassarre escapes into the Duomo, where he swears revenge on his unfilial adoptive son. Growing ever more fearful, Tito plans to leave Florence. To do this, he betrays his late father- in-law, Bardo, who died some months earlier, by selling the late scholar's library. This reveals to Romola the true nature of her husband's character. She secretly leaves Tito and Florence, but is persuaded by Savonarola to return to fulfil her obligations to her marriage and her fellow Florentines. Nevertheless, the love between Romola and Tito has gone. Again the action of the novel moves forward, from Christmas 1494 to October 1496. In that time, Florence has endured political upheaval, warfare and famine. Religious fervour has swept through Florence under the leadership of Savonarola, culminating in the Bonfire of the Vanities. The League of Venice has declared war on the French king and his Italian ally, Florence. Starvation and disease run rampant through the city. Romola, now a supporter of Savonarola, helps the poor and sick where she can. Meanwhile, Tito is embroiled in a complex game of political manoeuvring and duplicitous allegiances in the new Florentine government. Mirroring this, he has escaped attempts by Baldassarre to both kill and expose him, and maintains a secret marriage to Tessa, with whom he has fathered two children. Romola becomes defiant of Tito, and the two manoeuvre to thwart each other's plans. Romola meets an enfeebled Baldassarre, who reveals Tito's past and leads her to Tessa. Political turmoil erupts in Florence. Five supporters of the Medici family are sentenced to death, including Romola's godfather, Bernardo del Nero. She learns that Tito has played a role in their arrest. Romola pleads with Savonarola to intervene, but he refuses. Romola's faith in Savonarola and Florence is shaken, and once again she leaves the city. Meanwhile, Florence is under papal pressure to expel Savonarola. His arrest is effected by rioters, who then turn their attention to several of the city's political elite. Tito becomes a target of the rioters, but he escapes the mob by diving into the Arno River. However, upon leaving the river, Tito is killed by Baldassarre. Romola makes her way to the coast. Emulating Gostanza in Boccaccio's Decameron (V, 2), she drifts out to sea in a small boat to die. However, the boat takes her to a small village affected by the Plague, and she helps the survivors. Romola's experience gives her a new purpose in life and she returns to Florence. Savonarola is tried for heresy and burned at the stake, but for Romola his influence remains inspiring. Romola takes care of Tessa and her two children, with the help of her older cousin. The story ends with Romola imparting advice to Tessa's son, based on her own experiences and the influences in her life.  Characters in Romola  *Romola de' Bardi ‚Äì Daughter of classical scholar Bardo de' Bardi who lives in Florence. She has an insular, non-religious upbringing, immersed in classical studies. She falls in love with Tito Melema and marries him, but she begins to rebel after gradually realizing his true character. Girolamo Savonarola later becomes a great influence in her life. *Tito Melema ‚Äì A handsome, young, Italianate-Greek scholar who arrives in Florence after being shipwrecked. He forsakes his adoptive father and makes a new life for himself in Florence. He marries Romola, and charms his way into the influential circles of Florence. He also \\"marries\\" Tessa in a mock ceremony. His sense of duty towards others is gradually replaced with ambition and self-preservation, earning the disdain of his wife and the vengeful anger of his adoptive father, Baldassarre. *Baldassarre Calvo ‚Äì Adoptive father of Tito Melema. Travelling at sea with Tito, his galley is attacked and Baldassarre is sold into slavery in Antioch. He is eventually brought in chains to Florence, where he escapes. He encounters Tito, who denies him and calls him a madman. Baldassarre, feeble yet fervent, becomes solely motivated by vengeance. *Girolamo Savonarola ‚Äì Charismatic Dominican preacher. He preaches to Florentines about religious piety and upcoming upheaval in Florence and the Church. Romola feels her life being guided by his influence, both direct and broad. Savonarola inspires the people of Florence at first, but the continuing hardship endured by the city leads to his persecution. *Tessa ‚Äì Young and naive Florentine girl. Her young life has been tragic up until she meets Tito Melema. She \\"marries\\" him in a mock wedding ceremony, but is treated as a secret, second wife. As Tito's relationship with Romola wanes, he increasingly seeks the company of the non- judgmental and ignorant Tessa, eventually preferring her to the virtuous and intelligent Romola. *Bardo de' Bardi ‚Äì Blind classical scholar living in Florence. He has one estranged son, Dino, and a daughter, Romola. Bardo is a descendant of the once-powerful Bardi family, but is living in poverty with his daughter, who helps him with his classical studies. He is an ally of the Medici family. He maintains a classical library, and tries to preserve it beyond his own death. *Nello the barber ‚Äì Florentine barber, who fancies his establishment as a meeting place for the Florentine intelligentsia and a forum for political and philosophical discussion. He is a staunch supporter of Tito Melema. *Piero di Cosimo ‚Äì Eccentric artist living in Florence. He paints a betrothal picture for Tito and Romola, representing them as Bacchus and Ariadne (though not in the style of Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne). He distrusts Tito, particularly since many other Florentines (especially Nello the barber) take a quick liking to him. He remains a good friend to Romola. *Dino de' Bardi (aka Fra Luca) ‚Äì Estranged son of Bardo de' Bardi. His father had hoped that Dino would also study classical literature, but instead Dino became a Dominican friar, estranging him from his non-religious family. Just before his death, he warns Romola against a future marriage that will bring her peril. *Bratti Ferravecchi ‚Äì Trader and iron scrap dealer (hence the name). He encounters Tito Melema, who has just arrived in Florence. Various characters in the story often buy and sell various items through him. *Niccol√≤ Machiavelli ‚Äì In this story, Machiavelli often talks with Tito and other Florentines (particularly in Nello's shop) about all matters political and philosophical in Florence. His observations add a commentary to the ongoing events in the city.  Major themes  Literary scholars have drawn comparisons between the setting of the novel and George Eliot's contemporary Victorian England: \\"Philosophically confused, morally uncertain, and culturally uprooted, [Florence] was a prototype of the upheaval of nineteenth- century England\\". Both Renaissance Florence and Victorian England were times of philosophical, religious and social turbulence. Renaissance Florence was therefore a convenient setting for a historical novel that allowed exotic characters and events to be examined in Victorian fashion. Romola is the female protagonist through whom the surrounding world is evaluated. Contemporary and modern critics have questioned the likelihood of the level of scholarship attributed to women such as Romola in Renaissance Italy, and have pointed to the possible role of the title character as a Victorian critique of the constrained lot of women in that period, as well as in Eliot's contemporary period. Felicia Bonaparte speculated about the title character as a \\"thoroughly contemporary figure, the Victorian intellectual struggling to resolve the dilemmas of the modern age\\". In a similar vein, the story also deals with the dilemma of where the duty of obedience for women ends and the duty of resistance begins. The psychological and religious introspection seen in Eliot's other novels is also seen in Romola. Richard Hutton, writing in The Spectator, in 1863, observed that \\"[t]he greatest artistic purpose of the story is to trace out the conflict between liberal culture and the more passionate form of the Christian faith in that strange era, which has so many points of resemblance with the present\\".Richard Hutton, The Spectator, 18 July 1863 in George Eliot: Godless Woman by Brian Spittles (Basingstoke, Hampshire; London: Macmillan Press, 1993) . The spiritual journey undertaken by the title character in some ways emulates Eliot's own religious struggle. In Romola, the title character has a non-religious and scholarly, yet insular, upbringing. She is gradually exposed to the wider religious world, which impacts her life at fortuitous moments. Yet continued immersion in religious life highlights its incompatibility with her own virtues, and by the end of the story she has adopted a humanist, empathic middle ground.  Literary significance and criticism  Romola is George Eliot's fourth published novel. Set in Renaissance Italy, it is isolated from her other novels, which were set in 19th-century England. Also for the first time, George Eliot published her story in serialised format and with a different publisher. Smith, Elder & Co. reportedly paid Eliot ¬£7,000 for the novel, but was less than satisfied with the commercial outcome. Richard Hutton, in the mid-19th century, acknowledged that Romola would never be one of her most popular novels. Nevertheless, Hutton described the novel as \\"one of the greatest works of modern fiction [‚Ä¶] probably the author's greatest work\\". George Eliot herself described her labour in writing the novel as one about which she could \\"swear by every sentence as having been written with my best blood, such as it is, and with the most ardent care for veracity of which my nature is capable\\". She reportedly spent eighteen months contemplating and researching the novel, including several excursions to Florence. The attention to detail exhibited in the novel was a focus of both praise and criticism. Anthony Trollope, having read the first instalment of Romola, expressed wonder at the toil Eliot must have \\"endured in getting up the work\\", but also cautioned her against excessive erudition, urging her not to \\"fire too much over the heads of her readers\\".

It is a consumer price index which is compiled according to a methodology that has been harmonised across EU countries. The euro area HICP is a weighted average of price indices of member states who have adopted the euro. The primary goal of the ECB is to maintain price stability, defined as keeping the year on year increase HICP below but close to 2% for the medium term. In order to do that, the ECB can control the short-term interest rate through Eonia, the European overnight index average, which affects market expectations. The HICP is also used to assess the convergence criteria on inflation which countries must fulfill in order to adopt the euro. In the United Kingdom, the HICP is called the CPI and is used to set the inflation target of the Bank of England. Comparison with the United States The HICP differs from the US CPI in two primary aspects. First, the HICP attempts to incorporate rural consumers into the sample while the US maintains a survey strictly based on the urban population. Currently, the HICP does not fully incorporate rural consumers since it only uses rural samples for creating weights; prices are often only collected in urban areas. The HICP also differs from the US CPI by excluding owner-occupied housing from its scope. The US CPI calculates \\"rental- equivalent\\" costs for owner-occupied housing while the HICP considers such expenditure as investment and excludes it. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the producer of the U.S. CPI, calculated an experimental index designed for direct comparison with the HICP.Lane, Walter; and Mary Lynn Schmidt. 2006. Comparing U.S. and European inflation: the CPI and the HICP. Monthly Labor Review Vol. 129, No. 5 (May), 20-27. In addition, the Division of International Labor Comparisons at the Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles international comparisons of the HICP for different countries.U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Division of International Labor Comparisons, March 3, 2011. Harmonized index of consumer prices for selected countries and areas, percent change from same period of previous year, 2003-2011  Controversy on housing prices  In sharp contrast with the US inflation index, the HICP does not include the cost of housing. This has been the subject of criticism from numerous academics2007, Stephen Cecchetti, https://voxeu.org/article/housing- inflation-measurement, fellow central bankers and members of the European Parliament. In June 2018, Mario Draghi has explained in a letter to MEP Sander LoonesLetter from Mario Draghi to Sander Loones, 12 June 2018 that \\"the ECB has been, from a conceptual point of view, in favour of the inclusion of an owner-occupied housing price index in the HICP\\" but that such change required an assessment from the European statistics agency Eurostat. However the European Commission published a report in November 20182018, European Commission, \\"Report on the suitability of the owner-occupied housing (OOH) price index for integration into the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) coverage\\" with an assessment of whether or not to take into account the cost of owner-occupied housing (OOH) in the HICP. The report concludes against immediate inclusion in 2018, because a monthly OOH price index is not yet available in all EU countries, and because it would deviate from the current definition of the HICP. The Commission's report also indicates that contrary to what Draghi told MEPs, the ECB had opposed the proposal when consulted by Eurostat. Early 2019, the ECB's chief economist Peter Praet nonetheless announced that work was being underway to include real estate prices into HICP: \\"In line with the division of responsibilities at the European level, this work is being led by the ECB in the field of financial variables and by Eurostat for the physical market variables. The two institutions are cooperating closely on the topic and we are confident that they will make good progress.\\"  See also  * Consumer price index * Monetary Union Index of Consumer Prices * HICP database Eurostat Notes  External links  *Harmonized Indexes of Consumer Prices: Their Conceptual Foundations ECB working paper no. 130 (PDF 856 KB) *Compendium of HICP reference documents Eurostat *HICP section on Eurostat's website Eurostat *International comparisons of HICP by the Division of International Labor Comparisons Category:Economy of the European Union Category:Price indices Category:Inflation ","title":"Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices"},{"id":"2427656","text":"The Picrodendreae is a tribe of plants under the family Picrodendraceae.

Feeders collect shipping containers from different ports and transport them to central container terminals where they are loaded to bigger vessels or for further transport by truck or rail into the hub port's hinterland. In that way the smaller vessels feed the big liners, which carry thousands of containers. Over the years, feeder lines have been established by organizations transporting containers over a predefined route on a regular basis. Feeder ships are often run by companies that also specialize in short sea shipping.

He received his B.A. from College of the Holy Cross and his masters and law degree from Georgetown University. He later served as City Corporation Counsel and as a New York Surrogate Court judge. The grave of Mayor John P. O'Brien in Gate of Heaven Cemetery Shortly after the surprise resignation of Mayor Jimmy Walker in 1932, Tammany Hall nominated O'Brien for mayor in a special election, and he beat write-in candidate (and Acting Mayor) Joseph V. McKee by more than half a million votes. O'Brien's inauguration was held in the Hall of Records, at 31 Chambers Street in Manhattan, and was devoid of the pageantry that had greeted many of his predecessors. His inauguration speech did not outline a vision for the city, but rather, reflected on the work of the court and the legal profession in general. In the post inauguration news conference, the new mayor was asked who would be the new police commissioner. \\"I don't know\\" O'Brien answered. \\"They haven't told me yet.\\" Although he is credited with expanding the city's ability to collect taxes, restoring order to the city's finances, and trimming the budget, O'Brien was defeated for re-election in a three-way race by the colorful Republican-City Fusion Party candidate, Fiorello H. La Guardia, in November 1933. He served just one year in office. O'Brien returned to his legal work and served three times as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.

Background Talbot was born January 6, 1897, at South Weymouth, Massachusetts, and attended Weymouth High School. He was gifted both athletically and academically and entered Mercersburg Academy, Pennsylvania, in the autumn of 1915. A year later he entered Yale University. Whilst serving in the college's Artillery Training Corps, Talbot became interested in aviation and enrolled at the Dupont Flying School in Wilmington, Delaware. Early military service Talbot enlisted in the United States Navy in October 1917 with the rank of Seaman 2nd Class. After ground training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and flying tuition in Florida, he became Naval Aviator No. 456. At the time, the Marine Corps were having problems recruiting aviators. Along with a number of other navy pilots, Talbot therefore realised that he was more likely to achieve his ambition of being posted overseas if he joined the Marines.O'Connor, M.Airfields & Airmen of the Channel Coast. Pen & Sword Military, 2005. p.83 Having resigned from the navy, he was appointed a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps Reserve on May 18, 1918. He arrived in Miami a week later to join the First Marine Aviation Force with Squadron C. On July 18, 1918, Talbot was part of the initial party which sailed from New York City for active service as part of the US's involvement in World War I.O'Connor, M. p.83 Involvement in World War I A participant in numerous raids into enemy territory, Second Lieutenant Talbot was attacked by nine Luftstreitkr√§fte enemy scouts while on such a raid over Belgium, October 8, 1918, and in the ensuing fight shot down one of his attackers. Six days later, while on a strike against an enemy ammunition depot at Pittem, he and another plane became detached from the formation due to motor trouble and were attacked by 12 enemy scouts. In the fight which followed, his plane shot down one of the enemy scouts before his observer, Gunnery Sergeant Robert G. Robinson, was shot and the gun jammed. Talbot maneuvered the DeHavilland to gain time while Robinson cleared the gun, then rejoined the battle. Robinson kept on firing until he collapsed from two more wounds. Talbot continued alone, shot down another enemy plane, then dived to escape the remaining Fokker D.VII fighters. Crossing the German trenches at 50 feet, he kept his ship with its failing motor in the air until he reached the nearest hospital where he landed, delivered Robinson to medical personnel and returned to his aerodrome. Second Lieutenant Talbot died on October 25, 1918, when his DH-4 crashed on takeoff, during an engine test flight, at La Fresne aerodrome.

He is an all-rounder who bowls right-arm medium fast and bats left-handed. He was ear marked as the new Lance Klusener from an early age and is famous for his six hitting abilities. Albie has a brother, Morn√© Morkel, who also plays international cricket for South Africa while his father Albert played provincial cricket in South Africa. He has a particularly impressive first class record, with a batting average of 44.0 and a bowling average of 29.0. In January 2019, he retired from all forms of cricket. Currently he is the assistant coach of the Namibia national cricket team which qualified for 2020 ICC T20 World Cup in Australia on 29th Oct 2019.  Career  Morkel at fielding practice, Adelaide Oval, January 2009 = First-class = His bowling was quite impressive in his first seasons in first class cricket, as he burst onto the scene with six for 36 for Easterns against Griqualand West, but in the 2004/05 season he was expected to take more of the bowling effort for the Titans, but took only 20 wickets at a bowling average of 40.65. However, that coincided with an improvement in his batting, as he made his first double century of his career, with 204 not out against Western Province Boland. During the 2008 summer season Morkel played for Durham County Cricket Club in the North East of England along with fellow South African Shaun Pollock mainly in the Twenty20 Cup competition. He was dropped from the national team for the tour of the West indies, opening the door for David Miller and others. In 2012, Morkel was confirmed as Somerset's second overseas player alongside Chris Gayle. Roelof van der Merwe was expected to be retained by Somerset but it was expected that a work permit would not be granted. He joined Derbyshire in 2013 as an overseas player for their Friends Life t20 campaign.BBC Sport ‚Äì Albie Morkel joins Derbyshire for FL t20 campaign. Bbc.co.uk (2013-06-20). Retrieved on 2013-12-23. = International = His statistics on his international debut tour to New Zealand were not very impressive, as he got two wickets at the cost of 48 runs apiece, but he did get five wickets quite cheaply on Zimbabwe's tour of South Africa. Nevertheless, Morkel was picked for the Africa squad to play Asia in the 2005 Afro-Asia Cup, but withdrew due to injury. He appeared however for Africa the following series, in 2007, and made history in the second game when he opened the bowling with his brother Morn√©, the first time two brothers have done so in ODI cricket. In 2009 he secured two-man-of-the-match accolades against Australia in the Commonwealth Series down under, as well as the Man of the Series accolade for the One Day Internationals. He was promoted to the Test side for the third Test of the home series against Australia in 2008/09, replacing his brother Morn√© in the side. = T20 franchise cricket = Albie played for the Chennai Super Kings since the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League where he had a very successful tournament as an all-rounder. He is one of the regular names in the overseas four of the playing XI. Morkel's big-hitting abilities and consistent bowling performances has been one of the key reasons of the Super Kings' successful run in the Indian Premier League. In the 2010 IPL, he struck a record third-wicket partnership in the tournament along with Murali Vijay against the Rajasthan Royals. At the 2012 Indian Premier League, he was the winner of the Super Sixes tournament, with a distance of 105m. Morkel was retained by Chennai for the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League. On 12 April 2012, in the Chepauk stadium at Chennai, he hit 28 runs in one over of Virat Kohli's bowling which ultimately brought victory to Chennai Super Kings from a no win position after chasing a massive total of 206 in the match against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Such exploits with the bat and his useful bowling gained him immense popularity and recognition and made him a household name among the Super Kings' fans. He was purchased by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for ‚Çπ2,40,00,000 ahead of the 2014 season. He was purchased by the Delhi Daredevils for ‚Çπ30,00,000 ahead of the 2015 season. On 9 April 2015 he hit 73 runs off 55 balls against his former team the Chennai Super Kings with eight fours and one six at Chennai. Delhi in the end fell short by one run in a close game. He represented Rising Pune Supergiant for the 2016 Indian Premier League season. In October 2018, he was named in Durban Heat's squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament.

The transshipment may be between container ships and land vehicles, for example trains or trucks, in which case the terminal is described as a maritime container port. Alternatively, the transshipment may be between land vehicles, typically between train and truck, in which case the terminal is described as an inland container port. In November 1932, the first inland container port in the world was opened by the Pennsylvania Railroad company in Enola, Pennsylvania. Port Newark-Elizabeth on the Newark Bay in the Port of New York and New Jersey is considered the world's first maritime container port. On April 26, 1956, the Ideal X was rigged for an experiment to use standardized cargo containers that were stacked and then unloaded to a compatible truck chassis at Port Newark. The concept had been developed by the McLean Trucking Company. On August 15, 1962, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey opened the world‚Äôs first container port, Elizabeth Marine Terminal. Maritime container ports tend to be part of a larger port, and the biggest maritime container ports can be found situated around major harbours. Inland container ports tend to be located in or near major cities, with good rail connections to maritime container ports. It is common for cargo that arrives to a container port in a single ship to be distributed over several modes of transportation for delivery to inland customers. According to a manager from the Port of Rotterdam, it may be fairly typical way for the cargo of a large 18,000 TEU container ship to be distributed over 19 container trains (74 TEU each), 32 barges (97 TEU each) and 1,560 trucks (1.6 TEU each, on average).Port of Rotterdam senior business manager Arwin Stehouwer, quoted in Rail port shuttles growing trend in Europe, Rail Express, July 24, 2015 The further container terminal, in April 2015, such APM Terminal Maasvlakte II, that adapts the advanced technology of remotely-controlled STS gantry cranes and conceptions of sustainability, renewable energy, and zero carbon dioxide emission. Both maritime and inland container ports usually provide storage facilities for both loaded and empty containers. Loaded containers are stored for relatively short periods, whilst waiting for onward transportation, whilst unloaded containers may be stored for longer periods awaiting their next use. Containers are normally stacked for storage, and the resulting stores are known as container stacks. In recent years methodological advances regarding container port operations have considerably improved, such as container port design process.

It was used by Early Christian writers such as Tertullian. The phrase is sometimes used for early creeds. Meaning As a standard for adherence to orthodoxy, rule of faith originally referred to the Old Roman Symbol, which was an earlier and shorter version of the Apostles' Creed and other later statements of faith. As a historical standard for adherence to orthodoxy, rule of faith may also refer to other statements of faith including the Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed, Augsburg Confession, Articles of Dort, Westminster Confession and others, the inner light of the spirit, as among mystics.\\"Rule of Faith\\". The Nuttall Encyclop√¶dia (1907). The rule of faith is the name given to the ultimate authority or standard in religious belief, such as the Word of God (Dei verbum) as contained in Scripture and Apostolic Tradition, as among Catholics; theoria, as among the Eastern Orthodox; the Sola scriptura (Bible alone doctrine), as among some Protestants; the Wesleyan Quadrilateral of faith, which held that Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience, as among other Protestants; and reason alone, as among Rationalist philosophers. =Second century usage= The original rule of faith in the Early Christian Church as Irenaeus knew it, included: \\"Therefore, lest we suffer any such thing, we must keep the rule of faith unswervingly‚Ä¶\\" [the footnote: A common expression in Irenaeus, designating the model of faith which is received in baptism (cf.Against Heresies 1:9:4), and which epitomizes the \\"order and connection of the Scriptures.\\" Cf. Note to Dem. 1; AH 1:8 1‚Äì10:3 (in the 1st footnote: \\"\\"the rule of faith,\\" \\"order and connection\\" of Scripture, and \\"body of truth\\" are used to speak of the same thing). =Third century usage= Tertullian uses the phrases \\"rule of faith\\" and \\"rule of truth\\" in On Prescription Against Heretics: =Catholic usage= Pope Pius XII in Humani generis uses the term analogy of faith to say that Holy Scripture should be interpreted according to the mind of the Church, not that the teaching of the Church and Fathers should be interpreted by some theorised norm of the Scriptures. In the Catholic Church, the Bible and sacred tradition (that is, things believed to have been taught by Jesus and the apostles that were not recorded in the Bible but were transmitted through the church) are considered a rule for all believers for judging faith and practice. The current Catechism of the Catholic Church says, \\"all that has been said about the manner of interpreting Scripture is ultimately subject to the judgement of the Church which exercises the divinely conferred commission and ministry of watching over and interpreting the Word of God The Baltimore Catechism used the phrase \\"rule of faith\\": In Verbum Domini (2010), Pope Benedict XVI wrote:The Latin can be found on page 15 here. =Protestant usage= In some Protestant theology, it is a hermeneutical rule of interpreting the Bible that scripture is to interpret scripture (Sacra Scriptura sui interpres: sacred Scripture is its own interpreter). It is an understanding that enforces the Bible as the inspired Word of God, and it is therefore consistent and coherent since God cannot contradict himself.Sproul, R. C., et al.

Natural sources of alkylresorcinols  Alkylresorcinols are relatively rare in nature, with the main known sources being wheat, rye, barley, triticale (cereal grasses), the fruit of Ginkgo biloba Bilobol, a mollusc and some species of bacteria. DB-2073 (2-n-hexyl-5-n-propylresorcinol) DB-2073 is an antibiotic isolated from the broth culture of Pseudomonas sp. They are also the main constituents of the outer shell of the cyst of Azotobacter. = Occurrence in cereals = Alkylresorcinols are present in high amounts in the bran layer (e.g. pericarp, testa and aleurone layers) of wheat and rye (0.1-0.3 % of dry weight). 5-Alkylresorcinols can also be found in rice, though not in the edible parts of the rice plant. They are only present in very low amounts in the endosperm (the part of cereal grain that is used to make white flour), which means that alkylresorcinols can be used as 'biomarkers' for people who eat foods containing wholegrain wheat and rye, rather than cereal products based on white flour. Alkylresorcinols were thought to have anti-nutritive properties (e.g. decreasing growth of pigs and chickens fed rye), but this theory has been discredited, and a number of animal studies have demonstrated that they have no obvious negative effect on animals or humans.  Biomarkers of a whole grain diet  Increasing evidence from human intervention trials suggests that they are the most promising biomarker of whole grain wheat and rye intake. Alkylresorcinol metabolites, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylpropionoic acid (DHPPA) were first identified in urine and can be quantified in urine and plasma, and may be an alternative, equivalent biomarker of whole grain wheat intake. The average intake of alkylresorcinols in the UK is around 11 mg/person/day, and in Sweden is around 20 mg/person/day. This varies widely depending on whether people normally consume wholegrain/wholemeal/brown bread, which is high in alkylresorcinols (300-1000 Œºg/g), or white wheat bread, which has very low concentrations of alkylresorcinols (<50 Œºg/g).  Possible biological activities  In vitro studies have shown that alkylresorcinols may prevent cells turning cancerous, but that they do not have any effect on cells that are already cancerous. Alkylresorcinols also increase gamma-tocopherol levels in rats when fed in high amounts (0.2% of total diet and above. The alkylresorcinols in Grevillea banksii and Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' are responsible for contact dermatitis.

The site is now in Spring Valley. During both wars, the university allowed the U.S. military to use parts of its grounds for weapons development and testing. In 1917, 24 days after the United States declared war on Germany, the university offered its property to the war effort. The military divided the campus into two segments, Camp American University and Camp Leach. The two camps were considered at the time to be \\"the largest laboratory this side of the sun or other burning stars.\\" Thus, during World War I, Camp American University and Camp Leach became the birthplace of the United States' chemical weapons program. About 100,000 soldiers and 2,000 chemists were employed on the campus. What is now Spring Valley was an undeveloped area on the main campus of American University where the Army was allowed to use for testing chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, therefore also known as the American University Experimental Station or Camp Leach. At the far corner of the university, the military also tested some of its weapons. When the war had ended it was reported that $800,000 (in 1918-dollars) worth of World War I munitions were buried in a pit in the same corner of the university. 1990s cleanup In 1993, during excavations of a utility trench, construction workers found unexploded ordnance, and scientists found high levels of arsenic in the soil. The next day it was reported in The Washington Post that World War I bomb shells had been unearthed near a Senator's house bordering the university grounds. This touched off a cleanup effort by the Environmental Protection Agency and Army who call it the Spring Valley Formerly Used Defense Site. This cleanup lasted nearly two years. 21st century cleanup A decade later, in 2003 many more dangerous sites in the area were uncovered, including perchlorate in groundwater and three burial pits on grounds of the South Korean ambassador's residence. In 2005 ATSDR issued a \\"Health Consultation\\"' and 2 years later Johns Hopkins University was contracted for a health study, and reported in 2007. A review of all site data and previous health studies was supposed to be completed by 2013. As of 2017, the work is still ongoing with tons of earth being replaced and at least one house being scheduled for demolition. The site, which included a corner of the university and several neighboring residences, including the residence of the Embassy of South Korea, which occupies a significant percentage of the site. As no buildings have been built directly atop the site, the military announced that the effects of neither the residual chemicals nor the cleanup program will have any effects on students living on the campus. A Restoration Advisory Board is in place. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is the lead agency in clean up.

Biography Parysatis was the illegitimate daughter of Artaxerxes I, Emperor of Persia and Andia of Babylon. She was the half-sister of Xerxes II, Sogdianus, and Darius II. She married her half-brother Darius IIAgesilaos , P Cartledge p186 and had 13 sons, of which four survived to adulthood: Artaxerxes II, Cyrus the Younger, Ostanes, and Oxathres.Plutarch, Lives, Life of Artaxerxes and one daughter - Amestris. =Influence at the Persian Court= Parysatis was very powerful and had a network of spies and informants. Ctesias, who was her physician, mentions in his books how she would identify and order the execution of various people who were a threat to the throne. Parysatis was very savvy and succeeded in assisting Darius II's ascent to the throne, even though he was a bastard and not a legitimate child. Ctesias records that he was very dependent on her counsel. In addition, she is mentioned to have held a lot of land and villages in Syria, Media and Babylon, and a record of the taxes paid directly to her remained, as well as the servant who was in charge of managing her holdings and tax collections - Ea bullissu. =Supporting Cyrus the Younger= Queen Parysatis flaying a eunuch James Ensor Her favorite son was Cyrus, and it was on account of her influence that he was given supreme command in western Anatolia as a teenager in around 407 BC.Agesilaos , P Cartledge p186 When her husband died, she supported Cyrus. When Cyrus was defeated in the Battle of Cunaxa, she blamed the satrap Tissaphernes for his death, and thus had him assassinated a little later. According to the chapter on Artaxerxes II in Plutarch's Life, a young Persian soldier named Mithridates unknowingly struck Cyrus the Younger during the Battle of Cunaxa (Greek: ŒöŒøœçŒΩŒ±ŒæŒ±), making him fall from his horse, dazed. Some eunuchs found Cyrus and tried to bring him to safety, but a Caunian among the king's camp followers struck a vein behind his knee with a dart, making him fall and strike his head on a stone, whereupon he died. Unwisely, Mithridates boasted of killing Cyrus in the court, and Parysatis had him executed by scaphism. She likewise got vengeance on Masabates, the king's eunuch, who had cut off Cyrus' hand and head, by winning him from her son Artaxerxes in a game of dice and having him flayed alive.Plutarch. Ed. by A.H. Clough. \\"Artaxerxes,\\" Plutarch's Lives. 1996. Project Gutenberg =Rivalry with Stateira= Stateira was the wife of Artaxerxes II. Her brother, Terituchmes, loved one of his half-sisters more than his intended bride - Amestris, Darius II and Parysatis's daughter. Terituchmes tried to start a rebellion, and Parysatis had all the family killed and only spared the life of Stateira at the request of her husband.Ctesias, Persica 55-56 (in an excerpt from Photius I of Constantinople). After Artaxerxes II took control and Cryus's attempt to seize the throne failed, the queen mother Parysatis and queen consort Stateira both tried to be the key political influence on the king, making them bitter rivals. Reportedly the intense hatred between the two women led Parysatis to encourage Artaxerxes II to take on concubines in order to hurt his wife. Stateira also publicly spoke up against the cruelties of the queen mother at the Persian court. For example, she criticized the brutal treatment of the eunuch Masabates, intensifying her conflict with Parysatis. Finally, Parysatis had Stateira murdered. Classical sources give different reasons for this deed. According to one version, Parysatis wanted to save the life of the Spartan commander Clearchus and his fellow-generals, who had been taken prisoner by Tissaphernes, but Stateira had succeeded in persuading her husband to execute the prisoners. Therefore, Parysatis is supposed to have poisoned Stateira. Plutarch, in his biography of Artaxerxes II, did not believe this story. According to another tradition, Parysatis murdered her daughter-in-law because she realized that her son only felt true love for his wife. Plutarch reports that Parysatis performed the assassination with the help of a loyal servant named Gigis. She carved a bird with a poisoned knife in such a way that only one half of the animal was mixed with the poison. This half was served to Stateira when they were dining together. The poisoned meal caused the painful death of Stateira.Plutarch, Artaxerxes 5-6 and 17-19 (mainly based on Ctesias). Artaxerxes was enraged and tried to capture Gigis, who was being hidden in Parysatis's quarters. Eventually, she was captured when she visited her family and was executed.

The company brews their own beer, distills their own spirits, farms their own ingredients and coopers their own barrels. Rogue has locations in Oregon and Washington. History Rogue Ales was founded in Ashland, Oregon in 1988 by three Nike, Inc. executives: Jack Joyce, Rob Strasser, and Bob Woodell. In 1987, Jack Joyce, Bob Woodell, past University of Oregon fraternity brothers, and another friend, Rob Strasser, were approached by Jeff Schultz, Woodell's accountant and avid home brewer, with an idea to open a brewpub. Construction began in June 1988 in Ashland along the Lithia Creek. The 10 bbl brew system was set up in the basement with a 60-seat Pub above. The first brews were American Amber Ale, Oregon Golden Ale and Shakespeare Stout. The Brewery and Pub opened in October 1988 to moderate success and soon, the company started looking to expand. In February 1989, construction began on the Bay Front Brew Pub in Newport, Oregon. In March, John Maier, a former Hughes Aircraft F15 designer and Seibel Institute graduate, joined the company. Mair was previously a brewer at Alaskan Brewing before he was recruited by Joyce. The pub opened in May 1989. Rogue now has eleven locations dispersed throughout Oregon, Washington, and California . Rogue has sponsored the annual surfing event \\"The Gathering Longboard Classic\\" on Newport's South Beach. At the end of 2018 Brett Joyce, (Jack Joyce's son) stepped down as company president and was replaced by general manager Dharma Tamm. Joyce retains an ownership stake and remains on the board. Brewing Portland Brewmaster John C. Maier joined the company in 1989 from Alaskan Brewing. Rogue has produced more than 60 different ales. The company uses a proprietary yeast known as \\"Pacman\\". Maier says that all of their beers are meant to go with food, and the company has worked with chefs, brewing industry experts,Beertalk and restaurateurs. Chipotle Ale\\"...smoky, subtly peppery palate matching the heat and spice of chilie-based cuisine.\\" Maier stepped down as brewmaster in July of 2019, and was replaced by Joel Shields. =Notable brews= Rogue has collaborated on brewing beers with Rogue Creamery, Portland State, Voodoo Doughnut, Dark Horse Comics, and others. The brewery released Hot Sriracha Stout in 2013, made with the sauce of the same name. The brewery once created a beer using a strain of yeast found in Brewmaster Maier's beard, known as their Beard Beer. Rogue has entered contests held by the Brewers Association multiple times, and has received several medals. Rogue has entered both the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and the World Beer Cup (WBC). Labor issues In 2011, a group of employees from the Rogue Brewery in Newport, Oregon unsuccessfully attempted to unionize. Rogue was accused at the time for union-busting tactics at their Newport brewery, and has been questioned for their salary standards. Rogue's Eugene Public House and Track Town Brewery was shut down in 2014. According to Northwest Brewing News this was at least in part also due to Rogue's \\"cheapskate management tactics\\". Rogue reportedly refused to let the brewers have an assistant, and some brewers were forced to carry heavy loads and spend their own money to work within the company's dollar-per-keg budget limits. In July 2015, company president Brett Joyce dismissed those with complaints as having \\"an ax to grind\\".

It originally received Royal assent in August 1935. It was the longest Act of (British) Parliament ever enacted until Greater London Authority Act 1999 surpassed it. Because of its length, the Act was retroactively split by the Government of India Act, 1935 into two separate Acts: * The Government of India Act, 1935 , having 321 sections and 10 schedules. * The Government of Burma Act, 1935 having 159 sections and 6 schedules. The Act led to: * 1. Establishment of RBI. * 2. FPSC, PPSC, JPSC. * 3. Federal Court in 1937. * 4. Bicameralism in 6 provinces (Bombay, Madras, Bengal, Bihar, Assam and United Provinces) out of 11 provinces. Overview The most significant aspects of the Act were: * the grant of a large measure of autonomy to the provinces of British India (ending the system of diarchy introduced by the Government of India Act 1919) * provision for the establishment of a \\"Federation of India\\", to be made up of both British India and some or all of the \\"princely states\\" * the introduction of direct elections, thus increasing the franchise from seven million to thirty-five million people * a partial reorganization of the provinces: ** Sindh was separated from Bombay ** Bihar and Orissa was split into separate provinces of Bihar and Orissa ** Burma was completely separated from India ** Aden was also detached from India, and established as a separate Crown colony * membership of the provincial assemblies was altered so as to include any number of elected Indian representatives, who were now able to form majorities and be appointed to form governments * the establishment of a Federal Court However, the degree of autonomy introduced at the provincial level was subject to important limitations: the provincial Governors retained important reserve powers, and the British authorities also retained a right to suspend responsible government. The parts of the Act intended to establish the Federation of India never came into operation, due to opposition from rulers of the princely states. The remaining parts of the Act came into force in 1937, when the first elections under the act were also held. The Features of this act were as follows; 1-it provided for the establishment of all India federation consisting of provinces and princely states as units. the act divided the powers between center and units in terms of three lists-Federal list, Provincial list and the con current list. Background Indians had increasingly been demanding a greater role in the government of their country since the late 19th century. The Indian contribution to the British war effort during the First World War meant that even the more conservative elements in the British political establishment felt the necessity of constitutional change, resulting in the Government of India Act 1919. That Act introduced a novel system of government known as provincial \\"diarchy\\", i.e., certain areas of government (such as education) were placed in the hands of ministers responsible to the provincial legislature, while others (such as public order and finance) were retained in the hands of officials responsible to the British-appointed provincial Governor. While the Act was a reflection of the demand for a greater role in government by Indians, it was also very much a reflection of British fears about what that role might mean in practice for India (and of course for British interests there). The experiment with dyarchy proved unsatisfactory. A particular frustration for Indian politicians was that even for those areas over which they had gained nominal control, the \\"purse strings\\" were still in the hands of British officialdom. The intention had been that a review of India's constitutional arrangements would be held ten years on from the 1919 Act. In the event, the review was conducted ahead of time by the Simon Commission, whose report proposed the scrapping of dyarchy, and the introduction of a much larger degree of responsible government in the provinces. This proposal was controversial in Britain, demonstrating the rapidly widening gulf between British and Indian opinions as to the desirability, extent, and the speed of progress towards, the promised system of self-government contained in the 1919 Act's preamble. Although the Simon Commission had taken evidence in India, it had met with opposition there, and its conclusions weren't accepted by Congress (the largest political party). In an attempt to involve Indians more fully in working out a new constitutional framework, a series of Round Table Conferences were then held in the early 1930s, attended at times by representatives from India's main political parties, as well as from the princely states. Agreement was reached in principle that a federal system of government should be introduced, comprising the provinces of British India and those princely states that were willing to accede to it. However, division between Congress and Muslim representatives proved to be a major factor in preventing agreement on much of the important detail of how federation would work in practice. The new Conservative-dominated National Government in London decided to go ahead with drafting its own proposals (white paper, March 1933).Butler 1971, p46 A joint parliamentary select committee, chaired by Lord Linlithgow, reviewed the white paper proposals for a year and a half between April 1933 and November 1934, amidst much opposition from Winston Churchill and other backbench Conservatives. The House of Commons approved the Joint Select Committee report in December after an emollient speech by Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin, who stated that he respected the principled position of the bill‚Äôs opponents, and that he did not wish feelings in his own party to become permanently embittered.Butler 1971, p53 On the basis of the white paper, the Government of India Bill was framed. It was immensely long, containing 473 clauses and 16 schedules, and the reports of the debates took up 4,000 pages of Hansard.Butler 1971, p55 At the committee stage and later, to appease the diehards, the \\"safeguards\\" were strengthened, and indirect elections were reinstated for the Central Legislative Assembly (the central legislature's lower house). The opposition Labour Party opposed the Third Reading of the bill on the grounds that it contained no specific promise of dominion status for India. It received Royal Assent and passed into law on 2 August 1935.Butler 1971, pp58-60 As a result of this process, although the Government of India Act 1935 was intended to go some way towards meeting Indian demands, both the detail of the bill and the lack of Indian involvement in drafting its contents meant that the Act met with a lukewarm response at best in India, while still proving too radical for a significant element in Britain. Features =No preamble: the ambiguity of British commitment to dominion status= While it had become uncommon for British Acts of Parliament to contain a preamble, the absence of one from the Government of India Act 1935 contrasts sharply with the 1919 Act, which set out the broad philosophy of that Act's aims in relation to Indian political development. That Act's preamble quoted, and centred on, the statement of the Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu, to the House of Commons on 20 August 1917, which pledged \\"the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to the progressive realization of responsible government in India as an integral Part of the British Empire\\".The Ideas and Ideals of the British Empire, Ernest Barker, CUP Archive, 1946, page 124 Indian demands were by now centring on British India achieving constitutional parity with the existing Dominions (Australia, Canada, the Irish Free State, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa) which would have meant complete autonomy within the British Commonwealth. A significant element in British political circles doubted that Indians were capable of running their country on this basis, and saw Dominion status as something that might, perhaps, be aimed for after a long period of gradual constitutional development, with sufficient \\"safeguards\\". This tension between and within Indian and British views resulted in the clumsy compromise of the 1935 Act having no preamble of its own, but keeping in place the 1919 Act's preamble even while repealing the remainder of that Act. Unsurprisingly, this was seen in India as yet more mixed messages from the British, suggesting at best a lukewarm attitude and at worst suggesting a \\"minimum necessary\\" approach towards satisfying Indian desires. =No 'Bill of Rights'= In common with Commonwealth constitutional legislation of the time, the Act did not include a \\"bill of rights\\" within the new system that it aimed to establish. However, in the case of the proposed Federation of India, there was a further complication in incorporating such a set of rights, as the new entity would have included nominally sovereign (and generally autocratic) princely states. A different approach was considered by some, though, as the draft outline constitution in the Nehru Report included such a bill of rights. =Excess \\"safeguards\\"= In 1947, with a relatively few amendments, the Act became the functioning interim constitutions of India and Pakistan. The Act was not only extremely detailed, but also contained many \\"safeguards\\" designed to enable the British Government to intervene whenever it saw the need in order to maintain British responsibilities and interests. To achieve this, in the face of a gradually increasing Indianisation of the institutions of the Government of India, the Act concentrated the decision for the use and the actual administration of the safeguards in the hands of the British-appointed Viceroy and provincial governors who were subject to the control of the Secretary of State for India. :'In view of the enormous powers and responsibilities which the Governor-General must exercise his discretion or according to his individual judgment, it is obvious that he (the Viceroy) is expected to be a kind of Superman. He must have tact, courage, and ability and be endowed with an infinite capacity for hard work. \\"We have put into this Bill many safeguards\\", said Sir Robert Horne‚Ä¶ \\"but all of those safeguards revolve about a single individual, and that is the Viceroy. He is the linchpin of the whole system‚Ä¶. If the Viceroy fails, nothing can save the system you have set up\\". This speech reflected the point of view of the die-hard Tories who were horrified by the prospect that someday there might be a Viceroy appointed by a Labour government.' = Nature of representative government?= A close reading of the ActShah 1937. reveals that the British Government equipped itself with the legal instruments to take back total control at any time they considered this to be desirable. However, doing so without good reason would totally sink their credibility with groups in India whose support the act was aimed at securing. Some contrasting views: > \\"In the federal government‚Ä¶ the semblance of responsible government is > presented. But the reality is lacking, for the powers in defense and > external affairs necessarily, as matters stand, given to the governor- > general limit vitally the scope of ministerial activity, and the measure of > representation given to the rulers of the Indian States negatives any > possibility of even the beginnings of democratic control. It will be a > matter of the utmost interest to watch the development of a form of > government so unique; certainly, if it operates successfully, the highest > credit will be due to the political capacity of Indian leaders, who have > infinitely more serious difficulties to face than had the colonial statesmen > who evolved the system of self-government which has now culminated in > Dominion status\\".Keith 1937, p. viii. Lord Lothian, in a talk lasting forty-five minutes, came straight out with his view not on the Bill: > \\"I agree with the diehards that it has been a surrender. You who are not > used to any constitution cannot realize what great power you are going to > wield. If you look at the constitution it looks as if all the powers are > vested in the Governor-General and the Governor. But is not every power here > vested in the King? Everything is done in the name of the King but does the > King ever interfere? Once the power passes into the hands of the > legislature, the Governor or the Governor-General is never going to > interfere. ‚Ä¶The Civil Service will be helpful. You too will realize this. > Once a policy is laid down they will carry it out loyally and faithfully‚Ä¶ We > could not help it. We had to fight the diehards here. You could not realize > what great courage has been shown by Mr. Baldwin and Sir Samuel Hoare. We > did not want to spare the diehards as we had to talk in a different > language‚Ä¶ These various meetings ‚Äì and in due course G.D. (Birla), before > his return in September, met virtually everyone of importance in Anglo- > Indian affairs ‚Äì confirmed G.D.'s original opinion that the differences > between the two countries were largely psychological, the same proposals > open to diametrically opposed interpretations. He had not, probably, taken > in before his visit how considerable, in the eyes of British conservatives, > the concessions had been‚Ä¶ If nothing else, successive conversations made > clear to G.D. that the agents of the Bill had at least as heavy odds against > them at home as they had in India. Ross, p. 99 ff. =False equivalences= > it is very important act in indian history. \\"The law, in its majestic > equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to > beg in the streets, and to steal bread.\\"Anatole FRANCE, The Red Lily, 1894. Under the Act, British citizens resident in the UK and British companies registered in the UK must be treated on the same basis as Indian citizens and Indian registered companies unless UK law denies reciprocal treatment. The unfairness of this arrangement is clear when one considers the dominant position of British capital in much of the Indian modern sector and the complete dominance, maintained through unfair commercial practices, of UK shipping interests in India's international and coastal shipping traffic and the utter insignificance of Indian capital in Britain and the non-existence of Indian involvement in shipping to or within the UK. There are very detailed provisions requiring the Viceroy to intervene if, in his unappealable view, any India law or regulation is intended to, or will, in fact, discriminate against UK resident British subjects, British registered companies and, particularly, British shipping interests. > \\"The Joint Committee considered a suggestion that trade with foreign > countries should be made by the Minister of Commerce, but it decided that > all negotiations with foreign countries should be conducted by the Foreign > Office or Department of External Affairs as they are in the United Kingdom. > In concluding agreements of this character, the Foreign Secretary always > consults the Board of Trade and it was assumed that the Governor-General > would in like manner consult the Minister of Commerce in India. This may be > true, but the analogy itself is false. In the United Kingdom, both > departments are subject to the same legislative control, whereas in India > one is responsible to the federal legislature and the other to the Imperial > Parliament\\".Smith. =Difficulty of offering further concessions= From the moment of the Montagu statement of 1917, it was vital that the reform process stay ahead of the curve if the British were to hold the strategic initiative. However, imperialist sentiment, and a lack of realism, in British political circles made this impossible. Thus the grudging conditional concessions of power in the Acts of 1919 and 1935 caused more resentment and signally failed to win the Raj the backing of influential groups in India which it desperately needed. In 1919 the Act of 1935, or even the Simon Commission plan would have been well received. There is evidence that Montagu would have backed something of this sort but his cabinet colleagues would not have considered it. By 1935, a constitution establishing a Dominion of India, comprising the British Indian provinces might have been acceptable in India though it would not have passed the British Parliament. > 'Considering the balance of power in the Conservative party at the time, the > passing of a Bill more liberal than that which was enacted in 1935 is > inconceivable.'Moore 1988, p. 63. Provincial part The provincial part of the Act, which went into effect automatically, basically followed the recommendations of the Simon Commission. Provincial dyarchy was abolished; that is, all provincial portfolios were to be placed in charge of ministers enjoying the support of the provincial legislatures. The British-appointed provincial governors, who were responsible to the British Government via the Viceroy and Secretary of State for India, were to accept the recommendations of the ministers unless, in their view, they negatively affected his areas of statutory \\"special responsibilities\\" such as the prevention of any grave menace to the peace or tranquility of a province and the safeguarding of the legitimate interests of minorities. In the event of a political breakdown, the governor, under the supervision of the Viceroy, could take over total control of the provincial government. This, in fact, allowed the governors a more untrammeled control than any British official had enjoyed in the history of the Raj. After the resignation of the Congress provincial ministries in 1939, the governors did directly rule the ex-Congress provinces throughout the war. It was generally recognized that the provincial part of the Act conferred a great deal of power and patronage on provincial politicians as long as both British officials and Indian politicians played by the rules. However, the paternalistic threat of the intervention by the British governor rankled Indian nationalists. Federal part Unlike the provincial portion of the Act, the Federal portion was to go into effect only when half the States by weight agreed to federate. This never happened and the establishment of the Federation was indefinitely postponed after the outbreak of the Second World War. =Terms= The Act provided for Dyarchy at the Centre. The British Government, in the person of the Secretary of State for India, through the Governor-General of India ‚Äì Viceroy of India, would continue to control India‚Äôs financial obligations, defence, foreign affairs and the British Indian Army and would make the key appointments to the Reserve Bank of India (exchange rates) and Railway Board and the Act stipulated that no finance bill could be placed in the Central Legislature without the consent of the Governor General. The funding for the British responsibilities and foreign obligations (e.g. loan repayments, pensions), at least 80 percent of the federal expenditures, would be non-votable and be taken off the top before any claims could be considered for (for example) social or economic development programs. The Viceroy, under the supervision of the Secretary of State for India, was provided with overriding and certifying powers that could, theoretically, have allowed him to rule autocratically. Terms of the Act. =Objectives= The federal part of the Act was designed to meet the aims of the Conservative Party. Over the very long term, the Conservative leadership expected the Act to lead to a nominally dominion status India, conservative in outlook, dominated by an alliance of Hindu princes and right-wing Hindus which would be well disposed to place itself under the guidance and protection of the United Kingdom. In the medium term, the Act was expected to (in rough order of importance): *win the support of moderate nationalists since its formal aim was to lead eventually to a Dominion of India which, as defined under the Statute of Westminster 1931 virtually equaled independence; *retain British control of the Indian Army, Indian finances, and India‚Äôs foreign relations for another generation; *win Muslim support by conceding most of Jinnah's Fourteen Points; Jinnah‚Äôs Fourteen Points at Story of Pakistan. *convince the Princes to join the Federation by giving the Princes conditions for entry never likely to be equaled. It was expected that enough would join to allow the establishment of the Federation. The terms offered to the Princes included: **Each Prince would select his state‚Äôs representative in the Federal Legislature. There would be no pressure for Princes to democratize their administrations or allow elections for state representatives in the Federal Legislature. **The Princes would enjoy heavyweight. The Princely States represented about a quarter of the population of India and produced well under a quarter of its wealth. Under the Act: ***The Upper House of the Federal Legislature, the Council of State, would consist of 260 members: 156 (60%) elected from British India and 104 (40%) nominated by the rulers of the princely states. ***The Lower House, the Federal Assembly, would consist of 375 members: 250 (67%) elected by the Legislative Assemblies of the British Indian provinces; 125 (33%) nominated by the rulers of the princely states. *ensuring that the Congress could never rule alone or gain enough seats to bring down the government This was done by over-representing the Princes, by giving every possible minority the right to separately vote for candidates belonging to their respective communities (see separate electorate), and by making the executive theoretically, but not practically, removable by the legislature. =Gambles taken= *Viability of the proposed Federation. It was hoped that the gerrymandered federation, encompassing units of such hugely different sizes, sophistication and varying in forms of government from the autocratic Princely States to democratic provinces, could provide the basis for a viable state. However, this was not a realistic possibility (see e.g. The Making of India‚Äôs Paper Federation, 1927-35 in Moore 1988). In reality, the Federation, as planned in the Act, almost certainly was not viable and would have rapidly broken down with the British left to pick up the pieces without any viable alternative. *Princes Seeing and Acting in Their Own Long-Range Best Interests - That the Princes would see that their best hope for a future would lie in rapidly joining and become a united block without which no group could hope, mathematically, to wield power. However, the princes did not join, and thus exercising the veto provided by the Act prevented the Federation from coming into existence. Among the reasons for the Princes staying out were the following: **They did not have the foresight to realize that this was their only chance for a future. **Congress had begun and would continue, agitating for democratic reforms within the Princely States. Since the one common concern of the 600 or so Princes was their desire to continue to rule their states without interference, this was indeed a mortal threat. It was on the cards that this would lead eventually to more democratic state regimes and the election of states' representatives in the Federal Legislature. In all likelihood, these representatives would be largely Congressmen. Had the Federation been established, the election of states' representatives in the Federal Legislature would amount to a Congress coup from the inside. Thus, contrary to their official position that the British would look favorably on the democratization of the Princely States, their plan required that the States remain autocratic. This reflects a deep contradiction on British views of India and its future. > 'At a banquet in the princely state of Benares, Hailey observed that > although the new federal constitution would protect their position in the > central government, the internal evolution of the states themselves remained > uncertain. Most people seemed to expect them to develop representative > institutions. Whether those alien grafts from Westminster would succeed in > British India, however, itself remained in doubt. Autocracy was \\"a principle > which is firmly seated in the Indian States,\\" he pointed out; \\"round it burn > the sacred fires of an age-long tradition,\\" and it should be given a fair > chance first. Autocratic rule, \\"informed by wisdom, exercised in moderation > and vitalized by a spirit of service to the interests of the subject, may > well prove that it can make an appeal in India as strong as that of > representative and responsible institutions.\\" This spirited defence brings > to mind Nehru's classic paradox of how the representatives of the advanced, > dynamic West allied themselves with the most reactionary forces of the > backward, stagnant East.'Cell, p. 210. Under the Act, > 'There are a number of restrictions on the freedom of discussion in the > federal legislature. For example, the act forbids ... any discussion of, or > the asking of questions about, a matter connected with an Indian State, > other than a matter with respect to which the federal legislature has power > to make laws for that state, unless the Governor-General in his discretion > is satisfied that the matter affects federal interests or affects a British > subject, and has given his consent to the matter being discussed or the > question being asked.' **They were not a cohesive group and probably realized that they would never act as one. **Each Prince seemed consumed by the desire to gain the best deal for himself, were his state to join the Federation: the most money, the most autonomy. *That enough was being offered at the Centre to win the support of moderate nationalist Hindu and Muslim support. In fact, so little was offered that all significant groups in British India rejected and denounced the proposed Federation. A major contributing factor was the continuing distrust of British intentions for which there was considerable basis in fact. In this vital area the Act failed Irwin‚Äôs test: > 'I don't believe that‚Ä¶ it is impossible to present the problem in such a > form as would make the shop window look respectable from an Indian point of > view, which is really what they care about while keeping your hand pretty > firmly on the things that matter.' (Irwin to Stonehaven, 12 November 1928) *That the wider electorate would turn against the Congress. In fact, the 1937 elections showed overwhelming support for Congress among the Hindu electorate. *That by giving Indian politicians a great deal of power at the provincial level, while denying them responsibility at the Centre, it was hoped that Congress, the only national party, would disintegrate into a series of provincial fiefdoms. In fact, the Congress High Command was able to control the provincial ministries and to force their resignation in 1939. The Act showed the strength and cohesion of Congress and probably strengthened it. This does not imply that Congress was not made up of and found its support in various sometimes competing interests and groups. Rather, it recognises the ability of Congress, unlike the British Raj, to maintain the cooperation and support of most of these groups even if, for example in the forced resignation of Congress provincial ministries in 1939 and the rejection of the Cripps Offer in 1942, this required a negative policy that was harmful, in the long run, to the prospects for an independent India that would be both united and democratic. =Indian reaction= No significant group in India accepted the Federal portion of the Act. A typical response was: > 'After all, there are five aspects of every Government worth the name: (a) > The right of external and internal defence and all measures for that > purpose; (b) The right to control our external relations; (c) The right to > control our currency and exchange; (d) The right to control our fiscal > policy; (e) the day-to-day administration of the land‚Ä¶.

You shall have nothing to do, or, for all practical purposes > in future, you shall have nothing to do with your currency and exchange, for > indeed the Reserve Bank Bill just passed has a further reservation in the > Constitution that no legislation may be undertaken with a view to > substantially alter the provisions of that Act except with the consent of > the Governor-General‚Ä¶. there is no real power conferred in the Centre.' > (Speech by Mr. Bhulabhai DESAI on the Report of the Joint Parliamentary > Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform, 4 February 1935).Gwyer & > Appadorai, p. 320. However, the Liberals and even elements in the Congress were tepidly willing to give it a go: > \\"Linlithgow asked Sapru whether he thought there was a satisfactory > alternative to the scheme of the 1935 Act.

Receptions Nehru called it \\"a machine with strong brakes but no engine\\". He also called it a \\"Charter of Slavery\\"History and Culture of Pakistan Jinnah called it, \\"thoroughly rotten, fundamentally bad and totally unacceptable.\\" Winston Churchill conducted a campaign against Indian self-government from 1929 onwards. When the bill passed, he denounced it in the House of Commons as \\"a gigantic quilt of jumbled crochet work, a monstrous monument of shame built by pygmies\\". Leo Amery, who spoke next, opened his speech with the words \\"Here endeth the last chapter of the Book of Jeremiah\\" and commented that Churchill's speech had been \\"not only a speech without a ray of hope; it was a speech from beginning to end, like all his speeches on the subject, utterly and entirely negative and devoid of constructive thought.\\"Rhodes James 1970, p.212 Rab Butler, who as Under-Secretary for India helped pilot the Act through the House of Commons, later wrote that it helped to set India on the path of Parliamentary democracy. Butler blamed Jinnah for the subsequent secession of Pakistan, likening his strength of character to that of the Ulster Unionist leader Edward Carson, and wrote that \\"men like Jinnah are not born every day\\", although he also blamed Congress for not having done enough to court the Muslims. In 1954 Butler stayed in Delhi, where Nehru, who Butler believed had mellowed somewhat from his extreme views of the 1930s, told him that the Act, based on the English constitutional principles of Dicey and Anson, had been the foundation of the Indian Independence Bill.Butler 1971, pp.58-60 Act Implementation The British government sent out Lord Linlithgow as the new viceroy with the remit of bringing the Act into effect. Linlithgow was intelligent, extremely hard working, honest, serious and determined to make a success out of the Act. However, he was also unimaginative, stolid, legalistic and found it very difficult to \\"get on terms\\" with people outside his immediate circle. In 1937, after the holding of provincial elections, Provincial Autonomy commenced. From that point until the declaration of war in 1939, Linlithgow tirelessly tried to get enough of the Princes to accede to launch the Federation. In this, he received only the weakest backing from the Home Government and in the end the Princes rejected the Federation en masse. In September 1939, Linlithgow simply declared that India was at war with Germany. Though Linlithgow's behavior was constitutionally correct it was also offensive to much of Indian opinion that the Viceroy had not consulted the elected representatives of the Indian people before taking such a momentous decision. This led directly to the resignation of the Congress provincial ministries. From 1939, Linlithgow concentrated on supporting the war effort.

However, in countries with large Vodou populations (such as Benin, Togo or Haiti), some Christian influence may have given homosexuality a social stigma (see homosexuality and Christianity), at least on some levels of society. Haitian Vodou itself has remained open to people of all sexual orientations. It is common knowledge in Haiti that a significant number of Haitian Vodou are gay. Many LGBT people in Haiti believe that it is easier to be open about one's sexuality and gender expression within Vodou culture, in the face of open hostility by mainstream Haitian society.  Haitian views of homosexuality  Vodou is an ancestral religion, and viewed by some Western anthropologists as an ecstatic religion. It is not a fertility-based religion (see Fertility rites). This means that the majority of its members are not required by any religious law to reproduce, and homosexuals are not pressured to do so. Haitian Vodou views sexual orientation as a part of the way God makes a person; homosexuals are free to pursue members of the same sex just as heterosexuals are free to pursue members of the opposite sex.. In Haitian Vodou, male homosexuals are seen as under the protection of the Erzulie Freda, loa of love and beauty. She is very feminine, allowing gay men to exhibit stereotypical traits during religious ceremonies. The documentary \\"Des hommes et dieux\\" presents interviews with several people who feel Erzulie Freda made them gay. Erzulie Dantor is seen as the patron of lesbians, although she is herself bisexual having a lot of children and two husbands, Simbi Makaya and Ti Jean Petwo, though she is said to prefer the company of women. = Attacks after the 2010 earthquake = Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, there were verbal and physical attacks against vodou practitioners in Haiti, perpetrated by those who felt that, like homosexuals, vodouists were immoral and bore some responsibility for the country's catastrophe. It is common knowledge in Haiti that a significant number of Haitian Vodou are gay. Many LGBT in Haiti believe that it is easier to be open about one's sexuality and gender expression within Vodou culture, in the face of open hostility by mainstream Haitian society.  Opposing views in non-Haitian based Vodou  There are, however, views among other Vodou practitioners that overt identification as homosexuals has no place within the tradition. The leader of Le Peristyle Haitian Sanctuary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, asserts that there is no connection between the Loa and gender complexity, and states that \\"...your gender identification is your business. But you cannot evoke God to satisfy your sexual desires. We have suffered this kind of abuse of African-based religions long enough. It is time for it to stop.\\"Quoted in Randy P. Conner, David Hatfield Sparks, Queering Creole Spiritual Traditions: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Participation in African-Inspired Traditions in the Americas, Haworth Press, 2004, pg 98. Similarly, the website for Mami Wata West African Diaspora Vodoun, based in the southern United States, notes that elders in the Vodoun religion are generally against initiating homosexuals. The Mami Wata organization itself followed this exclusionary practice until recently, but now welcomes all practitioners.Common Misconceptions About Vodoun: Category: Gays & Lesbians Mami Wata Healers Society of North America Inc.  Relationship between Loa and gender identity  During Haitian Vodou ceremonies, the houngans (priests), mambos (priestesses), and hounsis (initiates) dance around a poteau-mitan until one of them becomes possessed by one of the Loa. A person can be possessed by any Loa, regardless of whether they are the same gender or not .. During possession, the possessed dancer will begin to behave like the loa they are possessed by, regardless of gender. Reverend Severina KM Singh, a New Orleans Voodoo priestess explains, > I have gay friends who practice and I can personally attest to the closeness > of the Loa to them. I have witnessed wonderful and powerful rituals which > they led. The intent in your heart matters more than your sexual > orientation. I read for very many gay people and make offerings for them > without any qualms at all. Voodooist believe in the transmigration of the > soul. That means my soul could have been in a black male body at one time > and an oriental female body at another time, not to mention the millions of > lives spent in lower life forms. Some of them probably quite asexual or > bisexual or transsexual! Beliefs Depiction of Baron Samedi, a bisexual lwa. A large number of spirits or deities (lwa) exist in Haitian and Louisiana Voodoo. These lwa may be regarded as families of individuals or as a singular entity with distinct aspects, with links to particular areas of life. Some lwa have particular links with magic, ancestor worship or death such as the Ghedes and Barons. A number of these are further particularly associated with transgenderism or same-sex interactions.Conner, p. 157, \\"Ghede\\" These include Ghede Nibo, a spirit caring for those who die young. He is sometimes depicted as an effeminate drag queen and inspires those he inhabits to lascivious sexuality of all kinds, especially transgender or lesbian behaviour in women.Conner, p. 157, \\"Ghede Nibo\\" Ghede Nibo's parents are Baron Samedi and Maman Brigitte; Baron Samedi is the leader of the Ghedes and Barons and is depicted as bisexual dandy or occasionally transgender, wearing a top-hat and frock coat along with a woman's skirt and shoes. Samedi has a tendency toward \\"lascivious movements\\" that cross gender boundaries and also imply a lust for anal sex.Conner, p. 83, \\"Baron Samedi\\" Other barons displaying gay behaviour are Baron Lundy and Baron Limba, who are lovers and teach a type of homoerotic nude wrestling at their school, believed to increase magical potency.Conner, p. 83, \\"Baron Limba\\" & \\"Baron Lundy\\" Baron Oua Oua, who often manifests with a childlike aspect, has been called the baron \\"most closely linked to homosexuality\\" by Voodoo practitioners.Conner, p. 83, \\"Baron Oua Oua\\" Another lwa, Erzulie, is associated with love, sensuality and beauty. Erzulie can manifest aspects that are LGBT-related, including transgender or amazonian traits, in addition to traditionally feminine guises. When inhabiting men, these aspects can result in transgender or homoerotic behaviour, whereas they may result in lesbianism or anti-male sentiment in women. Erzulie Freda is seen as the protector of gay men, and Erzulie Dantor is associated with lesbians.Conner, p. 135, \\"Erzulie\\"  See also   Further reading  * AIDS, fear, and Society: Challenging the Dreaded Disease; Kenneth J.

Phil.) is an epistle attributed to Polycarp, an early bishop of Smyrna, and addressed to the early Christian church in Philippi.Catholic Encyclopedia: St Polycarp It is widely believed to be a composite of material written at two different times (see ), in the first half of the second century.Early Christian Writings on Polycarp. Raymond Brown (Introduction to the New Testament, 1997) p. 665 estimates 120-30. The epistle is described by Irenaeus as follows: : There is also a forceful epistle written by Polycarp to the Philippians, from which those who wish to do so, and are anxious about their salvation, can learn the character of his faith, and the preaching of the truth.James Stevenson, A new Eusebius (London: SPCK, 1965), p. 120 The epistle is one of a number believed to have been written by Polycarp, but is the only extant document.Kirsopp Lake The Apostolic Fathers Volume 1. (London: Heinemann, 1912), pp. 280-281. It was composed in Greek, but the Greek text has not been preserved in its entirety; there is also a Latin translation of the epistle.On the Greek and Latin manuscript witnesses to the Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, see Moreover, a few quotations of it are preserved in Syriac.Timothy B. Sailors, \\"Quotations of Polycarp‚Äôs Letter to the Philippians Preserved in Syriac,\\" The Harp: A Review of Syriac, Oriental and Ecumenical Studies 27 (2012) pp. 335-342 Authorship and unity Scholars generally agree that Pol. Phil. is an authentic epistle of Polycarp. One potential objection to the authenticity of the epistle, however, is the apparent chronological inconsistency between Chapters 9 and 13. In Chapter 9, Polycarp shows that he is fully aware that his friend Ignatius has suffered martyrdom, perhaps some time ago: But in Chapter 13, Polycarp references a letter sent to him by Ignatius quite recently (see the Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp), and seems to be unaware of Ignatius' ultimate fate: Various efforts have been made to explain this seeming discrepancy. A minority of scholars, starting with Reinhard H√ºbner and Thomas Lechner, have proposed that Chapter 13 is an interpolation by a later author. These scholars argue that the epistles attributed to Ignatius are forgeries, and that this interpolation was used to help authenticate them. Most scholars, however, do not accept the view of H√ºbner and Lechner. The most widely accepted proposal was put forward by Pearcy Neale Harrison in 1936, in which he argued that the epistle is actually a composite of two authentic letters of Polycarp written at different times. =The two letters= The first letter, written just before Ignatius' death, would consist of Chapter 13 and possibly also Chapter 14. It would have served as a short Cover Letter for the epistles of Ignatius, to which it refers explicitly: The second letter, written many years later, would constitute the bulk of the epistle (Chapters 1-12). P. N. Harrison named this letter the Crisis Letter, because it seems to have been written in response to a crisis in the Philippian church, in which its presbyter Valens was removed from his post for \\"covetousness\\" (Chapter 11). These two letters would have been compiled together, either accidentally or intentionally, by a later editor. This view, or some variation of it, continues to enjoy widespread support among scholars, although some continue to argue for the unity of the epistle. Date Scholars' estimates for the Cover Letter (Pol. Phil. 13) are largely dependent on the dating of the epistles of Ignatius, to which they explicitly refer. Traditionally, the Ignatian epistles are dated to around the year 108 AD during the reign of the Roman emperor Trajan, based on the writings of the 4th century church historian Eusebius of Caesarea.Chronicle, from the Latin translation of Jerome, p. 276. However, several modern scholars have questioned this view, arguing for a date in the 130s or 140s AD (see Ignatius of Antioch). In that case, the Cover Letter would be dated correspondingly later. The Crisis Letter (Pol. Phil. 1-12) would date some time after Ignatius' death, but it is unclear precisely how much later it might have been written. Polycarp's death, which occurred around 155-167 AD, sets an upper limit. P. N. Harrison, who accepted the traditional Trajanic date of the epistles of Ignatius, dated the Crisis Letter to around 135-137 AD If one accepts the minority view that Pol. Phil. is a unified letter, then the epistle as a whole would date to around the same time as the epistles of Ignatius of Antioch. Content The epistle warns against a number of disorders in the church and against apostasy, and encourages the Christians to persevere in good works. It also acted as a covering letter for a collection of writings by Ignatius of Antioch, whose works were being collected by the church at Philippi after Ignatius' visit there.Glenn Davis, The Development of the Canon of the New Testament Here is one quotation from the epistle: One of the epistle's more important features is its use and citation of other early Christian writings, many of which later came to be part of the New Testament. The epistle has even been described as \\"pastiche-like\\" due to its heavy use of allusions and citations to other writings, which make up a large portion of the text. =Identity of the \\"heretics\\"= In Chapter 7, Polycarp exhorts the Philippians to reject various heretical doctrines, but never mentions any particular heretics by name. For example, he attacks docetism, the belief that Jesus did not appear on Earth in the flesh, by citing the First Epistle of John: (\\"For whosoever does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is an antichrist\\"). He also attacks unnamed individuals who claim that \\"there is neither a resurrection nor a judgment,\\" calling them \\"the first-born of Satan\\" (Pol. Phil. 7.1). Importantly, the Christian apologist Irenaeus of Lyon claimed in his book Against Heresies that Polycarp had called the unorthodox Christian thinker Marcion of Sinope \\"the first-born of Satan.\\" This led P. N. Harrison to conclude that Polycarp was in fact referring to Marcion in this epistle, albeit at an early stage in Marcion's ideological development. Many other scholars, however, have found Harrison's argument to be unconvincing. References Bibliography *Richardson, C. C. ed. Early Christian Fathers. Philadelphia.

From 1964 to 1970 it was the home of George Harrison, lead guitarist of the Beatles. It was where many of the demo recordings for the band's 1968 self-titled double album (also known as the \\"White Album\\") were made. The bungalow has since been demolished, and another house built in its place. Purchase by Harrison Harrison bought Kinfauns for ¬£20,000 () on 17 July 1964, on the advice of Dr Walter Strach, the Beatles' accountant. Going house-hunting, Harrison said later, \\"It was the first one I saw, and I thought, that'll do.\\" He was joined there months later by his girlfriend Pattie Boyd. Harrison and Boyd were married on 21 January 1966, and lived in the house until 1970, when Harrison purchased Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Renovation During 1967, Harrison and Boyd, with a little help from their friends, painted the outside of the house in psychedelic patterns; a mural around the fireplace was created by design collective the Fool, who also painted several Beatles musical instruments and Harrison's Mini. At the rear of the house was a guitar shaped swimming pool. Gold discs and the multiple awards the band had achieved adorned the sitting room walls. In front, a tall sliding door kept unauthorised visitors out of the garden. The door was soon covered in fans' signatures and autographs. Beatles gatherings Kinfauns was probably the home the Beatles gathered at most, as it was only a short drive from the homes of John Lennon (Kenwood) and Ringo Starr (Sunny Heights), both in St George's Hill. It was where Harrison, Lennon and their wives retreated during their first LSD experience in 1965, and in May 1968 it was where many of the demo recordings for the White Album were made, on Harrison's Ampex four-track tape recorder. These demos have been released on various bootleg albums; seven of them also appear on the Beatles' Anthology 3 compilation album. Harrison was the first Beatle to own or use a Moog synthesizer, and he recorded \\"Under the Mersey Wall\\" with his Moog at Kinfauns. The track filled one side of his Electronic Sound album, released in May 1969. Kinfauns was where police arrested Boyd and Harrison in March 1969, for hashish possession, as Lennon and Yoko Ono had been months earlier while staying at Starr's flat at Montagu Square in London. Both couples insisted the drugs found had been planted on the premises. Sale and demolition After moving to Friar Park, Harrison sold Kinfauns; both houses were listed as assets of the Beatles' company Apple Corps. It was later home of songwriters Barry and Sylvan Mason (n√©e Whittingham) who composed hits such as \\"Delilah\\" for Tom Jones, \\"Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes\\" (Edison Lighthouse, 1970) and \\"We Don't Belong\\" (Sylvan, 1965). The site of Kinfauns lies within the historic garden walls of the adjacent Claremont, a 19th-century royal residence. Following a series of planning applications in the early 21st century the bungalow was substantially demolished and replaced with a new two- storey house.

It is the unit commonly used when following the US Customary System, a collection of standards set by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. Another unit used for the same purpose is the standard cubic meter, customary when using SI units. Definitions A standard cubic foot defines an amount of gas contained in a volume of one cubic foot at standard temperature and pressure. This standard unit of molecular quantity for gases can be used with the ideal gas law to compute the quantity per unit of volume for other pressures and temperatures. In spite of the label \\"standard\\", there is a variety of definitions, mainly depending on the type of gas. Since, for a given volume, the quantity is proportional to the pressure and temperature, each definition fixes base values for pressure and temperature. =Natural gas= Since natural gas is an imprecise mix of various molecular species, chiefly methane but with varying proportions of other gases, a standard cubic foot of natural gas does not represent a precise unit of mass, but a molecular quantity, expressed in moles. For petroleum gases, the standard cubic foot (scf) is defined as one cubic foot of gas at and at normal sea level air pressure. The pressure definition differs between sources, but are all close to normal sea level air pressure. * A pressure of . This is the same pressure as the SI system standard pressure. Gives 1.1953 moles per scf. * A pressure of . Gives 1.1956 moles per scf. * A pressure . This value is very close to 30 inches of mercury. Gives 1.1981 moles per scf or 0.002641 pound moles per scf. The standard cubic meter of gas (scm) is used in the context of the SI system. It similarly defined as the quantity of gas contained in a cubic meter at a temperature of and a pressure of . Converting volume units between the standard cubic foot and the standard cubic meter is not exact, as the base temperature and pressure used are different, but for most practical situations the difference can be ignored. Comparing the same volume between the and 101.325 kPa standard cubic meter versus the and standard cubic foot gives an error of 0.04%. A standard cubic foot in the US Customary System is approximately equivalent to 0.02833 standard cubic meters in the SI system. In the natural gas industry, where quantities are often expressed in standard cubic feet, large multiples of standard cubic feet are generally not expressed with metric prefixes, but rather with prefixes based on roman numerals, where the s for \\"standard\\" is often omitted. Common units of gas volumes include ccf (hundred standard cubic feet), Mcf (thousand standard cubic feet), and MMcf (million standard cubic feet). The M refers to the Roman numeral for thousand, while two M's represent one thousand thousands, or one million. Bcf (billion standard cubic feet), Tcf (trillion standard cubic feet), Qcf (quadrillion standard cubic feet), etc., are also used. =Compressed or liquefied gases in refillable cylinders= The National Conference on Weights and Measures, a US- based non-profit organization working in cooperation with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, has defined a set of standards in a regulation entitled the \\"Uniform Regulation for the Method of Sale of Commodities\\". This regulation defines a standard cubic foot, for compressed or liquefied gases in refillable cylinders other than LPG by, \\"A standard cubic foot of gas is defined as a cubic foot at a temperature of 21 ¬∞C (70 ¬∞F) and a pressure of 101.325 kilopascals [kPa] (14.696 psia)\\". =Industrial gases= Yet other definitions are in use for industrial gas, where, in the US, a standard cubic foot for industrial gas use is defined at and 14.696 psia (101.325 kPa), while in Canada, a standard cubic meter for industrial gas use is defined at and 101.325 kPa (14.696 psia).  Converting actual volumes to standard volumes  An actual volume can be converted to a standard volume using the following equation: :Vs = Va √ó Fp √ó Ft √ó (Fpv)2 Where, :Vs: Standard Volume :Va: Actual Volume ( sometimes shown as Vr for Registered Volume ) :Fp: Pressure Factor ( sometimes shown as Pm for Pressure Multiplier ) ::Fp = Absolute Pressure / Standard Pressure = (Line Gauge Pressure + Atmospheric Pressure)/Base Pressure :Ft: Temperature Factor ( sometimes shown as Tm for Temperature Multiplier ) ::Ft = Absolute Standard Temperature / Absolute Line Temperature = [ 273.15 + Standard Temperature(deg C) ] / [ 273.15 + Line Temperature(deg C) ] or [ 459.67 + Standard Temperature(deg F) ] / [ 459.67 + Line Temperature(deg F) ] :Fpv: Super Compressibility Factor (often omitted or shown as equaling 1) Example: How many standard cubic feet are in 1 cubic foot of gas at 80 ¬∞F and 50 psig?

In 2016, however, Ian Martin of The Japan Times compared her output unfavorably with that of Utada Hikaru, describing Matsuda as \\"first and foremost an idol rather than an artist. Her legacy is best expressed in singles rather than albums.\\" Seiko once held the record for number-one hits from 1983 to 2000 (broken by B'z) and for solo artist (broken by Ayumi Hamasaki in 2006). Seiko was the overall finale performer of Kouhaku (Red White Music Battle) in 2014 and 2015, the prestigious NHK New Year's Eve Music show on which she has performed 21 times (until 2017). She is still actively releasing new singles and albums, doing annual summer concert tours, winter dinner shows, high-profile TV commercials and movies, and makes frequent TV appearances and radio broadcasts. In January 2011, the Japanese music television program Music Station listed her as the 2nd best-selling idol of all time in Japan, with 29,510,000 records sold. She placed right behind pop group SMAP and ahead of Akina Nakamori, her biggest rival from the 1980s, who was listed in third place.  Biography  After winning the 'Miss Seventeen' contest held by a popular magazine in 1978, a sixteen-year-old girl named Noriko Kamachi from Fukuoka adopted the stage name \\"Seiko Matsuda\\" and rose to fame in 1980 as a teen idol, making her debut with the song \\"Hadashi no Kisetsu\\" (lit. \\"Season of Bare Feet\\"). Later in the same year, her 3rd single \\"Kaze wa Aki-iro\\" (lit. \\"Wind Is Autumn Color\\") became the first of her 24 consecutive number 1 hits in Japan. She shattered the former Japanese record of nine consecutive number- ones by popular 1970s music duo Pink Lady. Her run of number-one records ended in 1989 when her 27th single \\"Precious Heart\\" ranked at number two, behind Tetsuya Komuro's \\"Gravity of Love\\". Matsuda had another number-one single \\"Anata ni Aitakute ~Missing You~\\" (lit. \\"I want to meet you ~Missing you~\\") in 1996, which would become her last number-one single to date. It was certified a million-seller by RIAJ. Matsuda held the record for the most number-one singles (25) and most consecutive number-one singles (24) on Japan's Oricon charts for 12 years, from 1988 to 2000. Both were surpassed by B'z in late 2000. She held the record for the most number-one singles (25) by a female singer for 18 years, from 1988 till 2006, when Ayumi Hamasaki's \\"Startin'/Born to Be...\\" became her 26th single to top the charts. Matsuda's held the record for the most consecutive number-one singles (24) by a female singer and any soloist for 22 years, from 1988 to 2010. It was broken by Hamasaki's \\"L\\" in September/October 2010. Matsuda also held records for the most top-ten albums (50) and most number-one albums. Both records have since been broken by Hamasaki. Matsuda was the first artist to have a single and an album debut at No. 1 on the Oricon Chart in the same week. So far, this has only happened three times. In a May 2011 an Oricon survey crowned her the No. 1 everlasting idol of all time, beating Momoe Yamaguchi (2), Ky≈çko Koizumi (3), Morning Musume (4) and Akina Nakamori (5). Her long staying power is mainly due to her continuous re-invention of herself. She was labeled a 'Mamadol' (idol who remains popular even after having children). Her hair styles, fashion sense and makeup have all been copied by millions of girls and women in Japan and in certain parts of Asia.http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/ranking/88127/full/ Matsuda's voice and singing technique have won her two best performance awards from Nippon Record Awards, first in 1983 for „Ç¨„É©„Çπ„ÅÆÊûóÊ™é (lit. Glass Apple) and again in 1993 for '„Åç„Å£„Å®„ÄÅ„Åæ„ÅüÈÄ¢„Åà„Çã„Éª„Éª„Éª' (lit. Surely, will meet again). Matsuda began to write her songs by herself. She wrote lyrics for the first time when she produced her song \\"Chiisana Love Song\\" (lit. \\"Small Love Song\\") in 1983. This was followed by her first composed song \\"Canary\\". All music and lyrics of her 2007 album Baby's Breath were written by herself. It became her first completely self-produced album. Matsuda attempted to break into the North American market with an English-language, self-titled album in 1990. She managed to score a hit ‚Äì \\"The Right Combination\\", a duet with boy band New Kids on the Block singer Donnie Wahlberg. The album sales were mediocre, and her follow-up Was it the Future failed to generate significant sales. In 2002, however, Matsuda's English dance hits \\"All to You\\" and \\"Just for Tonight\\" managed to reached the Billboard dance chart at No. 8 and No. 2, respectively. In July 2006, Matsuda's compilation album Seiko Matsuda, which consisted of 74 CDs, debuted at number 96, becoming the highest-priced album in the Oricon history at the price of 100,000 yen (about 850 dollars). Hibari Misora, a well-known enka singer from the 1950s held the previous record with her 1989 album Ky≈ç no Ware ni Asu wa Katsu (60,000 yen). Although some up-and-coming female singers like Namie Amuro and Hamasaki became successful after the end of the 1980s, most \\"typical\\" pop idols from Matsuda's era disappeared as the golden age of idols began to fade away, except Matsuda, who was still going strong, releasing single after single. She has been a secret idol for subsequent female celebrities such as Shoko Nakagawa who called Matsuda \\"God\\" and \\"My Universe\\". Japanese voice actress Nana Mizuki released her cover version of Matsuda's \\"Akai Sweet Pea\\" (lit. \\"Red Sweet Pea\\") as the B-side of an image song single under the character name Moka Akashiya of the anime Rosario + Vampire on 14 February 2008. There are endless cover version of Matsuda songs and tribute albums being released every year. Among those 'Diamond Eyes', 'Missing You' and 'Akai Sweet Pea' (lit. Red Sweet Pea) and Sweet Memories have been reinterpreted by other artists countless times, including a cover performance by Akina Nakamori.http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20101113-00000679-bark-musi On 5 August 2009, Sony re-released 16 of Matsuda's early albums under the Blu-spec CD format. Thirteen of these entered the Oricon Top 100 Album Chart at the same time, surpassing the record set by Hibari Misora (12 albums) and making her the first female artist to do so. Matsuda is also on the Top 3 list of Most No.1 albums, Most Top 10 singles and Most Top 10 albums for a solo artist. HMV Japan ranked her No. 10 Top Japanese Artist of All Time, and No. 7 Top Singer of All Time. Matsuda still holds annual concerts, Christmas dinner shows and New Year's Eve Countdown shows. Despite the high ticket prices (her dinner show tickets are the most expensive among female artists) for many years and to this day,http://zasshi.news.yahoo.co.jp/article?a=20101112-00000014-pseven-int she always performs to a sold-out crowd. Matsuda is also listed as second only behind Eikichi Yazawa as an artist to have performed many concerts at the Nippon Budokan. Matsuda made a guest appearance on one of Fox Broadcasting Company's popular TV dramas \\"Bones\\" in 2010. In 2011, she was invited to performed in American music producer Quincy Jones's concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. She also performed as a guest vocalist on the album \\"Esprit De Four\\" by the contemporary Jazz super-group Fourplay, released worldwide on 18 September 2012 In 2015, Matsuda won the Japanese equivalent of a Grammy Award when she received Best Vocal Performance at the Japan Record Awards, the most prestigious award in the Japan music industry.  Personal life  In 1983, Seiko was romantically linked with singer, Hiromi Go. Although there were rumours of an impending engagement, Go's traditional values would have required Seiko to give up her singing career and focus on raising a family instead. Momoe Yamaguchi, Japan's top female idol of the 1970s, had followed such a course, but Seiko ended her relationship with Go instead. Her break from tradition set a precedent for Japanese women in the 1980s and 1990s to continue their careers even after marriage. Matsuda has been married three times. She was married to actor, Masaki Kanda, from 1985 to 1997. Their only child and daughter, Sayaka Kanda, is also a singer. Her second husband, Hiroyuki Hatano, was a dentist to who she was married from 1998 to 2000. On 13 June 2012, she announced her marriage to university associate professor, Hiromasa Kawana, on her official website. In addition to music, Matsuda's career include appearances in film, radio, and television. Along with other books about Matsuda and several books of her photos including Five Seasons, No Comments, Akai Sweet Pea, have been published. Matsuda has appeared in numerous commercials, such as numerous Ezaki Glico products, Minolta, Sony, Diosa Hair Color, Suntory, DirecTV, NTT DoCoMo, Astalift, Kanebo, Doctor Drive, Takano Yuri, Alba, and Shiseido. In 2015, Matsuda caused a stir in the Japanese entertainment industry when she modelled for lingerie company, Triumph International. Minako Honda was her cousin.

During the British Raj, the area had a tea plantation, one of four in the Kumaon area at that time.A tea garden at Sath Tal, 1895 photograph British Library The lakes sit at an altitude of 1370 metres below lush orchards in the Mehragaon valley. Set amongst dense forests of oak and pine trees, Sattal is one of the few unspoiled and unpolluted freshwater biomes in India. These lakes are a paradise for migratory birds. It is home to a few camps being operated mostly by local people catering to tourists looking for outdoor vacations. Geology and physiography Sattal is situated in the Lower Himalayan Range and is the result of tectonic activities and the uplifting of sediments between the Tibetan plain and the Indo-Gangetic plains. The rocks are mainly sedimentary rocks and quartzite. Physiographically the area can be divided into lower Himalayas and terraces. =Ecology= Sattal is an ecologically fragile mesotrophic group of lakes and under the impact of heavy environmental degradation. Extensive deforestation, dumping of non-biodegradable waste, uncontrolled urbanization of the catchments and nearby forest is harming the ecology of the area. This results in scanty rainfall, a decrease in the number of plant and animal species and rapid drying up of perennial springs. The lakes also suffer from a reduced oxygen content and high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. Poaching has eliminated many wild animals. Khudariya Tal became Sukha Tal (Dry Lake) due to the leakage of water from its western extremity. An extensive growth of invasive plants such as Lantana, Parthenium and Eichhornia is also endangering the ecological survival of the lakes. Flora and fauna =Biological diversity= Sattal is unique for its biodiversity and ecological amplitude. It has 500 species of resident and migratory birds, 20 species of mammals, over 525 species of butterflies and over 11,000 species of moths, beetles, bugs and other insects. The flora covers a wide and diverse range of plants ranging from Bryophytes, orchids, rare climbing plants, ferns, lichens, fungi, medicinal herbs and shrubs. Each individual lake has its own unique Diatom index. The Trophic Diatom Index uses the composition of freshwater diatom assemblages to assess water quality and ecological status. =Birds= Himalayan griffon Verditer Flycatcher at Sattal The unique avian fauna of Sattal includes red-billed blue magpie, kingfishers, blue-throated and brown- headed barbets, lineated barbet, golden-throated barbet, crimson-fronted barbet, coppersmith barbet plum-headed parakeet, slaty-headed parakeet, chestnut bellied rock thrush, tits, babblers, jungle owlet, pied woodpecker, brown-capped pygmy woodpecker, grey-capped pygmy woodpecker, brown-fronted woodpecker, stripe-breasted woodpecker, yellow-crowned woodpecker, rufous- bellied woodpecker, crimson-breasted woodpecker, Himalayan woodpecker, lesser yellownape woodpecker, greater yellow-naped woodpecker, streak-throated woodpecker, grey-headed woodpecker, scaly-bellied woodpecker, common flameback woodpecker, Indian tree pies, blue whistling-thrush, lammergeier, Himalayan griffon, crested serpent eagle, flycatchers, \\\\ , Kalij pheasant, , dollarbird, leaf birds, flowerpecker, purple sunbird, brown headed stork-billed kingfisher, stork-billed kingfisher, crested kingfisher, white-throated kingfisher, pied kingfisher, common kingfisher, blue-eared kingfisher, Himalayan kingfisher, Mrs. Gould's sunbird, green-tailed sunbird, black- throated sunbird, black-breasted sunbird, crimson sunbird, fire-tailed sunbird, thick-billed flowerpecker, plain-leaf flowerpecker, fire-breasted flowerpecker, russet sparrow, rufous babbler, black-headed jay, scaly-breasted cupwing, black-capped sibia, blue whistling thrush, finches, mountain hawk eagle, black eagle, Eurasian jay, white-rumped needletail, black-headed jay, black-lored, black-throated tits, black bulbul, ashy-throated warblers, black- chinned babbler, rufous-breasted accentor, red-billed blue magpie, grey-winged blackbird, Eurasian griffon, common buzzard, black-chinned babbler, pink- browed rosefinch, common wood pigeon, slaty-headed parakeet, laughingthrush, chestnut-tailed minla, lemon-rumped warblers, and many more. =Fish= Sattal has many different varieties of fish. Mahseers (Tor tor and Tor putitora) are found here in large numbers. Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala, Schizothorax richardsonii and Catla catla are some of the other fish found in the lakes. =Butterflies= Argynnis butterfly Indian oakleaf or dead leaf at Sattal Some of the butterflies found at Sattal includes Indian fritillary (Argynnis hyperbius), peacock pansy, blue peacock, Paris peacock, red-base Jazebel, red lacewing, yellow pansy, tawny Rajah, red Helen, large silverstripe, Indian oakleaf and thousands of others. Adventure and excursions =Butterfly museum= There is a butterfly museum built by Frederic Smetacek at Jones Estate, which has over 2500 butterfly and moth specimens and 1100 species of insects that are found in this region. =Sattal Mission Estate and Methodist Ashram= The Sattal Christian Ashram was established by E. Stanley Jones (1884-1973), the evangelist and missionary. This Christian Ashram is situated on the banks of Sattal lakes, on a former tea estate. St. John's Church is part of this ashram and showcases a mixed colonial architecture. There is also a Sattal Christian Ashram chapel situated nearby. It was established in 1930 to introduce Christianity into the Kumaun region of Uttarakhand. =Subhash Dhara= There is a natural spring of fresh water arising out of dense oak forest west of Sattal.

Recording \\"The Rain Song\\" is a ballad of over seven minutes in length. Guitarist Jimmy Page originally constructed the melody of this song at his home in Plumpton, England, where he had recently installed a studio mixing console. A new Vista model, it was partly made up from the Pye Mobile Studio which had been used to record the group's 1970 Royal Albert Hall performance and The Who's Live at Leeds album.Dave Lewis (1994), The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin, Omnibus Press, . With a working title of \\"Slush\\", a reference to its easy listening simulated orchestral arrangement, Page was able to bring in a completed arrangement of the melody, for which singer Robert Plant composed the words. Plant ranks his vocal performance on the track as one of his best.Austin Scaggs, Q&A;: Robert Plant, Rolling Stone, May 5, 2005. The song also features a Mellotron played by John Paul Jones to add to the orchestral effect, while Page plays a Danelectro guitar. George Harrison was reportedly the inspiration for \\"The Rain Song\\" when he made a comment to Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, about the fact that the group never wrote any ballads.Brad Tolinski (2012), Light & Shade Conversations Jimmy Page, Crown Publishing Group, In Light and Shade: Conversations with Jimmy Page, biographer Brad Tolinski quotes Page: However, there is some disagreement about exactly what was said by whom. Live history During Led Zeppelin concerts from late 1972 until 1975, the band played this song immediately following \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", presenting the songs in the same order as they appeared on the album. They organized their set list in this manner because Page used a Gibson EDS-1275 double-necked guitar for both songs: the top, 12-string neck for \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" and then switching to the bottom, 6-string neck for \\"The Rain Song\\". Often, the band would perform the song in the key of A major, a whole step up from the studio version (as heard on The Song Remains the Same). The song was dropped from the 1977 U.S. tour, but returned for Led Zeppelin's 1979 concerts in Copenhagen, Denmark and at the Knebworth Music Festival, as well as their European tour in 1980. \\"The Rain Song\\" was the only song from Houses of the Holy performed on the 1980 European tour. In this incarnation, Page again utilized the double- neck, the only known time he used that guitar solely for the 6-string portion without using the 12-string portion on a preceding song. For all live versions of the song, the orchestral string sounds were played by Jones on either the mellotron (1972‚Äì1975) or a Yamaha synthesizer (1979‚Äì1980), as Led Zeppelin never utilised a string section on-stage. Reception In a contemporary review for Houses of the Holy, Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone gave \\"The Rain Song\\" a negative review, describing this track and \\"No Quarter\\" as \\"nothing more than drawn-out vehicles for the further display of Jones' unknowledgeable use of mellotron and synthesizer.\\" In a retrospective review of Houses of the Holy (Deluxe Edition), Kristofer Lenz of Consequence of Sound gave \\"The Rain Song\\" a more positive review, describing the track as \\"one of the most sentimental tracks in Led Zeppelin‚Äôs catalog\\", along with calling it \\"patient and beautifully arranged\\". Lenz further wrote that Plant's lyrics and vocals \\"infuse a sense of humanity, loss, and transcendence ‚Äì a touch of emotional maturity.\\" Record producer Rick Rubin says, \\"I don't even know what kind of music this is [\\"The Rain Song\\"]. It defies classification. There's such tasteful, beautiful detail in the guitar, and a triumphant feel when the drums come in ‚Äî it's sad and moody and strong, all at the same time. I could listen to this song all day. That would be a good day.\\"The Playlist Special: Fifty Artists Pick Their Personal Top 10s . Rolling Stone. Retrieved 2 January 2011.  Other versions  A different version of this song is featured on the second disc of the remastered 2CD deluxe edition of Houses of the Holy. Titled \\"The Rain Song (Mix Minus Piano)\\", it was recorded on 18 May 1972 at the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio at Stargroves with engineer Eddie Kramer and mix engineer Keith Harwood.

He played Gaelic football with his local club Beale, his divisional side Shannon Rangers and was a member of the Kerry senior inter-county team from 1978 until 1993. Liston is regarded as one of the greatest full-forwards in the history of the game. Playing career =Club= Liston played his club football with his local club called Beale. He lined out in the county championship with Shannon Rangers. In 1977 he was a member of the side that defeated Feale Rangers to take the county senior championship title. It was Liston's only victory in the county championship. =Minor and under-21= He never played minor football for Kerry. By the late 1970s Liston had joined the Kerry under-21 football team. He captured a Munster title in this grade in 1977 following a two-goal defeat of Cork. Liston's side later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Down providing the opposition. A 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì5 score line gave Kerry the victory and gave Liston an All-Ireland winners' medal. In 1978 Liston made it two Munster under-21 titles in-a-row as Kerry retained their provincial crown at the expense of Cork. He later lined out in a second All-Ireland final. Roscommon provided the opposition on that occasion, however, a close game developed. At the final whistle Kerry were defeated by 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8. =Senior= Liston made his senior inter-county debut with Kerry in 1978, and it proved to be a successful year. Kerry faced little competition in the provincial championship once again. A defeat of Cork gave Liston a Munster winners'. Kerry later qualified for a third All-Ireland final in four years, with Liston playing at full-forward in his first championship decider. Old rivals Dublin provided the opposition, however, the game turned into a rout. The game is chiefly remembered for Mikey Sheehy's sensational goal. The Kerry forward lobbed the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen, who was caught off his line arguing with the referee. Liston announced his arrival on the inter-county scene and scored a hat-trick of goals. Pat Spillane played all over the field, including goalkeeper after Charlie Nelligan was sent off. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the winners by 5‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì9. In 1979 Kerry made it five-in-a-row in Munster as Cork fell by ten points in the provincial final. It was Liston's second Munster title. He later went in search of a second consecutive All- Ireland medal. Dublin provided the opposition for the fifth consecutive occasion. Kerry were handicapped throughout the game. Ger Power did not start the game, while John O'Keeffe got injured and P√°id√≠ √ì S√© was sent off during the encounter. Two goals by Mikey Sheehy and a third by John Egan helped 'the Kingdom' to a 3‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì8 victory. It was Liston's second All-Ireland winners' medal.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 404‚Äì405 Kerry's dominance continued in 1980. Another defeat of Cork in the provincial final gave Liston a third Munster winners' medal in succession. Another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned, this time with Roscommon providing the opposition. The Connacht champions shocked Kerry and took a five-point lead inside the first twelve minutes. Mikey Sheehy popped up again to score the decisive goal, as Kerry went on to claim a 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì6 victory in a game that contained sixty-four frees.The GAA Book of Lists p. 405 The victory gave Kerry and Liston a third All-Ireland title in succession. In 1981 Liston won his fourth consecutive Munster title, before lining out in the All-Ireland final against Offaly. Kerry had an easy win with seven players combining for a great goal. He captured his fourth All- Ireland winners' medal that day as Kerry won by 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì8.The GAA Book of Lists p. 405 In 1982 Liston won his first National Football League medal before Kerry secured an eighth consecutive Munster final victory over Cork, giving him a fifth provincial winners' medal. The All-Ireland final pitted 'the Kingdom' against Offaly for the second year in-a-row. Kerry had the upper hand for much of the game and were leading by two points with two minutes left to be played. The game, however, was not over as Offaly substitute S√©amus Darby, who had entered the game almost unnoticed, produced the most spectacular of finishes by scoring a late goal. Kerry failed to score again to level the match and Offaly went on to win their third All-Ireland title ever. Kerry's five-in-a-row dream was shattered.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 405‚Äì406 Kerry missed out on an historic nine-in-a-row in Munster in 1983, as Cork finally triumphed. 'The Kingdom' bounced back the following year with Liston winning his second National League medal and his sixth Munster title. The centenary-year All-Ireland final pitted Kerry against old rivals and reigning champions Dublin. 'The Kingdom' dominated the game from start to finish. Only two Dublin forwards scored as Kerry ran out easy winners by 0‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì6. It was Liston's fifth All-Ireland winners' medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 406 Kerry made no mistake again in 1985. A two-goal victory over Cork gave Liston a seventh Munster winners' medal. Another All-Ireland final beckoned, with Dublin providing the opposition for a second consecutive year. Jack O'Shea scored a key goal after eleven minutes and Kerry stormed to a nine-point lead at half-time. 'The Dubs' came storming back with Joe McNally scoring two goals. The gap could not be bridged and Kerry won by 2‚Äì1 to 2‚Äì8.The GAA Book of Lists p. 406 The victory gave Liston an impressive sixth All-Ireland winners' medal. In 1986 Kerry's dominance showed no sign of disappearing. Cork fell again in the provincial final, giving Liston an eighth Munster title. An eighth All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed and it turned out to be an historic occasion. Tyrone provided the opposition in their first-ever championship decider. A Peter Quinn goal gave the Ulster men a six-point lead in the second-half, however, the game was far from over. Spillane ran fifty yards up the field for a hand-passed goal to get Kerry back on track. Mikey Sheehy scored a second goal to give 'the Kingdom' a 2‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì10 victory.The GAA Book of Lists p. 406 It was Liston's seventh All-Ireland medal. The glory days were now over for Kerry as Cork captured the next four Munster titles. Liston retired from inter-county activity, however, he was recalled to the squad in 1993. It was an unsuccessful year for Kerry and Liston entered into permanent retirement following Kerry's exit from the championship. =Inter- provincial= Liston also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial football competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out with his province in 1979, however, Munster were defeated on that occasion. Liston's side lost out again in 1980, however, in 1981 he won his first Railway Cup winners' medal as Connacht were accounted for. It was the first of two titles in-a-row for Munster and for Liston. He lined out in the next three inter- provincial campaigns also, however, Munster were defeated on all three occasions. Managerial career In retirement from playing Liston became involved in team management. In 2002 he guided Kerins O'Rahilly's to a defeat of Kilcummin and a first county title in forty-five years. Liston also served as a selector under Sean Boylan for the Irish compromise rules football teams in 2006 and 2008. He is also frequently touted as a possible future manager of the Kerry senior inter-county team.

During her career she was also billed as Marie Blake or Blossom MacDonald. Her younger sister was screen actress and singer Jeanette MacDonald. Rock is probably best known for her role as \\"Grandmama\\" on the 1960s horror sitcom The Addams Family. Personal life Blossom Rock was born on August 21, 1895, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the second of three daughters born to Anna May (n√©e Wright; July, 1871May 16, 1947) and Daniel MacDonald (April, 1869August 8, 1924). As a youth, she first performed in vaudeville with her younger sister, Jeanette. She had an elder sister, Elsie Wallace MacDonald (1894‚Äì1970), who had also been a vaudeville performer and then operated a dance school until 1962. She married actor Clarence Warren Rock, on September 26, 1926, in Manhattan, and they performed as a vaudeville act titled \\"Rock and Blossom\\" from 1925 to 1929. Clarence Rock died in 1960, and the couple had no children. Career Rock adopted the name Marie Blake for her film career, starting in 1937 with an uncredited appearance in My Dear Miss Aldrich. Her first credited major part was Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938), and she then played her most notable onscreen role as Sally, the hospital switchboard operator, in all nine pictures of MGM's Dr. Kildare film series from 1938 to 1942. She once had the same agent as Irene Ryan, whose similar career later caused Rock to fire him. Rock returned to using her real name in the 1950s, and later gained her biggest fame by playing \\"Grandmama\\" on the ABC series The Addams Family, which ran from 1964 to 1966. In October 1964, she made a public appearance in character at a haunted house at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. Illness and death Shortly after production on Season 2 of The Addams Family concluded in 1966, Rock suffered a stroke that affected her speech and prevented her from reuniting with fellow castmates for the 1977 television film Halloween with the New Addams Family. However, she watched the film from the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital. She died on January 14, 1978, in Los Angeles, California, at age 82, and was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

He published a memoir, An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean, which is one of the major sources of information about Tonga before it was influenced significantly by European cultures and Christianity. At age 14, Mariner was a ship's clerk aboard the British privateer Port au Prince. In 1806, while it was anchored off the Tongan island of Lifuka, in the Ha'apai island group, Port au Prince was seized by a chief named Fƒ´nau  ªUlukƒÅlala. Of the 26 crew members, 22 were killed, while the chief spared Mariner and three others. Mariner lived in Tonga for four years, and during this time he became known as Toki 'Ukamea (\\"Iron Axe\\"). After returning to England, he dictated a detailed account of his experiences, a description of Tongan society and culture, and a grammar and dictionary of the Tongan language.  Background and passage  The Port au Prince was an English private ship of war of 500 tons, armed with 24 long nine and twelve- pound guns, and eight 12-pound carronades on the quarter deck. She carried a \\"letter of marque\\" which permitted her captain and crew to become pirates against the enemies of England, primarily France and Spain. In return for their pirate raids, any plunder was to be their own. Commanded by Captain Duck, she sailed for the New World on 12February 1805, having been given a twofold commission by her owner, a MrRobert Bent of London: to attack the Spanish ships of the New World and capture gold and valuables, but if she failed in that task her secondary objective was to sail into the Pacific in search of whales to be rendered for oil. The Atlantic crossing was rough but uneventful, and she lay off the coast of Brazil by April and then rounded Cape Horn in July before proceeding north in search of Spanish galleons laden with treasure. They captured a number of ships, but most yielded little in the way of valuables, leading the disgruntled crew to contemptuously refer to their catches as \\"dung barges\\". The Port-au-Prince was also on the lookout for whales but, although catching a few, experienced little success.  Arrival in Tonga  After leaving Hawaii in September under the command of Mr.Brown, she intended to make port at Tahiti but missed it and instead sailed westward for the Tonga Islands. She arrived in Ha'apai on 9November 1806, almost two years since departing England and following numerous engagements, episodes of leaking badly, and the death of her captain. She was laden with the spoils of war and cargo amounting to approximately twelve thousand dollars, including a considerable amount of copper, silver, and gold ore. A large number of silver candlesticks, chalices, incense pans, crucifixes, and images was included in the treasure. The ship anchored in seven fathoms' water off the North West Point of Lifuka Island. A number of chiefs visited it on the evening of her arrival and brought barbecued hogs, yams, and a native of Hawaii who spoke some English and informed Captain Brown that the Tongans had friendly intentions. Finau, the chief of the Ha'apai, apparently took a liking to William Mariner, who reminded him of a son of his who had died of illness. However, the ship's Hawaiian crew members were uneasy and expressed their concerns to the captain that the Tongans were feigning friendliness while planning an attack. Captain Brown chose to ignore them. The next day, Tongans began to board until there were around 300 in different parts of the ship. They invited Captain Brown ashore to see the island and, assured of their friendly motives, he agreed. Upon reaching land, he was clubbed to death, stripped, and left lying in the sand. Simultaneously, the main attack commenced on the ship. The outnumbered sailors were easily overwhelmed. Finau had given instructions that the life of Mariner should be spared if at all possible. All but four of the crew members were clubbed to death, their heads so badly beaten as to be unrecognisable. For the next three days, the ship was stripped of her iron, a valuable commodity, and had her guns removed, before being burnt to the water line to more readily remove any remaining iron.  Sojourn in Tonga  Fƒ´nau assumed responsibility for Mariner, taking him under his protection. Mariner became known as Toki 'Ukamea (\\"Iron Axe\\") and spent the next four years living amongst the islanders, mostly in the northern island group of Vava ªu. During his sojourn, he learned the Tongan language and had significant contact with chief leaders in the Vava ªu island group. He witnessed Fƒ´nau's attempts to unify the islands using the seized cannons.  Account  In 1810, Mariner was rescued and returned to England. He related his story to John Martin, who authored the book An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Mariner gave a lively description of Fƒ´nau Fangup≈ç ( ªUlukƒÅlalaII), in particular. In one passage, Mariner quoted Fƒ´nau's opinion of the Western innovation of money: There are three major versions of Mariner's account. The original version was published in 1817 by John Murray,II, with the help of DrJohn Martin, who assumed authorship. Later editions appeared in England in 1818 and 1827, in Germany in 1819, and in the United States in 1820. The Vava'u Press of Tonga issued a new edition in 1981 that includes a biographical essay about Mariner, written by Denis Joroyal McCulloch, one of Mariner's great-great-grandsons, but leaves out the grammar and dictionary.

Monument of the Discoveries) is a monument on the northern bank of the Tagus River estuary, in the civil parish of Santa Maria de Bel√©m, Lisbon. Located along the river where ships departed to explore and trade with India and the Orient, the monument celebrates the Portuguese Age of Discovery (or Age of Exploration) during the 15th and 16th centuries. History Inauguration in 1960 with 32 ships of 14 nations. The monument was conceived in 1939 by Portuguese architect Jos√© √Çngelo Cottinelli Telmo, and sculptor Leopoldo de Almeida, as a temporary beacon during the Portuguese World Exhibition opening in June 1940. The Monument to the Discoveries represented a romanticized idealization of the Portuguese exploration that was typical of the Estado Novo regime of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar. It was originally constructed as a temporary construction, located in the Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio as part of an urban renewal project favoured by minister Duarte Pacheco, but with the resistance of Cottinelli Telmo. Yet, by June 1943, the original structure was demolished after the exposition as there was no concrete formalization of the project.This renewal project was actually forgotten after the death of the minister. On 3 February 1958, in decree No. 41-517, the government, through the Minist√©rio de Obras Publicas (Ministry of Public Works), the Overseas Provinces and the C√¢mara Municipal of Lisbon, promoted the intent to construct a permanent Monument to the Discoveries. Between November 1958 and January 1960, the new monument was constructed in cement and rose-tinted stone (from Leiria), and the statues sculpted from limestone excavated from the region of Sintra. The new project was enlarged from the original 1940 model as part of the commemorations to celebrate the fifth centennial of the death of Infante Henry the Navigator. Although the project was based on Cottinelli Telmo's plan, he was replaced after his death by Ant√≥nio Pardal Monteiro (as primary architect), and stability studies were completed under the direction of engineers Edgar Cardoso, Ruy Correia and Ant√≥nio Franco e Abreu. The interior plan was executed by Ant√≥nio Pardal Monteiro, who also worked with Cristino da Silva to plan the monumental square. The northern part of the property was completed by the firm Pardal Monteiro, while the southern area was completed by Jos√© Raimundo. The sculptures were modeled by Leopoldo de Almeida, with the assistance of sculptors Soares Branco and Ant√≥nio Santos, using models by Ant√≥nio C√¢ndido and Carlos Escobar (under the direction of Ant√≥nio Branco and Alfredo Henriques). Inaugurated on 9 August 1960, it was one of several projects nationwide that were intended to mark the Comemora√ß√µes Henriquinas (the celebrations marking the anniversary of the death of Henry the Navigator). Yet it was not completely finished until 10 October 1960, being transferred to the responsibility of the Administra√ß√£o Geral do Porto de Lisboa (General Administration of the Port of Lisbon). Although in 1962, an accord was signed with the C√¢mara Municipal of Lisbon to transfer its title, between 1960 and 1979 nothing was done with the monument. A document (Despacho No.57/P/79) published in the municipal journal (No. 13260, 5 November 1979) advanced the city's intention to produce a permanent exhibition, but it was only in 1985 that public works completed the cultural centre () which inaugurated public access to the top of the structure, in addition to creating spaces for an observation deck, auditorium and hall for exhibitions. In April 2003, the management of the Padr√£o dos Descobrimentos was placed in the custody of the public company Gest√£o de Equipamentos e Anima√ß√£o Cultural (EGEAC, E.E.M.). Architecture The compass rose and mappa mundi, a gift from the Union of South Africa created from beige, black and red limestone. Jer√≥nimos Monastery is in the background. The structure is located on the northern bank of the Tagus River, limited by the Bel√©m Marina, Alg√©s and Dafundo Nautical Centre and the Museum of Popular Art (), and demarcated by stone pedestals with armillary spheres. Opposite the large square, and across the Avenida da √çndia- Avenida de Bras√≠lia motorway, is the Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio (Empire Square) which fronts the Jer√≥nimos Monastery, Bel√©m Cultural Center and the green-spaces of the Jardim Vasco da Gama. The original structure, which Telmo, Barros and Almeida created, was erected in steel and cement, while the 33 statues were produced in a composite of plaster and tow. Ostensibly a slab standing vertically along the bank of the Tagus, the design takes the form of the prow of a caravel (ship used in the early Portuguese exploration). On either side of the slab are ramps that join at the river's edge, with the figure of Henry the Navigator on its edge. On either side of the Infante, along the ramp, are 16 figures (33 in total) representing figures from the Portuguese Age of Discovery. These great people of the era included monarchs, explorers, cartographers, artists, scientists and missionaries. Each idealized figure is designed to show movement towards the front (the unknown sea), projecting a direct or indirect synthesis of their participation in the events after Henry. The South African government was responsible for gifting the construction of the square in front of the monument: the Rosa-dos-Ventos (compass rose) was executed using different types of limestone, including lioz, a rare type of beige limestone found only around Lisbon, more specifically in Sintra. Designed by the architect Cristino da Silva, it includes a Mappa mundi that is 14 metres wide, showing the routes of Portuguese carracks and caravels during the Age of Discovery. On the northern fa√ßade flanking the staircase are two inscriptions in metal: on the left, \\"AO INFANTE D. HENRIQVE E AOS PORTVGVESES QVE DESCOBRIRAM OS CAMINHOS DO MAR\\" (To Prince Henry and the Portuguese that Discovered the Roads of the Sea) over a metal anchor; and, on the right, the words \\"NO V CENTEN√ÅRIO DO INFANTE D. HENRIQVE 1460 ‚Äì 1960\\" (On the Fifth centenary of Prince Henry 1460‚Äì1960), over a crown of laurel. The double staircase ascends one level, before the entranceway to the monument, allowing a perspective on the square and the lateral figures. The interior consists of three areas: the auditorium with space for 101 people, a stage of , with film projection booth; a secondary level with two halls for exhibition; and the last level with four rooms. Normally, the auditorium hosts a multimedia exhibition on the history of Lisbon, while the other rooms are used for exhibitions. The top of the monument (reached via a lift or stairs) offers views of the Tagus river, the Bel√©m neighbourhood and its many attractions, including the Bel√©m Tower and the Jer√≥nimos Monastery, which date from the Age of Discovery. =Statues= In addition to the main statue of Henry the Navigator, holding a model of a carrack, on either side of the ramps of the monument are a total of 33 figures from the history of the Discoveries, specifically (from right to left): { style=\\"background: transparent; margin: auto;\\" } ;Eastern profile Est√™v√£o da Gama (far left) and Ant√≥nio Abreu (far right), Bartolomeu Dias (centre left) and Diogo C√£o (centre right) raise a padr√£o/marker * Afonso V of Portugal * Vasco da Gama (discoverer of the sea route to India) * Afonso Gon√ßalves Baldaia (navigator) * Pedro √Ålvares Cabral (discoverer of Brazil) * Ferdinand Magellan (first to circumnavigate the globe) * Nicolau Coelho (navigator) * Gaspar Corte-Real (navigator) * Martim Afonso de Sousa (navigator) * Jo√£o de Barros (writer) * Est√™v√£o da Gama (sea captain) * Bartolomeu Dias (first to cross over the Cape of Good Hope) * Diogo C√£o (first to arrive to the Congo river) * Ant√≥nio de Abreu (navigator) * Afonso de Albuquerque (second viceroy of Portuguese India) * Saint Francis Xavier (missionary) * Crist√≥v√£o da Gama (captain) ;Western profile Detail showing Pedro Nunes holding an armillary sphere (center).

The company was founded in 1976 by Olivier Baussan with the purpose to create a company that celebrates and preserves the traditions of his native Provence. The company name means \\"the Occitan woman [in Provence]\\". In 2010, the company became listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. History IFC Mall, Hong Kong The storefront in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan In 1976, 23-year-old Olivier Baussan used steam distillation to produce essential oil from wild rosemaryOlivier Baussan, L'Occitane and lavender which he sold at open-air markets in his native Provence. L'Occitane was named for the women of Occitania. This area existed during the Middle Ages, spanning southern France, north-eastern Spain and northern Italy. Occitan was the native language and is still spoken as a second language in some areas of this region. In 1976, using an old soap factory that was donated to him, Olivier Baussan revived the traditional art of Marseille soap-making in Manosque, another Proven√ßal village. He manufactured vegetable-based soaps. The first L'Occitane factory and boutique opened in 1981 in Volx, a village in Provence. In the 1990s, Baussan sold a majority stake in the business to venture capitalists to finance expansion. As their approaches were incompatible, Baussan found himself excluded from daily management and strategic decision-making. In 1994, Austrian businessman Reinold Geiger bought a 33% stake in the group. Through a series of capital increases, Geiger became majority shareholder in 1996.\\"History, Culture and Corporate Structure\\" Listing Particulars: L'OCCITANE INt S.A. Geiger, as the new chairman, asked Baussan to return as creative director and lead product development. The company's new focus on marketing strategy paved the way for international expansion. In the late 1990s the company changed its name to 'L'Occitane en Provence', to strengthen the connection with the company's roots and because the term 'Provence' had more meaning to an international audience. On 20 April 2001, Clarins became a financial investor in the company through subscription to approximately 5.18% of the company's shares and ‚Ç¨11,433,750 convertible debenture loan. On 22 February 2005, Clarins further invested ‚Ç¨16,525,580 in convertible debentures. When the debentures were converted, Clarins held 23.33% of the shares. The management executed a leveraged buyout in May 2007 following which Reinold Geiger's stake rose from 31.9% to 48.7%, and Clarins' stake was diluted to 10.0%. L'Occitane has shops in over 90 countries, in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa; with 170 shops in the United States.Lee, Maggie.

Beauty products Lavender fields in Provence All of L'Occitane's products are developed and produced from its base in Manosque, where 1,000 employees work. The company sources the majority of its production from Provence and one of their main product l'Immortelle plants (Helichrysum italicum) from Corsica from producers who rely on traditional production methods. L'Occitane contributes to preserve traditional cultivation methods by: *Supporting the program to cultivate almond trees in the Alps of Haute- Provence. *Preserving certain rare species through the planting of their own field of Immortelle flowers in Corsica. *Developing partnerships with organisations that support the development of scented and aromatic plants, such as the Office National Interprofessionel des Plantes √† Parfum, and *Encouraging traditional cultivation, particularly that of lavender. A tin of L'Occitane shea Butter In addition to products sourced from Provence, shea butter is purchased directly from women's groups in Burkina Faso as Fair Trade with the 'Ecocert' certification. The shea tree is considered sacred, and its butter is known as \\"women's gold\\" because it is how the women make their money. Shea butter traditions are still used, such as only fallen fruit may be collected by women, and only women know the secret to making shea butter.Anthea De Lima (15 January 2004), p. 07, New Straits Times, Kuala Lumpur. According to the company, it does not conduct animal testing, and no animal product or by-product, except for beehive products are used in the manufacturing process. L'Occitane develops most of its products and ingredients in line with the organic cosmetics specifications of Ecocert. Melvita L'Occitane bought Groupe M&A; Development and its subsidiary, M&A; Sant√© Beaut√©, which includes the organic cosmetic brand Melvita, in 2008. The company, which was founded in the Ard√®che in 1983 by French biologist Bernard Chevilliat, commercialises ecological and organic cosmetics principally in France. In 1990, Melvita launched its first organic cosmetics range and its manufacturing obtained ECOCERT certification. They now have stores in thirteen countries.  The L'Occitane Foundation  La Fondation d'Entreprise L'Occitane is a private organisation founded in 2006 by the company, with a budget of 4 million euros for 6 years, to support visually impaired people and help the economic emancipation of women. It supports associations for the visually impaired particularly in Burkina Faso with NGOs that are specialised in training professionals to reduce blindness. The L'Occitane Foundation has formed a partnership with Orbis, an organisation that fights against avoidable blindness in developing countries. To support economic emancipation of women, the L'Occitane Foundation partnered with the association Faa-I-tuora to improve the way of living of people in Dissin, in the South West region of Burkina Faso. In 2013, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) decided to recognise L'Occitane en Provence as an exemplary company within the framework of its 2013 \\"Growing Inclusive Markets\\" initiative.United Nations Development Programme growinginclusivemarkets.org PDF Since 2013, L'Occitane Foundation has rewarded an ophthalmologist every two years for his work in the fight against blindness.

Staley Manufacturing Company (1922‚Äì1980s): Work with Soy founded a business of repacking and selling cornstarch under his own Cream brand in Baltimore in 1898. On 6 November 1906, he incorporated the business as A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company (A. E. Staley) in order to start his own production of food starch. In 1909, Gene Staley purchased an inoperative cornstarch plant in Decatur, Illinois.Business Policies & Decision Making Google Books He paid $45,000 and spent three years rebuilding and upgrading the plant with capital that he had raised from stockholders. The factory began processing on March 12, 1912.Augustus Eugene Staley ‚Äì Tate & Lyle A. E. Staley became one of the largest processors of corn in the United States, second only to Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), also based in Decatur, Illinois. It also processed soybeans under a partnership agreement with ADM at its Decatur, Illinois plant. ADM, through a subsidiary, owned 7.4% of A. E. Staley and would often assist A. E. Staley in filling corn syrup orders for CPC International when the company was in short supply of product. Both companies also had joint ventures producing corn sweeteners in Central America. A. E. Staley also produced many famous food and household brands including Cream Corn Starch, Staley Pancake and Waffle Syrup, Sta-Puf fabric softener, Sta-Flo liquid starch and Sno Bol toilet bowl cleaner. The food and household brands were subsequently sold to Purex Industries, Inc. in 1981. In 1985, A. E. Staley purchased CFS Continental, a wholesale grocery company, for $360 million. A. E. Staley stated a need to diversify away from bulk food processing. After the acquisition, A. E. Staley changed its name to Staley Continental, Inc. (until 1993). Nordlund: man behind Staley-CFS Continental deal ‚Äì Donald Nordlund Nation's Restaurant News, Nov 5, 1984 by Don Jeffrey Retrieved February 9, 2011 In 1988, British company Tate & Lyle acquired 90% of A. E. Staley for $1.42 billion. Prior to the purchase, Tate & Lyle announced that it planned to sell CFS Continental to SYSCO, another wholesale grocer, for $700 million to help fund the acquisition. In 2000, Tate & Lyle acquired the remaining 10% of the company. In 2005, the company changed its name to Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas LLC. 1993 labor lockout controversy On Sunday, June 27, 1993, A. E. Staley officials decided to lock out A. E. Staley employees who were members of the Allied Industrial Workers of America Union. The lockout incident was the result of nearly a decade of labor disputes between management and Staley's unionized workers. The decline in pay and wages began in 1985 when A. E. Staley merged with Continental Foods, forming Staley Continental. During the next three years, the union was forced to make concessions as management was concerned about the plant remaining viable. Base pay was frozen at $10.80 per hour and workers complained of long overtime hours and declining safety conditions. After London based Tate & Lyle purchased A. E. Staley in 1988, conditions got worse for the factory workers. In 1989, contract negotiations began for a new three- year contract. While the bargaining committee was hoping to end the salary freeze and improving safety standards, the company was ushering in new practices, such as rotating shifts and deskilling of jobs as well as elimination of many safety procedures. In 1991, the company hired a new labor relations director who was known for promoting union busting practices. Workers with years and decades of experience at the plant were fired and new supervisors forced workers to ignore OSHA regulations. A new attendance policy was also instituted and workers were shocked to find out that anyone with over seven absences per year would be fired and the number of allowed absences would decrease every year. A few months later, company management announced a new set of offences that were grounds for immediate termination. This list included \\"smoking outside of designated areas; loafing; dishonesty; sleeping on duty; insubordination; refusal to work overtime as directed; unauthorized possession of a camera; and use of abusive or threatening language.\\" This was a gross violation of the union contract, which states that employers cannot fire employees without having the \\"just cause\\" to do so. Due to this new regulation, more workers were fired during the next year than had been fired in the previous twenty years combined. Considering the climate, it was no surprise that continued contract negotiations were unsuccessful. Under the guidance of Jerry Tucker, the union began to organize an in-plant \\"work to rule\\" campaign, where workers pressure management to reach a fair campaign by altering their behavior on the job, as opposed to going on strike. At A. E. Staley, this meant that the workers collectively decided to do only what they were told to do by their supervisor without their past knowledge and experiences. They performed only their outlined job duties and nothing extra. The goal of the work to rule campaign was to show management that the factory could not be run without the knowledge and skills of the workers. In many ways, A. E. Staley was the perfect environment for this type of labor tactic, as most unionized workers had acquired skills over the years that boosted overall production and quality of the product. Management and new supervisors simply did not have this knowledge and skills to effectively instruct workers. This was evidenced in the fact that over the next 11 months during which the work to rule campaign occurred, production fell drastically. A company spokesperson estimated that production had fallen by 32%, but union estimates were upwards of 50%. The New York Times reported that the decision resulting in the lockout of A. E. Staley union employees were due to Staley officials claiming that workers had been sabotaging plant operations for the weeks prior to the lockout. Representatives from the Allied Industrial Workers of America, claimed that there were no reports of any employees being reprimanded for sabotage, going back nine months since the lockout. The lockout would result in a two and half-year labor movement that would end in 1996. During that period, union workers fought to win back a fair contract, which would eliminate mandatory 12-hour shifts and mandatory overtime, and address safety concerns. The lockout turned into a national labor movement when union workers from two other Decatur-based companies, Caterpillar Inc. and Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, walked out on contract disputes in August 1994 and joined lockout workers from A. E. Staley in protests, picketing and public demonstrations. The A. E. Staley plants were operated at full capacity by the white collar works and the union ended up giving in to company demands. Chicago Bears football team In 1917, A. E. Staley's Fellowship Club formed a baseball team managed by future Baseball Hall of Famer Joe McGinnity. Gene Staley was a big sports fan, believing it helped build character and instill a sense of competition in his employees. Two years later, the Fellowship Club created a football counterpart. The players on both teams worked as semi- professionals in his factory. The football team, nicknamed the Decatur Staleys and headed by a coach named Brennan, competed on the independent circuit in 1919; after losing its first game, the team won six in a row to go 6‚Äì1. In March 1920, George Halas, a minor league baseball and college football player, was invited by A. E. Staley superintendent George Chamberlain to head the football team. Halas agreed on the conditions that he may sign and invite his former teammates to play and work for the company, which Chamberlain accepted. \\"I was elated\\", Halas wrote in his autobiography. \\"I saw the offer as an exciting opportunity but did not suspect the tremendous future Mr. Staley was opening for me.\\" Halas played for both the football and baseball teams in addition to working as a scale clerk. In the summer, he assisted in forming the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which would eventually become the National Football League. The Staleys went 10‚Äì1‚Äì2 in the 1920 season and lost out to the Akron Pros for the championship. Although much of the team's home games were played at Staley Field, the team struggled financially due to the stadium holding only 1,500 fans and not producing enough money from ticket sales. The situation was exacerbated by company employees receiving 50 percent discounts on their tickets. Halas elected to move a game against the Chicago Cardinals to Cubs Park in Chicago to alleviate monetary stress. Nevertheless, A. E. Staley's funding continued to drain, and the company ended the 1920 season having lost $14,406.36. In compensation, Gene Staley ordered the team to pay back the 2.5 hours of work that had been used to practice. Halas became A. E. Staley's athletic director in March 1921. When the depression of 1920‚Äì21 hit, Gene Staley convinced Halas to move the team to Chicago for the 1921 APFA season, and gave him $5,000 to fund the team and promote the company in exchange for keeping the name Staleys. Now known as the Chicago Staleys, the team won the championship with a 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 record. During the 1922 league meeting, debate flared over the Staleys' ownership status. Halas and partner Dutch Sternaman ran the team, but agent Bill Harley also sought to do the same. When the APFA contacted Staley, he responded the move to Chicago also included Halas inheriting full ownership of the team. In an 8‚Äì2 vote, league owners decided in favor of Halas/Sternaman. Halas later renamed the team to the Chicago Bears. Although he no longer owned the team, Staley regularly attended Bears games and nicknamed them the \\"Transplants\\". In October 1956, to celebrate A. E. Staley's 50-year anniversary, Halas organized a \\"Staley Day\\" for the Bears‚ÄìBaltimore Colts game at Wrigley Field. The Bears reserved 1,000 seats for company employees and allowed only them to purchase game tickets from September 3‚Äì10, while Wabash Railroad designated a special train from Dearborn Station to the stadium. Halas invited surviving Staley teammates to the game and an evening dinner, while Staley's son A. E. Staley Jr. and Decatur mayor Clarence A. Sablotny also attended the game. The Bears won 58‚Äì27, the most points scored by the Bears since 1940. Staley serves as the namesake of the Bears' mascot Staley Da Bear. Lake Decatur In 1922, Gene Staley proposed a project to the city of Decatur that would create Lake Decatur, which is Illinois‚Äô largest artificial body of water. Staley required the artificial lake in order to maintain his plant's necessity of 19 million gallons of water a day to sustain production. Staley threatened to the Decatur City Council, if the city refused to allow the construction of the artificial lake, that he would close his plant and move it to Peoria, Illinois. Decatur allowed the company to go forward with the project, and in 1922, the construction of the 2,800 arches and a 30-mile shoreline of the artificial lake started.

While it may signal an autism-spectrum disorder when it persists for an abnormal length of time, some degree of pronoun confusion can occur as a part of normal speech development, and it is common in toddlers. Pronoun reversal is closely linked to echolalia: referring to themselves as they have heard others speak of them, resulting in the misapplication of pronouns. For example: :Parent: What are you doing, Johnny? :Child: You're here. :Parent: Are you having a good time? :Child: You sure are. As with many other autistic traits, if speech continues to develop more normally, this pronoun reversal might be expected to disappear. However, it can also be highly resistant to change. Some children require extensive training to stop pronoun reversal, even after they have stopped echolalia.

He is popularly known as 'Babae Pop' which translates to \\"Founder of Pop\\" music in Pakistan. His style of singing is inspired by playback singer Ahmed Rushdi and Elvis Presley. Life and career Alamgir was born on 11 August 1955 in East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). His father Farmuzal Haq was a politician and a member of the All India Muslim League and later a member of Pakistan's National Assembly.He also studied in Mirzapur Cadet College, Tangail, in the province of East Bengal. He briefly studied at Shaheen School in Dhaka. At the age of around 15, he moved to Karachi, West Pakistan to continue his studies at the University of Karachi to finally immigrate to USA. He played the bass guitar for the Windy Side of Care, the first music band ever to be created in East Pakistan. Later in 1967, he became the lead vocal of the band. He settled in the PECHS area of Karachi and started singing in the evenings, around 1970, at a small caf√© called 'Globe Hotel' on Tariq Road, Karachi. He was promised Rupees 350 per month plus free dinner. The caf√© was famous for its intellectual gatherings and that is where his potential talent was spotted. Someone from the audience in the hotel liked his style of singing and playing the guitar. So that person told him about a programme on the Pakistan Television Corporation station called Ferozan where the program host Khushbakht Aliya was conducting a show for the youth. He gave his audition, Khushbakht liked his singing and the guitar playing but she had already selected someone else. It just so happened that renowned Pakistani music composer Sohail Rana, was also sitting in the same room who later asked someone to call Alamgir to his car outside the TV station. Sohail Rana said, he liked his (Alamgir's) guitar playing and asked if he would like to perform as a guitarist for his children's programme (hum hi hum). This is how Alamgir entered in the formal world of music. He started singing on the Pakistan Television Corporation TV channel at the beginning of the 1970s, when the people in Pakistan were not yet familiar with the modern Urdu pop music and when western music was generally considered as modern music in Pakistan. Shair Siddiqui hired him for the first pop musical program Sunday Ke Sunday, a TV series of Karachi Television in 1971/72 and introduced Alamgir with the song Albela Rahi. It proved to be a hit in 1972 among the youth of the 1970s. There was a time during the 1970s when the music loving boys and girls gathered regularly on the streets near the Karachi Jheel Park to get a glimpse of this new pop singer as he used to travel along in his red sedan in the evening. Alamgir's second pop song Pyar hai zindagi ka gehna was also an Urdu translation of a foreign song. He soon became popular among the younger generation in the country. Alamgir is also known for his many renditions of Bengali music. The most notable Bengali song he is known to sing is Aamay Bhashaili Rey. Alamgir quickly made his mark on the Pakistani music scene. He sang for the Pakistani television in the very beginning of his career, but later as the time passed, he started singing for the Pakistani music industry. He also performs abroad. Alamgir has inherited polycystic kidney disease (PKD) from his mother, undergoes kidney dialysis three times per week and requires a kidney transplant. He currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He is respected by the music lovers everywhere and still performs in live concerts in America. In 2012, Alamgir visited Pakistan and performed in various shows. He returned to Pakistan to make a comeback on the TV screen specially for his fans who grew up with him. In April 2013, Alamgir joined Meesha Shafi, Strings, Ali Azmat and Shahzad Hasan as a judge on the immensely popular singing talent show Music Icons which aired on ARY Digital TV channel. He gave a live interview at a morning show on PTV channel named \\"Subh-e-Nau\\" on 6 January 2014.

A sequel to The Monastery, its action takes place in 1567 and 1568. It reaches its climax in the escape of Mary, Queen of Scots from Lochleven Castle leading to her defeat at the Battle of Langside and her final departure from Scotland. Composition and sources It seems likely that Scott was considering a novel depicting the imprisonment of Mary Queen of Scots at Lochleven Castle as early as the summer of 1817. It is further likely that in August 1819 he began work on a novel (soon called The Monastery) which was intended to include the Lochleven material. He laid that aside to complete Ivanhoe, and by the time he resumed writing in November he realised he had sufficient material to make two three-volume novels. He completed The Monastery before the end of February 1820. The Abbot was begun in the second half of April and finished (with the possible exception of the Introductory Epistle) probably on 11 August.Walter Scott, The Abbot, ed. Christopher Johnson (Edinburgh, 2000), 379‚Äì86. Scott had in his library an extensive collection of works relating to Mary, Queen of Scots, the most recent being the Life of Mary, Queen of Scots by George Chalmers which appeared in 1818. It is noteworthy that he refuses to address the question of her role in the death of Darnley, which had long tended to dominate discussions. The characterisation of the other historical figures in the novel is essentially Scott's own, though again he was able to glean details of actions and utterances from his collection.Ibid., 467‚Äì68. Editions The Abbot was published by Archibald Constable and John Ballantyne in Edinburgh on 2 September 1820 and by Longman. Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown in London two days later.For a description of the early editions see Ibid., 384‚Äì86, 395‚Äì400. As with all of the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The print run was 10,000 and the price ¬£1 4s (¬£1.20). There is no reason to suppose that Scott was involved with the novel again until the beginning of 1830 when he revised the text and added an introduction and notes for the 'Magnum' edition where it appeared as Volumes 20 and 21 in January and February 1831. The standard modern edition, by Christopher Johnson, was published in 2000 as Volume 10 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels: it is based on the first edition with emendations mainly from the manuscript and a set of editorial changes to rectify the Douglas family relationships; the Magnum material is included in Volume 25b. Plot introduction It is concerned mainly with Queen Mary's imprisonment at Loch Leven Castle in 1567, her escape, and her defeat. Parallel to this is the romance of Roland Graeme, a dim-witted but spirited youth. He is brought up at the castle of Avenel by Mary Avenel and her husband, Halbert Glendinning. Roland is sent by the Regent Murray to be page to Mary Stuart with directions to guard her. He falls in love with Catherine Seyton, who is one of the ladies-in-waiting to the queen. He is found later to be the heir to Avenel. Edward Glendinning, the brother of Halbert, is the abbot of the title, the last abbot of the monastery described in the preceding novel. Plot summary Ten years had passed since the final events of The Monastery, during which Halbert had been knighted for his services to the regent, and Lady Avenel had adopted Roland, whom her dog had saved from drowning. The boy grew up petted by his mistress, but disliked by her chaplain and servants; and at length, having threatened to dirk the falconer, he was dismissed to seek his fortune. He had been secretly taught the Romish faith by Father Ambrose, and led by his grandmother to believe that he was of gentle birth. She now introduced him to Catherine Seyton, and then accompanied him to the abbey, where the revels of some masqueraders were interrupted by the arrival of Sir Halbert on his way to Edinburgh, who attached the youth to his train. On reaching the capital he aided Lord Seyton in a street fray, and was introduced to the Earl of Murray, who desired him to be ready to travel at short notice. In company with Adam Woodcock he adjourned to an inn, and was entrusted by Henry Seyton (whom he believed to be Catherine in male attire) with a sword, which he was not to unsheath until commanded by his rightful sovereign. He then learnt that he was to be attached to the household of Queen Mary, and accompanied Lord Lindesay to the castle of Lochleven, situated on an island, where he found Catherine in attendance on her, and was present when, in compliance with a note contained in his sword-sheath, she signed her abdication at the behest of the Secret Council. Loch Leven Castle After a lapse of several months, during which Henderson attempted to convert him, Roland learnt from Catherine that Father Ambrose had been evicted from his monastery, and he pledged himself, for her sake, to assist the imprisoned queen in recovering her freedom. A plan of escape arranged by George Douglas having failed through the vigilance of the Lady of Lochleven, Roland undertook to forge a false set of keys, and the abbot arrived disguised as a man-at-arms sent by Sir William to take part in guarding the castle. As soon as the curfew had tolled, a preconcerted signal was made from the shore, and Roland contrived to substitute his forged keys for the real ones. At midnight the garden gate was unlocked, a boat was in waiting, Henry Seyton came forward, and the queen, with all her adherents, was safely afloat, when the alarm was given. Roland, however, had run back, ere they started, to turn the locks on their jailers, and, until they were out of reach of musketry, George Douglas protected Mary by placing himself before her. On landing, horses were in readiness, and before daybreak they reached Lord Seyton's castle in West Lothian, which was strongly garrisoned. The next morning, as the queen was endeavouring to make peace between Roland and Henry Seyton, who treated the page as a churl, his grandmother emerged from a recess and declared him to be the son of Julian Avenel, who was killed in the battle with Sir John Foster; Lord Seyton also recognised him, and insisted that his son should shake hands with him. Supported by a considerable number of adherents in battle array, and accompanied by the abbot, the royal party moved onwards for Dumbarton, where help from France was expected. They were, however, intercepted by the regent's forces, and a desperate battle ensued. The queen stood near a yew tree, guarded by her devoted admirer George Douglas in close armour, while her page pushed forward to watch the conflict. It had lasted nearly an hour, when Sir Halbert attacked the flank of Mary's supporters, and they were completely routed, Henry Seyton was killed, and Douglas, who was mortally wounded, expired without withdrawing his eyes from her face. Hopeless of further aid, the queen adopted the fatal resolution of trusting to Elizabeth's mercy, and, having bid adieu to her followers, took ship for England. Roland soon afterwards succeeded in obtaining proofs of his claim as the heir of Avenel, and was married to Catherine on her return from two years residence with her unhappy mistress.

Volume One Ch.1: The stag-hound Wolf rescues a boy [Roland Gr√¶me] from the lake at Avenel, but both dog and the preacher Warden disapprove of the Lady's affection for the child. Ch. 2: Magdalen Gr√¶me, Roland's grandmother, who is under a compulsion not to remain long in one place, agrees that he should be brought up in the castle. Ch. 3: Returning to the castle after some months, Sir Halbert agrees that Roland should remain as the Lady's page. The boy's indulgent upbringing alienates Warden among others. Ch. 4: Roland's behaviour continues to cause concern. When Warden attacks him in a severe sermon at family worship he leaves the congregation. Ch. 5: Roland and the Lady have high words, and it is agreed he should quit the castle. Ch. 6: Lilias the handmaid and Wingate the steward welcome Roland's departure and suspect him of popish sympathies. Ch. 7: Roland meets his companion Ralph Fisher, who is unimpressed by his new situation. He is cheered up by Adam Woodcock the falconer, who lends him money. Ch. 8: Roland meets Magdalen at a ruined sanctuary, and she speaks with Catholic enthusiasm of his high destiny. Ch. 9: With some reluctance Roland promises Magdalen to be obedient to the Catholic cause, having been secretly instructed in the faith at Avenel by Fr Ambrose (Edward Glendinning). Ch. 10: Roland and Magdalen arrive at a community of religious sisters, where he is introduced to Catherine Seyton. Ch. 11: Roland and Catherine become acquainted. Ch. 12: Magdalen insists that Roland and Catherine embrace as companions in the cause, incurring the disapproval of Catherine's aunt, Mother Bridget. Preparations are made for leaving the community. Ch. 13: Magdalen and Roland travel to the now desolate monastery of Kennaquhair where Ambrose is being installed as abbot. Ch. 14: The mob of misrule enter the church and Roland stabs the Abbot of Unreason at their head. Ch. 15: The Abbot of Unreason turns out to be unhurt, and when Sir Halbert arrives and quells the disturbance he is revealed as Adam Woodcock. Roland agrees to join Sir Halbert's service. Volume Two Ch. 1 (16): Roland takes the road to Edinburgh, guided by Adam who indicates he is to enter the service of the Earl of Moray. Ch. 2 (17): In Edinburgh, Roland impulsively joins in an affray on behalf of the Seytons and is rewarded with a gold chain and medal by Lord Seyton. Ch. 3 (18): At Holyrood, Michael Wing-the-Wind fills Adam in on the political situation before conducting Roland to deliver a letter from Sir Halbert to Moray, who is impressed by his spirit. He overhears Moray and the Earl of Morton engaged in political bargaining. Ch. 4 (19): Roland and Adam go to St Michael's inn where a page, taken by Roland to be Catherine in disguise [in fact, her twin brother Henry], gives him a sword to be drawn only for his lawful sovereign, before striking Adam for singing an anti-papist song. Ch. 5 (20): Moray tells Roland he is to enter the service of Mary Queen of Scots and watch out for any suspicious activity. Roland travels to Lochleven with Lord Lindesay and Sir Robert Melville. Ch. 6 (21): Arriving at the island castle, the party is received by the Lady of Lochleven, who spars verbally with Mary. After some delay Mary tells Roland to admit Lindesay and Melville. Ch. 7 (22): Mary at first refuses to sign the abdication document now brought by Lord Ruthven, but the sheath of the sword given to Roland in Ch. 19 is found to contain a message from Lord Seyton advising her to agree. This is also Melville's advice, and the abdication accordingly takes place. Ch. 8 (23): Roland and Catherine share a meal with Lady Mary Fleming, after which Catherine denies that she was the St Michael's page. Ch. 9 (24): As time passes, Roland is increasingly influenced by Elias Henderson, the Protestant chaplain. George Douglas warns him against attempting to leave the castle and reveals by his manner that he is attracted by Catherine, who proceeds to re- dedicate Roland to the Catholic cause. Ch. 10 (25): Henderson works on Roland and he is given business to transact on shore. Ch. 11 (26): Roland is subject to the attentions of the chamberlain in Kinross, Dr Luke Lundin, and they encounter Mother Nicneven [Magdalen in disguise], whom Lundin dismisses with contempt. Volume Three Ch. 1 (27): A[n apparent] maiden, who Roland takes to be Catherine [in fact, Henry in disguise], is brought before Lundin for hitting a jester at a rustic theatrical performance.

A gardener [Boniface, formerly Abbot of Melrose in The Monastery] complains of his hard life. Ch. 3 (29): Back in the castle, after Mary and Lady Lochleven have sparred again Roland finds himself locked out in the garden and hears whispers. Ch. 4 (30): The whisperers are George Douglas and the St Michael's page, who indicates to Roland that he is not Catherine. Mary's attempt at escape is thwarted. She spars yet again with Lady Lochleven, who expresses her desire for revenge to her steward Dryfesdale. Roland rejects Dryfesdale's attempt to secure his allegiance. Ch. 5 (31): Roland and Catherine bond in common devotion to Mary. Mary, anxious for them, is provoked to an outburst of passion by a recollection of Darnley's murder, which Catherine then explains to Roland. Roland denies Dryfesdale entry to Mary's presence. Ch. 6 (32): Dryfesdale tells Lady Lochleven he has poisoned Mary with material from Mother Nicneven which he had intended to use on Roland in particular. Roland and Catherine make Lady Lochleven believe Mary has drunk the poison, but Magdalen arrives with Lundin and it becomes clear that this is not the case, and in any event the liquid was harmless. Ch. 7 (33): Resigned to his fate, Dryfesdale undertakes to deliver a message from Lady Lochleven to her son Moray advocating his death, but on the way he is stabbed by Henry Seyton: George Douglas arrives to witness his last moments. Ch. 8 (34): Randal announces Dryfesdale's death and Roland realises he has been confused by the close resemblance between Catherine and her brother. Plans are made for another attempt to free Mary, involving the forging of a duplicate set of keys. Ch. 9 (35): Abbot Ambrose arrives in disguise to participate in the successful escape. It becomes clear that the gardener at Kinross is the former abbot Boniface. Ch. 10 (36): George Douglas escorts Mary to Niddrie castle where she consults with her nobles. Magdalen reveals Roland's parentage, but Henry Seyton, taking him to be illegitimate, continues to reject his aspiration to Catherine's hand. Ch. 11 (37): Ambrose checks Roland's military enthusiasm with a realistic assessment. At the battle of Langside Mary's forces are defeated, and Henry Seyton and George Douglas both fall. Ch. 12 (38): At Dundrennan abbey, Ambrose and Roland encounter Boniface, still a gardener, who tells how Julian Avenel's marriage certificate had been taken from him by troopers under Sir Halbert. Mary leaves for England in spite of Ambrose's misgivings. Adam produces the certificate of the marriage performed by Father Phillip, and Roland is recognised as heir to Avenel. After two years he marries Catherine, in spite of his formal adoption of Protestantism. Reception Reviewers generally welcomed The Abbot as a return to form after The Monastery (the absence of the White Lady being particularly noted), and some even saw the novel as ranking with Waverley.For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews of The Abbot see William S.

Mary Queen of Scots attracted much praise, though often qualified by disappointment at her fondness for sarcasm. Catherine was found striking, but her twin brother confused the reader's view of her. In their different ways George Douglas and Adam Woodcock were judged admirable as moral touchstones. There was criticism of Roland's instability, and his grandmother Magdalen came over as a clumsy over-used type. The conduct of the narrative divided reviewers: some found it loose, others well controlled. The scenes in Edinburgh and the escape from Lochleven were highlighted as particularly effective. Several reviewers commented favourably on the depiction of monastic life and on the even-handed treatment of the religious divide.

It was produced by Hammer Film Productions. It is based on the 1872 Sheridan Le Fanu novella Carmilla and is the first film in the Karnstein Trilogy, the other two films being Lust for a Vampire (1971) and Twins of Evil (1971). The three films were somewhat daring for the time in explicitly depicting lesbian themes.  Plot  In early 19th century Styria, a beautiful blonde (Kirsten Lindholm) in a diaphanous gown materializes from a misty graveyard. Encountering the Baron Hartog (Douglas Wilmer), a vampire hunter out to avenge the death of his sister, the girl is identified as a vampire and decapitated. Many years later, a dark-haired lady leaves her daughter Marcilla (Ingrid Pitt) in the care of General Spielsdorf (Peter Cushing) and his family in Styria. Marcilla quickly befriends the General's niece, Laura (Pippa Steel). Laura subsequently suffers nightmares that she is being attacked, and dies of a gradual sickness; whereupon Marcilla departs. Faking a carriage break-down, Marcilla's mother leaves her (now using the alias 'Carmilla') at the residence of a Mr. Morton, where Carmilla befriends and seduces Morton's daughter Emma (Madeline Smith). Thereafter Emma suffers nightmares of penetration on her heart, and her breasts shows tiny wounds. Emma's governess, Mademoiselle Perrodot (Kate O'Mara), becomes Carmilla's accomplice. The butler and a doctor suspect them; but Carmilla kills each one. A mysterious man in black watches events from a distance, smiling (his presence is never explained). Having killed the butler, Carmilla takes Emma prisoner and departs. When Mademoiselle Perrodot begs Carmilla to take her too, Carmilla kills her. Emma is rescued by a young man named Carl (Jon Finch), and Carmilla flees to her ancestral castle, now a ruin. All this coincides with the arrival of the General, who brings a now-aged Baron Hartog. They find Carmilla's grave, which reveals that her true name is Mircalla Karnstien, where the General forces a stake into Carmilla's heart, and cuts off her head. Thereupon Carmilla's portrait on the wall shows a fanged skeleton instead of a beautiful young woman. Cast * Ingrid Pitt as Marcilla/Carmilla/Countess Mircalla Karnstein * Peter Cushing as General Spielsdorf * George Cole as Roger Morton * Kate O'Mara as Mademoiselle Perrodot (the governess) * Dawn Addams as the Countess * Madeline Smith as Emma Morton * Douglas Wilmer as Baron Joachim von Hartog * Jon Finch as Carl Ebhardt * Ferdy Mayne as doctor * Pippa Steel as Laura * Kirsten Lindholm as first vampire * John Forbes-Robertson as man in black * Shelagh Wilcocks as housekeeper * Janet Key as Gretchin * Harvey Hall as Renton * Charles Farrell as landlord  Production  The film was a co-production between Hammer and American International, who were interested in a vampire movie with more explicit sexual content to take advantage of a more relaxed censorship environment. It was decided to adapt Carmilla.The Flesh and the Fury: X-posing Twins of Evil (2012) documentary Harry Fine and Michael Style were the two producers. Before production, the script of The Vampire Lovers was sent to the chief censor John Trevelyan, who warned the studio about depictions of lesbianism, pointing out that a previous lesbian film, The Killing of Sister George, had had five minutes excised by his office. In response, Hammer replied that the lesbianism was not of their doing, but was present in the original story by Le Fanu. Trevelyan backed down as a result. Production of The Vampire Lovers began at Elstree Studios on 19 January 1970 and used locations in the grounds of Moor Park Mansion, Hertfordshire (standing in for Styria, Central Europe). Produced on a relatively low budget of ¬£165,227, it was the final Hammer film to be financed with American money‚Äîmost of the later films were backed by Rank or EMI. While filming the scene in which Carmilla attacks Madame Perrodot, Ingrid Pitt's fangs kept falling out of her mouth and dropping into Kate O'Mara's cleavage, prompting gales of uncontrollable laughter from both actresses. Finally, Pitt grabbed some chewing gum from the mouth of one of the crew members and used it to secure her fangs.  Critical reception  The Vampire Lovers has received mixed reception from critics. Variety's review of the film was mixed, claiming the story was not great and it had \\"fairly flat dialog,\\" but the script had \\"all the needed ingredients.\\" A. H. Weiler of The New York Times called it \\"a departure from the hackneyed bloody norm... professionally directed, opulently staged and sexy to boot.\\"Adam Bernstein, \\"Roy Ward Baker, 93,\\" The Washington Post, 7 October 2010, URL accessed 11 March 2014. The Monthly Film Bulletin declared, \\"Rather below par, even by recent Hammer standards, this involves the customary heavy breathing, lusty fangs and tolerably luxurious sets, with the innovation of an exposed nipple or two to support the lesbian angle.\\" Dave Kehr wrote a favourable retrospective review for Chicago Reader, writing that the film \\"resulted from the last significant surge of creative energy at Britain's Hammer Films, which thereafter descended into abject self-parody.\\" Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a passing grade of two-and-a-half stars, calling it a \\"rather erotic Hammer chiller\\".Leonard Maltin, ed., Leonard Maltin's 2002 Movie & Video Guide. A Signet Book, 2001, p. 1478. Allmovie wrote, \\"This Hammer Films production isn't their finest moment but its easy to understand why it has become an enduring cult favorite with horror fans: The Vampire Lovers pushes the \\"bloodshed & bosoms\\" formula of the Hammer hits to its limit\\". On review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 56%, based on nine reviews, and is certified \\"rotten\\". Home media The Vampire Lovers was released on 26 August 2003 on DVD by MGM Home Video (Fox Video) as a double-sided Midnite Movies Double Feature DVD consisting of both The Vampire Lovers and Countess Dracula (1971). Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray on 30 April 2013.

It is topped with a roof or cap that rotates to bring the sails into the wind. This type of windmill got its name from its resemblance to smocks worn by farmers in an earlier period. Construction Smock mills differ from tower mills, which are usually cylindrical rather than hexagonal or octagonal, and built from brick or stone masonry instead of timber. The majority of smock mills are octagonal in plan, with a lesser number hexagonal in plan, such as Killick's Mill, Meopham. A very small number of smock mills were decagonal or dodecagonal in plan, an example of the latter being at Wicken, Cambridgeshire. Distribution Smock mills exist in Europe and particularly in England, where they were common, particularly in the county of Kent, where the tallest surviving smock mill in the United Kingdom, Union Mill, can be found at Cranbrook. They reached their heyday in the earlier part of the 19th century, after which the advent of steam power started the decline of the windmill. =Britain= Designed by the civil engineer John Smeaton, Chimney Mill in Spital Tongues, Newcastle upon Tyne was the first five-sailed smock mill in Britain. It was built in 1782 and is the only surviving smock mill in the North East region. However, the sails and original cap are no longer in place. The oldest surviving smock mill in England (dated to 1650) is located in Lacey Green, Buckinghamshire. The hexagonal mill has been restored by the Chiltern Society. =Ireland= St Patrick's Tower in Dublin is believed to have once been the largest smock windmill in Europe. =Massachusetts= The Old Mill on Nantucket Island There is an operating smock mill on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. Built in 1746 by Nathan Wilbur, a Nantucket sailor who had spent time in Holland, the \\"Old Mill\\" is the oldest functioning mill in the United States. It is the only surviving mill of the four smock mills that once stood on Popsquachet (\\"windy hill\\" in the Wampanoag language) overlooking Nantucket town. Until late in the 19th century, there was a fifth Nantucket mill called \\"Round-Top Mill\\" on the site of the present New North Cemetery. The Old Mill was in deplorable condition when it was sold for twenty dollars in 1828 to Jared Gardner for use as \\"firewood.\\" Instead of dismantling it, Gardner, a carpenter by trade, restored the mill to working condition making it capable once again of grinding corn. The mill was sold again in 1866 to John Francis Sylvia, a Portuguese miller of Azorean descent, who operated it for many years with his assistant Peter Hoy until it fell into disuse in 1892. In 1897, Miss Caroline French purchased the mill at an auction for $850 and donated it to the Nantucket Historical Association (NHA). The NHA restored it in 1937 and continues to maintain it, grind corn and guide tours of the mill during the summer and early autumn.

Cancer Stem Cell Unit at ISBReMIT  This unit of Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza is developing selective biopharmaceuticals. It is working in collaboration with two innovative startups StemGen, Italy and HyperStem SA, Switzerland to revolutionize technology of cancer stem cells in experimentation on patients. = Medical Genetics Unit = Major activities of this research unit include- discovery of disease related genes, study of genomic signatures in disease pathology, analysis of deregulated pathyways in complex pathologies and functional studies of mutations in genes associated with tumour and other complex diseases. Dr. Giuseppe Merla, a scientist from IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Medical Genetics Unit led the discovery of a novel rare genetic syndrome- IDDCA (intellectual development disorder with cardiac arrhythmia) along with collaborators from America, the Netherlands, Brazil and Switzerland. In 2018, Oxford BioDynamics had signed a deal with Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza to develop a novel biomarker assay for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). = Oncology Research Unit = Research interest of this unit is divided into three major areas-Epigenetic study of tumour development, molecular basis of chemoresistance in solid tumours, miRNA expression profiling in colorectal cancer, breast cancer and gliomas. The aim of this unit is to study identification of early markers by non-invasive analysis, characterization of cancer stem cells, and develop customized molecular therapies. In 2018, as a member of the network Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza completed RESORT trial Phase II (A Randomized, Open Label, Multicenter Phase 2 Study, to Evaluate the Efficacy of Sorafenib in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma After a Radical Resection of the Metastases). IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza has been recognized as one of the 20 highly specialized centres for diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer based on studying genetic and molecular detail using microchip technology. = Mendel Institute of Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza (CSS Mendel Institute) = Mission of this institute is to study and prevent rare diseases. Three major activities of this institute include-research, diagnosis and clinical consultancy. The institute has five major research units-Molecular Diagnostics Unit, Bioinformatics Unit, Cytogenetic Diagnostics Unit, Diabetes Research Unit, and iPS cellular programming research Unit. = Diabetology and Endocrinology Research Unit = This unit focuses its interest on epidemiological and genetic bases of type 2 diabetes and its cardio-nephro- vascular complications. It has carried out research on identification/characterization of some important genes like ENPP1, ADIPOQ, TRIB3, RETN, IRS1 and PPARgamma2 and also insulin signaling inhibitors such as ENPP1. = Hepatology Research Unit = Hepatology unit works on two thematic areas-responses to anti-viral therapy in hepatitis and genetics of hepatopathic patients. In 2009, the unit identified a novel marker of response to the anti-viral therapy of hepatitis C in collaboration with Duke University and North Carolina. The study led to discovery of variants of IL28B gene which is now widely used for prediction of response to the therapy. The unit has a long history performing clinically relevant research in Hepatology since the 1990s. Gilead Sciences, one of the world's largest biotech companies maintains strong collaboration with Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza for research on HCV treatment. At the International Live Congress (ILC) 2019, Alessandra Mangia, MD, Chief of Liver Unit at IRCCS-Ospedale Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza presented the data on role of Gilead HCV Medicines to reach the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating HCV globally by 2030. = Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Research Unit = This unit deals with the large scale clinical and genomic data.

Psusennes is the Greek version of his original name Pasibkhanu or Pasebakhaenniut (in reconstructed Late Egyptian: /p…ôsiw Ée ï…ônneÀê î…ô/), which means \\"The Star Appearing in the City\\" while his throne name, Akheperre Setepenamun, translates as \\"Great are the Manifestations of Ra, chosen of Amun.\\"Peter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames & Hudson Ltd, 1994., p.178 He was the son of Pinedjem I and Henuttawy, Ramesses XI's daughter by Tentamun. He married his sister Mutnedjmet. Reign Psusennes I's precise reign length is unknown because different copies of Manetho's records credit him with a reign of either 41 or 46 years. Some Egyptologists have proposed raising the 41 year figure by a decade to 51 years to more closely match certain anonymous Year 48 and Year 49 dates in Upper Egypt. However, the German Egyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln has suggested that all these dates should be attributed to the serving High Priest of Amun, Menkheperre instead who is explicitly documented in a Year 48 record.Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \\"Das Ende des Neuen Reiches\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr √§gyptische Sprache, 119 (1992), p.26 Jansen-Winkeln notes that \\"in the first half of Dyn. 21, [the] HP Herihor, Pinedjem I and Menkheperre have royal attributes and [royal] titles to differing extents\\" whereas the first three Tanite kings (Smendes, Amenemnisu and Psusennes I) are almost never referred to by name in Upper Egypt with the exception of one graffito and rock stela for Smendes.Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \\"Dynasty 21\\" in Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss, and David Warburton (editors), Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: 2006, pp. 226-227, 229 In contrast, the name of Psusennes I's Twenty-first Dynasty successors such as Amenemope, Osorkon the Elder, and Siamun appear frequently in various documents from Upper Egypt while the Theban High Priest Pinedjem II who was a contemporary of the latter three kings never adopted any royal attributes or titles in his career.Hornung, Krauss & Warburton, p. 229 Hence, two separate Year 49 dates from Thebes and Kom OmboKenneth Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100-650 BC), third edition (Aris & Philips, 1996), pp. 421, 573 could be attributed to the ruling High Priest Menkheperre in Thebes instead of Psusennes I but this remains uncertain. Psusennes I's reign has been estimated at 46 years by the editors of the Handbook to Ancient Egyptian Chronology.Hornung, Krauss & Warburton, p. 493 Psusennes I must have enjoyed cordial relations with the serving High Priests of Amun in Thebes during his long reign since the High Priest Smendes II donated several grave goods to this king which were found in Psusennes II's tomb. During his long reign, Psusennes built the enclosure walls and the central part of the Great Temple at Tanis which was dedicated to the triad of Amun, Mut and Khonsu.Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, (Oxford: Blackwell Books, 1992), pp. 315-317 Psusennes was ostensibly the ruler responsible for turning Tanis into a fully-fledged capital city, surrounding its temple with a formidable brick temenos wall with its sanctuary dedicated to Amun being composed of blocks salvaged from the derelict Pi-Ramesses. Many of these blocks were unaltered and kept the name of Pi-Ramesses' builder, Ramesses II, including obelisks still bearing the name of Ramesses II transported from the former capital of Pi-Ramesses to Tanis. Psusennes had taken his sister, Mutnedjmet, in marriage, in addition to the Lady Wiay. Only two of Psusennes I's children remain identifiable.

In contrast to KV62, Psusennes I's tomb holds the distinction of being the only pharaonic grave ever found unscathed by any tomb robbing attempts. The tomb of Tutankhamun had been robbed twice in antiquity. In spite of the destruction of wooden artifacts within the tomb due to the moist Nile delta area, the king's magnificent funerary mask was recovered intact; it proved to be made of gold and lapis lazuli and held inlays of black and white glass for the eyes and eyebrows of the object.Lorna Oakes, Pyramids, Temples and Tombs of Ancient Egypt, Hermes House, 2003. p.216 Psusennes I's mask is considered to be \\"one of the masterpieces of the treasure[s] of Tanis\\" and is currently housed in Room 2 of the Cairo Museum.Alessandro Bongioanni & Maria Croce (ed.), The Treasures of Ancient Egypt: From the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Universe Publishing, a division of Ruzzoli Publications Inc., 2003. p.422 It has a maximum width and height of 38 cm and 48 cm respectively.Bongioanni & Croce, p.422 The pharaoh's \\"fingers and toes had been encased in gold stalls, and he was buried with gold sandals on his feet. The finger stalls are the most elaborate ever found, with sculpted fingernails. Each finger wore an elaborate ring of gold and lapis lazuli or some other semiprecious stone.\\"Brier, pp.146-147 Psusennes I's outer and middle sarcophagi had been recycled from previous burials in the Valley of the Kings through the state-sanctioned tomb robbing that was common practice in the Third Intermediate Period. A cartouche on the red outer sarcophagus shows that it had originally been made for Pharaoh Merenptah, the 19th Dynasty successor of Ramesses II. Psusennes I, himself, was interred in an \\"inner silver coffin\\" which was inlaid with gold.Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A complete Guide to Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson 1987. p.123 Since \\"silver was considerably rarer in Egypt than gold,\\" Psusennes I's silver \\"coffin represents a sumptuous burial of great wealth during Egypt's declining years.\\"Hobson, p.123 Dr. Douglass Derry, who worked as the head of Cairo University's Anatomy Department, examined the king's remains in 1940 and determined that the king was an old man when he died.Douglass E. Derry, Annales du Service des Antiquit√©s de l'√âgypte\\" Vol. 40 (1940), pp.969-970 Derry noted that Psusennes I's teeth were badly worn and full of cavities, that he had an abscess that left a hole in his palate, and observed that the king suffered from extensive arthritis and was probably crippled by this condition in his final years.Brier, p.147 References Further reading *Bob Brier, Egyptian Mummies: Unraveling the Secrets of an Ancient Art, William Morrow & Co, (1994), pp. 146‚Äì147. *Ad Thijs, The Burial of Psusennes I and ‚ÄúThe Bad Times‚Äù of P.

It is situated within the unitary authority of North Somerset on the southern side of the Gordano Valley, immediately adjacent to the M5 motorway. The parish has a population of 348. There is a village football club, Clapton in Gordano FC. They currently run two sides with a view to continue progressing throughout the leagues. Their home ground is currently Clapton Lane, Portishead. History The Black Horse Inn. The name Gordano comes from Old English and is descriptive of the triangular shape of the whole valley from Clevedon to Portishead, being the ablative singular of the Latinised form of Gorden meaning muddy valley. Roman coin hoards have been discovered in Clapton. The first discovery was in 1891 when 35 'third bras' coins were found at the top of Tickenham Hill. The second hoard of about 3500 bronze coins was discovered between 1922 and 1924 in a field between the church and the rectory. Some of the coins are in the Museum of Somerset while the majority were sold to the Nicholson Museum in Australia in 1949. The parish of Clapton was part of the Portbury Hundred. Coal was mined in the area in the 17th and 18th centuries. Half a mile west of the village is a manor house (now a farm). Another notable historic building in the village is The Black Horse pub, a 17th-century inn and former magistrate's gaol. Sperrings Farm with its 500-year-old listed farmhouse is situated on the outskirts of the village. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as playgrounds and dog fouling, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District. The village falls in 'Gordano' electoral ward. The ward stretches from the east side of Portishead through Clapton in Gordano to Tickenham. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 4,315. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography Near the village is Clapton Moor, 40 hectares of grassland owned and managed by the Avon Wildlife Trust. Religious sites The 13th century church is dedicated to St Michael. Landmarks Clapton court was a mansion house and then a farmhouse. The northern elevation dates from the 15th century with the rest of the building dating from the 17th and 19th centuries. It has been designated as a Grade II listed building. In 2009 planning permission was gained to demolish some of the farm buildings and convert others into holiday homes and offices.

History =Early years in Hot Springs= KAAY first signed on as KTHS on December 20, 1924, in Hot Springs, Arkansas.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 24 It operated on 600, 780, 800 and 1040 kilocycles at different times in its early days. By the 1930s, it moved to its current dial position at 1090 kHz, and was powered at 10,000 watts in the daytime, allowing it to be easily heard in the larger capital city of Little Rock, about 50 miles to the northeast. KTHS was an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network, continuing with the affiliation when the network was renamed ABC in 1945. KTHS was the founding station for the Lum and Abner Show in 1932. =Move to Little Rock= In 1953, KTHS got a big boost in power, going to its current 50,000 watts, and it also switched its city of license to Little Rock. It became an affiliate of the CBS Radio Network.Broadcasting Yearbook 1953 page 76 Two years later, it signed on Channel 11 KTHV which affiliated with the CBS Television Network. In 1962, the TV station and radio station were sold to separate owners, with KTHS bought by LIN Broadcasting. =Top 40 era= The new owners turned it into a top 40 station in 1962, switching the call sign to KAAY. In the 1960s, KAAY had plans to put a co-owned FM station on the air at 98.5 MHz, but due to the limited number of FM radios in those days, the project didn't get off the ground. KAAY was sold to Multimedia Radio in 1975, and the following year, Multimedia bought an FM station at 94.1 (now KKPT). The FM station aired beautiful music as KEZQ.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-13 During the station's heyday, KAAY featured a full-service Top-40 format, and was the dominant contemporary station for most of the state of Arkansas. During the 1960s and 1970s, on-air personalities included Mike McCormick, Doc Holiday, Jonnie King, Buddy Karr, Ken Knight, Sonny Martin, newscasters George J. Jennings, Wayne Moss, Phil North and Ray Lincoln of the Ray and Ram Program. The station also broadcast University of Arkansas football games. KAAY's cult status was forged in the late 1960s, when, after 11pm, the station abandoned the standard Top 40 format for three hours of underground music with the program Beaker Street hosted by Clyde Clifford. Its nighttime signal extended well beyond Little Rock and Arkansas, covering much of the Great Plains, North Central, and Mississippi Valley regions of the United States, leading to its nickname \\"The Mighty Ten Ninety.\\" Owing to its 50,000 watt clear channel signal that could be received in Cuba, KAAY provided residents of the island nation an important cultural link to the outside world in the years following the Cuban Revolution. During the 1962 Bay of Pigs Invasion, the United States government used the station to broadcast anti- Castro propaganda while working to win the release of Cuban exiles who participated in the failed exercise. KAAY was an inspiration to Cuban rock musicians and rock fans who tuned into Beaker Street late at night, keeping themselves informed about American music and underground music in the 1970s. They listened undercover with Soviet-made transistor radios. In the late 1960s the jingle started out with roaring thunder followed by a deep voice... \\"FIFTY THOUSAND WATTS OF MUSIC POWER K>>DOUBLE-A Y, LITTLE ROCK.\\" =Switch to religion= By 1980, listening to contemporary hits was shifting from AM to FM. The station tried moving to adult contemporary music and some country music. Eventually the station switched to an oldies sound, calling itself \\"Oldies 1090.\\" At night, when the station's 50,000-watt signal could be heard over a large territory, the station aired nine hours of paid religious programming. In April 1985, KAAY was sold to the Beasley Broadcasting Group, which switched to a format of Southern Gospel music and brokered religion. (The FM station was sold to Signal Media, which owned KLRA.) In 1998, KAAY was bought by Citadel Broadcasting for $5 million.Broadcasting Yearbook 2005 page D-62 In 2011, Citadel Broadcasting merged with Cumulus Media, which continued the religious format on KAAY. Cumulus Media owns scores of radio stations across the country, but KAAY is its only religious outlet. =Transmitter vandalism= KAAY's noted transmission facilities in Wrightsville have been vandalized several times. Copper thieves stole a large amount of transmission line, degrading the stations signal significantly. Roof damage allowed water to enter the MW-5 5,000-watt transmitter, knocking it off the air with a shorted High Voltage power transformer. Harris wanted way too much for a new transformer. I believe it was $19,000. We ended up getting a Collins 5,000 watt transmitter from our sister station in Dallas I believe. We couldn't run the MW-50A we only had 7/8 coax that we purchased to get something on the air. In 2015 I believe, we purchased 3 1/8 inch transmission line and buried it 4 feet underground to deter thieves and put the MW-50 back on at 50,000 watts day and 10,000 watts night. In 2017 we purchased a new Nautel NX-50 transmitter, new coax cable and a new phasor to connect the end towers. Mike Patton was contracted to install and tune the phasor. In June 2017 I was tasked to remove the old RCA transmitter to make room for the phasor and the NX50. I left the company in September 2017 to move to Las Vegas to be closer to my family. In December 2017, there was a major shake up in the engineering department and I was asked to go back to Little Rock to finish the project. The new Nautel Transmitter and the phasor was installed in January and February 2018 and KAAY was back to 50,000 watts day and 50,000 watts directional at night in late February 2018. This was edited by Daniel Appellof. I was the assistant Chief Engineer for KAAY Citadel/Cumulus Media Little Rock from July 2006 to September 2017. =KAAY Rewound= On Labor Day weekend of 2003, the station returned to its roots with a historical segment called \\"KAAY Rewound\\". KAAY's Barry Mac and sister station KARN's Grant Merrill played 1960s and '70s hits and took calls from all over the South. Clyde Clifford returned to talk about \\"Beaker Street\\". The station at various times broadcasts a feature called \\"Radio Yesterday\\" which includes the memories of the station's Top 40 heyday.

Important influences on the depiction of the Ripper include Marie Belloc Lowndes' 1913 novel The Lodger, which has been adapted for the stage and film, and Stephen Knight's 1976 work Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, which expanded on a conspiracy theory involving freemasons and royalty. The literature of the late Victorian era, including Arthur Conan Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes stories and Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, has provided inspiration for story-makers who have fused these fictional worlds with the Ripper. The Ripper makes appearances throughout the science fiction and horror genres and is internationally recognised as an evil character. The association of the Ripper with death and sex is particularly appealing to heavy metal and rock musicians, who have incorporated the Ripper murders into their work. Literature Title page of The Curse Upon Mitre Square, 1888 Works of fiction inspired by the Whitechapel murders arose immediately after the atrocities were committed. The short gothic novel The Curse Upon Mitre Square by John Francis Brewer, which features the murder of Catherine Eddowes in Mitre Square as a key plot element, was published in October 1888.Woods and Baddeley, pp. 61‚Äì62 Among works by other authors, In Darkest London by Margaret Harkness, who used the pseudonym John Law, was published in 1889. Harkness depicts the Ripper as a non-Jewish slaughterman who hides among the Jews in the East End of London.Meikle, p. 40 Ripper stories appealed to an international audience. A \\"reputedly unsavoury\\" anthology of short stories in Swedish, Uppsk√§raren (\\"The Ripper\\") by Adolf Paul, was published in 1892, but it was suppressed by Russian authorities.Woods and Baddeley, p. 67 The character of Sherlock Holmes has been used often in Jack the Ripper fiction. In 1907 Aus den Geheimakten des Welt-Detektivs No. 18 from German publisher Verlagshaus f√ºr Volksliteratur und Kunst featured \\"Wie Jack, der Aufschlitzer, gefasst wurde\\" (How Jack the Ripper Was Taken), in which Holmes captures the Ripper. In the 1930s the story was translated into Spanish in for Sherlock Holmes Memorias intimas del rey de los detectives No. 3, \\"El Destripador\\" (The Ripper), recently reprinted in a new book and translated into English for the first time.Sherlock Holmes Versus Jack the Ripper by Joseph A. Lovece, Createspace, 2014 Cullen called the story \\"amusing Sherlock Holmes pastiche\\". Holmes was also used later in Michael Dibdin's The Last Sherlock Holmes Story (1978), Ellery Queen's A Study in Terror (1966), John Sladek's Black Aura (1974), and Barrie Roberts' Sherlock Holmes and the Royal Flush (1998) amongst others.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 135 The first influential short story, \\"The Lodger\\" by Marie Belloc Lowndes, was published in McClure's Magazine in 1911 and novelised in 1913. It features a London couple, Mr and Mrs Bunting, who suspect that their lodger, Mr Sleuth, is a mysterious killer known as \\"The Avenger\\", clearly based on the Ripper.Meikle, pp. 44‚Äì48 Whether Sleuth really is \\"The Avenger\\" is left open: the focus of the story is on the Buntings' psychological terror, which may be entirely unfounded, rather than the actions of \\"The Avenger\\". In 1927, \\"The Lodger\\" was the subject of an Alfred Hitchcock-directed film: The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog, and four other adaptations were filmed in later years. In 1926, Leonard Matters proposed in a magazine article that the Ripper was an eminent doctor, whose son had died from syphilis caught from a prostitute. According to Matters, the doctor, given the pseudonym \\"Dr Stanley\\", committed the murders in revenge and then fled to Argentina. He expanded his ideas into a book, The Mystery of Jack the Ripper, in 1929. The book was marketed as a serious study, but it contains obvious factual errors and the documents it supposedly uses as references have never been found.Woods and Baddeley, pp. 114‚Äì115 It inspired other works such as the theatre play Murder Most Foul and the film Jack the Ripper.Woods and Baddeley, pp. 160, 198 Jonathan Goodman's 1984 book Who He? is also written as if it is a factual study, but the suspect described, \\"Peter J Harpick\\", is an invention whose name is an anagram of Jack the Ripper.Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 12‚Äì13 Robert Bloch's short story \\"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\\" (published in Weird Tales in 1943) cast the Ripper as an eternal who must make human sacrifices to extend his immortality.Meikle, p. 110 It was adapted for both radio (in Stay Tuned for Terror) and television (as an episode of Thriller in 1961 written by Barr√© Lyndon).Woods and Baddeley, p. 68 The science-fiction anthology Dangerous Visions (1967) featured an unrelated Ripper story by Bloch, \\"A Toy for Juliette\\", and a sequel by Harlan Ellison, \\"The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World\\", written with Bloch's permission. Bloch's work also includes The Will to Kill (1954) and Night of the Ripper (1984).Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 133, 135‚Äì136 The many novels influenced by the Ripper include:Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 133‚Äì136 *A Case to Answer (1947) by Edgar Lustgarten *The Screaming Mimi (1949) by Fredric Brown *Terror Over London (1957) by Gardner Fox *Ritual in the Dark (1960) and The Killer (1970) by Colin Wilson *Sagittarius (1962) by Ray Russell *A Feast Unknown (1969) by Philip Jos√© Farmer *A Kind of Madness (1972) by Anthony Boucher *Nine Bucks Row (1973) by T. E. Huff *The Michaelmas Girls (1975) by John Brooks Barry *Jack's Little Friend (1975) by Ramsey Campbell *By Flower and Dean Street (1976) by Patrice Chaplin *The Private Life of Jack the Ripper (1980) by Richard Gordon *Hasfelmetsz≈ë Jack (1981) by Gyula Hern√°di *White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings (1987) by Iain Sinclair *The Women of Whitechapel and Jack the Ripper (1991) by Paul West *Beasts in Velvet (1991) by Jack Yeovil *Anno Dracula (1992) by Kim Newman *A Night in the Lonesome October (1993) by Roger Zelazny *Ladykiller (1993) by Martina Cole *Savage (1993) by Richard Laymon *The Pit (1993) by Neil Penswick *Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem (1994) by Peter Ackroyd *Pentecost Alley (1996) by Anne Perry *Matrix (1998) by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry *The Name of the Star (2011) by Maureen Johnson * The Cutthroat (2017) by Clive Cussler and Justin Scott Theatre, opera and music theatre The Ripper features at the end of Frank Wedekind's morality play Die B√ºchse der Pandora (1904), in which the Ripper murders Lulu, the central character. Lulu is the personification of sinful Lust who meets her comeuppance when she unwittingly flirts with the Ripper.Meikle, p. 34 In the original stage production, Wedekind played the part of the Ripper.Cullen, p. 246 The play was later adapted into the film Pandora's Box (1928, directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst), and the opera Lulu (by Alban Berg), both of which also end with the murder of Lulu by the Ripper.Woods and Baddeley, p. 165 It was also made into three films in 1923, 1962 and 1980 respectively,Cullen, p. 246; Meikle, pp. 212‚Äì226 and a play Lulu by Peter Barnes premi√®red in 1970.Rumbelow, p. 286 Andr√© de Lorde's Jack l'Eventreur was part of the Grand Guignol's output in Paris. Marie Belloc Lowndes' novel and short story The Lodger was adapted for the stage as The Lodger: Who Is He? by Horace Annesley Vachell. In 1917, Lionel Atwill's first role in Broadway theatre was as the title character.Meikle, p. 49 Phyllis Tate also based her opera The Lodger, first performed in 1960, on Lowndes' story.Cullen, p. 248 Murder Most Foul by Claude Pirkis was first performed in 1948. The character of the murderer, Dr. Stanley, was taken from The Mystery of Jack the Ripper by Leonard Matters, first published in 1929.Woods and Baddeley, pp. 159‚Äì160 Doug Lucie's Force and Hypocrisy is based on the royal conspiracy theory of Stephen Knight.Rumbelow, p. 292 Two British musicals, Ripper by Terence Greer and The Jack the Ripper Show and How They Wrote It by Frank Hatherley, were staged in 1973.Wilson and Odell, pp. 310‚Äì311 Jack the Ripper: The Musical (1974), with lyrics and music by Ron Pember, who co-authored the book with Dennis de Marne,Ron Pember & Denis de Marne, Jack The Ripper: A Musical Play (Samuel French Ltd., 1976) influenced Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.Woods and Baddeley, pp. 75‚Äì76 In 1996, a rock opera entitled Yours Truly: Jack the Ripper with lyrics by Frogg Moody and Dave Taylor was performed and, in a break from recent practice, portrayed the Ripper as an ordinary everyday man.Woods and Baddeley, pp. 77 Film Marie Belloc Lowndes' book The Lodger has been made into five films: Alfred Hitchcock's The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), The Lodger (1932), The Lodger (1944), Man in the Attic (1953) and The Lodger (2009). Hitchcock decided to cast romantic lead Ivor Novello as the title character in his version of The Lodger, with the consequence that the film company, Gainsborough Pictures, insisted on a re-write to make Novello's character more sympathetic.Meikle, p. 50 In a change from the original story, whether the lodger is the killer is no longer left ambivalent at the end. Instead, the lodger's strange behaviour arises because he is a vigilante, trying to catch the real killer.Meikle, pp. 50‚Äì51 Novello remade the film in 1932 with a more dramatic ending, in which he throttles the killer, who is his demented brother, the \\"Bosnian Murderer\\".Meikle, pp. 53‚Äì54 Novello played both roles, and Maurice Elvey directed. It was released in an abridged version as The Phantom Fiend in 1935.Meikle, p. 55 The 1944 version dispensed with the ambivalence of the novel and instead casts the lodger, \\"Slade\\" played by Laird Cregar, as the villain \\"Jack the Ripper\\". Unlike the earlier versions, the film is set in 1888, rather than in the year of the film's making.Meikle, p. 56 The 1953 version, Man in the Attic with Jack Palance as \\"Slade\\", covers much the same ground.Meikle, pp. 61‚Äì63 The 2009 film casts Simon Baker as \\"Malcolm Slaight\\". Sketch of Eric Porter as the character \\"Dr John Pritchard\\" in Hands of the Ripper. In the film, the kindly Dr Pritchard adopts the Ripper's murderous daughter.Meikle, p. 121 Room to Let (1949) is similar to The Lodger story but was based on a 1948 radio play by Margery Allingham. It was one of the first horror pictures made by Hammer Film Productions.Woods and Baddeley, p. 196 Valentine Dyall plays the lodger, \\"Dr. Fell\\", who has escaped from a lunatic asylum where he has been incarcerated for 16 years since committing the Whitechapel murders.Meikle, pp. 59‚Äì61 Hammer released two Ripper-inspired films in 1971. In Hands of the Ripper, the Ripper's daughter (played by Angharad Rees) grows up to become a murderess after she sees her father kill her mother.Meikle, p. 121; Woods and Baddeley, p. 200 In Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, Dr. Henry Jekyll transforms into the evil predatory woman Sister Hyde and is also responsible for the Ripper murders.Meikle, p. 125; Woods and Baddeley, p. 199 In Terror in the Wax Museum (1973), a murderer disguises himself as a waxwork of the Ripper.Meikle, p. 129 The Veil episode \\"Jack the Ripper\\" (1958) is a made-for-television film introduced by Boris Karloff, in which a clairvoyant identifies the Ripper as a respectable surgeon whose death has been faked to cover his incarceration in a lunatic asylum.Meikle, p. 67 The story's basis was an 1895 newspaper report that Robert James Lees had used psychic powers to track the Ripper to the home of a London physician.Meikle, p. 68 Jack the Ripper (1959), produced by Monty Berman and Robert S. Baker and written by Jimmy Sangster, is loosely based on Leonard Matters' theory that the Ripper was an avenging doctor.Meikle, pp. 75‚Äì79; Woods and Baddeley, p. 198 It borrowed icons from previously successful horror films, such as Dracula (1958) and The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), by giving the Ripper a costume of a top hat and cape.Woods and Baddeley, p. 197 The plot is a standard \\"whodunit\\" with the usual false leads and a denouement in which the least likely character, in this case \\"Sir David Rogers\\" played by Ewen Solon, is revealed as the culprit.Meikle, pp. 76‚Äì77 As in Matters' book, The Mystery of Jack the Ripper, Solon's character murders prostitutes to avenge the death of his son. However, Matters used the ploy of the son dying from venereal disease, while the film has him committing suicide on learning his lover is a prostitute.Meikle, p. 79 In a reversal of this formula, the German film Das Ungeheuer von London City (1964), released as The Monster of London City in 1967, casts the son as the villain with the father as the victim of syphilis.Meikle, pp. 86‚Äì87 Pandora's Box (Die B√ºchse der Pandora) is a 1929 German silent film directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst based on Frank Wedekind's play about a woman, Lulu, played by Louise Brooks. Her uninhibited lifestyle leads her to walk the streets of London until she meets her end in an encounter with Jack the Ripper, played by Gustav Diessl.Meikle, p. 33‚Äì34; Woods and Baddeley, p. 165 An earlier German film, Paul Leni's Waxworks (Das Wachsfigurenkabinett) from 1924, used a Ripper-style event in one of three dreamed vignettes.Woods and Baddeley, pp. 166‚Äì167 The \\"Jack\\" character was played by Werner Krauss, who had achieved enormous success with his portrayal of the evil title character in the influential early horror film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.Meikle, p. 30 A Study in Terror (1965) and Murder by Decree (1979) both pit Sherlock Holmes against the Ripper. A Study in Terror, and its companion novel written by Ellery Queen,Meikle, p. 99; Woods and Baddeley, p. 150 feature the often insane family of the Duke of Shires, with a motive provided by one of his son's becoming enamoured of a prostitute.Meikle, pp. 92‚Äì99 Murder by Decree, starring Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes and James Mason as Watson, follows the masonic/royal conspiracy plotline popularised by Stephen Knight, in which a royal physician is the murderer. Coincidentally, in both movies, character actor Frank Finlay plays Inspector Lestrade.Meikle, p. 150 Part of the conspiracy plotline was followed in the television miniseries Jack the Ripper (1988) starring Michael Caine as Inspector Frederick Abberline. In the 1997 film The Ripper, Samuel West starred as Prince Eddy, who was revealed as the Ripper, and Love Lies Bleeding (1999 film) featured Paul Rhys, Emily Raymond and Faye Dunaway in another film. In 2001, the Hughes Brothers made the comic book From Hell into a film of the same name starring Johnny Depp as Abberline. The film again sticks to the Knight storyline, though Depp's character differs significantly from Caine's heroic Abberline and exhibits aspects of both Sherlock Holmes (deductive powers, drug addiction) and Robert Lees (psychic ability, foresight). Peter Barnes' stage play The Ruling Class (1968) and its film adaptation (1972) are satires on the British aristocracy that link the Ripper to the British upper class. Jack Gurney, the mentally ill 14th Earl of Gurney (played in the film version by Peter O'Toole), spends part of the plot believing himself to be Jack the Ripper, and performs a pair of Ripper murders. The black comedy Deadly Advice (1994) features Jane Horrocks as a serial killer who imagines that she is given advice by the incarnations of famous murderers. John Mills plays Jack the Ripper as an outwardly mild- mannered hairdresser. \\"Just be the sort of person nobody suspects,\\" he tells her.Meikle, p. 171 In an earlier black comedy, Dr. Strangelove, the antagonist is named General Jack D. Ripper, but the comparison goes no deeper.Meikle, p. 88; Woods and Baddeley, p. 69 Amazon Women on the Moon is a 1987 comedy film that parodies theories of the Ripper's identity by speculating that Jack the Ripper was the Loch Ness Monster in disguise.Meikle, pp. 205‚Äì206; Woods and Baddeley, p. 73 Marcel Carn√©'s Dr√¥le de Drame (1937) is another parody of the Ripper, featuring Jean-Louis Barrault as an East End vegetarian who slaughters butchers in revenge for their slaughter of animals.Cullen, p. 249 In Shanghai Knights (2003) Jack the Ripper attempts to murder the sister of Jackie Chan's character only for her to angrily kick him off a bridge. Night After Night After Night (1970) was a low-budget production that cast a high court judge (played by Jack May) as a demented copycat Ripper who attacks prostitutes in London's Soho.Meikle, pp. 100‚Äì101 Throughout the 1970s and 1980s tenuous links with the Ripper case were introduced into films for commercial reasons; sexploitation horror movies Blade of the Ripper (1970), The Ripper of Notre Dame (1981) and The New York Ripper (1982) have little relation to the Ripper beyond the title.Meikle, p. 155‚Äì157, 183; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 203‚Äì204 The Ripper of Notre Dame was directed and co-written by Jes√∫s Franco, whose Jack the Ripper (1976) stars Klaus Kinski as a murderous doctor whose mother was a prostitute.Meikle, p. 104 What the Swedish Butler Saw (1975), in which Jack the Ripper hides in a photographic studio, is little more than softcore pornography.Meikle, p. 140 Thrillers Jack the Mangler of London (1973), Fear City (1984), Night Ripper (1986) and Jack's Back (1988) received poor reviews,Meikle, pp. 102‚Äì103, 156, 159‚Äì160; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 204‚Äì205 as did the Japanese pink film Assault! Jack the Ripper.Woods and Baddeley, p. 206 Edge of Sanity (1989) is lent \\"post-Psycho gravitas\\" by the casting of Anthony Perkins as \\"Dr Jekyll\\" and his alter-ego \\"Jack Hyde\\", but was still condemned by critics \\"as a tasteless exercise\\".Woods and Baddeley, p. 207 The Dolph Lundgren vehicle Jill the Ripper (2000) reverses the traditional genders of victims and villains, with a female Ripper and male victims.Meikle, p. 183 In Time After Time (1979), based on the novel of the same title, Jack escapes in a time machine to modern-day San Francisco and is pursued by H. G. Wells. The pursuer was originally slated to be Robert Louis Stevenson in a link to the author of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, but he was written out in favour of Wells.Meikle, pp. 136‚Äì137; Woods and Baddeley, p. 205 In Terror at London Bridge (1985), starring David Hasselhoff, Jack's spirit is transported to Arizona in a cursed stone from London Bridge.Meikle, pp. 157‚Äì158; Woods and Baddeley, p. 205 In The Ripper (1985), his spirit is instead concealed in a cursed ring. Ripper Man (1994) depicts a killer who believes himself to be the reincarnation of George Chapman, who was suspected of being Jack the Ripper after his arrest and execution for murder in 1903.Meikle, pp. 173‚Äì174 Released in the same year as From Hell, and consequently overshadowed by it,Woods and Baddeley, p. 213 were Ripper and Bad Karma (retitled as Hell's Gate). Ripper centres on psychology student Molly Keller (played by A. J. Cook) who studies serial killers. Her classmates start dying at the hands of a Jack the Ripper copycat, who targets victims with the same initials as the originals.Meikle, p. 200 Bad Karma is another play on the reincarnation theme with the addition of Patsy Kensit as the Ripper's female accomplice.Meikle, pp. 185‚Äì186 Television By the 1960s, the Ripper was established in American television as a \\"universal force of evil\\", who could be adapted to suit any villainous niche.Meikle, pp. 131‚Äì133 In an episode of The Twilight Zone from 1963 entitled \\"The New Exhibit\\", Martin Balsam plays the curator of a wax museum who becomes so obsessed by five wax figures of murderers, including Jack the Ripper, that he commits murder to protect them.Meikle, p. 115 In the Star Trek episode \\"Wolf in the Fold\\" (1967), writer Robert Bloch reused parts of his short-story \\"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\\", which had already appeared as a 1961 television episode of Thriller. In the episode, the Ripper turned out to be a long-lived non-corporeal being that had committed mass murders on many worlds over centuries to generate fear, the emotion on which it fed. The entity is beamed out into space. In the Cimarron Strip episode \\"Knife in the Wilderness\\" (1968), written by Harlan Ellison, Jack continues his work across America ending in Cimarron City where he meets his end at the hands of Indians.Meikle, pp. 117‚Äì118 In the Get Smart episode \\"House of Max\\" (1970), Jack the Ripper is an animated wax dummy.Woods and Baddeley, p. 171 In The Sixth Sense episode \\"With Affection, Jack the Ripper\\" (1972) a man is driven mad during a paranormal experiment when he inhabits the body of Jack the Ripper.Meikle, p. 133 A Fantasy Island episode, also titled \\"With Affection, Jack the Ripper\\" (1980), was written by the same writer as the episode of The Sixth Sense, Don Ingalls. Lynda Day George plays criminologist Lorraine Peters who uses a time portal to confirm her suspicion that Jack the Ripper was a doctor, Albert Fell, played by Victor Buono. Fell follows her back through the portal, grabs Peters and takes her back to 1888, where the enigmatic Mr. Roarke intervenes fortuitously, and Fell dies moments later while fleeing.Meikle, p. 139 The name Fell is clearly lifted from Margery Allingham's 1948 radio play Room to Let. A time portal is also used in \\"A Rip in Time\\" (1997), the first episode of the short-lived television series Timecop, in which a time travelling cop travels back to 1888 to catch a criminal who has killed, and displaced, Jack the Ripper.Meikle, p. 180 The Babylon 5 episode \\"Comes the Inquisitor\\" (1995) features a character named Sebastian who is Jack the Ripper, abducted by the alien Vorlons in the year 1888 and made into their inquisitor so that he can test (through torture) beings who are called to lead an important cause.Meikle, pp. 175‚Äì176 In the TV series Grimm, the final three episodes of the fourth season reveal that Jack the Ripper was a spirit that initially manifested over a century before the Whitechapel murders; the Jack spirit possesses one of the series protagonists after a near-death experience, but the others are able to 'exorcise' Jack by shooting his host with rubber bullets to trick Jack into thinking that his host was being murdered. The idea of the Ripper as a supernatural entity is used again in the third season of the television series Sleepy Hollow, with the 'killer' in this case being a knife that drives its wielder to act on their darker impulses as it absorbs the blood of its victims; it is defeated when it is tricked into stabbing someone with malaria, the infection tainting the blood and thus weakening the blade. Jack the Ripper (1973) by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd linked with the police drama Z-Cars. The program featured Z Cars detectives Barlow and Watt, played by Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor respectively, investigating the murders from an historical perspective.Knight, p. 16; Meikle, p. 142; Rumbelow, p. 223; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 150‚Äì151 In the first episode of Kolchak: The Night Stalker (1974), titled \\"The Ripper\\", reporter Carl Kolchak pursues a supernatural killer whose victims match the patterns of the original Ripper murders. The killer has superhuman strength and is invulnerable to weapons, but Kolchak dematerialises the apparently immortal being by electrocuting him.Meikle, pp. 135‚Äì136 In an episode of the NBC television series Voyagers! (1982-1983), American journalist Nellie Bly is attacked in London, but her assailant runs off when time-travelers Phineas Bogg and Jeffrey Jones (the titular Voyagers) arrive on the scene.

Windmills in general had been known to civilization for centuries, but the tower mill represented an improvement on traditional western-style windmills. The tower mill was an important source of power for Europe for nearly 600 years from 1300‚Äì1900, contributing to 25 percent of the industrial power of all wind machines before the advent of the steam engine and coal power.Righter, Wind energy in America: A History, (1996) 15 It represented a modification or a demonstration of improving and adapting technology that had been known by humans for ages. Although these types of mills were effective, some argue that, owing to their complexity, they would have initially been built mainly by the most wealthy individuals.Langdon, Mills in the medieval economy: England, 1300‚Äì1540 (2004), 115 History The tower mill originated in written history in the late 13th century in western Europe; the earliest record of its existence is from 1295, from Stephen de Pencastor of Dover, but the earliest illustrations date from 1390.Hills, Power from wind: a history of windmill technology, (1996) 51‚Äì60 Other early examples come from Yorkshire and Buckinghamshire.Langdon, Mills in the medieval economy: England, 1300‚Äì1540 (2004), 114 Other sources pin its earliest inception back in 1180 in the form of an illustration on a Norman deed, showing this new western-style windmill.A short history of technology: from the earliest times to A.D. 1900 (1993), 254 The Netherlands has six mills recorded before the year 1407. One of the earliest tower mills in Britain was Chesterton Mill, Warwickshire, which has a hollowed conical base with arches. The large part of its development continued through the Late Middle Ages, towards the end of the 15th century tower mills began appearing across Europe in greater numbers. Alford Windmill The origins of the tower mill can be found in a growing economy of Europe, which needed a more reliable and efficient form of power, especially one that could be used away from a river bank. Post mills dominated the scene in Europe until the 19th century when tower mills began to replace them in such places as Billingford Mill in Norfolk, Upper Hellesden Mill in Norwich, and Stretham Mill in Cambridgeshire.Hills, Power from wind: a history of windmill technology, (1996), 65 The tower mill also was seen as a cultural object, being painted and designed with aesthetic appeal in mind. Styles of the mills reflected on local tradition and weather conditions, for example mills built on the western coast of Britain were mainly built of stone to withstand the stronger winds, and those built in the east were mainly of brick.Hills, Power from wind: a history of windmill technology, (1996), 63 Foulsham tower mill, five stories of brick, early 1800s. Burned 1912 and converted to private residence. In England around 12 eight-sailers, more than 50 six- and 50 five- sailers were built in the late 18th century and 19th century, half of them in Lincolnshire. Of the eight sailed mills only Pocklington's Mill in Heckington survived in fully functional state. A few of the other ones exist as four- sailed mills (Old Buckenham), as residences (Diss Button's Mill), as ruins (Leach's Windmill, Wisbech), or have been dismantled (Holbeach Mill; Skirbeck Mill, Boston). In Lincolnshire some of the six-sailed (Sibsey Trader Mill, Waltham Windmill) and five-sailed (Dobson's Mill in Burgh le Marsh, Maud Foster Windmill in Boston, Hoyle's Mill in Alford) slender (mostly tarred) tower mills with their white onion-shaped cap and a huge fantail are still there and working today. Other former five- and six-sailed Lincolnshire and Yorkshire tower mills now without sails and partly without cap are LeTall's Mill in Lincoln, Holgate Windmill in Holgate, York (currently being restored), Black, Cliff, or Whiting's Mill (a seven-storeyed chalk mill) in Hessle and (with originally six sails) Barton-upon-Humber Tower mill, Brunswick Mill in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, Metheringham Windmill, Penny Hill Windmill in Holbeach, Wragby Mill (built by E. Ingledew in 1831, millwright of Heckington Mill in 1830), and Wellingore Tower Mill. Another fine six-sailer can be found in Derbyshire ‚Äì England's only sandstone towered windmill at Heage of 1791. Design Dutch windmill De Noord, Schiedam The advantage of the tower mill over the earlier post mill is that it is not necessary to turn the whole mill (\\"body\\", \\"buck\\") with all its machinery into the wind; this allows more space for the machinery as well as for storage. However, select tower mills found around Holland were constructed on a wooden frame so as to rotate the entire foundation of the mill along with the cap. These towers were often constructed out of wood rather than masonry as well.Journal of the Franklin Institute, Volume 187 (1919), 177Miller in Eighteenth Century Virginia (1958), 7 A movable head which could pivot to react to the changing wind patterns was the most important aspect of the tower mill. This ability gave the advantage of a larger and more stable frame that could deal with harsh weather. Also, only moving a cap was much easier than moving an entire structure. In the earliest tower mills the cap was turned into the wind with a long tail-pole which stretched down to the ground at the back of the mill. Later an endless chain was used which drove the cap through gearing. In 1745 an English engineer, Edmund Lee, invented the windmill fantail ‚Äì a little windmill mounted at right angles to the sails, at the rear of the mill, and which turned the cap automatically to bring it into the wind.Cipolla Before the industrial revolution: European society and economy, 1000‚Äì1700 (1994), 144 Like other windmills tower mills have normally four blades. To increase windmill efficiency millwrights experimented with different methods: * automated patent-sails instead of cloth spread type sails didn't need the sail cross to be stopped to spread or remove the cloth sails because they altered the surface from inside the mill by means of a controlling gear. * more than four blades to increase the sail surface. Therefore, engineer John Smeaton invented the cast-iron Lincolnshire cross to make sail-crosses with five, six, and even eight blades possible. The cross was named after Lincolnshire where it was most widely used. There are several components to the tower mill as it was in the 19th Century in Europe in its most developed stage, some elements such as the gallery are not present in all tower mills:http://visual.merriam- webster.com/energy/wind-energy/windmill/tower-mill.php visited 23 November 2009 * Stock ‚Äì the arm that protrudes from the top of windmill holding the frame of the sail in place, this is the main support of the sail and is usually made of wood. * Sail ‚Äì the turning frame that catches the wind, attached and held by the stock. The traditional style found on most tower mills is a four-sail frame, however in the Mediterranean model there is usually an eight-sail frame. An example of this in St. Mary's Mill on the Isle of Sicilly constructed in 1820. * Windshaft ‚Äì A particularly important part of the sail frame, the windshaft is the cylindrical piece that translates the movement of the sail into the machinery within the windmill. * Cap ‚Äì The top of the tower that holds the sail and stock, this piece is able to rotate on top of the tower. * Tower ‚Äì Supports the cap, the main structure of the tower mill. * Floor ‚Äì Base level of the tower inside, usually where grain or other products are stored. * Gallery ‚Äì Deck surrounding the floor outside the tower to provide access around the tower mill if it is raised, not present in all tower mills. The gallery allowed access to the sails for making repairs because they could not be easily reached from the ground in larger mills.Ball, Natural sources of power (1908), 248 * Frame ‚Äì Sail design that forms the outline of the sail, usually a meshed wood design that then is covered in cloth. The Mediterranean design is different in that there are several sails on the sail-frame and each supports a draped cloth and there is no wooden frame behind it. * Fantail ‚Äì Orientation device that is attached to the cap, allowing it to rotate to keep the sails in the direction of the wind. * Hemlath ‚Äì Thick wooden sailbar on the side of the frame that keeps the narrower sailbars inside the sail. * Sailbar ‚Äì Elongated piece of wood that forms a sail. * Sail cloth ‚Äì Cloth attached to a sail that collects wind energy; a large sail cloth is used for weak winds and a small sail cloth for strong winds. Application The tower mill was more powerful than the water mill, able to generate roughly 20 to 30 horsepower.Cipolla, Before the industrial revolution: European society and economy, 1000‚Äì1700 (1994), 144 There were many uses that the tower mill had aside from grinding corn. Tower Mills fueled a society that was steadily growing in its need for power by providing a service to other industries as well:Wind energy in America: A History (1996), 15 * The production of pepper and other spices * Lumber companies used them for powering sawmills * Paper companies used to change wood pulp into paper Other sources argue against this claiming there is no real evidence, specifically, of tower mills doing these things. Interesting facts Ta' Buleben Windmill, in Zabbar, served as the Windmill Redoubt during the French occupation of Malta. The world's tallest tower mills can be found in Schiedam, Netherlands with the highest mill being De Nolet (built in 2006 as a \\"generator mill\\" producing electricity and named after the local Nolet distilling family the mill belongs to, 140 ft / 42.5 metres to cap) and De Noord (The North, corn mill of 1803), 109 ft / 33.5 metres to cap) both in working order. England's tallest tower mill is the nine-storeyed Moulton Windmill in Moulton, Lincolnshire, with a cap height of 97.5 ft / 30 metres. Since 2005 the mill has a new white rotatable cap with windshaft and fantail in place, the stage was erected during 2008 and new sails were fitted on 21 November 2011 to complete the restoration of the mill. In the Netherlands windmills named torenmolens (tower mills) have a compact-built, cylindric or only slightly conical tower. In the southern Netherlands four mills of that type (Dutch definition) survived, the oldest one built before 1441. The cap of three of those mills is turned by a luffing gear built in the cap. Older types of the tower mill could be found on castles, fortresses or city walls with a fixed cap since the 14th century, and are still be found around the Mediterranean Sea. They were built with the sails facing the prevailing wind direction. Tower mills were very expensive to build with estimates suggesting almost twice that of post mills, which is in part why they were not very prevalent until centuries after invention. Sometimes these mills were even built on the sides of castles and towers in fortified towns to make them resistant to attacks. Some tower mills were still in operation well into the 20th century in the southern parts of the United Kingdom.Wind, water, work: ancient and medieval milling technology (2006), 122 Citations References *Lucas, Adam .

It is situated in the middle of the Gordano valley on the north side, and in the Unitary Authority of North Somerset, on the road between Clevedon and Portishead. The parish has a population of 301. It is the largest village in the valley, with a public house, the 18th century White Hart, and a garage. History The parish of Weston was part of the Portbury Hundred. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography There are two nearby nature reserves, both owned and managed by the Avon Wildlife Trust. Weston Big Wood is 38 hectares of ancient woodland, and Weston Moor is 59 hectares of wet grassland. Weston Big Wood falls within a wider biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The wood itself dates at least from Iron Age times, with some evidence that there has been woodland here since trees began to recolonise after the last Ice Age some 10,000 years ago. Some of its internal features e.g. old stones, ditches and banks are thought to be medieval boundaries, dating from the Middle Ages and used to divide the wood into sectors. Adjacent to the wood on its southern side is a large quarry. The woodland sits on a ridge of Carboniferous Limestone, and its slopes are covered with small-leaved lime trees; oak and hazel are more common on flatter hilltop areas. Rare whitebeams are also dotted throughout the wood. The rare plant purple gromwell is found at the site.English Nature citation sheet for the site . Retrieved 16 July 2006.Myles (2000), page 168 Other flowers include; wood anemones, violets and bluebells. The presence of other plants such as herb paris and yellow archangel together with the purple gromwell, show that this wood is ancient. There is a wide coppiced open area inside the wood, created as a butterfly feature as part of the reserve management work, called \\"The Ride\\". Butterflies such as the orange tip, speckled wood and purple hairstreak can be seen in the area in summer. The birds commonly seen, include woodpecker, nuthatch, and tawny owl. Bats also roost in the trees, and the presence of many setts indicates a large badger population. Middle Hill Common is an area of grassland and wild flower meadow, which supports invertebrates and butterflies. Weston-in-Gordano SSSI is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest and Geological Conservation Review site because temporary exposures here have shown Pleistocene sediments, including interglacial fluvial sands and marine gravels and cold-stage fluvial gravels.

The parish includes the hamlet of Sheepway which is situated on the moorland at the northern edge of the Gordano valley, between the Gordano services on the M5 motorway and Portishead, near the Royal Portbury Dock. The parish has a population of 827. History The Romans are known to have had a wharf or hard at Portbury, probably for shipbuilding, as the commander of the logistics port of Ad Sabrinam at Seamills was charged with supplying ships to carry troops and supplies to the legions across the Severn in South Wales. It was used for the export of lead and tin from mines on the Mendip Hills. Sheepway (Old English schip weg) - the port of Portbury - was probably in use in later, Saxon, times. The Marina dock in Portishead had a right-angled southern dogleg navigable down to Sheepway, giving the town its name - the \\"Port's headland\\". Portbury is mentioned in the Exeter Domesday Book (Liber Exoniensis) and was given by William the Conqueror to his second favourite, Bishop Geoffrey de Mowbray of Coutances ‚Äî the \\"battling bishop\\" - sword in one hand and crook in the other. (Favourite No. 1 was Bishop Odo of Bayeux, who was William's half-brother and was given the Sussex Godwin land around Bosham.) Bishop Geoffrey crowned Duke William as King of England in a two-and-a-half-hour ceremony in French at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066; the English ceremony that followed took only 40 minutes. The manor had previously been held by the Godwin family, who were the most powerful family in the country. Godwin (d. 1053) was installed by King Cnut as the first Earl of Wessex; Harold, his son, was the loser at Hastings in 1066. His daughter Edith was queen to Edward the Confessor. So in Saxon times Portbury must have been an important place, but no pre-1066 record or trace exists. It first appears in written history in the Domesday Book in the Hundred of Portbury, a sub-division of the shire of Somerset. The Domesday Book states, \\"Godwin held it from the King\\": Godwin was Harold II's eldest son and also held the title of Sheriff of Somerset. From the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 1068 we know that Godwin returned from exile in Ireland with a small force \\"at the mouth of the River Avon\\", probably intent on recapture of the former manor, but was routed by Aolnoth, his father's 'Staller' (an adjutant position - now in Willam's employ). Aolnoth was killed in the confrontation, but his surviving family become the Berkeley dynasty - see below. There would have existed in Portbury itself a substantial manor house within defensive boundaries that would have held the court and storehouses for grain and weaponry. The village itself is small but in former times ruled over most of the Gordano valley and the remote satellite enclave of Hamgreen. In later Norman times Robert Fitzharding, the Reeve of Bristol (the King's local representative), was rewarded with the Manor of Portbury. He purchased other local manors and moved between them with his entourage of upwards of 200 people, so the manor house complex, yet to be found, must have been substantial. He was made the first Earl of Berkeley. It is said that his wife Eva never left Portbury after moving there, and subsequent Berkeley heirs were brought up there before Berkeley Castle was made a comfortable home. She founded the 'Whiteladies' convent of St. Mary Magdalene, hence giving Bristol two of its street names. He founded St. Augustine's Abbey, now the Bristol Cathedral. It is recorded that the Berkeley family preferred to spend Christmas at Portbury. There is a Berkeley Chantry chapel with early Berkeley family burials in St Mary's Church dating from around 1190. Descendants of the Berkeley family married into the family of Coke of Holcombe, Norfolk who held the manor until 1784, when it was sold to James Gordon and inherited by William Abdy. On his death in 1870 it was sold to Sir Greville Smyth of Long Ashton. Portbury had its own railway station on the Portishead line until the Beeching axe fell. The village main street was cut through by the M5 motorway opened in February 1973. Although the M5 is close, it has actually made the village much less busy as it was previously on the main through route from Bristol to Portishead, from St. Georges, Easton in Gordano and on through Sheepway to Old Bristol Road in Portishead. The Rudgleigh ‚Äî Easton Bypass and the Portbury Hundred either side of the motorway junction isolated Portbury from through traffic.

Starting in 1977 with the release of his first single, \\"I've Got a Feelin' (Somebody's Been Stealin')\\", Anderson has charted more than 40 singles on the Billboard country music charts, including five number ones: \\"Wild and Blue\\", \\"Swingin'\\", \\"Black Sheep\\", \\"Straight Tequila Night\\", and \\"Money in the Bank\\". He has also recorded 22 studio albums on several labels. His newest album, Years, was released on April 10, 2020, on the Easy Eye Sound label and was produced by Nashville veteran producer David Ferguson and Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. Anderson was inducted to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame on October 5, 2014. , nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com, October 6, 2014; accessed January 3, 2015. Early career Raised in Apopka, Florida, Anderson's first musical influences were not country artists, but rock and roll musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones. He played in a rock band until the age of 15, when he discovered the music of George Jones and Merle Haggard and turned to country music. Anderson moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1971, arriving unannounced at his sister's home, and took on odd jobs during the day ‚Äì including one as a roofer at the Grand Ole Opry House ‚Äì while playing in clubs during the evenings. The club appearances finally paid off in 1977 when he signed his first recording contract with Warner Bros. Records. He first hit the Billboard Country chart in 1977 with the song \\"I‚Äôve Got a Feelin‚Äô (Somebody's Been Stealin')\\", then broke into the country Top 40 with \\"The Girl at the End of the Bar\\" the next year. Anderson's decidedly backwoods accent and distinctive vocal timbre helped land him in the forefront of the \\"New Traditionalist\\" movement with artists like Ricky Skaggs and George Strait. A steady stream of singles through the late 1970s and early 1980s continued to build Anderson's name in the country genre. The song \\"I'm Just an Old Chunk of Coal (But I'm Gonna Be a Diamond Someday)\\" from the 1981 album John Anderson 2 netted Anderson a Grammy Award nomination for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. \\"Swingin'\\" and mainstream success The release of Anderson's fourth album, Wild & Blue, in 1982 led to his breakthrough to mainstream country when the single \\"Swingin'\\" hit the airwaves early the next year. Co-written with long-time writing partner, Lionel Delmore, the song broke into the country charts and reached Number One by March, while at the same time crossing over to the Billboard Hot 100, reaching a peak of Number 43. The single became the biggest selling record in the history of Warner Bros. Records. In the wake of \\"Swingin'\\", Anderson received five nominations for Country Music Association awards for the year. He was the winner of the Horizon Award, and the song was named Single of the Year; he also received nominations for Song of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, and Album of the Year. Anderson's success with Wild & Blue carried on through several more albums, but none would match its chart numbers or sales. In 1986, Anderson and Warner Bros. parted ways. Seminole Wind and later career  After leaving Warner Bros., Anderson signed with MCA Records and released two albums under that label, followed by one with Capitol Records in 1990. Chart success was minimal throughout those years. However, that turned around in 1991 when Anderson joined BNA Records and, working with legendary country producer James Stroud, released the album Seminole Wind. Powered by the title single, which rose to Number Two, and the Number One single \\"Straight Tequila Night\\", the album proved a resurgence for Anderson's career. The album has been certified two times platinum, the highest of any of Anderson's albums, and he was nominated for three CMA Awards ‚Äì Male Vocalist, Song of the Year and Album of the Year. The success of Seminole Wind brought a fresh life to Anderson's career, and he released a number of albums that charted well, producing several more singles that pushed to the upper levels of the country charts. The 1993 album Solid Ground produced a Number One single, \\"Money in the Bank\\", which turned out to be the most recent chart-topper of Anderson's career. He recorded for BNA through 1996 before leaving the label. In 1993, Anderson was awarded the Academy of Country Music Career Achievement award. Anderson has recorded for several labels since his departure from BNA, with moderate chart success. An album entitled Bigger Hands, a return to working with Stroud as producer, was released in June 2009. Over his career, Anderson has collaborated with a number of different artists. He has worked with John Rich of Big & Rich on his 2007 album Easy Money, and co-wrote Rich's 2009 single \\"Shuttin' Detroit Down\\" He has been named an honorary member of the MuzikMafia, of which Rich is also a member. Anderson lives in Smithville, Tennessee, his home for more than 30 years with his wife and two daughters.

Early life and education Born sometime in December 1734, Green was the youngest son of Joshua Green, a prosperous farmer who lived near Swinton in Yorkshire. His education, according to his future brother-in-law William Wales, was chiefly at a school near Denmark Street in Soho, London. This school was run by his eldest brother, the clergyman Rev. John Green, and the younger Green went on to become an assistant teacher there, continuing his studies in astronomy until he joined the staff of the Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1760.  Career in astronomy  Green was appointed as Assistant to the Astronomer Royal, James Bradley, succeeding the astronomer Charles Mason who left to join the expedition to the Cape of Good Hope to observe the 1761 transit of Venus. Following Bradley's death in 1762, Green continued in the role of assistant for Bradley's successor Nathaniel Bliss. Due to the ill-health of Bliss, much of the work of practical observational astronomy devolved upon Green at this time. In 1763, Green, along with the astronomer Nevil Maskelyne, was instructed by the Board of Longitude to make the voyage to Barbados to act as monitors of the test of John Harrison's H4 chronometer, which was in the running for the Longitude Prize, the prize offered by the British Government for the devisor of an accurate method of determining the longitude of a ship at sea. Their duties, after they arrived in Barbados and were awaiting the chronometer's arrival on another ship, involved observation of the Galilean moons of Jupiter to determine the local longitude, and after the arrival of the mechanism which was in the care of Harrison's son William, the comparison of the results of the chronometer with their astronomical observations to judge the mechanism's accuracy. On the voyage to Barbados, the pair were also using their observations to determine the accuracy of the lunar distance method, Maskelyne's own method of calculating the longitude of a ship at sea. An argument ensued between Maskelyne and William Harrison, which dragged in Green, as Harrison was of the opinion that Maskelyne was not an impartial observer and was a rival of his father in the pursuit of the Longitude Prize. A compromise was reached in which the monitoring of the Harrison mechanism was undertaken by Maskelyne and Green on alternate days. Green's return to England in the autumn of 1764 coincided with the death of Nathaniel Bliss; Green returned to Greenwich to continue Bliss' work until the appointment of a new Astronomer Royal. The new Astronomer Royal proved to be Nevil Maskelyne. Green briefly served under him as assistant, but left Greenwich after a disagreement with his new superior. Wales' account says that Green was involved in a survey to determine the feasibility of transporting water from the River Colne to provide water to Marylebone in London, although Green's survey confirmed the fears of mill owners downstream that the canal would result in a failure of the water supply needed for their operations and led to the scheme being dropped. Although this is unmentioned in Wales's short biography, Green is recorded as being the purser on HMS Aurora in 1768. In that same year, the Royal Society appointed him to accompany James Cook's voyage to observe the 1769 transit of Venus; despite their earlier disagreement, Maskelyne who was serving on the Society's Transit of Venus Committee recommended his former assistant for the post.  Voyage of the Endeavour and the Transit of Venus  Sketchings of the 1769 Venus Transit by Captain James Cook and Charles Green, showing the black drop effect. Green joined Cook's first voyage of circumnavigation in 1768, accompanied by a servant. Green was one of two official astronomers appointed by the Royal Society to observe the transit; the other was Cook himself, who was a capable observer in his own right. Green was to receive 200 guineas from the Society for the appointment. (Cook was to receive 100 guineas for his role in making the observations.) The Society provided instruments for the expedition, including two reflector telescopes built by James Short, two clocks and an astronomical quadrant; these were supplemented by a telescope in the possession of Daniel Solander and another provided by the Navy. The expedition arrived at Tahiti, the chosen site for the observation of the transit, on 11 April 1769, anchoring in Matavai Bay on the north-western coast of the island two days later. A camp (Fort Venus) was established and the astronomical equipment was in place by the start of May. Of paramount importance for Green was the calculation of an accurate position of the location, which he calculated using the lunar distance method and by observation of the moons of Jupiter. The removal of the quadrant from the camp - either by the local Tahitians or by members of the expedition who traded it to the Tahitians \\\\- threatened to derail the enterprise, but it was soon recovered, albeit disassembled into pieces and with some damage, by the expedition botanist Joseph Banks, accompanied by Green. The day of the transit, June 3, was a clear day and the transit was visible in its entirety. Although Cook had taken the precaution of sending two groups to outlying islands, the principal observation party remained at Fort Venus, where Green, Cook and (independently) Solander recorded the times of the transit. Cook noted in his log that the times recorded by the three observers for the times of contact differed significantly; this anomaly, now generally attributed to the black drop effect, would cast significant doubt, in the eyes of the Royal Society and Nevil Maskelyne, on the usefulness and value of the observations later. = Criticism of Green and his observations = Due to Green's death on the homeward voyage, the work of collating and analysing his results fell first to Cook, and ultimately to Nevil Maskelyne. Cook admitted that Green's papers were in a disorganised state, when he inspected them after Green's death, and that some of the timings were inconsistently recorded in various of the astronomer's papers. The Astronomer Royal was critical of Green's work, especially of the observations Green made to calculate the latitude and longitude of Fort Venus. It has been noted that although the times for the contacts given by the three observers (Green, Cook and Solander) present at Fort Venus vary, they show no pattern of inconsistency attributable to one observer alone.  Subsequent voyage of the Endeavour and the death of Green  Following the departure from Tahiti, the Endeavour continued south- westwards as Cook carried out his orders to further explore the Southern Ocean. The expedition reached New Zealand in October 1769, giving Green an opportunity to observe the transit of Mercury from land. A landing was made at an inlet that would be subsequently called Mercury Bay on 3 November; the transit was successfully observed by Green on November 9. On reaching Australia, and during Cook's voyage along the coast, he named an island, Green Island, after the astronomer in June 1770. Green, by this time had contracted scurvy. The Endeavour was forced to make for Batavia (present-day Jakarta) for repairs. Disease were rife in the Dutch-controlled city, including malaria and dysentery; Green contracted the latter, dying on 29 January 1771, twelve days after the ship's departure from the port. Cook, in recording Green's death in his log, went on to add that Green had been in ill-health for some time and his lifestyle had contributed to his early death. An account published in a London newspaper described his final hours: \\"He had been ill some time, and was directed by the surgeon to keep himself warm, but in a fit of phrensy he got up in the night and put his legs out of the portholes, which was the occasion of his death.\\"  Personal life  Green married Elizabeth Long in March 1768 in London; the records of the Royal Society mention making a provision of ¬£50 per annum for his wife for the duration of the expedition. Green's sister Mary married the astronomer William Wales, who was part of a Royal Society expedition to Hudson Bay to observe the 1769 transit of Venus and who replaced Green for Cook's next voyage.

For other entries on The Europeans, see The Europeans (disambiguation). The Europeans: A sketch is a short novel by Henry James, published in 1878. It is essentially a comedy contrasting the behaviour and attitudes of two visitors from Europe with those of their relatives living in the 'new' world of New England. The novel first appeared as a serial in The Atlantic Monthly for July‚ÄìOctober 1878. James made numerous minor revisions for the first book publication. Plot introduction The tale opens in Boston and New England in the middle of the 19th century, and describes the experiences of two European siblings shifting from the old to the new world. The two protagonists are Eugenia M√ºnster and Felix Young, who since their early childhood have lived in Europe, moving from France to Italy and from Spain to Germany. In this last place, Eugenia entered into a Morganatic marriage with Prince Adolf of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein, the younger brother of the reigning prince who is now being urged by his family to dissolve the marriage for political reasons. Because of this, Eugenia and Felix decide to travel to America to meet their distant cousins, so that Eugenia may \\"seek her fortune\\" in the form of a wealthy American husband. All the cousins live in the countryside around Boston and spend a lot of time together. The first encounter with them corresponds to the first visit of Felix to his family. Mr Wentworth's family is a puritanical one, far from the Europeans' habits. Felix is fascinated by the patriarchal Mr Wentworth, his son, Clifford, age 20, and two daughters, Gertrude and Charlotte. They spend a lot of time together with Mr. Robert Acton and his sister Lizzie, their neighbours and cousins. Eugenia's reaction after this first approach differs from Felix's. She realizes she could not live with these relatives, so different from herself, but is happy to accept the gift of a little house--she cherishes her independence and in keeping a certain distance. In contrast, her brother is very happy to share all his time with Charlotte and Gertrude, spending hours in their piazza or garden creating portraits of the two ladies. Plot summary Eugenia and her brother Felix arrive in Boston. The next day Felix visits their cousins. He first meets Gertrude, who is shirking attendance at church and reading romantic literature instead. He stays over for dinner. The next day Eugenia visits them. Three days later their uncle Mr Wentworth suggests they stay in a little house close to theirs. Felix suggests making a portrait of his uncle. When Mr. Wentworth refuses, he makes plans to do a painting of Gertrude instead. One day, Gertrude, out walking, encounters a young clergyman, Mr Brand who has been waiting for her. He renews his declaration of love, but Gertrude does not wish to hear it, and asks him to go away, weeping afterwards out of frustration (for her family is pushing her to accept Mr. Brand). She then sits for Felix who is doing her portrait. During their conversation he wonders why his American relatives seem so little concerned for the pleasures of life, living by strict standards, seeming not to think of their own individual happiness. Eugenia notices the one eligible (and wealthy) bachelor, Robert Acton, cousin to the Wentworths, and they begin spending time together. Eugenia refers little to her marriage other than telling Mr. Acton she has a paper the husband's family wishes her to sign (which would dissolve the marriage.) She pays a visit to Mrs Acton and during their conversation tells a white lie ‚Äì that her son has been talking about her a lot ‚Äì which comes across as a faux-pas. In particular, Robert Acton notes the little untruth. Mr Wentworth tells Felix that his young son Clifford got suspended from Harvard owing to his drinking problem. Felix suggests that the influence of a cultivated older woman might help him to improve his manners‚Äîa woman such as his sister, and indeed, the young Clifford begins visiting Eugenia. Meanwhile, Felix and Gertrude are falling in love. Eventually, Gertrude tells him her father wants her to marry the minister Mr Brand, though she doesn't love him. Felix has noticed how Gertrude's sister Charlotte seems attracted to Mr. Brand, he is convinced she is in love with him, and he speaks to Mr. Brand, implying as much. He and Gertrude would like to see Mr. Brand and Charlotte get together‚Äîthat would leave him and Gertrude free to pursue their own love affair. One evening, Robert Acton who has been away a few days (and is beginning to believe he is in love with Eugenia) goes late to visit her. In fact, Clifford was with Eugenia at the time, but when she realized Robert was coming she had Clifford hide in a back room. During her conversation with Mr. Acton, the subject of her marriage comes up again, and he also proposes they go together‚Äîalone‚Äîto see Niagara Falls. Clifford comes unexpectedly out of his hiding place and there is a very awkward moment. Clifford leaves and Eugenia makes up an untrue story about the young man being at her home. Later, in talking with Clifford, Mr. Acton realizes she had not told the truth, and the fact that she can lie begins to weigh upon his thoughts, and he ceases for several days to go visit her. Meanwhile, Felix tells his sister Eugenia he wants to marry Gertrude; she lies also to her brother in claiming Robert Acton asked her to marry him but that she isn't sure she wants to. She has understood that her goal of finding a wealthy man in the United States has failed but she has her pride. She decides to go back to Germany. She makes a farewell visit to Mrs Acton, sees Robert as she is leaving and claims to have sent the annulation papers to Germany (this also will turn out to be untrue). Mr. Acton expresses regret that she has decided to leave‚Äîbut he makes no definitive proposition to her to keep her there. Felix makes a visit to his uncle and asks for Gertrude's hand. His uncle is shocked at first, but his other daughter, Charlotte, speaks in favor of the match, then Gertrude comes in and declares she will marry Felix, and finally Mr. Brand comes in to say he would like to marry the young couple. Felix has found his felicity in America‚Äîhe and Gertrude will marry and then live and travel in Europe‚Äîshe will see the world she has longed to see. Mr Brand and Charlotte will also later marry, far more suited to one another than Gertrude was for Mr. Brand. But the Baroness Eugenia M√ºnster, unsuccessful in her designs of seeking her fortune in America, refuses even to stay for her brother's wedding. She packs up her things, and returns to Europe.

Major themes One of the most important themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame M√ºnster is independent, modern, and displays hauteur. Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage between Mr. Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is difficult for her to clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to be in love with Felix. Her love encourages her to take a new perspective on the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America. The difference between Europeans and New Englanders manifests itself in particular in the expression of feelings and emotions, which are very sensitive for the former: love is more important than money. Moreover, American people are more straitlaced and they have closer links with tradition. The most important thing in life for those living in the 'New World' is, ironically, respecting old traditions and accepting moral rules. Mr Wentworth is profoundly surprised and fascinated by Eugenia's marriage experience as well as Robert Acton's; in the Americans' eyes, Eugenia is a perplexing woman. Literary significance and criticism The omniscient narrator uses a very fine and cultivated language, sometimes he prefers Latin diction; preferring to introduce very long, detailed descriptions of the setting and of the characters, from both a psychological and a physical point of view. In addition to the contributions of the narrator, dialogue helps the author to introduce his characters and to show their reactions to unfolding events. Critic Robert Gale credited James with a \\"specifically well-delineated New England\\" in the book, which he found \\"charming\\". F.R. Leavis, the influential English literary critic, had a high opinion of this brief work, claiming: :\\"The Europeans, the visiting cousins, are there mainly to provide a foil for the American family, a study of the New England ethos being James's essential purpose.... Nevertheless James's irony is far from being unkind; he sees too much he admires in the ethos he criticises to condemn it.... James is not condemning or endorsing either New England or Europe.... This small book, written so early in James's career, is a masterpiece of major quality.\\"The Great Tradition by F.R. Leavis (London: Chatto and Windus 1948) Others, most notably the author's brother William James, faulted the novel's \\"slightness.\\" Henry James replied in a 14 November 1878 letter that he somewhat agreed with the criticism: :\\"I was much depressed on reading your letter by your painful reflections on The Europeans, but now, an hour having elapsed, I am beginning to hold up my head a little; the more so as I think I myself estimate the book very justly & am aware of its extreme slightness. I think you take these things too rigidly and unimaginatively‚Äîtoo much as if an artistic experiment were a piece of conduct, to which one's life were somehow committed; but I think you're quite right in pronouncing the book 'thin' & empty.\\"The Correspondence of William James Vol.1: William and Henry 1861‚Äì1884 edited by Ignas Skrupskelis and Elizabeth Berkeley, p.308 (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press 1994) In another letter to his friend Elizabeth Boott, James blamed the shortness of the novel on the fact that the editor of the Atlantic Monthly, William Dean Howells, required that it occupy only 100 pages in the magazine. James had also promised Howells his next story would have a happy ending with \\"distinct matrimony\\" after the magazine serialized The American (1877), in which the lovers are separated in the end. According to James he \\"did [hit] it off mechanically in the closing paragraphs. I was not at all weary of the tale in the end, but I had agreed to write it in one hundred Atlantic pages, and its abrupt ending came from outward pressure - not from internal failing.\\" James excluded the novel from the New York Edition of his fiction (1907‚Äì09). Among others speculating on the reasons for this exclusion, critic Oscar Cargill commented that \\"the intimate contemporary judgment and misfortune may have been a lingering decisive factor in James' mind.\\" It has also been suggested by one author that Felix's rootless Bohemian origin, as well as his \\"eternal gaiety\\", were signifiers of his covert homosexuality.Eric Haralson, Henry James and Queer Modernity, Cambridge University Press, 2003, pages 50‚Äì51  Film adaptation  The 1979 Merchant Ivory Productions film The Europeans starred Lee Remick as Eugenia and received six award nominations. The movie received a number of lukewarm reviews as a somewhat over-literary adaptation. Critic Chris Elliot noted the movie's \\"opaque refinements and elusive intentions, a predilection for intricacies of language and manners.\\" Roger Ebert similarly demurred that the movie was \\"a classroom version of James, a film with no juice or life of its own.\\" References   External links  Original magazine text of The Europeans (1878) *First American book version of The Europeans (1878) *Note on the various versions of The Europeans at the Library of America web site * Category:1878 British novels Category:1878 American novels Category:Novels by Henry James Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Works originally published in The Atlantic (magazine) Category:Macmillan Publishers books Category:American novels adapted into films Category:British novels adapted into films eu:Europarrak (eleberria) ","title":"The Europeans"},{"id":"2428309","text":"Gormanston is a town in Tasmania on the slopes of Mount Owen, above the town of Queenstown in Tasmania's West Coast.

Mount Lyell Post Office opened on 1 January 1891, was renamed Gormanston in 1894 and closed in 1979. It is the only remaining townsite that lies in effect 'in' the West Coast Range. It was a major settlement of employees of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company, especially of those who were employed at parts of its workings that were located in the North Lyell and open cut areas. At the peak of its population and importance, Gormanston had its own local government authority, of which mine manager R. M. Murray was the long-standing Warden. The company also had a daily bus to take workers down to the mine and plant in Queenstown. It was the nearest community to the 1912 North Mount Lyell Disaster and was used as a base by company officials attending to this disaster.* (Available at Galley Museum Queenstown) Considerable numbers of buildings have been removed to other locations, and the local government authority was absorbed into the new 'West Coast Council' and the adjacent Mount Lyell workings have been closed down. It is the closest settlement to Lake Burbury, a hydro created lake from the damming of the King River. There are currently no other settlement or other buildings on the Lyell Highway towards Hobart until Derwent Bridge. There are booklets available in the Galley Museum in Queenstown, that give historical information about the town in its heyday, and in particular lists of registered inhabitants in the early 1900s.

A potentiostat is the electronic hardware required to control a three electrode cell and run most electroanalytical experiments.

The system functions by maintaining the potential of the working electrode at a constant level with respect to the reference electrode by adjusting the current at an auxiliary electrode. It consists of an electric circuit which is usually described in terms of simple op amps.  Primary use  This equipment is fundamental to modern electrochemical studies using three electrode systems for investigations of reaction mechanisms related to redox chemistry and other chemical phenomena. The dimensions of the resulting data depend on the experiment. In voltammetry, electric current in amps is plotted against electric potential in voltage. In a bulk electrolysis total coulombs passed (total electric charge) is plotted against time in seconds even though the experiment measures electric current (amperes) over time. This is done to show that the experiment is approaching an expected number of coulombs. Most early potentiostats could function independently, providing data output through a physical data trace. Modern potentiostats are designed to interface with a personal computer and operate through a dedicated software package. The automated software allows the user rapidly to shift between experiments and experimental conditions. The computer allows data to be stored and analyzed more effectively, rapidly, and accurately than historic methods.  Basic relationships  A potentiostat is a control and measuring device. It comprises an electric circuit which controls the potential across the cell by sensing changes in its resistance, varying accordingly the current supplied to the system: a higher resistance will result in a decreased current, while a lower resistance will result in an increased current, in order to keep the voltage constant as described by Ohm's law. :{R} = {E \\\\over I} As a result, the variable system resistance and the controlled current are inversely proportional :I_o={E_c \\\\over R_v} :*I_o is the output electric current of the potentiostat :*E_c is the voltage that is kept constant :*R_v is the electrical resistance that varies.  Principles of operation  Since 1942, when Hickling built the first three electrode potentiostat, substantial progress has been made to improve the instrument. Hickling's device used a third electrode, the reference electrode to control the cell potential automatically. Up until the present day his principle has remained in use. At a glance, a potentiostat measures the potential difference between the working and the reference electrode, applies the current through the counter electrode and measures the current as an i R voltage drop over a series resistor ( R_{\\\\textrm m} in Fig. 1). The control amplifier (CA) is responsible for maintaining the voltage between the reference and the working electrode as closely as possible to the voltage of the input source E_{\\\\textrm i} . It adjusts its output to automatically control the cell current so that a condition of equilibrium is satisfied. The theory of operation is best understood using the equations below. Prior to observing the following equations, one may note that, from an electrical point of view, the electrochemical cell and the current measurement resistor R_{\\\\textrm m} may be regarded as two impedances (Fig. 2). Z_1 includes R_{\\\\textrm m} in series with the interfacial impedance of the counter electrode and the solution resistance between the counter and the reference. Z_2 represents the interfacial impedance of the working electrode in series with the solution resistance between the working and the reference electrodes. Fig. 2 : Schematic of a potentiostat, with electrochemical cell replaced by two impedances. The role of the control amplifier is to amplify the potential difference between the positive (or noninverting) input and the negative (or inverting) input. This may be translated mathematically into the following equation: : E_{\\\\textrm{out}}=A\\\\,(E^+-E^-)=A\\\\,(E_{\\\\textrm i}-E_{\\\\textrm r}) . (1) where A is the amplification factor of the CA. At this point the assumption may be made that a negligible amount of current is flowing through the reference electrode. This correlates to physical phenomenon since the reference electrode is connected to a high impedance electrometer. Thus, the cell current may be described in two ways: : I_{\\\\textrm c}=\\\\frac{E_{\\\\textrm{out}}}{Z_1+Z_2} (2) and : I_{\\\\textrm c}=\\\\frac{E_{\\\\textrm r}}{Z_2} . (3) Combining Eqs. (2) and (3) yields Eq. (4): : E_{\\\\textrm r}=\\\\frac{Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2}\\\\,E_{\\\\textrm{out}}=\\\\beta\\\\,E_{\\\\textrm{out}} (4) where \\\\beta is the fraction of the output voltage of the control amplifier returned to its negative input; namely the feedback factor: : \\\\beta=\\\\frac{Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2} . Combining Eqs. (1) and (4) yields Eq. (6): : \\\\frac{E_{\\\\textrm r}}{E_{\\\\textrm i}}=\\\\frac{\\\\beta\\\\,A}{1+\\\\beta\\\\,A} . (6) When the quantity \\\\beta A becomes very large with respect to one, Eq. (6) reduces to Eq. (7), which is one of the negative feedback equations: : E_{\\\\textrm i}=E_{\\\\textrm r} . (7) Eq. (7) proves that the control amplifier works to keep the voltage between the reference and the working close to the input source voltage.  Software control  Replacing the CA, a control algorithm can maintain a constant voltage E_{\\\\textrm c} between the reference electrode and the working electrode. This algorithm is based on the rule of proportion: : \\\\frac{U_{\\\\textrm m}}{E_{\\\\textrm c}} = \\\\frac{U_{\\\\textrm n}}{E_{\\\\textrm {SP}}} . (8) :*U_{\\\\textrm m} is the last measured cell voltage between the working electrode (WE) and the counter electrode (CE). :*E_{\\\\textrm c} is the last measured electrochemical potential, i.e. the voltage between the reference electrode and WE to be kept constant. :*U_{\\\\textrm n} is the next cell voltage to be set, i.e. the controller output. :*E_{\\\\textrm {SP}} is the setpoint, i.e. the desired E_{\\\\textrm c}. If the measurement intervals of Eq. (8) are kept constant, the control algorithm sets the cell voltage U_{\\\\textrm m} so to keep E_{\\\\textrm c} as close as possible to the setpoint E_{\\\\textrm {SP}}. The algorithm requires software-controllable hardware such as a digital multimeter, a power supply, and a double-pole double-throw relay. The relay is necessary to switch polarity.  Significant features  In electrochemical experiments the electrodes are the pieces of equipment that comes in immediate contact with the analyte. For this reason the electrodes are very important for determining the experimental result. The electrode surface may or may not catalyze chemical reactions. The size of the electrodes affects the magnitude of the currents passed which can affect signal to noise. But electrodes are not the only limiting factor for electrochemical experiments, the potentiostat also has a limited range of operation. The following are a few significant features that vary between instruments. *Electric potential range (measured and applied): while the potential window is mostly based on the solvent window the electronics can also limit the possible range. *Accuracy in potential (measured and applied): limits of deviations between the actual and reported. *Range of scan rate: how slow or fast a potential window can be scanned this is most important for experiments that require high scan rates such as those involving ultramicroelectrodes. *Sample rate: the rate at which potential or voltage can be accurately sampled. This can be important for experiments that need high scan rates such as those involving ultramicroelectrodes. *File size: a limiting factor can be the file size limit. This would most likely affect the choice of the potential range swept or the potential sample rate. *Electric current range (measured and applied): the maximum range over which current can be sampled. Applying large currents is important for experiments that pass a great deal of current like a large bulk electrolysis. Measuring small currents is important for experiments that pass small currents like those involving ultramicroelectrodes. *Current resolution: determines the operational range of a specific experiment and the bit resolution of that data in the current dimension. *Accuracy in current (measured and applied): limits of deviations between the actual and reported. *Number of working channels: how many working electrodes can the instrument control. A bipotentiostat is necessary to controlling systems with two working electrodes like a rotating ring-disk electrode. A polypotentiostat may be important for controlling some biological experiments with three or more working electrodes. *Footprint: potentiostats include small devices of about 20 x 10 x 5 cm weighing well under a kilogram or a simple board that can be installed in a desktop computer. A large bench-top model would be on the order of 50 x 20 x 10 cm and weigh up to or more than 5 kilograms. *Interface: can the instrument run independently or must they be slaved to a personal computer. *Sweep generator: can the system apply an analogue sweep or does it use a digital staircase generator as an approximation. If it does use a digital staircase then the resolution of the staircase is important. *Rotating electrode: can the instrument operate a rotating electrode. This is intrinsic for experiments that require a rotating disk electrode or rotating ring-disk electrode.

He played in 374 Eredivisie matches in a 20-year professional career, in representation of three clubs. Playing career Born in Eindhoven, Noord- Brabant, Lodewijks started his professional career with local PSV Eindhoven, but was never able to dislodge legendary Hans van Breukelen during his two- year spell. He made his Eredivisie debut on 23 April 1988 in a 2‚Äì0 away win against FC Groningen, and then played nine solid seasons at precisely that club, which never lost its top flight status. Lodewijks in training with Feyenoord Lodewijks' performances earned him a PSV return, but he again would only play second-fiddle, now to Ronald Waterreus, appearing very rarely over four years. He signed in 2002 with Feyenoord, playing his first game on 3 November in another 2‚Äì0 success at Groningen. =Controversy= In a December 2003 match against FC Twente (2‚Äì4 away defeat), Lodewijks was angered by referee Ben Haverkort's decision to award a penalty kick against the visitors. After the final whistle he sarcastically handed the ball to the official, who responded by repeatedly showing the player his tongue. Coaching career After the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season and the appointment of Bert van Marwijk as new manager, Lodewijks finished his career at the age of 40 and replaced Pim Doesburg as goalkeeping coach of the Rotterdam side. This decision was helped by a knee injury which forced a surgery on the meniscus and left him on the sidelines for a long time. Lodewijks continued working in that capacity in the following years, with former club Groningen and the Netherlands national team. In June 2016, he joined compatriot Ronald Koeman at Premier League's Everton.

Small bean bags are tossed and juggled in a game similar to jacks. Although it is generally a social game, Otedama can also be played alone. It is rarely competitive and often accompanied by singing. Otedama play is thought to be in decline. History Otedama was transmitted to Japan from China in the Nara Period. It reached its peak of popularity in post-World War II Japan when other toys were unavailable. The bean bags, called ojami, were sewn together from strips of silk cloth and contained azuki beans. During war times, the beans were removed from the bags to feed children; as a result, there were almost no bean bags left in Japan. Otedama almost completely vanished from Japan because of this. In the early 1990s, a small group of people in Niihama created a club and annual convention to help restore otedama throughout Japan. Basic Game Otedama was madly popular among girls and knowledge of the game was passed down from grandmother to granddaughter. Specific game play varies widely from region to region. Most play with five bean bags although some variations have been seen. Players take turns throwing and catching the bean bags. Each successive round increases in difficulty with balancing tricks and even juggling. Otedama has two basic forms: nagedama (Êäï„ÅíÁéâ) and yosedama („Çà„ÅõÁéâ). Nagedama resembles western juggling with small bean bags. Yosedama is more akin to jacks but bean bags are used instead of jacks. References *Onishi, Denishiro (2003).

Its task is to collect, permanently archive, comprehensively document and record bibliographically all German and German-language publications since 1913, foreign publications about Germany, translations of German works, and the works of German-speaking emigrants published abroad between 1933 and 1945, and to make them available to the public. The German National Library maintains co-operative external relations on a national and international level. For example, it is the leading partner in developing and maintaining bibliographic rules and standards in Germany and plays a significant role in the development of international library standards. The cooperation with publishers has been regulated by law since 1935 for the Deutsche B√ºcherei Leipzig and since 1969 for the Deutsche Bibliothek Frankfurt. Duties are shared between the facilities in Leipzig and Frankfurt, with each center focusing its work in specific specialty areas. A third facility has been the Deutsches Musikarchiv Berlin (founded 1970), which deals with all music-related archiving (both printed and recorded materials). Since 2010 the Deutsches Musikarchiv is also located in Leipzig as an integral part of the facility there.  History  During the German revolutions of 1848 various booksellers and publishers offered their works to the Frankfurt Parliament for a parliamentary library. The library, led by Johann Heinrich Plath, was termed the Reichsbibliothek (\\"Reich library\\"). After the failure of the revolution the library was abandoned and the stock of books already in existence was stored at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg. In 1912, the town of Leipzig, seat of the annual Leipzig Book Fair, the Kingdom of Saxony and the B√∂rsenverein der Deutschen Buchh√§ndler (Association of German booksellers) agreed to found a German National Library in Leipzig. Starting January 1, 1913, all publications in German were systematically collected (including books from Austria and Switzerland). In the same year, Dr. Gustav Wahl was elected as the first director. In 1946 Dr. Georg Kurt Schauer, Heinrich Cobet, Vittorio Klostermann and Professor Hanns Wilhelm Eppelsheimer, director of the Frankfurt University Library, initiated the re-establishment of a German archive library based in Frankfurt. The Federal state representatives of the book trade in the American zone agreed to the proposal. The city of Frankfurt agreed to support the planned archive library with personnel and financial resources. The US military government gave its approval. The Library began its work in the tobacco room of the former Rothschild library, which served the bombed university library as accommodation. As a result, there were two libraries in Germany, which assumed the duties and function of a national library for the later GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany, respectively. Two national bibliographic catalogues almost identical in content were published annually. With the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, the Deutsche B√ºcherei Leipzig and the Deutsche Bibliothek Frankfurt am Main were merged into a new institution, The German Library (Die Deutsche Bibliothek). The \\"Law regarding the German National Library\\" came into force on 29 June 2006. The expansion of the collection brief to include online publications set the course for collecting, cataloguing and storing such publications as part of Germany's cultural heritage. The Library's highest management body, the Administrative Council, was expanded to include two MPs from the Bundestag. The law also changed the name of the library and its buildings in Leipzig, Frankfurt am Main and Berlin to \\"Deutsche Nationalbibliothek\\" (German National Library). In July 2000, the DMA also assumed the role as repository for GEMA, Gesellschaft f√ºr musikalische Auff√ºhrungs- und mechanische Vervielf√§ltigungsrechte, a German music copyright organization. Since then, music publishers only have to submit copies to DMA, which covers both national archiving and copyright registration. The 210,000 works of printed music previously held by GEMA were transferred to DMA.  German Exile Archive and controversy  One of the special activities of the German National Library involves the collection and processing of printed and non-printed documents of German-speaking emigrants and exiles during the period from 1933 to 1945. The German National Library maintains two exile collections: the Collection of Exile Literature 1933‚Äì1945 of the German National Library in Leipzig and the German Exile Archive 1933‚Äì1945 of the German National Library in Frankfurt am Main. Both collections contain printed works written or published abroad by German-speaking emigrants as well as leaflets, brochures and other materials produced entirely or in part by German-speaking exiles. In 1998 the German National Library and the German Research Foundation began a publicly funded project to digitise the ‚ÄúJewish Periodicals in Nazi Germany‚Äù collection of approximately 30,000 pages, which were originally published between 1933 and 1943. Additionally included in the project were 30 German-language emigrant publications \\"German-language exile journals 1933‚Äì1945\\", consisting of around 100,000 pages. These collections were put online in 2004 and were some of the most frequently visited sites of the German National Library. In June 2012 the German National Library discontinued access to both collections on its website for legal reasons. The digitised versions are since then available for use in the reading rooms of the German National Library in Leipzig and Frankfurt am Main only, which caused partly harsh criticism.haGalil, 16. July 2012, ‚ÄúDeutsche Nationalbibliothek blendet j√ºdische Geschichte aus‚Äù (‚ÄúGerman National Library blinds out Jewish History‚Äù), by Jim G.

The Jewish German-language newspaper haGalil called the libraries action \\"overzealous.\\" Yves Kugelmann, the head of J√ºdische Medien AG in Z√ºrich, which owns the rights to Aufbau magazine, one of the Exile Archive's offerings, called the action ‚Äúcompletely absurd, confusing, and without merit.‚Äù Dr. Anne Lipp of the German Research Foundation concluded that \\"all projects of the foundation,‚Äù which have been paid for by public funding and with the intent of publishing online, ‚Äúmust be made public.‚ÄùhaGalil, 19.

Tobias (in German) Dr. Asmus, head of Deutsches Exilarchiv, claims that the ownership of articles from over 13,000 individual authors must first be confirmed and permissions obtained before the 70- to 80-year-old articles may be put online again, despite having had permission from the rightful owners of the publications to put the articles online. Asmus admits that there was not one single complaint of copyright violation.Comments in a speech given by Asmus on 29 November 2013 in the Jewish Museum, Berlin for the Zugang Gestalten! conference. Meanwhile, other German and international institutions such as Compact Memory, the Leo Baeck Institute and Archive.org have no such compunctions and have begun restoring many of the deleted periodicals to the internet again.  German Music Archive  The Deutsches Musikarchiv (DMA, German Music Archive) is the central collection of printed and recorded music and the music-bibliographic information centre for Germany. It is a Federal agency founded in 1970, tasked with collecting all music published in the country. Its precursor was the Deutsche Musik-Phonothek (1961‚Äì1969). The DMA moved to Leipzig in 2010, to be housed in an extension of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek. Construction work began in 2006 and was completed in 2009. Formerly situated in Berlin-Lankwitz, the DMA constitutes a department of the German National Library (Deutsche Nationalbibliothek). Publishers of printed and recorded music in Germany are required by law (since 1973) to deliver two copies of every edition to the archive. One copy is kept at the DMA in Leipzig, the second is deposited in Frankfurt.  Building in Leipzig  :Coordinates: The original building of the German National Library in Leipzig from 1914 The main building of the German National Library in Leipzig was built 1914‚Äì1916 after plans of the architect Oskar Pusch. The impressive facade is 160 m long and faces the \\"Deutscher Platz\\" (German Plaza). The building was opened on October 19, 1916. The site of the library had been donated by the city of Leipzig, while Friedrich August III, King of Saxony provided the funds for the building. On the facade, the portraits of Otto von Bismarck, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johannes Gutenberg are displayed. Statues represent Technology, Justice, Philosophy, Medicine etc. The central reading room contains a picture by Ludwig von Hofmann, depicting Arcadia in Art Nouveau-style. The staircase displays a mural showing the founders of the German library. The Library also contains the German Museum of Books and Writing.

Its location provides unobstructed views of the city of Belfast and Belfast Lough. History Built by the Normans in the 12th Century, the original Belfast Castle probably sat within what later became the City of Belfast itself. In 1611, Sir Arthur Chichester (later created Baron Chichester) replaced the old castle with one made of stone and timber, building on the same spot as the original castle. In 1708, Sir Arthur's castle burned down. Because the castle's location was changed, the original site was turned into streets named in honour of the previous castles. Rather than rebuilding on the same site, a new castle was eventually built on Cave Hill (north of Belfast) for The 3rd Marquess of Donegall, with construction starting in 1862 and not ending until 1870. Architect Sir Charles Lanyon designed the new building in the then- popular Scottish baronial style. Construction cost well over the ‚Ç§11,000 set aside to pay for the project. Lord Donegall's son-in-law, Lord Ashley (who later became The 8th Earl of Shaftesbury), paid for the reconstruction and later inherited the castle, in October 1883. Lord Shaftesbury, his wife, Harriet Augusta, and their ancestors are honoured and remembered in the form of Belfast street names, much like how the original castles are remembered. The Shaftesbury family were not only the castle's residents and owners, but they were also generous donors to the City of Belfast and hosted events at their home. The 9th Earl of Shaftesbury even became Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1907. The castle remained a private estate until the entire property was gifted to the city in January 1934, the process of which became a topic of public interest in the years prior to the official presentation to the city. In the years after it was given to the city, there was some debate about what the castle should be used for. The publicity manager that the castle should either be re-purposed into a tea and dance room, or perhaps a museum and art gallery with refreshment rooms. The castle was just the beginning. The publicity manager also made plans for the grounds to include an open-air theatre, clay pigeon shooting, archery, tennis courts, bowling greens, squash courts, and mini golf. With such an ambitious project, a sub-committee estimated that the minimum possible cost would be ‚Ç§160,000 before considering the cost of employing grounds keepers and the cost of restoring the building. Since 1945, the castle has been a popular venue for weddings, afternoon teas, and other such events.  Location  Belfast Castle is located 400 feet (121.92 meters) above sea level on Cave Hill overlooking Belfast, County Antrim, Northern Ireland.  Facilities  Belfast Castle is open to the public daily with a visitor center, antique shop, restaurant, and a playground. Visitors can see a bedroom, set up in the style of the 1920s so visitors can see a snapshot in time of what the castle looked like at the end of its life as a private estate. Belfast Castle Stairs While it is open to the public daily, reservations can be made for a private room to host weddings, business meetings, and parties.  Structure  Since its construction in the 1860s, the castle's sandstone walls and towers have been restored. The castle is built in the Scottish baronial style, which was born out of rising Gothic styles in the 16th Century as part of the Scottish Renaissance. Scottish baronial style castles were typically built on asymmetrical plans and included high roofs, towers, and turrets to display the owner's status. One of the castle's most iconic features is the winding staircase at the entrance, whose greyish-brown color stands out against the burnt sienna sandstone and brick red detail. As in the 20th Century, many of the rooms have been turned into public tea rooms or are available to be reserved for private functions.  Restoration  After years of successful business and popularity, the castle was closed in 1978 for a refurbishing effort. The architecture partnership of Hewitt and Haslam oversaw and carried out the over ‚Ç§2 million project, with the estate reopening on 11 November 1988. Since then, it has once again become a popular spot for weddings and other celebrations as well as for business meetings. Another example of events held at the castle is the 2015 Belfast Castle Hospice walk, held by Northern Ireland Hospice to benefit local charities and those living with terminal illnesses. The castle underwent another round of refurbishment in May 2003.

She was the second wife of Emperor Jing and the mother of Emperor Wu.  Family background and first marriage  Wang Zhi was born in 173 BC to Wang Zhong (Áéã‰ª≤) and Zang Er (ËáßÂÖí), who was a granddaughter of Zang Tu, the one-time King of Yan appointed by Xiang Yu until the fifth year of Emperor Gaozu. Zang Tu rebelled against the Emperor and was defeated. He and his entire family was massacred. Zang Er, who was married to Wang Zhong, was Zang Tu's granddaughter.http://news.sina.com.tw/books/history/barticle/6496.html Wang Zhi's parents had, in addition to her, an older son, Wang Xin (Áéã‰ø°) and a younger daughter, Wang Erxu (ÁéãÂÖíÂßÅ). They lived in Huaili (ÊßêÈáå, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). After her father died, her mother remarried a man named Tian (Áî∞), and had two more sons, Tian Fen (Áî∞Ëö°) and Tian Sheng (Áî∞Âãù). When Wang Zhi was young, she was married to a local man named Jin Wangsun (ÈáëÁéãÂ≠´), and had a daughter named Jin Su (Èáë‰øó). However, her mother was told by a soothsayer that both of her daughters would become extremely honoured. Zang Er decided to offer her daughters to the crown prince, Liu Qi, and, to do so, forcibly divorced Wang Zhi from her husband. Wang Zhi was then sent along with her sister, Wang Erxu, to Crown Prince's palace to join his concubinage.  As consort to the crown prince and then emperor  After being offered to the Crown Prince, both Wang Zhi and Wang Erxu became favoured. She then bore him three daughters, Grand Princess Yangxin (ÈôΩ‰ø°Èï∑ÂÖ¨‰∏ª), Princess Nangong (ÂçóÂÆÆÂÖ¨‰∏ª) and Princess Longl√º (ÈöÜÊÖÆÂÖ¨‰∏ª), and later a son named Liu Che (ÂäâÂæπ) who was born in 157 BC, on the day Liu Qi ascended to the throne as Emperor Jing of Han, whilst her sister bore him four sons, Liu Yue, Prince Hui of Guangchuan (Âª£Â∑ùÊÉ†Áéã ÂäâË∂ä), Liu Ji, Prince Kang of Jiaodong (ËÜ†Êù±Â∫∑Áéã ÂäâÂØÑ), Liu Cheng, Prince Ai of Qinghe (Ê∏ÖÊ≤≥ÂìÄÁéã Âäâ‰πò), and Liu Shun, Prince Xian of Changshan (Â∏∏Â±±ÊÜ≤Áéã ÂäâËàú). When Wang Zhi was pregnant with Liu Che, she claimed that she dreamed that the sun had fallen into her womb. Emperor Jing was ecstatic over the divine implication, and made Liu Che (his 10th son) the Prince of Jiaodong (ËÜ†Êù±Áéã) in 153 BC. Wang Zhi was also promoted to a consort for giving birth to a royal prince. Emperor Jing's formal wife, Empress Bo, was childless. As a result, Emperor Jing's oldest son Liu Rong (ÂäâÊ¶Æ), born of the Emperor's other favourite concubine, Lady Li (Ê†óÂß¨), was created crown prince in 153 BC. Lady Li, feeling certain that her son would become the emperor, grew arrogant and intolerant, and frequently threw tantrums at Emperor Jing out of jealousy over his favouring other concubines. Her lack of tact would prove to be Consort Wang's chance. When Emperor Jing's older sister, Eldest Princess Guantao (È§®Èô∂Èï∑ÂÖ¨‰∏ª) Liu Piao (ÂäâÂ´ñ), offered to marry her daughter Chen Jiao (Èô≥Â¨å) to Liu Rong, Lady Li rudely rejected the proposal complaining that Princess Guantao often offered new concubines as prostitutes and encouraged Emperor Jing not to favour Lady Li. Consort Wang, who had been observing quietly and waiting for her chance, took the opportunity and secured a marriage alliance by offering to marry her 5-year-old son Liu Che. Now siding with Consort Wang, Princess Guantao constantly criticised Lady Li in front of Emperor Jing. Gradually accepting his sister's concerns, Emperor Jing decided to test out Lady Li. One day he asked Lady Li that whether she would happily look after and properly raise the rest of his children if he was to pass away, only to have Lady Li rudely (and foolishly) refuse to comply. This made Emperor Jing angry and he became worried that if Liu Rong was to inherit the throne and Lady Li became Empress Dowager, many of his concubines might suffer the fate of Consort Qi. Seizing the opportunity, Consort Wang put in place the final straw against Lady Li. She persuaded a minister to advise Emperor Jing to make Lady Li empress as Liu Rong was already the crown prince. Emperor Jing, already of the view that Lady Li must not be made empress, was enraged and believed that Lady Li had conspired with government officials. He executed that minister who put forward that proposal, and demoted Liu Rong to the Prince of Linjiang (Ëá®Ê±üÁéã) in 150 BC and exiled him out of the capital city Chang'an. Lady Li was stripped of her titles and placed under house arrest, and died of frustration and depression not long after. Since Empress Bo's deposition one year earlier, the position of empress was open. Emperor Jing, who had always considered Liu Che to be his favourite son, soon made Consort Wang empress. Liu Che, now legally the oldest son of the Empress, was later made crown prince.  As empress  Remembering the lesson of Empress Bo's and Lady Li's fate, despite her honoured position as empress, Empress Wang did not try to assert as much influence on her husband as her mother-in-law, Empress Dowager Dou, had asserted over her father-in-law, Emperor Wen. She had good relations with her mother-in-law, and both she and her brother Wang Xin played important parts in calming Emperor Jing over his anger against his younger brother Liu Wu (ÂäâÊ≠¶), the Prince Xiao of Liang, and the favoured young son of Empress Dowager Dou, when Liu Wu assassinated a number of court officials in 148 BC for opposing the proposal to have him appointed the heir apparent. It was because of this that Empress Dowager Dou wanted to create Wang Xin a marquess, a move initially blocked by his prime minister, Zhou Yafu (Âë®‰∫ûÂ§´), although Emperor Jing eventually carried out the promotion of Wang Xin. She was probably pleased when Zhou Yafu committed suicide in 143 BC after being falsely accused of treason and arrested. When Emperor Jing died in 141 BC, Crown Prince Che succeeded to the throne as Emperor Wu, and Empress Wang became empress dowager.  As empress dowager  After Empress Wang became empress dowager, her son carried out several immediate acts to honour her family members. Her mother was created the Lady of Pingyuan, and her half- brothers were created marquesses. Her daughter Jin Su, from her previous marriage, was tracked down and personally visited by Emperor Wu, and he created her the Lady of Xiucheng (‰øÆÊàêÂêõ). She was awarded 300 servants, 100 acres of land, and a grand mansion. Jin Su's daughter was married to a prince. Empress Dowager Wang exerted significant influence on her son. For example, with her approval, her half-brother Tian Fen became the commander of the armed forces and exerted power even beyond the military affairs. Initially, her influence was balanced and outweighed by that of her mother-in-law, Grand Empress Dowager Dou. With Grand Empress Dowager Dou's death in 135 BC, Empress Dowager Wang became the paramount figure at court, and in 135 BC Tian Fen was made prime minister, although her son gradually justified this position as he matured. For example, in 133 BC, in the aftermath of the failed attempt to capture the Xiongnu Chanyu at the Battle of Mayi, Emperor Wu wanted to execute the key strategist, Wang Hui (ÁéãÊÅ¢, unrelated to her), who bribed Tian, who in turn persuaded her to speak on Wang Hui's behalf. Emperor Wu refused to accept her intercession, and forced Wang Hui to commit suicide. However, it was at her behest that Emperor Wu executed his grand uncle Dou Ying (Á´áÂ¨∞) (Empress Dou's cousin) in 132 BC for having insulted Tian. Mound of Empress Wang Zhi's tomb in Han Yang Ling Empress Dowager Wang died in 126 BC, and was buried with her second husband Emperor Jing.

It is also locally called \\"The Big Meeting\\" or \\"Durham Big Meeting\\". In the context of the Durham Miners' Gala, \\"gala\\" is usually pronounced rather than the more common pronunciation . Its highlight consists of a parade of banners, each typically accompanied by a brass band, which are marched to the old Racecourse, where political speeches are delivered. In the afternoon a miners' service is held in Durham Cathedral, which may include the blessing of any new banners. The 2020 Gala has been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.  History ‚Äì out of unionism  The gala developed out of the miners' trade unionism, the first union being established in 1869.Your View 22 ‚Äì Moving on seamlessly The Durham Miners' Association organised the first gala, which was held in 1871 in Wharton Park, Durham. It developed into the largest unofficial miners and trade-union gathering in the United Kingdom. At its peak the gala attracted more than 300,000 people ‚Äì more than seven times the population of Durham itself. Banners would traditionally be taken on foot from its particular colliery into Durham and the event was marked by large unions of men marching on the roads leading into the city. The socialist, and often communist, nature of the miners' unionism found expression in the gala. In particular, the banners contain several images of notable socialist and communist figures and captions capture similar sentiments. The gala was cancelled from 1915 to 1918 (because of the First World War), 1921, 1922 and 1926 (all because of strikes) and again from 1940 to 1945 because of the Second World War. In 1926 however the gala was held outside of Durham city, organised by miners in the village of Burnhope some 7 miles to the north of Durham itself, this marks the first and only time the gala has been held in some place other than the city. 40,000 miners from across the county marched up the hill to the village to be addressed by General Secretary of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain A. J. Cook. The effect of the 1984‚Äì85 miners' strike, which saw miners across the Durham Coalfield strike, also led to the gala being called off in 1984. The closure of collieries in County Durham, particularly after the Second World War, reduced the numbers attending the gala. Nonetheless, even if a colliery was closed the banner was often still marched. In 2020, the Durham Miners Association cancelled the event due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. The centenary gala was held in 1983.  The banners  Most banners represent lodges of the National Union of Mineworkers in the Durham Area. However other unions have also been represented, particularly in recent years, as well as union banners from other parts of the UK, including NUM lodges of the Yorkshire branch and South Wales. They are made of silk, are rectangular and hang from a cross member, from which guide ropes are held by those carrying it.Durham Miner Project ‚Äì Banners of Durham Miners' Union 1869 to the present Traditionally banners were draped in black cloth when there had been a death in the pit during the previous year. More recently following the closure of pits across the county they are draped with black cloth on significant anniversaries of disasters at the colliery they represent. Many banners contain explicit socialist or communist references, having renderings of Marx, Lenin, and other prominent figures such as miners' leaders, or politicians. Chopwell, often referred to as \\"Little Moscow\\",Roy Lambeth's Durham Miners Gala Banner Photographs. 1983 has the only banner (the 1955 version) that contains images of both Marx and Lenin (as well as the hammer and sickle). The 1935 Chopwell banner toured the Soviet Union and is thought to reside somewhere in Moscow today. Socialist expressions also take the form of captions‚Äîfor example, \\"Socialism through evolution\\" and \\"Need before greed\\" (on Blackhall Lodge's banner). Christian themes having a socialist resonance also figure on some banners. Three successive banners of Lumley Lodge (1929, 1960, 2005) have depicted the \\"Lion and Lamb\\" and \\"Turning Swords into Ploughshares\\" images from the book of Isaiah on either side, uniquely the only all biblical banners in the Durham coalfield. More recently, residents in former pit villages have taken it upon themselves to restore, or even create, banners. This has involved the reintegration of collieries that had left the gala. Some banners, such as Spennymoor's, represent a group of former local collieries rather than individual ones. These have received funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.Durham Miners Gala ‚Äì Heritage Lottery Fund  Gala today  No deep mines remain in the Durham Coalfield, compared to over a hundred at the coalfield's peak. Despite this, the gala continues to be organised. The 122nd gala, held in 2006, attracted over 50,000 people, and approximately 100,000 attended in 2009,Durham Miners' Gala 2009 BBC.co.uk making it one of the biggest political gatherings in Europe. During the morning banners are still marched to the racecourse with its tradition of speeches (recent notable speakers have included Tony Benn, Billy Bragg and Ken Livingstone) then in the afternoon to the cathedral. In 2012 Labour Party leader Ed Miliband addressed the 128th gala; he was the first Labour Party leader to speak at the gala for 23 years, the last one being Neil Kinnock in 1989. He praised the event as \\"a great North East tradition\\" and attacked the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, saying it had \\"lost a generation of young people\\". In 2015, all four candidates in the Labour leadership election appeared at the gala, but only Jeremy Corbyn, who had already secured the endorsement of the Durham Miners' Association, was asked to give a speech to the gala. After winning the leadership contest, Corbyn addressed the event as Labour leader every year from 2016 to 2019. In September 2019, a feature-length documentary about the gala was released. The Big Meeting screened across the UK and received a host of positive national reviews, including a four-star review from Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, in which he described the film as a \\"rich, heartfelt and intimate tribute to the Durham Miners‚Äô Gala.\\" Panorama beside the River Wear in 2014  References   Further reading  *  External links  * Friends of the Durham Miners' Gala * Durham Mining Museum * Photographs of 1970s, (and now 2012, 2013 & 2014), Durham Miners' Banners by Peter Loud = Videos = *Spennymoor banner in 2006 *Bowburn banner in 2007 * A slideshow tribute to the collieries of County Durham, including Dawdon, Murton, Seaham and Sunderland pits: *Durham Miners' Gala 2009 *NASUWT banner in 2010 *Durham Miners' Gala July 2011 *Murton Band in 2004 Category:British trade unions history Category:Miners' labor movement Category:Mining in County Durham Category:National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain) Category:Labour festivals Category:Durham, England Category:1871 establishments in England Category:Recurring events established in 1871 Category:Political events in the United Kingdom Category:Festivals established in 1871 Category:Socialism in England ","title":"Durham Miners' Gala"},{"id":"2428383","text":"A PIND test is a Particle Impact Noise Detection test.

It was the first game created by Liquid Entertainment. An expansion pack Battle Realms: Winter of the Wolf was released in November 2002. In 2012, the game was re-released on GOG.com. In 2019, the game was re-released on Steam as Battle Realms: Zen Edition, in its early access state with functioning online multiplayer. Gameplay The clan's allies are in combat destroying the other clans' opposition. Battle Realms' gameplay is like many other real-time strategy games. There are several factions which all have various types of available structures and units to produce. Unlike other real-time strategy games though, the basic worker units (peasants), which are used for resource gathering and construction, also act as the base unit to be upgraded into military units. Thus, military buildings in Battle Realms are used for transforming and upgrading units rather than producing them directly. Another unusual trait is unit generation, where peasants are produced automatically at no cost. The rate at which new peasants are produced is inversely proportionate to the current population of the player's army. Peasants gather three resources in the game: rice, water and horses. Horses are war units that can be used to combine with other military units i.e. riding or can be turned into pack horses when assigned for peasants. Only one type of builder unit is required. Peasants are the only units that can be produced outright. Most of the buildings available are training structures where peasants are trained to become other units. All factions start off with three basic training structures which produce units along different paths of warfare, such as melee or ranged combat. In most cases, units can be trained in three different structures to produce more highly skilled infantry or Battle Gears (commonly abbreviated as BGs) to improve their combat ability. This allows lower tiered units to defeat higher tier units, which they could not normally defeat. BGs also allow the player to further define the role of a unit, such as damage absorption, building destruction, or reconnaissance. Another key element of Battle Realms is the Yin/Yang system. Each army obtains points of Yin or Yang when in combat, depending on their moral alliance to the forces of light or darkness. Hero units, or Zen Masters, require Yin/Yang to be summoned and increase their damage. Yin and Yang are also used by structures in the faction's base for military upgrades. The rate of Yin/Yang growth depends on the strength and flair of the army and how far they are from the main base. =Factions= There are four available factions, called clans in Battle Realms, and each has a different philosophy towards life and combat: * The Dragon clan is a race of warriors who favor honorable and valorous combat. * The Wolf clan is a race of formerly enslaved miners. Their clan members live basic, healthy lives, and their culture emphasizes strong ties to nature. Their former enslavement allowed them to develop armor made from the shale they used to mine. * The Serpent clan is the remnant of the old Dragon clan which uses stealth, trickery, and brutality to further its goals. Unlike their predecessors, they have mastered weapon technology to a certain extent (especially gunpowder) and has also dabbled into Necromancy. This is the original and dominant clan before the fall of The Serpent himself. * The Lotus clan is an ancient group of sorcerers that delves deeply into the corrupting aspects of magic. They were also the clan that enslaved the Wolf clan and used to serve the Serpent clan. Unlike most strategy games, all units in Battle Realms have a melee attack, however, missile units typically have drastically weaker melee attacks. Units are very detailed and have distinct fighting animations. Units can dodge projectiles if they run fast enough, and projectiles have different speeds and fire at certain angles. A unit's attack has a property - either cutting, piercing, blunt, explosive, magic, or fire, as well as a bonus damage against buildings. The property of a unit's missile attack may also differ from its melee attack. Most units have resistances to particular properties and weaknesses to others. For example, the Dragon Samurai has excellent resistance against cutting attacks, but has a poor resistance to explosive and magic damage. Plot In single-player, the plot mainly revolves around Kenji, last heir to the Serpent's Throne. When he returns from exile, Kenji comes across bandits raiding a peasant village. He can choose to either kill the bandits and save the peasants, or he can side with the bandits and kill the peasants. If he chooses to save the peasants, he will follow the path of the Dragon clan. If he aids the bandits, he will follow the path of the Serpent clan. In Kenji's Journey, the player may choose which territories he or she wishes to attack first. (Otomo, his lieutenant, gives you the options.) When Kenji returns from Malcomson, he must decide whether to rebirth the Dragon Clan and save the peasants honor with righteousness or take up reigns in his brother's and his father, Lord Oja's, footsteps and lead the Serpent Clan. Taking specific territories might give benefits, and other Zen Masters may join Kenji. Later on, the player can summon these Zen Masters from the Keep. The story focuses on an artifact Called Tarrant's Orb/Orb of the Serpent which Kenji, the NPC Clans, and The Wolf and Lotus Clans are seeking out. Kenji must get to the Orb before them. There are four clans in the game: Dragon Clan, Serpent Clan, Wolf Clan, and Lotus Clan, each with their own motivations. The ancient Dragon Clan prizes honor above everything else. Due to their devotion to honor, the Dragon deity assists them during times of great peril. The Serpent Clan have forgotten their honorable ways and have resorted to thievery and deceit. Serpent clansmen are Yin followers. Wolf Clansmen prizes freedom above all else. Wolf Clansmen are down to earth, hardworking people, and take a delight in nature. Lotus clansmen follow the Forbidden Path, which focuses on death and decay.  Reception  The game was met with positive reception upon release, as GameRankings gave it a score of 82.04%, while Metacritic gave it 82 out of 100. Igromania magazine gave the game 9 out of 10, calling it an \\"ideal contemporary Real-time strategy\\". The reviewer noted good gameplay and praised the graphics and animations, but he said the game did not deviate much from traditional RTSes and the AI did not stand out. The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated Battle Realms for its 2001 \\"Computer Strategy Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Civilization III. Expansion Battle Realms: Winter of the Wolf is the expansion pack, announced on July 7, 2002 and released on November 5, 2002.

In 2019, the turnover was SEK 95,758 millionand the operating result was SEK 1,785 million. The number of employees was just over 1.500. Including partners, retailers and dealers, more than 3,000 people work under the Preem brand. Preem sells fuel via manned stations with service shops, automatic stations and filling stations intended for heavy commercial traffic. In 2017, the company released 2.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (of which about two-thirds at the Lysekil refinery). In 2019, the corresponding figure was 1.7 million tonnes To reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in the spring of 2020, Preem has started a CCS technology test facility, capturing and storing carbon dioxide. Preem is planning for an expansion at the Lysekil refinery, which is an ongoing process.

Acid Red 18, Brilliant Scarlet 3R, Brilliant Scarlet 4R, New Coccine, is a synthetic colourant that may be used as a food colouring. It is denoted by E Number E124. Its chemical name is 1-(4-sulfo-1-napthylazo)-2-napthol-6,8-disulfonic acid, trisodium salt. Ponceau (17th century French for \\"poppy-coloured\\") is the generic name for a family of azo dyes. Ponceau 4R is a strawberry red azo dye which can be used in a variety of food products, and is usually synthesized from aromatic hydrocarbons; it is stable to light, heat, and acid but fades in the presence of ascorbic acid. It is used in Europe, Asia and Australia, but has not been approved for human consumption by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Amine Floride mouthwash. Red colour is due to added Ponceau 4R.  Health effects  There is no evidence of carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, or reproductive and developmental toxicity at the permitted dietary exposures; the European acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.7 mg/kg and the WHO/FAO ADI is 4 mg/kg. The production process may result in unsulfonated aromatic amines present in concentrations of up to 100 mg/kg which may be linked to cancer. The lake pigment form of the colour additive can also increase the intake of aluminium beyond the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1 mg/kg/week. Therefore, the limit for aluminium may be adjusted to accommodate for this.EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) 091113 efsa.europa.eu Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of Ponceau 4R (E 124) as a food additive EFSA Journal 2009; 7(11):1328 = Possible cause of hyperactivity = Since the 1970s and the well-publicized advocacy of Benjamin Feingold, there has been public concern that food colourings may cause ADHD-like behavior in children.FDA. Background Document for the Food Advisory Committee: Certified Color Additives in Food and Possible Association with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children: March 30-31, 2011 These concerns have led the FDA and other food safety authorities to regularly review the scientific literature, and led the UK FSA to commission a study by researchers at Southampton University of the effect of a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red AC, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine (dubbed the \\"Southampton 6\\")) and sodium benzoate (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages; the study published in 2007.Sarah Chapman of Chapman Technologies on behalf of Food Standards Agency in Scotland. March 2011 [Guidelines on approaches to the replacement of Tartrazine, Allura Red, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine in food and beverages] The study found \\"a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity\\" in the children; the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended\\". The European regulatory community, with a stronger emphasis on the precautionary principle, required labelling and temporarily reduced the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for the food colourings; the UK FSA called for voluntary withdrawal of the colourings by food manufacturers. However, in 2009 the EFSA re-evaluated the data at hand and determined that \\"the available scientific evidence does not substantiate a link between the colour additives and behavioural effects\\". There is no evidence to support broad claims that food colouring causes food intolerance and ADHD-like behaviour in children.Tomaska LD and Brooke-Taylor, S.

The name may be considered appropriate when their small-sized head (3 mm diameter shaft) is compared to a bur (fruit seed with hooks) or their teeth are compared to a metal burr. Description Burrs are a rotary analog to files that cut linearly (hence their alternate name, rotary files). They are also in many ways comparable to endmills and to router bits; a distinction is that the latter usually have their toolpath controlled by the machine, whereas burrs are often used freehand. However, there is substantial overlap in the use and toolpath control of these various classes of cutters, and in the outcomes accomplished with them. For example, endmills can be used in routers, and burrs can be used like endmills in milling by CNC or manual machine tools. In fact, burrs (the tools) are often used in CNC machining centers for removing burrs (the small flakes of metal) after a machining process. To maintain the correct surface speed and cutting conditions, burrs are rotated at high speed (thousands or tens of thousands of RPM; often the top speed available on a given spindle). The cutters shown in the image are made from tungsten carbide, which allows them to operate at higher speeds than similar HSS cutters, yet still maintain their cutting edges. Because the cutting edges of burrs are so small, they can often be touched when spinning by a finger without cutting the skin, which flexes out of the way, although it would not be safe to pinch or grip them from two sides. Hard metal or ceramic workpieces cannot flex beyond the cutting edges, so the tools remove material from them. This characteristic makes burrs suitable for dentistry, as the tool will grind the hard enamel of teeth, yet leaves soft mouth tissues unharmed if the tool should unintentionally touch them.

She starred in many films directed by Jess Franco, such as Count Dracula (1970) and Vampyros Lesbos (1971). She also released numerous Spanish-language pop songs throughout the mid-sixties. She died in a car accident on a Lisbon highway at age 27.  Biography  = Early life = Soledad Miranda was born Soledad Rend√≥n Bueno on 9 July 1943 in Seville, Spain. Soledad (whose name translates as solitude or loneliness) was the niece of the famous Spanish singer-actress- flamenco dancer Paquita Rico. At age 8, Miranda made her professional debut when she was hired as a flamenco dancer and singer, first in the \\"Youth Galas\\" at the Seville Fair and San Fernando theatre, and then on a tour throughout southern Spain. = Career = At age 16, Miranda moved to Madrid and drew an artistic stage name out of a hat. She made her film debut in 1960 as a dancer in a musical called La bella Mim√≠. She was often in the tabloids as the rumored girlfriend of the most famous bullfighter of the time, Manuel Ben√≠tez (El Cordob√©s). Miranda went on to appear in over 30 films from 1960 to 1970. There were epic adventures (Ursus, Cervantes); horror films (Sound of Horror, Pyro); dramas (Canci√≥n de cuna, Currito de la Cruz); comedies (Eva 63, La familia y uno m√°s); and even a Spaghetti western (Sugar Colt). She also released a couple of y√©-y√© pop records in the mid-1960s. After taking nearly two years off to raise her son (see \\"Personal life\\"), she turned to acting with a role in the western 100 Rifles (1969). She went on appear in additional films and in Spanish television shows. Director Jess Franco, for whom Miranda had done a small role in his musical Queen of the Tabarin Club nearly a decade before, made Miranda his frequent star in films including Count Dracula, Eugenie de Sade, Vampyros Lesbos, She Killed in Ecstasy, and The Devil Came from Akasava. Miranda took the stage name Susann Korda (alternately spelled Susan Korday). = Personal life= In 1964, Miranda had made a trio of films in Portugal. Jos√© Manuel da Concei√ßao Sim√µes, a Portuguese racecar driver, was a producer and also acted in them. In one of the films, Un d√≠a en Lisboa (A Day in Lisbon), they played a couple traveling between Estoril and Lisbon. After a secret courtship, the pair married in 1966. In April 1967, Miranda gave birth to a son, Antonio. Her husband retired from racing and took a job in the auto industry. On the morning of 18 August 1970, near the end of filming The Devil Came from Akasava, Miranda and her husband were involved in a collision with a small truck. Sim√µes suffered minor injuries but Miranda died as a result of major head and back trauma.

Early life Andrew Ellicott was born in Buckingham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania as the first of nine children of Joseph Ellicott (1732‚Äì1780) and his wife Judith (n√©e Blaker or Bleaker, 1729‚Äì1809). The Quaker family lived in modest conditions; his father was a miller and clockmaker. Young Andrew was educated at the local Quaker school, where Robert Patterson, who later became a professor and vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, was his teacher for some time. Andrew was a talented mechanic like many of the family and showed some mathematical talent, too. In 1770, his father, together with his uncles Andrew and John, purchased land on the falls of the Patapsco River, upriver and west of Baltimore and the Chesapeake Bay. There they set up a new milling business, founding the town of Ellicott's Mills in 1772 (today's Ellicott City, Maryland). Three years later, Andrew married Sarah Brown (1756/8‚Äì1827) of Newtown, Pennsylvania, with whom he would have ten children, one of which died as a child. When the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, Andrew enlisted as a commissioned officer in the Elk Ridge Battalion of the newly organized Maryland state militia despite his Quaker upbringing. During the course of the war, he rose to the rank of major, a title he would keep as an honorific throughout his life. Survey work After the war, Ellicott returned home to Ellicott's Mills until he was appointed, in 1784, a member of the survey group tasked with extending the survey of the Mason-Dixon line for the borders between Pennsylvania / Delaware with Maryland that had been abandoned in 1767 and then been stalled during the war. In this survey, he worked alongside David Rittenhouse and Bishop James Madison, making first connections with the scientific society of Philadelphia. Following the death of their second son, the Ellicotts moved to Baltimore in 1785, where Andrew taught mathematics at the Baltimore Academy and was even elected to the General Assembly of Maryland (state legislature) in 1786. The same year, he was called upon for a survey to define the western border of Pennsylvania with the Ohio Country. This \\"Ellicott Line\\" (running north-south at longitude meridian 80¬∞31'12\\" WUnited States Coast Guard: ;idno=33;cc=ecfr Coast Guard Organization: Ninth Coast Guard District: Buffalo Marine Inspection Zone , 2007.) later became the principal meridian for the surveys of the future Northwest Territory of the United States.N.N.: The Point of Beginning of the United States Public Land Survey , Milestones 3(4), 1977. His work in Pennsylvania intensified his ties with Rittenhouse and other members of the American Philosophical Society and led to encounters with Benjamin Franklin and Simeon De Witt. When he was subsequently appointed to lead other surveys in Pennsylvania, the family moved again in 1789 to Philadelphia. By recommendation of Franklin, Ellicott got a position with the newly established government under the Constitution and was tasked by first President George Washington to survey the lands between Lake Erie and Pennsylvania to determine the border between Western New York and U.S. federal territory, resulting in the Erie Triangle. This survey, during which he also made the first topographical study of the Niagara River including the Niagara Falls, gained Ellicott a reputation for superb accuracy in surveys.

He was assisted in this survey first by the free African-American astronomer Benjamin Banneker and then by Ellicott's brothers, Joseph Ellicott and Benjamin Ellicott. Ellicott's team put into place forty boundary stones approximately 1 mile (2 km) apart from each other that marked the borders of the Territory of Columbia of (see: Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia). Most of these stones remain in their original positions. As engravings on many of the stones still show, Ellicott's team placed those that marked the southwestern /southeastern border with Virginia in 1791, and those that marked the northwestern / northeastern border with Maryland in 1792.

Ellicott also served under the Commissioners' supervision in this effort. He first worked with Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, who had prepared the initial plans for the future capital city during the early months of 1791 and had presented one of these early plans to President Washington in August of that year (see L'Enfant Plan). During a contentious period in February 1792, Ellicott informed the Commissioners that L'Enfant had not been able to have the city plan engraved and printed as a map on paper and had refused to provide him with an original plan that L'Enfant was then holding. Ellicott, with the aid of his brother, Benjamin Ellicott, then revised the plan, despite L'Enfant's protests.(1) (2) Kite, Elizabeth S. \\"L'Enfant and Washington 1791‚Äì1792\\".

As the conflicts grew between the contending parties shortly thereafter, President Washington dismissed L'Enfant. Ellicott gave the first version of his own plan to James Thakara and John Valance of Philadelphia, who engraved, printed and published it. This version, printed in March 1792, was the first Washington city plan that received wide circulation. After L'Enfant departed, Ellicott continued the city survey in accordance with his revised plan, several larger and more detailed versions of which were also engraved, published, printed and distributed. As a result, Ellicott's revisions became the basis for the capital city's future development. When he later quit the City of Washington project, Ellicott was relieved to escape the political pressures surrounding that venture. In 1794, Ellicott accepted a commission from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to plan the city of Erie on the southeastern shore of Lake Erie, giving the Keystone State a future port on the Great Lakes and its increasing trade. He spent the next two years with this task, plotting a road from Reading, Pennsylvania, to Presqu'Isle, where the port city was to be built, and also supervising the construction of Fort Erie. In 1796, George Washington commissioned Ellicott as the U.S. representative on the commission for the survey of the southern border between the Spanish territories along the Gulf of Mexico coast in Florida and the United States as negotiated in the Treaty of San Lorenzo (also known as Treaty of Madrid) of 1795. Ellicott travelled with a military escort from Pittsburgh via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and worked together with Spanish commissioners, despite many difficulties, for the next four years. Another \\"Ellicott's Line\\" from this survey, running along latitude parallel 31¬∞ North, still defines the border today between the future states of Alabama and Florida.State of Alabama: Code of Alabama, sect. 41.2.3: Boundary between Alabama and Florida - Generally , 1975. One of his many stone markers for the boundary line, the Ellicott Stone, is now located within a historical park about a mile south of Bucks, Alabama. In 1798, Ellicott complained to the government about four American generals receiving pensions from Spain, including General in Chief James Wilkinson, raising the specter of treason, which later involved Vice President (during Jefferson's first term), Aaron Burr. Ellicott showed considerable diplomatic talent during this joint project to bring it to a successful completion, and he presented his final report with maps to the government in 1800. (The Mapping episode of Philip Morrison's miniseries The Ring Of Truth illustrates Ellicott's surveying methods from Ellicott Hill in Natchez, Mississippi, which is now another National Historic Landmark.) The following Adams administration, however, then refused to pay Ellicott for his work done in this survey, and even refused him access to his maps he had submitted with the report. He was forced to sell some of his possessions, including books from his library, in order to support his family. Finally the maps were released in 1803 under the subsequent Jefferson administration, and Ellicott published his Journal of Andrew Ellicott detailing the Florida survey, including the maps. The third President Thomas Jefferson then offered Ellicott the post of Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory. However, Ellicott refused the appointment. His prior negative experiences with the government political administrations may have had something to do with this,Mathews, pp. 204‚Äì206 but at the age of 49, he also wanted to spend more time with his family and feared that this new position might require him to travel too much. Ellicott's house at 123 North Prince Street, Lancaster, Pennsylvania is listed on the National Register of Historic Places Ellicott instead accepted an offer by Pennsylvania governor Thomas McKean and took a position as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Land Office. The family moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Ellicott seemed content with a clerk's job that left him enough time for his own scientific and private interests and that provided a steady income for the family. The Andrew Ellicott House, in Lancaster where he resided from 1801 to 1813, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, by the National Park Service.(1) (2) Also in 1803, President Jefferson engaged Ellicott as a mentor and teacher for Meriwether Lewis, one of the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition that was to start the following year. From April to May 1803, Lewis stayed at Ellicott's home and studied survey techniques, and Ellicott made many recommendations on the expedition's equipment and survey procedures that were later followed. The two men apparently got along well. When Simon Snyder followed McKean as governor of Pennsylvania, he fired Ellicott in 1809 due to political differences. A prominent supporter of Snyder was former General in Chief James Wilkinson, one of the four generals that Ellicott had denounced eleven years earlier and had come under a cloud of treason, along with Vice President Aaron Burr. Ellicott returned to private practice and was hired in February 1811 by David B. Mitchell, then governor of Georgia, to re-survey the border between Georgia and North Carolina to settle a border dispute between these two states. Although he started out in July, his expedition was delayed and had to work throughout the hard winter. Ellicott confirmed earlier findings that the border, which was supposed to follow latitude 35¬∞N, was several miles further south than the Georgians claimed. His report was not well received by the Georgian administration, who furthermore refused to pay his fees. Ellicott returned in July 1812 to Pennsylvania. In 1813, Ellicott accepted a position as a professor for mathematics at the military academy at West Point, and the family left Lancaster and moved to West Point, New York. In 1817, Ellicott was again called upon to participate as astronomer in a field survey, namely a re-survey ‚Äì agreed upon in the Treaty of Ghent ‚Äì of the Collins‚ÄìValentine line. It was the last significant survey that he performed. Ellicott died three years later from a stroke in his home at West Point.

The Ibex Valley is bounded by Ibex Mountain to the south; Mount Arkell and Mount Ingram to the west; Mount Sumanik and Mount Williams to the east. Description The valley is generally undeveloped, with some recreational use trails. The vegetation consists of coniferous trees and grasslands typically found in the sub-alpine ecosystem. The southern (higher) portion of the valley runs from south to north for about 15 km, at which point the axis of the valley turns to the northwest. This southeast - northwest section of the valley has a much shallower slope and the valley floor is wider. =Surficial Geology= Generally, near surface geology of the valley consists of fluvial and glaciofluvial deposits of sand, gravel and silt units in the bottom of the valley. The valley sideslopes are made up of varying layers of colluvium and/or till moraines overlying bedrock. In some areas, the bedrock is exposed on the valley walls. Land use As the valley is mostly undeveloped, the land use is primarily recreational. Some trails exist. The trails are typically used for hiking, mountain biking, bouldering, cross country skiing, snow mobiling and dog sleding.

However, the latter was cured when young Sidney mutated into the huge rock-like form he now possesses, much to his delight. Onyxx became a student at the Xavier Institute, assigned to Gambit's training squad, the Chevaliers.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z, vol. 13 (2010) Onyxx had a romantic interest in a new student at the Institute by the name of Foxx. It was later revealed that Foxx was actually a long time adversary of the X-Men, Mystique. She infiltrated the school to destabilize the relationship between Gambit and her foster daughter Rogue. After having revealed herself to the X-Men, Onyxx attacked Mystique for not returning his affection. Mystique escaped and, with the help of an accomplice, injured Onyxx. Onyxx's fellow student Bling was also attracted to Foxx, and their shared infatuation may have been the basis of a friendship, since the two are often seen together. Bling once referred to Onyxx as \\"Randy,\\" which could be interpreted as a playful nickname (\\"randy\\" being a synonym for \\"horny\\") but was more likely a writer's error.New X-Men, vol. 2 #35 =Decimation= Sidney retained his powers post M-Day and continued residing at the school.

The concept normally applies to baskets that beat an end-of- quarter/half/overtime buzzer but is sometimes applied to shots that beat the shot clock buzzer. Officials in the National Collegiate Athletic Association, National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, Serie A (Italy), and the Euroleague (Final Four series only, effective 2006) are required to use instant replay to assess whether a shot made at the end of a period was in fact released before the game clock expired. Since 2002, the NBA also has mandated LED light strips along the edges of the backboard and the edge of the scorer's table for the purposes of identifying the end of a period. Notable buzzer beaters Although buzzer beaters are fairly common, several instances have been recognized as special occasions: =NCAA= *Dubbed \\"The Dunk\\", in the 1983 NCAA Championship Finals, NC State forward Lorenzo Charles caught Derek Whittenburg's airball and dunked it as time expired to defeat Houston 54‚Äì52. In the most improbable match-ups, NC State won its last 10 games of the season, including ACC Tournament Championship to become eligible for the NCAA Tournament. NC State also had the most regular season losses (10) of any previous NCAA Champion. *In the 1992 East Regional Finals, with 2.1 seconds left and down 103‚Äì102 in overtime, Duke forward Christian Laettner caught a full court inbounds pass from Grant Hill, turned and hit a 17-footer (5 m) at the buzzer to give the Duke Blue Devils a 104‚Äì103 victory over the Kentucky Wildcats. The lead changed hands five times in the last 31.5 seconds of overtime.Laettner's buzzer beater ended '92 classic *In the 1992 NCAA Tournament, the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets' legendary coach Bobby Cremins led an inexperienced Tech team to the Sweet 16, thanks in no small part to James Forrest's buzzer-beating game-winning 3-pointer in the second round against USC (to which CBS commentator Al McGuire famously shouted, \\"Holy mackerel! Holy mackerel! Holy mackerel!\\"). With eight tenths of a second left, Forrest received a half-court inbounds pass, rotated 180 degrees and hit a three-pointer at the buzzer for the win. *On January 5, 2004, the Texas Longhorns' forward P. J. Tucker hit a buzzer beater in a game against Providence College to win 79‚Äì77 in OT. After extensive looks at instant replay, it was clear that the ball was in his hand when the game clock hit 0.0, but out before the red backboard light came on; by rule, the game ends when the backboard lights up, so the basket counted and Texas won the game. *On January 31, 2005, Guilford College was tied at 88 with Randolph- Macon College. Randolph-Macon was shooting 2 free throws with 6 tenths of a second left. After making the first to take an 89‚Äì88 lead, the second shot missed. Guilford player Jordan Snipes grabbed the rebound under the basket and threw the ball towards the other goal. The shot went in, giving Guilford a 91‚Äì89 victory. Snipes duplicated the feat several days later on air with the local news network WFMY-TV in Greensboro, North Carolina.Player Who Made Miracle Shot Does It Again *In the 2006 NCAA Tournament First Round, #14 seed Northwestern State (LA) stunned the #3 seed Iowa Hawkeyes 64‚Äì63 with a last second three-pointer \\"off the heels\\" in the far corner by Jermaine Wallace. Northwestern State had come back from 17 points down with 8 minutes to play. *In a 2010 NCAA regular season game against Georgia Tech, the Maryland Terrapins, in essence, made two buzzer beaters (with only the second one counting). First, with 3 seconds on the clock, Greivis Vasquez made a half- court shot on the run to beat what would have been the buzzer. However, Maryland coach Keith Booth had called timeout with 1.5 seconds left, before Vasquez had released the ball. Following the timeout on the ensuing inbounds pass, the Terps got the ball to Cliff Tucker, who made a three-pointer at the buzzer to win the game 76‚Äì74.Ranking Tucker's clutch 3-pointer *On February 7, 2013, in an NCAA regular season game, Tyler Griffey made an uncontested buzzer-beating layup off an inbounds pass with 9 tenths of a second left to lead the Illinois Fighting Illini to a 74‚Äì72 upset home win over #1 ranked Indiana Hoosiers. *On March 18, 2016, during the first round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament, Paul Jesperson of Northern Iowa made a buzzer beater from half court to win the game for the 11th seeded Panthers 75‚Äì72, and upset the 6th seeded Texas Longhorns. *On March 20, 2016, during the second round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament, with 2.6 seconds left and the game tied at 63, Wisconsin's Bronson Koenig made a 3-point buzzer beater after receiving an inbound pass from Ethan Happ. This resulted in the 7th seeded Wisconsin upsetting the 2nd seeded Xavier. *On April 4, 2016, Villanova's Kris Jenkins hit a three-pointer at the buzzer to defeat North Carolina to win the 2016 NCAA Tournament, 77‚Äì74. =NBA Playoffs= * In Game 1 of the 1950 NBA Finals, Bob Harrison hit a 40-foot (12 m) buzzer-beater to win the game for the Lakers, 68‚Äì66.NBA.com: George Mikan Bio * In Game 3 of the 1962 NBA finals, Jerry West steals the ball and makes a layup as the time expired to give the lakers a 2-1 lead over the Celtics. {{Cite web url=https://www.basketball- reference.com/friv/buzzer-beaters.html * In Game 4 of the 1969 NBA Finals, Sam Jones hit an off-balance 18-footer (5.5 m) as time expired to lift the Celtics to a series-tying 89‚Äì88 win over the Lakers. * In Game 3 of the 1970 NBA Finals, with the Lakers trailing the Knicks 102‚Äì100. Jerry West sank a desperation buzzer-beating 60-foot (18 m) shot to tie the game. Since the three-point field goal was not adopted until the 1979‚Äì80 NBA season, it only tied the game. The Lakers lost 111‚Äì108 in OT. * In Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals, Gar Heard hit a buzzer beater against the Boston Celtics to tie the game at 112 and force a third overtime. This was one of the many high points of the game, which the Celtics won, 128‚Äì126. Heard's shot is one of the many reasons the NBA refers to Game 5 as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\".SUNS: Greatest Game Ever * In Game 1 of the 1986 Eastern Conference First Round, Dudley Bradley banked in a 3-pointer at the buzzer to win the game 95‚Äì94 for the Bullets after the 76ers led 94‚Äì77 with 3 minutes left. * In Game 3 of the 1986 Western Conference Semifinals, Derek Harper hit a long 3 with 3 seconds left to beat the Lakers, 110‚Äì108. * In Game 5 of the 1986 Western Conference Finals, the Rockets and Lakers were tied at 112 with 1 second left and the ball at half-court. Ralph Sampson hit a turn-around shot at the buzzer to win the series for Houston. * In Game 5 of the 1989 Eastern Conference First Round, Michael Jordan took the inbounds pass with 3 seconds left, sprinted to the free throw line and hit The Shot over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 101‚Äì100. * In Game 4 of the 1993 Eastern Conference First Round, with Charlotte down 103‚Äì102 with 3.3 seconds left, Alonzo Mourning took the inbounds pass and hit a 20-footer (6 m) with 4 tenths left. * In Game 4 of the 1993 Eastern Conference Semifinals, \\"The Shot II\\". With the score tied at 101, Michael Jordan made an 18-foot fade-away over Gerald Wilkins at the buzzer to give the Bulls a 103‚Äì101 victory and sweep Cleveland. * In Game 3 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Semifinals with 1.8 seconds left and the Bulls down 2‚Äì0 in the series, Toni Kukoƒç sank a 23-ft (7 m) fadeaway at the buzzer to give Chicago a 104‚Äì102 victory over New York. * In Game 5 of the 1995 Western Conference Semifinals, Nick Van Exel hit a 3 with 5 tenths of a second left in OT to give the Lakers a 98‚Äì96 win over the Spurs. He had also hit a 3 with 10.2 seconds left in regulation to tie it at 88 and force overtime. * In Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals, Reggie Miller scored 8 points in 8.9 seconds to erase a 6-point deficit and beat New York, 107‚Äì105. * In Game 4 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Finals, Indiana's Rik Smits faked a shot over Tree Rollins, then hit a 10-footer (3 m) at the buzzer to beat Orlando 94‚Äì93. The lead changed hands four times in the last 13.3 seconds. * In Game 1 of the 1995 NBA Finals, Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon tipped in a missed layup by Clyde Drexler with 3 tenths of a second left in OT to beat the Magic 120‚Äì118. * In Game 4 of the 1997 Western Conference First Round, the Suns' Rex Chapman caught an overthrown Jason Kidd pass and made a falling-out-of-bounds 3 with 1.9 seconds left to tie it at 107.

Derrick McKey inbounded to Reggie Miller, who hit the game-winning 3 with 7 tenths left. * In Game 5 of the 1999 Eastern Conference First Round, Allan Houston hit a runner with 8 tenths of a second left to beat Miami 78‚Äì77. This also meant New York was just the 2nd #8 seed at the time to beat a #1 seed. * In Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Western Conference Finals, the Lakers were trailing the Kings 99‚Äì97 with 11.8 seconds left. The Lakers were trailing 2‚Äì1 in the series and faced Game 5 in Sacramento. After Kobe Bryant and Shaq missed consecutive layups, Vlade Divac swatted the ball away in a vain attempt to run out the clock. However, it went right to Robert Horry, who caught the ball and hit a three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Lakers a 100‚Äì99 victory. * In Game 1 of the 2003 Western Conference First Round, Stephon Marbury of the Phoenix Suns scored a buzzer beater and had a 96-95 victory against the San Antonio Spurs. * In Game 5 of the 2004 Western Conference Semifinals, Tim Duncan made a fade-away 18-footer (5.5 m) over Shaquille O'Neal to give the Spurs a 73‚Äì72 lead with 4 tenths of a second left, but Derek Fisher hit a 20-footer (6 m) at the buzzer to win the game for the Lakers 74‚Äì73. * In Game 5 of the 2004 Eastern Conference Semifinals, with the series tied at 2, the Detroit Pistons were down 88‚Äì85 to the Nets with no timeouts. Chauncey Billups banked in a 3 from half-court at the buzzer to tie the game at 88. Detroit lost in 3OT, but won the series in 7 and proceeded to defeat the Lakers 4‚Äì1 in the NBA Finals. * In Game 4 of the 2006 Western Conference First Round, Kobe Bryant made a buzzer beater to defeat Phoenix 99‚Äì98 and give the Lakers a 3‚Äì1 series lead. * In Game 2 of the 2009 Eastern Conference Finals, LeBron James took the inbounds pass and hit a 3 at the buzzer to give the Cavaliers a 96‚Äì95 victory over the Orlando Magic. * In Game 5 of the 2010 Western Conference Finals, after Kobe Bryant air- balled a 3, Ron Artest hit the put-back at the buzzer to give the Los Angeles Lakers a 103‚Äì101 win over the Phoenix Suns to give the Lakers a 3‚Äì2 series lead. The Lakers won the series 4‚Äì2 and went on to win their 2nd straight title. * In Game 1 of the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat down 102‚Äì101 in overtime against the Indiana Pacers, LeBron James made a driving lay-up as time expired in OT to give the Heat a 103‚Äì102 win over the Pacers. * In Game 3 of the 2014 Western Conference First Round, Vince Carter hit a 3 from the left corner at the buzzer, giving the Mavericks a 109‚Äì108 victory and a 2‚Äì1 series lead over the San Antonio Spurs. However, Dallas would lose in 7 games to the eventual NBA champion Spurs. * In Game 6 of the 2014 Western Conference First Round, with the Portland Trail Blazers down 98‚Äì96 with 9 tenths left, Damian Lillard hit a buzzer beating 3 off the inbounds pass to beat the Houston Rockets 99‚Äì98 and win the series 4‚Äì2. * In Game 3 of the 2015 Eastern Conference Semifinals, Derrick Rose banked in a 3 at the buzzer to give the Chicago Bulls a 99‚Äì96 win against the Cavaliers and take a 2‚Äì1 series lead. * In Game 4 of the 2015 Eastern Conference Semifinals, LeBron James hit a corner 2 at the buzzer to give the Cavaliers a 86‚Äì84 win against the Bulls and tie the series at two, while Cavaliers coach David Blatt was being held back from trying to call a timeout. Cleveland had none at the time, and the technical foul would have given Chicago a free throw and possession. * In Game 3 of the 2015 Eastern Conference Semifinals, Paul Pierce banked in a step-back 21-footer (6.5 m) at the buzzer to give the Washington Wizards a 103‚Äì101 win against the Atlanta Hawks and take a 2‚Äì1 series lead. * In Game 1 of the 2016 Eastern Conference Semifinals, Kyle Lowry of the Toronto Raptors hit a half- court shot at the buzzer to tie it at 90.

As time expired, Belov hit a layup that won the game 51‚Äì50 against the U.S. team.1972 USA vs *In the second round of the 1997 Eurobasket, in a high-strung game between FR Yugoslavia and Croatia (the first one after the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia and the ensuing Yugoslav wars), Aleksandar ƒêorƒëeviƒá won the game for Yugoslavia 64‚Äì62 with a coast-to-coast three-pointer. The same player won the 1992 Euroleague title for Partizan Belgrade in strikingly similar fashion (albeit with 2 seconds left on the clock). *(Euroleague) On April 7, 2004, Maccabi Tel Aviv was trailing ≈Ωalgiris at home, on the decisive round-robin match to determine which team advances to the Final Four tournament, held later that month on Maccabi's home court in Tel Aviv. Maccabi's failure to advance would mean utter disaster, as team officials battled all season long against Euroleague attempts to relocate the tournament due to ensuing Al-Aqsa intifada and similar UEFA ban on football (soccer) matches hosted in Israel. With 2 seconds remaining and Maccabi trailing by 3, Derrick Sharp caught a long pass from Gur Shelef, turned to the basket and fired a game-tying fade-away three-pointer, forcing overtime. Maccabi won that game, advanced to the Final Four and became Euroleague Champion, winning the final game against Skipper Bologna by the all-time record score of 118‚Äì74.Maccabi-Zalgiris Report * On August 15, 2004, in the first game of the Olympic Games, after a run of Alejandro Montecchia, Manu Gin√≥bili received the ball trailing 82‚Äì81 against Serbia and Montenegro with 7 tenths of a second left. He made the shot while falling sideways after it hit the board. Argentina then would win the gold medal. * In an exhibition match between the US and Germany during the run-up to the 2004 Olympics, a less than stellar Team USA was saved by Allen Iverson (then of the Philadelphia 76ers), who hit a half-court shot to keep the game from going into overtime. * On April 25, 2010, in the title game of the 2009‚Äì10 ABA League, Partizan Belgrade topped Cibona Zagreb in overtime in Arena Zagreb, thanks to an off-the-glass three- pointer by Du≈°an Kecman from half-court at the buzzer, bringing the celebration of Cibona players and staff (who already invaded the floor as Bojan Bogdanoviƒá hit a corner three-pointer for Cibona with just 6 tenths left on the clock) to an abrupt end. Partizan thus won its fourth consecutive Adriatic League title. The final score was 75‚Äì74.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wu15IKPQy4) * On January 24, 2014, in a Top 16 Euroleague game between Anadolu Efes and EA7 Emporio Armani Milan, Efes was trailing by two points when Keith Langford from Milan had another free throw attempt (after hitting the first one) with three seconds left on the game clock. He then probably missed the second free throw on purpose so that Anadolu Efes cannot take another timeout. Zoran Planiniƒá from Anadolu Efes then grabbed the rebound, took one dribble and threw the ball from within their own three point line to the basket of Milan. He made it and no time remained on the game clock; the final score was 61‚Äì60.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83bSLQIHsY * On April 25, 2014, in the semifinal game of the 2013‚Äì14 ABA League Final Four, between Partizan Belgrade and Cedevita Zagreb, Cedevita was trailing with 1 point and possession less. Milenko Tepiƒá of Partizan missed the three-point shot with 6 seconds left, Nolan Smith of Cedevita grabbed the ball, ran to the other side of the court with his defenders not guarding him, and hit a running three-point buzzer beater from 30 feet (9 m). The final score was 81‚Äì79. The significance of that shot is even more than just a victory, if it is known that it secured a direct spot in the 2014‚Äì15 Euroleague season for Cedevita, while leaving Partizan out of the Euroleague for the first time after 14 years, and the first time since ULEB takeover of the competition in 2000. * On September 16, 2018, Greece national basketball team qualified to the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup after a thrilling win with a buzzer beater made by Kostas Papanikolaou after a Nick Calathes assist in Tbilisi over Georgia 86‚Äì85.https://greece.greekreporter.com/2018/09/16/buzzer-beater-sends-greek- hoopsters-to-world-cup-video/ In other sports The term is sometimes applied to analogous achievements in other sports. =Ice hockey= In ice hockey, a buzzer beater is a goal that is scored just before the clock expires in a period. Unlike in basketball, the puck must completely cross the goal line with 0.1 seconds or more remaining on the clock in order for the goal to count; if the period expires (the exact moment when the green goal light comes on at 0.0 seconds) before the puck completely crosses the goal line, the goal is disallowed. =Football= In Australian rules football there are kicks after the siren, where a mark or free kick awarded just before the end of a quarter may be kicked as the final action of that period. In Gaelic football play is extended to allow for the kick of a free kick or puck awarded prior to the end of a half. In gridiron football, a touchdown after time expires or a field goal (or, much more rarely, a successful fair catch kick) kicked as time expires can be described as a \\"buzzer beater,\\" though no actual buzzers are used in that sport. More generally, in all codes, if a play (whether or not involving a kick) is in progress at the time the clock expires, play continues until the ball is dead. (In American football, the snap on the buzzer-beating play must take place before the clock expired, except if the defense commits a foul on the last play, in which case an untimed down is added. In Canadian football, a play can and must be executed even if the clock expires after the previous play but before the snap.) Several important games have been decided on the outcome of buzzer beaters, such as Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XXXVIII, both of which were decided on successful kicks by Adam Vinatieri; in contrast, Scott Norwood's infamous missed kick in Super Bowl XXV decided that game in favor of the opposing New York Giants. A related concept in football is the Hail Mary pass. In rugby union the game does not end until the ball goes dead after time has expired ‚Äì therefore if a side trailing by less than one score can maintain possession and keep the ball in play they have a chance of victory. A rule change in 2017\\"2017 Rugby Law Changes\\", \\"Sport24\\", 31/01/2017 amended the rules so that if a penalty is awarded the ball can be kicked out and a line-out taken, even if time has elapsed. The rules in rugby league also allow for play after time has elapsed; however, a tackle will also end the game, meaning that significant extensions are less likely. =Lacrosse= Starting with the 2018 season, the National Federation of State High School Associations rules for high school boys' field lacrosse in the United States allow for buzzer-beaters. A goal counts if the shot was released before the official's whistle signaling the end of play for any period of the game, even if it goes in after having previously contacted part of the goal or a defensive player (post-whistle shots that contact an offensive player in any way before entering the goal, however, do not count). The opposing team may request a stick check after buzzer-beaters, unless it comes at the end of the game and does not result in overtime, since the rules consider the game over at that point.Rule 4, Section 9, Article 2o, 2018 Rule Book, p. 42 US Lacrosse similarly changed the youth rules the same season to allow buzzer-beaters.Rule 4.8.1; However, the National Collegiate Athletic Association rules for men's lacrosse still require that any shot enter the goal before the whistle to score.Rule 4, Section 11a, See also * Walk-off home run References Category:Basketball terminology Category:Ice hockey terminology ","title":"Buzzer beater"},{"id":"2428487","text":"Nowergup is a rural locality about north of Perth, Western Australia. It is in the local government area of the City of Wanneroo. History The suburb of Nowergup (sometimes spelled Nowgerup in earlier documents) takes its name from Lake Nowergup. The lake name was first recorded by Surveyor General John Septimus Roe in 1841, and is a Noongar word which possibly means \\"place of sweet water\\". It was approved as a suburb name in 1982. Geography Nowergup is bounded by Romeo Road/Karoborup Road to the north, the proposed Mitchell Freeway to the west, Pinjar Road to the east and Hester Avenue and Wattle Avenue to the south. At the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011 census, Nowergup had a population of 212 people living in 81 dwellings. Facilities Nowergup is a sparsely populated agricultural suburb. Several plant nurseries, the Ocean View Tavern and the Nowergup Lake wetland and fauna sanctuary are situated along Wanneroo Road. The western strip between Wanneroo Road and the proposed Mitchell Freeway is approximately the northern half of the Neerabup National Park. The area also contains most of the Pinjar Pine Plantation, numerous sand and limestone quarries and a Water Corporation biosolids facility. Barbagallo Raceway, WA's premier motorsport facility, is located just beyond Nowergup's southern border. The Nowergup railway depot is located off Hester Avenue and marks the end of the Joondalup railway line. Ocean View Tavern on Wanneroo Road. Transport Nowergup was served by the Transperth 490 bus route between Clarkson train station and Two Rocks along Wanneroo Road. However, the service was relocated to Marmion Avenue on 14 December 2008 and the suburb is no longer served. Politics Nowergup's political leanings are unclear due to its small size and the lack of a polling booth. The nearest large booths tend to favour the Australian Labor Party historically, although most have been won by the Coalition in recent times, especially at federal level.

When the Nazi Party rose to power, he objected to its political restrictions on academic positions, leaving to take a position as a physicist with industrial dye firm I.G. Farbenwerke at Ludwigshafen, where he continued his crystallographic research and studied symmetry in higher-dimensional spaces. During World War II, he and his wife Eva helped many Jews hide and escape the Holocaust, for which he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. As he was an eminent scientist with influential friends, the sentence was never carried out. After the war, he lectured briefly at Darmstadt Polytechnic. Then, in 1947, he accepted a newly formed chair in crystallography at the University of Marburg, where he became director of the Crystallographic Institute and remained until his death. He was an active Quaker and devoted much time to promoting international understanding. In August 1994, the German Crystallographic Society (DGK) established the Carl Hermann Medal, its highest distinction, for outstanding contributions to the science of crystallography.

The electrophoresis was performed in thin layers of agarose, the pictured gel is about 7x7 cm. The lower part is the first dimension gel without antibodies, where the serum was applied into the slot at the lower left.

Peak \\"a\\" is unretained, peak \\"b\\" is retained and eluted with methyl-mannose, the arrow indicates som slightly retained proteins. __TOC__ Immunoelectrophoresis is a general name for a number of biochemical methods for separation and characterization of proteins based on electrophoresis and reaction with antibodies. All variants of immunoelectrophoresis require immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, reacting with the proteins to be separated or characterized. The methods were developed and used extensively during the second half of the 20th century. In somewhat chronological order: Immunoelectrophoretic analysis (one-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Grabar), crossed immunoelectrophoresis (two- dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell), rocket-immunoelectrophoresis (one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Laurell), fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Svendsen and Harboe, affinity immunoelectrophoresis ad modum B√∏g-Hansen. Method Agarose as 1% gel slabs of about 1 mm thickness buffered at high pH (around 8.6) is traditionally preferred for the electrophoresis as well as the reaction with antibodies. The agarose was chosen as the gel matrix because it has large pores allowing free passage and separation of proteins, but provides an anchor for the immunoprecipitates of protein and specific antibodies. The high pH was chosen because antibodies are practically immobile at high pH. An electrophoresis equipment with a horizontal cooling plate was normally recommended for the electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitates may be seen in the wet agarose gel, but are stained with protein stains like Coomassie Brilliant Blue in the dried gel. In contrast to SDS-gel electrophoresis, the electrophoresis in agarose allows native conditions, preserving the native structure and activities of the proteins under investigation, therefore immunoelectrophoresis allows characterization of enzyme activities and ligand binding etc. in addition to electrophoretic separation. The immunoelectrophoretic analysis ad modum Grabar is the classical method of immunoelectrophoresis. Proteins are separated by electrophoresis, then antibodies are applied in a trough next to the separated proteins and immunoprecipitates are formed after a period of diffusion of the separated proteins and antibodies against each other. The introduction of the immunoelectrophoretic analysis gave a great boost to protein chemistry, some of the very first results were the resolution of proteins in biological fluids and biological extracts. Among the important observations made were the great number of different proteins in serum, the existence of several immunoglobulin classes and their electrophoretic heterogeneity. Plasmodium Glutamate dehydrogenase (pGluDH) separated by Counterimmunoelectrophoresis Crossed immunoelectrophoresis is also called two-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell. In this method the proteins are first separated during the first dimension electrophoresis, then instead of the diffusion towards the antibodies, the proteins are electrophoresed into an antibody-containing gel in the second dimension. Immunoprecipitation will take place during the second dimension electrophorsis and the immunoprecipitates have a characteristic bell-shape, each precipitate representing one antigen, the position of the precipitate being dependent on the amount of protein as well as the amount of specific antibody in the gel, so relative quantification can be performed. The sensitivity and resolving power of crossed immunoelectrophoresis is than that of the classical immunoelectrophoretic analysis and there are multiple variations of the technique useful for various purposes. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis has been used for studies of proteins in biological fluids, particularly human serum, and biological extracts. Rocket immunoelectrophoresis is one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis. The method has been used for quantitation of human serum proteins before automated methods became available. Fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis is a modification of one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophorsis used for detailed measurement of proteins in fractions from protein separation experiments. Affinity immunoelectrophoresis is based on changes in the electrophoretic pattern of proteins through specific interaction or complex formation with other macromolecules or ligands. Affinity immunoelectrophoresis has been used for estimation of binding constants, as for instance with lectins or for characterization of proteins with specific features like glycan content or ligand binding. Some variants of affinity immunoelectrophoresis are similar to affinity chromatography by use of immobilized ligands. The open structure of the immunoprecipitate in the agarose gel will allow additional binding of radioactively labeled antibodies to reveal specific proteins. This variation has been used for identification of allergens through reaction with IgE. Two factors determine that immunoelectrophoretic methods are not widely used. First they are rather work intensive and require some manual expertise. Second they require rather large amounts of polyclonal antibodies. Today gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting is the preferred method for protein characterization because its ease of operation, its high sensitivity, and its low requirement for specific antibodies. In addition proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis on the basis of their apparent molecular weight, which is not accomplished by immunoelectrophoresis, but nevertheless immunoelectrophoretic methods are still useful when non-reducing conditions are needed.

The Lozi people consist of more than 46 different ethnic groups and are primarily situated in western Zambia, inhabiting the region of Barotseland. Lozi is also a nationality of the people of Barotseland. It is one of the many East African tribes. The Lozi people number approximately 3,575,000. Lozi are also found in Zambia, Namibia (Caprivi Strip), Angola, Botswana, Mozambique (50,000), and Zimbabwe (8,000). The Lozi are also known as the Malozi, Nyambe, Makololo, Barotose, Rotse, Rozi, Rutse, or Tozvi. Name The word Lozi means 'plain' in the Makololo language, in reference to the Barotse Floodplain of the Zambezi on and around which most Lozi live. It may also be spelled Lotse or Rotse, the spelling Lozi having originated with German missionaries in what is now Namibia. Mu- and Ba- are corresponding singular and plural prefixes for certain nouns in the Silozi language, so Murotse means 'person of the plain' while Barotse means 'people of the plain. History Harold Macmillan meets Paramount King of the Barotse in Northern Rhodesia (1960). Lozi tradition states that they have always inhabited Barotseland. In about 1830, an army that originated in the Sotho- speaking Bafokeng region of South Africa, known as the Makololo, led by a warrior called Sebetwane, invaded Barotseland and conquered the Lozi. They ruled until 1864 when the Sotho clique was overthrown following a Lozi revolt. Portraits of Barotse people (1881) The political organisation of the Lozi has long centred on a monarchy, whose reigning head, the Paramount King, is known as 'Litunga' which means 'keeper of the earth.' The renowned Litunga Lewanika, whose latter name was a nickname from the Mbunda meaning \\"unifier\\" following the Lozi revolt that overthrew the Sotho clique, reigned from 1878 to 1916 with a short insurrectionist break in 1884-85, requested Queen Victoria to bring Barotseland under protectorate status. Great Britain, however, was uninterested in acquiring the territory. A granting of a royal charter for the British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes allowed the company to acquire Barotseland under the guise of the British government. Although under protectorate status, Lewanika eventually realized that he had been tricked and petitioned for the protectorate status to be corrected. Yet, the land remained under Rhodes's control, and when the territory failed to produce gold, copper or other exports, the \\"British South Africa Company defaulted on every commitment it had made to Lewanika,\\" and few developments in infrastructure and education were made.Reader, John. Africa: A Biography of the Continent Although Barotseland was incorporated into Northern Rhodesia, it retained a large degree of autonomy, which was carried over when Northern Rhodesia became Zambia on its independence in 1964. In the run-up to independence, the Litunga, the Ngambela (Prime Minister) and about a dozen senior indunas went to London for talks with the Colonial Office, in an attempt to have Barotseland remain a Protectorate.http://www.spanglefish.com/gervasclay The Litunga, Sir Mwanawina Lewenika III, quoted his grandfather's words to Queen Victoria, that \\"My country is your blanket, and my people are but the fleas in your blanket.\\" Although before colonial times, the region was self-sufficient in food and exported crops to neighbouring regions, today it is the least- developed region of Zambia, with only one major road into the province, from Lusaka to Mongu, and only intermittent supplies of electricity. There remains some support in the region for greater autonomy within Zambia or for full independence. It is clear that history does not clearly state where the Lozi people may have originally came from. Culture Musical instruments 1870s Barotse handkiss Lozi society is highly stratified, with a monarch at the top and those of recent royal descent occupying high positions in society. The monarch or Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE) is known as Mulonga, and Lozi society tolerates little criticism even of an unpopular Litunga. Criticisms of a Litunga by a foreigner are treated as criticisms of the Lozi nation as a whole. The Lozi are not separate into clans, unlike most African ethnic groups. Lozi culture is strongly influenced by the flood cycle of the Zambezi river, with annual migrations taking place from the flood plain to higher ground at the start of the wet season. The most important of these festivals is the Kuomboka, in which the Litunga moves from Lealui in the flood plain to Limulunga on higher ground. The Kuomboka usually takes place in February or March. These annual floods displace hundreds of people every year.

It is the homeland of the Lozi people or Barotse,The prefixes \\"Ma-\\" (singular) or \\"Ba-\\" (plural) indicate \\"a man / the people/tribe of\\"; \\"Lozi\\" or \\"-rotse\\" are different interpretations/spellings of the same word. \\"Si-\\" indicates the language. or Malozi, who are a unified group of over 20 individual formerly diverse tribes related through kinship, whose original branch are the Luyi (Maluyi), and also assimilated Southern Sotho tribe of South Africa known as the Makololo. The Barotse speak Silozi, a language most closely related to Sesotho. Barotseland covers an area of 126,386 square kilometres, but is estimated to have been twice as large at certain points in its history. Once an empire, the Kingdom stretched into Namibia and Angola and included other parts of Zambia, including its central Copperbelt Province, south-west of the Democratic Republic of Congo's Katanga Province. Under the British colonial administration, Barotseland was a Protectorate of the British Crown from the late 19th-century. The Litunga, the Lozi word for the king of Barotseland, had negotiated agreements, first with the British South African Company (BSAC), and then with the British government that ensured the kingdom maintained much of its traditional authority according to the Litunga. Barotseland was essentially a nation-state, a protectorate within the larger protectorate of Northern Rhodesia. In return for this protectorate status, the Litunga gave the BSAC mineral exploration rights in Barotseland. In 1964, Barotseland became part of Zambia when that country achieved independence. However, some people claim that Zambia has violated the Barotseland Agreement 1964, and seek independence from Zambia. In 2012, a group of traditional Lozi leaders, calling itself the Barotseland National Council, called for independence; other tribal chieftains oppose secession, however.  Geography  Map showing the principal towns of Barotseland Its heartland is the Barotse Floodplain on the upper Zambezi River, also known as Bulozi or Lyondo, but it includes the surrounding higher ground of the plateau comprising all of what was the Western Province of Zambia. In pre-colonial times, Barotseland included some neighbouring parts of what are now the Northwestern, Central and Southern Province as well as Caprivi in northeastern Namibia and parts of southeastern Angola beyond the Cuando or Mashi River.  History  = Origins = Before the advent of European explorers such as David Livingstone the Barotse had no written history, so the history was passed down by word of mouth. It is believed that the Barotse state was founded by Queen Mbuywamwambwa, the Lozi matriarch, over 500 years ago. Its people were migrants from the Congo. Other ethnic groupings that constitute the current Barotse kingdom migrated from South Africa, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Congo. The Barotse (the Lozi) reached the Zambezi River in the 17th century and their kingdom grew until it comprised some 25 peoples from Southern Rhodesia to the Congo and from Angola to the Kafue River. At the time, Barotseland was already a monarchy, when Lealui and Limulunga were seasonal capitals of the Lozi kings. A detailed investigation into the history of the Barotse was carried out in 1939 in connection with the Balovale Dispute, see below. In 1845 Barotseland had been conquered by the Makalolo (Kololo) from Lesotho ‚Äì which is why the Barotse language, Silozi, is a variant of Sesotho. The Makololo were in power when Livingstone visited Barotseland, but after thirty years the Luyi successfully overthrew the Kololo king. = British colonisation = Sipopa Lutangu, king of the Lozi people in 1864‚Äì1876 Barotseland's status at the onset of the colonial era differed from the other regions which became Zambia. It was the first territory north of the Zambezi to sign a minerals concession and protectorate agreement with the British South Africa Company (BSAC) of Cecil Rhodes. This was prompted by Lewanika's fears of an invasion by the Matebele under Lobengula. Mwanawina II, king of the Lozi people in 1876‚Äì1878 By 1880, the kingdom was stabilised and King Lewanika signed a treaty on 26 June 1889 to provide the kingdom international recognition as a State. After the discovery of diamonds, King Lewanika began trading with Europe. The first trade concession was signed on 27 June 1889 with Harry Ware, in return King Lewanika and his kingdom were to be protected. Ware transferred his concession to Cecil Rhodes of the British South Africa Company. Seeking the improvement of the military protection and with the intention to sign a treaty with the British Government, King Lewanika signed on 26 June 1890 the Lochner concession putting Barotseland under the protection of the British South Africa Company. At that time, there was European administration in Southern Rhodesia, in Nyasaland further East, and the beginnings of European administration in what was then called North-Eastern Rhodesia (centred on Fort Jameson, now Chipata) and also North-Western Rhodesia - basically Barotseland. Later, these two were administratively combined as simply \\"Northern Rhodesia\\", later divided up in five Provinces and Barotseland, which was treated slightly differently from the rest. Later Lewanika protested to London and to Queen Victoria that the BSAC agents had misrepresented the terms of the concession,Lewanika wrote to Queen Victoria, \\"My country is your blanket, and my people are the fleas in that blanket.\\" but his protests fell on deaf ears, and in 1899 the United Kingdom proclaimed a protectorate and governed it as part of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia.Camerapix: \\"Spectrum Guide to Zambia.\\" Camerapix International Publishing, Nairobi, 1996. = Balovale Dispute = In the 1930s, there was trouble between the Barotse and the Balovale and Balunda tribes who occupied the land to the north of the land occupied by the Barotse. The Barotse claimed that these were vassal tribes, while they claimed that they were not. Eventually, the Government set up a Commission to adjudicate, and the Barotse lost. = Barotseland Agreement 1964 = On 18 May 1964, the Litunga and Kenneth Kaunda Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia signed the \\"Barotseland Agreement 1964\\" which established Barotseland's position within Zambia in place of the earlier agreement between Barotseland and the British Government. The agreement was based on a long history of close social, economic and political interactions, but granted significant continued autonomy to Barotseland. The Barotseland Agreement granted Barotse authorities local self-governance rights and rights to be consulted on specified matters, including over land, natural resources and local government. It also established the Litunga of Barotseland as \\"the principal local authority for the government and administration of Barotseland\\", that he would remain in control of the \\"Barotse Native Government\\", the \\"Barotse Native Authorities\\", the courts known as the \\"Barotse Native Courts\\", \\"matters relating to local government\\", \\"land\\", \\"forests\\", \\"fishing\\", \\"control of hunting\\", \\"game preservation\\", the \\"Barotse native treasury\\", the supply of beer and \\"local taxation\\". There was also to be no appeal from Barotseland's courts to the courts of Zambia. Within a year of taking office as president of the newly independent Zambia on 24 October 1964, President Kenneth Kaunda began to introduce various acts that abrogated most of the powers allotted to Barotseland under the agreement. Notably, the Local Government Act of 1965 abolished the traditional institutions that had governed Barotseland and brought the kingdom under the administration of a uniform local government system. Then in 1969, the Zambian Parliament passed the Constitutional Amendment Act, annulling the Barotseland Agreement of 1964. Later that year the government changed Barotseland's name to Western Province and announced that all provinces would be treated \\"equally\\". The agreement's dissolution and the stubbornness of successive governments in ignoring repeated calls to restore it have fuelled the region's ongoing tension. One of the reasons why Kenneth Kaunda \\"revoked\\" the United Kingdom's Zambia Independence Act is reported to be that it called for the continuation of Barotseland. Barotseland independentists continued to lobby to be treated as a separate state and was given substantial autonomy within the later states, Northern Rhodesia and independent Zambia. At the pre-Independence talks, the Barotse simply asked for a continuation of \\"Queen Victoria's protection\\". = Post-colonial era = A desire to secede was expressed from time to time, causing some friction with the government of Kenneth Kaunda, reflected in Kaunda changing the name from Barotseland Province to Western Province, and subsequently tearing up the 1964 Agreement. According to Barotse activists' views, the government in Lusaka also starved Barotseland of development ‚Äì it has only one tarred road into the centre, from Lusaka to the provincial capital of Mongu, and lacks the kind of state infrastructure projects found in other provinces. Electricity supplies are erratic, relying on an ageing connectionAfrican languages in general do not have a word for \\"maintenance\\" to the hydroelectric plant at Kariba. Consequently, secessionist views are still aired from time to time. = 1993 Zambian High Court judgment = In an effort to solve the Barotseland issue within the legal framework the Republic of Zambia, His Majesty King Ilute Yeta III, took the matter to the High Court of Zambia, in which he sought for an interpretation of Article 4 and 8 of the Barotseland Agreement. On behalf of the Republic of Zambia, by then Attorney General, Mwelwa Chibesakunda, in the High Court clearly stated that the Barotseland Agreement was abrogated and terminated. On 4 December 1991, in a landmark Ruling, the High Court of Zambia ruled that the Barotseland Agreement 1964 was abrogated, and no longer exists. According to Bartose independentists, the judgmenthttp://barotsepost.com/‚Ä¶/1991_judgement_between_barotseland‚Ä¶ showed that the Zambian Government violated and rendered the Barotseland Agreement null and void. This clearly meant that there is no relationship between the two nations and there is nothing people can do to mend the broken relationship between Zambia and Barotseland, because the High Court had clearly stated that the Barotseland Agreement was terminated by introducing amendments to the laws. What remains now is an act of illegal occupation; Zambia has terminated the agreement and yet continues to enjoy the privileges and rights contained in the Barotseland Agreement. Pro-independence news website The Barotseland Post claimed that dissatisfaction grew. = 2012 call for independence = In 2012, a Barotseland National Council accepted Zambia's abrogation of the Barotseland Agreement 1964, alleging to terminate the treaty by which Barotseland initially joined Zambia. In 2013, Barotseland became a member of the UNPO, the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, joining Tibet and Taiwan at this international organisation dedicated to giving a voice to peoples who are currently unrepresented at the United Nations. Many modern States, including Estonia, Latvia, Armenia and East Timor, were former members of the UNPO. Due to continuing human rights violations on the part of Zambia, in 2013 the Barotseland National Freedom Alliance also petitioned the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in Banjul to examine Zambia's violations. This matter is currently being examined by the commission.  Politics  = Institutions = The Royal Standard of Barotseland The national flag of Barotseland has a red field and a white stripe The traditional constitutional monarchy of Barotseland has Nilotic origins with the kingdom originally divided into north and south. The north being ruled by a man, the King, called the Litunga meaning \\"keeper\\" or \\"guardian of the earth\\", and the south is ruled by a woman, Litunga la Mboela or Mulena Makwai, \\"Queen of the south\\". Both are allegedly directly descended from the ancient Litunga Mulambwa who ruled at the turn of the nineteenth century and through his grandson, Litunga Lewanika who ruled from 1878‚Äì1916, with one break in 1884‚Äì1885, who restored the traditions of the Lozi political economy in the arena of the invasion by the Makololo, internal competition, external threats such as that posed by the Matabele and the spread of European colonialism. The government of Barotseland is the Kuta, presided over by the Ngambela (Prime Minister). = Current situation = Activists claim Barotseland is now theoretically independent from Zambia, on the basis of the Zambian High Court ruling (see below) that the 1964 Agreement was unilaterally abrogated by Zambia as being null and void (see above) ‚Äì i.e., Zambia washed its hands of Barotseland, which therefore reverted to the situation that existed before Zambian Independence; i.e. that Barotseland remains a Protectorate of Great Britain. However, Britain does not want to get involved. = Political parties = In the 1962 elections, the Barotse National Party was established to contest the two Barotseland districts, as part of an electoral alliance with the United Federal Party. In both districts, the BNP candidate heavily lost to the UNIP candidate.Robert Rotberg, \\"Inconclusive Election in Northern Rhodesia.\\" Africa Report, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Dec., 1962) Currently, there are three groups who claim to represent Barotseland. In January 2012, The president of Zambia, Mr. Michael Sata met the representatives of the three groups at the Zambian State House in Lusaka. The groups are Linyungandambo, Barotse Freedom Movement (BFM) and the Movement for the Restoration of Barotseland. Experts have said that these three groups may become political parties should Barotseland gain independence. Fighting between the three groups has already surfaced. An article which appeared on the Zambian Watchdog purported to be authored by a BFM representative condemned the activities of Linyungandambo group. The BFM accused the Linyungandambo of having set up Barotseland Government portal website without consultations, and included BFM members in the purported Barotseland Government without their consents, and in disregard of the effort being made by Mr. Sata to find a lasting solution. The author, Mr. Shuwanga Shuwanga went on to also reveal how the Linyungandambo had refused to work with the BFM back in 2011. The various activist groups championing the self-determination of Barotseland have since formed one umbrella organisation called the Barotse National Freedom Alliance (BNFA) which is headed by the former Ngambela of Barotseland Clement W. Sinyinda.  Public protests and demonstrations  =2010= Two protesters were shot and killed when police opened fire on a crowd in Mongu, Western Province. A previously unknown group the Barotse Freedom Movement (BFM) organised the protest to raise awareness about the need to restore the 1964 Barotse Agreement. Police immediately moved in as protesters gathered in the morning for the protest and dispersed the gathering saying it is illegal. =2011= On 14 January 2011, thousands of Mongu residents in Western Province most of them youths rioted demanding the restoration of the Barotseland Agreement of 1964.

Memorial in N√≥lsoy in memory of Ove Joensen Ove Joensen (3 December 1948 ‚Äì 26 November 1987The date of the recovery of his body, and as shown on his grave marker) was a Faroese seaman and adventurer, the first to row from the Faroe Islands to Denmark. Early life Ove Joensen, born in 1948 in T√≥rshavn, Faroe Islands, was the son of a fisherman and after moving to the Island of N√≥lsoy had a seafarering career. Ocean crossing In 1984, inspired by Colin Quincey, the first man to row across the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia, he built his 30-foot boat Diana Victoria at N√≥lsoy, to row the from the Faroes to Copenhagen in Denmark. On his first attempt later that year the boat was damaged when visiting a ship. Diverting to the Shetland Islands, he was towed in from Eshaness by the Aith lifeboat. The following year Joensen's attempt was defeated by adverse winds after he had again reached Aith. Joensen finally succeeded in 1986, when he arrived in Copenhagen on 11 August 1986 after 41 days rowing alone. Thousands of people greeted him, both in the Danish capital and on his return to N√≥lsoy. The Danes called him Ro-Ove (Row- Ove).

Nubra Valley Nubra is a subdivision and a tehsil in the Indian union territory of Ladakh. Its inhabited areas form a tri-armed valley cut by the Nubra and Shyok rivers. Its Tibetan name Ldumra means \\"the valley of flowers\\". Demands have been raised and BJP has hinted at creation of Nubra as a new district.3,000 Demonstrate for Separate District in Sub-Zero Temperatures at Kargil, The Wire, 06/FEB/2020. Diskit, the headquarters of Nubra, is about 150 km north from Leh, the capital of Ladakh. The Shyok River meets the Nubra or Siachan River to form a large valley that separates the Ladakh and Karakoram Ranges. The Shyok river is a tributary of the Indus river. The average altitude of the valley is about 10,000 ft. i.e. 3048 metres above the sea level. The common way to access this valley is to travel over the Khardung La pass from Leh town. Foreign nationals are required to get a Protected area permit to visit the Nubra Valley. Since 1 April 2017 Indian citizens are also required to get an Inner Line Permit to visit the valley.Do You Need Inner Line Permit for Nubra, Pangong, Tso Moriri?, The Off: About Best Himalayan Adventures (TO ABHA), 26 April 2017.  Transport  The main road access to the Nubra Valley is over Khardung La pass which is open throughout the year. Its status as the highest motorable road in the world is no longer accepted by most authorities. An alternative route, opened in 2008, crosses the Wari La from Sakti, to the east of Khardung La, connecting to the main Nubra road system via Agham and Khalsar along the Shyok River. There are also trekkable passes over the Ladakh Range from the Indus Valley at various points. Routes from Nubra to Baltistan and Yarkand, though historically important, have been closed since 1947 and 1950 respectively.  Geography  =Topography= Like the rest of the Tibetan Plateau, Nubra is a high altitude cold desert with rare precipitation and scant vegetation except along river beds. The villages are irrigated and fertile, producing wheat, barley, peas, mustard and a variety of fruits and nuts, including blood apples, walnuts, apricots and even a few almond trees. Most of the Nubra Valley is inhabited by Nubra dialect or Nubra Skat speakers. The majority are Buddhists. In the western or lowest altitude end of Nubra Valley near the Line of Control i.e. the Indo-Pak border, along the Shyok River, the inhabitants in village turtuk are Balti of Gilgit-Baltistan, who speak Balti, and are Shia and Sufia Nurbakhshia Muslims. Siachen Glacier lies to the north of the valley. The Sasser Pass and the famous Karakoram Pass lie to the northwest of the valley and connect Nubra with Uyghur (Mandarin : Xinjiang). Previously there was much trade passing through the area with western China's Xinjiang and Central Asia. The people of Baltistan also used the Nubra valley for passage to Tibet.Senge H. Sering, ‚ÄúReclaiming Nubra‚Äù ‚Äì Locals Shunning Pakistani Influences, Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, Delhi, 17 August 2009. = Places = Tourists riding Bactrian camels in Hundar Diskit town in the valley have become the congregation centre for people of the region. Diskit is the headquarters of the Nubra Valley and thus has lot of government offices with basic facilities. It is also connected by road with Leh. Along the Nubra or Siachan River lie the villages of Sumur, Kyagar (called Tiger Hill by the Indian Army), Tirith, Panamik, Turtuk and many others.  Tourism  Sand Dunes of Nubra valley. The Nubra valley was open for tourists up to Hunder (the land of sand dunes) until 2010. The region beyond Hunder gives way to a greener region of Ladakh because of its lower altitude. The village of Turtuk which was unseen by tourists till 2010 is a virgin destination for people who seek peace and an interaction with a tribal community of Ladakh. The village is stuffed with apricot trees and children. The local tribe, Balti people, follows its age old customs in their lifestyle and speak a language which is just spoken and not written. For tourists Turtuk offers serene camping sites with environment friendly infrastructure. Panamik is noted for its hot springs. Between Hundar and Diskit lie several kilometres of sand dunes, and (two-humped) Bactrian camels graze in the neighbouring \\"forests\\" of seabuckthorn. Non-locals are not allowed below Hundar village into the Balti area, as it is a border area. = Monasteries = The 32 metre Maitreya Buddha statue is the landmark of Nubra Valley and is maintained by the Diskit Monastery. On the Shyok (pronounced Shayok) River, the main village, Diskit, is home to the dramatically positioned Diskit Monastery which is built in 1420 AD. Hundar was the capital of the erstwhile Nubra kingdom in the 17th century, and is home to the Chamba Gompa. Ganden Sumtseling Monastery is between Kyagar and Sumur villages. Across the Nubra or Siachan River at Panamik, is the isolated Ensa Gompa near Warisfistan village. =Flora and fauna = The valley is famous for its forest of Hippophae shrub, popularly known as Leh Berry. It is within this shrub forest that one can spot the white-browed tit-warbler. One can also spot the Tibetan lark, Hume's short- toed lark, and Hume's whitethroat. The various water birds like ruddy shelduck, garganey, northern pintail, and mallard can be observed on several small water bodies scattered along the route. Besides these, waders like black-tailed godwit, common sandpiper, common greenshank, common redshank, green sandpiper, and ruff can be spotted in Nubra.  Education  The valley has been secluded as has been most of the exterior parts of Ladakh. Almost all of the region has been facing problems to get good quality education. There have been initiatives in the past by the government but extreme weather conditions and vicinity to the borders have been a major hurdle in implementing a solid education base. There is also migration of the population that gets exposed to the big cities of India and hence the people do not get benefitted out of their local learned population. There are very few Non- Government organizations active in Nubra region. A national NGO karmabhoomi works for the education and employment generation in the Turtuk region with an intention to cover the whole of Ladakh in future.

In today's Zambia it is applied to a traditional ceremony that takes place at the end of the rain season, when the upper Zambezi River floods the plains of the Western Province. The festival celebrates the move of the Litunga, king of the Lozi people, from his compound at Lealui in the Barotse Floodplain of the Zambezi River to Limulunga on higher ground.  History  Historians claim that before the time of the first known male Lozi chief Mboo, there came a great flood called Meyi-a-Lungwangwa meaning \\"the waters that swallowed everything.\\" The vast plain was covered in the deluge, all animals died and every farm was swept away. People were afraid to escape the flood in their little dugout canoes. So it was that the high god, Nyambe, ordered a man called Nakambela to build the first great canoe, Nalikwanda, which means \\"for the people,\\" to escape the flood. Thus the start of what is known today as the Kuomboka ceremony.  The Procession  The ceremony is preceded by heavy drumming of the royal Maoma drums, which echoes around the royal capital the day before Kuomboka, announcing the event. The Litunga begins the day in traditional dress, but during the journey changes into the full uniform of a British admiral that was presented to the Litunga in 1902 by King Edward VII, in recognition of treaties signed between the Lozi people and Queen Victoria. The ceremony is attended by hundreds of people each year. The ceremony begins with two white scout canoes that are sent to check the depth of the water and for the presence of any enemies. Once the scouts signal the ‚Äòall clear‚Äô, the journey to the highland begins. The Litunga‚Äôs royal boat is followed by another boat for his wife and another for the Prime Minister. The journey to Limulunga normally takes about 6-8 hours. Drums beat throughout to coordinate and energise those paddling the barge. The most important are the three royal war drums - kanaona, munanga and mundili - each more than one-metre wide and said to be at least 170 years old. The Litunga is accompanied on the journey by his Prime Minister and other local area chiefs known as the Indunas. The King's state barge is called Nalikwanda and is painted black and white, like Zambia's coat of arms. On the barge is a replica of a huge black elephant, the ears of which can be moved from inside the barge. There is also a fire on board, the smoke from which tells the people that the king is alive and well. The Nalikwanda is large enough to carry his possessions, his attendants, his musicians, his 100 paddlers. It is considered a great honour to be one of the hundred or so paddlers on the nalikwanda and each paddler wears a headdress of a scarlet beret with a piece of a lion‚Äôs mane and a knee-length skirt of animal skins. For his wife there is a second barge. This one has a huge cattle egret (Nalwange) on top. The wings move like the ears of the elephant, up and down.

Once the Philosopher's stone or powder of projection had been created, the process of projection would be used to transmute a lesser substance into a higher form; often lead into gold. Typically, the process is described as casting a small portion of the Stone into a molten base metal. Claims and demonstrations The seventeenth century saw an increase in tales of physical transmutation and projection. These are variously explained as examples of charlatanism, fiction, pseudo-scientific error, or missed metaphor. The following is a typical account of the projection process described by Jan Baptista van Helmont in his De Natura Vitae Eternae.Rosemary Guiley. The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy. 2006. p.328 Other reports include: * Elias Ashmole's Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum lists an account of Edward Kelley making projections from lesser metals into both gold and silver.

A pet monkey is a monkey kept as a pet. Monkeys have often been favorite pets of queens such as Catherine de' Medici and Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I. Ship's monkeys When the British first began to explore Africa, young monkeys were often captured and taken back on board the ship to entertain sailors. For example, a Senegal monkey was kept as a pet by a ship's cook in the 19th century and entertained passengers with its antics. Some were later kept in zoos; many modern captive monkeys in the UK are descended from such Victorian-era monkeys. The same practice is thought to have occurred during the Napoleonic wars; it is rumored that such practices led to a monkey being washed ashore and hanged in Hartlepool, causing the people of Hartlepool to be nicknamed the Monkey Hangers. As service animals for the disabled Some organizations train capuchin monkeys as monkey helpers to assist quadriplegics and other people with severe spinal cord injuries or mobility impairments. After being socialized in a human home as infants, the monkeys undergo extensive training before being placed with a quadriplegic. Around the house, the monkeys help out by doing tasks such as microwaving food, washing the quadriplegic's face, and opening drink bottles. For safety and the possibility of learning through operant condition methods using positive punishment, the quadriplegics had the ability to deliver a warning tone or 0.5 second shock to the monkey. As with all primates, monkeys must never be fully trusted with a human life in an environment they find demanding or where their needs are not being attended to. In at least one study, the monkey completed all tasks and punishment was used only in the learning stage. Popular culture Mystic and spiritual master Meher Baba with his pet monkey named Lucky in India (circa 1940) The monkey had been given to him by Princess Norina Matchabelli. In popular culture both actual and fictionalized accounts of pet monkeys are utilized extensively. Monkeys are popular in numerous books, television programs, and movies. Sun Wukong (the \\"Monkey King\\"), a character who figures prominently in Chinese mythology, is the main protagonist in the classic comic Chinese novel Journey to the West. The television series Monkey, the literary characters Monsieur Eek and Curious George are all examples. The winged monkeys are prominent characters in The Wizard of Oz. However, pop culture often incorrectly labels apes, particularly chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans as monkeys. Terry Pratchett makes use of the distinction in his Discworld novels, in which the Librarian of the Unseen University is an orangutan who gets very violent if referred to as a monkey. =Famous pet monkeys= There have been many famous pet monkeys with Tarzan's Cheeta arguably the first famous pet \\"monkey\\" although they continued to live in the jungle. Nkima was the original Cheeta-like character in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan novels, and in adaptations of the saga to other media, particularly comics. Tarzan and Cheeta have been repeated across all major popular culture mediums including books, films, television, games and comics. Katie, a white-headed capuchin, played Marcel in the popular U.S. series Friends and also Los Angeles Angels' mascot \\"Rally Monkey.\\" Finster played Harvey Keitel's pet thief, Dodger in the movie Monkey Trouble. Bubbles was a companion to Michael Jackson and became intertwined in his celebrity and was even a subject of a Jeff Koons sculpture. Frankie the Monkey has been seen in Sean-Paul and Juliane's magic act all over the country. =Curious George= Curious George is the protagonist of a popular children's books franchise by the same name, written by Hans Augusto Rey and Margret Rey.Curious George . About the Program  PBS KIDS The books feature a curious pet monkey named George, who is brought from his home in Africa by \\"The Man with The Yellow Hat\\" to live with him in a big city. Around the world, the adventures of Curious George have been translated in many languages. The character has spawned books in many languages, two television series, two stop-motion animated shorts, an animated film, Curious George, featuring Will Ferrell, a video game and he has been linked with numerous products and companies. =List of fictional pet monkeys= ;Literature * Ampersand is the name of Yorick Brown's pet monkey in the comic book series, Y: The Last Man. * Chee- Chee is the pet companion of Doctor Dolittle, created by Hugh Lofting. * Francine Frensky is from the book series and PBS children's show Arthur * In A Little Princess, the heroine finds and returns Carrisford's pet monkey ;Cartoons * Abu is the pet in Disney's Aladdin * Beppo was Superman's pet monkey. * Bippy, a small monkey that accompanies Timmy Turner in the first Fairly Oddparents movie Abra-Catastrophe * Boots is the pet explorer in Dora the Explorer * Chim-Chim is the pet monkey of Speed Racer and his family * Mojo was Homer Simpson's helper monkey who eventually adopts Homer's unhealthy lifestyle and becomes very obese * Mr. Teeny on The Simpsons, is Krusty the Clown's assistant * So-So is the pet sidekick of Peter Potamus, from Hanna- Barbera. * Tenshin is a pet meilin in Ask Dr. Rin! ;Film * Dodger is the trained pickpocket monkey from Monkey Trouble (1994) * Bonzo is the pet chimpanzee that Ronald Reagan takes care of in Bedtime for Bonzo (1951) * Mona is the pet from Robinson Crusoe on Mars * Spike is Ace Ventura's monkey companion in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) and Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995). *Monkey is Dante's pet monkey in Grandma's Boy * Jack the Monkey is Captain Barbossa's pet capuchin monkey named after Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. * Caesar is Will Rodman's pet chimpanzee in Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) * The couple that John Cusack and Cameron Diaz's characters form in Being John Malkovich (1999) have a pet monkey. * Norma Desmond owns a chimpanzee prior to the beginning of Sunset Boulevard (1950).

Fish from the river provide most of the local diet, and some are exported to other parts of Zambia away from the river. The town has very beautiful Zambezi River water front and sandy beaches. The locals call it the Home of plenty. The Northern part has a very old royal village called Sangaulu which was first village of the Queen Mwambwa who founded Barotseland. 5 @‚Ç¨4 Geography Lukulu is at the north end of the Zambezi's Barotse Floodplain which at that point has not developed its full character, being narrower and less flat than it is further south. Every year between December and March, the river rises above the low banks of its main channel and spreads across the floodplain. There is a small pontoon ferry across the river, with a beach lying on the opposite bank of the main channel. Lukulu is also home to a hospital, two markets and several schools. The rough roads are the only problem which stops trade and tourists from reaching the town. Lukulu District Lukulu District, population 68,375, stretches across the north- eastern and north-central parts of Western Province, adjoining North-Western Province and straddling the Zambezi and the northern Barotse Floodplain. The portion of the district west of the Zambezi is grassland and has no roads or towns, only dry season tracks to a few villages. It is rich in wildlife, the Liuwa Plain National Park extends into it from the south. East of the river the district is Miombo woodland and Zambezian cryptosepalum dry forest with Zambezian flooded grasslands adjacent to rivers.

Early life Charlton was born in Fort Polk, LA, and graduated from James Madison High School in San Antonio, TX. He attended Rice University in Houston, Texas, playing for coach David Hall, before being drafted by the Montreal Expos with the 28th pick in the first round of the 1984 MLB June Amateur Draft. Professional playing career Charlton with the Nashville Sounds in 1987 The left-handed Charlton was best known as being part of the infamous \\"Nasty Boys\\" relief pitching corps for the Reds team who won the World Series. Randy Myers and Rob Dibble were the other two members. The Boys were renowned for their clutch, shutdown performances, particularly during the playoff run; their blazing fastballs; and their bruising beanballs. Charlton is also famous in Cincinnati for plowing over Mike Scioscia to score a run in a nationally televised Sunday night game. Charlton was also a key member of the two most beloved Mariner teams. During the 1995 \\"Refuse to Lose\\" team that was the first Mariner team to reach the playoffs, he was the team's closer after a midseason trade. As a member of the 2001 team that won an MLB record 116 games, Charlton was a lefty specialist, fleshing out a bullpen which also featured Japanese closer Kazuhiro Sasaki, Jeff Nelson, and fellow lefty Arthur Rhodes.

Vladimir Andreyevich the Bold () (July 15, 1353 ‚Äì 1410) was the most famous prince of Serpukhov. His moniker alludes to his many military exploits committed in the wars waged by his cousin, Dmitri Donskoi of Moscow.  Biography  A grandson of Ivan Kalita, Vladimir inherited Serpukhov, Borovsk, and a third part of Moscow from his brother at the age of 5. As his cousin Dmitry of Moscow was also a child, both princes had to be tutored by the Metropolitan Alexis who arranged a treaty stipulating Vladimir's loyalty to his Muscovite cousin. Pursuant to the treaty, Vladimir helped Dmitry to fight Tver (1375), Ryazan (1385), the Livonian Knights (1379), and the Republic of Novgorod (1392). Although he married a daughter of Algirdas of Lithuania in 1371, Vladimir still loyally supported Dmitry in his struggle against the Lithuanians. In 1374, anxious to defend his capital, Vladimir built the first oaken kremlin in Serpukhov. In 1377, Vladimir sacked the Severian towns of Trubchevsk and Starodub. In the great Battle of Kulikovo (1380) Vladimir commanded cavalry which decided the Russian victory. When Tokhtamysh invaded Russia two years later, Vladimir defeated his force near Volokolamsk. It is not clear why Vladimir quarrelled with his cousin in 1388. Although they made peace the same year, Vladimir was forced to leave Serpukhov for Torzhok following Dmitry's death and enthronement of his son Vasily I. A year later, he returned to Serpukhov and concluded a treaty with Vasily, whereby he obtained the appanage towns of Volokolamsk and Rzhev. Later, he exchanged these towns for Gorodets, Uglich, and Kozelsk, while forfeiting his claims to Murom and Tarusa. Vladimir's last military campaign was to defend Moscow against the horde of Edigu in 1408. He died two years later and was interred in the Archangel Cathedral. His seven sons continued the lineage of Serpukhov princes until 1456. His granddaughter Maria of Borovsk married Vasily II and gave birth to Ivan the Great, who expelled the last princes of Serpukhov to Lithuania. The last of Vladimir's male-line descendants died in 1521.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Brinsford was opened in 1991 as a YOI and Remand Centre. The site had been previously acquired from the Ministry of Defence, and already housed Featherstone Prison. In 2001, Brinsford was branded a disgrace after an inspection found the prison's regime to be negligent and lacking in understanding towards prisoners, with large indicators of self harm, fear of safety and bullying at the prison. A year later two additional education blocks were built at Brinsford, with the regime promising a renewed focus on education and training at the site. In 2003, four prisoners escaped from Brinsford after assaulting a prison officer and stealing his keys to an administration block. The four inmates then smashed a window and escaped over the prison's perimeter wall. In 2008, an additional residential unit and activity centre were built at Brinsford. This resulted in a reduction of places for Juveniles, and an increase in places for Young Offenders at the prison. In 2016, it was in the process of changing to a Category C male prison. Since the beginning of 2019, it became a Category B & C male prison, mainly due to the rise in violence, self-harm and drug abuse, it has been named as one of the worst prisons in the United Kingdom. The prison today Brinsford holds young offenders and adults (those aged over 18).

The report found that the prison failed at inducting new inmates to the regime, that the level of violence was \\"too high\\", that a quarter of inmates surveyed said that it was easy to get drugs into prison. The report also found that many cells were \\"squalid\\" in condition and that communal areas were \\"dirty and in need of refurbishment\\". The inspectorate found that just under a third of the inmates were not engaged with either work or education programmes.

The tribes in this region are now known as Lozi, and although the Kololo were overthrown, their language remains. The Kololo or Makololo are a subgroup of the Sotho-Tswana people native to Southern Africa. In the early 19th century, they were displaced by the Zulu, migrating north to Barotseland, Zambia. They conquered the territory of the Luyana people and imposed their own language. The combination of Luyana and Kololo languages gave rise to the current Lozi language spoken by the Lozi people, descendants of the Luyana and nearby tribes. In 1864, the Kololo kingdom was overthrown and some chiefs moved to Chikwawa District, Malawi, with David Livingstone. Name The Kololo are also known as Makololo. When referring to Kololo people in plural, their endonym is Bakololo, which includes the Bantu clitic ba-. The Kololo appear to be named after Kololo, the wife of their first chief, Sebitwane. Another theory is that it is a Luyana word meaning \\"bald\\" referring to their conqueror's hairstyles. History They originated in the North Orange Free State region (current Free State province of South Africa), whence they were displaced by the Zulu expansion under Shaka in the early 19th century. In 1823, the Kololo started a migration north through Botswana to Barotseland. In what is now southern Botswana they defeated a number of societies before suffering a catastrophic defeat to the Bangwaketse at Dithubaruba in 1826.J. Ramsay, B. Morton, and T. Mgadla, Building a Nation: A History of Botswana from 1800 to 1910. Gaborone: Longmans, 1996, 66-8. After losing all their cattle they moved north east and raided again, but subsequent defeats led them north to Okavango Delta where they again suffered major losses but were able to defeat the Batawana people in 1835. This victory enabled them to replenish their population and cattle holdings, although they moved north after several years.Moanaphuti Segolodi, \\"Ditso Tsa Batawana,\\" 1940. https://www.academia.edu/12170767/Ditso_Tsa_Batawana_by_Moanaphuti_Segolodi_1940 In 1838, the Makololo leader, Sebetwane crossed the Zambezi River and, by 1845, he had conquered the Lozi people of the Barotseland kingdom and became king. He died in 1851 shortly after meeting David Livingstone, and was succeeded, first, by his daughter Mamochisane, who soon abdicated in favour of her younger half-brother Sekeletu.N. R. Bennett, (1970). David Livingstone: Exploration for Christianity in R. I. Rotberg (editor), Africa and its Explorers. Harvard University Press, p.42. After about 20 years the Makololo kingdom was overthrown in a revolution, although some survivors (women and children) remained, Sekeletu provided Livingstone with manu porters for his transcontinental journey from Luanda on the Atlantic to Quelimane on the Indian Ocean, made between 1854 and 1856. Around 100 of these men were left at Tete in 1856 when Livingstone made his way to Quelimane and then to Britain.T. Jeal, (2013). Livingstone: Revised and Expanded Edition, Yale University Press, pp. 93, 103‚Äì105. Livingstone returned to Africa to start his second Zambezi expedition in 1858. On reaching Tete, he was reunited with the porters he left there in 1856 and attempted to repatriate them all to Barotseland. However, by this time Sekeletu was facing increasing opposition from the Lozi majority, and around 16 of them decided to remain on the middle Zambezi.J. McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, Woodbridge, James Currey, pp. 39-41. Those Makololo remaining were used from 1859 onward, by Livingstone and by missionaries of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), as porters and armed guards to support their activities in the Shire valley and Shire Highlands including the freeing of slaves, and were paid in guns, ammunition and cloth. The Makololo decided to remain in the Shire valley when the missionaries left in January 1864.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, Cambridge University Press, pp. 17, 39, 64-7. After the 1864 departure of the UMCA mission, which left behind supplies of arms and ammunition, the Makololo maintained themselves by hunting elephants for ivory and attracted dependents seeking protection, many of whom were freed slaves. They and their armed dependents established chieftaincies in the present-day Chikwawa District. Originally, ten Makololo became chiefs or headmen and five Makololo chiefs still exist today.J.

It was founded in 1977 in Israel and acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2001 (over a decade before the technology giant split into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise). HP Indigo develops, manufactures and markets digital printing solutions, including printing presses, proprietary consumables/supplies and workflow solutions. HP Indigo has offices around the world, with headquarters in Ness Ziona, Israel. Indigo is known as a pioneer of digital printing technology. Digital printing refers to the ability to print without plates or other tooling processes, and has three major benefits: it makes short runs and personalized print cost-effective, it enables the use of variable data (such as text or images), and it makes just-in-time printing possible. As a result, digital presses have changed the economic models for printing in a wide variety of market segments, including labeling, packaging, marketing, as well as educational textbooks, journals and periodicals. These aspects are particularly important given the consolidation and diminishing profitability of traditional print segments, such as the decline of newspapers and magazines.https://www.printweek.com/print-week/news/1163651/print-continues- decline-in-latest-magazine-abcs Additionally, digital printing significantly reduces the waste of materials associated with pre-press, obsolescence and warehousing. Because a digital press is capable of printing a different image for each individual impression in its output stream, digital printing enables marketing campaigns to reach consumers in more creative and engaging ways. Examples include highly targeted advertisements, seasonal and limited editions of consumables, new product introductions, and individually personalized products. The HP Indigo printing process is known for matching offset lithography's print quality and its application versatility, with the ability to print on a wide range of materials. It uses a proprietary printing process called Liquid Electrophotography, or LEP for short, which is similar to the process used in laser printers, but with special electrostatically charged inks instead of toner, and without using a fuser, using instead a heated transfer roller to melt the charged ink particles before applying them to the paper. Up to seven inks, including the standard CMYK plus a wide range of spot colors and metallic colors, can be used simultaneously on a single press, thereby providing an extended color gamut. The user can also custom-mix, load, and interchange inks as desired. Inks can be laid down in any order desired, and multiple layers of each ink are also possible. On March 10th, 2020, HP announced a new speed-focused architecture for LEP called LEPx. This will comprise their sixth-generation of presses. The first press using LEPx, the HP Indigo V12 prints at 120 linear meters per minute, and is designed to have up to 12 ink stations on press. History =Early history= Indigo was the name of the company originally founded by Benny Landa in 1977. Landa, known as \\"the father of digital offset color printing,\\" was born in Poland to post- World War II Jewish refugee parents, who later immigrated to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The early years of Indigo were focused primarily on research and development. One of the earliest developments was a sheet cassette for copiers and other copier and printing-related equipment. The company's first product would be a digital plotter/duplicator, bringing the tiny company (its 1991 sales totaled less than US$5 million, generating a profit of $440,000) head-to-head with such industry giants as Xerox and Canon. The early 1990s brought a significant change in the company. In 1993, Indigo launched the E-Print 1000 at the IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing setup process by printing directly from a computer file, thereby simultaneously enabling inexpensive short-run color printing. Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed from page to page, requiring neither additional setup nor pauses in the print run. This was made possible by the Liquid Electrophotographic (LEP) process, which employed a high-speed laser scanner, along with a drum-shaped photoreceptor and charged, liquid toner (composed of pigment, resin, and carrier fluid) to produce the image. In 1994 Indigo had an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock exchange, selling 52 million shares at $20 per share and raising $100 million. At the drupa trade show in 1995, Indigo launched another product: the Omnius press. Whereas E-Print focused on medium-volume single-sheet printing, Omnius brought digital printing to a variety of surfaces, including plastic, cardboard, film, and, especially, cans, bottles, and other packaging surfaces. Omnius was the precursor of then became Indigo's portfolio of labels and packaging presses. At the end of 1995, Indigo sales did not reach the expected levels, and the company had to downsize. Despite a rise in revenues to $165 million, the company posted its fourth year of losses, of about $40 million. However, George Soros and other investors still believed in the company‚Äôs potential and increased his investment to 30 percent of Indigo's shares by 1997. By 1998, the company improved its product reliability and performance, and its revenues passed the $200 million mark for the first time. Hewlett- Packard offices in Ness Ziona =HP Acquisition= Starting in 1998, the Hewlett-Packard company began an evaluation of Indigo's technology and found it to be a superior fit to digital printing in commercial uses. In 2000, Hewlett-Packard made a $100m investment in Indigo, buying 14.8 million of Indigo's common shares, which represented 13.4 percent of the company's outstanding shares. On September 6, 2001, HP announced that it would acquire the remaining outstanding shares of Indigo N.V. (NASDAQ: INDG) for approximately $629 million in HP common stock and a potential future cash payment of up to $253 million contingent upon Indigo's achievement of long- term revenue goals, for an aggregate potential payment of up to $882 million. In the following years, HP continued to invest in Israel-based graphic arts companies, acquiring Scitex Visionhttp://www.piworld.com/article/hp-acquires- scitex-vision-16943/1# in 2005 and Nur Macroprinters in 2007.http://www.publish.com/c/a/Printing/HP-Buys-NUR-Macroprinters/ The combined presence of other employees of HP in Israel (which includes not only employees of the Indigo division, but also of Scitex and Israeli's divisions of HP Labs made HP the second-largest foreign employer after Intel. =Key milestones= Under the ownership of HP, Indigo developed and grew to become a world leader in the digital print industry. In 2002 they announced the first product developed jointly with staff drawn from HP: the HP Indigo 5000, which was the first model of their second generation of presses (known as \\"Series 2\\"). Other products belonging to Series 2 included the roll-fed ws4000 series and the sheetfed 5000 series (which included models such as the Indigo 5500, 5600 and the HP Indigo 5900) as well as the entry-level 3000 series. The last Series 2 press was manufactured in 2018. Launch of Series 3 (third generation presses) At drupa 2008, Indigo announced the Indigo 7000 digital press, which was noted for having a printing speed more than 70% faster than its series 2 predecessor. This product further pushed the break- even point versus offset lithography, thereby enabling more pages to be economically viable on Indigo. Other presses unveiled at drupa included the double-engine Indigo W7200 and the new derivative for labels, the Indigo WS6000. In September 2013, Indigo claimed dominance of the narrow label market, with General Manager Alon Bar-Shany calling the Indigo WS6600 press \\"the best-selling solution in the narrow web industry, not just in digital printing, (but) narrow overall.\\" At present (2019), the portfolio of Series 3 presses includes the HP Indigo 7900 (for commercial printing) and the HP Indigo 6900 (for narrow web labels and packaging.) In August 2009, HP announced that they had reached the milestone of 5,000 HP Indigo digital presses in operation around the world. In 2010, the trade magazine Print CEO ranked the company Number 1 in the US high-volume digital press market. HP Indigo was noted to have a 75% share of the world market for digital commercial photo printing.  Moving beyond SRA3 format: Fourth Generation presses  In March 2012, HP Indigo unveiled the HP Indigo 10000 B2/29\\" digital press, which is the fourth generation of the Indigo product portfolio, and released it to market a year later. This was the first press of their fourth generation of products, the first that went beyond the SRA3 size into oversized B2. By March 2016, when the company unveiled the Indigo 12000 (an updated version of the Indigo 10000), there were 200 Indigo 10000 customer installations in 20 countries. In February 2019, HP Indigo announced the one- thousandth installation of this the fourth generation presses. In 2014, HP Indigo began installing the HP Indigo 20000 and 30000 digital presses, aimed at the flexible packaging and folding carton markets, respectively. At drupa 2016, Indigo announced a new portfolio based on innovation that expanded four core pillars of their technology: quality, color, applications and productivity. They announced a new embellishment press (GEM) as well as double-speed narrow label press, the Indigo 8000.) The HP Indigo 12000 replaced the Indigo 10000 as the key press for commercial printing, and a new high-definition (HD) option for doubling the print resolution and supporting screen sets up to 290 lines per inch (LPI) became available. In addition, new models were also introduced for Series 3 presses.  March 2020: Fifth and Sixth Generations Announced  In March 2020, HP Indigo revealed its fifth and sixth generation of presses with the announcement of the HP Indigo 100K Digital Press and the HP Indigo V12 Digital Press, respectively. For label production, the HP Indigo V12 Digital Press is designed with next-generation HP Indigo LEPX architecture,and leverages the core power of Indigo‚Äôs Liquid Electrophotography (LEP) technology. The HP Indigo V12 offers up to 12 colors on press and achieves productivity performance that matches analog speed. The Indigo 100K B2/29\\" sheetfed press targets commercial printers and has a 30% speed increase over 4th generation Indigo B2 presses. HP Indigo announced another B2 press, the HP Indigo 15K as part of the portfolio. Other commercial presses announcedhttps://press.ext.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2020/hp- accelerates-digital-printing-b2-indigo-and-padewide-presses.html include the SRA3 HP Indigo 7K, the entry level 7eco and the B1 roll-to-sheet HP Indigo 90K. It also announced the revamp of its labels and packaging portfolio, announcinghttps://press.ext.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2020/hp-indigo- unviels-industry-leading-labels-and-packaging-portfolio-.html in addition to the Indigo V12, the new HP Indigo 35K for Folding Cartons, the Indigo 25K for flexible packaging, and the narrow web Indigo 6K and Indigo 8K Digital Presses for labels. PrintOS A key milestone for HP Graphic Arts at drupa 2016 was the introduction of PrintOS, a cloud-based technology to help customers oversee their presses, manage day-to-day production activities, and facilitate connectivity and business growth. It is available to HP Indigo customers, as well as users of other HP technologies like Designjet and PageWide Press. In March 2019, HP said that more than 20 thousand users were connected to PrintOS. Some of the applications available for PrintOS include Site Flow, Print Beat, Box, Composer and Marketplace. As part of the drupa 2020 portfolio, HP announced an update to the platform called PrintOSx designed to unite cloud-based applications with an AI-driven service and support infrastructure. Business Model HP Indigo relies on a mix of press sales, consumables and services for revenue. =Customers= Customers of HP Indigo solutions include commercial printers, photo specialty printers, as well as label, flexible packaging and folding-carton converters. They use Indigo presses to print a wide variety of applications including marketing collateral, photo albums, books, labels, heat-shrinkable sleeves (shrink sleeves) folding cartons, flexible packaging, direct mailers, manuals, and specialty jobs.https://www8.hp.com/il/en/commercial-printers/indigo- presses/applications.html Indigo customers include some of the largest names in both the commercial print world, such as Cimpress,http://www.proprint.com.au/News/389018,vistaprint-into-trade- printing.aspx Shutterfly, and Consolidated Graphics (now part of RR Donnelley),http://www.piworld.com/article/cgx-inks-deal-hp-fleet- indigos-108782/1 as well as in the labels and packaging print industry, such as CCL Industries and large digital newcomers such as ePac Flexible Packaging. However, most of its customer base is made up of a large variety of small and medium-sized commercial print-service providers. Notable deals from recent years include * A deal with Cimpress for \\"circa 20\\" next-generation Indigo presses, announced at drupa 2016.https://www.digitalprintermag.co.uk/news/28619/cimpress-signs-global- deal-for-a-fleet-of-hp-indigo-presses/ * The declaration of Shutterfly in 2016 and 2017 to purchase some 45 HP Indigo presses, replacing competitive equipment.https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3719643,00.html * The largest packaging deal to date signed with ePac Flexibles in 2018https://epacflexibles.com/hp-and-epac-announce-record-rollout-of-20-hp- indigo-digital-presses-to-transform-flexible-packaging-market/ The independent user's group of Indigo and HP Graphic Arts solutions, dscoop, was founded in 2005.

The presses are assembled in a dedicated facility in HP's Kiryat Gat campus, and the inks are manufactured at both Kiryat Gat, Israel, and TUAS, Singapore. In 2004 HP made a 100 million shekel investment in a new production site in Kiryat Gat to manufacture HP Indigo ElectroInk. There is a sister facility in Singapore that also manufactures Indigo ElectroInk. In 2007, an adjacent hardware center was opened in Kiryat Gat. This facility assembles frames, feeders, and other components with imaging engines into finished presses, and also serves as the site for manufacturing other operator-replaceable consumables. In late 2012, HP Indigo inaugurated a second ink plant in Kiryat Gat, which focuses on the manufacturing of ElectroInk for the fourth generation family of presses such as the Indigo 12000, Indigo 20000 and Indigo 30000. This 118,000 square feet facility was the first non-residential building in the country, and the first HP manufacturing facility worldwide, to be certified as meeting the LEED Silver environmental standard.http://www.labelsandlabeling.com/news/latest- news/hp-adds-new-ink-manufacturing-plant-in-israel In 2014, HP announced that it would expand its ElectroInk manufacturing plant in TUAS, Singapore, by 10 thousand square meters, in 2015.https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Hewlett- Packard-making-Singapore-a-digital-printer-ink-hub Awards * In 2016, HP Indigo and the digital press was selected as one of leading Israeli inventions that had a global-scale impact. It was showcased in an exhibition at Ben Gurion airport. Two commemorative postage stamps about digital printing were issued on the subject of \\"Israeli Achievements,\\" and one of them featured the image of an HP Indigo digital press. * In recognition as one of the country's top exporters, HP Indigo received the Outstanding Exporter Prize for 2016.https://www.gov.il/he/departments/news/outstanding_exporter_award_2016 * In 2018, HP Indigo received the Presidential Volunteer Medal (◊ê◊ï◊™ ◊î◊†◊©◊ô◊ê ◊ú◊û◊™◊†◊ì◊ë) for its activities in the non-profit sector.https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Volunteers-honored-for-service- inspiration-561050 Criticism Early incarnations of the press (Series 1 engines) were prone to banding and ink adhesion problems. However newer models have corrected these issues. The newer models also include inline scanners and other features for constant monitoring of output image quality. Due to the use of ethylene co-polymers used in the electroinks used by the Indigo printing process, there is some debate on the ability to recycle the print from Indigo presses.http://www.printmonthly.co.uk/News/Industry/2160/ingede-slams-hp- claims-over See also *Science and technology in Israel *Economy of Israel *HP Inc *Scitex *Hewlett-Packard References External links * HP Indigo * dscoop * PrintOS Category:Digital press Category:Hewlett-Packard acquisitions Category:Manufacturing companies of Israel ","title":"HP Indigo Division"},{"id":"2428702","text":"Old Trafford is an area of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, southwest of Manchester city centre, roughly delineated by the crossroads of two old toll gates, Brooks's Bar to the east and Trafford Bar tram stop to the west. Old Trafford is the site of Old Trafford football stadium, home of Manchester United F.C., and Old Trafford Cricket Ground, home of Lancashire County Cricket Club, on opposite ends of Brian Statham Way (formerly Warwick Road) and Sir Matt Busby Way (formerly Warwick Road North). The road between them retains the name Warwick Road, and the southern section on the other side of the Metrolink line is Warwick Road South. History Old Trafford was a crossing point over the River Irwell in ancient times. The name Old Trafford possibly derives from the time when there were two Trafford Halls, Old Trafford Hall and New Trafford Hall. The old hall was close to what is now the White City Retail Park, and was said to have been the home of the de Trafford family since 1017, until the family moved to the new hall in what is now Trafford Park, some time between 1672 and 1720. The name of the area around Old Trafford Hall may subsequently have become shortened to Old Trafford. The old hall was demolished in 1939. In the 1820s, Manchester scientist John Dalton chose Old Trafford as the site for a Royal Horticultural and Botanical Gardens because of its clean, unpolluted air, and so began the area's association with sports and recreation. The popularity of the botanical gardens, which was similar to The Crystal Palace, led wealthy people to build large houses in the area. In 1857, and again in 1887, the gardens staged exhibitions of art treasures, the former as part of the Art Treasures Exhibition and the latter in celebration of Queen Victoria's silver jubilee. The Hall√© Orchestra was formed to participate in the first of these exhibitions. The site of the botanical gardens was purchased by White City Limited in 1907, and it subsequently became an amusement park, although the name lives on in the street called Botanical Gardens. From the 1950s to the 1970s, White City Stadium was used as a greyhound racing track and for stock car racing. This site is now White City Retail Park. The front entrance is all that has been preserved of the old botanical gardens. Nearby, on the site of what is now the Greater Manchester Police Headquarters, was Henshaw's Institute for the Blind, which originally opened as Henshaw's Blind Asylum in 1837. Next door on the same site was the Royal Institute for the Deaf, where the film Mandy was made. Old Trafford expanded and became an urban area after the building of the Manchester Ship Canal in the 1890s, and the subsequent development of nearby Trafford Park Industrial Estate, in the early 20th century. Trafford Park provided employment for thousands of local residents. Employment was also provided on a smaller scale, notably by the railways (Trafford Park shed alone had over 300 staff), Duerr's Jams, Vimto, Arkady Soya Mill and Ludwig Oppenheimer Mosaics. The Royal Army Medical Corps and the Territorial Army have well-established bases in the area. Slum clearances during the 1960s and early 1970s saw some of the old Victorian housing stock demolished. However, after the perceived failure of the deck-access concrete crescents of Hulme, Old Trafford's residents preferred renovation to demolition. As a result, there are still many Victorian terraced streets in the area. By 1985, employment at Trafford Park had fallen to 24,500, as unemployment in the northwest soared above 30 per cent in some inner-city areas. Nearby Manchester Docks, which had also been a major source of local employment, closed in 1982. As the revitalised Salford Quays it has become an emblematic part of the regeneration of Manchester in general. Governance Old Trafford was formerly a hamlet in the township of Stretford. It was in the Municipal Borough of Stretford until 1974. In 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester. Since the realignment of Trafford's ward boundaries in 2004, Old Trafford has been divided between Clifford and Longford wards, with the larger part being in the former. Old Trafford is part of the parliamentary constituency of Stretford and Urmston. The current Member of Parliament is Kate Green of the Labour Party. In 2005, Trafford Council proposed to the Boundary Commission for England that the wards of Gorse Hill, Longford, and Clifford ‚Äì which includes Old Trafford ‚Äì should be moved into a new Salford and The Quays constituency, along with some other wards from Salford. At the subsequent public enquiry in November 2005, Beverley Hughes opposed the change, as well as an alternative proposal to create a constituency of Salford and Old Trafford. The Boundary Commission rejected Trafford Council's proposals, noting that there was \\"strong opposition to the creation of a constituency that crossed the Manchester Ship Canal and ... that the Canal provided a clearly identifiable boundary which should not be breached\\". Geography The area is unusual in effectively being a peninsula. Its northern boundary was the River Irwell, now canalised into the Manchester Ship Canal. To the east was a tributary of the Irwell, the Cornbrook. This was culverted as the area grew in the 19th century. In fact, Victorian Hulme and Old Trafford seemed indistinguishable, as the hidden river made its way out of sight. Similarly, the southern boundary was the Black Brook, which was culverted at about the same time as the Cornbrook. Thus Upper Chorlton Road, under which it flows, does not seem to be a natural boundary. Both sides of the road look similar, and Darley Park, on the Trafford side, could easily fit into Whalley Range. Some small anomalies due to the brook's underground route were not amended until the late 1980s. Similarly, the inter-war development of Firswood is almost indistinguishable from its Chorlton-cum-hardy neighbours. Old Trafford makes up the northern tip of Trafford and adjoins St. Georges, Hulme, Whalley Range and Moss Side ‚Äì all of which are within the boundaries of the City of Manchester ‚Äì and Ordsall to the northeast, which is within the boundaries of the City of Salford. At the crossroads of Brooks's Bar the boundaries between Old Trafford and Hulme, and Moss Side and Whalley Range meet. The boundary passed through the playground of Loreto College, as was famously illustrated by a photo of girls straddling the line, in the 1970s Nuffield O-Level Geography Textbook. On the western side of the area, the road named Seymour Grove has an interesting origin. In the 19th century, the people of Chorlton called it Trafford Road, and the people of Old Trafford called it Chorlton Road. Neither name was appropriate, as nearby roads already had those names. So the area's richest inhabitant, a millionaire grocer called Sir Thomas Seymour Mead, decided the road should be named after him. Landmarks Old Trafford Football Stadium, home of Manchester United F.C. Until the mid-20th century there were four cinemas in Old Trafford: the Imperial Picture Theatre in Chorlton Road, Brooks Bar, The Globe on Cornbrook Street, The Lyceum in City Road and the Trafford Picture House in Talbot Road. Three of the buildings have survived, although not now operated as cinemas. The Imperial opened in 1913, and for a brief period in the 1970s it became an Asian films cinema. It closed in 1979, and the building is now occupied by a timber and ironmongery business. The premises occupied by The Globe were originally part of the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company's horse-drawn tramway depot. The cinema closed in the mid 1960s, and is now used as a warehouse. The Lyceum opened in 1915, and it also closed in the 1960s. Its building is now used for private functions. The Trafford Picture House opened in 1922, and closed in 1958. After a period when it was used as a vehicle auction room the building became derelict, and it was demolished in 1997.Rendell, Cinemas of Trafford, pp. 57‚Äì60 Present day Today, Old Trafford has approximately residents. Cultural diversity has been a feature of the area for over a century. Irish immigrants settled in the locality from the 1880s, coming to Manchester to work on the ship canal. Polish and east European migrants arrived during and after the Second World War. The Afro- Caribbean community arrived and settled in the 1950s and 1960s. People from the Indian sub-continent started to arrive during the 1960s but settled in more significant numbers from the 1980s onwards. Old Trafford is among the 10% most deprived areas in England, suffering problems of unemployment, poor housing and low educational achievement. It also has levels of youth crime well above the national average. Ayres Road and its environs are the heart of modern-day Old Trafford and a walk down this road gives a real flavour of the multi-cultural nature of the neighbourhood, with its variety of grocers' shops selling food stuffs from Europe, the Caribbean and South-East Asia; its Catholic church, St. Alphonsus, frequented by a predominantly Irish congregation, the vibrant and busy St John's Community Centre and Shizhan House, the Chinese Medicine Centre, on the site of the old Vimto offices. Something of this atmosphere is evoked by Manchester poet Lemn Sissay in his poem Ayres Road. Religion and community Only 45% of the residents of Clifford ward (the ward that contains the larger part of Old Trafford) reported themselves as being Christian in the 2001 Census, compared to 76% across Trafford as a whole, and 72% across England. This is reflected in the unusually high number of non Christian places of worship in the area. Since the 1980s Old Trafford has become home to two large South Asian communities ‚Äì Punjabi Indians and Pakistani Urdu speakers ‚Äì almost all being Muslim. Muslims represent the largest non-Christian religious group in the area, with 28% of the population, compared to 3% in the whole of Trafford. To service this community there are four mosques in the area; the Faizan-e-Islam mosque, the Masjid-e-Hidayah, the Masjid-e-Noor and the Masjid Imdadia. There is also a smaller Sikh community, with its own Gurdwara, the Sangat Bhatra Sikh Temple, Upper Chorlton Road. Sikhs account for 4% of the area's population, significantly above the less than 1% average for Trafford and England. To further add to the religious mix there is also a Buddhist temple, the Fo Kang Shang Buddhist Temple, although Buddhists are recorded as making up only 0.2% of the area's population, roughly the same proportion as for Jews. The former library on Stretford Road has been converted into a Chinese Cultural Centre, and a Chinese Medical Centre is on Ayres Road. For many years the numerous Polish community had a focal point in their ex-servicemen's club on Shrewsbury Street, now no longer there. Old Trafford is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, and the Church of England Diocese of Manchester. Education Along with the rest of Trafford, Old Trafford maintains a selective education system assessed by the 11-plus examination. There is only one secondary school in Old Trafford; a private, female-only, Muslim secondary school but there are three primary schools within the area. Old Trafford Stadium Old Trafford Lancashire County Cricket Club Old Trafford has been the site of Manchester United Football Club's Old Trafford stadium since 1910. Lancashire County Cricket Club's ground, which is also known as Old Trafford, is close by. Before the club's formation, in 1864, it had been the home of Manchester Cricket Club, who had moved here in 1856. The ground of the Northern Lawn Tennis Club was in Old Trafford from 1882 to 1909 (near the cricket ground): this is commemorated in the name of Tennis Street. The move to West Didsbury in 1909 was prompted by the industrialisation of Trafford Park and consequent air pollution. The half-timbered pavilion was dismantled and re-erected at the new ground.Phythian, Graham (2010) \\"Looking Back\\", in: South Manchester Reporter; 13 May 2010, p. 22 Notable people Famous people who were born or lived in the area include political and social activist Sylvia Pankhurst, singer Ian Curtis of Joy Division and his wife, the author Deborah Curtis, artist L. S. Lowry, aviator John Alcock,Massey, A History of Stretford, p. 193 Dodie Smith, the author of 101 Dalmatians. Old Trafford also produced two Victoria Cross winners in the First World War: Charles Coverdale, a sergeant in the Manchester Regiment, and James Marshall, an officer in the Lancashire Fusiliers. Rebecca Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles and Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury was born in Trafford.

It is the second largest park in Africa and is home to over 55 different species of mammals. The park is named for the Kafue River. It stretches over three provinces: North Western, Central and Southern. The main access is via the Great West Road from Lusaka to Mongu which crosses the park north of its centre. Seasonal dirt roads also link from Kalomo and Namwala in the south and south-east, and Kasempa in the north. History Kafue National Park was established in 1924 after the British colonial government moved the traditional owners of the area, the Nkoya people of (King) Mwene Kabulwebulwe, from their traditional hunting grounds into the Mumbwa District to the east. Dissatisfaction with the pace of development in Central Province and a lack of benefit from tourism in the park have led to calls from Nkoya leaders to establish a new province in the area which they have proposed to call Kafue Province.Visit Zambia Campaign Fauna Roan Antelope in Kafue National Park Kafue has a superb range of antelopes as well as large herds of red lechwe and puku, with smaller groups of zebras and blue wildebeest in the Busanga Plains around June, when it starts to dry out. Across the northern half of the park, there's a good range of mixed bush environments. Kudus, bushbucks, elands, reedbucks, duikers, grysboks and defassa waterbucks are all frequently seen in Kafue. Lions are relatively widespread all over the park, but the larger males are increasingly uncommon, with inevitable consequences for numbers as a whole. Prides stalk through nervous herds of pukus and lechwes nightly, using the natural drainage ditches for cover with deadly efficiency on the Busanga Plains. The Kafue River and its tributaries themselves are a hive of activity and home to pods of hippopotami and a few of the largest crocodiles in southern Africa. Elephants are commonly seen particularly along the Kafue River and around Lake Itezhi-tezhi. Leopards remain very common throughout the main forested areas of this park, though they are seldom seen on the open plains. Spotted hyenas are seen regularly, though not often, throughout the park. Cheetahs are not common anywhere, but they are most frequently seen in the north of this park, where they seem to be thriving. Occasional sightings of Cape wild dogs occur all over the park which is one of Zambia's best strongholds for them. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with South Luangwa National Park.IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion Panthera leo in Eastern and Southern Africa. IUCN, Pretoria, South Africa. Physical environment The country is generally flat or gently undulating apart from some small, steep porphyritic granite hills between Chonga and Ngoma and occasional sandstone and granite hills around Ngoma rising to . The southwestern part of the Hook granite massif underlies the central part of the park, including schist, gneiss, granite gneiss and granite. On the edge of the granite massif there are slates, quartzites and limestones from the Katanga sediments of the inner Lufilian Arc. To the north and south of the massif the soil covers Karroo sediments of shales, siltstones, concreted gravels and various types of laterite. In the northern end of the park the flood plains have clay soils, but otherwise the soils are strongly leached sandy to loamy soils with low fertility. In most of the drainage of the Nanzila river, and in some of the lands around the Nkala, Musa and Lwansanza rivers, there are dark grey alkaline clays. Otherwise, the park is covered by well-drained and relatively infertile pale or orange Kalahari sands mixed with some silt and clay. Mean annual rainfall varies from in the south to more than in the north. The annual mean temperature is , with a mean maximum from in July to in October, the hottest month of the year. Winds are mostly light, blowing from the east. In November‚ÄìFebruary there are about 5 hours of sunshine daily, and in June‚ÄìSeptember about 9 hours of sunshine daily. Ecoregions and habitats Most of the park lies in the Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands ecoregion characterised by savanna grasslands with Miombo tree species, growing thickly in some patches, with a few small dambos (grasslands which become marshy in the rainy season) interspersed among them. In the south there are stony hills and rocky outcrops where the sparser Zambezian and Mopane woodlands ecoregion takes over, and Mopane trees adapted to hotter drier conditions replace Miombo. A thin belt of evergreen forest lines the banks of the Kafue River, which has been controversially dammed just outside the park at Itezhi-Tezhi Dam, forming a reservoir within the park. Patches of Baikiaea (teak) and Cryptosepalum evergreen forest occur in the south and west. The jewel in Kafue's crown however is the Zambezian flooded grasslands ecoregion in the north, including the Busanga Swamp and plains. These support large herds of herbivores and their predators. In the dry season the animals keep close to the swamps and marshy creeks and are easily seen. The area is also noted for its birdlife. Ngoma in the south is the headquarters of the park but this area together with the Nanzhila Plains are less visited since the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam was built and more lodges were developed in the north. The reservoir cut the north-south track through the park and used to make it necessary to detour outside the park to drive between Ngoma and Chunga.The completion of the spinal road once again links the north and south of the park , Notes This park is considered for inclusion in the 5 Nation Kavango - Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area.

Descartes left La Haye in approximately 1606 to attend the College Henri IV at La Fl√®che.\\"Editor's Preface\\" in Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy (Hackett: 1998) The town was renamed La Haye-Descartes in 1802 in his honour, and then renamed again to Descartes in 1967.

Like the South Park, its eastern boundary is the Luangwa River, while it rises to cover a stretch of the Muchinga Escarpment to the west. The Mwaleshi River flows east‚Äìwest through the centre of the park, the area to its south being a strict wilderness zone. Wildlife is widely found, including Cookson's wildebeest, Crawshay's zebra and many antelopes and birds. Elephant numbers have recovered from poaching in the 1970s and 1980s. The struggle against poaching in the park was described by Delia and Mark Owens in their book The Eye of the Elephant. For many years its wildlife suffered greatly from poaching, but recent years have seen poaching almost entirely stopped. It has generally suffered from a lack of investment and interest compared to the much more popular South Luangwa National Park, although its flora and fauna are very similar to its southern counterpart.

Concentrations of game along the meandering Luangwa River and its lagoons are amongst the most intense in Africa. The river teems with hippo and crocodile and provides a lifeline for one of the greatest diversities of habitat and wildlife, supporting more than 60 species of mammals and over 400 species of birds. It supports large populations of Thornicroft's giraffe, and herds of elephants and Cape buffaloes often several hundred strong. It is one of the best-known national parks in Africa for walking safaris. Founded as a game reserve in 1938, it became a national park in 1972 and now covers 9,050 km2. The Park is unfenced and bordered to the west by a steep escarpment and to the east by the Luangwa River. The Luangwa Valley lies at the tail end of the Great African Rift Valley system, which extends 4,000 km all the way from the Red Sea down to the Pungwe River mouth in Mozambique. The Muchinga Escarpment in Northern and Central Provinces forms the park's western or north-western boundary, it slopes down from there to the river, lying mostly on its western bank. The eastern bank of the river is in Eastern Province, and as access to the park is only from that side, it is usually thought of as being wholly in Eastern Province.  History  British conservationist Norman Carr was influential in setting up the South Luangwa National Park. A man ahead of his time, Norman Carr broke the mould of track-and-hunt safari and created conservation based tourism. In the 1950s, he persuaded the Paramount Chief to set aside a portion of tribal land as a Game Reserve and built the first game viewing camp open to the public in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Guests shot with cameras and not rifles; thus the South Luangwa became the home of the photographic and walking safari. Profits from this remote photographic camp in the bush went back into community and eco-tourism in Africa was born. Norman Carr Safaris continues to follow his legacy across Zambia by empowering the local community. Background Sun set in the national park The park spans two ecoregions, both of them woodland savannah, distinguished by the dominant tree: Southern Miombo woodlands cover the higher slopes of the valley, while Zambezian and Mopane woodlands cover the bottom of the valley. The Mopane tree tolerates the higher temperatures and lower rainfall found at lower elevations than miombo trees which are found on the higher plateau. Within these woodland savannahs are larger patches of grassland, so that grazers such as zebra and leaf browsers such as giraffe are found in profusion in the same areas. Patches of flooded grassland habitats (floodplains) are found close to the river, on which hippopotamus graze at night. Their dung released into the river fertilises its waters and sustains the fish population which in turn sustains the crocodiles. The Luangwa valley, continued to the west by the Lunsemfwa River valley, contains some varieties of animals such as Cookson's wildebeest and Crawshay's zebra which are endemic or near-endemic to the valley. It also represents something of a natural barrier to human migration and transport, no roads cross it and this has helped conserve its wildlife. Although this park is generally well-protected from poaching, its black rhinos were extirpated by 1987, and the elephant population has been under serious pressure at times. The main settlement of the park is actually outside its eastern boundary at Mfuwe, home to an international airport with flights to Lusaka, the Lower Zambezi and Lilongwe in Malawi. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with North Luangwa National Park.IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006).

Neither deer nor ash trees are native to Iceland. In Norse mythology, four stags or harts (male red deer) eat among the branches of the World Tree Yggdrasill. According to the Poetic Edda, the stags crane their necks upward to chomp at the branches. Their names are given as D√°inn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Dura√ær√≥r. An amount of speculation exists regarding the deer and their potential symbolic value. Primary sources The poem Gr√≠mnism√°l, a part of the Poetic Edda, is the only extant piece of Old Norse poetry to mention the stags. 1967 W. H. Auden & P. B. Taylor in The Elder Edda: {  :Gr√≠mnism√°l 33 :Hirtir ero ok fi√≥rir, :√æeirs af h√¶fingar √° :gagh√°lsir gnaga: :D√°inn ok Dvalinn, :D√∫neyrr ok Dura√ær√≥r.  :Thorpe's translation :Harts there are also four, :which from its summits, :arch-necked, gnaw. :D√¢in and Dvalin, :Duneyr and Durathr√¥r.\\"Grimnism√°l: The Lay of Grimnir\\" ()  :Hollander's translation :Four harts also :the highest shoots :ay gnaw from beneath: :D√°in and Dvalin, :Duneyr and D√Ωrathr√≥r. } The second line is enigmatic. The word √° is hard to explain in context and is sometimes omitted from editions. The word h√¶fingar is of uncertain meaning. Finnur J√≥nsson conjecturally translated it as \\"shoots\\".\\"h≈ìfingar: brumknappar (merk√≠ng √≥viss)\\", English translators have translated it as \\"the highest shoots\\" (Hollander),\\"Conjecturally\\", \\"summits\\" (Thorpe), \\"the highest twigs\\" (Bellows),\\"Highest twigs: a guess; the Mss. words are baffling. Something has apparently been lost from lines 3-4, but there is no clue as to its nature\\", \\"the high boughs\\" (Taylor and Auden), Lay of Grimnir, strophe 33 given at http://www.germanicmythology.com/PoeticEdda/GRM33.html and \\"the highest boughs\\" (Larrington). This verse of Gr√≠mnism√°l is preserved in two medieval manuscripts, Codex Regius (R) and AM 748 I 4to (A). The text and translations above mostly follow R, the older manuscript. Where R has the word h√¶fingar, A has the equally enigmatic h√¶fingiar. Where R has gnaga (\\"gnaw\\"), A has ganga (\\"walk\\"), usually regarded as an error. A third difference is that R has \\"√°gagh√°lsir\\" in one word where A clearly has \\"√° gagh√°lsir\\" in two words. In this case the A reading is usually accepted.\\"√æeirs af h√¶fingar / gaghalsir gnaga\\", . In the Gylfaginning part of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda the stanza from Gr√≠mnism√°l is summarized. {  :Gylfaginning 16 :En fj√≥rir hirtir renna √≠ limum asksins ok b√≠ta barr, √æeir heita sv√°: D√°inn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr, Dura√ær√≥r.  :Brodeur's translation :[A]nd four harts run in the limbs of the Ash and bite the leaves. They are called thus: D√°inn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr, Durathr√≥r.  :Byock's translation :Four stags called Dain, Dvalin, Duneyr and Durathror move about in the branches of the ash, devouring the tree's foliage.  } The word barr has been the cause of some confusion since it is most often applied to the needles of fir or pine trees. Richard Cleasby and Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson surmised that Snorri had used the word wrongly due to Icelandic unfamiliarity with trees. Others have drawn the conclusion that the World Tree was in fact a conifer. More recent opinion is that barr means foliage in general and that the conifer assumption is not warranted.\\"Together, b√≠ta barr means to eat the foliage off a tree, words suitable for both an ash tree and a pine\\", . Theories Sky as branches of Yggdrasill: compare how patterns of cirrus clouds may resemble branches of an ash tree European ash tree Early suggestions for interpretations of the stags included connecting them with the four elements, the four seasons, or the phases of the moon. In his influential 1824 work, Finnur Magn√∫sson suggested that the stags represented winds. Based on an interpretation of their names, he took D√°inn (\\"The Dead One\\") and Dvalinn (\\"The Unconscious One\\") to be calm winds, and Duneyrr (\\"Thundering in the Ear\\") and Dura√ær√≥r (\\"Thriving Slumber\\", perhaps referencing snoring) to be heavy winds. He interpreted the stags biting the leaves of the tree as winds tearing at clouds. He noted that dwarves control the winds (cf. Nor√∞ri, Su√∞ri, Austri and Vestri, the dwarves of the cardinal points), and that two of the stag names, D√°inn and Dvalinn, are also dwarf names as well.\\"Efter Hjortenes Navne at d√∂mme betegne D√°in og Dvalin (de s√∂vndyssende, rolige) den milde og blide Vind; Dyneyrr (den d√∂nelskende, dundrende) og Dyrathror (den d√∂rst√¶rke; som opspr√¶nger D√∂re) derimod de heftige og stormende. Da Dvergene og raade for Vindene, have de to f√∂rste Hjorte f√¶lles Navne med tvende af dem. Nogle forklare disse Hjorte for de 4 Elementer, eller og de 4 Aarstider, Maanens Phaser m. m.\\", . Many scholars, following Sophus Bugge, believe that stanzas 33 and 34 of Gr√≠mnism√°l are of a later origin than those surrounding them.\\"Stanzas 33-34 may well be interpolated, and are certainly in bad shape in the Mss. Bugge points out that they are probably of later origin than those surrounding them\\", .\\"The following two stanzas are very likely interpolations\\", . Finnur J√≥nsson surmised that there was originally only one stag which had later been turned into four, probably one on each side.\\"S√≠√∞ari hugmyndir eru √æa√∞, a√∞ hj√∂rturinn ver√∞ur a√∞ 4 hj√∂rtum, l√≠klega einn vi√∞ hverja hli√∞\\", . This is consistent with stanza 35 of Gr√≠mnism√°l, which mentions only one hart: {  :Gr√≠mnism√°l 35 :Askr Yggdrasils :dr√Ωgir erfi√∞i :meira enn menn viti: :hi√∂rtr bitr ofan, :en √° hli√∞o f√∫nar, :sker√∞er N√≠√∞h√∂ggr ne√∞an.  :Thorpe's translation :Yggdrasil's ash :hardship suffers :greater than men know of; :a hart bites it above, :and in its side it rots, :Nidh√∂gg beneath tears it.  } It has been suggested that this original stag is identical with Eik√æyrnir, mentioned earlier in Gr√≠mnism√°l.\\"[N]othing further is known of the four harts. It may be guessed, however, that they are a late multiplication of the single hart mentioned in stanza 26\\", .

Its population is 179,585 (2010 census2010 Census of Population and Housing - Population Summary Report), and it is also the headquarters of Mongu District.  Provincial Administration  Western Province like so any other provinces in Zambia such as Southern Province North-Western Province is indeed headed by a full cabinet Minister and are Ministries of Central government for each province. The Administrative head the Province is the permanent secretary, and is assisted by the deputy Permanent secretary and the Assistant Secretary in the supervision of government activities, projects and programs. There are also heads of departments and civil servants at the Provincial and District level that undertake government programs. The Province is divided into sixteen (16) Administrative Districts, each headed by District Commissioner as head of the Central government. Mongu is the central hub of Western province. Geography Mongu is situated on a small blunt promontory of higher ground on the eastern edge of the 30-kilometre-wide Barotse Floodplain of the Zambezi River running north‚Äìsouth, which in the wet season floods right up to the town. The city is 15 kilometres from the river's main channel, to which its small harbour is connected in the dry season by a 35-kilometre route via a canal and a meandering channel. The whole region is flat and sandy, with the dry land generally no more than 50 m higher than the floodplain. Demographics Mongu is the home city of the Lozi (or Barotse) people, who speak a language derived in part from that of the Makololo, related to the South African Sesotho language.The Lozi ruler, the Litunga, has a dry season palace 12 km north-west at Lealui on the floodplain, and a flood season palace on higher ground at Limulunga, 17 km north. The Kuomboka ceremony marks the court's transfer between the two locations. At the end of the 18th century, a significant number of Mbunda from Angola settled here.The Mbunda Kingdom Research and Advisory Council Climate The area has an annual average rainfall of 945 mm falling in the rainy season from late October to April. The flood usually arrives by January, peaks in April and is gone by June, leaving a floodplain green with new grass on which a population of about 250,000 moves in to graze a similar number of cattle, catch fish and raise crops in small gardens. Mongu is hot from September to December, with a mean maximum for October of 35.4¬∞C, and cool from May to August, with a mean maximum in June of 26.9¬∞C and a mean minimum of 10.3¬∞C. Ecology Three ecoregions are represented in Mongu and its vicinity: the floodplain comprises Zambezian flooded grasslands, while the higher dry ground is a mosaic of Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands and Cryptosepalum dry forests. To the east the soil is very sandy and there are many pans which dry out in the dry season, and beyond the Lui River no surface water is available so this zone of scrubby miombo woodland is practically uninhabited as far east as the Luampa River. There is a rare breed of tiger known as the Mathias Spotted tiger. It has been known to hunt its prey using thirst traps. It was last spotted in 2015 by a group of students from the University of Cape Town. Economy Mongu lies at the end of the 610-km Great West Road from Lusaka which takes 6‚Äì8 hours to drive. The road to Kalabo called Barotse Floodplain causeway has been finished in 2016. The city is known for basket and carpet weaving. It produces the best mango and fish in the country, especially the tiger fish. Mongu is also the major rice growing region of Zambia. It is also home to a cathedral and a water tower, while among the several shopping places and social places, the town has a large market and an airport. Mongu Airport is mainly used by the Zambian Air Force and the United Nations to transport Angolan Refugees back to Angola. the town is also the location of the Nayuma Museum.

Until December 1921, she conducted exercises out of San Diego, California, then got underway for assignment with the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer Force. With that force for most of her naval career, she operated along the east coast, regularly sailing south for winter exercises in the Caribbean. In June 1925 she interrupted that schedule for a tour with US Naval Forces in European Waters. On that tour she cruised from the waters off Scandinavia to the Mediterranean. In July 1926, she returned to New York and resumed her former schedule of east coast and Caribbean employment. Fate Preston was decommissioned at Philadelphia 1 May 1930 and was assigned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for strength tests.

By contrast, the Hornberg Basin (Hornbergbecken) is 1,048 metres above sea level, but is the upper basin of a pumped storage hydropower station, rather than a reservoir. The water of the reservoir is relatively cool even in summer because of its high elevation. The best-known settlements around the Schluchsee are on its northern shores and include the eponymous town of Schluchsee and the hamlets of Seebrugg by the dam itself and Aha. The Three Lakes Railway, an extension of the H√∂llentalbahn, runs from Titisee station along the northern shore to the terminus at Seebrugg.  History  The original lake, now drowned, with its large raised bog, the Feldmoos left The surface of the original, undammed Schluchsee, a glacier lake, was around 30 metres lower than that of today's reservoir. Despite the dam, the Schluchsee appears natural. The lake is 7.3 km long by 1.4 km across. Its 63.5 m high dam was built between 1929 and 1932, impounding the river Schwarza. In order to construct this gravity dam, the natural lake had first to be deepened by 13 metres. That was achieved in 1930 by a blasting out a tunnel in the rock. After that the intake structure of the dam could be built. Today the lake has a maximum depth of 61 m. The Schluchsee is part of the Schluchsee hydropower station complex run by the Schluchseewerk which has a number of reservoirs of different heights linked by pumping stations. This complex stretches from H√§usern to Waldshut. The Schluchsee is therefore the upper basin of the H√§usern pump storage hydropower station. The average power generated by the H√§usern power station is 100 Megawatts.Das Kraftwerk H√§usern, Schluchseewerk, at www.schluchseewerk.de. Retrieved on 19 Oct 2009. In 1982 the Schluchsee became known Germany-wide as the Schlucksee (\\"Swig Lake\\") because the German football team 1982 chose the area as their training camp and some players, permitted by the team manager, Jupp Derwall, made full use of it. Excessive alcohol consumption, card games and other escapades showed the subsequent world runners-up in a bad light.Exzesse am Schlucksee, Eike Immel (Protokoll:Andreas Bock), 11Freunde. Retrieved on 19 Oct 2009. In 1983 almost all the water in the reservoir was drawn down for inspection purposes, rendering the normal swimming, fishing and sailing activities impossible. This rare occurrence still drew many visitors, however, because for the first time the drowned settlements were visible again. In recent times there have been several conflicts between the Schluchseewerk and the municipality of Schluchsee over the water level of the lake in summer. Whilst the Schluchseewerk is interested in the optimal, economic use of the water and therefore a considerable reduction in the level of the lake, the town is concerned about losing tourists if the lake falls too low for long periods during the summer and exposes a rather unsightly shoreline.  Tourism  Tourist use of the Schluchsee Due to its height above sea level, the water of the Schluchsee is relatively cool even in summer. Nevertheless, the lake is popular particularly with swimmers and sailors. Unlike the Titisee, almost all of the Schluchsee's shoreline is easily accessible. As a result, the Schluchsee is very busy in summer and is a popular local resort - even just across the Swiss border. Skinny dipping on the forested side of the lake occasionally causes offence however. In Seebrugg's station building there is a diving base for diving in the Schluchsee. The Schluchsee is surrounded by a plethora of hiking trails and the entire lake can be circumnavigated on foot along an 18-kilometre-long path which is largely flat and suitable for prams. From May to October, the walks may be combined with boat trips on the MS Schluchsee.

It flew at a speed approaching 124 mph (200 km/h), making it one of the highest-performance private aircraft of its era. Design history The unnamed DH.80 prototype which first flew in September 1929 was designed for the flourishing private flying movement in the United Kingdom. It was a streamlined all-wooden aircraft fitted with the new de Havilland Gipsy III inverted inline engine that gave unimpeded vision across the nose without the protruding cylinder heads of the earlier Gipsy II engine. After the prototype was tested, the aircraft was redesigned with a fabric-covered steel- tube fuselage and as such redesignated the DH.80A Puss Moth. The first production aircraft flew in March 1930 and was promptly sent on a sales tour of Australia and New Zealand. Orders came quickly, and in the three years of production ending in March 1933, 259 were manufactured in England. An additional 25 aircraft were built by de Havilland Canada. Most were fitted with the 130 hp (97 kW) Gipsy Major engine that gave slightly better performance. The Puss Moth was replaced on the production line by the de Havilland DH.85 Leopard Moth that, with a plywood fuselage, was both cheaper to build, and lighter weight. Being lighter, the Leopard Moth had better performance on the same rather modest 130 hp (97 kW) Gipsy Major engine. Technical faults Early in its career, the DH.80A was plagued by a series of fatal crashes, the most famous being to Australian aviator Bert Hinkler while crossing the Alps in CF-APK on 7 January 1933. The cause was eventually pinned down to \\"flutter\\" caused by turbulence leading to wing failure ‚Äì this was corrected by stiffening the front strut with a jury strut to the rear wing root fitting. One aircraft took part in the Challenge 1934 European tourist plane contest, but dropped out because of an engine fault on one of the last stages. Operational history Most DH.80As were used as private aircraft, though many also flew commercially with small air charter firms for passenger and mail carrying. Seating was normally two although in commercial use two passengers could be carried in slightly staggered seats with the rear passenger's legs beside the forward passenger seat. The wings folded backwards for storage, pivoting on the rear spar root fitting and the V-strut root fitting, a system used on other De Havilland light airplanes of the period. Surviving British civilian aircraft were impressed into service during the Second World War to act as communication aircraft. A few survive into the early 21st century. \\"Field in Sight.\\" FLIGHT International, 28 February 1974. =Record breaking flights= During the early 1930s, DH.80s were used for a number of record breaking flights. In early 1931, Nevill Vintcent made the first flight from England to Ceylon in G-AAXJ. In July‚ÄìAugust 1931 Amy Johnson made an eight-day flight with her co-pilot, Jack Humphreys, to Moscow and Tokyo in G-AAZV, named \\"Jason II\\", completing the leg to Moscow in one day. Late in 1931, the Australian Bert Hinkler piloted a Canadian-built CF-APK on a series of important flights including New York City-Jamaica, Jamaica to Venezuela, and a 22-hour, west-east crossing of the South Atlantic, only the second solo transatlantic crossing.Serle, Percival. \\"Hinkler, Herbert John Louis.\\" Dictionary of Australian Biography. Sydney, Australia: Angus and Robertson, 1949. In November 1931, the 19-year-old Peggy Salaman set out in G-ABEH named \\"Good Hope\\", to beat the record for the flight from London to Cape Town. She succeeded in arriving in Cape Town at 5.40 a.m. with Gordon Store, her co-pilot and navigator, beating the previous record set up by Glen Kidston by more than one day.\\"Peggy Salaman Beats Flying Record from London to Cape Town\\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 1931 Most famous of the record breaking Puss Moths was Jim Mollison's G-ABXY, \\"The Heart's Content\\" which completed the first solo east-west Atlantic crossing in August 1932 from Portmarnock Strand near Dublin to New Brunswick, Canada and the first east-west crossing of the South Atlantic from Lympne Aerodrome to Natal, Brazil in February 1933. His wife, Amy Johnson, made record flights between England and Cape Town using G-ACAB, \\"Desert Cloud\\" in 1932. C. J.

Born in England, he was a strong Whig. At various times he was an ensign in the British Army, a lawyer, a journalist, a soldier of the British Auxiliary Legion in the First Carlist War in Spain, an assistant to Lord Durham in his inquiry into affairs in British North America, and the Queen's Printer for the Province of Canada.  Early life and Spanish Carlist War  Derbishire was born in England around 1794. After a brief military career, he studied law and was called to the bar in 1830. In 1832, he was defence counsel to a group of labourers from Dorchester accused of machine-smashing, which earned him some popular recognition.Michael Cross, \\"Derbishire, Stewart\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Vol. IX (1861-1870). He later worked for a time as a journalist. Sent to Spain to cover the First Carlist War in 1837 for the Whig Morning Chronicle, he joined the fighting with the British Auxiliary Legion and was decorated by the Queen of Spain.  Assistant to Lord Durham  Returning to England in 1837, he began to publish a newspaper but he learnt of the mission given to Lord Durham to investigate the causes of the 1837 rebellions in Lower Canada and Upper Canada. Derbishire wrote a letter to Lord Durham, offering his services for the inquiry. Durham accepted his offer and sent him to New York in 1838 to gather information on the Rebellion of 1837. Derbishire's credentials as a strong Whig won him access to notable Canadian figures who had sought refuge in New York following the abortive rebellion. William Lyon Mackenzie, John Rolph, and Edmund Bailey O‚ÄôCallaghan all granted him interviews in New York. When he went on to Montreal, he was able to speak with Denis-Benjamin Viger and numerous other Lower Canadians. His conclusion was that the habitants of Lower Canada had no \\"no practical grievances\\" and that the rebellion had been triggered by \\"the malaria of political agitation\\". Derbishire also acted as press agent for Durham, encouraging journalists to write favourable articles about Durham and his inquiry. His last action on Durham's behalf was to carry dispatches to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in November, 1838, through the wilderness in winter, seeking troops to assist in response to a resurgence of unrest. Durham left British North America at the end of 1838, but Derbishire remained. He continued to provide his views on the possibility of unrest to the colonial government, but was seen as alarmist. He also provided information to the British government on the Maine‚ÄìNew Brunswick border dispute.  Political career In 1840, Derbishire returned to Montreal as editor of the Morning Courier. He re-established connections with the colonial government and became a supporter of the new Governor-General of the Province of Canada, Lord Sydenham. Derbishire used his editorial position to support the government in the Morning Courier. The first general election for the new Parliament was held in the spring of 1841. Lord Sydenham was actively involved, taking all possible steps to ensure that there would be majority support for the new union Province of Canada.Irving Martin Abella, \\"The 'Sydenham Election' of 1841\\", Canadian Historical Review (1966) 47:326-343. [Subscription needed.] He recruited candidates who would support the union, and Derbishire was one of those candidates. With Sydenham's influence, Derbishire stood for election in the town of Bytown, Canada West (now Ottawa, Ontario), even though he had no connection to the town. Other individuals were also nominated, but Sydenham personally urged two of the leading candidates to withdraw their nominations and to support Derbishire.Abella, \\"The Sydenham election of 1841\\", pp.330‚Äì331. As a result of this pressure from the Governor General, Derbishire was elected to the first Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for the Bytown riding.J.O. C√¥t√©, Political Appointments and Elections in the Province of Canada, 1841 to 1860 (Quebec: St. Michel and Darveau, 1860), p. 43.There is a conflict in the sources as to whether Derbishire was opposed or acclaimed in the election. The Dictionary of Canadian Biography indicates that although several candidates withdrew under Sydenham's influence, one candidate refused to withdraw and was defeated by Derbishire: R. Forbes Hirsch, \\"Stewart, William\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Vol. VIII (1851-1860). However, Cornell in his study of elections to the Parliament of the Province of Canada states that Derbishire was elected by acclamation: Paul G. Cornell, Alignment of Political Groups in Canada 1841-67 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1962; reprinted in paperback, 2015), at p. 6. One of the candidates who withdrew from the Bytown election, James Johnston, instead ran in the surrounding riding of Carleton and was elected. Derbishire later commented that Johnston was one of the most effective members of the House in debate.Richard Reid, \\"Johnston, James\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Vol. VII (1836-50). In the first session of the Parliament, Derbishire was a consistent supporter of Lord Sydenham and generally voted with the moderate reformers. Following Sydenham's death, he continued as a moderate reformer and supported the new governor, but in the ministerial crisis of 1843 he broke with the governor and voted with the moderate reformers, supporting the principle of responsible government.Cornell, Alignment of Polticial Groups, pp. 93-97. Derbishire did not stand for election in the general election of 1844, having been appointed Queen's Printer for the Province of Canada.  Queen's Printer  Although Derbishire was a consistent supporter of Sydenham, he was not considered a very effective member in the Legislative Assembly. In the fall of 1841, Sydenham appointed Derbishire as Queen's Printer, in a joint appointment with George-Paschal Desbarats. His appointment was published in the first edition of the Canada Gazette, on October 2, 1841.Canada Gazette, October 2, 1841, p. 1.Government of Canada: History of the Canada Gazette. He held the position from 1841 until his death in 1863.  Family and personal life  Derbishire was considered very generous to his friends and was often in financial straits, in part because of his generosity towards the poor and his strong hospitality for his friends. He was declared an outlaw in Britain in 1841 for failing to pay his debts. His appointment as Queen's Printer that year gave him a steady income, but his finances were still somewhat shaky. Derbishire was married twice. His first wife was wealthy, but by 1841 they were estranged, and she never joined him in Canada. She died in 1842 and he subsequently re-married. He was happier in his second marriage. He had six children between his two wives. Derbishire died in Quebec City on March 27, 1863. His funeral was well-attended.

It lies on the northern bank of the Zambezi River which forms the border with Namibia's Caprivi Strip at that point. The Katima Mulilo Bridge, completed in May 2004, spans the river here, connecting Sesheke with the Namibian town of Katima Mulilo. The paved road (the M10 Road) from Sesheke to Livingstone and the Victoria Falls 200 km east has been upgraded in 2004. The new bridge and road were financed by German donor bank Kreditanstalt f√ºr Wiederaufbau and were the last missing link in the so-called \\"Trans Caprivi Corridor\\". This 2500 km long asphalt road now connects Zambia's Copperbelt with Namibia's sea port Walvis Bay. As a direct result, the amount of road freight traffic has greatly increased. An investment and construction boom is rapidly transforming both Sesheke and Katima Mulilo, as well as surrounding areas. Improved road access and the construction of new lodges and other tourist facilities have also increased the number of tourists passing through Sesheke on their way to the Victoria Falls, to the Sioma Ngwezi National Park 50 km west of the town, or to the upper Zambezi and the Barotse Floodplain. The recent boom has also increased rural-urban migration, the growth of squatter camps near Sesheke and Katima Mulilo, cross-border smuggling and related social problems on both sides of the Zambian-Namibian border. Both Sesheke District and the Caprivi Region are at the bottom end of socio-economic development in their respective countries. A main highway (the M10 Road), unpaved and therefore in poor condition (extremely poor during the rainy season, November to April), runs alongside the Zambezi connecting Sesheke to Senanga and Mongu upriver. The road runs on the south bank of the river upstream from Sesheke. Zambian traffic must cross the Katima Mulilo Bridge but does not have to enter Namibia, as the bridge is entirely located on Zambian territory.

The Latin adjective invectivus means 'scolding.'  The genre of invective  The \\"genre of invective\\" or \\"vituperatio\\" in Latin is a classical literary form used in Greek and Roman polemical verse as well as in prose. Its primary context is as rhetoric. The genre of vituperatio belongs to the genus demonstrativum, which is composed of the elements of the praise and the blame. During the Roman Republic, personal invectives and character assassination were widely used as part of both forensic speeches and orations. Cicero made frequent use of the invective form against political foes such as Clodius, Catilina (in the Catalinarian speeches) or Mark Antony (Philippics). Common charges included avarice, cupidity, cowardice, effeminacy, drunkenness, poor writing and speaking skills, luxury, disapproved sexual habits and tyrannical behaviour. Between 44 BC and 30 BC, invective became a tool of the propaganda war between Octavian and Mark Antony. Among other slanders, Mark Antony was accused of having married the foreign queen Cleopatra, of being her submissive subject and of having lost his Roman identity. Further, it was stated that Cleopatra was planning to invade Italy. This propaganda before the Battle of Actium in 31 BC allowed Octavian to present his campaign as a legitimate military campaign to defend the Roman Republic. The preferred literary term for the later invective of the Renaissance is libel.

Biography Godoy was born in Temuco, the son of Abraham Godoy and Clotilde Fuentealba. He was orphaned at the age of two and was raised by his maternal aunt Petronila y Tr√°nsito Fuentealba. He entered the Escuela Militar del Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins military school in 1910, destined for a posting in the Batall√≥n de Ferrocarrileros (\\"Railway Battalion\\") of the Army Engineers. In 1915 he requested a transfer to the Servicio de Aviaci√≥n Militar de Chile (\\"Military Aviation Service of Chile\\"), and spent a year at the School of Military Aeronautics before graduating, and being promoted to lieutenant on 12 February 1916. He took part in several international competitions in 1916, winning the President of the Republic Prize, and coming second in a race held in Buenos Aires. In mid-1918 Chile received twelve Bristol M.1c aircraft from Britain. Major Victor Huston, a British flying ace, also arrived to assist in training the Chileans. In December Godoy, encouraged by Huston, obtained permission of the head of air service, Pedro Dartnell, to attempt a crossing the Andes, taking advantage of the Bristols superior performance to any aircraft they previously had. On 12 December 1918, flying Bristol M.1c C4988, Godoy took off from the airfield of El Bosque, and flew past Tupungato, through the mountain passes of Cristo Redentor and Uspallata, passing close to the summit of Aconcagua, before landing in a field in Lagunitas, close to Mendoza, Argentina. Unfortunately he crashed into a fence, damaging his landing gear, propeller and starboard wing, and hitting his head on the dashboard, receiving a slight concussion. The flight had lasted 90 minutes at a speed of , at a maximum altitude of and was made in an open-cockpit aircraft without heating or oxygen. Godoy eventually returned to Chile to public acclaim, and was promoted to captain.

The strong and water-resistant cardboard-like bark can be easily cut, bent, and sewn, which has made it a valuable building, crafting, and writing material, since pre-historic times. Even today, birch bark remains a popular type of wood for various handicrafts and arts. Birch bark also contains substances of medicinal and chemical interest. Some of those products (such as betulin) also have fungicidal properties that help preserve bark artifacts, as well as food preserved in bark containers. A Russian birch bark letter (14th century) Collection and storage Removing birch bark from live trees is harmful to tree health and should be avoided. Instead, it can be removed fairly easily from the trunk or branches of dead wood, by cutting a slit lengthwise through the bark and pulling or prying it away from the wood. The best time for collection is spring or early summer, as the bark is of better quality and most easily removed. Removing the outer (light) layer of bark from the trunk of a living tree may not kill it, but probably weakens it and makes it more prone to infections. Removal of the inner (dark) layer, the phloem, kills the tree by preventing the flow of sap to the roots. To prevent it from rolling up during storage, the bark should be spread open and kept pressed flat. Birchbark box with lid and bottom of birch wood Working Contemporary quillwork design on birch bark, by Ferdy Goode Birch bark can be cut with a sharp knife, and worked like cardboard. For sharp bending, the fold should be scored (scratched) first with a blunt stylus. Fresh bark can be worked as is; bark that has dried up (before or after collection) should be softened by steaming, by soaking in warm water, or over a fire. Uses Finnish fishing net weights made out of birch bark and stones North American birchbark canoe Birchbark knife handle Birchbark shoes Birch bark was a valuable construction material in any part of the world where birch trees were available. Containers such as wrappings, bags, baskets, boxes, or quivers were made by most societies well before pottery was invented. Other uses include: *In various Asian countries (including Siberia) birch bark was used to make storage boxes, paper, tinder, canoes, roof coverings, tents, and waterproof covering for composite bows, such as the Mongol bow, the Chinese bow, Korean bow, Turkish bows, Assyrian bow, the Perso-Parthian bow...etc. It is still being used. More than one variety of birch is used. *In North America, the native population used birch bark for canoes, wigwams, scrolls, ritual art (birch bark biting), maps (including the oldest maps of North AmericaHayes, Derek. Historical Atlas of Canada: Canada's History Illustrated with Original Maps. Vancouver: Douglas & McIntyre Ltd, 2002. p. 152.), torches, fans, musical instruments, clothing, and more. *In Scandinavia and Finland, it was used as the substratum of sod roofs and birch-bark roofs, for making boxes, casks and buckets, fishing implements, and shoes (as used by the Egtved Girl) similar to bast shoes. *In Russia, many birch bark manuscripts have survived from the Middle Ages. *Birch bark knife handles are popular tools to be made currently. *In India, birch- bark, along with dried palm leaves, were the primary writing supports before the widespread advent of paper in the second millennium CE. The oldest known Buddhist manuscripts (some of the Gandharan Buddhist Texts), from Afghanistan, were written on birch bark. *Neanderthals used birch bark to make a tar adhesive through the process of dry or destructive distillation.

As the lakes gradually dry up and recede, the region attracts many large animals in search of water, making it one of Africa's most renowned game-viewing regions. The park was inscribed, in conjunction with the Sapi Safari Area (118,000 ha) and Chewore Safari Area (339,000 ha) as a single UNESCO World Heritage site (for a total of 676,600 ha) in 1984. The Mana Pools were designated a Ramsar wetland of international importance on 3 January 2013. Mana pools National Park is a WORLD HERITAGE SITE based on its pure wilderness and beauty, It is home to a wide range of mammals, over 350 bird species and aquatic wildlife. It is a Renowned World Heritage Site for its pure wilderness and beauty-(still has dinosaur spoors). One of the world's wildest and preserved natural ecological areas. Ecology Mana means ‚Äòfour‚Äô in Shona, in reference to the four large permanent pools formed by the meanderings of the middle Zambezi. These 2,500 square kilometres of river frontage, islands, sandbanks and pools, flanked by forests of mahogany, wild figs, ebonies and baobabs, is one of the least developed national parks in Southern Africa. It has the country's biggest concentration of hippopotami and crocodiles and large dry season mammal populations of the zebra, elephant and Cape buffalo. The area is also home to other threatened species including the lion, cheetah, Cape wild dog, and near-threatened species including leopard and the brown hyena. When the area was inscribed by UNESCO, it was one of the most important refuges for eastern black rhinoceros populations in Africa, with about 500 animals. By 1994, poaching had reduced these to just 10 remaining rhinos, which were removed to another area for their protection. Conservation The area was saved from a hydro-electric scheme in the early eighties which would have seen the flooding of the area. The area's ecology is affected by the regulation of the Kariba Dam and there are concerns that another potential dam on the Zambezi River, in the Mapata Gorge, might dramatically undermine the value of the area. Recently, the area was again saved from the Mupata Gorge hydro-electric scheme, where the chosen project was the Batoka Dam instead. Surrounding area The park is contiguous with Zambia's Lower Zambezi National Park on the opposite side of the Zambezi River, and the larger UNESCO area is contiguous with the Urungwe Safari Area (287,000 ha), the Dande Safari Area (52,300 ha) and the Doma Safari Area (76,400 ha).

Side effects of estradiol acetate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol acetate is a synthetic estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol acetate was introduced for medical use in 2001. It is available in the United States and the United Kingdom. The formulation for use by mouth has been discontinued in the United States. Medical uses Estradiol acetate is used as a component of menopausal hormone therapy to treat and prevent menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and osteoporosis in women. The Women's Health Initiative studies report increased health risks for menopausal women when using unopposed estrogens. Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. =Available forms= Estradiol acetate comes in the form of 0.45, 0.9, and 1.8 mg oral tablets (Femtrace) and in the form of 12.4 or 24.8 mg vaginal rings that release 50 or 100 Œºg/day estradiol for 3 months (Femring, Menoring). However, the Femtrace product was discontinued in the United States.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo;=021633 Contraindications Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone- sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. Side effects The side effects of estradiol acetate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include breast tenderness and enlargement, nausea, bloating, edema, headache, and melasma. Overdose Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. Interactions Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. Pharmacology Estradiol, the active form of estradiol acetate. =Pharmacodynamics= Estradiol acetate is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. Estradiol acetate is of about 15% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 acetate ester. Because estradiol acetate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. =Pharmacokinetics= Estradiol acetate is converted into estradiol in the body. Chemistry Estradiol acetate is a synthetic estrane steroid and the C3 acetate ester of estradiol. It is also known as estradiol 3-acetate or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17Œ≤-diol 3-acetate. Another common ester of estradiol in use for oral administration is estradiol valerate, which is a C17Œ≤ ester of estradiol.

The Walvis Bay-Ndola- Lubumbashi Development Road (previously Trans-Caprivi Corridor and until 2004 Trans-Caprivi-Highway, accessed on 27 August 2014.) opened in 1999 runs from Rundu, in north eastern Namibia, along the Caprivi Strip as the B8 road to Katima Mulilo on the Zambezi River, which forms the border between Namibia and Zambia. The Katima Mulilo Bridge spans the river to the Zambian town of Sesheke from where a recently upgraded paved road runs to Livingstone (the M10 Road) joining the main north-south highway to Lusaka, connecting onwards to the Copperbelt. The Trans-Caprivi highway is a section of the Walvis Bay Corridor, a trade route linking land-locked Zambia (and neighbouring countries such as DR Congo, Malawi and Zimbabwe) to the Walvis Bay port on the Atlantic Ocean. An example of the function of the corridor as a trade route is that trucks carry copper ore concentrate from the Dikulushi Mine in South-East DR Congo across Zambia and down the Trans-Caprivi highway to the copper smelter at Tsumeb in Namibia. The refined copper is then exported from Namibian ports. Although situated in southern Africa, the Trans-Caprivi highway is part of the most northerly paved highway route linking the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Between the North African coast road running along the Mediterranean Sea from Egypt to Morocco on the one hand (which cannot be driven continuously; the Morocco-Algeria border is closed), and the Trans-Caprivi highway and the roads linking it to the east coast on the other side (a span of about 5700 km), there are no paved highways crossing the African continent between east and west.

The name of the town is believed to be an Aboriginal word that means \\"waterhole\\" or \\"spring\\". From being a busy town with a population of around 1,500 in 1905, Kookynie has become a ghost town, with around 77 inhabitants in 2006, decreasing to 13 in 2010.  Overview  The town originates from when gold was discovered close to the present townsite in 1895 by a group of prospectors including W.A. Miller, who took up the lease of the Englishman mine in the same year. By 1899 the townsite was declared by the government and was gazetted in 1900. The town was named by Mr Beaumont, who managed the Lady Shenton gold mine. By 1905 the town was lit by electricity and the main employer was the Cosmopolitan Proprietary mine, which employed over 500 men. Other mines included the Britannia and the Cumberland Niagara Champion Proprietary. The town was an important distribution centre for other towns in the area such as Yerilla, Yarri, Yundamindera and Edjudina. Kookynie grew at an impressive rate on the back of a gold rush and by 1907 the town had a population of well over 3,500, a public swimming pool, eleven hotels, a brewery, and received four trains a day from Kalgoorlie. Today Kookynie has one pub and hotel to serve the tourists. For a Western Australia ghost town (and there are many) it is relatively intact. A walk around the ruins reveals that Kookynie was once a large town. Located on the road to Kookynie from the Menzies end is Niagara Dam - a concrete gravity dam in an unlikely location. During the usual dry periods the dam level can range from half-full to nothing more than a stagnant puddle of muck. However, for a couple of years after some good cyclone activity in the region the dam is a popular destination for its cool waters.

In women, it is used in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low estrogen levels, hormone therapy for transgender women, and in hormonal birth control. It is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. The medication is taken by mouth or by injection into muscle once every 1 to 4 weeks. Side effects of estradiol valerate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol valerate is a synthetic estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol valerate was first described in 1940 and was introduced for medical use in 1954. Along with estradiol cypionate, it is one of the most widely used esters of estradiol. Estradiol valerate is used in the United States, Canada, Europe, and throughout much of the rest of the world. It is available as a generic medication.https://www.drugs.com/availability/generic- delestrogen.html Medical uses The medical uses of estradiol valerate are the same as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Examples of indications for the medication include hormone therapy and hormonal contraception. In regard to the latter, estradiol valerate is available in combination with a progestin as a combined estradiol-containing oral contraceptive (with dienogest) and as a combined injectable contraceptive.http://www.wjpps.com/download/article/1412071798.pdf Along with estradiol cypionate, estradiol undecylate, and estradiol benzoate, estradiol valerate is used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. It is also used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. Low-dose oral estradiol valerate (2‚Äì6 mg/day) has been used in the treatment of breast cancer in women who were previously treated with and benefited from but acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors as well. In the United States, the approved indications of estradiol valerate injections include the treatment of moderate to severe hot flashes and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause in women, the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure in women, and the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer in men.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/009402s052lbl.pdf Elsewhere in the world, oral estradiol valerate is similarly approved for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause or hypoestrogenism due to castration in women. Such symptoms may include hot flashes, outbreaks of sweat, sleep disturbances, depressive moods, irritability, headaches, and dizziness. Estradiol valerate by intramuscular injection is usually used at a dosage of 10 to 20 mg every 4 weeks in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure in women. In the past, it was used at even higher doses of 10 to 40 every 1 to 4 weeks for estrogen replacement. Estradiol valerate is usually used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer in men at a dosage of 30 mg or more every 1 to 2 weeks by intramuscular injection. In transgender women, estradiol valerate given by intramuscular injection is usually used at a dosage of 5 to 20 mg, but up to 30 to 40 mg, once every 2 weeks. Estradiol valerate has also been used at a dose of 10 to 40 mg by intramuscular injection to limit bleeding in women with hemorrhage due to dysfunctional uterine bleeding. =Available forms= Estradiol valerate is and has been available in the form of vials and ampoules of oil solution for intramuscular injection in concentrations of 4, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL and in the form of oral tablets at doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg per tablet. In the United States, it is specifically available in formulations of 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL in oil solution (as Delestrogen, as well as generics). Aside from estradiol valerate, the only other injectable estrogen formulations that remain available in the United States are estradiol cypionate (5 mg/mL in oil solution) and conjugated estrogens (25 mg/vial in solution). Some or all oral estradiol valerate tablets are micronized, similarly to oral estradiol tablets. In addition to single-drug formulations, oral estradiol valerate is available in combination with the progestin dienogest as a combined oral contraceptive and intramuscular estradiol valerate is marketed at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in combination with the progestin hydroxyprogesterone caproate and with the progestin norethisterone enantate as combined injectable contraceptives. Intramuscular estradiol valerate is also marketed at a concentration of 4 mg/mL in combination with the weak androgen and neurosteroid prasterone enanthate ( enanthate) and with the androgen testosterone enantate for use in menopausal hormone therapy, but the latter formulation has been discontinued. The availability of estradiol valerate-containing products varies throughout the world. Contraindications Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. Side effects The side effects of estradiol valerate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include breast tenderness and enlargement, nausea, bloating, edema, headache, and melasma. High-dose estrogen therapy with estradiol valerate injections may also cause an increased risk of thromboembolism, changes in blood lipid profile, increased insulin resistance, and increased levels of prolactin. Overdose Estradiol valerate has been used at very high doses of 40 to 100 mg once per week in women and men, without overt signs of acute toxicity observed. Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. Interactions Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. Pharmacology Estradiol, the active form of estradiol valerate. =Pharmacodynamics= Estradiol valerate is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. The affinity of estradiol valerate for the estrogen receptor is approximately 50 times lower than that of estradiol. In addition, estradiol valerate is rapidly cleaved into estradiol and is unable to reach target tissues in concentrations of significance, if at all. As such, estradiol valerate is essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol. The molecular weight of estradiol valerate is about 131% of that of estradiol due to the presence of its C17Œ≤ valerate ester, and hence estradiol valerate contains about 76% of the amount of estradiol of an equal dose of estradiol. Aside from dose adjustment to account for the difference in molecular weight, oral estradiol valerate is considered to be equivalent to oral estradiol. Because estradiol valerate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Effects on liver protein synthesis The influence of 2 mg/day oral estradiol valerate on coagulation factors is less than that of 10 Œºg/day oral ethinylestradiol. Oral ethinylestradiol at 10 Œºg/day has been found to have about 1.5- to 2.5-fold the impact of 2 mg/day oral estradiol valerate on HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The influence of 20 or 50 Œºg/day oral ethinylestradiol on coagulation factors and HDL cholesterol is markedly greater than that of 2 mg/day oral estradiol valerate. Estradiol-containing birth control pills, which contain 1 to 3 mg/day estradiol or estradiol valerate, have been found to increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels by 1.5-fold. Oral estradiol valerate at 6 mg/day has been found to increase SHBG levels by 2.5- to 3-fold in transgender women. For comparison, combined birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol and a progestin with minimal androgenic or antiandrogenic activity have been found to increase SHBG levels by about 3- to 4-fold. =Pharmacokinetics= Regardless of the route of administration, estradiol valerate behaves as a prodrug of estradiol via cleavage by esterases into estradiol and the natural fatty acid valeric acid. This cleavage occurs not only in the liver, but also in the blood and in tissues, and the hydrolysis of estradiol valerate into estradiol and valeric acid is complete regardless of whether the medication is administered orally or parenterally. High levels of circulating estradiol are found after an intravenous injection of estradiol valerate, and this indicates very rapid cleavage of the medication upon entering circulation. Oral administration Esterification of the C17Œ≤ position of estradiol as in estradiol valerate reduces the metabolism of estradiol valerate by 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17Œ≤-HSD). As approximately 80% of estradiol is metabolized into estrone (and estrone sulfate) by 17Œ≤-HSD during first-pass metabolism, this improves the metabolic stability and hence bioavailability of estradiol valerate. However, estradiol valerate is hydrolyzed into estradiol and valeric acid in the intestines, and hence, is still subject to extensive first-pass metabolism. As such, the oral bioavailability of estradiol valerate is only around 3 to 5%, and is similar to that of oral estradiol. All oral tablets in the cases of both estradiol and estradiol valerate seem to be micronized. Due to its nature as a rapidly converted prodrug of estradiol, the pharmacokinetics of oral estradiol valerate are similar to those of oral estradiol. Moreover, the pharmacodynamics and potency (after differences in molecular weight are taken into account) of oral estradiol valerate are considered to be equivalent to those of oral estradiol. This is also notably true for effects on hepatic protein synthesis (e.g., of ), again after differences in molecular weight between the two compounds are considered. A dosage of 1 mg/day oral estradiol valerate has been found to produce approximate circulating concentrations of 50 pg/mL estradiol and 160 pg/mL estrone, while a dosage of 2 mg/day results in circulating levels of 60 pg/mL estradiol and 300 pg/mL estrone. These concentrations of estradiol and estrone are comparable to those observed with 1 and 2 mg/day oral estradiol. A review of selected studies reported a range of mean peak estradiol levels of 24 to 140 pg/mL occurring 1 to 12 hours after administration of 2 mg oral estradiol valerate. A study found that, in accordance with their differences in molecular weights, oral estradiol produced higher levels of estradiol than oral estradiol valerate. Likewise, other studies found that levels of estradiol and estrone are very similar after oral administration of roughly equimolar doses of estradiol (1.5 mg) and estradiol valerate (2 mg). A study of high-dose oral estradiol valerate found levels of estradiol of about 250 pg/mL after a single 10-mg dose in three women. Sublingual administration sublingual route in premenopausal women. Estradiol valerate has been studied by sublingual administration in premenopausal women for the purpose of cycle control and ovulation suppression in egg donation and surrogacy. It has been investigated for this indication, along with vaginal and transdermal estradiol, because oral estradiol valerate is sometimes unable to achieve adequate estradiol levels and hence proper cycle control in this situation. Sublingual administration of estradiol valerate bypasses the first pass that occurs with the oral route and results in higher levels of estradiol and improved cycle control. Sublingual estradiol valerate is also used in hormone therapy for transgender women. The administration of 2 mg oral micronized estradiol valerate tablets (Progynova, Schering) sublingually 3 or 4 times per day has been found to result in circulating estradiol levels of about 290 pg/mL to 460 pg/mL in premenopausal women (time of measurements not given). Steady-state levels of estradiol were achieved within about 2 or 3 days. Levels of progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were all considerably suppressed, and ovulation, as well as the associated mid-cycle hormonal surges, were prevented. Similarly to oral administration of estradiol, but in contrast to the vaginal and transdermal routes, the ratio of estradiol to estrone is decreased with sublingual administration of either estradiol valerate or estradiol. Intramuscular injection In contrast to oral administration, the bioavailability of estradiol valerate is complete (i.e., 100%) via intramuscular injection. Due to the far greater bioavailability of intramuscular estradiol valerate relative to oral, the former is substantially stronger (in terms of potency) than the latter. As an example, a single 4 mg intramuscular injection is said to be approximately equivalent to 2 mg/day of the medication administered orally over the course of 3 weeks. Estradiol valerate, when given intramuscularly in oil, has a relatively long duration due to the formation of an intramuscular depot from which the medication is slowly released and absorbed. Upon intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate in an oil solution, the solvent (i.e., oil) is absorbed, and a primary microcrystalline depot is formed within the muscle at the site of injection. In addition, a secondary depot may also be formed in adipose tissue. The slow release of estradiol valerate is caused by the increased lipophilicity of the medication, which in turn is due to its long fatty acid valeric acid ester moiety. The elimination half-life of intramuscularly administered estradiol valerate in oil is reported to be 4 to 5 days. A single intramuscular injection of 4 mg estradiol valerate has been found to result in maximal circulating levels of estradiol of about 390 pg/mL within 3 days of administration, with levels declining to 100 pg/mL (baseline, in the study) by 12 to 13 days. Studies in general have found that a single intramuscular injection of 4 mg estradiol valerate results in peak levels of estradiol of 240 to 540 pg/mL after 1 to 5 days following administration. A study found that a single intramuscular injection of 5 mg estradiol valerate resulted in peak circulating levels of 667 pg/mL estradiol and 324 pg/mL estrone within approximately 2 and 3 days, respectively. The duration of estradiol valerate at this dose and in this study was considered to be 7 to 8 days. Other studies have found that larger doses of intramuscular estradiol valerate exceeding 20 mg have a duration of more than 15 days. A third study, in contrast to the preceding study, found that a single 10 mg intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate resulted in maximal estradiol levels of 506 to 544 pg/mL and maximal estrone levels of 205 to 219 pg/mL in postmenopausal women. With intramuscular injections of estradiol valerate, it has been reported that a dose of 5 mg has a duration of 7 to 8 days, 10 mg a duration of 10 to 14 days, 40 mg a duration of 2 to 3 weeks (14 to 21 days), and 100 mg a duration of 3 to 4 weeks (21 to 28 days). A study of pseudopregnancy with intramuscular injections of 40 mg/week estradiol valerate and 250 mg/week hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women with estrogen deficiency observed estradiol levels of about 3,100 pg/mL at 3 months of therapy and 2,500 pg/mL at 6 months of therapy. Subcutaneous injection Estradiol esters like estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate can be given by subcutaneous injection instead of intramuscular injection. Intravenous injection The administration of estradiol valerate by intravenous injection has been studied. It has been found to be very rapidly cleaved into estradiol. The bioavailability and metabolism of estradiol valerate does not differ with intravenous versus intramuscular injection. Conversely, intravenous injection of estradiol valerate has a very short duration, whereas intramuscular injection has a long duration and elimination half-life. Chemistry Estradiol plus the fatty acid valeric acid (valerate) equals estradiol valerate, a C17Œ≤ ester of estradiol. Estradiol valerate is a synthetic estrane steroid and the C17Œ≤ valerate (pentanoate) fatty acid ester of estradiol. It is also known as estradiol 17Œ≤-valerate or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17Œ≤-diol 17Œ≤-pentanoate. Other common esters of estradiol in use include estradiol cypionate, estradiol enantate, and estradiol acetate, the former two of which are C17Œ≤ esters of estradiol similarly to estradiol valerate and the latter of which is the C3 acetate ester of estradiol. The experimental octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) of estradiol valerate is 5.6 to 6.3.http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical- Structure.13194.html History Estradiol valerate was patented by Ciba in 1940 and 1941, with a priority date of 1936.https://patents.google.com/patent/US2205627A/en It was synthesized and studied, along with a variety of other estradiol esters, by Karl Junkmann of Schering AG in 1953. The medication was first introduced for medical use via intramuscular injection in 1954 by Schering in Europe under the brand name Progynon Depot and by Squibb in the United States under the brand name Delestrogen. In 1966, oral estradiol valerate was introduced by Schering for medical use in Europe under the brand name Progynova. A report of its metabolism was published in 1967. Esterification of estradiol, as in estradiol valerate, improved its metabolic stability with oral administration, providing it with similar bioavailability and potency as oral micronized estradiol (1975).http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&ApplNo;=084499&DrugName;=ESTRACE&ActiveIngred;=ESTRADIOL&SponsorApplicant;=BRISTOL%20MYERS%20SQUIBB&ProductMktStatus;=3&goto;=Search.DrugDetails Along with estradiol benzoate (1933) and estradiol cypionate (1952), estradiol valerate is one of the most widely used esters of estradiol.

She served as Minister For Women and Minister for Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation from 2001 to 2006, when she became Minister of State for Housing. She held this post, and continued to represent the Tailevu South Lomaiviti Open Constituency in the House of Representatives until 5 December 2006, when the Military of Fiji staged a coup d'√©tat and removed her government from office. She had first won the seat for the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua Party (SDL) in the parliamentary election of September 2001.  Political controversies  Caucau is one of Fiji's most colourful politicians. A flamboyant figure, she is sometimes careless with her words and her outspokenness has frequently generated controversy. She has defended herself by claiming that journalists have often unfairly quoted her \\"out of context.\\" = \\"Indo-Fijians are like weeds\\" = On July 28, 2002, addressing Parliament, Caucau stated: :\\"A priest warned me that we must keep a careful and guarded watch over fellow Indo-Fijians because they are like weeds. They tend to push to grab to take over the land and the nation. [...] [T]his is what we, the indigenous people have proven and believe is the design of the foreigners [vulagi].\\"NGO Coalition of Human Rights, \\"Commentary on the Fiji Government Report\\", February 2003, in Papers on Racial Discrimination, vol.1, p.240 The term vulagi is a common slur against Indo-Fijians. Opposition members, journalists, trade unionists, non-governmental organisations and religious leaders called upon Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase to condemn Caucau's racist comment, and discipline her. Qarase refused to rebuke her publicly, saying that ruling on the propriety of her comments was the Parliamentary Speaker's prerogative, not his. \\"He decides whatever goes in the House and I have left the matter with him,\\" Qarase said. Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, however, condemned her remarks and called on the Prime Minister to discipline her. \\"Caucau's statements were irresponsible and unbecoming, especially from a woman who prays before making a statement,\\" Rabuka said. He called on her to apologise to the Indo-Fijian community. Responding to calls for an apology, Caucau insisted that she saw nothing offensive about her statement. \\"I am simply stating a fact and it was not meant to be racist\\", she told the media.\\"Christian Fijian Minister: Indians are Weeds\\" , Caribbean New Yorker, August 5, 2002 = Disagreements with the Military = On 14 April 2003, Radio New Zealand reported that Radio Fiji had quoted the Military commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, as having called for her resignation, following her open disagreement with military moves to prosecute perpetrators of the coup d'√©tat which deposed the elected government in May 2000. Caucau had expressed sympathy for some of the individuals imprisoned for their involvement in the coup, and had attempted to visit the chief instigator, George Speight at his Nukulau Island prison, later saying that she wanted to pray with him and the prisoners. = Call for journalists to be \\"responsible\\" = Caucau, who worked as journalist herself whilst pursuing her university studies in Nebraska in the United States, has periodically attacked the media for what she considers to be biased journalism. For the second time in less than a year, she declared at a workshop in Nabua in late January 2005 that reporters should be more sensitive when reporting incidents of violence against women, she said, and claimed to have been a frequent victim of journalists quoting her out of context. On the whole, journalists should attempt to focus a lot more on positive rather than negative news, she maintained. \\"I ask the media to concentrate on positive things rather than just doing the rounds on rape, incest, molestation on women,\\" she said. \\"There seems to be a lot of love-hate relationships in Fiji today, between so many and the media, simply because there are so many negative reporting and a serious lack of understanding on journalists' part on working on reports or their stories,\\" she added. Caucau likened negative journalism to \\"a bad wound that can fester and spread a nasty smell.\\" She said that journalists should be held accountable for the reports they produced. She was reiterating earlier comments she had made at the Pacific Regional Office for the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and AusAID. = Human trafficking allegations = Caucau found herself embroiled in controversy when she claimed at a workshop on violence against children on 27 September 2005 that fathers throughout Fiji have been selling their daughters into prostitution in a \\"readily available\\" human trafficking market. Her allegations came on top of claims by Opposition Senator Ponipate Lesavua that teenage prostitution was commonplace. Leader Mick Beddoes of the United Peoples Party and Kamlesh Arya, president of the Hindu Arya Pratindhi Sabha organization said that her claims were very serious, and that she should substantiate them with real facts. Beddoes called for a police investigation. = \\"Beggars are well-off\\" = Caucau made headlines again on 7 November 2005, claiming that many beggars were imposters. Many were professionals who already had food and shelter, she claimed. Some even allegedly owned and rented out houses to others. According to Caucau, all beggars except the mentally disabled received family allowances of up to F$100 per month, which put them above the poverty line. Some people were using the lifestyle of begging to make money, sometimes as much as F$35 per day, she said. The government had provided them with free training for basic skills, but they had simply moved back to the streets at the conclusion of their courses, she alleged, and some were pretending to be orphans or disabled in order to attract sympathy and pilfer. She called on the police to take them off the streets. At a question- and-answer session at the Fiji media Council Editors Forum on 8 December 2005, Caucau said that people should stop giving money to beggars. Most beggars were on the streets voluntarily, she said, in search of easy money. Giving them money only reinforced their handout mentality, she maintained. Fellow-panelist and Fiji Labour Party parliamentarian Pratap Chand disagreed with Caucau, saying that most beggars did not enjoy their lifestyle but had no choice.  Clash with Cakobau  The decision of the SDL Party to renominate Caucau for the parliamentary election, which was duly held on 6‚Äì13 May 2006, was sharply criticized by Ratu George Cakobau, scion of Tailevu's most senior chiefly family and son of former Governor-General Ratu Sir George Cakobau. The Fiji Village news service quoted him on 18 March as saying that she had done nothing for the people of Tailevu. The SDL disregarded his advice, and Caucau went on to retain her seat by a large majority.  Arrested in the United States  In July 2008, Caucau was arrested in the United States and charged with having committed an \\"assault with a deadly weapon\\" in San Francisco. She was due to face trial on August 18.\\"Ex-SDL minister to face US court\\" , Fijilive, July 30, 2008\\"US court sets trial date for Fiji ex-minister\\" , Fijilive, August 3, 2008  Christian  Caucau is the daughter of the Reverend Ratu Isireli Caucau, a former President of the Methodist Church. Caucau herself espouses fervent Christian beliefs, claims never to make a statement without praying first, preferably with her advisers, and frequently preaches. Caucau's religious convictions strongly flavour her social views. She has spoken out strongly in favour of campaigns to discourage premarital sex, claiming that single mothers are among the most vulnerable members of society and are frequently abused. She has also strongly opposed calls from some quarters to legalize prostitution, saying that it corrupts morals. In early October 2004, she claimed about half of all Members of Parliament were clients of prostitutes, but refused to name any names.

She established a Heathen organisation known as the Odinist Fellowship in the United States, where she lived for much of her life. A Third Positionist ideologue, she espoused the establishment of an anarcho-syndicalist society composed of racially Aryan communities. Born Else Ochsner in Esbjerg, Denmark, Christensen developed her anarcho-syndicalist sympathies while living in Copenhagen. From this position she moved toward the Strasserite National Bolshevik faction of the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark, which brought together a far-right emphasis on race with a left-wing approach to economics. In 1937 she married fellow Danish Nazi activist Aage Alex Christensen, however because of their National Bolshevik allegiances they were placed under heavy scrutiny amidst the German occupation of Denmark during World War II. After the war they moved to England and then Canada, settling in Toronto in 1951. Corresponding with various far right activists, she came upon the writings of the American far right ideologue Francis Parker Yockey and the Australian Odinist Alexander Rud Mills, both of whom had a profound influence on her. Christensen believed that Jews control the Western socio-political establishment, and felt that this would prevent the growth of any explicitly political movement to spread racial consciousness among those she deemed to be Aryan. Instead, she believed that Heathenry - a Pagan religion that she termed \\"Odinism\\" - represented the best way of spreading this racial consciousness. In 1969, Christensen and her husband founded a group called The Odinist Fellowship. Alex died in 1971, and Christensen continued her work, relocating to the United States. That year she began publication of a newsletter called The Odinist, which continued for many years. In 1993 she was imprisoned for drug smuggling, although maintained that she had been used as a drug mule without her knowledge. On release, she was deported to Canada, where she lived in Vancouver Island during her final years. Christensen exerted a significant influence over the racially oriented Odinist movement, gaining the moniker of the \\"Grand Mother\\" within that community. Her life and activities have been discussed in a number of academic studies of Odinism and the far right in North America by scholars like Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Mattias Gardell, and Jeffrey Kaplan. Biography =Early life: 1913-1968= Christensen was born as Else Oscher in 1913 in Esbjerg, western Denmark. She became a professional handweaver and in 1933 moved to Copenhagen. There, she embraced anarcho-syndicalism and became a follower of the anarcho-syndicalist ideologue Christian Christensen. Exposed to the various competing radical groups on both the far right and far left, she came under the increasing influence of the Strasserite wing within the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark (DNSAP), a group which had embraced the Nazi ideology of Germany's Nazi Party. In 1937 she married the woodcarver and unionist Aage Alex Christensen, who had served as the top lieutenant of the DNSAP leader Cay Lembcke. The Christensens became associated with the Strasserite National Bolshevik faction of the party, but Aage was part of the faction ousted when Frits Clausen seized control. A rally of the DNSAP, with whom Christensen was involved Following the German invasion of Denmark in 1940, both Else and Aage were arrested for the latter's involvement in National Bolshevist armed cells. Christensen was released after three days' interrogation, but Aage was convicted of illegal weapons' possession and detained for six months. At that point, Christensen convinced her father's cousin, who was Minister of Justice, that Aage should be released. Following the end of World War II, the couple left Denmark for England. In 1951 they migrated to Canada, where they settled in Toronto; here, Elsa worked in various hospitals, a vocation she retained throughout her life. Retaining an interest in class and race-based radicalism, she established contacts with various far right activists in the neighboring United States, including Willis Carto and James K. Warner, the latter being the New York organizer of the American Nazi Party. Warner had earlier attempted to establish Odinism as a religious wing of the American Nazi movement, but having believed this to be a failure he gave Christensen all of his leftover material on Odinism. It was in this material that Christensen came across the Call of Our Ancient Nordic Religion, a pamphlet authored by the Australian Odinist Alexander Rud Mills. Although Christensen believed that many of Mills' ideas were too heavily influenced by Freemasonry for her liking, she was profoundly influenced by his ideas about reviving the worship of ancient Norse deities. Her approach to the understanding of such deities would be heavily influenced by Jungian psychology, believing that the Norse deities were encoded in a collective unconscious of the white race. She was also influenced by the writing of the far right American theorist Francis Parker Yockey, in particular his 1962 work Imperium, in which he lamented the defeat of Nazi Germany and blamed it on the influence of Jews in Europe and the U.S. Influenced by Yockey, Christensen came to believe that Aryan culture had reached its \\"senility phase\\", personified by the ideologies of Christianity, communism, and capitalism, the belief that all human beings are equal, and the internationalist erosion of the distinct cultures of different races. She also read Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West, however she rejected Spengler's pessimistic view that this decline was terminal, instead opining that the Aryan civilization could be rejuvenated through its adoption of a new religion - Odinism. She deemed Odinism to be a religion that had a natural and intrinsic relationship with what she perceived to be a Northern European race, stating that the \\"primary source\\" of the faith was \\"biological: its genesis is in our race, its principles encoded in our genes.\\" She also believed that this Odinism should use Norse names for the deities rather than Anglo-Saxon or Teutonic ones in order to avoid the post-war animosity between England and Germany. =Odinist Fellowship: 1969-2005= Christensen established the Odinist Fellowship in 1969, then based from her mobile home in Crystal River, Florida. The academic specialist in the far right Jeffrey Kaplan termed it \\"the first organizational expression of racialist Odinism in the United States\\", while the religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein noted that Christensen created her version of Odinism as \\"a discrete vehicle to establish her cultural pessimist, anti-Semitic, and radical racial agenda in a religious cloak\\". In 1971, her husband died, after which she began to focus more fully on her Odinist activities. She began touring North America to promote Odinism, and in August 1971 released the first issue of her own magazine, The Odinist, which opened with the banner of \\"New Values from the Past\\". The Odinist focused heavily on right-wing issues, with Kaplan noting that commentaries on right-wing ideas, contemporary news, and anti-semitic ideas were \\"regular fare\\" within its pages, while explicit discussions of Odinist theology or Old Norse texts were \\"few and far between\\". The Pagan journalist Margot Adler deemed The Odinist to be \\"frankly racist, although they probably would have preferred the term 'racialist'.\\" Christensen believed that Odinism was the ideal tool for the advancement of Aryan racial consciousness, expressing her opinion that the Jewish-controlled establishment would not permit her to do it a more explicit way, stating that \\"You cannot repeat the mistake that Hitler made [of explicitly attacking the Jews] ... Everybody knows that the Jews rule the whole damned world, so you cannot fight their combined power. You need to watch your step.\\" A number of The Odinist's readers wrote letters to the magazine expressing disapproval of what they perceived as the editors' support of Nazism, to which Christensen publicly responded that such accusations were \\"the cheapest of all shots that can be aimed against anyone who finds something positive to say about ... National Socialism ... or who merely desires some degree of objectivity in dealing with this grossly maligned movement.\\" In the early 1970s, Christensen got in contact with Valgard Murray and Elton Hall, Heathens operating a kindred in Arizona, and in 1976 their group would be the first to be certified by the Odinist Fellowship. During the early 1980s she established a prison-outreach program in the hope of attracting incarcerated individuals to Odinism, in doing so getting Odinism legal recognition as a religion from the state of Florida. In the prisons, the Odinist Fellowship organised four seasonal festivals a year that were marked with sumbel as well as commemorating Hitler's birthday. 280px In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, and sentenced to five years, four months imprisonment for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed that she had been driving a car from Texas to Florida as a favor to friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly. After serving her sentence, she was deported to Canada, something which left her feeling bitter. There, Max Hyatt, the gothi of the Asatru Alliance-affiliated group Wodan's Kindred, invited her to live at his home in Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, after personal and political differences surfaced, Christensen left Hyatt's home and moved into an RV park in Parksville, Vancouver Island, where she lived in a small trailer. Despite being far less involved in Odinic activities than she had been previously, she set about trying to revive the Odinist Fellowship. In 1998 she began publication of Midgard Page, which was produced in both paper and electronic copies, the latter of which was housed on Hyatt's Wodansdaeg Press website. During her later years, she became more moderate in her views, encouraging a cultural change among Aryans rather than political actions. This contrasted with the more radical views of newer groups like Wotansvolk, who embraced militant action to bring about socio-political change. She died on May 4, 2005. Ideology Else Christensen's memorial stone placed at the Odinist Community of Spain ‚Äî √Åsatr√∫ temple in Albacete, Spain. The scholar of religion Jefferson F. Calico noted that Christen pursued \\"a political, racially based Heathenry\\", while the historian of religion Mattias Gardell believed that Christensen's Odinism represented a separate Heathen tendency to McNallen's Asatru, characterising Christensen's version as \\"a more political and racial interpretation with notable national socialist influences\\". He noted that Christensen viewed the religion as a means through which to bring about \\"racial unification and rejuvenation\\". Her approach to Odinism focused largely on the study of books rather than on spiritual experiences gained through ritual, and she rejected the claims of other Heathens that they are visited by anthropomorphic gods, dismissing these claims as signs of lunacy. Christensen believed that the present power structure of society was going to collapse, and that racial-oriented Odinists should be prepared for this. She believed that revolutionary activity to overthrow oppressive governments is a natural instinct for Aryans, as was reflected \\"from Jefferson to Hitler.\\" Although she approved of its attitude to race, she believed that the example of Nazi Germany was not one that should be emulated because of its totalitarian structure and alliance with capitalists. Instead she expressed favorable comments regarding the economically left-wing policies of the early Benito Mussolini government in Italy, and of the Strasserite National Bolshevik factions within Germany's Nazi Party. She expressed the view that Hitler's regime did not reach its \\"true potential\\" and that instead it should have retained its \\"original, socialist and folkish agenda\\". In espousing an anti-totalitarian and anti-capitalist attitude that favored a de-centralized societal organization, Christensen reflected her anarchist values. Describing her ideal social situation as \\"tribal socialism\\", she envisioned a world in which white people lived in small, self-sufficient \\"tribal\\" Odinist rural communes, each of which was autonomous, and in which private enterprise was permitted but resources and social responsibilities were shared. She believed that the societies of ancient Northern Europe had been similarly anarchistic in nature, expressing the view that this anarchist emphasis on freedom was intrinsic to the \\"nature\\" of Aryan people; in this way her attitude differed strongly from the anti-racist perspective of most anarchists. Christensen expressed the opinion that these communities should be racially homogenous and should exhibit \\"racial consciousness\\", opining that in a voluntary social order, no one would want to live alongside those of a different race. Although denying that she was a white supremacist, she was clear about being a white separatist. She argued for a ban on inter-racial marriage, with the intent on keeping the 'Aryan' race \\"pure\\". This preoccupation with concepts of purity was common within the National Socialist milieu, exhibiting itself not only in racial terms but also environmental ones too. Christensen rejected capitalism, consumerism, and materialism, believing in the need for ecological awareness, a back-to-the-earth ethos, and sustainable production. Legacy and influence The historian of esotericism Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke described Christensen as \\"the most public voice of Odinism in the United States from the early 1970s onward\\", while in 2003 Gardell stated that the Odinist Fellowship was \\"the oldest organization\\" on the Heathen scene. Calico noted that Christen was responsible for bringing Folkish Heathenry to the United States and influenced \\"many of the first generation of leaders who built a truly American Heathen movement\\". She represented, according to Calico, \\"a bridge between the American Odinist scene and the intellectual lineage of the Germanic v√∂lkisch movement.\\" Christensen came to be known as the \\"Grand Mother\\" among racially oriented Odinists, with many paying homage to her even if they had sought out a more aggressive approach to racial issues than that which she adopted. Alternately, many in the Odinist community know her as the \\"Folk Mother\\". A number of her ideas proved to be key influences on the American Odinist movement, most notably her political and economic \\"tribal socialism\\", her emphasis on recruiting people through prison ministries, and her emphasis on a Jungian archetypal interpretation of the Norse deities. Christensen had a great importance on the formation of modern Paganism in Spain, in recognition within the Odinist orthodoxy the Spanish Odinist Circle,http://www.observatorioreligion.es/upload/99/41/CastilllaMancha.pdf pag.311 religion.es. Minor√≠as religiosas en Castilla-La Mancha which became the Comunidad Odinista de Espa√±a-Asatru, that got official acceptance in 2010, i.e., full recognition and equality with other faiths recognized by the Spanish state, was considered by her followers in Spain as \\"Mother Folk\\". The day of her death is an official day of worship in the Odinist faith in Spain.http://asatru.es/?p=1909 letter by Else Chistensen to Odinist Spanish Circlehttp://asatru.es/origenes-y-fundacion-2/ reference about Else Christensen References =Notes= =Footnotes= =Sources=    * Category:1913 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Adherents of Germanic neopaganism Category:Danish neopagans Category:Founders of neopagan movements Category:People from Esbjerg Category:People from Crystal River, Florida Category:Third Position Category:National syndicalists Category:White nationalists Category:Advocates of conspiracy theories involving Jews Category:Neo-fascists Category:Danish neo-Nazis Category:Female religious leaders ","title":"Else Christensen"},{"id":"2428862","text":"Take My Eyes (, literally I Give You My Eyes) is a 2003 Spanish romantic drama film directed by Ic√≠ar Bolla√≠n, starring Laia Marull and Luis Tosar.

History Founded in 1123 in a place formerly called Locus Diaboli (Latin for \\"devil's place\\") due to the large number of dolmens around it, it was renamed Locus Dei in Latin by the monks, which in French became Loc-Dieu, both meaning the \\"place of God\\". Burnt down by the English in 1409, it was rebuilt in 1470, and the abbey was fortified. The abbey was suppressed and its assets sold off as national property by the French government during the French Revolution in 1793. The Cibiel family bought it in 1812, and Cibiel descendants still live in it today. The buildings were restored in 1840 (the east wing) and in 1880 (the south and west wings). In the summer of 1940, paintings from the Louvre, including the Mona Lisa, were hidden in Loc-Dieu to keep them safe from German troops. The abbey and its large park are now open to visitors. Architecture *Church: built between 1159 and 1189, the church remains intact. This is one of the first Gothic buildings in southern France, designed by architects from Burgundy. Cistercian rules are followed, i.e. the greatest simplicity possible, with no decorations other than the stone and light. *Cloister and Chapter room: rebuilt in 1470, they replaced the previous Romanesque cloister.

He wrote in vernacular Cretan dialect (Cretan Greek), and was a leading figure of the Cretan Renaissance. Vitsentzos Kornaros is considered to be the greatest of all the Cretan poets and one of the most significant and influential figures in the entire course of Greek poetry. The son of a Venetian-Cretan aristocrat and a scion of the noble Venetian family of Cornaro, he was born near Sitia, Crete in 1553. Later, when he married, he came to live in Candia (now Heraklion) where he joined the Accademia dei Stravaganti. Kornaros died in 1613 (or 1614), just before his contemporaries, William Shakespeare and Miguel de Cervantes. Biography Not many biographic sources exist about Kornaros apart from the last verses of Erotokritos. It is believed that he was born to a wealthy family in Trapezonda (), a village near Sitia, Crete, in 1553, and lived there roughly up to 1590. He then moved to Candia (modern Iraklion), where his marriage to Marietta Zeno took place. Together they had two daughters named Helen and Katerina. In 1591 Kornaros became an administrator, and during the outbreak of plague from 1591 to 1593 he worked as a sanitary supervisor. He showed interest in literature and was a member of a literary group called Accademia degli Stravaganti (Academy of the Strange Ones), which was founded by his brother and fellow writer Andrea Cornaro, who wrote in Italian language. He died in Candia, in 1613 (or 1614), and was buried at the church of San Francesco. The cause of his death remains unknown. Alternate spellings of his first name include Vincenzo, Vitzentzos or Vikentios. Kornaros' \\"Erotokritos\\" was a source of inspiration for Dionysios Solomos and influenced Greek poets such as Kostis Palamas, Krystallis and Seferis.

In 1921 he received a master's degree in naval architecture from MIT, and was assigned to the Navy Construction Corps. McKee was assigned to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard following graduation, and then transferred to the New London, Connecticut, submarine base in 1924. McKee became ship type assistant of submarine design for the Navy Bureau of Construction and Repair in Washington from 1926 to 1930, where he directed the design of USS Dolphin (SS-169) from which evolved the successful fleet submarines of World War II.Alden, John D., CDR USN \\"Andrew Irwin McKee, Naval Constructor\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings June 1979 pp.51‚Äì52 McKee served as new construction superintendent at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from 1930 to 1934 and as hull superintendent at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard from 1934 to 1938.Alden, John D., CDR USN \\"Andrew Irwin McKee, Naval Constructor\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings June 1979 p.53 In the latter post, he oversaw introduction of the all-welded pressure hull techniques pioneered while building the USS Sturgeon (SS-187).

She was later described as \\"France's most accomplished female aviator\\", setting a woman's record for loops done in an hour. The French government eventually recognized her with the Legion of Honor and other awards. Since her death, she has been commemorated with a postage stamp. Born into a large family outside Paris, she became a pilot in her twenties to pay off gambling debts. An early crossing of the English Channel led Ren√© Caudron, her employer, to send her to South America to demonstrate his planes, where she made her Andes crossing, assisted, she later said, by a tip relayed to her from a medium. Later in her life she became involved in leftist political causes, and eventually became part of the French Resistance. Early life She was born in 1895 in Arcueil, outside Paris, the youngest of seven, to Belgian √©migr√©s. She developed an independent, assertive streak in her childhood, as it was difficult to get her father's attention. In the house she was known as \\"the little terror.\\" \\"No one could change my mind. I kept saying, 'I won't give up,\\" she recalled later. \\"It served me well in life; I never gave in.\\" As she grew into adulthood, that drive found its outlet in partying and gambling. During a drinking session after losing all her money at the race track, she expressed the desire to be a pilot. A friend present suggested she go work for Caudron, France's first airplane manufacturer. She could learn to fly and get paid, taking care of her financial problems. Aviation career Bolland went to Caudron's headquarters at Le Crotoy, on the English Channel in northern France, and signed up for flying lessons. A typographical error added the second \\"l\\" to her name, which she kept for the rest of her life. She earned her pilot's license in two months. While her instructors saw great potential as a pilot, on the ground she continued to be difficult to get along with, sometimes physically attacking those she disagreed with. She was often grounded for disciplinary reasons. \\"I became a different person in an airplane. I felt small, humble,\\" she said later. \\"Because on the ground, the truth is, I was totally insufferable.\\" alt=A small yellow biplane with steel latticework serving as the fuselage between the cockpit and tail After earning her license, she went to work for Ren√© Caudron doing what the other pilots did, mostly delivering and picking up planes. But she wanted to fly her own plane for him, and told her so. He pointed to one of his G.3s and said that if she could perform a loop, it was hers to fly for him. When she did, Caudron realized that having an attractive young woman flying his planes would be an excellent way to demonstrate how easy they were to fly. He told her to fly it over the English Channel. On the way there, she went to Brussels to spend the night celebrating with her friends. The next morning, newspapers reported that she was feared lost at sea. \\"I may have drowned last night,\\" she quipped in response, \\"but not in water.\\" The next day, 25 August 1920, she flew across the Channel, repeating Harriet Quimby's 1912 feat. Caudron then asked her to go to Argentina to do demonstration flights. After she arrived, Bolland began planning her Andes flight. The G3s that had been sent along to Argentina with her had been designed for use as military observation aircraft during World War I. Fragile and powered by Le Rh√¥ne 80 hp engines, they were not ideal for the trip, and she asked Caudron to send others. He said it was impossible. When she finally took off from Mendoza on 1 April 1921, she had 40 hours of flight time and neither maps nor any knowledge of the area. The night before, Bolland said later, a Brazilian woman claiming to be a worker of French descent who had never even seen an airplane before had visited her in her Buenos Aires hotel room. She thought the shy woman was trying to discourage her and told her she had as long as it would take to smoke a cigarette for the Brazilian woman to say what she had to say. The woman told her that on her flight, when she saw an oyster-shaped lake, to turn left towards a steep mountain face that resembled an overturned chair. \\"If you turn right, you're lost.\\" Pilots had been attempting to cross the Andes since 1913, and the National Congress of Chile had offered a prize of 50,000 pesos for the first successful crossing of the range by a Chilean (if no foreigner had done so first) between the 31st and 35th parallels, where the highest peaks lay. Chilean Army officer Dagoberto Godoy claimed the prize in 1918. alt=A view downward of rocky, jagged mountains with some snow cover Bolland's flight was especially challenging. The G.3 could not fly much higher than , well below the range's summits, which reach up to at Aconcagua, South America's highest peak. So, she had to fly between and around them and through valleys, a riskier route than Godoy and her predecessors had chosen. The flight suit and pajamas she wore under her leather jacket were stuffed with newspapers, which proved incapable of keeping her warm. The plane had no windshield, and the blood vessels in her lips and nose burst from the cold air at that altitude during the four-hour flight. Seeing the oyster-shaped lake she had been warned about, with a valley leading to the right she did as she had been advised and turned toward the mountain face. \\"I had to choose; I don't know why I trusted the girl from Buenos Aires,\\" she said many years later. \\"I turned left, thinking to myself: to think I'll crash for such a stupid reason.\\" But the wind lifted her up just before she struck the mountain, and a break in the mountains soon appeared, beyond which were the plains of Chile. Later she learned the young woman had been sent to her by a medium. \\"Make whatever you will of it. I still don't believe in the occult sciences. But you have to admit that it takes some effort to not believe!\\" She landed in Santiago, the capital. Many people had gathered to celebrate the feat. The French consul, who had believed it was an April Fool's Day joke, was not among them. She was called \\"the goddess of the Andes\\" by the celebrants, but dismissed the acclaim. \\"I said to myself: this is glory? It's nothing. Glory isn't worth anything compared to the inner joy of accomplishing something.\\" Bolland's accomplishment went largely unnoticed in her homeland at the time. Two years later, Ren√© Caudron's new wife got jealous of her and pressured her husband into firing her. In 1924, she was created a Knight of the Legion of Honor in belated recognition of her Andes flight. She continued to fly, setting a women's record of 212 loops tying with ten other pilots, all men, in an 18-flight, race around France the next year. In 1930, she was taking another woman on her first flight near Le Bourget when the engine failed. As she was attempting to land, the plane hit some telegraph wires, knocking it off course. Bolland was able to land the plane on the roof of a nearby shed and restrain her panicked passenger. Both women escaped unharmed; the plane was damaged beyond repair. Later life In 1930 she married another aviator, Ernest Vinchon. Her combative nature continued to polarize those who knew her; a 1933 accident she survived was later ruled to have been the result of sabotage. She and her husband became active in leftist political causes throughout the decade. They supported suffragist Louise Weiss, and later the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. During World War II they remained in France and were part of the resistance. She remained humble about her Andes flight. On its 50th anniversary, in 1971, she told a journalist who asked about it that \\"[u]ltimately, it doesn't interest me. I'm much more interested in what's happening now than 50 years ago.\\" She died in Paris in 1975. Legacy In addition to the awards she received throughout her lifetime, she has been recognized more recently. A street and lyc√©e have been named for her in Poissy, another Paris suburb. In 2005 La Poste, the French postal service, issued a stamp honoring her. The new Paris Tramway, T3, due to come into operation on 15 December 2012, have named nine of the 26 stops after notable women, and on the boulevard Mortier in the 20th arrondissement there is one named in her honour.

It is claimed to have started from a 1955 discussion between three undergraduates of St John's College, all either Royal Navy or Royal Marines, and a group of medical students of unknown college affiliation. The discussion centred on the drinking capacity of the human male, one of the medical students asserting that the male bladder could hold no more than four pints. The St John's students disagreed in principle and the group agreed to settle the argument by meeting on a specified evening and having a drink in every pub on King Street. After reportedly carrying out the feat of having a drink at each pub without stopping to urinate, the King Street Pint to Pint Club was formally constituted, with the basic objective drinking a pint of ale in seven of the street's pubs before returning for an eighth in the pub you started in. The club set rules to be observed for the duration of drinking, among which was a penalty pint awarded for the commission of either of the two Ps, ‚Äúpeeing or puking‚Äù. Successful members of the club wore a special navy blue tie decorated with the image of a tankard surmounted by a crown. The tie soon became a highly sought after item of apparel.

Tissue formation during embryonic development, wound healing and immune responses all require the orchestrated movement of cells in particular directions to specific locations. Cells often migrate in response to specific external signals, including chemical signals and mechanical signals. Errors during this process have serious consequences, including intellectual disability, vascular disease, tumor formation and metastasis. An understanding of the mechanism by which cells migrate may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for controlling, for example, invasive tumour cells. Due to the highly viscous environment (low Reynolds number), cells need to continuously produce forces in order to move. Cells achieve active movement by very different mechanisms. Many less complex prokaryotic organisms (and sperm cells) use flagella or cilia to propel themselves. Eukaryotic cell migration typically is far more complex and can consist of combinations of different migration mechanisms. It generally involves drastic changes in cell shape which are driven by the cytoskeleton. Two very distinct migration scenarios are crawling motion (most commonly studied) and blebbing motility. online A paradigmatic example of crawling motion is the case of fish epidermal keratocytes, which have been extensively used in research and teaching. Cell migration studies The migration of cultured cells attached to a surface or in 3D is commonly studied using microscopy. As cell movement is very slow, a few ¬µm/minute, time-lapse microscopy videos are recorded of the migrating cells to speed up the movement. Such videos (Figure 1) reveal that the leading cell front is very active, with a characteristic behavior of successive contractions and expansions. It is generally accepted that the leading front is the main motor that pulls the cell forward. =Common features= The processes underlying mammalian cell migration are believed to be consistent with those of (non- spermatozooic) locomotion. Observations in common include: * cytoplasmic displacement at leading edge (front) * laminar removal of dorsally-accumulated debris toward trailing edge (back) The latter feature is most easily observed when aggregates of a surface molecule are cross-linked with a fluorescent antibody or when small beads become artificially bound to the front of the cell. Other eukaryotic cells are observed to migrate similarly. The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is useful to researchers because they consistently exhibit chemotaxis in response to cyclic AMP; they move more quickly than cultured mammalian cells; and they have a haploid genome that simplifies the process of connecting a particular gene product with its effect on cellular behaviour. Two different models for how cells move. A) Cytoskeletal model. B) Membrane Flow Model (A) Dynamic microtubules are necessary for tail retraction and are distributed at the rear end in a migrating cell. Green, highly dynamic microtubules; yellow, moderately dynamic microtubules and red, stable microtubules. (B) Stable microtubules act as struts and prevent tail retraction and thereby inhibit cell migration. Molecular processes of migration There are two main theories for how the cell advances its front edge: the cytoskeletal model and membrane flow model. It is possible that both underlying processes contribute to cell extension. =Cytoskeletal model (A)= =Leading edge= Experimentation has shown that there is rapid actin polymerisation at the cell's front edge. This observation has led to the hypothesis that formation of actin filaments \\"push\\" the leading edge forward and is the main motile force for advancing the cell's front edge. In addition, cytoskeletal elements are able to interact extensively and intimately with a cell's plasma membrane. =Trailing edge= Other cytoskeletal components (like microtubules) have important functions in cell migration. It has been found that microtubules act as ‚Äústruts‚Äù that counteract the contractile forces that are needed for trailing edge retraction during cell movement. When microtubules in the trailing edge of cell are dynamic, they are able to remodel to allow retraction. When dynamics are suppressed, microtubules cannot remodel and, therefore, oppose the contractile forces. The morphology of cells with suppressed microtubule dynamics indicate that cells can extend the front edge (polarized in the direction of movement), but have difficulty retracting their trailing edge. On the other hand, high drug concentrations, or microtubule mutations that depolymerize the microtubules, can restore cell migration but there is a loss of directionality. It can be concluded that microtubules act both to restrain cell movement and to establish directionality. =Membrane flow model (B)= Studies have also shown that the front of the migration is the site at which the membrane is returned to the cell surface from internal membrane pools at the end of the endocytic cycle. This has led to the hypothesis that extension of the leading edge occurs primarily by addition of membrane at the front of the cell. If so, the actin filaments that form at the front might stabilize the added membrane so that a structured extension, or lamella, is formed rather than a bubble-like structure (or bleb) at its front. For a cell to move, it is necessary to bring a fresh supply of \\"feet\\" (proteins called integrins, which attach a cell to the surface on which it is crawling) to the front. It is likely that these feet are endocytosed toward the rear of the cell and brought to the cell's front by exocytosis, to be reused to form new attachments to the substrate. Rearward membrane flow (red arrows) and vesicle trafficking from back to front (blue arrows) drive adhesion-independent migration. =Mechanistic basis of amoeboid migration= Adhesive crawling is not the only migration mode exhibited by eukaryotic cells. Importantly, metastatic cancer cells and immune cells like macrophages and neutrophils have been found to be capable of adhesion-independent migration. The mechanistic basis of this migration mode is less understood than either eukaryotic cell crawling or flagella-based swimming by microorganisms. The physicist E. M. Purcell theorized that under conditions of low Reynolds number fluid dynamics, which apply at the cellular scale, rearward surface flow could provide a mechanism for microscopic objects to swim forward. After some decades, experimental support for this model was provided using optogenetics. It was shown that cells migrating in an amoeboid fashion without adhesions exhibit plasma membrane flow towards the cell rear that can propel cells by exerting tangential forces on the surrounding fluid. Polarized trafficking of membrane-containing vesicles from the rear to the front of the cell helps maintain cell size. Rearward membrane flow was also observed in Dictyostelium discoideum cells. Interestingly, the migration of supracellular clusters has also been found to be supported by a similar mechanism of rearward surface flow. Schematic representation of the collective biomechanical and molecular mechanism of cell motion =Collective biomechanical and molecular mechanism of cell motion= Based on some mathematical models, recent studies hypothesize a novel biological model for collective biomechanical and molecular mechanism of cell motion. It is proposed that microdomains weave the texture of cytoskeleton and their interactions mark the location for formation of new adhesion sites. According to this model, microdomain signaling dynamics organizes cytoskeleton and its interaction with substratum. As microdomains trigger and maintain active polymerization of actin filaments, their propagation and zigzagging motion on the membrane generate a highly interlinked network of curved or linear filaments oriented at a wide spectrum of angles to the cell boundary. It is also proposed that microdomain interaction marks the formation of new focal adhesion sites at the cell periphery. Myosin interaction with the actin network then generate membrane retraction/ruffling, retrograde flow, and contractile forces for forward motion. Finally, continuous application of stress on the old focal adhesion sites could result in the calcium-induced calpain activation, and consequently the detachment of focal adhesions which completes the cycle. Polarity in migrating cells Migrating cells have a polarity‚Äîa front and a back. Without it, they would move in all directions at once, i.e. spread. How this polarity is formulated at a molecular level inside a cell is unknown. In a cell that is meandering in a random way, the front can easily give way to become passive as some other region, or regions, of the cell form(s) a new front. In chemotaxing cells, the stability of the front appears enhanced as the cell advances toward a higher concentration of the stimulating chemical. This polarity is reflected at a molecular level by a restriction of certain molecules to particular regions of the inner cell surface. Thus, the phospholipid PIP3 and activated Rac and CDC42 are found at the front of the cell, whereas Rho GTPase and PTEN are found toward the rear. It is believed that filamentous actins and microtubules are important for establishing and maintaining a cell's polarity. Drugs that destroy actin filaments have multiple and complex effects, reflecting the wide role that these filaments play in many cell processes. It may be that, as part of the locomotory process, membrane vesicles are transported along these filaments to the cell's front. In chemotaxing cells, the increased persistence of migration toward the target may result from an increased stability of the arrangement of the filamentous structures inside the cell and determine its polarity. In turn, these filamentous structures may be arranged inside the cell according to how molecules like PIP3 and PTEN are arranged on the inner cell membrane. And where these are located appears in turn to be determined by the chemoattractant signals as these impinge on specific receptors on the cell's outer surface. Although microtubules have been known to influence cell migration for many years, the mechanism by which they do so has remained controversial. On a planar surface, microtubules are not needed for the movement, but they are required to provide directionality to cell movement and efficient protrusion of the leading edge. When present, microtubules retard cell movement when their dynamics are suppressed by drug treatment or by tubulin mutations.  Inverse problems in the context of cell motility  An area of research called inverse problems in cell motility has been established. This approach is based on the idea that behavioral or shape changes of a cell bear information about the underlying mechanisms that generate these changes. Reading cell motion, namely, understanding the underlying biophysical and mechanochemical processes, is of paramount importance. The mathematical models developed in these works determine some physical features and material properties of the cells locally through analysis of live cell image sequences and uses this information to make further inferences about the molecular structures, dynamics, and processes within the cells, such as the actin network, microdomains, chemotaxis, adhesion, and retrograde flow.

At the time of the sinking, Patria was carrying about 1,800 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe whom the British authorities were deporting from Mandatory Palestine to Mauritius because they lacked entry permits. Zionist organizations opposed the deportation, and the underground paramilitary Haganah group planted a bomb intended to disable the ship to prevent it from leaving Haifa. The Haganah claims to have miscalculated the effects of the explosion. The bomb blew the steel frame off one full side of the ship and the ship sank in less than 16 minutes, trapping hundreds in the hold. The British allowed the survivors to remain in Palestine on humanitarian grounds. Who was responsible and the true reason why Patria sank remained controversial mysteries until 1957, when Munya Mardor, the person who planted the bomb, published a book about his experiences. Background Before the government of Nazi Germany decided in 1941 to exterminate all Jews in Europe, its policy allowed the reduction of Jewish numbers in Europe by emigration. Jewish organizations, both mainstream and dissident, ran operations that tried to bring Jews from Europe to Palestine in violation of the immigration rules applied by the British government. This required cooperation with the Nazi authorities, who saw the opportunity to make trouble for Britain as well as to get rid of Jews. The Zentralstelle f√ºr j√ºdische Auswanderung (Central Office for Jewish Emigration or ZjA) worked under the supervision of Adolf Eichmann, organizing Jewish emigration from the Nazi-controlled parts of Europe. In September 1940 the ZjA chartered three ships, , and , to take Jewish refugees from the Romanian port of Tulcea to Palestine. Their passengers consisted of about 3,600 refugees from the Jewish communities of Vienna, Danzig and Prague. Pacific reached Palestinian waters on 1 November, followed by Milos a few days later. The Royal Navy intercepted the ships and escorted them to the port of Haifa. Warned in advance of the ships' arrival, the British Colonial Office was determined to refuse entry to the immigrants. With the security situation in the region improving following British successes in the Western Desert Campaign, the Colonial Office decided it was less risky to provoke Jewish anger than to risk an Arab revolt, and that an example would be made to dissuade other potential immigrants from making the attempt. The British High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Harold MacMichael, issued a deportation order on 20 November, ordering that the refugees be taken to the British Indian Ocean territory of Mauritius and the Caribbean territory of Trinidad. The refugees were transferred to another ship, SS Patria, for the voyage to Mauritius. Patria was an 11,885-ton ocean liner dating from 1913 that the French company Messageries Maritimes ran between Marseille and the Levant. She had reached the Port of Haifa shortly before Italy declared war on France and Britain, and then remained in port for safety. After the French surrender to Nazi Germany the British authorities in Haifa first detained Patria and then seized her for use as a troop ship. As a civilian liner she was permitted to carry 805 people including her crew, but after being requisitioned she was authorised to carry 1,800 troops (excluding the crew). She still only had enough lifeboats for the original 805 passengers and crew, so these were supplemented with liferafts. The refugees from Pacific and Milos were soon transferred to Patria. Atlantic arrived on 24 November and the transfer of eight hundred of its 1,645 passengers began. Disaster Graves of some of the victims of the sinking Meanwhile, Zionist organizations were considering how to thwart the deportation plan. A general strike had little effect. The Irgun tried unsuccessfully to place a bomb on Patria to disable her. The Haganah also sought to disable Patria, with the intention of forcing her to stay in port for repairs and thus gaining time to press the British to rescind the deportation order. The Haganah officer in charge of the operation was Yitzhak Sadeh, authorised by Moshe Sharett, who led the Political Department of the Jewish Agency in the temporary absence of David Ben-Gurion, who had left for the United States on 22 September and did not return until 13 February 1941. On 22 November Haganah agents smuggled a bomb aboard the ship, timed to explode at 9 p.m. that day. It failed, so a second, more powerful bomb was smuggled aboard on 24 November and hidden next to the ship's inner hull. At 9 a.m. on 25 November, it exploded. The Haganah had miscalculated the effect of the charge and it blew a large hole measuring in the ship's side, sinking her in only 16 minutes. When the bomb exploded, Patria was carrying 1,770 refugees transferred from Pacific and Milos and had taken on board 134 passengers from Atlantic. Most were rescued by British and Arab boats that rushed to the scene. However, 267 people were declared missing ‚Äì over 200 Jewish refugees plus 50 crew and British soldiers ‚Äì and another 172 were injured. Many of the dead were trapped in Patrias hold and were unable to escape as she rolled on her side and sank. 209 bodies were eventually recovered and buried in Haifa. Aftermath The surviving refugees from Patria, together with the remaining 1,560 passengers of Atlantic, were taken to the Atlit detainee camp. Later, after an international campaign, the survivors of Patria were given permits to stay in Palestine. However, the other Atlantic passengers were deported to Mauritius on 9 December. After the war they were given the choice of where to go; 81% chose Palestine and arrived there in August 1945. In December 1945 Ha-Po'el ha-Tza'ir (\\"Young Worker\\") a Mapai party newspaper, commented \\"On one bitter and impetuous day, a malicious hand sank the ship\\". The comment was written by the deputy editor, Israel Cohen, who did not know that all of the people responsible were Mapai leaders. Angered by the newspaper's comments, some Haganah leaders sent Ben-Gurion's son Amos to the newspaper office where he slapped the editor, Isaac Lofven, across the face. A nameplate preserved from Patria A bitter debate over the correctness of the operation raged in secret within the Zionist leadership. The decision had been made by an activist faction, without consulting more moderate members according to normal procedure, and this caused serious internal divisions that persisted for many years. An effort was made to enshrine the incident as an icon of Zionist determination, but this largely failed. As early as 15 December 1945 Isaac Lofven warned a Mapai meeting against trying to \\"sanctify\\" the tragedy. Some leaders of the Yishuv (the Jewish community in Palestine) argued that the loss of life had not been in vain, as Patrias survivors had been allowed to stay in the country. Others declared that the Haganah had had no right to risk the lives of the immigrants, as they had not decided of their own free will to become participants in the underground Jewish conflict with the British authorities. The Haganah's role was not publicly revealed and a story was put out that the deportees, out of despair, had sunk the ship themselves (the version recounted, for example, by Arthur Koestler). For years Britain believed the Irgun was probably responsible. The Haganah's role was finally publicly disclosed in 1957 when Munya Mardor, the operative who had planted the bomb, wrote an account of his activities in the Jewish underground. He recounted, \\"There was never any intent to cause the ship to sink. The British would have used this against the Jewish population and show it as an act of sabotage against the war effort\\". He said that it was in the highest interest of the Haganah to fight the sanctions of the British White Paper of 1939, and the primary objective was to avoid casualties. The British estimated 267 people were killed, but neither the Jewish Agency nor the Haganah could establish how many people escaped the sinking and how many had died. Munya Mardor continued to work at the port in order to remove suspicion from himself. The Haganah also put up an investigative body to find out why such a relatively small amount of explosives could create such a large hole in the ship. The Haganah investigators concluded that the boat's superstructure was in poor condition, and therefore unable to withstand the pressure of the explosion. Rudolf Hirsch, a Jewish-German writer who had emigrated to Palestine in 1939, was a close associate of Arnold Zweig there, and later remigrated with Zweig to East Germany, published a novel about the incident, Patria Israel, in which he also explicitly refers to Mardor's account.

The workstation software consisted of a virtual machine suite for Intel x86-compatible computers which allowed the creation and execution of multiple x86 virtual computers simultaneously. Each virtual machine instance could execute its own guest operating system including Windows, Linux, OS/2 and BSD variants. Description The computer and operating system instance that executes the twoOStwo process is referred to as the host machine. Instances of operating systems running inside a virtual machine are referred to as guest virtual machines. Like an emulator, twoOStwo provides a completely virtualized set of hardware to the guest operating system; for example, irrespective of make and model of the physical network adapter, the guest machine will see a Novell/Eagle NE2000 or Realtek RTL8029(AS) network adapter. twoOStwo virtualizes all devices within the virtual environment, including the video adapter, network adapter, and hard disk adapters. It also provides pass- through drivers for serial and parallel devices. Because all guest virtual machines use the same hardware drivers irrespective of the actual hardware on the host computer, virtual machine instances are highly portable between computers. For example, a running virtual machine can be stopped, copied to another physical computer, and started. Implementation Conventional emulators like Bochs emulate the microprocessor, executing each guest CPU instruction by calling a software subroutine on the host machine that simulates the function of that CPU instruction. This level of abstraction allows the guest machine to run on host machines with a different type of microprocessor, but is also very slow. A more efficient approach consists in software debugger technique. Some parts of the code are executed natively on the real processor; on 'bad' instructions, there are software interrupts that break execution of the guest operating system code and that particular instruction is emulated. twoOStwo, as well as VMware Workstation, Virtual PC for Windows and QEMU with the kqemu add-on, take an even more optimized approach and run code directly when this is possible. This is the case for user mode and virtual 8086 mode code on x86. The drawback is that the guest OS has to be compatible with the host CPU. So unlike an emulator, one cannot use twoOStwo to run classic Mac OS/PowerPC software on an Intel x86 processor. Another drawback is that it is not normally possible to efficiently nest virtual machines. Finally, although twoOStwo virtual machines run in user mode, twoOStwo itself requires installing various device drivers in the host operating system. Features Besides bridging to network adapters, CD-ROM readers and hard disk drives, twoOStwo also provides the ability to simulate some hardware. For example, an ISO image can be mounted as a CDROM and .hdd files can be mounted as hard disks.

After finding a treasure, Uncle Fyodor can afford to buy a tractor that runs on soup and potatoes, and a portable sun to do the heating during the winter. The book was made into a successful animated film, Three from Prostokvashino (and its two sequels). Uspensky continued with Uncle Fyodor in other books, which have not, however, been as successful. Uspensky published other books with human-like animal characters.

As the naked eye may not be able to determine which of the competitors crossed the line first, a photo or video taken at the finish line may be used for a more accurate check. Photo finishes make it less likely that officials will declare a race a dead heat. Finish line photos are still used in nearly every modern racing sport. Although some sports use electronic equipment to track the racers during a race, a photo is considered the most important evidence in selecting the winner. They are especially important during close races, but they are also used to assign official times to each competitor during any race. Method of capture =Strip photography= Photo-finish cameras were developed during the 1940s and 1950s as a means of regulating the racing industry and to reduce cheating. Betting on races became increasingly popular during the middle decades of the twentieth century. Authorities were therefore concerned to improve the probity of racing which was widely regarded as corrupt. Typically photo-finish cameras use strip photography, in which a camera is aimed at the finish line from an elevated position in a tower. It captures only the sequence of events on that line in the vertical dimension. Every part of each racer's body is shown as it appeared the moment it crossed the line; anything stationary is represented as a horizontal streak. The horizontal position represents time, and time markings along the bottom of the photo can be used to find the exact crossing time of any racer. The high angle allows judges to see the position of every racer in relation to the others. In a conventional photograph, the image shows a variety of locations at a fixed moment in time; strip photography swaps the time and space dimensions, showing a variety of times at a fixed location. The final image often shows a solid white background, which is a continuous scan of the painted finish line. Racers may appear distorted based on the movement of their limbs and heads as they cross the line; limbs are elongated where they remain static or move backwards in relation to the slit-shutter, or truncated if they move faster than the film moving past the slit. Film Single-exposure photo-finish images were made by a camera that was positioned at the finish line and initially applied to horse racing. The camera‚Äôs shutter which captured 136 images each second was triggered as a horse broke a thin thread on the race track. All too often, the single-exposure photo-finish camera failed to capture the decisive, first-place finish-line moment. These cameras only were used for first-place finishes, and provided no help in determining any of the other race placings.Robert Harron, ‚ÄúEye in the Sky,‚Äù Collier‚Äôs Illustrated Weekly, 19 September 1936, p. 60. The oldest single-exposure race-track photo- finish images discovered so far were made by John Charles Hemment in 1890.Gail Buckland, First Photographs: People, Places and Phenomena as Captured for the First Time by the Camera (New York: MacMillan Publishing Co., 1980), p. 126. Historically, in the United States motion picture cameras had been used since the 1920s for recording race-meets but were unsuitable for photo-finish photography as the frame rate was too infrequent to catch the critical instant horses or dogs reached the finish line. This record was achieved by using a special slit camera. Lorenzo Del Riccio, a Paramount Pictures motion picture engineer improved the circular flow camera, a device which had been invented in the 1930s especially for the purpose of photographing moving objects. The first racing club to make use of Del Riccio's 'Photo-Chart' camera for photo- finishes was the Del Mar Turf Club in California at its inaugural meeting in 1937. Unlike conventional cameras the circular flow camera used a single vertical slit instead of a shutter; a strip of film moved horizontally across the fine vertical opening located in the focal plane. This limited the field of vision to no more than a few inches, the restricted field being aligned with the vertical line on the winning post on which the lens was focused. The strip film moved across the slit in the opposite direction to the race and at substantially the same speed as the rate of movement of the image of the horses as each passed the finishing line. This kept the image of the horses more or less stationary with respect to the film. As soon as the first horse started to pass over the line, the camera began to record its image on the moving film from the nose backwards, progressively along the length of the body, with the arrival of every horse at the finishing post in succession. This produced a strip photographic record of the horses as they passed the vertical plane (winning post). Film was advanced continuously at a pace equivalent to the average speed of a racing horse, resulting in distortions of length (slower-moving horses appear to be stretched), but still preserving the order of finishers. Improvements were developed, including that made in 1948 by Australian Bertram Pearl whose system incorporated a mirror and neon-pulse time signature in the winning-post which would provide a precisely aligned image in which both sides of the horses could be viewed, and on which the neon left a set of stripes at 100th/sec intervals for accurate timing. If the reflected image of the horses aligned vertically exactly with the foreground image, it was proof that the camera was not viewing the finish line at an angle (and therefore incorrectly recording the horses' relative positions). Pearl's partner was his friend, society portraitist Athol Shmith. Shmith's contribution was to formulate means to speed the processing of the strip of negative down to 55 seconds and then to a rapid 35 seconds. These times rivalled even the instant one-minute picture processing by Edwin Land's Model 95 Polaroid camera which became available at that time. Digital Digital cameras use a 1-dimensional array sensor to take 1-pixel-wide sequential images of the finish line. Since only a single line of the CCD is read out at a time, the frame rates can be very high (up to 20,000 frames per second). Unlike a film based photo finish, there is no delay from developing the film, and the photo finish is available immediately. They may be triggered by a laser, photovoltaic means, or even motion sensing done within the photo finish camera. =Video= Another method for creating this strip involves combining individual photographs. A high-speed camera or a movie camera is used to take a continuous series of partial frame photos at a fast rate, while leaving no blank space between the cells. Uses =Athletics= 1987 400 metre hurdles: Sabine Busch 53.24s, Cornelia Ullrich 53.55s In athletics, races have to be timed accurately to hundredths (or even thousandths) of a second. A battery of electronic devices are installed in high-profile events (such as the Olympic Games) to ensure that accurate timings are given swiftly both to the spectators and to the officials. The photo finish has been used in the Olympics since as early as 1912, when the Stockholm Olympics used a camera system in the men's 1500 metres race.(In Swedish) Article in technical magazine Ny Teknik. Also with a picture of the finish line at the stadium The 1948 Olympics saw the finish of the men's 100 meter race determined with the use of photo finish equipment provided by Swiss watchmaker Omega and the British Race Finish Recording Company.https://secondtime.com/blog/omega-the- olympics-and-the-innovations-required-to-time-the-earths-best/ At the finish line, photocells and digital cameras are used to establish the placings. Sometimes, in a race as fast as the 100 m sprint, all eight athletes can be separated by less than half a second. It is not uncommon for two athletes to have exactly the same time recorded without there being a dead heat. The 2008 Summer Olympics saw the introduction of some of the fastest timekeeping equipment yet, with cameras that take photographs 3,000 times a second (compared to 1996, which were 1,000 times per second).Olympic Timekeeping More Accurate Than Ever Discovery Channel News . Retrieved 22 August 2008. =Triathlon= The 2012 Summer Olympics had a photo finish during a triathlon event in which Nicola Spirig of Switzerland and Lisa Nord√©n of Sweden finished the race at nearly the same time, but with Spirig ranked first. The Swedish Olympic Committee appealed the ranking. They claimed that the athletes should be ranked as joint winners because it was not clear that Spirig was ahead of Nord√©n. The camera on the far side of the track may have given additional evidence, but it was malfunctioning. The appeal was rejected and Spirig was declared the winner. This is the first time an Olympic triathlon result was decided on a photo finish.Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) Decision. Retrieved 13 August 2012. =Cycling= After a close sprint final in the Men's under-23 road race at the 2010 UCI Road World Championships in Melbourne, the organisers had to declare a dead heat between the two riders finishing just behind race winner Michael Matthews and runner-up John Degenkolb, as they were unable to detect any differences on the images taken from Tissot‚Äôs photo finish camera. Therefore the riders Taylor Phinney and Guillaume Boivin were both awarded a bronze medal. In the 2017 Tour de France a difference of 0.0003 seconds was judged by photo finish to separate the winner Marcel Kittel from Edvald Boasson Hagen, second, in the seventh stage of the race on July 7.La photo-finish ultra serr√©e entre Marcel Kittel et Edvald Boasson-Hagen, L'Equipe, July 7, 2017. (In French)Tom Cary, John MacLeary, Tour de France 2017, stage seven: Marcel Kittel beats Edvald Boasson Hagen in photo-finish as Chris Froome retains lead, The Daily Telegraph, July 7, 2017. =Motor racing= A photo finish is possible in NASCAR. On February 17, 2018, Tyler Reddick beat Elliott Sadler by .0004 seconds to win the PowerShares QQQ 300 race in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. It is the closest finish in NASCAR history. A photo finish has occurred in the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series four times: * On July 15, 1995, Butch Miller beat Mike Skinner by .001 seconds to win the Total Petroleum 200. * On June 14, 2008, Erik Darnell beat Johnny Benson by .005 seconds to win the Cool City Customs 200. * On October 30, 2010, Kyle Busch beat Aric Almirola by .002 seconds to win the Mountain Dew 250, the second closest winning margin in history. * On May 15, 2015, Kasey Kahne beat Erik Jones by .005 seconds to win the North Carolina Education Lottery 200. Two races have tied for closest margin for a photo finish in the Cup Series: * The 2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 at Darlington Raceway, where Ricky Craven won over Kurt Busch by 0.002 seconds. * The 2011 Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway, where drafting help from Dale Earnhardt Jr. allowed Jimmie Johnson to win the race by 0.002 seconds over Clint Bowyer. * Although not officially in a points race, in 2001, Mike Skinner won a Gatorade Duel at Daytona by inches over Dale Earnhardt Jr. =Horse racing= A dead heat In horse racing, photo finishes determine accurately when the horses hit the finish line. This developed in the late 1930s, by the end of which strip cameras were used for photo finishes; prior to this point high-speed motion picture cameras were used, but did not provide sufficient temporal resolution.\\"Strip Tease: An introduction to the strip camera, how Tom Dahlin made his, and how you can too.\\", Tom Dahlin, SportsShooter, 2008-08-18 Stewards at the racetrack usually put up PHOTO status on the races during these photo finishes; the status of objection or inquiry can also trigger if other horses or jockeys somehow interfered in the horse rankings and can factor in dead heats. The most notable dead heat was in the 1989 Hambletonian Stakes, with both Park Avenue Joe and Probe finishing in a dead heat. A photo finish decided the winner of the 2005 running of the Japan Cup, which was given to Alkaseed, narrowly defeating Heart's Cry. And in 2011 with new digital technology recording vision at 10,000 frames per second, Dunaden was declared a winner over Red Cadeaux in the $6 million Melbourne Cup.

Built in 1937 by Philips of Eindhoven it is now in the National Science Museum in London, England. The Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton (CW) generator, or multiplier, is an electric circuit that generates a high DC voltage from a low-voltage AC or pulsing DC input. It was named after the British and Irish physicists John Douglas Cockcroft and Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton, who in 1932 used this circuit design to power their particle accelerator, performing the first artificial nuclear disintegration in history. They used this voltage multiplier cascade for most of their research, which in 1951 won them the Nobel Prize in Physics for \\"Transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles\\". The circuit was discovered in 1919, by Heinrich Greinacher, a Swiss physicist. For this reason, this doubler cascade is sometimes also referred to as the Greinacher multiplier. Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton circuits are still used in particle accelerators. They also are used in everyday electronic devices that require high voltages, such as X-ray machines, cathode ray tube television sets, microwave ovens and photocopiers. Operation A two-stage Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton multiplier A three-stage full-wave CW multiplier The CW generator is a voltage multiplier that converts AC or pulsing DC electrical power from a low voltage level to a higher DC voltage level. It is made up of a voltage multiplier ladder network of capacitors and diodes to generate high voltages. Unlike transformers, this method eliminates the requirement for the heavy core and the bulk of insulation/potting required. Using only capacitors and diodes, these voltage multipliers can step up relatively low voltages to extremely high values, while at the same time being far lighter and cheaper than transformers. The biggest advantage of such circuits is that the voltage across each stage of the cascade is equal to only twice the peak input voltage in a half-wave rectifier. In a full-wave rectifier it is three times the input voltage. It has the advantage of requiring relatively low-cost components and being easy to insulate. One can also tap the output from any stage, like in a multitapped transformer. To understand the circuit operation, see the diagram of the two-stage version at right. Assume the circuit is powered by an alternating voltage Vi with a peak value of Vp, and initially the capacitors are uncharged. After the input voltage is turned on *When the input voltage Vi reaches its negative peak ‚àíVp, current flows through diode D1 to charge capacitor C1 to a voltage of Vp. *When Vi reverses polarity and reaches its positive peak +Vp, it adds to the capacitor's voltage to produce a voltage of 2Vp on C1s righthand plate. Since D1 is reverse-biased, current flows from C1 through diode D2, charging capacitor C2 to a voltage of 2Vp. *When Vi reverses polarity again, current from C2 flows through diode D3, charging capacitor C3 also to a voltage of 2Vp. *When Vi reverses polarity again, current from C3 flows through diode D4, charging capacitor C4 also to a voltage of 2Vp. With each change in input polarity, current flows up the \\"stack\\" of capacitors through the diodes, until they are all charged. All the capacitors are charged to a voltage of 2Vp, except for C1, which is charged to Vp. The key to the voltage multiplication is that while the capacitors are charged in parallel, they are connected to the load in series. Since C2 and C4 are in series between the output and ground, the total output voltage (under no-load conditions) is Vo = 4Vp. This circuit can be extended to any number of stages. The no-load output voltage is twice the peak input voltage multiplied by the number of stages N or equivalently the peak-to-peak input voltage swing (Vpp) times the number of stages :V_o = 2NV_p = NV_\\\\text{pp}, The number of stages is equal to the number of capacitors in series between the output and ground. One way to look at the circuit is that it functions as a charge \\"pump\\", pumping electric charge in one direction, up the stack of capacitors. The CW circuit, along with other similar capacitor circuits, is often called charge pump. For substantial loads, the charge on the capacitors is partially depleted, and the output voltage drops according to the output current divided by the capacitance. Characteristics In practice, the CW has a number of drawbacks. As the number of stages is increased, the voltages of the higher stages begin to \\"sag\\", primarily due to the electrical impedance of the capacitors in the lower stages. And, when supplying an output current, the voltage ripple rapidly increases as the number of stages is increased (this can be corrected with an output filter, but it requires a stack of capacitors in order to withstand the high voltages involved). For these reasons, CW multipliers with large number of stages are used only where relatively low output current is required. The sag can be reduced by increasing the capacitance in the lower stages, and the ripple can be reduced by increasing the frequency of the input and by using a square waveform. By driving the CW from a high-frequency source, such as an inverter, or a combination of an inverter and HV transformer, the overall physical size and weight of the CW power supply can be substantially reduced. CW multipliers are typically used to develop higher voltages for relatively low-current applications, such as bias voltages ranging from tens or hundreds of volts to millions of volts for high-energy physics experiments or lightning safety testing. CW multipliers are also found, with a higher number of stages, in laser systems, high-voltage power supplies, X-ray systems, LCD backlighting, traveling-wave tube amplifiers, ion pumps, electrostatic systems, air ionisers, particle accelerators, copy machines, scientific instrumentation, oscilloscopes, television sets and cathode ray tubes, electroshock weapons, bug zappers and many other applications that use high-voltage DC.  Image gallery  See also A similar circuit is the Marx generator, which has a similar \\"ladder\\" structure, but consists of resistors, capacitors and spark gaps. The Marx generator produces short pulses, whereas the CW generator produces a constant DC. Unlike the Cockcroft-Walton multiplier (generator), the Marx generator needs air for the spark gaps and can not be immersed in oil as an insulator. Notes Further reading *J. D. Cockcroft and E. T. S.

The architecture This subsystem is a part of .NET Framework 3.0 WCF is a tool often used to implement and deploy a service-oriented architecture (SOA). It is designed using service-oriented architecture principles to support distributed computing where services have remote consumers. Clients can consume multiple services; services can be consumed by multiple clients. Services are loosely coupled to each other. Services typically have a WSDL interface (Web Services Description Language) that any WCF client can use to consume the service, regardless of which platform the service is hosted on. WCF implements many advanced Web services (WS) standards such as WS-Addressing, WS- ReliableMessaging and WS-Security. With the release of .NET Framework 4.0, WCF also provides RSS Syndication Services, WS-Discovery, routing and better support for REST services. =Endpoints= A WCF client connects to a WCF service via an endpoint. Each service exposes its contract via one or more endpoints. An endpoint has an address (which is a URL specifying where the endpoint can be accessed) and binding properties that specify how the data will be transferred. The mnemonic \\"ABC\\" can be used to remember address/binding/contract. Binding specifies what communication protocols are used to access the service, whether security mechanisms are to be used, and the like. WCF includes predefined bindings for most common communication protocols such as SOAP over HTTP, SOAP over TCP, and SOAP over Message Queues, etc. Interaction between WCF endpoint and client is done using a SOAP envelope. SOAP envelopes are in simple XML form, which makes WCF platform- independent. When a client wants to access the service via an endpoint, it not only needs to know the contract, but it also has to adhere to the binding specified by the endpoint. Thus, both client and server must have compatible endpoints. With the release of the .NET Framework 3.5 in November 2007, Microsoft released an encoder that added support for the JSON serialization format to WCF. =Behaviors= Behaviors are types that modify or extend service or client functionality. Behaviors allow the developer to create custom processing, transformation, or inspection that is applied to messages as they are sent or received. Some examples of uses for behaviors are: * Controlling whether metadata is published with a service. * Adding security features to a service, such as impersonation, authorization, or managing tokens * Recording information about messages, such as tracking, tracing, or logging * Message or parameter validation * Invoking all additional operations when messages are received‚Äîsuch as notifying users when certain messages arrive Behaviors implement the \`IServiceBehavior\` interface for service extensions, the \`IEndpointBehavior\` for endpoints, the \`IContractBehavior\` interface for service contracts, or the \`IOperationBehavior\` for operations. Service behaviors are used for message processing across a service, rather than processing that would be specific to a single operation. Interoperability WCF supports interoperability with WCF applications running on the same Windows machine or WCF running on a different Windows machines or standard Web services built on platforms such as Java running on Windows or other operating systems. In addition to SOAP, WCF 4 supports non- SOAP XML, RSS, JSON, and binary formats for external communication via HTTP or HTTPS. See also *Microsoft Connected Services Framework *Web Services Enhancements *Service Component Architecture (SCA) and Service Data Objects (SDO), which are alternatives to WCF in the Java world standardized by OASIS.

It is one of the largest franchised optical retailers in North America. The company was acquired by Luxottica, an Italian eye wear company, in 2004. As of December 31, 2018, Pearle Vision operated 110 corporate stores and had 419 franchises throughout North America.  History  It was founded in 1961 by Stanley Pearle, an optometrist in Savannah, Georgia, United States. In 1971, Pearle purchased a 17-store optical chain owned by Robert Hillman and Larry Kohan; together, Hillman and Kohan stayed on and helped to expand Pearle Vision nationwide.In the 1970's the chain was owned by GD Searle Pharmaceutical, not Stanley Pearle who was a founding father and board member. Stanley Pearle sold his stores to the United Kingdom conglomerate Grand Metropolitan in 1985. Grand Met expanded Pearle Vision to more than 1,000 locations worldwide by 1990, but profits became elusive. In 1996, Grand Met sold the Pearle stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico to Cole National Corporation, which operated optical departments inside such retail stores as Sears, BJ's Wholesale Club and Target. In 1997 Cole National bought the 150-store NuVision chain in Michigan and converted them to the Pearle Vision name. The Belgian stores were sold to GIB in Belgium and the Dutch stores to HAL Investments in the Netherlands. HAL Investments bought the Belgian stores 1 year later from GIB and merged both chains into Pearle Benelux. right Luxottica, owner of LensCrafters, purchased Cole National in 2004, a deal that brought together the two largest eyewear retailers in the United States. The Pearle chain of opticians in Europe is now part of Grandvision and has more than 1000 branches in 43 countries including the Netherlands (pearle.nl), Belgium, Germany (Apollo-Optik), Austria (pearle.at), Poland, Portugal, Italy, Finland and Estonia. For more than 40 years the company has been selling branded products and products under its own brand name. The first Pearle Optical store in the Middle East opened in Marina Mall, Kuwait, on January 15, 2003, and currently operates 18 stores in the Middle East: 4 in Kuwait, 10 in KSA, 3 in UAE, 5 in Egypt and 1 in Qatar. Pearle Vision store, Revere Massachusetts Notably, Pearle Vision has repeatedly experienced difficulty operating successfully in California. Its traditional business model directly conflicts with California's strong consumer protection statutes which are designed to prevent the obvious conflict of interest that arises when an optometrist and an optician practice side-by-side in the same business (one can prescribe more eyewear to be made by the other, thus inflating the overall profits of the business). On June 12, 2006, the Supreme Court of California ruled that Pearle Vision could not escape the reach of those statutes, and Pearle Vision's attempts to find a loophole through the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 were unavailing.People v. Cole, 38 Cal. 4th 964 (2006). Stanley Pearle died on July 21, 2011. He is survived by three children, 10 grandchildren and 11 great‚Äêgrandchildren.

He was a leading figure in the Conservative Monday Club. Early years The son of Major John Norman Biggs-Davison, Royal Garrison Artillery, (d. 1972), of Somerset, and his wife Sarah (n√©e Wright), John Alec Biggs-Davison was born at Boscombe, Bournemouth, raised a Roman Catholic, and educated at Clifton CollegeClifton College Register, J.

Commissioned into the Royal Marines in 1939,Dod's Parliamentary Companion, 1983, ed. Charles Roger Dod, Robert Phipps Dod, p. 352 From 1942 he worked for the Indian Civil Service and the Pakistan Administrative Service, where he was an assistant commissioner in the Punjab before being deputed to Bengal.The India Office and Burma Office List 1945, fifty-fifth edition, London: His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1945, p. 141 He was the Conservative candidate for Coventry South in the 1951 general election. He became a Conservative Party Member of Parliament in 1955 but resigned the Conservative Whip and sat as an Independent 1957‚Äì58 in opposition to the government's withdrawal from Suez following direct pressure from the US and Soviet governments. He subsequently resumed the Conservative Whip. Despite wariness of the United States, he supported the setting up of an American-style broadcasting system in the UK; shortly before the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act became law in 1967, he was heard on the offshore station Radio 270 stating that \\"a voice of freedom will have been silenced when Radio 270 goes off the air\\" (ref. The Times, 11 August 1967). When some Labour Party members called for his old friend Enoch Powell to be prosecuted under the Race Relations Act (see Letter- to-the-Editor, Daily Telegraph 22 November 1968), John Biggs-Davison leapt to Powell's defence in an acrimonious House of Commons debate during which Harold Wilson was accused of being an enemy of free speech. In late January 1975, he gave a warning that the Azores could become a Soviet naval base instead of American because of the revolution in Portugal. That year, during a House of Commons debate on the Trades Union Congress invitation to Alexander Shelepin, the former Soviet KGB Chief, to visit Britain, Biggs-Davison compared him to Heinrich Himmler. He was the Conservative Party's Opposition Shadow Cabinet Spokesman for Northern Ireland, 1976‚Äì78, and was also Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party's Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Committee, and a member of the 1922 Committee Executive. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1981. The Primrose League Gazette carried an obituary in the form of a tribute to Biggs- Davison in their November/December 1988 edition. Monday Club Biggs-Davison was an active member of the Conservative Monday Club from 1962 until his death. He spoke on their behalf on many occasions both inside and out of the House of Commons, and wrote numerous papers for the Club, and forewords to others. He was one of the principal speakers at Duncan Sandys' \\"Peace with Rhodesia\\" rally in Trafalgar Square in January 1967, which was broadcast. The Club held a 'Law and Liberty' May Day Rally in 1970, again in Trafalgar Square, at which Biggs-Davison was a main speaker. He likened the suspension and subsequent abolition of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to \\"someone sawing away the branch he bestraddles\\". He was re-elected a member of the Club's Executive Council on 5 June 1972. In July 1972, he called for tough action in Northern Ireland to clean up the 'No-Go' areas, and was one of the main speakers at the Club's \\"Halt Immigration Now!\\" meeting in Westminster Central Hall in September 1972, at the end of which a resolution was passed calling on the government to halt all immigration, repeal the 1968 Race Relations Act, and start a full repatriation scheme. This was delivered to the Prime Minister, Edward Heath, who stated that the government had no intention of repealing the Act. In the House of Commons in March 1973, Sir Alec Douglas- Home rejected a suggestion from John Biggs-Davison that Britain should deduct aid funds from Zambia and Tanzania sufficient to compensate victims in Rhodesia of armed attacks mounted from those countries. In October that year, he called for the Provisional Irish Republican Army to be also proscribed in the island of Great Britain, as it already was in the whole of Ireland. At the end of 1973, Biggs-Davison's book, The Hand is Red was published, which traces the history of Ireland, notably in the 20th century. He claimed that the Provisional IRA was infiltrated by Communists and Trotskyists, and part of an international subversion and terrorist network. In January 1974, Biggs-Davison asked Edward Heath if the Monday Club's latest policy document would be given proper consideration by the party, to which Heath replied that \\"due consideration would be given to it\\". In April 1974, John Biggs-Davison attacked the amnesty for illegal immigrants, supported by Harold Soref who said it was \\"making retrospectively what was a crime a legal act\\". In May 1974, Biggs-Davison was re-elected unopposed as Chairman of the Monday Club. That month, Robert Taylor, Patrick Wall and John Biggs-Davison tabled a motion in the House of Commons deploring the Labour government's decision to cancel the visit to Cape Town by the Royal Yacht Britannia. He subsequently spoke at Essex University, but had to have police protection, while a mob outside demonstrated singing The Red Flag. In June, he raised the matter of the IRA's London march with the Home Secretary and asked why it had not been banned under the Public Order Act. When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's book, \\"The Gulag Archipelago\\", was banned from United Nations bookstalls in Geneva, on the grounds that it was offensive to a member nation, John Biggs-Davison asked James Callaghan, then Foreign Secretary, if he was satisfied that nothing offensive to the United Kingdom was sold at UN headquarters. Following the Conservative Party's defeat in the February 1974 general election, Biggs- Davison, writing in the Daily Telegraph said \\"to win back the voters, to revive Tory democracy among the industrial workers, our appeal must be practical and patriotic, not 'progressive' and 'permissive'\\". In November 1974, he was elected Chairman of the Conservative Parliamentary Northern Ireland Committee, the Daily Telegraph's headline being \\"Hardliner Heads Tory Team\\". Biggs-Davison attacked the ITV interview with IRA leader D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill the same month. Winding up the House of Commons debate on Northern Ireland in December, he said \\"I do not believe the people of Northern Ireland want independence; still less do they want some sort of federation with the republic\\". In a letter to the press in January 1975, he referred to sectarian murders in Ulster and said that \\"the conflict is not now between two religions or cultures, but between society and its enemies\\". He called for reciprocity over extradition with the Republic. During a further debate in March, on immigration from the Indian sub-continent, he told Home Office Minister Alexander Lyon that \\"your attitude feeds the fears of people in Britain, and this was very bad for harmony between the races\\". He was one of a number of prominent speakers at the Monday Club two-day Conference in Birmingham in March 1975, the title of which was The Conservative Party and the Crisis in Britain. He was elected National Club Chairman the following May, for a two- year term.

There is separate legislation for Scotland that requires anyone selling a property to provide a Home Report.http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built- Environment/Housing/BuyingSelling/Home-Report/prof/legislation The pack was a set of documents about the property: an Energy Performance Certificate, local authority searches, title documents, guarantees, etc. The introduction of HIPs was subject to delays and reduced requirements, but they became mandatory for homes with four or more bedrooms on 1 August 2007 and were extended to three- bedroomed properties from 10 September 2007. The Government had suggested that Home Information Packs would lead to a reduction in the number of abortive sales as their justification for introducing the scheme, reducing gazumping and gazundering. They were introduced despite very strong opposition from some factions in the building industry (although very many were in favour of them) and estate agents, as well as some chartered surveyors. There were claims that the packs contributed to the 2007-09 housing crisis by deterring vendors from marketing their houses due to the extra costs involved in the survey. Requirement for the Home Information Pack for property sales was suspended with effect from 21 May 2010 by the incoming government.Directgov - Home Information Packs An exception is that the Energy Performance Certificate is still required. The Localism Act 2011 formally repealed the Home Information Pack legislation on 15 January 2012.UK Legislation - Localism Act 2011  History  As the idea of the Home Information Pack developed over time, so did the reasons for its introduction. A proposal to address the problem of gazumping was first made in the 1997 Labour Party manifesto. Research after the election revealed that around 28% of sales fell before exchange of contracts, with gazumping occurring in less than 2% of sales. The emphasis subsequently moved to the benefits of increased speed, transparency and consumer friendliness. The idea was based on similar practice used in Denmark. Home Information Packs were announced in the Queen's Speech in November 2003. In March 2006 the government gave the go-ahead for multiple certification schemes. By this stage a number of organisations had expressed an interest in running certification schemes and over 3,000 people were already going through training for the home inspector qualification. In June 2006 draft regulations were made setting out the detailed contents of Home Information Packs, rules governing the availability of packs, exceptions from the pack duties and arrangements for enforcement. In September 2006 the government approved the first Certification Schemes to oversee the work of Home Inspectors. The schemes were set up and run by industry; Government set the standards that the schemes operated. In September the Home Condition Report Register contract was agreed. A fully operational register was scheduled to follow as soon as possible afterwards. In June 2007 the government announced they would fund or subsidise 5000 HIPs by ¬£100 prior to the official launch date of 1 August 2007. Originally the HIP was going to be required from 1 June 2007. However, just ten days before that date, Communities Secretary Ruth Kelly announced that they would be phased in from August 2007, and initially only for larger properties. Between 1 August and 10 September only homes marketed with four or more bedrooms were legally required to have an HIP. This was extended to cover homes with three or more bedrooms from 10 September. On 22 November 2007 Housing Minister Yvette Cooper announced that HIPs would be rolled out to include one and two bedroom properties as of 14 December completing the Government's phased introduction of Home Information Packs to residential homes marketed for sale within England and Wales. First Day Marketing (FDM) is the mandatory requirement to make available all of the documents required within a HIP on the first day a home is marketed to the public. Initially, the date was set for the requirement to commence on 31 December 2007 but was delayed until 1 June 2008 to allow a period of transition. A home was able to be marketed during that time providing a commitment to pay for a HIP - including the EPC - was made and the necessary documents had a reasonable expectation of being made available within 28 days. However, on 8 May 2008 the Housing Minister, announced a further delay to first day marketing until 31 December 2008. Since 6 April 2009, every property required a Home Information Pack before it could be marketed. The full HIP is now no longer required, only the Energy Performance Certificate.  Contents  The pack had to contain the following, and should be no more than three months old when the property is first marketed: * Index * Energy Performance Certificate * Sale Statement * Property Information Questionnaire * Title documents for the property * Local Authority and drainage searches If the property was leasehold or commonhold, then the pack also had to include the following: * Copy of the lease * Building insurance policy * Contact details for the landlord or management and any legal details * Regulations that apply * Recent service charge receipts and accounts For a transitional period sellers were able to market their homes without the searches or leasehold documents as long as the pack contained evidence that they had been commissioned and would be included as soon as practicable but certainly within 28 days. However the Government announced in December 2008 that with effect from 6 April 2009 this concession was to be withdrawn, and the HIPS pack would have to be completely available on the day that the property was first offered for sale. The pack could also contain some or all of these authorised documents: * Home Condition Report * Two sellers questionnaire forms called Home Use Form and Home Contents Form * Legal summary * Other searches such as a mining search = Home Condition Report = A property inspector primary task is to inspect a property to ensure that there are no structural flaws in the property. The inspector‚Äôs task needs to be only on the surface level and he cannot make an intrusive check on the property. That is unless the inspector or his team find something that is just too extraordinary to ignore. A home inspection is done using a large number of tools and special equipment to conduct the analysis. The main agenda of the inspection is to check for vulnerable areas in the home that could be a hazard risk. Does the home have any structural flaws? Is the property built with sub- standard materials? These are the kind of questions that need to be answered by the home inspector. 14 Home energy performance rating charts = Energy Performance Certificate = Similar to EU appliance efficiency ratings, the energy performance ratings on the Energy Performance Certificate provide prospective purchasers with an assessment of the property's energy consumption, together with a list of practical measures that can be taken to cut their fuel bills and carbon emissions. An Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) in the UK needs to be completed by a government qualified Domestic Energy Assessor (DEA). DEAs offer advice on how to improve the energy performance of the dwelling which might save money. However, in practice, such documents only give general advice of little value to potential purchasers. They frequently exhibit errors since the survey is superficial and non- intrusive. They neglect older and listed buildings where planning consent is needed for structural changes to the property, such as installing double glazed windows for example. The Energy Saving Trust hoped that by following the proposals in the energy performance certificate, the average home owner might save ¬£300 a year on fuel bills. Government also hoped that the information could be used to support the growth of green mortgages and other incentives. This part of the Home Information Pack was required in order to meet the requirements of the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. However, the EPC has met with fierce opposition by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, which in May 2007 began court action against the Government to force a Judicial Review of the implementation, demanding it look again at the lifespan of an EPC in a HIP. The move prompted internal protest within RICS after a number of members petitioned the organisation to withdraw its legal action on the basis it had failed to consult members first.  Cost  Initially the cost of a Home Information Pack, including the Home Condition Report, was estimated to be around ¬£600 by the Government. This was to include the cost of the postponed Home Condition Report, which was expected by the Department for Communities and Local Government to cost between ¬£250 and ¬£1000. Industry subsequently expected the Home Information Pack (excluding the HCR) to cost between ¬£300 - ¬£600 for the vast majority of properties in England and Wales. Naturally, for larger or more complex properties, the costs could be significantly higher. Some estate agents were offering HIPs for free. The Government pointed out, however, that most of the items in the pack already have to be provided during the sale process, so this is not all an additional cost.  Enforcement  Failure to provide a Home Information Pack, or supplying an incomplete pack carried a fine of ¬£200 per day the property is marketed. Enforcement was to be carried out by local authority Trading Standards Departments; however they claimed that this was inappropriate as they normally regulate businesses, and that it would cost them too much to enforce through the civil courts. On 31 July 2007 the Office of Fair Trading advised estate agents on their obligations. From 1 August 2007 failure by an estate agents in England and Wales to comply with the new Home Information Packs regulations could result in a ban from estate agency work.  Reception  On 15 May 2007 the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) started Judicial Review proceedings against the Department for Communities and Local Government for what they regarded as the department's failure to carry out a full consultation on HIPs. Despite the above objections to the HIPs scheme, RICS were already providing courses on Home Inspection and Domestic Energy Assessment, as well as courseware manuals for the professions of Home Inspector & Domestic Energy Assessor. There were fears that the up-front cost involved may put off some people from putting their house on the market, which may in turn depress the housing market. The property industry has been largely against these changes. but the government said the new system would leave all homeowners better off. The National Association of Estate Agents held the view that the legislation was unnecessary, did not cover the important reasons why home sales and purchase transactions fall through, and that the cost was too high. Britain's largest independent estate agency, Spicerhaart, initially called for a boycott of the home information packs scheme, although then revised this position to one of full support. In contrast, the introduction of HIPs was originally supported by Which?, who believe that they could reduce the number of failed transactions resulting from problems that can be identified at an early stage. The organisation has since withdrawn its support following the Government's decision to postpone the introduction of Home Condition Reports. The Conservative Party, when in Opposition, stated that they planned to scrap the legislation, calling it 'expensive and deficient red tape'. Indeed, Conservative opposition to HIPs was instrumental in a defeat in the House of Lords, where peers voted by 186 to 160 in favour of abandoning the packs. This brought them in conflict with the Association of Home Information Pack Providers. Under Part 3 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, a person who is responsible for marketing a house must provide a Home Report to any prospective purchasers. To do this you will need to commission a Chartered Surveyor (or approved provider) to carry out the Single Survey and Energy Report. You must also complete a Property Questionnaire. On 12 May 2010 the incoming Conservative ‚Äì Liberal Democrat coalition government announced an intention to scrap Home Information Packs. The requirement for property sellers to provide HIPs was suspended on 20 May.

They kill the men and divide the women and treasures among themselves, then begin to feast, despite Odysseus' advice that they leave immediately. The Cicones, who have left in search of help, come back in the morning in great numbers. Odysseus manages to escape, although he loses several men in the process. He embarks with the survivors and continues his journey home to Ithaca. While at Ismaros, Odysseus spares Maron, the son of Euanthes and the priest of Apollo, and his family. Because of this, Maron gifts him a \\"goatskin bottle of black wine\\", some gold, and a mixing bowl. The wine was a strong and divine drink, as for each cup of wine, 20 times as much water was added to it to dilute it. He uses this wine to lull the Cyclops Polyphemus to sleep.

Issues When using SVISTA instances in an environment where MAC addresses are used as unique identifiers (UID), it is advisable to manually configure the MAC address for each virtual machine to ensure each is actually unique. One example of such an environment is one in which MAC security is enabled on switches and another example is an environment in which Altiris products are used (if configured to use the MAC address as the UID). If you are in such a situation, simply disable all networks/adapters other than bridged and edit each virtual machine's configuration (.2os) file and change the 'MAC address' to be unique.

Also called folk song or urban folk music (Gr: Œ±œÉœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒªŒ±œäŒ∫ŒÆ ŒºŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ∫ŒÆ or ŒªŒ±œäŒ∫Œ¨ œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥ŒπŒ± la√Øk√° tragoudia), in its plural form is a Greek music genre which has taken many forms over the years. La√Øk√≥ followed after the commercialization of Rebetiko music. It is strongly dominated by Greek folk music and it is used to describe Greek popular music as a whole. When used in context, it refers mostly to the form it took in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s. Rebetiko and Elafr√≥ tragoudi Until the 1930s the Greek discography was dominated by two musical genres: the Greek folk music (Demotik√°) and the Elafr√≥ tragoudi (literally: \\"light[weight] song\\"). The latter was represented by ensembles of singers/musicians or solo artists like Attik and Nikos Gounaris. It was the Greek version of the international popular music of the era. In the 1930s the first rebetiko recordings had a massive impact on Greek music. As Markos Vamvakaris stated \\"we were the first to record la√Øk√° (popular) songs\\". In the years to follow this type of music, the first form of what is now called la√Øk√≥ tragoudi, became the mainstream Greek music. Classic la√Øk√≥ Marinella. Classic la√Øk√≥ as it is known today, was the mainstream popular music of Greece during the 1960s and 1970s. Laiko music evolved from the traditional Greek music of the ancient and the medieval Greek era and was established until the present day.\\"Greek Traditional Music\\": ŒôŒΩœÉœÑŒπœÑŒøœçœÑŒø Œ≠œÅŒµœÖŒΩŒ±œÇ ŒºŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÖœÉœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ - Institute for research on music and acoustics.Samuel Baud-Bovy, ŒîŒøŒ∫ŒØŒºŒπŒø Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒø ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøœÑŒπŒ∫œå Œ§œÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥Œπ, 3rd edition, Œ†ŒµŒªŒøœÄŒøŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÉŒπŒ±Œ∫œå ŒõŒ±ŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒπŒ∫œå ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖŒºŒ±, ŒùŒ±œçœÄŒªŒπŒø: 1966, pp. 1‚Äì13.

La√Øk√≥ was dominated by singers such as Nikos Xanthopoulos and composers such as Mimis Plessas. Among the most significant songwriters and lyricists of this period are George Zambetas and the big names of the Rebetiko era that were still in business, like Vassilis Tsitsanis and Manolis Chiotis. Many artists combined the traditions of √©ntekhno and la√Øk√≥ with considerable success, such as the composers Stavros Xarchakos and Mimis Plessas. Contemporary la√Øk√≥ Contemporary la√Øk√≥ (œÉœçŒ≥œáœÅŒøŒΩŒø ŒªŒ±œäŒ∫œå) (also called Modern la√Øk√≥ or la√Øko-pop) can be called in Greece the mainstream music genre, with variations in plural form as Contemporary la√Øk√°. Along with Modern la√Øk√° in Greek is currently Greece's mainstream music genre. The main cultural Greek dances and rhythms of today's Greek music culture la√Øk√° are Nisiotika, Syrta, Antikristos, Rebetika, Hasapiko, Zeibekiko, Kalamatianos, Kangeli and Syrtaki.

Many artists have combined the traditions of √©ntekhno and la√Øk√≥ with considerable success, such as the composers Mimis Plessas and Stavros Xarchakos. Contemporary la√Øk√° emerged as a style in the early 1980s. An indispensable part of the contemporary la√Øk√° culture is the p√≠sta (Greek: œÄŒØœÉœÑŒ±; pl.: œÄŒØœÉœÑŒµœÇ), \\"dance floor/venue\\".

It has at least two distinct meanings which often can only be determined from the fine grain context in which the term is used. (This could be complicated at times since in German publications, local languages of villages or cities are commonly referred to as \\"the dialects\\" or \\"dialect\\", whereas the regiolects, which are dialects of Low German or High German in a linguistic sense, are hardly called so, but referred to using terms like \\"Rhinelandic\\", \\"Hessian,\\" or \\"Bavarian\\", etc., that also name large compounds of related local languages ) One of the meanings of Rhinelandic is that of a group of local languages in an area called the Rhineland. Another meaning is that of the regiolect being used by the people approximately of the same area.  Rhinelandic Local Languages  Rhinelandic is used for a collection of local languages and their varieties in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, including some varieties of the Limburgish language group (of which Bergish is a subgroup), South Guelderish or Cleverlands (of which East Bergish is a subgroup), Moselle Franconian, and Ripuarian (which includes South Bergish as a subgroup, that is also referred to as East Ripuarian). Its northern areas are also covered by the more modern term of Meuse-Rhenish, which exclusively refers to the Low Franconian varieties, that are Limburgish including Bergish, and South Guelderish including East Bergish. The eastern areas in the North are also said to speak Bergish, a term which has its roots in political history and regional pride rather than linguistic similarities. Likewise, the Eifel inhabitants say, they were speaking Eifelplatt, while linguists rather refer to the Ripuarian varieties of the North, and the Moselle-Frankonian ones of the South of the Eifel. All these local languages and local language groups existed long before Standard German, and developed in parallel since the latter came into existence.  Rhinelandic Regiolect  Contrasting the collective term Rhinelandic, that encompasses a wide variety of largely mutually incomprehensible local languages having a long history, also the Regiolect of the Rhineland, geographically roughly coinciding with the former Prussian Rhine Province, is being called Rhinelandic. It is of comparatively recent origin, and derives from Standard German but takes some lexical and grammatical and phonetic features of the local languages up, that Standard German normally does not have. Most of those features are not used in other German regiolects, and are often hardly or not understood in other regiolect areas.

Gloggnitz is situated in the south-western part of the Vienna Basin in Lower Austria. It is surrounded by the highest mountains in Lower Austria, Mount Rax (2007m / 6585 ft) and Mount Schneeberg (2076m / 6811 ft). The town is also a major traffic junction: Gloggnitz is situated on the main S√ºdbahn (the important rail route between Vienna and Trieste in Italy) and the S6 motorway . Gloggnitz is famous for producing two of Austria's most distinguished Federal Presidents. Federal President Dr Michael Hainisch (1858 - 1940) and the Chancellor of State and later Federal President Dr Karl Renner (1870 - 1950) were both Gloggnitz citizens. Dr Karl Renner spent 42 years of his life in Gloggnitz (up until his death in 1950). On the occasion of the anniversary of his hundredth birthday a monument was erected in Dr Karl Renner Square. A museum in his former residence also commemorates the life of this highly respected former Gloggnitz resident. Sights and Monuments =Gloggnitz Provostry= Gloggnitz Provostry with the old Catholic parish church Gloggnitz Provostry is a former medieval (gothic) Catholic monastery and a later secularised (baroque) complex of buildings, including the old Catholic parish church of Gloggnitz. It was also the home of the nationally renowned exhibition, \\"Lower Austrian Landesausstellung 1992‚Äú. =Christ the King Church= This is the new Catholic parish church, designed by the world- famous Austrian architect Prof Clemens Holzmeister. It was completed in 1962. =St Othmar's Chapel= This is one of Gloggnitz's oldest buildings. The estimated date of construction lies between 1001 and 1102 A.D. This date is dependent upon different historical appraisals. It is situated in the town centre (Hauptplatz). =The Aue Herrenhaus= The Herrenhaus is a baroque manor-house and the birthplace of Dr. Michael Hainisch, the first Federal President of the First Republic of Austria. Unfortunately the building is now in ruins. =Stuppach Palace= Stuppach Palace is the place where possibly a primal chamber musical version of Mozart's Requiem was premiered by an ensemble, conducted by Count Francis of Walsegg-Stuppach, the sponsor of the now world-famous Requiem. The palace was restored in 1996. =The Renner Museum= This was the former residential mansion of Karl Renner, the first Federal President of the Second Republic of Austria. Economy and Industry There have been extensive changes in all branches of the Gloggnitz economy within the past 30 years. Within this period Gloggnitz developed from a local commercial centre and railway junction into an economically active town. Today Gloggnitz can be proud of several internationally-active companies, employing hundreds of people. History The place name \\"Gloggnitz\\" descends from the Slavic word \\"Klokati\\", which means \\"bubble\\" or \\"murmur\\", and was first mentioned in 1094. \\"Clocniza\\" or \\"Glocniza\\" means \\"Murmuring River\\". Monks from the Bavarian monastery of Formbach built a hermitage near the River Schwarza. This led to the establishment of a provostry for Gloggnitz. In the 15th century the monks and local inhabitants were active farmers, craftsmen and wine makers. Later climate changes made the conditions for wine making less favourable and as a consequence unprofitable. For over 900 years (until the 19th century) the economic and social life of Gloggnitz and its local area was highly influenced and controlled by the monasterial lords of the manor. The town's favourable position on the strategic arterial route from Lower Austria to Italy encouraged colonisation and the small village of Gloggnitz grew. Gloggnitz also achieved the distinction of being able to hold its own market. In 1660 Emperor Leopold I visited Gloggnitz. When the French conqueror Napoleon Bonaparte travelled south across the Semmering Pass in 1809, he also made a short overnight stay in Gloggnitz. On 17 August 1841 Emperor Ferdinand I opened the new Semmering Pass Road. Other visits by famous persons to Gloggnitz include: Emperor Francis Joseph I (1850 and 1854), Crown Prince Rudolph and his wife Princess Gisela (1862). Tourism Semmering Railway The building of the Semmering Railway encouraged further progress. On 5 May 1842, the first train on the \\"S√ºdbahn\\" arrived in Gloggnitz. In its earliest years the railway opened up the mountain scenery to the people of Vienna. Thousands of tourists visited Gloggnitz and went hiking around Vienna's so-called \\"Home Mountains‚Äú, Mount Rax and Mount Schneeberg. In 1854 the railway passage over Semmering was established. The number of Gloggnitz houses and citizens increased steadily between 1796 and 1836. Prior to the arrival of the railway, the town had a rate of growth of 11% in buildings and 14% in population. Between 1836 and 1876 the rate of new building rose to 142% and there was a huge 284% rise in the local population. Gloggnitz was granted town status on 5 May 1926. On 2 January 1927 Federal President Dr Michael Hainisch, Federal Chancellor Dr Ignaz Seipel and the then former Chancellor of State Dr Karl Renner addressed a big audience when they granted Gloggnitz the grant of privileges due to a town. World War II and the unsettled post-war period meant many upheavals in the lives of the citizens of Gloggnitz. There were many structural changes, particularly in relation to the labour market and the development of housing. It took decades until the town regained the opportunity to take measures to boost its tourist industry. In 1972 Gloggnitz became a member of the Semmering-Rax-Schneeberg Tourism Association. This partnership has been beneficial in promoting Gloggnitz and its surrounding area as sites of interest to both national and international visitors. The more-than-900-year-old town of Gloggnitz is still an important traffic junction in the east of Austria and has not lost any of its geographical significance. Alongside municipal buildings, the historical monuments of the town are also being constantly cared for and restored. A new town hall was built and opened in September 2003. In 1992 Gloggnitz was the location of Lower Austria's biggest exhibition, the \\"Lower Austrian Landesausstellung‚Äú. The exhibition provided funds for the full restoration of the former monastery. Today Gloggnitz Provostry is used as a \\"wedding castle\\" and site for various exhibitions.

He also played five Test matches for England. Lucas was educated at Uppingham School and Clare College, Cambridge.

(editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanac; Fifty-Seventh Edition (1920); part I, pp. 278‚Äì279 Lucas did play twice for Surrey and caused a sensation at Prince‚Äôs with an innings of 48 against Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley at their best. His reputation established, Lucas, eighteen, went to Cambridge University in 1875 and solidified his reputation as a batsman with the rare gift of combining style with extremely solid defenceObituary of Alfred ‚ÄúBunny‚Äù Lucas. espncricinfo.comhttp://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/341/341453.html for both the University and in the holidays for Surrey. 1876 saw Lucas advance into the top league of batsmen, with 818 runs at an average of thirty being exceptional for the time and placing him among the top batsmen in the game. 1877 saw Lucas make a further advance, being in average behind only the incomparable W.G. Grace and achieving his highest first-class aggregate for a season of 832 runs. He also showed himself a useful slow bowler, taking 34 wickets for less than fourteen each, and as late as 1882 achieved his best first-class bowling of six wickets for ten runs against his old University for the ‚ÄúGentlemen of England‚Äù ‚Äì Lucas also achieved his highest first-class score of 145 in the same match. However, opinions as to the quality of Lucas‚Äô bowling were not positive even then and he almost never bowled after 1882. Still, Lucas‚Äô batting in the middle to late 1870s was good enough for him to be a regular for the Gentlemen from 1876 and to play for ‚ÄúEngland‚Äù teams against a combined Kent and Gloucestershire team in 1876 and against Gloucestershire alone the following year. Business prevented Lucas touring Australia with the first Test-playing team in 1876/1877, but despite being rather disappointing in his last year at Cambridge Lucas made his only tour in 1878/1879 under Lord Harris, when he did much more bowling than he would ordinarily have done owing to the absence of any specialist bowler except Tom Emmett. Although he played only ten first-class games in 1879 despite being the official captain of Surrey, Lucas returned to form under severely difficult conditions due to the abominable weather and was selected for the first Test team in England the following year, where he made 55, his only fifty in five Tests. At the end of 1882 Lucas moved away from Surrey and played for Middlesex under a birth qualification from 1883, when he remained near the top of the first-class batting averages. He achieved the rare feat of carrying his bat through an innings for the Gentlemen at the Oval, and played an innings of 72 at Lord‚Äôs. Lucas played in the first two Tests of the 1884 season without doing anything worthy of his reputation apart from a dour 15 not out on a sticky wicket in the first match. Owing to his work for the London Stock Exchange, nothing more was seen of Lucas in first-class cricket until 1887, when despite an exceptional summer he was again disappointing. In 1889, coming to the aid of his good friend C.E. Green, Lucas began to play for Essex, in which he had been residing since 1883, and captaining the side until 1894. However, he played only two first-class matches from 1890 to 1893 and when Essex joined the County Championship in 1895, his profession restricted Lucas to a few games in 1895 and 1896. He then played fairly regularly for Essex until 1901, and if not quite the outstanding batsman of twenty years beforehand, Lucas still was a model of soundness and style. His work as a banker again began to severely restrict his cricket from 1902, but whenever he could play Lucas remained valuable up to his last match at the age of fifty. Although known to his chums as ‚ÄúBunny‚Äù, he is referred to in all cricket sources, including contemporary reports, either by his surname or as ‚ÄúA. P. Lucas‚Äù. To the players under his leadership, he was simply ‚ÄúThe Boss‚Äù. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Fryerning, Essex. References External links *Cricinfo page on A. P.

Since retirement, he has presented on TalkSPORT radio and written for both The Times and Ireland's Hot Press magazine. He has worked for both Sky Sports in England and TV3 and Today FM in Ireland. He was a winning participant in the fourth season of the Celebrity Bainisteoir reality television series. Football =Club career= Millwall, Cascarino and Teddy Sheringham scored 99 goals between them. Cascarino joined Gillingham in 1982 from Crockenhill, and according to Cascarino Gillingham donated tracksuits and training equipment to Crockenhill in lieu of a transfer fee. He went on to play for Millwall - the club he supported as a boy. Millwall had missed an opportunity to sign Cascarino as a youngster and subsequently paid The Gills ¬£225,000 to secure his services. Cascarino holds the Ligue 1 record for oldest player to score a hat-trick, which he did while playing for Nancy at age 37 years and 31 days. =International career= Cascarino, who was born in England, represented the Republic of Ireland‚Äîqualifying through his adopted Irish grandfather, Michael O'Malley, who was from Westport, County Mayo. He was also eligible to play for both Scotland and Italy because of his Scottish and Italian descent. He made his international debut against Switzerland in September 1985, during Ireland's ill-fated qualification campaign for the 1986 World Cup. Cascarino would go on to feature for Ireland in three major tournaments: Euro 1988, the 1990 World Cup and the 1994 World Cup. His last international game came against Turkey in late 1999, as Ireland failed to reach UEFA Euro 2000. He got into a brawl with a Turkish defender and left the pitch showing the scars of battle. This marked the end of an international career which had spanned 14 years at the highest level. Irish citizenship controversy In October 2000, Cascarino was the subject of national newspaper headlines when extracts from his upcoming autobiography were published in the Sunday Mirror. In it, he revealed that his mother told him in 1996 that she was adopted and therefore no blood relative to his Irish grandfather. Cascarino said in his autobiography: \\"I didn't qualify for Ireland. I was a fraud. A fake Irishman\\". The FAI's Chief Executive Bernard O'Byrne stated that he was shocked by the announcement and Cascarino's former international manager Jack Charlton questioned why he came forward with the information. Cascarino revealed that Republic of Ireland teammate Andy Townsend had advised him to keep quiet about the situation. Four days after the newspaper exclusive, in November 2000, the Football Association of Ireland issued a short statement: \\"The FAI are satisfied that Tony Cascarino was always eligible to become a citizen of the Republic of Ireland and was, therefore, always eligible to play for Ireland.\\" The Irish Independent reported that Cascarino was given a 'passport of restricted validity' in 1985 and that his mother's name, Theresa O'Malley, was in fact entered in the Foreign Births Register in the Department of Foreign Affairs prior to Cascarino's international debut for the Republic of Ireland. Retirement Since retiring from football, Cascarino has become a semi- professional poker player, having appeared in the television series Celebrity Poker Club and commentating on the PartyPoker Poker Den. He has become something of a cult figure and was referenced in the song \\"All Your Kayfabe Friends\\" by Welsh band Los Campesinos! where the singer tells that \\"You asked if I'd be anyone from history / Fact or fiction, dead or alive / I said I'd be Tony Cascarino, circa 1995.\\" Cascarino joined talkSPORT as a pundit in 2002 and from 2004 he presented the afternoon Drive Time show with Patrick Kinghorn. He was involved in an on-air bust-up with Kinghorn after the latter remarked that the married Cascarino had been \\"chasing that 21-year-old around the office\\", which prompted Cascarino to lunge at Kinghorn and punch him. They pair had to be pulled apart by production staff.Cascarino's on-air punch-up, Brazil's off-air p*ss-ups and Rodney Marsh's depression: 10 true Talksport tales Cascarino left the station in 2005 although still sometimes returns as a guest pundit.

The book detailed his love of gambling, particularly playing all forms of poker, and revealed that his career had been blighted by crippling self-doubt, which he summarised as the \\"little voice\\". The book also candidly refers to his shame over his infidelities and of leaving his wife, Sarah and two sons, Michael and Teddy (who was named after Cascarino's former Millwall teammate Teddy Sheringham) and muses: \\"...maybe, just maybe, I was so wrapped up in my newfound celebrity that I'd become immune to the suffering I was causing\\". He also revealed that during his time at Marseille, he and many other of the club's players were injected by club president Bernard Tapie's personal physician with an unknown substance. The physiotherapist at the time insisted the substance was legal and would provide an \\"adrenaline boost\\". Cascarino claimed that most players accepted the injections and that \\"it definitely made a difference: I felt sharper, more energetic, hungrier for the ball\\". He also later admitted suffering from depression.

He founded the Melbourne Academy, later Scotch College.  Life in Scotland James Forbes was the oldest of the ten children (only five surviving infancy) born to Peter and Margaret Forbes who farmed \\"New Braes\\" on the estate of Sir Arthur Forbes in the parish of Leochel-Cushnie about 40 km west of Aberdeen, Scotland. He was baptised on 4 April 1813, and was educated locally and at Aberdeen Grammar School. He entered King's College, Aberdeen in 1826 and completed the Arts course in 1829 but, like the majority of students who regarded it as an expensive formality, he did not bother to graduate. The Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Garioch records show that he was enrolled in divinity for part of 1829/30, 1830/31 and as a regular student 1831/32. He must have had doubts about his fitness for the ministry for he accepted a teaching appointment at the Colchester Royal Grammar School in England between 1832 and 1835. Here he experienced an evangelical conversion as he heard the sermons given in the school assembly by the Church of England preachers. This brought him back to the divinity course at Aberdeen which he completed in 1837. He was licensed as a preacher by the Presbytery of Garioch on 10 May 1837. Recruited for Australia through the influence of Rev John Dunmore Lang he was ordained with his friend William McIntyre by the Presbytery of Glasgow on 29 June 1837 for work in Australia. Departure for Australia Leaving Greenock on the 541 ton barque Portland on 24 July 1837, Forbes arrived in Sydney on 4 December 1837. The passengers included Dr Lang and a number of other ministers and teachers. Forbes rejected Lang's proposal that the new ministers join him in forming the Synod of New South Wales to rival the existing Presbytery of New South Wales, and duly became a member of the Presbytery. His appointment being for the District of Port Phillip, he arrived there by boat on 20 January 1838. He found his future father-in-law, Rev James Clow, had arrived in Melbourne to settle the previous Christmas Day. Clow was a Church of Scotland chaplain from Bombay retired due to health issues and of independent means. Forbes offered to go to Geelong, but Clow deferred to the younger man with an official appointment. Forbes thus became the first Christian minister settled as such in Melbourne, which was then a settlement of a few huts and two weatherboard houses that served as hotels. Within 18 months the population increased from a few hundred to 3000. Presbyterian beginnings in Melbourne The Olderfleet Buildings, near the site of the first Scots' Church The Scots' Church, Melbourne On Saturday 3 February 1838 a meeting of members and friends of the Church of Scotland was held with James Clow in the chair. It was resolved to build a church and that ¬£300 be raised in order to obtain the matching grant available under the Church Act. This is regarded as the official birthday of Presbyterianism in Victoria and of the beginning of Scots‚Äô Church. A committee of James Clow (treasurer), James Forbes and Skene Graig (secretaries) was appointed to collect subscriptions and to take the steps to obtain a church site. The sum of ¬£139.19.0 was subscribed on the spot. Forbes continued the afternoon service each Sunday in the Pioneers Church on William Street on the corner of Collins Street begun by Clow on 31 December 1837. This communal building had been opened in February 1837 but soon after the land on which it was built was reserved for the Church of England. In April 1838 the Bishop indicated it would not be available for use by others once a resident priest arrived. The Presbyterians resolved to provide their own facilities so Forbes held services in Craig and Broadfoot's store in Collins Street until a temporary timber building called Scots Church was opened in July 1838 on the adjoining site owned by David Fisher. The location was between where the Winfield building now stands (adjoining the old Rialto) (Lot 14 Section 2). It was essentially a large room with a fireplace able to hold about 60 people. The temporary building also served as the Scots' Church School, which was begun on 26 November 1838 with Robert Campbell as teacher. He had come to Australia with Forbes and was a Scots' elder from 1839 until 1842. The school prospered and soon had 80 pupils. The school relocated to new brick premises in September 1839 on the part of the site on the corner of Collins and Russell Streets which adjoins the present Baptist Church and on which Georges department store was later erected. The number of students was soon 150, a third of them girls, and two aboriginal children were among those who received prizes at the first examination in June 1840. The church services also moved to the school. The first purpose built Scots Church on the present site, corner of Collins and Russell Streets, was opened on 3 October 1841. It was designed for 500 sittings and the contract sum was ¬£2,485 without plastering, gallery, vestry or fittings. The building was opened with temporary seating on 3 October 1841, plastering was carried out the following year, proper pews, gallery and vestry were added in 1849 and a spire some years later. (The present building was opened 29 November 1874 seated for 900.) Expansion Forbes visited Geelong in November 1838 and obtained Rev Andrew Love from Scotland as minister for this place. He arrived in April 1840. In 1842 three more ministers were secured and the Synod in Sydney approved Forbes' request for a separate Presbytery of Melbourne to be formed. It held its first meeting on 7 June 1842. Early Societies Forbes was the founding honorary secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society auxiliary founded in 1840, chairman of the Port Phillip Theological Education Society, assisted in the founding of what is now the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Melbourne Debating Society, all in 1841. In 1845 he inaugurated the Presbyterian Female Visiting Society. As it was not sectarian in 1847 it was renamed the Melbourne Ladies Benevolent Society. He supported aboriginal missions established by Wesleyans and Baptists, and was a true friend of all. The Free Kirk The effects of the Disruption of the Established Church of Scotland in May 1843 had repercussions in Australia. Forbes and one of his three elders adhered to the position also adopted by those who formed the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia on 10 October 1846. Reasons of distance and the general desire of those in Port Phillip to run their affairs without control from Sydney, meant Forbes organised a distinct body but on similar lines to the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia, formed as a result of the Disruption. Forbes gave up his handsome stipend (¬£200 from the government plus ¬£150 from the congregation), the church, school and manse he had erected, and commenced afresh. He issued his Protest on 29 October 1846 and submitted it to the Presbytery of Melbourne on 17 November, the date of the organising meeting of what the minutes call The Free Presbyterian Church of Australia Felix. The first service was held in the Mechanics' Hall (where the Athenaeum now stands) on 22 November 1846 with about 200 people crowding the building. The building of John Knox Free Presbyterian Church, Swanston Street was opened 8 May 1848 on the corner with Little Lonsdale Street and with frontage to that street. The John Knox School began in the building on 3 July 1848 with T.J. Everist as teacher. Within a year there were 120 students and an adjoining brick building came into use in August 1850. The congregation erected a two-storey manse next door to the church in Swanston Street late in 1850. The church was reconstructed in 1863 and re-opened by Rev William McIntyre 26 July of that year. It now houses the Church of Christ congregation. Forbes sought to obtain additional ministers for the Free Church. He apparently offended the Irish Church by some critical remarks on some individual Irish ministers who had not stood with him in 1846, so assistance came chiefly from the Free Church of Scotland. Thomas Hastie came from Tasmania in January 1847 and was settled at Buninyong and The Leigh, while Rev J.Z. Huie became minister at Geelong in the same year. Schools were established in both parishes. There was little other help until the explosion of population following the discovery of gold in 1851, the year of Forbes' death. The three ministers and Henrie Bell, elder at John Knox, formed the Synod of the Free Presbyterian Church on 9 June 1847. Forbes showed himself an efficient administrator. He not only wrote the Fundamental Act of the Synod (which was adopted also by the Free Presbyterian Church of South Australia upon its formation 9 May 1854) but he drew up rules for the guidance of the church. His own death plus the revolution caused by the Gold Rush meant his careful positions were modified to facilitate union into the Presbyterian Church of Victoria in 1859. His strong stance against receiving state aid on an indiscriminate basis was modified in 1853. Ironically, the three parishes that ultimately continued the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria and united with the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia in 1953 (East St Kilda, Geelong (Myers Street) and Hamilton/Branxholme) had all benefited from state- aid. Forbes and education Forbes has been called Victoria's First Public Educationist (Edward Sweetman, 1939). He wrote extensively on this subject. The Chalmers Free Church School began in purpose-built premises at what is now 257 Spring Street as a small co-educational school under George McMaster, an experienced Scottish teacher. The school was named after Thomas Chalmers, the first Moderator of the Free Church of Scotland Assembly. the students were transferred to the Knox school in May 1851 and the premises kept ready for the arrival of a rector for a boys college. Forbes was keen to see a superior educational institution which would provide an education in the higher branches of science and literature as 'the first step towards the training of a Colonial ministry from among the Colonial youth.' He personally sought and obtained the assistance of Miss Mure of Warriston, Edinburgh, to guarantee the salary of a rector and so make the project viable. The Academy, as it was called, opened in the Chalmers premises 6 October 1851 with Robert Lawson as rector. The Academy moved to the south-west corner of Spring and Little Collins Streets in 1852, and to East Melbourne in 1854 where it soon adopted the name Scotch College. Forbes died shortly before the opening. Scotch College, now located in Hawthorn, opened the first stage of the impressive buildings of the James Forbes Academy in 2002. Forbes and politics He was an early temperance advocate and, given the variety of religious bodies in the colony, was strongly opposed to churches receiving financial aid from the state. Family life In 1845, Forbes married Helen Clow (1822‚Äì1898). They had four children: * Margaret (1846) who married Robert Chirnside. * James (1847‚Äì1898) who died unmarried and was buried with his parents. * Helen (1849) who married Alexander Creswick. * Charles (1851‚Äì1901), also a bachelor, baptised by his father as his last ministerial act. Death and legacy Forbes' passing was much lamented. In 1855 his remains were removed to the new Melbourne Cemetery and a memorial erected. His name is held in honour still by both the Presbyterian Church of Victoria formed in 1859 as a union of most of the different strands of Presbyterianism, and by those few who continued the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria and who in 1953 united with the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia.

It aired from June 6 to December 16, 2005. It was inspired by the 1973 film of the same name, which starred Vilma Santos and Edgar Mortiz. It was tagged as Pinoy Disney. It was originally based from a comic book series written by Pablo S. Gomez. Directed by Wenn V. Deramas and Andoy Ranay, it stars Anne Curtis, Christian Bautista, Jean Garcia, Eula Valdez, Luis Manzano, Patrick Garcia, Jodi Sta. Maria, Desiree del Valle, and Jomari Yllana. It was re-aired on Jeepney TV from 2013 to 2014 and 2017. Story =Background= Lucia and Lourdes Saavedra are half-sisters. Lucia has fallen in love with Antonio (a poor man of whom her father disapproves), while Lourdes falls in love with Martin. She is unaware that he is Prinsipe Abuk, who has betrayed his people to be human instead of a kuba and who has fallen for Lucia. Lucia marries Antonio; she later believes he was killed from a beating her father engineered. Her maid (and friend) Jacinta told her he was dead to one day win his love. Lucia was also told that her baby daughter was stillborn (although she is sure she heard her cry before she lost consciousness). Lourdes gives birth the same night, delivering a baby girl whom she saw was a kuba before she passed out. Martin switches his baby with Lucia's, leaving his own baby at a church. =The kampanera= The young kuba is named Imang, and grows up to be the kampanera (the person who rings the church bell). She later becomes the nursemaid of Lourdes, and bonds with her immediately. Lourdes' \\"daughter\\" Veronica is jealous and finds comfort with her Aunt Lucia, who has returned home after beginning a new life with her American husband and stepson Luke. Lucia has doubts that Veronica is her daughter, since she has never felt a motherly bond with her. Lourdes is jealous of Lucia's closeness to Martin. The nuns try to help Imang, and brought her back to life after Martin wrongly convinced people she was evil and deserved to be stoned for stealing a sacred crown from the church, with the help of Veronica (who wanted to be with Luke due to her jealously of Imang with him). They later found a candle that, when lit, would make her human. She used this to pretend to be Lucia's long-lost daughter Bernadette to remain close to her mother Lourdes (who, after Imang's \\"death\\", was finally told by the nuns that Imang was really her daughter). Meanwhile, Veronica is angry that Luke has not returned her love and loves Bernadette instead. She uses magic to change her appearance, and adopts the name Agatha to gain her family's trust and avenge Bernadette. Pablo has fallen for Bernadette (although he would always make fun of her as Imang), and the truth about his parentage is raised. Lorenzo loved Imang when she was a kuba. After Lucia's husband Clark dies, she discovers that Antonio did not die; he has lost the use of his legs and believes she betrayed him (when, instead, her father was to blame). She and Antonio discover that Veronica is actually their daughter. =Conclusion= In the end, everybody finds out whose daughter belongs to whom. Bernadette/Imang does not need the candle to remain human. Veronica is turned into a tree for her many misdeeds, and her parents rekindle their marriage while they care for her. Martin is a kuba, and Lourdes still loves him now that he is good. Luke sacrificed his life for Imang/Bernadette; Bernadette chooses to be with Pablo, while Lorenzo finds another who looks like her. Pre-production It was first rumored that Claudine Barretto then Jodi Sta. Maria will get title role for \\"Fatima\\", often referred to as \\"Imang\\", but ABS-CBN picked Anne Curtis instead, shortly after she transferred from GMA Network. On the other hand, Jodi got the role of Veronica. This was a reunion between Eula Valdez and Jean Garcia after their successful show Pangako Sa 'Yo, which ran from 2000 up to 2002, which they played rivals Amor and Claudia. In Kuba they played as sisters. Ten years later, Eula, Jean and Jomari Yllana reunited together in The Half Sisters aired on GMA Network. Jodi left the role, due to pregnancy and was replaced by Desiree Del Valle. This is Patrick Garcia's last show, before moving to GMA Network. Like Eula and Jean, this was also the reunion of Jodi and Patrick after the successful of Pangako Sa 'Yo, Tabing Ilog and Darating ang Umaga.

Over his 11-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, he played for the Texas Rangers, St. Louis Cardinals, Montreal Expos, Baltimore Orioles, and the New York Mets. Tatis holds the major league record for RBIs in an inning, a feat that he achieved by hitting two grand slams in one inning during a game on April 23, 1999, becoming the only player in MLB history ever to do so. Playing career At the age of 17, Tat√≠s was signed as an amateur free agent by Omar Minaya and the Texas Rangers on August 25, 1992. He played his first game in Major League Baseball with the Rangers, at third base, almost five years later on July 26, 1997, and went on to play 60 games with the Rangers in his rookie season. At the trade deadline on July 31, 1998, the Rangers traded Tat√≠s along with Darren Oliver and Mark Little to the St. Louis Cardinals for Royce Clayton and Todd Stottlemyre. Tat√≠s had the best season of his career in 1999 with the St. Louis Cardinals. He hit 34 home runs with 107 RBIs and 21 stolen bases, with a .298 batting average. On April 23, 1999, Tat√≠s made baseball history when he hit two grand slams in one inning. He is the only batter in MLB history to accomplish this feat. Tat√≠s hit both of his grand slams against starting pitcher Chan Ho Park of the Los Angeles Dodgers. With these two grand slams Tat√≠s also set a Major League record with eight runs batted in during a single inning. After playing in only 96 games for the Cardinals in 2000 because of an injury, Tat√≠s was traded to the Montreal Expos along with Britt Reames for Dustin Hermanson and Steve Kline. Tat√≠s played in just 208 games out of a possible 486 over three seasons with the Expos because of an assortment of physical injuries. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays invited Tat√≠s to spring training in 2004, but he did not make the team and was released. Tat√≠s next did not play professional baseball for two seasons and resided in the Dominican Republic. The Baltimore Orioles signed Tat√≠s to a minor-league contract on November 25, 2005. Tat√≠s returned to baseball in order to raise money to build a church. He played most of the season for the AAA baseball, the Ottawa Lynx, eventually playing in 28 games for the Orioles after being called up on July 21, 2006. In 2007, Tat√≠s was invited to spring training with the Los Angeles Dodgers. After being assigned to minor-league baseball camp, Tat√≠s was granted his request to be released from his contract on March 14. Just nine days later, he signed a minor-league contract with the New York Mets, and spent the 2007 season with its AAA affiliate, the New Orleans Zephyrs. On May 11, 2008, Tat√≠s was called up from the Zephyrs to replace √Ångel Pag√°n. Tat√≠s had started to play the outfield in the minor leagues in order to become a more diversified player. On May 28, Tat√≠s hit a walk-off double against Justin Miller to defeat the Florida Marlins in the bottom of the 12th inning. This was Tat√≠s's first career walk-off hit. Tat√≠s played most of his time with the Mets in left field and right field because of injuries to the usual starters Mois√©s Alou and Ryan Church. On September 16, 2008, Tat√≠s separated his shoulder after diving for a fly ball in a game against the Washington Nationals. The Mets team physician diagnosed the injury as being a Grade III separation, but Tat√≠s missed the rest of the 2008 regular season. Despite missing the end of the season, on October 23, 2008, Tat√≠s received the Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award for the National League. Tat√≠s was named to the Dominican Republic national baseball team for the 2009 World Baseball Classic as a replacement for Alex Rodriguez, who was injured. Tat√≠s played intermittently for the Mets in 2009 and 2010. His last Major League game was on July 4, 2010. He was also the latest New York Met to wear uniform number 17, which was taken out of circulation as a mark of respect for Keith Hernandez, who had worn it as a member of the Mets from 1983 to 1989. On October 5, 2014, Tat√≠s announced his retirement as a player. For his career, he batted .265 with 113 home runs and 448 RBIs. Post-playing career In January 2018, the Boston Red Sox announced that Tat√≠s had joined their minor league organization as manager of one of their two rookie-level Dominican Summer League Red Sox teams. Personal life Tat√≠s's father, Fernando Aanonio Tat√≠s, was also a professional baseball player. He was an infielder in the Houston Astros system from 1969 through 1978, reaching as high as Class AAA before retiring and moving on to coaching and scouting Houston's minor leaguers. The elder Tat√≠s disappeared from Fernando's life when he was four years old. The two were not reunited until 1997 when the younger Tat√≠s was a rookie with the Texas Rangers. Rangers scout Omar Minaya, whom Tat√≠s described as a father figure, related the story of Tat√≠s's search for his father to New York Times national baseball writer Murray Chass. Chass wrote about the search and that article led to the reunion of Tat√≠s and his father. His mother is Yudelca Tat√≠s. Tat√≠s's son, Fernando Tat√≠s Jr., is a shortstop for the San Diego Padres. His younger son Elijah is also a baseball player and was signed by the Chicago White Sox in 2019.

Starring Go Soo, Lee Da-hae, Lee Jong-hyuk and Kim Seo-hyung, Green Rose interweaves romance into a story of revenge to offer a fascinating drama. Plot Lee Jung-hyun (Go Soo) and Oh Soo-ah (Lee Da-hae) are living a normal life as a couple until it is revealed that Soo-ah is actually the daughter of Oh Byung-moo (Han Jin-hee), chairman of SR Electronics, the very company he works at. Shocked and hurt that Soo-ah wasn't honest with him, Jung-hyun tries to break up with her but she convinces him to give their relationship another chance. One night, Jung-hyun is summoned to the chairman's vacation house. Inside, Jung-hyun finds the chairman and the housekeeper both on the floor, the former unconscious and the latter dead. When Jung-hyun attempts to carry the chairman out of the house, a fire is started and Jung-hyun is knocked out. After the evidence points to Jung-hyun as the main suspect, he is sentenced to life imprisonment. To give her son a chance to get out of jail and prove his innocence, his mother kills herself. Cornered by policemen and the SWAT team after a long and exhausting car chase, Jung-hyun jumps off a bridge. Believed to be dead by everyone, he flees to Shanghai, China where he struggles to survive. He suffers much, homeless and begging from strangers or scavenging garbage cans for food. Time passes and he meets a Korean man named Lee Choon- bok (Park Sang-myun) who eventually becomes his good friend and guardian who takes good care of him like his own brother and son. He also finds Cha Yoo-ran (Kim Seo-hyung), the chairman's secretary and ex-lover of SR Director Shin Hyun-tae (Lee Jong-hyuk). Yoo-ran decides to help him after Shin orders some men to dispatch her. Under the guidance of Chen Daren, a Chinese business tycoon whose life he and his friends had saved from an assassination attempt, Jung-hyun develops acute business skills and becomes chairman of Super Digital Enterprise, a large Chinese company. After three years, he (under the alias Zhang Zhongyuan), Yoo-ran and Choon-bok return to Korea (wherein upon their return, Jung-hyun still remained under the care of his guardian Choonbok like they were in China) to help him discover the truth and punish the people who framed him. Soo-ah, who is dating Shin Hyun-tae upon his return, immediately sees through his Zhang Zhongyuan facade and recognizes him as Jung-hyun himself. With the help of Soo-ah, Choon-bok and his best friend Kim Dong-wook (Jung Sang-hoon), he discovers that Shin is the person who tried to kill Soo- ah's father. Secretly desiring Soo-ah for years, he also framed Jung-hyun to have her all to himself. Director Seo (Sunwoo Jae-duk), who witnessed the crime, is the man who had hit Jung-hyun on the head and attempted to kill the chairman as well. In the end, Jung-hyun is able to successfully clear his name and Director Seo and Shin commit suicide. He and Soo-ah happily reunite.

Forest eventually became the premier cover artist of French publisher Gallimard's leading French science-fiction paperback imprint, Le Rayon Fantastique, also drawing covers for numerous French newspapers and magazines including France Soir. Together with renowned film director Alain Resnais, Forest was one of the founders of the French Comic-Strip Club in the early 1960s. Forest became world famous when he created the sexy sci-fi strip Barbarella, which was originally published in France in V Magazine in 1962. The strip was an immediate bestseller and was soon translated into a dozen languages. In 1967 it was adapted by Terry Southern and Roger Vadim and made into a major motion picture, with Forest acting as design consultant. Forest created many other cartoons and comic books, also writing scripts for comic strips and for French television. He was awarded the Grand Prize at the 1984 Angoul√™me Comics Festival and in Sierre (Switzerland) in 1986.

It is located south of Elkridge, north of Savage, and close to Baltimore- Washington International Airport (BWI). It is in the southern part of the Baltimore metropolitan area. Dorsey is perhaps listed as a former postal stop that operated from December 1881 on the B&O; railroad and is now a MARC commuter rail system stop, which carries commuters into downtown Baltimore and Washington, D.C.. Dorsey is a stop on MARC's Camden line and contains a large parking lot off Maryland State Highway 100. Dorsey station mainly serves commuters from Elkridge and Ellicott City, as well as the northern parts of Columbia. Howard Transit buses connect Dorsey station with various locations around Howard County as well as with the nearby Arundel Mills mall. Businesses in the area include hotels, warehouses, and satellite campuses for both Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland University College (both of which are located within the Dorsey Business Center). The Dorsey Business Center is a business park developed between 1984 and 1989 by Douglas Legum Development Inc. It was the first large-scale development project in this part of the Baltimore region. The Dorsey Business Center sits on the site of the former Dorsey Speedway, a stock car track, and now contains over two million square feet of office and retail space.

A simple friction hitch, it is used for lengthwise pull along an object rather than at right angles. The rolling hitch is designed to resist lengthwise movement for only a single direction of pull.Clifford W. Ashley, The Ashley Book of Knots (New York: Doubleday, 1944), 292. A common usage while sailing is for rigging a stopper to relax the tension on a sheet so that a jammed winch or block can be cleared.  Naming  Names and reference numbers from ABOK, left to right: \\"Rolling Hitch (1)\\" (#1734), \\"Rolling Hitch (2)\\" (#1735), \\"Magnus Hitch\\" (#1736) At the turn of the 19th century the knot now known as the \\"rolling hitch\\" was called the \\"Magnus hitch\\" or \\"Magner's hitch\\", and the name \\"rolling hitch\\" referred to two round turns and two half-hitches. In 1841 Richard Henry Dana, Jr. used the present-day names in his work The Seaman's Friend, and subsequent authors have continued to use this terminology.Richard Henry Dana, Jr., The Seaman's Friend: A Treatise on Practical Seamanship, 14th Edition (Boston: Thomas Groom & Co., 1879; Dover Republication 1997), 49. There are two slightly different hitches commonly known by the name of \\"rolling hitch\\". The Ashley Book of Knots identifies these two variations as \\"Rolling Hitch (1)\\" and \\"Rolling Hitch (2)\\" and numbers them #1734 and #1735 respectively. Despite the potential for confusion with the older usage, Ashley chose the name \\"Magnus Hitch\\" to refer to knot #1736, which is simply #1734 tied with the final hitch made in the opposite direction.Ashley, 298. Since two distinct variations of the rolling hitch are widely referred to by the same name, and Magnus hitch now may refer to a different knot than it used to, the use of Ashley reference numbers for these related hitches can eliminate ambiguity when required. These hitches are pictured at the right. When a rolling hitch or Magnus hitch is tied around the standing part of the rope to form an adjustable loop, it is often referred to as a taut-line hitch or one of several other names, although some sources fail to differentiate by using a separate name. Ashley shows this use as #1855, #1856 and #1857.Ashley, 310. Tying =Rolling Hitch (1) #1734= This version is preferred when attaching a rope to pole or rod.Nola Trower, Helmsman Guides: Knots and Ropework (Wiltshire: Helmsman Books, 1995), 31-32. It is effectively a clove hitch with an extra initial turn. 550px # Start with a turn around the object. Bring the working end towards the direction of pull and between the standing part and the object. # Make another wrap around the object, completing a round turn. The wraps of the round turn should progress towards the desired direction of pull. Bring the working end out over the standing part away from the direction of pull. # Complete with a half hitch, moving around the object in the same direction as the first turns, as for a clove hitch. # Dress by snugging the hitch around the object before applying load. =Rolling Hitch (2) #1735= This version is preferred when attaching rope to another rope. The first two turns create an awning hitch ‚àí a temporary hitch used by riggers when adjusting tent lines.Ashley, 304. These first two turns are merely a subtle rearrangement in the position of the turns of #1734. 550px # Begin by making a turn around the object, bringing the working end back between the object and the standing part. Cross over the standing part away from the desired direction of pull. # Make a second turn that exactly follows the first, and hence also passes between the object and standing part and then crosses over the standing part, away from the direction of pull. Make sure the second turn \\"tucks\\" between the first turn and the standing part; that is what gives this version extra grip when made around another rope. # Finish with a half hitch, moving around the object in the same direction as the first turns, as for a clove hitch. # Dress by snugging the hitch around the object before applying load. =Magnus Hitch #1736= This is tied exactly as #1734, but with the final hitch in the opposite direction. It can be more tricky to snug-up, since both lines emerge from the same side of the hitch, but it has less tendency to twist under load. 550px # Start with a turn around the object. Bring the working end towards the direction of pull and between the standing part and the object. # Make another wrap around the object, completing a round turn. The wraps of the round turn should progress towards the desired direction of pull. Bring the working end out over the standing part away from the direction of pull. # Complete with a half hitch, moving around the object in the opposite direction as the first turns, as for a cow hitch. # Dress by snugging the hitch around the object before applying load. Security If the hitch is not made very snug before applying any strain, it will not tighten further under load. When hitching to another rope, Ashley and other sourcesBrion Toss, Chapman's Nautical Guides: Knots (New York: Hearst Marine Books, 1990), 30-32. suggest #1735 is more secure. Ashley also states that #1736 has less tendency to twist and marks it ‚Äúbest for the purpose‚Äù. Though effective for moderate loads, the rolling hitch cannot be depended on to hold fast under all conditions. Using stiff and slippery modern fiber ropes, the rolling hitch may be difficult to make hold at all. Friction hitches with additional wraps and more complex structure may provide more security. The August 2009 edition of Practical Sailor magazine tested various knots used for lengthwise tension applications, and came to the conclusion that when using modern synthetic rope the rolling hitch could not be regarded as secure. They recommended the Icicle hitch as a replacement.

The core principle of fluid balance is that the amount of water lost from the body must equal the amount of water taken in; for example, in humans, the output (via respiration, perspiration, urination, defecation, and expectoration) must equal the input (via eating and drinking, or by parenteral intake). Euvolemia is the state of normal body fluid volume, including blood volume, interstitial fluid volume, and intracellular fluid volume; hypovolemia and hypervolemia are imbalances. Water is necessary for all life on Earth. Humans can survive for 4 to 6 weeks without food but only for a few days without water. Profuse sweating can increase the need for electrolyte replacement. Water-electrolyte imbalance produces headache and fatigue if mild; illness if moderate, and sometimes even death if severe. For example, water intoxication (which results in hyponatremia), the process of consuming too much water too quickly, can be fatal. Deficits to body water result in volume contraction and dehydration. Diarrhea is a threat to both body water volume and electrolyte levels, which is why diseases that cause diarrhea are great threats to fluid balance. Applications =Water consumption= The amount of water varies with the individual, as it depends on the condition of the subject, the amount of physical exercise, and on the environmental temperature and humidity. In the US, the reference daily intake (RDI) for water is 3.7 litres per day (l/day) for human males older than 18, and 2.7 l/day for human females older than 18US daily reference intake values including water contained in food, beverages, and drinking water. The common misconception that everyone should drink two litres (68 ounces, or about eight 8-oz glasses) of water per day is not supported by scientific research. Various reviews of all the scientific literature on the topic performed in 2002 and 2008 could not find any solid scientific evidence that recommended drinking eight glasses of water per day.Research debunks health value of guzzling water. Reuters, April 2008.H. Valtin, Drink at least eight glasses of water a day.\\" Really? Is there scientific evidence for \\"8 √ó 8\\"? Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 283: R993-R1004, 2002. For example, people in hotter climates will require greater water intake than those in cooler climates. An individual's thirst provides a better guide for how much water they require rather than a specific, fixed number. A more flexible guideline is that a normal person should urinate 4 times per day, and the urine should be a light yellow color. A constant supply is needed to replenish the fluids lost through normal physiological activities, such as respiration, perspiration and urination. Food contributes 0.5 to 1 l/day, and the metabolism of protein, fat, and carbohydrates produces another 0.25 to 0.4 l/day,Swedish DFA (in Swedish) which means that 2 to 3 l/day of water for men and 1 to 2 l/day of water for women should be consumed as fluid to meet the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI). Trace elements In terms of mineral nutrients intake, it is unclear what the drinking water contribution is. However, inorganic minerals generally enter surface water and ground water via storm water runoff or through the Earth's crust. Treatment processes also lead to the presence of some minerals. Examples include calcium, zinc, manganese, phosphate, fluoride and sodium compounds.World Health Organization (WHO). Geneva, Switzerland. Joyce Morrissey Donohue, Charles O. Abernathy, Peter Lassovszky, George Hallberg. \\"The contribution of drinking-water to total dietary intakes of selected trace mineral nutrients in the United States.\\" Draft, August 2004. Water generated from the biochemical metabolism of nutrients provides a significant proportion of the daily water requirements for some arthropods and desert animals, but provides only a small fraction of a human's necessary intake. There are a variety of trace elements present in virtually all potable water, some of which play a role in metabolism. For example, sodium, potassium and chloride are common chemicals found in small amounts in most waters, and these elements play a role in body metabolism. Other elements such as fluoride, while arguably beneficial in low concentrations, can cause dental problems and other issues when present at high levels. Water is essential for the growth and maintenance of our bodies, as it is involved in a number of biological processes. =Medical use= Effects of illness When a person is ill, fluid may also be lost through vomiting, diarrhea, and hemorrhage. An individual is at an increased risk of dehydration in these instances, as the kidneys will find it more difficult to match fluid loss by reducing urine output (the kidneys must produce at least some urine in order to excrete metabolic waste.) Oral rehydration therapy Oral rehydration therapy (ORT), is type of fluid replacement used as a treatment for dehydration. In an acute hospital setting, fluid balance is monitored carefully. This provides information on the patient's state of hydration, kidney function and cardiovascular function. * If fluid loss is greater than fluid gain (for example if the patient vomits and has diarrhea), the patient is said to be in negative fluid balance. In this case, fluid is often given intravenously to compensate for the loss. * On the other hand, a positive fluid balance (where fluid gain is greater than fluid loss) might suggest a problem with either the kidney or cardiovascular system. If blood pressure is low (hypotension), the filtration rate in the kidneys will lessen, causing less fluid reabsorption and thus less urine output. An accurate measure of fluid balance is therefore an important diagnostic tool, and allows for prompt intervention to correct the imbalance. Routes of fluid loss and gain Fluid can leave the body in many ways. Fluid can enter the body as preformed water, ingested food and drink and to a lesser extent as metabolic water which is produced as a by-product of aerobic respiration (cellular respiration) and dehydration synthesis.Saladin, Kenneth S. Water, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Balance (New York: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., 2010), 943-944. =Input= A constant supply is needed to replenish the fluids lost through normal physiological activities, such as respiration, sweating and urination. Water generated from the biochemical metabolism of nutrients provides a significant proportion of the daily water requirements for some arthropods and desert animals, but provides only a small fraction of a human's necessary intake. In the normal resting state, input of water through ingested fluids is approximately 1200 ml/day, from ingested foods 1000 ml/day and from aerobic respiration 300 ml/day, totaling 2500 ml/day. Page 829 Regulation of input Input of water is regulated mainly through ingested fluids, which, in turn, depends on thirst. An insufficiency of water results in an increased osmolarity in the extracellular fluid. This is sensed by osmoreceptors in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, which trigger thirst. Thirst can to some degree be voluntarily resisted, as during fluid restriction. The human kidneys will normally adjust to varying levels of water intake. The kidneys will require time to adjust to the new water intake level. This can cause someone who drinks a lot of water to become dehydrated more easily than someone who routinely drinks less. =Output= * The majority of fluid output occurs via the urine, approximately 1500 ml/day (approx 1.59 qt/day) in the normal adult resting state. * Some fluid is lost through perspiration (part of the body's temperature control mechanism) and as water vapor in exhaled air. These are termed \\"insensible fluid losses\\" as they cannot be easily measured. Some sources say insensible losses account for 500 to 650 ml/day (0.5 to 0.6 qt.) of water in adults, while other sources put the minimum value at 800 ml (0.8 qt.).3.2 Insensible Water Loss In children, one calculation used for insensible fluid loss is 400 ml/m2 body surface area. * In addition, an adult loses approximately 100 ml/day of fluid through feces. * For females, an additional 50 ml/day is lost through vaginal secretions. These outputs are in balance with the input of ~2500 ml/day. Regulation of output The body's homeostatic control mechanisms, which maintain a constant internal environment, ensure that a balance between fluid gain and fluid loss is maintained. The anti-diuretic hormones vasopressin (ADH) and aldosterone play a major role in this. * If the body is becoming fluid- deficient, there will be an increase in the secretion of these hormones, causing fluid to be retained by the kidneys and urine output to be reduced. * Conversely, if fluid levels are excessive, secretion of these hormones is suppressed, resulting in less retention of fluid by the kidneys and a subsequent increase in the volume of urine produced. =Antidiuretic hormone= If the body is becoming fluid-deficient, this will be sensed by osmoreceptors in the vascular organ of lamina terminalis and subfornical organ. These areas project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, which contain neurons that secrete the antidiuretic hormone, vasopressin, from their nerve endings in the posterior pituitary. Thus, there will be an increase in the secretion of antidiuretic hormone, causing fluid to be retained by the kidneys and urine output to be reduced. =Aldosterone= A fluid-insufficiency causes a decreased perfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. This activates the renin‚Äìangiotensin system. Among other actions, it causes renal tubules (i.e. the distal convoluted tubules and the cortical collecting ducts) to reabsorb more sodium and water from the urine. Potassium is secreted into the tubule in exchange for the sodium, which is reabsorbed. The activated renin‚Äìangiotensin system stimulates the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex which in turn secretes the hormone aldosterone. This hormone stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ions from distal tubules and collecting ducts. Water in the tubular lumen cannot follow the sodium reabsorption osmotically, as this part of the kidney is impermeable to water; release of ADH (vasopressin) is required to increase expression of aquaporin channels in the cortical collecting duct, allowing reabsorption of water.

M6G is formed from morphine by the enzyme UGT2B7. It has analgesic effects more potent than morphine. M6G can accumulate to toxic levels in kidney failure. History of discovery This analgesic activity of M6G (in animals) was first noted by Yoshimura. Subsequent work at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London in the 1980s, using a sensitive and specific HPLC assay, accurately defined for the first time the metabolism of morphine, and the abundance of this metabolite (along with morphine-3-glucuronide,Renal tubular transport of morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, and morphine-3-glucuronide in the isolated perfused rat kidney. JT Van Crugten, BC Sallustio, RL Nation and AA Somogyi. Department of Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology, University of Adelaide, Australia. considered an inactive metabolite). It was postulated that kidney impairment would result in accumulation of the kidney-excreted active agent M6G, leading to potentially fatal toxicity such as respiratory depression. The frequent use of morphine in critically ill patients, and the common occurrence of kidney failure in this group implied that M6G accumulation could be a common, but previously unanticipated problem. The first studies demonstrated massive levels of M6G in 3 patients with kidney failure, which resolved as kidney function returned. Accumulation of M3G and M6G also decrease with return of kidney function after kidney transplantation. A key step in defining the importance of M6G in humans came in 1992 when the substance was artificially synthesised and administered to patients with pain, the majority of whom described pain relief.

He authored 17 volumes of religious writings entitled Epiphany Studies in the Scriptures, and published two magazines from about 1918 until his death in 1950. The movement he created continues his work and publishes his writings, operating from Chester Springs, Pennsylvania. He was born in Titusville, Pennsylvania on October 4, 1873, to Jewish parents who had recently immigrated from Poland. His father was a prominent Hebrew scholar, and eventually became president of the Titusville synagogue. His mother died when he was 12, and his father remarried, both of which caused him distress; he ran away from home several times. He eventually converted to Christianity and joined the Methodist Church. In 1890, he entered the Capital University of Columbus, Ohio, and graduated in 1895 with high honors. Records in that University's Library show him enrolled as Paul Levitsky; he then went to the Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and graduated in 1898. He pastored a Lutheran church for a short time in Mars, Pennsylvania, and was then transferred back to Columbus, Ohio, at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, which was later razed to make way for highway infrastructure. He soon built a new church building and was noted (by the Capitol University Synod) to have baptized more people and collected less money than any other pastor in the synod. In May 1903 he left the Lutheran Church as a consequence of changes in his beliefs, and began fellowship with the Columbus Ecclesia of the Watch Tower Society. The Lutheran Church later claimed they had disfellowshipped him for heresy, but he had already left them of his own free will. One year later (to the day) Pastor Charles Taze Russell appointed him as a Pilgrim of the Bible Student movement. He eventually served as Russell's personal secretary. In time, he became Russell's most trusted friend and advisor. Johnson suffered a nervous breakdown in 1910 a result of withstanding dissidents from within who were challenging the teachings of Pastor C.T. Russell on questions around his understanding of the new covenant and the ransom for all. Johnson left the Watch Tower Society when Joseph F. Rutherford took over its direction after Russell's death. He founded the Laymen's Home Missionary Movement in 1920, and served on its board of directors from 1920 until his death on October 22, 1950.

The army liberated Western Slavonia in May and areas of Banovina, Kordun, Lika and Dalmatia in August. Both areas were reincorporated into the republic.

The Mostar regime issued stamps inscribed BOSNA I HERCEGOVINA for four years. Some issues referred to Croatia itself. When the Dayton Agreement was finalised in November 1995, the Mostar regime amalgamated with the Sarajevo government to form the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the Bosnian Serb Republic remained separate.

Aaron Wildavsky (May 31, 1930 ‚Äì September 4, 1993) was an American political scientist known for his pioneering work in public policy, government budgeting, and risk management. He died of lung cancer on September 4, 1993, in Oakland, California.http://contemporarythinkers.org/aaron- wildavsky/biography/ Early years A native of Brooklyn in New York, Wildavsky was the son of two Ukrainian Jewish immigrants. After graduating from Brooklyn College, he served in the U.S. Navy and then won a Fulbright Fellowship to the University of Sydney for 1954‚Äì55. Wildavsky returned to the U.S. to attend graduate school at Yale University. His PhD dissertation, a study of the politics of the Dixon-Yates atomic energy controversy, was completed in 1958. Career Wildavsky taught at Oberlin College from 1958 until 1962, then lived and worked in Washington D.C for a year before moving to the University of California at Berkeley where he worked as a professor of political science for the rest of his life. At Berkeley, he was chairman of the political science department (1966‚Äì1969) and founding dean of the Graduate School of Public Policy (1969‚Äì1977). Wildavsky was president of the American Political Science Association for 1985‚Äì86. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration. Wildavsky was a scholar on budgeting and budget theory. He is associated with the idea of incrementalism in budgeting, meaning that the most important predictor of a future political budget is the prior one; not a rational economic or decision process undertaken by the state. His book Politics of the Budgetary Process was named by the American Society for Public Administration as the third most influential work in public administration in the last fifty years. In Searching for Safety (1988), Wildavsky argued that trial and error, rather than the precautionary principle, is the best way to manage risks. He noted that rich, technologically advanced societies were the safest, as measured by life expectancy and quality of life. Precautionary approaches to approving new technology are irrational, he said, because they demand that we know whether something is safe before we can do the very tests that would demonstrate its safety or dangerousness. Furthermore, precaution eliminates the benefits of new technology along with the harms. He advocated enhancing society's capacity to cope with and adapt to the unexpected, rather than trying to prevent all catastrophes in advance. Wildavsky was a prolific author, writing or co-writing thirty-nine books and numerous journal articles, including important works on the budgetary process, policy analysis, political culture, foreign affairs, public administration, and comparative government. Five more books were published posthumously‚Äîbringing the total to forty-four. Wildavsky was the recipient of the 1996 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order, with Max Singer. Wildavsky was awarded multiple honorary degrees over the course of his life, including degrees from Yale University and the University of Bologna.http://contemporarythinkers.org/aaron-wildavsky/biography/ Managing risk Wildavsky argued that a mixed strategy of anticipation and resilience is optimal for managing risk. Anticipation is beneficial, but if employed as the sole strategy the law of diminishing returns makes it unattractive, impractical, impossible and even counter productive (it consumes resources better spent on resilience). We should accept to live with small accidents and mishaps and not try to prevent all future hazards. He argued that adding safety devices to nuclear power plants beyond a certain point would be detrimental to safety.Searching for safety (1988) chapter 6 This critique is a fundamental attack on the precautionary principle. > The question, as always, is one of proportion (How much of each strategy?) > and relevance (What kinds of dangers deserve the different strategies?), and > ultimately, given uncertainty, of bias (When in doubt, which strategy should > receive priority?). ... Trial and error is a device for courting small > dangers in order to avoid or lessen the damage from big ones. Sequential > trials by dispersed decision makers reduce the size of that unknown world to > bite-sized, and hence manageable, chunks. An advantage of trial and error, > therefore, is that it renders visible hitherto unforeseen errors. Because it > is a discovery process that discloses latent errors so we can learn how to > deal with them, trial and error also lowers risk by reducing the scope of > unforeseen dangers. Trial and error samples the world of as yet unknown > risks; by learning to cope with risks that become evident as the result of > small-scale trial and error, we develop skills for dealing with whatever may > come our way from the world of unknown risks.Searching for safety (1988):37 Theory of dual presidency During the Cold War, Wildavsky proposed \\"The Dual Presidency Theory\\" (also sometimes referred to as the Two Presidencies Thesis). Influenced by the time period of 1946‚Äì1964, the Dual Presidency Theory is based on the principle that there are two versions of the American President: one who is concerned with domestic policy and one concerned with foreign policy. Wildavsky makes the claim that presidents would prefer to focus foremost on foreign policy because he is granted more traditional, constitutional, and statutory authority when compared to his domestic policy powers. Wildavsky argues that presidents have assumed a more active role with regard to foreign policy because they are able to act more quickly than the United States Congress when pursuing foreign policy. Also, a lack of interest groups active in foreign policy allow the president more discretion when making a decision. Select publications * Dixon-Yates: A Study in Power Politics. 1962.

Lisht or el-Lisht () is an Egyptian village located south of Cairo. It is the site of Middle Kingdom royal and elite burials, including two pyramids built by Amenemhat I and Senusret I. The two main pyramids were surrounded by smaller pyramids of members of the royal family, and many mastaba tombs of high officials and their family members. They were constructed throughout the Twelfth and Thirteenth Dynasties. The site is also known for the tomb of Senebtisi, found undisturbed and from which a set of jewelry has been recovered. The pyramid complex of Senusret I is the best preserved from this period. The coffins in the tomb of Sesenebnef present the earliest versions of the Book of the Dead.

It is a Twelfth Dynasty necropolis, close to the city of Itj-Tawy. The Eleventh Dynasty‚Äôs capital was located at the city of Thebes. The first king of the Twelfth Dynasty, Amenemhet I, moved the capital from Thebes to a city near el-Lisht called Itj-tawy, because it was close to the mouth of the Fayyum, and well situated to control the 'Two Lands' of Upper and Lower Egypt. Another motive suggested is land reclamation and desire to increase the agricultural output for the region. The ruins of Itj-Tawy have never been conclusively identified, and the only locational evidence discovered consists of pieces of pottery in the area it is believed to be in. However, Twelfth Dynasty rulers built pyramids at el-Lisht which are known to researchers. El-Lisht is the necropolis of the first two rulers of Dynasty XII, Amenemhet I and his son and successor Senusret I. These pyramids would have been visible to those traveling to Itj-Tawy from the south. The more famous of the two monumental complexes, that of Amenemhat I, featured an offering hall with a granite altar, carved with depictions of representatives of the nomes (provinces) bringing offerings to the pharaoh. However, the pyramid itself is in a ruined state, rising approximately above ground level. =Excavations= El-Lisht was first excavated in 1882 by the French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero. Maspero was from Paris but had an interest for the history of Egypt so went on to study under Auguste Mariette. When Mariette died Maspero took on the archeological mission. His interest in ancient Egypt originally took him there to excavate for the French government but later he went on to found the French Institute for Oriental Archaeology. This group further excavated the site from 1884 until 1885. From 1906 to 1934 the Egyptian Expedition of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, continued to work on el-Lisht. In this time period Egyptologists were able to excavate for fourteen seasons. The Metropolitan Museum of Art returned to el-Lisht between 1984 and 1991. =North Side of el-Lisht- Pyramid of Amenemhet I= The pyramid of Amenemhet I was about 55 meters tall when originally built but because of poor construction, quarrying and tomb robberies, it now stands at approximately 20m in height. Apart from poor construction, the material used to build the pyramid was not durable. Studies show it was made from unfired mudbrick and stones from other monuments. The mudbrick, sand and debris would have been the material of choice since each was readily available, and mudbrick proved cheap since the city was so close to the Fayyum. Specifically, stones from the monuments of Khufu, Khafre, Unas and Pepy have been found at Amenemhat's funerary complex. Subsequent excavations uncovered plans for a pyramid much larger than the building actually constructed. One theory is that the terrain of the site was unsuitable for the structure due to poor sloping topography. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the pharaoh's health could have been declining and he did not think he would live to see it finished in time, yet did not want to be buried in an unfinished tomb. A third theory holds that Amenemhat I had already died after designing the tomb, and his son and successor rushed through his father's memorial so that he could start construction on his own. The pyramid's true entrance is found on its north side. From here, a hallway lined with pink granite leads to a small room at the core of the pyramid, from where a shaft connects to the burial chamber. The chamber has been filled with Nile seepage water over the years, making new discoveries difficult. Attempts have been made to keep water out but pumping has not worked. No full statues of Amenemhat I were unearthed during archaeological expeditions. However, a limestone statuette's head, thought to belong to an image of the pharaoh, has been discovered. =South side of el- Lisht- Pyramid of Senusret I= Senusret I built his pyramid on the southern side of el-Lisht, around a mile south of his father's funerary complex. This pyramid, named 'Senusret Looks Down on Both Lands' was also discovered by Gaston Maspero in 1882. He was able to identify the owner from objects in the pyramid marked with the pharaoh's name. The excavation team found relief blocks, fragments, and small shrines on the site that were consistent with Middle Kingdom art. Then in 1894 the site was excavated by archeologists J.E. Gautier and G. Jequier who worked there until 1895. From 1906 until 1943 a team from the Metropolitan Museum of Art excavated it. Later, from 1984 to 1987, further excavation was carried out by Dieter Arnold. The pyramid of Senusret I was much larger than that of Amenemhet I. Its base was 105 meters wide, with a height that once reached 61.25 meters tall. Although he followed a similar plan to that of his father, architects used a new technique. In theory this new technique was supposed to make the pyramid stronger. The architects built outward from a core of coarse limestone blocks filled in with mudbrick and debris, then revetted the central structure with heavy blocks and surrounded it with a smooth casing of white limestone from Tureh. This technique continued to be used for much of the Middle Kingdom. The unroofed causeway leading to the pyramid was punctuated with alcoves in which stood large limestone statues of Senusret I\\\\- some of these are now on show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and at the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo. The causeway was also flanked by mudbrick buildings for the use of the priests who would perform rituals for the deceased monarch. The north side of the pyramid was fronted by a small chapel with an alabaster false-door stela, decorated with pictures of offerings being presented. The funerary temple lay to the east, at the head of the valley causeway leading to the pyramid, and was similar in style to that of Pepi II, a Sixth Dynasty pharaoh. The central passage within the pyramid led to a burial chamber containing sculpted lion heads that would sprout water out which would flow away through a drain. While some of the inner framework of Senusret's pyramid has been preserved, the pyramid itself is almost all rubble. The burial chamber is flooded by Nile seepage water, and many of the pyramid's treasures were stolen in antiquity. According to the excavations, the tomb was robbed shortly after being sealed. Besides the central tomb passage, another tunnel has been found, its use being to transport funerary materials to the chambers. Maspero concluded that the transporting tunnel was used by thieves to rob the pyramid, because this is where funerary goods from the king‚Äôs chambers were found. =Funerary Temples at el-Lisht= Both Amenemhet I and Senusret I had funerary temples, but archeologists know more about Senusret because his fathers is almost completely destroyed. The only remains of Amenemhet I funerary temple are carvings of Nile god and Nome deities. It is thought that Senusret had Amenemhet rebuilt because his name is on the foundation of the temple remains. Since there is more left of Senusret I's temple, it was easier to reconstruct the original architectural plan for it. We know it was similar to those found in Dynasty VI with a courtyard, portico, and offering hall with store rooms on either side. Years later, the tombs of wives, children and close officials began to be plotted around the temples of these kings. It turned into a honeycomb of graves for their families and servants that multiplied with each generation. After the fall of the dynasty, the necropolis was no longer thought to be in need of guarding so grave robbers and looters descended. =Conclusions= Through excavating this site, archaeologists were able to learn a few things, even if the remains were not in pristine condition. el-Lisht is notable for its commissioners' 'cannibalization' of earlier monuments, which is thought to symbolize the restoration of Egypt to its Old Kingdom glory. The change of relief carving styles in the Twelfth Dynasty is also apparent in the two pyramids at this site.

It is known to occur in aqueous solutions, but it has not been isolated as a pure material, although this fact does not detract from the significance of As(OH)3. Properties As(OH)3 is a pyramidal molecule consisting of three hydroxyl groups bonded to arsenic. The 1H NMR spectrum of arsenous acid solutions consists of a single signal consistent with the molecule's high symmetry. In contrast, the nominally related phosphorous acid H3PO3 adopts the structure HPO(OH)2. The structural analogue of arsenous acid (P(OH)3) is a very minor equilibrium component of such solutions. The differing behaviors of the As and P compounds reflect a trend whereby high oxidation states are more stable for lighter members of main group elements than their heavier congeners. One tautomer of arsenous acid is HAsO(OH)2, which is called arsonic acid. It has not been isolated or well-characterized. Phosphorous acid exists in as the dihydroxy tautomer in contrast to arsenous acid. Synthesis The preparation of As(OH)3 involves a slow hydrolysis of arsenic trioxide in water. Addition of base converts arsenous acid to the arsenite ions [AsO(OH)2]‚àí, [AsO2(OH)]2‚àí, and [AsO3]3‚àí. Reactions With its first pKa being 9.2, As(OH)3 is a weak acid. Reactions attributed to aqueous arsenic trioxide are due to arsenous acid and its conjugate bases. Like arsenic trioxide, arsenous acid is sometimes amphoteric. For example, it reacts with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydroiodic acids to produce arsenic trichloride, tribromide, and triiodide. :As(OH)3 \\\\+ 3 HCl ‚áå AsCl3 \\\\+ 3 H2O :As(OH)3 \\\\+ 3 HBr ‚áå AsBr3 \\\\+ 3 H2O :As(OH)3 \\\\+ 3 HI ‚áå AsI3 \\\\+ 3 H2O Reaction of arsenous acid with methyl iodide gives methylarsonic acid.

It lies on the River Tyne east of Hexham with neighbours Prudhoe, Ovington, Wylam and Stocksfield. The River Tyne provided an obstacle between Ovingham and Prudhoe until 20 December 1883, when a toll bridge (Ovingham Bridge) was finally opened, taking the place of the ferry. The steel tubes are marked Dorman Long Middlesbrough, the firm which designed and built the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Tyne Bridge.  Governance  Ovingham is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham. Economy There was a dyehouse at Ovingham, and in 1828 William Bullock was the foreman. Both Thomas Bewick from nearby Cherryburn and George Stephenson from nearby Wylam had relatives who were dyers. One of Bewick's woodcuts is entitled the Dyers of Ovingham. Two men are carrying a large tub on a pole. Mabel Stephenson, George's mother, was a daughter of an Ovingham dyer named Richard Carr. There were weavers in Ovingham, as well as a local tidewaiter, or customs inspector. Landmarks The vicarage was, in medieval times, a cell for three Augustinian canons of Hexham, and was rebuilt in the seventeenth century. It was formerly the residence of the late Frank Atkinson, who did so much to establish the Beamish Museum and also the Bewick Trust at Cherryburn. Bewick received his education in the vicarage and the church. The Ovingham 'pack- horse' bridge over the Whittle Burn consisted of two segmental arches with a width of five feet between the parapets, so that it could not be used for wheeled traffic. It is likely that the Ovingham mill dam on the Tyne raised the level of the water. There was a great fire at Ovingham in 1697 and the bridge fell down. So the bridge which previously stood was repaired or rebuilt in 1698. There is also a concrete bridge over the water for traffic, which in time of flood becomes a ford. The bridge was destroyed in flooding on 5 December 2015. Whittle dean is a deep woody dell which stretches southwards & joins the Tyne east of Ovington. The waters of this dean (peculiarly soft & clear) are the most celebrated in the north of England for whitening linen cloth. Mr. William Newton's bleach green, situated on this stream at the confluence of the Tyne is known and famed throughout all these northern parts. (Mackenzie 1825). The Whittle Burn can be traced back to the present day Whittledean Water Works on either side of the Roman Wall near Welton Hall. The first three trees of the Ovingham Community Orchard were planted in the old grazing field next to the allotments by children from Ovingham First School on Friday 23 November 2018. The following morning about 40 villagers turned out to plant the remaining 21 trees. Each tree will produce a different variety of apple.  Transport  ;Railway Prudhoe railway station The village is served by Prudhoe railway station on the Tyne Valley Line. The line was opened in 1838, and links the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in Tyne and Wear with Carlisle in Cumbria. The line follows the course of the River Tyne through Northumberland. Passenger services on the Tyne Valley Line are operated by Northern. The line is also heavily used for freight. The railway station is across the River Tyne on the south bank of the river. ;Road The village lies about south of the A69 road giving good links with Newcastle upon Tyne, Hexham, and Carlisle. The A695 road is accessible across Ovingham Bridge giving access to places on the south side of the River Tyne including Gateshead.  Education  Ovingham has two schools, Ovingham Middle School and Ovingham CE First School. Ovingham Middle School educates 358 children, aged 9‚Äì13. Church The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary has a tall slender Anglo-Saxon tower. There are fragments of an Anglo-Saxon cross in the church, which was much enlarged in the 13th century ‚Äì wider, loftier and with long lancet windows. The nave with aisles is only two bays long, as the north and south transepts, each with a west aisle, take up the space of two more bays. There is a long chancel with very little ornament. The churchyard has a number of gravestones in memory of prominent villagers. In the porch is a stone slab commemorating Thomas Bewick who is buried in the churchyard, next to the tower. Markets and fairs Ovingham had a charter for a market and two annual fairs on 26 October and 26 April. There was also a monthly tryst for cattle and sheep, which was discontinued in 1823. The ceremony for the Fair was similar to that for the Stagshaw Bank Fair at Corbridge nearby. A procession moved to the principal alehouse for the 'riding of the fair', led by the Duke of Northumberland's pipers, dressed in light blue and adorned with the Duke's sign of a crescent moon. The procession included the Duke's agent, bailiff, constable with many farmers and tenants. The fair was proclaimed and then they beat the bounds, returning to the tavern to drink the Duke's health from punch provided by him. After this men, women and children alike went to enjoy the amusements ‚Äì stalls, Punch and Judy and performers such as fire- breathers. The custom was discontinued in time, but it has been revived in recent years as the 'Goose Fair', since in the days of the old Fair geese would play an important part in the sale. Quill pens were made in Ovingham from goose feathers.

The civil parish population at the 2011 Census was 1,195. History A hoard of Roman coins found between Hagg House Farm and Morton Lodge Farm is the first evidence of human activity in the Morton area. The coins have been dated at 210 AD. Morton is first documented in the will of Wulfric Spott in 1002 and again mentioned in 1086 in the Domesday Book as one of the manors belonging to Walter D'Aincourt (Deincourt). The manor of Morton remained in the ownership of the Deincourts until the family line died out and then passed through several hands until being acquired by the Sitwells (of Renishaw) in 1749. The Sitwells disposed of the Morton estate in 1912. The Midland Railway opened a station at Doe Hill in 1862. In 1865 George Stephenson's Clay Cross Company opened their first colliery in Morton. Most of the houses now in Morton were built to house the colliery workers. See separate sections below for history of church, school and colliery. Claims to be centre of England According to the roadsigns entering Morton, the village is the geographical centre of England. Morton has a claim to be at the centre of England as it is midway along the longest North ‚Äì South Axis (Near Berwick upon Tweed to Poole) and is also midway between the Welsh border (Close to Dodleston) and the East Coast (at Skegness). The Ordnance Survey define Fenny Drayton to be the Geographical centre of England, and Coton in the Elms to be the Farthest point from the Sea. Historically Meriden has been regarded as the centre of England for over 200 years, despite being closer to the South Coast than it is to Berwick-upon-Tweed. The position of the centre-of-England point is an oak tree opposite to no 69 Stretton Road (near the western end of the village). A plaque was erected by the Parish Council in the 1990s to identify the particular tree. Morton Church Morton ‚Äì Holy Cross Church Morton Church of the Holy Cross has a long history, although most of the current church building dates from 1850. The 1086 Domesday book identifies Morton as a parish with a church, but there is evidence of there being a church in Saxon times. The arcade dates from the thirteenth century and the tower (at the west end) from the fifteenth century. The remainder of the church results from a rebuild by T.C. Hine of Nottingham in 1850. The church is a Grade II* listed building. Education Morton ‚Äì First (1863) School The first Morton school opened in 1863. It was a single- room stone building known as the Old Dames School, near the church. It was replaced in 1884 by a building on the site of the current primary school. This school cost ¬£600 and had an average attendance of 192 pupils. Most of the current school results from a 1927 rebuild to a design of George H. Widdows. A building extension, sympathetic to the Widdows design and costing ¬£892,000 was officially opened in 2010. Morton Colliery Morton ‚Äì Pit-Head Buildings The mining industry transformed Morton from a small agricultural community into a much larger village based around the employment that its colliery offered. The colliery was opened by the Clay Cross Company in 1865 and it closed a hundred years later in 1965. At its peak, there were 1,033 employees (in 1956) and highest coal output was 390,472 tons (in 1955). There were 55 fatalities during the life of the mine. The pit-head baths were built in 1936. The baths were brick-built, with elements of Art Deco styling, and the pit-head buildings now form part of a small industrial estate. Water ingress was always a problem with this mine and the shafts were kept open and pumping of water was continued from the date of mine closure until 1990 to protect neighbouring operational pits from flooding. Village facilities Morton ‚Äì The Corner Pin As at March 2015, Morton has the benefit of: * A post office and general stores. * A village hall: This was once a brewery, but is now run by the Parish Council as a meeting place for local groups and for private hire. * Two public Houses: The Sitwell Arms and The Corner Pin. * A cricket club: Morton Colliery Cricket Club fields three teams in local leagues. There are also junior teams. The ground off Back Lane boasts a bar and an electronic scoreboard. The club celebrated its 150th year in 2015. * Two country parks: Morton Colliery Plantation and Doe Hill Country Park. Morton, Tibshelf, Blackwell and Shirland & Higham parish councils form the Doe Hill Community Park Advisory Panel. * A children's playground off of New Street. * Bus services to nearby towns: There are regular daytime weekday commercially provided bus services to Alfreton, Chesterfield and Sutton-in-Ashfield. There are some subsidised services to other destinations.

With his first ball against England, in his first Ashes Test, Warne produced a spectacular delivery that bowled Gatting out. It became recognised as being of considerable significance in not just the context of the match or series, but in cricket in general in that it signalled the revival of leg spin bowling. Background The pitch at Old Trafford traditionally favours spin bowling, and England picked two spin bowlers: Phil Tufnell and debutant Peter Such. In contrast, Australia picked three fast bowlers, with the inexperienced Warne as the only spinner. Warne had played in 11 Test matches up to that point, and taken 31 wickets at a moderate average of 30.80 runs per wicket. Although showing some promise, Warne's early career had been less than spectacular and his style of bowling ‚Äî leg spin ‚Äî was seen by many cricket followers as an antiquated art with little value in the modern game. Pace bowling had dominated the game since the legendary Australian pace bowlers of the 1970s. New Zealand‚Äôs captain and leading batsman, Martin Crowe, had praised Warne before the series, but Wisden notes that Crowe‚Äôs proclamation was widely dismissed as excusing New Zealand‚Äôs frailties rather than genuinely endorsing Warne. English captain Graham Gooch won the toss and elected to bowl first, hoping to use the pitch conditions to make batting difficult for the Australians. Despite Mark Taylor scoring a century, Australia were dismissed for a moderate total of 289 runs. England also began well, reaching 71 runs before Mike Atherton was dismissed by Merv Hughes. Opposite Gooch, Mike Gatting was the next man to bat and he duly set about scoring runs. At this point, Australian captain Allan Border turned to his leg spinner, Shane Warne. However, Gatting was renowned as a world-class player against spin bowling, and was fully expected to give the inexperienced Warne a tough time. Delivery A leg spin delivery. After a slow run-up of just a few paces, Warne rolled his right arm over and delivered a leg break to the right-handed Gatting. The ball initially travelled straight down the pitch towards the batsman. As is apparent from slow motion replays, the rapidly spinning cricket ball began to drift to the right (due to the Magnus effect). The ball ended up pitching several inches outside the line of Gatting's leg stump. Gatting responded by thrusting his left leg forward towards the pitch of the ball, and pushing his bat next to his pad, angled downwards. This was a standard defensive tactic used by most experienced batsmen against leg-spin balls which pitched outside leg stump. The intention is for the ball to hit either the pad or the bat without danger of being out. Because the ball pitched outside the leg stump, the batsman cannot be out leg before wicket, and if the ball spun slightly more than expected, it would hit the bat and rebound safely down to the ground so the batsman cannot be caught. However, the ball landed in a patch of the pitch which had been worn by the follow- through of pace bowlers earlier in the game (footmarks). This increased the friction between the ball and the surface, causing it to turn far more than Gatting (or anyone else) expected. The ball passed the outside edge of his bat, then clipped the top of his off stump, dislodging the bails. Gatting stared at the pitch for several seconds, before accepting that he was out bowled and walked off the field. The dismissal was captured in a photograph by Steve Lindsell, in which Gatting is in shock, while wicketkeeper Ian Healy raises his arms in celebration behind and Gatting's off bail spins somewhere above his head. Aftermath The fall of Gatting's wicket left England on 80 runs for 2 wickets, a position from which they never recovered, as Warne added the wicket of Robin Smith a mere four runs later. Warne also accounted for Gooch and Andy Caddick in the innings, helping reduce England to a first innings total of just 210. Encouraged by their bowling, Australia declared their second innings at 432 for 5 wickets. Warne then contributed four more wickets as Australia won the match by 179 runs, winning the man of the match award for his efforts. The result of this match set the tone for the remainder of the series, and Australia cruised to a comfortable 4-1 victory, with Warne taking a total of 34 wickets at an average of 25.79 and being named the Australian man of the series (each team being awarded a separate Man of the Series award by the other in that series). Legacy This series was another step in the early stages of a long domination of world cricket by Australia, coinciding with the exceedingly successful career of Warne. Warne's bowling also provided an eye-opening insight into the subtleties and power of leg spin bowling for modern cricket audiences, who had become used to the spectacle of pace attacks, and marked a worldwide resurgence of popularity in the art of spin bowling in general, and leg spin in particular. Warne's delivery to Gatting has become known as the Ball of the Century.The significance of the ball in a number of contexts, as well as the reaction from people who view video of its trajectory, have made the appellation stick. Since that incident, Warne has come to be acknowledged as one of the best bowlers in history. During the penultimate Test match of his career on Boxing Day 2006, in the fourth Ashes Test against England, Warne took his 700th Test wicket, bowling Andrew Strauss to become the first cricketer ever to reach this milestone. Graham Gooch commented on the reaction of Gatting, \\"He looked as though someone had just nicked his lunch\\", as Gatting was much mocked for his rotundity. This was further alluded to by journalist Martin Johnson, who said, \\"How anyone can spin a ball the width of Gatting boggles the mind\\", and again by Gooch who added, \\"If it had been a cheese roll, it would never have got past him.\\" During the Old Trafford Test of the 2005 Ashes series, the long- retired Gatting re-created the Ball Of The Century with an automated bowling machine programmed to deliver leg spin. In 2009 the Irish chamber pop group The Duckworth Lewis Method wrote a song called \\"Jiggery Pokery\\" about this incident. During the 2019 Cricket World Cup, India unorthodox bowler Kuldeep Yadav's dismissal of Pakistan's Babar Azam drew comparisons to Warne's ball, with James Gheerbrant of The Times calling the delivery \\"[Kuldeep's] own 'ball of the century'.\\" References External links *Sydney Morning Herald article on the top 25 moments in Australian cricket *Cricinfo article on the Top 50 Magic Moments in Cricket *Test Match Special Audio Archive: 'Live' Commentary of Warne's 'Ball of the Century' *Pavilion article on the Ball of the Century Category:Bowling (cricket) Category:History of Test cricket Category:The Ashes Category:1993 in English cricket ","title":"Ball of the Century"},{"id":"2429440","text":"Angus Oblong (born David Adam Walker on August 28, 1976) is an American writer and illustrator best known for his work Creepy Susie and 13 Other Tragic Tales for Troubled Children (1999) and the 2001 animated television series The Oblongs.

It features a 5-beat meter divided into \\"quick\\" (2-beat) and \\"slow\\" (3-beat) units, abbreviated quick-slow or 2-3. In Bulgaria it is part of the \\"Northern folklore region\\" time . Like many other Balkan folk dances, each region or village has its own version of the dance. It is traditionally a men's dance, but in modern times it is often performed in lines of both men and women. It is a line dance, with the dancers in a line facing left, holding hands. The dance starts moving right with a series of four lift-steps, followed by moving left: crossing the right foot in front of the left, transferring the weight onto the right foot while moving the left foot to the right (this is the characteristic movement of this dance, and is done four times). The dancers next move backwards using a series of four lift-steps. A number of variations can be seen among individual dancers. For example, instead of moving left with the right foot always crossing in front, a front and back pattern can be used, resulting in a basic grapevine step. When moving backwards, the lift steps can be replaced by scissor-steps, often ending with a pas-de-basque step. A common version of this dance is Yambolsko Paidushko Horo (yahm-bohl-sko pie-doosh-ko). The dance is known as the \\"Drunken Dance\\" in North Macedonia and is believed to have been brought to Turkey hundreds of years ago within the early stages of the Ottoman rule of Macedonia. The Pajdusko is still danced by many within Turkey, especially Turks of Macedonian ancestry.

The missile was first tested in 2005 and is widely believed to have entered service with the Pakistan Army in 2010, and the Pakistan Navy in 2018. Origin transporter erector launcher (TEL), carrying four cruise missiles, on display at the IDEAS 2008 defence exhibition, Karachi, Pakistan A transporter erector launcher (TEL) carrying four cruise missiles on display at the IDEAS 2008 defence exhibition in Karachi Pakistan claims to have developed the Babur in response to alleged reports that India was planning to acquire Patriot missiles from the US, in order to set up a ballistic missile defense system to counter Pakistan's arsenal of ballistic missiles. Babur is the first cruise missile to be developed and designed by Pakistan. Some analysts have pointed out similarities of the missile with Chinese and American designs, namely the DH-10 and Tomahawk. Former Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif claimed that Pakistani scientists reverse-engineered the American Tomahawk missile to make the Babur missile but his statement was rejected by Dr. Samar Mubarakmand who not only referred to US sources but also referred to the debris found in Balochistan as of no use. Design The Babur's airframe is made up of a tubular fuselage, with a pair of folded wings attached to the middle section and the empennage at the rear along with the propulsion system. Propelled by a jet engine (either turbofan or turbojet), the Babur has a maximum speed of approximately 550 mph. Launched from ground-based mobile transporter erector launchers (TELs), the Babur can be armed with both conventional and nuclear warheads and has a reported range of . On launch, a booster (rocketry) provides additional thrust to accelerate the missile away from the launch vehicle. After the launch the wings unfold, the booster rocket is jettisoned and the jet engine started. The missile is stated to have a high degree of maneuverability, allowing it to \\"hug\\" the terrain, and \\"near-stealth\\" capabilities. Terrain-hugging ability helps the missile avoid enemy radar detection by utilizing \\"terrain masking\\", giving Babur the capability to penetrate enemy air defence systems undetected. The Babur's guidance system uses a combination of inertial navigation systems (INS), terrain contour matching (TERCOM) and GPS satellite guidance. The guidance system reportedly gives the missile pinpoint accuracy. GPS access is not guaranteed under hostile conditions so the latest production models have also reportedly incorporated the Russian GLONASS. Future software and hardware updates could include the European Union's GALILEO and China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. An upgraded variant tested on the 14 December 2016 included upgraded avionics where now the missile is able to accurately hit land and sea based targets without the aid of GPS. Also the missile is able to hit targets more accurately. Operational history On August 12, 2005, Pakistan publicly announced that it had successfully test-fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile with a range of 500 km.Pakistan fires new cruise missile, BBC News, 11 August 2005 The missile was launched from a land-based transporter erector launcher (TEL). Pakistan did not notify India of its test-firing as the existing notification agreement is limited to ballistic missile testing only. On March 22, 2007, Pakistan test-fired an upgraded version of the Babur with an extended range of 700 km. On May 6, 2009, Pakistan conducted another test- firing but did not announce the event until 9 May 2009, citing political reasons. On October 28, 2011, Pakistan successfully test-fired its Babur cruise missile which has a range of 700 km. The ISPR said Babur was capable of carrying conventional and atomic warheads. A special feature of this launch was the validation of a new multi-tube missile launch vehicle (MLV) during the test. The three-tube MLV enhances manifold the targeting and deployment options in the conventional and nuclear modes. With its shoot-and-scoot capability, the MLV provides a major force multiplier effect for target employment and survivability. On June 6, 2012 Pakistan conducted a successful test-fire of the multi-tube, indigenously developed cruise missile Hatf-VII (Babur), which can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads with stealth capabilities. It was the third test-fire conducted by Pakistan in the recent past, of different capacity and load. ‚ÄúIt can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads and has stealth capabilities‚Äù, said an official announcement of the ISPR. ‚ÄúIt also incorporates the most modern cruise missile technology of Terrain Contour Matching (Tercom) and Digital Scene Matching and Area Co-relation (DSMAC), which enhances its precision and effectiveness manifolds.‚Äù A new variant of the missile, termed Babur-1B, was test fired on 14 April 2018. Pakistan conducted a successful launch of an enhanced version of the Babur II missile On December 14, 2016. Enhancements include upgraded aerodynamics and avionics where now the missile is able to accurately hit targets without the aid of GPS, and also target sea-based targets as well land based targets. On 9 January 2017, Pakistan conducted a successful launch of the Babur III missile from an underwater mobile platform. The Babur-III has a range of 450 km and can be used as a second-strike capability. It has been speculated that the missile is ultimately designed to be incorporated with the Agosta 90B class submarine which has been reported to have been modified. On 29 March 2018, Pakistan reported that the missile had again been successfully tested.  Claims by Ex-Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif  Speaking to reporters in London on bail granted due to Medical grounds, Ex-Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif claimed that Pakistan reversed engineered a Tomahawk missile after they found an intact one in Balochistan in 1998 from when ‚ÄúClinton dropped missiles in Afghanistan‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe got one, back engineered it and made it,‚Äù he said. However, nuclear physicist Samar Mubarakmand has rejected these claims, responding that, \\"a cruise missile is very sensitive. It‚Äôs not possible for the missile to have landed on the ground and not hit anything\\", he said. He also said that, \\"Pakistan did find a missile in Balochistan but it was in small pieces as it had exploded. It was a useless pile of rubbish, he said. The US didn‚Äôt ask for the remains of the missile, if it had we would have given it back\\". = Harbah = Harbah is an anti-ship and land-attack cruise missile under development by Pakistan. ISPR, media wing of the Pakistan Armed Forces, reported that the missile was test fired on 3 January 2018 from the PNS Himmat, an Azmat-class fast attack craft. The missile is believed to have been derived from Babur cruise missile. =See also= ;Related developments * Hatf-VIII (Ra'ad) ;Similar missiles * Tomahawk (missile) * CJ-10 (missile) * Hyunmoo-3 ;Related lists * List of missiles * List of missiles by country References External links * Jane's Information article on Hatf 7 (Babur) * Jane's Information article on Hatf 7 (Babur) * https://web.archive.org/web/20071213215008/http://www.pakmilitary.net/army/arsenal/cruise_missile.html Category:Science and technology in Pakistan Category:Cruise missiles of Pakistan Category:Cruise missiles Category:Anti-ship missiles Category:Anti- ship missiles of Pakistan Category:Guided missiles of Pakistan Category:Anti- ship cruise missiles Category:Anti-ship cruise missiles of Pakistan ","title":"Babur (cruise missile)"},{"id":"2429470","text":"Helen Layfield Bradley MBE (20 November 1900 ‚Äì 19 July 1979) was an English artist born in Lees, Lancashire, England.

Despite this, she did not begin to paint seriously until she was in her sixties. In the 1960s she met fellow painter L. S. Lowry who encouraged her in the creation of a narrative style based on her own childhood memories. From 1965 she became as popular in the United States as in the United Kingdom and her paintings now sell at auction for tens of thousands of pounds. Many of her paintings feature a character called \\"Miss Carter\\", a woman who always wore pink. In 1971 Jonathan Cape published the first of four books And Miss Carter Wore Pink: Scenes from an Edwardian Childhood, which was an instant success. Editions were then published in German, French, Dutch and Japanese, and a special edition produced for the US. The series, illustrated with Bradley's naive paintings, topped the bestseller lists in the early 1970s. Bradley appeared on a number of television chat shows of the 1970s, including Pebble Mill at One and the Russell Harty Show. In July 1975 she was a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. The BBC and the NBC network made documentaries about her life and the Northern Ballet adapted her work for the stage, with live narration by actress Pat Phoenix. In the 1978 Birthday Honours she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), but died at her home, 2 Green Villa Park, Wilmslow, Cheshire, on 19 July 1979, before her investiture. Her works are in several public collections, including those of the Yale Center for British Art, Salford Museum and Art Gallery, and the Saddleworth Museum, with several at Gallery Oldham. The gallery also has a bust of Oldham. Her portrait in oils, painted circa 1975 by C. Harrison, is in a private collection. In May 2013 Bradley's Going for a Walk Before Bedtime sold at auction, at Bonhams of London, for ¬£37,250. Two of her paintings, one in oil and one in watercolour, featured in an October 2019 episode of the BBC Television programme Antiques Roadshow.

TeleRadyo would return simulcasting the newscast on May 8, 2020. TV Patrol was supposed to simulcast on Kapamilya Channel, the network's ad interim replacement to ABS-CBN for cable and satellite providers beginning June 15, 2020, but the newscast was instead excluded from its programming schedule when the channel was launched on June 13, 2020. It was instead replaced by a 30-minute edition of the network's hourly newsbreak News Patrol beginning Monday June 15, with 6:00 ·¥ò.·¥ç. to 6:30 ·¥ò.·¥ç. broadcast time. According to Atienza and Fullido, the newscast was excluded from the Kapamilya Channel because the newscast is already broadcasting on ANC, other digital channels, and social media platforms. On the same day, TV Patrol was shortened to an airtime of 90 to 110 minutes, giving way for the aforementioned airing of News Patrol and the simulcast of FPJ's Ang Probinsyano on Cine Mo! and Kapamilya Channel. The decision, however, would be later reversed giving way for the newscast to be aired on Kapamilya Channel beginning July 27. Failon's departure On August 30, 2020, it was announced by ABS-CBN Corporation that Ted Failon would be leaving the network as part of the network's retrenchment program. His final appearance was on August 31, appearing via Zoom Video Communications with Alvin Elchico filling in for Failon on the day's episode. From September 1 to 4, 2020, Elchico and Zen Hernandez along with Jorge Cari√±o served as interim anchors until September 7 when both de Castro and Sembrano returned. On the following day, the opening billboard was updated to reflect Failon's departure. From September 7 to October 2, former anchors include Julius Babao, Karen Davila and Henry Omaga- Diaz, and TV Patrol Weekend anchors occasionally appeared as third anchor on weeknight edition, as Failon's replacement was still unknown until the announcement on October 4. =2020‚Äìpresent: Noli de Castro, Bernadette Sembrano, and Henry Omaga-Diaz= On September 30, 2020, Davila announced on her Instagram account that former anchor Henry Omaga-Diaz (which served from 2001 to 2003 and from 2004 to 2006 as weekend anchor) will replace Failon beginning on October 5, which ABS-CBN confirmed this on October 4. On that day, the current OBB that was used since 2016 returned, but with Omaga-Diaz replacing Failon on the said billboard while the rest remain unchanged. TV Patrol Weekend Initially aired during special occasions since its inception, the weekend editions premiered on May 9, 2004 at 6:30 ·¥ò.·¥ç. and May 15, 2004 at 7:30 ·¥ò.·¥ç. as TV Patrol Sabado and TV Patrol Linggo, respectively, with Ces Ore√±a-Dril√≥n and Henry Omaga-D√≠az as its first anchors. At the beginning both editions were complemented by The Weekend News as ABS-CBN's weekend newscasts with TV Patrol Sabado and TV Patrol Linggo as the early-evening newscast and The Weekend News as the late-night newscast until the latter was canceled three years later.

Beginning March 21, 2020, the program expanded to 45 minutes in weekends, and on March 28 began airing on both DZMM TeleRadyo and the ABS-CBN News Channel for the first time in 16 years (Sundays only, with program beginning a Saturday broadcast on ANC beginning April 25 that same year). The broadcast's return to DZMM TeleRadyo was the first to be aired there after seven years of absence. On May 9, 2020, the weekend edition began to be aired in Cine Mo! after the expiration of its franchise, while on TeleRadyo it began to broadcast on Saturdays. The newscast also extended its broadcast time to 50 minutes, and later on to a full hour. It airs Saturdays and Sundays at 6:00 to 7:00 ·¥ò.·¥ç.

Theme music TV Patrol originally used Vangelis's \\"Pulstar\\" as its very first theme music, from March 2, 1987 to November 4, 1994. On November 7, 1994, \\"Pulstar\\" was replaced by Ryan Cayabyab's \\"ABS-CBN News Theme,\\" which served as the theme of TV Patrol and the ABS-CBN News and Public Affairs division until 1996. The theme is currently used as a theme music for The World Tonight which was moved to ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC) in 1999, with slight and more modern recomposition. In 1996, when Noli de Castro became the sole anchor of the newscast, it adopted Gari Communications' \\"Allegro\\" from KPIX-TV, a CBS- owned TV station in San Francisco, California. Although, the news theme had also been used by KBAK-TV, a former ABC and currently a CBS affiliate in Bakersfield, California until 1997. On March 12, 2001, when de Castro left the show for the elections and Korina Sanchez, Henry Omaga Diaz and Aljo Bendijo replaced him as the new anchors, the Filipino composition of Allegro was done with elements from the orchestra version and combines the elements of the original 1996‚Äì2001 version, the 1994‚Äì96 ABS-CBN News Theme, and the ABS-CBN's jingle. The theme underwent re-compositions in 2002, which was also used by TV Patrol Sabado/Linggo from 2004 to 2006, 2004, and 2006, which was rearranged and composed by Neocolours's Jimmy Antiporda. The theme music from June 30, 2010 to present, which incorporates the elements of \\"Pulstar,\\" TV Patrol's 2001 theme, and TV Patrol World's 2004 and 2006 theme music.

All regional editions aired in the late afternoon until ABS-CBN ceased free TV and radio operations on May 5, 2020, with selected editions simulcast over The Filipino Channel for overseas viewers. Several newscasts were also aired nationwide from August 2016 to January 2018 on the ABS-CBN Regional Channel via Sky Cable, Destiny Cable, and Sky Direct. The ABS-CBN Regional YouTube page also includes archived videos of past editions for those who have not watched the program as well as for overseas viewers. On May 8, 2020, the regional editions resumed broadcasts through their respective Facebook pages and the ABS-CBN Regional YouTube channel. However, on July 15, 2020, ABS-CBN announced that the company will go into retrenchment on August 31 in light of the denial of its bid for a legislative franchise, laying-off much of its employees. It was further revealed on July 17, 2020, during an interview on Failon Ngayon sa TeleRadyo that the regional division of ABS-CBN News will fold after regular business hours on the said retrenchment date. Included in the shutdown is the halt of all its regional programs and their respective TV Patrol editions with their last broadcasts aired on August 28, 2020. =Final editions= Luzon *TV Patrol Bicol (1996-2020) *TV Patrol North Luzon (1991-2020) *TV Patrol Palawan (1997-2006; 2012-2020) *TV Patrol Southern Tagalog (2009-2020) Visayas *TV Patrol Central Visayas (1988-2020) *TV Patrol Eastern Visayas (1997-2020) *TV Patrol Negros (1989-2020) *TV Patrol Panay (2001-2020) Mindanao *TV Patrol Chavacano (1994-2020) *TV Patrol North Mindanao (1995-2020) *TV Patrol South Central Mindanao (1996-2020) *TV Patrol Southern Mindanao (1989-2020) =Defunct editions= *TV Patrol Cagayan de Oro/Iligan/Nuebe Patrol (relaunched as TV Patrol Northern Mindanao then TV Patrol North Mindanao) *TV Patrol Naga/Legazpi (merged into TV Patrol Bicol) *TV Patrol Cebu/Dumaguete (merged into TV Patrol Central Visayas) *TV Patrol Tuguegarao/Isabela (merged into TV Patrol Cagayan Valley, later merged with TV Patrol North Luzon) *TV Patrol Baguio (relaunched asTV Patrol Northern Luzon, later TV Patrol North Luzon) *TV Patrol Laoag (relaunched as TV Patrol Ilocos, later merged with TV Patrol North Luzon) *TV Patrol Iloilo (relaunched as TV Patrol Panay) *TV Patrol 4 (renamed as TV Patrol Western Visayas, then TV Patrol Bacolod, until renamed TV Patrol Negros) *TV Patrol Western Visayas (now comprising TV Patrol Negros and TV Patrol Panay) *TV Patrol Butuan (relaunched as TV Patrol Caraga, later merged to TV Patrol North Mindanao) *TV Patrol Mindanao (scaled down as TV Patrol Davao, then reverted to its original title, until renamed TV Patrol Southern Mindanao) *TV Patrol Dagupan (relaunched as TV Patrol North Central Luzon, later merged with TV Patrol North Luzon) *Palawan TV Patrol (relaunched as TV Patrol Palawan) *TV Patrol Zamboanga (relaunched as TV Patrol Chavacano) *TV Patrol Cotabato (relaunched as TV Patrol Central Mindanao, later merged to TV Patrol South Central Mindanao) *TV Patrol General Santos (relaunched as TV Patrol Socsksargen and later as TV Patrol South Central Mindanao) *TV Patrol Pagadian (relaunched as TV Patrol Northwestern Mindanao, then replaced by Nuebe Patrol and later merged to TV Patrol North Mindanao) *TV Patrol Pampanga (axed in 2018; scaled down to short News Patrol Kapampangan bulletin opt-outs, later merged with TV Patrol North Luzon) *TV Patrol Tacloban (fused into TV Patrol Eastern Visayas) International broadcast TV Patrol Weekend airs in Australia with a delayed telecast the next morning on SBS's World Watch at 8:05·¥ò.·¥ç. and every Sunday and Monday on SBS/SBSHD, with replays at 2:30PM on SBS Viceland, while TV Patrol is aired every Tuesday to Saturday.

Reception In 1989, poet and literary critic Virgilio S. Almario was critical of TV Patrol's use of Filipino \\"siyokoy\\" words, loanwords from the Spanish or English language that are formed through a misunderstanding of Spanish grammar. As examples, Almario highlighted the use of the words \\"aspeto,\\" \\"parliyamento,\\" \\"pesante,\\" and \\"konsernado,\\" which he respectively corrected as \\"aspekto,\\" \\"parlamento,\\" \\"magsasaka,\\" \\"paisano\\" or \\"magbubukid,\\" and \\"konsernido.\\" However, he still commends the program for \\"passionately\\" delivering news in the Filipino language. Accolades The national TV Patrol and its anchors and reporters throughout the two decades of broadcast got various local, national, and even international recognitions, such as the Asian TV Awards, New York Festivals, and the International Emmy Awards, as reported in the ABS-CBN Corporate Annual Reports. On its 1987 launch, TV Patrol got a winning nod from the 1st Star Awards for Television formed by the Philippine Movie Press Club (PMPC). Main anchor Noli de Castro won the Best Male News Anchor that year. The provincial editions of TV Patrol Regional and their respective news teams also got notable local and national recognitions (including from KBP Golden Dove Awards and Catholic Mass Media Awards.) Among the award-winning provincial editions and regional news teams hail from TV Patrol North Luzon, TV Patrol Palawan, TV Patrol Panay, TV Patrol Negros, TV Patrol Central Visayas, TV Patrol Eastern Visayas, TV Patrol South Central Mindanao and TV Patrol Southern Mindanao.

The soil is dark and fertile and the area around Blackfen Road and Wellington Avenue is prone to flooding in extreme conditions. The housing stock is almost exclusively owner-occupied houses of conventional British design. The sale of the Danson Estate in 1922 marked the beginning of a major period of house building in the area and most of the houses date from the 1930s. Local services =Churches= The Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Rosary near the top end of Burnt Oak Lane was built in 1936. Originally part of the parish of St Stephen's, Welling, it became a parish Church in its own right in 1945. The Anglican Church of the Holy Redeemer in Days Lane, dedicated on 21 October 1933, is built entirely of steel and concrete. The architect was A.S.R. Ley. The Church describes itself as a \\"forward-looking, average Anglican congregation\\". The Good Shepherd Church on Blackfen Road is part of the parish of Holy Redeemer. =Pubs= At the junction of Blackfen Road and Westwood Lane, is the George Staples (formerly known as The Woodman). The original Woodman pub dates from 1845; the present building was completed in 1931. The pub has undergone several changes of character, including being promoted as a \\"Sports Bar\\". The new landlords have transformed the pub into the George Staples in order to counter the increasingly bad reputation The Woodman had developed. It is now being promoted as a family friendly pub. Planning permission is currently underway to develop the area to the front of the George Staples in order to provide a better beer garden-style environment for use in the summer months. Half a mile west along the Blackfen Road, on the south side is the \\"Jolly Fenman\\", built in the 1950s. The Fenman was refurbished in February 2006 and again in 2017 and it offers table service for meals. For about 4 years in the mid 1980s this pub had its own in-house brewery. Just north towards Welling, in Westwood Lane, Bexley Borough's 3rd Micropub opened in spring 2015 called The Broken Drum (named after an inn in one of Terry Pratchett's novels). It has subsequently been awarded the prestigious SPBW London Pub of the Year 2018 award. =Library= The Blackfen Library moved from Cedar Avenue to newly refurbished premises on Blackfen Road in March 2005. There was some local controversy because of the character of the old library building and uncertainty as to whether the premises would be put to any use. In April 2016 Bexley Council handed over control of Blackfen Library to the New Generation Church Trust, and Blackfen Library became Blackfen Community Library. =Shopping= There are two principal shopping parades, on Blackfen Road and at The Oval. At the Oval, there are three restaurants and a number of other small shops and businesses. The crescent- shaped parade of shops includes flats above and fronts an oval-shaped unfenced public garden with paths, flower beds and ornamental trees. Both the parade, with Tudoresque details to the frontage, and this small municipal garden are included in a designated Conservation Area. Underneath the public garden is a large World War II air-raid shelter. The larger shopping centre of Blackfen lacks greenery or architectural finesse, but includes a large foodstore (Co- op) with free parking space next to a prominent flyover that carries the modern A2 Trunk Road. The Blackfen Road shops include a post office, several car sales showrooms and many small local businesses including caf√©s and fast food outlets, jewellers, clothing shops, hairdressers, building suppliers, cycle store and an independent funeral director. It benefits from direct bus links to larger shopping centres at Bexleyheath, Eltham, Sidcup, Welling and Woolwich. =Greenery= The River Shuttle flows eastward through Blackfen; along the river in this area are four parks/open spaces. In the order they appear on the course of the river, they are: Parish Wood, Holly Oak Wood Park, Willersley Park, and Marlborough Park. Wyncham Stream flowing north joins the River Shuttle at Holly Oak Wood Park; there is a small wood on this stream called Beverley Wood. Education :For education in Blackfen see the main London Borough of Bexley article Blackfen School for Girls is at the eastern end of Blackfen Road. Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School is in Holbeach Gardens. Days Lane Primary School is the largest primary school in the borough of Bexley and has approximately 650 children on its role. Sherwood Park Primary School is located off Sherwood Park Avenue and Ramillies Road. The University of Greenwich Avery Hill Campus is located less than 1 mile to the West of the area. Transport Blackfen is served by Transport for London bus routes 51 to Woolwich via Welling and Orpington via Sidcup, 132 to North Greenwich via Eltham and to Bexleyheath, and B13 to New Eltham and Bexleyheath. The nearest National Rail stations are Sidcup and Welling. Nearby Areas Blackfen borders Welling to the north west, north and north east, Blendon to the east and south east, Sidcup to the south and Avery Hill to the south west and west.

Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain (15 April 1707 ‚Äì 15 January 1778), French general, was born on 15 April 1707, at the Ch√¢teau of Vertamboz. Educated at Jesuit schools, he intended to enter the priesthood, but at the last minute obtained from Louis XV an appointment as sub-lieutenant. He left France, according to the gossip of the time, because of a duel; served under the Elector Palatine; fought for Hungary against the Turks, and on the outbreak of the war of the Austrian Succession (1740) joined the army of the elector of Bavaria (who later became emperor under the name of Charles VII), displaying such bravery that he was promoted to the grade of lieutenant field-marshal. He left Bavaria on the death of Charles VII, and after brief service under Frederick the Great joined Marshal Saxe in the Netherlands and was created a field-marshal of the French army. He distinguished himself especially at Lauffeld, Rocoux and Maastricht. On the outbreak of the Seven Years' War (1756) he was appointed lieutenant-general, and although he showed greater ability than any of his fellow-commanders and was admired by his soldiers, he fell a victim to court intrigues, professional jealousy and hostile criticism. He resigned his commission in 1760 and accepted an appointment as field-marshal from Frederick V of Denmark, being charged in 1762 with the reorganization of the Danish army. In 1767, he and his circle, wished to make Birgitte Sofie Gabel the official mistress of Christian VII of Denmark in order to divert him from politics and take over the de facto power over the government themselves.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. The plan failed because Gabel did not wish to become the king's mistress, as she found him repulsive and was in love with Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, and the same year, St√∏vlet-Cathrine became the king's official mistress instead. He soon returned to France, bought a small estate in Alsace near Lauterbach (close to Mulhouse), and devoted his time to religion and farming. A financial crisis swept away the funds that he had saved from his Danish service and rendered him dependent on the bounty of the French ministry of war. Saint-Germain was presented at court by the reformers Turgot and Malesherbes, and was appointed minister of war by Louis XVI on 25 October 1775. He sought to lessen the number of officers and to establish order and regularity in the service. His efforts to introduce Prussian discipline in the French army brought on such opposition that he resigned in September 1777. He accepted quarters from the king and a pension of 40,000 livres, and died in his apartment at the Arsenal of Paris on 15 January 1778.

This means that standard SDI infrastructure can be used. Developed to address the needs of the growing number of compressed video standards (DV, DVCPRO, BetaSX, MPEG2) it allows lossless transfer of data to other devices which have the same codec, for example DV to DV or SX to SX. Using a standard SDI transport, the extra data is placed within normal active video, between Start of Active Video (SAV), and End of Active Video (EAV). This gives 1440 10bit words of data at 270Mbit/s (1920 words in the 8bit 360Mbit/s standard). If an SDTI stream is viewed using a standard SDI device, then the raw data can be seen as a small strip along the left hand side (usually in purple). The DVCAM SDTI has video data at the top, control data in the middle (Timecode, etc.) and audio at the bottom just like it is organised on the tape. Because SDTI is used for compressed data the area used is less than a full screen; this allows for faster than realtime transfers. SDTI is standardized as SMPTE 305M.

On August 12, 1973, University of Tennessee biologist and professor David Etnier discovered the snail darter in the Little Tennessee River while doing research related to a lawsuit under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The lawsuit said that the Tellico Reservoir, to be created by Tellico Dam, would alter the habitat of the river to the point of killing off the endangered snail darter. The NEPA lawsuits slowed the construction of the Tellico Dam but did not stop it. After the Supreme Court upheld protection under NEPA, Congress passed legislation specifically exempting the snail darter from protection; the dam project and inundation of the reservoir were completed in 1979. US Supreme Court decision The United States Congress had been inconsistent regarding the snail darter and the Endangered Species Act. Appropriations committees in both the House and Senate had taken a strong position against stopping the dam and reservoir project in order to protect the snail darter. A 1977 Senate Appropriations Committee report stated: > This committee has not viewed the Endangered Species Act as preventing the > completion and use of these projects which were well under way at the time > the affected species were listed as endangered. If the act has such an > effect, which is contrary to the Committee's understanding of the intent of > Congress in enacting the Endangered Species Act, funds should be > appropriated to allow these projects to be completed and their benefits > realized in the public interest, the Endangered Species Act not > withstanding. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978), Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for the majority. The court replied to the Tennessee Valley Authority's arguments and expanded on its decision:Supreme Court Decision: TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978) *The language of the Act made no exceptions for projects like Tellico that were well under way when Congress passed the act. *It is clear from the Act's legislative history that Congress intended to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction. The pointed omission of the type of qualified language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious congressional design to give endangered species priority over the \\"primary missions\\" of federal agencies. Congress, moreover, foresaw that on occasion this would require agencies to alter ongoing projects in order to fulfill the Act's goals. *Though statements in Appropriations Committee Reports expressed the view of the Committees either that the Act did not apply to Tellico or that the dam should be completed regardless of the Act's provisions, nothing in the TVA appropriations measures passed by Congress said that the Tellico project was to be completed regardless of the Act's requirements. When voting on appropriations measures, legislators are entitled to assume that the funds will be devoted to purposes that are lawful and not for any purpose forbidden. A contrary policy would violate the rules of both Houses of Congress, which provide that appropriations measures may not change existing substantive law. An appropriations committee's expression does not operate to repeal or modify substantive legislation. *Completion of the Tellico Dam project would violate the Act, so the Court of Appeals did not err by ordering the project to be enjoined. Congress has spoken in the plainest words, making it clear that endangered species are to be accorded the highest priorities. Since that legislative power has been exercised, it is up to the executive branch to administer the law and for the Judiciary to enforce it when, as here, enforcement has been sought. Burger's opinion emphasized that, as written, the Endangered Species Act explicitly forbade the completion of such projects as Tellico if the Secretary of Interior had determined that such a project would likely result in the elimination of a species. Although more than $100 million had been spent on the project by 1978, and the dam was substantially finished, the court could not allow the TVA to finish the project. According to Burger, this would force the court \\"to ignore the ordinary meaning of plain language.\\" Supporters of the dam project, who believed that it would serve a much larger public good than protection of the snail darter, reacted in an effort to rework the Endangered Species Act. In his book The Fishes of Tennessee' David Etnier later wrote: \\"the snail darter had become almost a household word, and in current usage 'snail darter types' is approximately synonymous with 'ultra-liberal environmental activists.'\\"Etnier, David A. and Wayne C. Starnes. The Fishes of Tennessee. Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press, 1993. Two Tennessee legislators get involved Congressman John Duncan, Sr., whose district included Tellico, and Senator Howard Baker. Duncan had been a long-time congressional supporter of the project. On the other hand, Baker had not taken a position before. Howard Baker was a leading sponsor of an amendment to the Endangered Species Act that was passed into law in November 1978. The idea was to create a mechanism whereby a specific project could be excluded from the Endangered Species Act. If a controversy arose, the amendment called for the creation of a special committee consisting of various Cabinet level members and at least one member from the affected state where the project in question was located. It came to be known as the \\"God Committee\\" because if they exercised their power to exempt a project from the act, they were in effect acting like God and allowing destruction of an entire species. There was a fear by project supporters in Congress that many projects in the country would be affected by litigation as biologists might set out to discover obscure species, including insects or even micro-biotic life forms. The proponents of the \\"God Committee\\" amendment believed it could be a means to protect the Endangered Species Act. According to the Burger opinion, U.S. endangered species laws at that time \\"represented the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation\\". But, instead of granting Tellico an exemption from the Endangered Species Act, the committee voted unanimously in favor of the snail darter, largely finding that the dam project had poor economic issues. On January 23, 1979, the Committee unanimously denied an exemption for Tellico, specifically on economic grounds, rather than ecological grounds. \\"I hate to see the snail darter get the credit for stopping a project that was ill-conceived and uneconomic in the first place,\\" said Chairman Andrus. The reservoir project deserved to be killed on its own merits. As Charles Schultze, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors and a member of the Committee, said, \\"Here is a project that is 95% complete, and if one takes the cost of finishing it against the total project benefits, and does it properly, it doesn't pay, which says something about the original design.\\" Zygmunt J. B. Plater, \\"Reflected in a River: Agency Accountability and the TVA Tellico Dam Case\\", Tennessee Law Review, Summer 1992, Volume 49, Number 4, 754. The opposition made much of the problematic benefit-cost issue throughout the 1970s. Despite his credentials as one of the nation's top economists, however, Schultze was no more prepared to accurately predict future benefits than anyone else at the time. Wheeler and McDonald state the problem was TVA's general unfamiliarity with the econometric models used to come up with benefit-cost ratios.William Bruce Wheeler and Michael J. McDonald, TVA and the Tellico Dam 1936-1979: A Bureaucratic Crisis in Post- Industrial America (Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press, 1986) Such models require some underlying assumptions. Wheeler and McDonald identified five general assumptions which TVA used and declared them all to be false. They were: (1) The Tellico area would remain economically static without the project. (2) All economic projects that occurred in the area after completion of the project should be attributed to the project. (3) If an economic benefit could take place at Tellico, then it would. (4) The Tellico Project would not detract from any economic benefits already being enjoyed in the area. (5) Once set, costs would not rise faster than the normal annual inflation rate of the early 1960s. Congress had updated and strengthened the Endangered Species Act in 1973. Tellico Dam opponents had successfully sued under the provisions of that law to stop the dam. The Supreme Court had stated that as written, it was clear that Congress intended to protect all species, including the snail darter. In 1978 Congress amended the law, with the case of the snail darter specifically in mind. Baker drafted an amendment to the Endangered Species Act that excluded the Tellico project. He attempted to satisfy arguments of the federal courts. Duncan gained passage of the amendment by the House on June 18, 1979, on a voice vote. The vote became infamous among dam opponents. Baker introduced the amendment in the Senate on July 17 and was defeated on a vote of 45-53. Undeterred, Baker reintroduced the amendment in September. Baker spoke in favor of his amendment on the Senate floor: Completion of dam On September 10, 1979, Baker's amendment passed on a vote of 48 to 44. 28 Republicans and 20 Democrats supported it. 10 Republicans and 34 Democrats opposed it. On September 25, 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed the bill that exempted the Tellico Dam from the Endangered Species Act. On November 29, 1979, with retired TVA Chairman Red Wagner watching, the TVA closed the gates on the Tellico Dam to begin inundation of the Tellico Reservoir. Before this action, numerous snail darters were transplanted into the Hiwassee River in Tennessee. The snail darter was reclassified from endangered to threatened on July 5, 1984.

Eik√æyrnir (Old Norse \\"oak-thorny\\"Orchard (1997:36).), or Eikthyrnir, is a stag which stands upon Valhalla in Norse mythology. The following is related in the Gylfaginning section of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda after the description of Hei√∞r√∫n. {  Enn er meira mark at of hj√∂rtinn Eir√æyrni, [sic]variants: Eir√æyrni [R], Eik√æyrni [W], Eik√æyrra [T], Tak√æyrni [U] er stendr √° Valh√∂ll ok b√≠tr af limum √æess tr√©s, en af hornum ver√∞r sv√° mikill dropi at ni√∞r kemr √≠ Hvergelmi, en √æa√∞an af falla √°r √æ√¶r er sv√° heita: S√≠√∞, V√≠√∞, Sekin, Ekin, Sv√∂l, Gunn√ær√≥, Fj√∂rm, Fimbul√æul, Gipul, G√∂pul, G√∂mul, Geirvimul, √æessar falla um √°sabyg√∞ir. √ûessar eru enn nefndar: √ûyn, Vin, √û√∂ll, B√∂ll, Gr√°√∞, Gunn√ær√°in, Nyt, N√∂t, N√∂nn, Hr√∂nn, V√≠na, Veg, Svinn, √ûj√≥√∞numa. -- (ch. 39; Normalized text of the R manuscript)  Even more worthy of note is the hart Eikthyrni, which stands in Valhall and bites from the limbs of the tree; and from his horns distils such abundant exudation that it comes down into Hvergelmir, and from thence fall those rivers called thus: S√≠d, V√≠d, S√∏kin, Eikin, Sv√∂l, Gunnthr√°, Fj√∂rm, Fimbulthul, G√≠pul, G√∂pul, G√∂mul, Geirvimul.

The more recent translation by Anthony Faulkes puts the stag on top of the building, which seems much more natural from the context and weight of the evidence. Snorri's source for this information was almost certainly Gr√≠mnism√°l, where the following strophes are found. {  :Eik√æyrnir heitir hi√∂rtr, :er stendr √° h√∂llo Heriaf√∂√∞rs :ok b√≠tr af L√¶ra√∞s limom; :en af hans hornom :dr√Ωpr i Hvergelmi, :√æa√∞an eigo v√∂tn √∂ll vega: :S√≠√∞ ok V√≠√∞, :S√¶kin ok Eikin, :Sv√∂l ok Gunn√ær√≥, :Fi√∂rm ok Fimbul√æul, :R√≠n ok Rennandi, :Gipul ok G√∂pul, :G√∂mul ok Geirvimul, :√æ√¶r hverfa um hodd go√∞a, :√ûyn ok Vin, :√û√∂ll ok H√∂ll, :Gr√°√∞ ok Gunn√æorin. :V√≠na heitir enn, :√∂nnor Vegsvinn, :√æri√∞ia √ûi√≥√∞numa, :Nyt ok N√∂t, :N√∂nn ok Hr√∂nn, :Sl√≠√∞ ok Hri√∞, :Sylgr ok Ylgr, :V√≠√∞ ok V√°n, :V√∂nd ok Str√∂nd, :Gi√∂ll ok Leiptr, :√æ√¶r falla gumnom n√¶r, :en falla til heilar he√∞an. -- J√≥n Helgason's edition  :Eikthyrnir the hart is called, :that stands o‚Äôer Odin‚Äôs hall, :and bits from L√¶rad‚Äôs branches; :from his horns fall :drops into Hvergelmir, :whence all waters rise:- :Sid and Vid, :Soekin and Eikin, :Sv√∂l and Gunntro, :Fi√∂rm and Fimbulthul, :Rin and Rennandi, :Gipul and G√∂pul, :G√∂mul and Geirvimul: :they round the gods‚Äô dwellings wind. :Thyn and Vin, :Th√∂ll and H√∂ll, :Grad and Gunnthorin. :Vina one is called, :a second Vegsvin, :a third Thiodnuma; :Nyt and N√∂t, :N√∂n and Hr√∂n, :Slid and Hrid, :Sylg and Ylg, :Vid and Van, :V√∂nd and Str√∂nd, :Gi√∂ll and Leipt; :these (two) fall near to men, :but fall hence to Hel. -- Thorpe's translation  } Etymology The etymology of Eik√æyrnir remains debatable. Anatoly Liberman suggests that Hei√∞√æyrnir, the name of the lowest heaven in Scandinavian mythology (from hei√∞ \\"bright sky\\"), was cut into two, and on the basis of those halves the names of the heavenly stag Eik√æyrnir and the heavenly goat Hei√∞r√∫n were formed. The origin of -√æyrnir is not entirety clear, but the associations with thorns is, most probably, due to folk etymology.Liberman (2016:345‚Äì346).

Life He was born at Amboise, into a family from the lesser nobility of central France. As his father wished, he tried first law and then the army as a profession. While in the garrison at Bordeaux, he came under the influence of Martinez de Pasqually, usually called a Portuguese Jew (although later research has revealed the probability that he was a Spanish Catholic), who taught a species of mysticism drawn from cabbalistic sources, and endeavoured to found thereon a secret cult with magical or theurgical rites. Around September 1768 Saint-Martin was introduced to the Elect Co√´ns. From 1768 until 1771, Saint-Martin worked at Bordeaux as secretary to Martinez de Pasqually. In 1771, Saint-Martin left the army to become a preacher of mysticism. Same year he was living with Jean-Baptiste Willermoz at Lyon, while writing his first book. His conversational powers made him welcome in Parisian salons; but his zeal led him to England, where he made the acquaintance of William Law, the English mystic, and to Italy and Switzerland, as well as to the chief towns of France. In February 1784, Saint-Martin joined Society of Harmony in Paris. In 1787, he met William Law on a trip to London. From 1788 until 1791 he resided at Strasbourg, where he met Baron Karl G√∂ran Silfverhjelm, the nephew of Emanuel Swedenborg. At Strasbourg, in 1788, he met Charlotte de Boecklin, who introduced him to the writings of Jakob B√∂hme. In July 1790, he resigned from Rectified Scottish Rite and asked Jean-Baptiste Willermoz for his name to be removed from all Masonic registers. In 1792, Saint-Martin began corresponding with the Swiss theosopher Niklaus Anton Kirchberger von Liebisdorf. A nobleman, he was interned and his property was confiscated during the French Revolution. He was later freed by local officials, who wanted him to become a school teacher. He was brought up a strict Catholic, and always remained attached to the Church, although his first work, Of Errors and Truth, was placed upon the Index. He died at Aulnay (now Ch√¢tenay-Malabry), from October 13 to October 14, 1803.http://www.iapsop.com/ssoc/1901__waite___life_of_louis_claude_de_saint- martin.pdf Works He was the first to translate the writings of Jakob B√∂hme from German into French. His later years were devoted almost entirely to the composition of his chief works and to the translation of B√∂hme. His published letters show that he was interested in spiritualism, magnetic treatments, magical evocation and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg. His chief works are Lettre √† un ami, ou Consid√©rations philosophiques et religieuses sur la r√©volution fran√ßaise (Letter to a Friend, or Philosophical and Religious Considerations on the French Revolution), √âclair sur l'Association humaine, L'Esprit des choses ou Coup d'≈ìil philosophique sur la nature des √™tres et sur l'objet de leur existence and Le Minist√®re de l'Homme-Esprit. Other treatises appeared in his ≈íuvres posthumes (1807). Saint-Martin regarded the French Revolution as a sermon in action, if not indeed a miniature of the last judgment. His ideal society was a natural and spiritual theocracy, in which God would raise up men of mark and endowment, who would regard themselves strictly as divine commissioners to guide the people. All ecclesiastical organization was to disappear, giving place to a purely spiritual Christianity, based on the assertion of a faculty superior to the reason moral sense, from which we derive knowledge of God. God exists as an eternal personality, and the creation is an overflowing of the divine love, which was unable to contain itself. The human soul, the human intellect or spirit, the spirit of the universe and the elements or matter, are the four stages of this divine emanation, man being the immediate reflection of God, and nature in turn a reflection of man. Man, however, has fallen from his high estate, and matter is one of the consequences of his fall. But divine love, united to humanity in Christ, will work the final regeneration. Influence Admirers of his works formed groups of Friends of St. Martin, which later became known as Martinists. They were influential on the formation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.CORE SPIRIT, Translation of the work of Jakob B√∂hme et Le Philosophe Inconnu, by Louis-claude de Saint-Martin, 1775 Lyon, France References ;Attribution * External links * Louis Claude de Saint- Martin * Detailed biography (Eleazar Institute) * ‚ÄúThe Mystery of Truth: Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin‚Äôs Enlightened Mysticism,‚Äù Journal of the History of Ideas 61:4 (October 2000): 623-655 Category:1743 births Category:1803 deaths Category:People from Amboise Category:18th-century Christian mystics Category:19th-century Christian mystics Category:Martinism Category:French philosophers Category:Roman Catholic mystics Category:French male non-fiction writers Category:18th-century occultists ","title":"Louis Claude de Saint-Martin"},{"id":"2429536","text":"Victor Clement Georges Philippe Loret (1 September 1859 - 3 February 1946) was a French Egyptologist.

The JetTrain was an experimental high-speed passenger train concept created by Bombardier Transportation in an attempt to make European-style high-speed service more financially appealing to passenger railways throughout North America. It was designed to use the same LRC-derived tilting carriages as the Acela Express trains that Bombardier built for Amtrak in the 1990s, which used all-electric locomotives. Unlike the Acela, powered electrically by overhead lines, the JetTrain would have used a combination of a gas-turbine engine, a low-power diesel engine, a reduction gearbox, and two alternators to power electric traction motors. This would have allowed it to run at high speeds on non- electrified lines.  Description  = Gas turbine engines = Turbine engines use as much as 65% of their overall generated power to run the compressor at the front of the engine. This means that when the engine is set to idle, with no net energy output, the engine is still burning 65% of the fuel it would at full speed. This makes turbine engines attractive only in roles where they are run at high power settings for long periods of time, as is the case in aircraft, power generation, or long-range train service. They are generally unattractive in roles where low-power operation is common, which is why they have also been unsuccessful in automobiles. When jet fuel was very inexpensive in the 1950s and '60s the mechanical advantages of the engine -its inherent simplicity and very light weight- made up for the increased fuel costs. Several turbine-powered low-speed train designs were introduced during the 1950s and '60s, including both passenger and cargo engines. A number of high-speed passenger trainsets were also being designed in the 1960s, including the UAC TurboTrain in North America, the British Advanced Passenger Train (APT) and the French TGV 001. By the 1970s, especially after the 1973 oil crisis, these advantages were no longer enough to overcome the increased fuel costs, and most turbine-based train designs disappeared. While two large classes of gas-turbine powered intercity railcars (ETG and RTG) continued to be used in France up until about 2000, both the TGV and APT switched to all- electric operation, with the installation of overhead lines to support them. In North America, where funding to upgrade rail lines was limited, electric operation was only an option for the busiest routes, and remains rare. Canadian National Railway (CN) and Via Rail continued to run their TurboTrains into the early 1980s, before they too were replaced with diesel-electric units, such as the LRC train. Amtrak continued to run Rohr Turboliners until about 2003. (Turboliner) = JetTrain = Another change that has taken place over the last few decades is the widespread use and standardization of head end power (HEP) to provide electricity to the rest of the train for running the environmental controls and entertainment systems. Since these power requirements are fairly steady, even while the train is parked, it is not uncommon to use a separate engine just for this role, highly tuned to these operational needs. The JetTrain concept expands on this idea by using the same HEP engine to provide motive power during low-speed operation, bypassing the problems with turbine fuel efficiency at low power settings. The JetTrain concept uses only this engine while it is moving about the station area and switchyards. Once the train has left the switchyard, the turbine engine, a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150 (called the ST40 in this role), is started and the train accelerates to operational speed. The turbine engine is adapted from helicopter service, having the benefit of over 50 years of development in that service to improve its operational efficiency and reliability. It is adapted to operate on regular locomotive diesel fuel so that no special fueiling facilities need to be built to introduce the turbine locomotives on existing railroad lines. The diesel engine alone can run the train at speeds up to when empty, and the turbine increases that to . The two engines are geared together in a single gearbox which powers a generator to provide power to four traction motors, identical to those in the all-electric Acela Express. The generator is the motor from a TGV train, run in reverse of normal operation where instead of being hooked to electric power and producing rotation, it is rotated and produces electric power. The major advantage to using the turbine for the high-speed portion is its small physical size and light weight. The turbine engine is about the size of a common office desk and weighs only , while a conventional diesel motor of the same power is about 5 m (16 ft) long and weighs as much as . Using the turbine lowers the weight of the power cars; the JetTrain power car is and had an unsprung weight per axle of . This compares to the widely used EMD F40PH which weighs with an axle weight of . This reduction in mass per axle places considerably less stress on the rails, allowing the train to operate at higher speeds without changes to the railbed.\\"JetTrain: Existing Tracks\\" With a single power car towing seven passenger cars, the JetTrain could reach , although its maximum \\"balance speed\\" was . With two power cars, one at the front and one at the rear, the train could reach , with a maximum speed of .\\"JetTrain: Comparison\\" A complete train would normally consist of two power cars, one at either end, along with up to 11 passenger cars. The tilting passenger cars are versions of the ones used on the Acela, tracing their lineage to Bombardier's LRC tilting train introduced in the 1980s. In high speed passenger service, the JetTrain would be highly efficient. Due to its lighter weight and modern engine, the JetTrain has greenhouse gas emissions that are 30% lower than a diesel unit operating at the same speeds.\\"JetTrain: Air Quality\\" The engine is practically silent even at full power: in operation the train is the same volume as the all- electric Acela.\\"JetTrain: Noise\\"  History  Controls of the JetTrain The JetTrain originated in 1997 in the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) Next Generation High Speed Rail Program (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/395175) to develop high speed train technologies for services on routes outside the Northeast Corridor‚Äîwhere route volumes might not be great enough to make electrification an option. The FRA sought an industrial partner who would be willing to invest on a 50/50 basis, and FRA spokesman Warren Flatau commented, \\"Bombardier is the company that stepped up to the plate when we put out the word we were interested in doing this project. We believe that the project holds great potential for bringing about the high speed services that people across the country are expressing a desire for.\\" The final agreement was signed in October 1998, with the FRA and Bombardier each investing $13 million in the first prototype locomotive, which was built at the new Bombardier Mass Transit Corporation plant in Plattsburgh, New York. The prototype locomotive was completed in June 2000. It included the turbine propulsion system but did not implement the low-speed diesel motor approach. Safety testing started at the FRA's Pueblo, Colorado, test track in the summer of 2001, where it reached a maximum speed of 156 mph. The prototype was then taken on a tour of potential high speed sites. Their primary target was the Florida Overland Express for passenger service between Orlando and Tampa in the United States. In support of this program, the prototype visited Miami on 7 October 2003 and Orlando on the 11th. The Florida system was originally slated to open in 2009, but was denied funding by a referendum in 2004, after the start of detail engineering stages.Florida High Speed Rail Authority In Canada, Bombardier and Via Rail presented a proposal to use JetTrains on Via‚Äôs busy Quebec City-Windsor Corridor as part of their ViaFast proposal, but were unable to obtain funding from the national government. In January 2008, the premiers of Ontario and Quebec announced a feasibility study for the Corridor, giving high speed trains another chance. The Van Horne Institute has also completed a study with Bombardier regarding the suitability of JetTrain service between the two largest cities in Alberta, Edmonton and Calgary.Van Horne Institute, \\"The Next Rail-Volution\\" Retrieved on 12 April 2009 Other possibilities included new lines in Texas and to Las Vegas. In the United Kingdom, the JetTrain has been proposed as a replacement for the 125 mph diesel-electric HST.Rail Magazine, issue 550, page 33 Australian rail magazines have suggested the JetTrain as a viable option for high-speed rail in Australia to supplement the XPT (a version of the British HST) and Tilt Train. Bombardier more recently has begun conversations with the state government of Yucatan in Mexico for the development of the Transpeninsular Fast Train. The project aims to connect the state capital of M√©rida to the tourist resorts of the Mayan Riviera like Cancun and the Mayan Ruins of Chichen Itza. According to the Governor Ivonne Ortega, the train must run on diesel at an average speed of 100 mph, for which Bombardier deemed suitable the use of The JetTrain.Diario de Yucatan, \\"Autoridades avalan el tren peninsular\\" Retrieved on 14 April 2011 The demonstration turbine locomotive is presently (2019) stored at the Transportation Test Center in Pueblo, CO, awaiting an unknown future.

The National Sailing Academy and Portland Castle are on the left. The large buildings in the foreground are former naval buildings, now converted into luxury flats. Portland Castle entrance. Castletown is a small village in Underhill on the Isle of Portland in Dorset. It is located close to Fortuneswell, on the shores of Portland Harbour, and includes a sandy beach, as well as one of Portland's notable highlights; Portland Castle, while the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy is also located nearby. As with the rest of Portland's villages and settlements, Castletown has been designated as a conservation area, as it is a place of special architectural and historic interest. Underhill, incorporating Castletown and other settlements became designated in 1976 with boundary extensions in 1997 and 2000. History Originally the location for fishermen to launch their boats, Castletown later developed during the 19th century with the construction of Portland Harbour's breakwaters, and the establishment of the naval base. During the 16th century, Henry VII had selected Castletown area for the building of Portland Castle. Castletown was an essential part of the Merchant's Railway, which was operational from 1826-1939. At a time when stone was transported by sea, the railway brought stone from the quarries at Tophill to Castletown's pier for shipping. During the early 19th century, Castletown was still only a small settlement, with few residential properties. By the middle of the century, Castletown's character changed. A one-sided terrace was formed by 1864, and a number of businesses and residential properties established. Due to it being the gateway to the naval base, Castletown became a thriving commercial area. In 1944 Portland's harbour was commissioned as USNAAB Portland-Weymouth, becoming a major embarkation point for American troops during D-Day. Castletown saw many soldiers and vehicles pass through. In the early 1990s, as part of defence spending cuts, it was announced that naval base was to close. It was forecast that the Royal Navy's departure would bring economical disaster to Castletown. The navy left in 1995, and Castletown lost the majority of its income, leading to the gradual loss of a number of businesses. In October 2014 Nemesis Properties applied for planning permission to redevelop Castletown Pier, and work began during 2015 on transforming the pier into \\"Crabbers Wharf\\". In June 2015 further development plans were revealed for the regeneration of Castletown, including a \\"scuba diving tourist facility, an American themed D-Day attraction and museum.\\" It was also suggested that talks with Portland Port may allow Portland's two Mulberry Harbour Phoenix Units to be opened to the public. Features A small beach is found in the village, close to the entrance of Portland Port. The area still features several hotels and pubs, largely established for the navy personnel that once came from the port. The Osprey Leisure Centre is located in Castletown, which was formerly known as the Boscawen Centre, and was opened to the public in May 2007. Originally it was a private Royal Navy facility during the 1980s. Castletown also holds the Portland Community Hospital. This was originally a Royal Naval Hospital which served Portland's naval base from the late 19th century until 1957, when the hospital was handed over to the NHS. Castletown's Stone Pier, where stone was once shipped, is now mainly used for boat maintenance. To the southern side of the main road of Castletown two large multi-story accommodation buildings sit set into the steeply rising hillside. These blocks were known as the \\"Hardy Complex\\" with their construction allegedly costing between ¬£25-30 million and were built during the late 1980s and early 1990s as state-of-the-art accommodation for Royal Navy personnel, but were abandoned less than 15 years later when the Navy left the island. They were later sold by the MoD to a private developer/construction company, and then subsequently sold on again. Eventually they were acquired by development company Comer Homes, who secured planning consent to convert and refurbish the two buildings to provide a total of 554 1, 2, and 3 bedroom apartments and penthouses. During 2004-05 both blocks were stripped back to just their re-enforced concrete frames and left as empty shells. Re-construction work began on the right hand block, (subsequently named Ocean Views) in 2007 and the external works were largely completed by June 2008. Many of the completed apartments were rented as accommodation for visiting foreign sailing teams for their training, preparation and living quarters for the sailing events of the 2012 Olympics, which took place in Portland Harbour. Today the left block still remains derelict awaiting construction works to restart. Grade listed features Castletown has a wide array of architecture and buildings, a number of which are Grade Listed. Portland Castle has been designated as a Grade I Listed building. It is one of three buildings on Portland to be Grade I Listed. Additionally, in October 1981, the castle had become scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The Captain's House, a large detached house, adjoining Portland Castle, is designated a Grade II* Listed building. The gateway and curtain wall to the south east of the house became Grade II* Listed at the same time. Located around south of the entrance to The Captain's House is a War Department/Admiralty boundary marker, which has been Grade II Listed since May 1993. The Royal Breakwater Hotel was designated Grade II in May 1993. At the end of the village, at the entrance of Portland Port, is the former Dockyard Police Station. The MOD police station was initially a railway station, and is Grade II Listed.

It takes its name from old wooden wall telephones and candlestick telephones, where the mouthpiece was mounted on the telephone box and, due to sidetone considerations, the receiver was separate, on a cable. When the telephone was not in use, the receiver was hung on a spring-loaded hook; its weight would cause the hook to swing down and open an electrical contact, disconnecting something, but not the telephone from the line or the phone could not ring. When the handset is on the cradle, the telephone is said to be \\"on-hook\\", or ready for a call.

Description  thumb The body of the bleak is elongated and flat. The head is pointed and the relatively small mouth is turned upwards. The anal fin is long and has 18-23 fin rays. The lateral line is complete. The bleak has a shiny silvery colour, and the fins are pointed and colourless. Its maximum length is about 25 cm (10 in). In Europe, the bleak can easily be confused with many other species. In England, young common bream and silver bream can be confused with young bleak, though the pointed, upward- turned mouth of the bleak is already distinctive at young stages. Young roach and ruffe have wider bodies and short anal fins. Occurrence The bleak occurs in Europe and Western Asia: north of the Caucasus, Pyrenees, and Alps, and eastward toward the Volga basin in northern Iran and north-western Turkey. It is absent from Iberian and Apennine peninsulas, from the rivers of Adriatic watershed on the Balkans and most of British Isles except southeast England. It is locally introduced in Spain, Portugal, and Italy, though. The shiny and pearly colours on the head of a bleak in direct sunlight Ecology The bleak lives in great schools and feeds upon small molluscs, insects that fall in the water, insect larvae, worms, small shellfish, and plant detritus. It is found in streams and lakes. The bleak prefers open waters and is found in large numbers where an inflow of food from pumping stations or behind weirs occurs. = Spawning = The bleak spawns near the shore in shallow waters. Some are found in deep water. The substrate is not important. = Importance = The bleak is an important food source for predatory fish. It is more sensitive to pollution than other cyprinids, which might explain the decline in north- western Europe.  Uses  Bleak are used as bait for sport-fishing for larger fish.

History Special Duties was created in October 1977 by friends Steve Green (Aka Arrogant), Steve Norris (Aka Duty) and Nigel Baker. They were punks at school, but the idea of forming their own band came when they saw The Adverts in Colchester. The fact that the three schoolboys couldn't play and didn't own any instruments didn't discourage them. They decided to put Arrogant on vocals, Duty on guitar and Baker on Bass. The band was originally going to be named X-pelled, but they switched to Special Duties when a box of around 200 badges with \\"Special Duties\\" printed on them which had been stolen from a school in Colchester came into their possession, the band deciding that they could save money on getting badges made by simply changing their name to match the stolen ones. For their debut live show, the band spread the word through the underground punk grapevine that they would performing a free gig underneath the shopping precinct in Colchester. Hundreds of people turned up to see them play a fifteen-minute version of the only song they knew, \\"There'll Be No Tomorrow\\", performed in the Marks & Spencer loading bay. In 1980, Bart Povah joined the band and they recorded their first demo, which got them a record deal with Charnel House Records. The band moved to Rondelet Records soon after and recruited drummer Stuart Bray. Their second EP for the label, \\"Police State\\" spent two months in the indie chart, prompting Rondelet to get the band into the studio to record their debut album, 77 in 82. In 1982 Arrogant decided to declare war on the anarcho-punk band Crass. Their debut LP was followed by their biggest selling single \\"Bullshit Crass\\", an attack on a band that they saw as destroying the traditional punk scene. It came with a Crass-style sleeve and the lead track began with chants of \\"Fight Crass, not punk\\", parodying one of Crass's songs. Green explained: \\"It was the fact that they said 'Punk was dead', and they played this really tuneless music. I saw them as almost a religious cult\\". However, after that, their music's leading distributors, Rough Trade and Small Wonder, refused to stock their material. This censorship made life a burden for the band. In 1983 they released the single \\"Punk Rocker\\" which was not well distributed. In the same year, the group broke up. Twelve years later, Captain Oi! Records reissued 77 in 82, and encouraged by the response to it the band got back together, playing at 1995's Fuck Reading at the Brixton Academy. After that the group didn't split again. In 1997 the band released \\"Wembley Wembley! (Wembley here we come)\\" to commemorate Colchester United reaching the final of that year's AutoWindscreens Shield at Wembley. Also on the CD was a version of \\"Up the U's!\\" a song written about the football club and still sung there today. The third track contained brief interviews with players, such as Garrett Caldwell, Joe Dunne and former club captain Karl Duguid. In July 1998, the band travelled to New York for a gig at CBGB's, releasing the performance on the Live at CBGB's 1998 album. In 2007 the band re-recorded the \\"Up the U's!\\" with local band Koopa with a song entitled \\"Stand Up For Col U\\" by Koopa and with the vocals of Colchester United players Jamie Cureton, Chris Iwelumo, Wayne Brown, Karl Duguid, Kevin Watson, Pat Baldwin, Kevin McLeod and Dean Gerken. The single was released to raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust. In 2012, Steve Arrogant left the band and Steve Duty took over from his friend on vocals and Dave Sadler took over on Bass. In 2014 they signed to the Jailhouse Records label. which produced two discography releases. They began regularly gigging and recording, with multiple festival appearances, shows, and a U.S tour in 2016 and US festivals headlines since. In 2020 the band recorded their new 14 track album ‚ÄúSeven Days A Week. The band are in discussions with Record Labels about the release date...

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is bounded by the Knavesmire, an open area of land on which York Racecourse is situated, to the east, Askham Bog and the A64 to the south, Woodthorpe and Foxwood to the west, and Acomb and Holgate to the north. It is part of the City of York ward is called Dringhouses and Woodthorpe which covers an area of and had a population of 11,084 at the 2011 Census. It is located approximately two and quarter miles from York City Centre. The name derives from \\"Drengeshirses\\" (1109) and means \\"the houses of the drengs\\", a \\"dreng\\" being a man who held land by a particular kind of free tenure. It is a mixture of housing estates and large open spaces, with the East Coast main railway line running through the middle. History The Fox and Roman public house takes its name from a Roman burial excavated here in 1997. Five Neolithic stone axes provide the earliest evidence for human activity in the area of Dringhouses which is located on a ridge of glacial moraine running southwest from York that may have been used during the Bronze Age as a well-defined trade route. A Roman road linking Eboracum (York) with Calcaria (Tadcaster) was constructed on this route along which civilian settlements developed as shown by archaeological evidence including a Roman cemetery and timber-framed buildings from the 1st to 2nd- century. The Old Norse name from which Dringhouses is derived, indicates the villagers were the descendants of Halfdan, the Viking leader who had taken the area from the Angles and had shared the land among his warriors in 876. The free land of the Drengs became a Norman manor - ultimately owned by Archbishop Walter de Gray who granted it to his brother Robert in 1244 and thence to John, Lord Grey of Rotherfield. The title passed to Sir John Deincourt and his ancestors until it was inherited by the Wilkinson family. The last Lord of the manor, Col. Wilkinson, died on 13 January 1941. The subsequent break-up of the estate meant that most of the land in the village was no longer owned by one family. There was a long dispute over the Wapentake of the Ainsty - which included Dringhouses - from the early Middle Ages. In 1276 the Courts of Edward I dealt with a claim by the York Corporation that:-\\"... the citizens of York hold the wapentake of Ainsty and the city of York of the King...\\". The claim was based on a Charter of the reign of King John and the case was lost on the grounds that the extent of the land was not specified and, more seriously, that the Charter contained erasures. For this the Mayor was held responsible and was imprisoned for a short time. The claim was revived in 1448 and upheld. From that date until 1832 the people of the Ainsty and therefore Dringhouses were under the authority of York Corporation. Though Dringhouses was within the parish of Holy Trinity Priory, Micklegate, it formed a separate manor and thus lay outside of the City of York. In St Helen's Road, between 1920 and 1946, the house next to the Cross Keys car park was the Club House for the 15-hole golf course on the Hob Moor, which later moved, as the York Golf Club, to Strensall, with the railway workers who used to play there moving to Pike Hills Golf Club. The present shops on Tadcaster Road were originally a row of cottages known as Meek's Buildings, nicknamed \\"Washing Tub Row\\" because those who lived there took in washing for the gentry. Dringhouses village was incorporated into the City in 1937. The present Marriott Hotel (formerly the Chase Hotel) stands at the boundary of the village with the city and was the terminus for the trams in their heyday. The electric trams replaced the horse bus in 1911. Goddards House and Garden in Dringhouses is a former home of the Terry family, famed chocolate makers. This Grade I listed building was built in 1927 and is a visitor attraction and regional office of the National Trust. Hob Moor, which forms part of the Knavesmire and hence Micklegate Stray, is first mentioned in documents in 1374 as '\\"Yhorkesmore\\"\\"' and first noted as '\\"Hobbe Moore\\"' in 1624 by the cartographer, Samuel Parsons. During the early 17th century, accommodation was constructed to house plague victims on Hob Lane, leading to the Moor. This is indicated by the Plague Stone still visible today. Next to this stone is the '\\"Hob Stone\\"' which depicts the shield and effigy of a knight of the de Ros family, who is reputed to have given his name to the area. In 1745, the York to Tadcaster Turnpike was constructed, which follows the route of the modern Tadcaster Road in the area. The Moor has been used as an area for the Military. In 1644, the Scottish troops, who were part of the Parliamentarian Army, were encamped here during the siege of York. From 1912 to 1920, the Moor was used for training Cavalry troops. On the eastbound carriageway of Tadcaster Road in Dringhouses is a small brick enclosure that was once used as a pinfold. It is located opposite Royal Chase. Governance Dringhouses is part of the Dringhouses and Woodthorpe Ward in the Unitary Authority of York. it is represented by Liberal Democrat Councillors Stephen Fenton, Ashley Mason and Paula Widdowson. It forms part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer and EU Constituency of Yorkshire and the Humber. Demography The 2011 census recorded that the population of the Ward was 11,084 of which 91.1% were born in England and 4.9% from outside the United Kingdom. The mean age was 43.1 years with 44.4% aged between 30 and 59. Of the total population 94.8% described their ethnic origin as White-British. The 2011 figures show that 64.9% declared they were Christian, whilst 26.3% declared they had no religion, whereas this had been 79.2% Christian and 14.0% no religion in 2001. Of the population in 2011 aged between 16 and 74 years old, 72.6% declared they were economically active and 18.3% said they were retired. Between 2001 and 2011 the number of households increased from 4,650 to 4986, of which 50.1% were Semi-Detached and 29.6% were Detached. The level of household ownership was 80.4%. Economy In past years, the majority of employment was in agriculture. As of 2010, the main employment can be found in the retail and education sectors, as Dringhouses has a large Tesco supermarket and the York College. Employment can be found in the Health Care centre as St Leonards' Hospice is located next to the York College. A small amount of employment can be found in the Leisure sector as two major chain hotels are located on Tadcaster Road. The racing stables on Hunters Way also provide employment. Geography Dringhouses Milepost Dringhouses is located just over two miles south of York city centre: there are two Grade II listed milestones along Tadcaster Road that give the distances from York of 1 1/2 miles, just north of Dringhouses, (between Nelson's Lane and Chalfonts) and 2 1/2 miles, at the south end (opposite the Tesco store). The East Coast Main Line runs through the centre of the area. There are some open areas of land including Marsh farm, Chaloners Whin and Sim Hills. Council run allotments can be found at the entrance to Hob Moor on Tadcaster Road. There are areas of open water near Aintree Court, Bramble Dene and at Chapmans Pond and Hogg's Pond on Moor Lane. There are several small becks or streams in the area, namely on Hob Moor and on Chaloners Whin. The largest open area is Hob Moor which is part of the Knavesmire, that together make up Micklegate Stray. This land was once used for growing crops as demonstrated by the ridges and furrows still evident. As of 2010, it is still used as grazing land, licensed by York City Council. Hob Moor was designated as a Local Nature Reserve in 2003 and hosts a variety of flora and fauna. Amongst the birds that can be found here are meadow pipit, skylark, whinchat, wheatear, yellow wagtail and merlin. Play areas can be found at Nelson's Lane, Heron Avenue (owned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation), Woodthorpe Green and Leeside. The York to Tadcaster turnpike ran through this area following the route of the modern Tadcaster Road, which formed part of the old A64 to Leeds.

First York operate several local bus services passing through Dringhouses the most frequent being the and routes. They also operate a Park and Ride service from Askham Bar. Connexionsbuses operate a service and York Pullman operate along Tadcaster Road as part of their service between Tadcaster and York. Transdev operate Cityzap services between Leeds and York, and several Coastliner routes between Leeds and the Yorkshire coast. Education Dringhouses Primary School Primary education is catered for at Dringhouses Primary School on St Helens Road. The original school was founded in 1849 - adjacent to the church. In 1852 a new school was built and is now the local library. It then moved into the old school house on its present site next to the railway in 1904, designed by architect Walter Brierley. After the school moved the 1852 building was used as a reading room until 1942. Part of the Grade II listed building then became the Wilkinson Memorial Library, usually referred to as Dringhouses Library, when the building was given for the benefit of the local citizens following the death of Colonel Wilkinson in 1941. A plaque to commemorate this was unveiled in March 2016. York College has its campus at the former Tollcross at the south-western edge of Dringhouses and caters for Sixth Form and Further Education in York. The college was built on the area previously occupied by Ashfield Secondary School, the nearby old York College of Arts & Technology being demolished for a new housing estate. Religion The Church of St Edward the Confessor, Dringhouses The Church of St Edward the Confessor is located on Tadcaster Road, opposite the junction with St Helen's Road, St Helen being the patron of previous chapels on the same site. Chantry certificates of 1546 and 1548 record the existence of a chapel of ease dedicated to St Helen in Dringhouses. This was replaced by a new chapel in 1725, of which some floor tiles remain in situ beside the present church. At the time it was within the parish of Holy Trinity, Micklegate, and was the only church within a city parish in York to have been rebuilt during the 18th century. The Church of St Edward was built in 1847-49 and received its own parish in 1853. It is a grade II listed building and was designed by Vickers and Hugall of Pontefract. It was constructed of limestone with green slate roof-tiles, however the spire was replaced with a fibreglass replica in 1970. The church contains some woodwork carvings by Mousie Thompson. Parish records dating from 1824 are held at the Borthwick Institute in York. In the churchyard is a war memorial (grade II listed) designed by Brierley and Rutherford in 1922, which lists the names of those who died in the World Wars. A Methodist chapel was built in Dringhouses in 1834 at the corner of Slingsby Grove and Tadcaster Road; Methodism having been introduced to the area in 1816. This was replaced in 1890 with a larger building, known as \\"Dringhouses Chapel\\", on the same site. This closed when the chapel was relocated to a new building in West Thorpe, which opened on 17 July 1954. Scouting Dringhouses Scout Group is one of the largest in York and North Yorkshire and is home to over 220 young people between the ages of 6 and 17 years old. The Beaver Scouts (6-8yrs) meet in three groups called Colonies, these are named 1st, 2nd and 3rd. The Cub Scouts (8-10¬Ωyrs) meet in three groups called Packs and these are named Romans, Saxons and Vikings. There are three Scout Troops (10¬Ω-14yrs). These are named Parish Church Troop, St Edward's Troop and St Helen's Troop. Yorvik Explorer Scout Unit (14-17yrs) also meet at Dringhouses, providing activities for the oldest youth members. Sport Dringhouses Sports and Social Club on St Helens Road next to the railway lines, provide football and cricket teams to local leagues. It is also the meeting place for the York Knavesmire Harriers Athletic Club. Dringhouses AFC play in the York Football League Premier Division and Dringhouses Reserves are in Reserve Division B.

The law school was founded in 1868. Facilities The law school is located on Bascom Hill, the center of the UW‚ÄìMadison campus. In 1996, it completed a major renovation project that joined two previous buildings and created a four-story glass atrium. The renovation was recognized by the American Institute of Architects for its innovative design, incorporating modern design into the 150 years of architecture on historic Bascom Hill. In addition to lecture halls and smaller classrooms, the law school contains a fully functional trial courtroom, appellate courtroom, and an extensive law library. The library is noted for the 1942 mural \\"The Freeing of the Slaves\\" by John Steuart Curry that dominates the Quarles & Brady Reading Room (also known as the \\"Old Reading Room\\"). Legal philosophy The University of Wisconsin Law School subscribes to a \\"law in action\\" legal philosophy. This philosophy proposes that to truly understand the law, students must not only know the \\"law on the books\\", but also study how the law is actually practiced by professionals. The law school's classroom discussions, involvement with other campus departments, scholarship, and clinical practica all emphasize the interplay between law and society. Journals and publications The University of Wisconsin Law School's flagship journal is the Wisconsin Law Review, which was founded in 1920 and became an entirely student-run law review in 1935. Students at the law school also publish two specialty journals: the Wisconsin International Law Journal, established in 1982, and the Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender & Society, a continuation of the Wisconsin Women's Law Journal, established in 1985. A third specialty journal, the Wisconsin Environmental Law Journal, was founded in 1994 but discontinued publication in 2002. Clinical programs The law school places a great emphasis on its clinical programs, as part of its law-in-action curriculum. The most well-known clinic is the Frank J. Remington Center, named after the late UW law professor Frank J. Remington. The center runs a variety of programs focused on the practice of criminal law. The largest program in the Center is the Legal Assistance to Institutionalized Persons (LAIP) Project, which provides legal services to inmates incarcerated in Wisconsin. The center also runs clinics focused on family law, criminal defense, criminal prosecution, criminal appeals, community-oriented policing, a restorative justice project, and an innocence project that attempts to reverse judgments against wrongfully convicted defendants. The law school also runs a group of clinics focusing on civil law called the Economic Justice Institute. This clinical grouping includes the Neighborhood Law Clinic, which serves underrepresented clients in landlord/tenant, workers' rights, and public benefit disputes; the Family Court Clinic; the Consumer Law Clinic; the Immigrant Justice Clinic; and the VOCA Restraining Order Clinic. The Restraining Order Clinic provides support for petitioners for a domestic abuse restraining order. The Law and Entrepreneurship Clinic focuses on transactional law and provides assistance to start-ups and business entities. Finally, the Center for Patient Partnerships is an interdisciplinary patient advocacy clinical housed in the law school in which students of law, medicine, nursing, social work, pharmacy, public policy etc. serve as advocates for people with life-threatening illnesses as they negotiate the health care system. Traditions 1893 engraving of the University of Wisconsin College of Law building The most visible tradition at the law school is that of the Gargoyle. The Gargoyle graced the roof of the original law school building, built in 1893. When that building was torn down in 1963, the gargoyle was found intact among the rubble and was saved as an unofficial mascot. It became the symbol of the law school and was displayed outside the law school building for many years. With the most recent renovation, it moved to a more protected location inside the law school atrium. The image of the gargoyle graces the cover of the Wisconsin Law Review and the law school alumni magazine is called the Gargoyle. Its image has been applied to law school memorabilia. In addition to the Gargoyle, \\"Blind Bucky\\" is also sometimes used as an unofficial mascot of the law school. Another tradition is the homecoming cane toss, which dates from the 1930s. Before the university's homecoming football game, third-year law students run from the north end of the football field at Camp Randall Stadium to the south end wearing bowler hats and carrying canes. When the students reach the goalpost on the south end of the field, they attempt to throw their canes over the goalpost. Legend has it that if the student successfully throws the cane over the goalpost and catches it, she will win her first case; if she fails to catch it, the opposite will hold true. Another tradition is an annual fall competition between the law and medical schools at the university. This competition, called the Dean's Cup, raises funds for local charities. Diploma privilege The University of Wisconsin Law School is one of only two law schools in the United States whose graduates enjoy diploma privilege as a method of admission to the bar. Unlike all other jurisdictions in the United States, Wisconsin's state bar allows graduates of accredited law schools within the state to join the bar without taking the state's bar examination if they complete certain requirements in their law school courses and achieve a certain level of performance in those courses. The other school with this privilege is the Marquette University Law School. Wisconsin residents who graduate from out-of-state law schools must pass the bar exam to be admitted to the bar in Wisconsin. Some states, but not all, will grant reciprocal admission to Wisconsin bar members admitted by diploma privilege after they have completed a certain number of years in the practice of law. Rankings In its 2021 edition of Best Graduate Schools, U.S. News & World Report ranked the school 38th among the 192 law schools fully accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA).U.S. News & World Report According to the 2018 source of academic ranking, UW-Madison law school's graduate programs had been ranked among the world's best, which investigated most cited legal scholars on Westlaw and performance of graduates in the legal education market.  Employment  According to the law school's 2019 ABA required disclosures, 77.2 percent of the Class of 2018 obtained full-time, long-term, bar passage-required employment nine months after graduation.

Half-sword, in 14th- to 16th-century fencing with longswords, refers to the technique of gripping the central part of the sword blade with the left hand in order to execute more forceful thrusts against armoured and unarmoured opponents. The term is a translation of the original German Halbschwert. The technique was also referred to as mit dem kurzen Schwert, \\"with the shortened sword\\" in German. Page of the Codex Wallerstein showing a half-sword thrust against a Mordhau. (Plate 214) Half-sword is used for leverage advantage when wrestling with the sword, as well as for delivering a more accurate and powerful thrust. Both of these are critical when fighting in plate armour because a slice or a cleaving blow from a sword is virtually useless against iron or steel plate. Most medieval treatises show armoured combat as consisting primarily of fighting at the half-sword; the best options against an armoured man being a strong thrust into less-protected areas such as the armpits or throat or, even better, the same against a man who has already been cast to the ground. Some weapons may have been modified specifically for this purpose, sporting what is called a ricasso. Some longswords had a short ricasso, usually too close to the cross and hilt of the blade for practical use in half-swording except as a point of extra leverage in a thrust. The ricasso on larger swords, such as the two-handed sword, provided a longer area more fitting for gripping during half-swording. Filippo Vadi suggests that a sword be sharp only at the tip. It has been suggested that some swords were left unsharpened in a part of the sword a hand's breadth wide about halfway down the blade in order to facilitate this technique. In Italian and English, \\"half sword\\" refers to a crossing of the sword in the middle of the blade, and by extension the relatively close range at which this takes place.

The Free Academy's introductory year gradually evolved and in 1904 became a full-fledged, 3-year high school, housed on three floors of what is now Baruch College (in the East Side Manhattan neighborhood of Kips Bay). \\"The school was still in its quarters at 23d Street and Lexington Avenue, occupying a spartan campus on the 9th to 12th floors of the building which now houses CUNY‚Äôs Baruch College.\\" Summer 2005 Townsend Harris Alumni Magazine , p.10 This original incarnation, known as Townsend Harris Hall, survived until 1942 when it was closed by mayor Fiorello La Guardia for budgetary reasons.https://thaa.org/thaa_history.html Townsend Harris High School was refounded in 1984 thanks largely to the efforts of alumni of the original school, who had begun the process in 1980. The first principal was Malcolm Largmann, a former high school English teacher with a strong belief in a classically styled education who also handpicked the school's original faculty. The new school began life in a small building on Parsons Boulevard, originally intended as a temporary home until a permanent facility could be realized. In early 1995, the school moved into a new building located on the campus of Queens College. Brian Condon became principal after a heated debate concerning Interim Principal Rosemarie Jahoda. Entrance to the High School on 149th Street. Admissions Well over 12,000 students compete for approximately 270 seats in the freshman class each year based on their middle school grades, standardized test scores and even attendance records. Admission is available to all New York City residents in 8th grade. A minimum grade point average of 90 is required of all applicants to be considered for admission. Minimum standardized reading and math scores at the 90th percentile are also required (682 for reading and 713 for math).New York City High School Directory Some seats are available for 9th graders wishing to start Townsend as sophomores, though as the number depends on the number of students who decide to leave the school during freshman year the number varies significantly from year to year; in 2006, only 5 were available. Initially, the admissions process included an interview and a writing component, but this was eliminated by 1988. Upon matriculation, students take a writing and math exam. Students must fulfill prerequisite grade standards to earn admission in addition to the examination. Academics In addition to the standard three- year Regents English program, all students take a \\"fifth year\\" of English as freshman in the form of classes in linguistics and writing processes. In addition to the standard modern language requirement which may be fulfilled with classes in Spanish, French or Japanese, students must have a two-year classical language requirement which can be fulfilled by classes in Latin or classical Greek (in addition, Hebrew is offered as an elective course). There is also a rigorous physical education requirement, especially freshman gym, and a senior project required of students. A variety of electives and AP classes are also offered to students. As of 2004, AP World History became a mandatory subject and replaced the Regents-level course. Every subject requires students to execute at least one major project a year, with history classes requiring one per semester and English several per semester. These projects are referred to as \\"collaterals.\\" In the 2008-2009 school year, Townsend Harris is offering the following Advanced Placement (AP) classes: World History, United States History, United States Government, Environmental Science, Psychology, Calculus AB/BC, Computer Science, Japanese Language and Culture, Latin: Vergil, Statistics, French Language, Art History, and Spanish Language, Spanish Literature. The most notable feature of the school's curriculum is the senior \\"Bridge Year\\" program. Students in good standing may take up to 12 credits at Queens College at no cost to themselves. This includes a required humanities seminar co-taught by Harris teachers and Queens College faculty. The curriculum and format is foundationally fairly similar to the Great Books seminars required of liberal arts freshman at colleges around the world, with heavy emphasis on critical reading and writing. Recently, a number of other New York City public high schools have been established that have similar \\"bridge year\\" programs. These include the High School of American Studies at Lehman College, Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, and Bard High School Early College. Student body In sharp contrast with the original school which was open to male students only, the new school has been dominated by female students from its inception, today comprising approximately 70% of the student population.2005-2006 Annual School Report As of 2006, the school's minority population is largely Asian, with the New York City Department of Education's \\"Asian and other\\" category making up 44% of the student body total, comprising the largest segment of the school's population. White students comprise 37% of the population, Hispanic students 12% and black students 7%.2005-2006 New York State School Report Card Accountability and Overview Report The school maintains a 100% graduation rate.2004-2005 Annual School Report Miscellaneous The attendance rate is the highest in NYC.http://schools.nyc.gov/OA/SchoolReports/2008-09/Progress_Report_2009_HS_Q525.pdf Scores on standardized examinations are also high when compared to other public high schools; in the year 2005-2006, Harrisites had average scores of 628 and 632 on the SAT verbal and math sections, respectively, compared to 551 and 565 for what the city deems \\"similar schools\\" and 444 and 467 for students citywide.http://schools.nyc.gov/OA/SchoolReports/2005-06/ASR_Q525.pdf In 2000 Eileen F.

Biography He was born at Ferrara, but moved to Bologna by his early twenties, and was probably influenced by the Bolognese School. However, many artists worked in both cities, and thus some consider him a product of the School of Ferrara. It is possible that he trained with Cosimo Tura. In 1483 he painted the famous Bentivoglio Altarpiece and other frescoes on the walls of the Bentivoglio chapel in San Giacomo Maggiore. He was a great friend of Francesco Francia, who was much influenced by him. In 1509 he moved to Mantua to become the court painter of Marquis Francesco Gonzaga and Isabella d'Este. For the latter's studiolo in the Ducal Palace, he painted the Allegory of Isabella d'Este's Coronation (now at the Louvre) and the Reign of Comus, two mythological paintings based on Mantegna's drawings. He died at Mantua in 1535. His sons Ippolito and Girolamo were also painters, as was Girolamo's son, Lorenzo the Younger. Contemporaries who worked with or under him include Cosimo Tura, Dosso Dossi, Ludovico Mazzolino, Lorenzo Leonbruno, and Niccol√≤ Pisano.

He later taught Zisi (Kong Ji), the grandson of Confucius, who was in turn the teacher of Mencius, thus beginning a line of transmitters of orthodox Confucian traditions. He is revered as one of the Four Sages of Confucianism. Life Statue of Zengzi (right) and his mother Zeng Shen was 46 years younger than Confucius. He was a native of South Wu City in the State of Lu, and was the son of Zeng Dian, one of the earliest disciples of Confucius. When he was sixteen, he was sent by his father to study under Confucius. Confucians later considered him to be his second most senior student, after Yan Hui. Duanmu Ci said of him, \\"There is no subject which he has not studied. His appearance is respectful. His virtue is solid. His words command credence. Before great men he draws himself up in the pride of self-respect. His eyebrows are those of longevity.\\" He was noted for his filial piety, and after the death of his parents he could not read the rites of mourning without being led to think of them and being moved to tears. He was a voluminous writer. He composed ten books, compiled in the Rites of the Elder Dai (). He was said to have composed and/or edited the Classic of Filial Piety under the direction of Confucius. He was also associated with transmission of the Great Learning. He was first associated with the sacrifices to Confucius in 668 AD, but in 1267 he was advanced to be one of Confucius' Four Assessors. His title, \\"Exhibitor of the Fundamental Principles of the Sage\\", dates from the reign of the Jiajing Emperor, when he was associated with Yan Hui. Zengzi established his own school, and taught Zisi (Kong Ji), the grandson of Confucius, who was in turn the teacher of Mencius, thus beginning a line of transmitters of orthodox Confucian traditions. Along with Yan Hui, Zisi, and Mencius, Zengzi is considered to be one of the Four Sages of Confucianism. Filial piety Zengzi (right) kneeling before Confucius (center), as depicted in a painting from the Illustrations of the Classic of Filial Piety, Song dynasty Zeng Shen was known for his filial piety. After the deaths of his parents, he was unable to read the rites of mourning without bursting into tears. A famous legend about Zeng Shen, called Nie Zhi Tong Xin (), is included in the influential Yuan dynasty text The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars. In the story, Zeng Shen was one day out gathering firewood, when some visitors unexpectedly showed up at his home. His mother bit her finger, and Zeng felt a sharp pain in his heart. He immediately knew his mother needed him and rushed home.

Questions about particular animals are sometimes answered by the strip's other characters, Rosko the cat, Mouth the myna bird, and Slippy the flying squirrel. In 1995 Guren was receiving more than 15,000 letters a year, with about 75% of them from children. Readers received a free Shagg doll if their question appeared in the strip. The strips generally featured a joke of some sort about the subject animal in addition to providing an accurate answer to the day's question. (For example, one strip answered a question about hamsters storing food in their cheeks and then compared it to a human carrying their money in their mouths. The last panel then showed a picture of a person holding their money in their mouth.) Community service Guren has often used Ask Shagg to raise money or awareness for causes. His Shagg E.

It lies northeast of Bexleyheath, northwest of Dartford and south of Erith, and east-southeast of Charing Cross. History and development = Etymology = An Anglo-Saxon dictionary asserts that \\"Slade\\" most commonly meant a broad strip of grass- covered land. The London Borough of Bexley suggests the current name most likely derives from Saxon \\"Slade\\", with their definition being low-lying ground. An alternative is the Viking \\"Slad\\", meaning a place for launching boats. Most sources agree that \\"Green\\" was added to reflect the deep colour of the grass-covered ground. Sources differ on when Slade Green was first mentioned with one suggesting the 16th Century. = Prehistory = Collectors such as Flaxman Charles John Spurrell discovered diverse palaeolithic fossils around Slade Green, along with flint artefacts that provide evidence of prehistoric human habitation. Pre-war maps indicate a barrow stood near the current Hazel Drive children's play area, and the Museum of London Archaeological Service revealed the presence of a prehistoric cookery pit at Hollywood Way.Museum of London summary of archaeological work carried out in 1997 accessed 6 April 2008 = Medieval = Some sources claim the area is recorded in the Domesday book as Hov, and others suggest this was Hou (later Howbury). An early translation states that Howbury was a hamlet on the bank of River Darent, which is approximately 1 km east of the small Slade Green hamlet recorded by 19th Century geographers. According to Bexley borough council, this medieval hamlet was held by Askell. Askell the Priest from Abingdon Abbey held estates in various parts of England and bequeathed titles to Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester. A moated seigneurial residence was built much closer Slade Green in the High Middle Ages, with its country house completed during the English Renaissance, and these structures were named Howbury Manor. An adjacent tithe barn, with 17th Century styling, has not been accurately dated. Surrounding green belt marshes contain willows thought to have been planted over 300 years ago to shelter livestock. :See also History of Kent and Kingdom of Kent = Victorian = The communities of North End and Slades GreenKent Rail website page on Slade Green station accessed 6 March 2008 (formerly Slads GreenOrdnance Survey and Ordnance Survey of Scotland First Series, 1805 accessed 10 September 2016) had remained disjointed throughout the agricultural revolution.

Evidence suggests the region remained sparsely populated yet highly productive throughout the industrial revolution. The 1869-1882 Ordnance Survey recorded a particularly large ‚ÄúSladesgreen Farm‚Äù with its south-west corner occupied by ‚ÄúThe Corner Pin‚Äù beerhouse. The pub was demolished and rebuilt in 1958. The surrounding area was affectionately known locally as ‚ÄúCabbage Island‚Äù in reference to the market gardens located between Moat Lane (formerly Whitehall Lane) and Slade Green Road (formerly Slade Green Lane).Review of book 'An Illustrated History of Slade Green Depot accessed 27 June 2007commentary by person with family from the area at genealogy.com accessed 27 June 2007[Oak Road Conservation Area Consultation Draft, Bexley Council February 2008] pdf version accessed 6 March 2008 at http://www.bexley.gov.uk/service/consultations/conservationareas_phase2/pdfs/oak_road_conservation_area.pdf Victorian photographic evidence captures the high crop yield of these agricultural gardens at Slade Green. Historic maps also chronicle an increasing number of clay pits along the railway on the North End side of the tracks. Marshes are a natural source of clays and brick earths, and local firms produced large numbers of London stock bricks throughout the 19th Century. ‚ÄúFurner of Slade Green‚Äú operated the North End brickworks from 1867 to 1911. Slade Green gained a National School in 1868, and became a village when St. Augustine's Church opened in 1899. The isolated Crayford Marshes, which could support barges along the Rivers Thames and Darent, were seen as an ideal location for the 40 acre ammunition works that may have operated from 1879 to 1962. Noted mechanical engineer, Hugh Ticehurst MBE, worked at the site from 1893 to 1930. A comparison of historic and contemporary maps confirms that the boundaries of the Victorian site outline the current Darent Industrial Estate or Crayford Ness Industrial Area.Managing the Marshes Summary of Baseline data (page 7) (Bexley November 2004) accessed 27 June 2007 = Edwardian = Rapid expansion followed the construction of a major rail depot designed to service 100 steam locomotives for South Eastern and Chatham Railway. A small station was added to serve the depot and community on 1 July 1900 (its name changed from Slades Green station to Slade Green station in 1953), and by 1910 the complete 'railway village' of 158 houses had been built. It follows that today's much larger and more densely populated Slade Green could be described as a railway town. By 1902 the secure Thames Munition Works was operated by Armstrong Whitworth and equipped with a Thames peer connected to an internal railway. Bexley borough's archived photos suggest the significance of the village had increased by 1905 and that it had absorbed historically important Howbury Manor. = First World War = NTWFF Erith, a National Trench Warfare Filling Factory, was constructed next to the larger Thames Munition Works in 1915. For a short time a mortar filling station was connected to Slade Green station by the 1¬Ω mile ‚ÄúTrench Warfare Light Railway‚Äù. Miss Mary Edith Sheffield, identified only as a superintendent at the Thames Ammunition Works in the Crayford Marshes adjacent to Slade Green, was awarded MBE in King George V's 1918 Birthday Honours. = Interwar = Slade Green endured a national tragedy. En-masse explosions at a former Trench Warfare Filling Factory operated by Messrs. W.V. Gilbert, a contractor to the Disposal and Liquidation Commission, caused blinding flashes and the death of 13 workers on 19 February 1924.A Tragedy That Rocked The Nation on 'Whitstable Scene' accessed 1 October 2007 The W.V. Gilbert factory was near to or adjoining Thames Munition Works. The parliamentary debate that followed showed that the contract did not require a Fair Wages Clause, and was exempt from the provisions of the Explosives Act of 1875. A prominent mass grave at Northumberland Heath stands in memory of the victims. Development may have stagnated in the interwar years. Records show a Baptist Church was built on Elm road in the early 1930s, and Anti-Aircraft defences were constructed on the edge of Slade Green in the late 1930s. Variant spelling persisted as evidenced by Parliament recording \\"Slade Green\\" in 1924 and at least one chartered geographer recording \\"Slades Green\\" in 1933. Thames Munition Works Ltd. became part of the Vickers-Armstrongs conglomerate in 1927. = Second World War = Throughout Second World War the marshes were used for the 4.5-inch HAA Guns of the 6th Anti-Aircraft Division, corresponding with No. 11 Group RAF. The 4th Home Counties Brigade (Kent) formed from volunteers in the surrounding area in 1908, deployed overseas, and manned London's air defences at Slade Green in 1941. The disused command post and circular battery ramparts remain in the marshes between Slade Green and the former munition works. Slade Green was subject to a series of air raids, notably the night of 16 April 1941 when incendiary raids caused many fires and explosions capable of levelling the area; these threats were contained by the brave intervention of residents resulting in the award of three British Empire Medals and a George Medal.Thomas, E.O.Slade Green and the Crayford Marshes, Bexley Education and Leisure Services Directorate, 2001, The Museum of London states that Howbury Manor House, pictured within the moated medieval walls, was bombed during an air raid and then demolished. RAF campaign diaries show Thames Ammunition Works was hit on 12 October 1940. During the war the community was served by a British Restaurant operating from St. Augustine's Church Hall, which supplied up to 250 lunches six days a week to residents, the school, and nearby factories. = Postwar = Aerial photographs taken during the North Sea flood of 1953 show the Thames Munition Works. Explosives operations ended in the 1960s, and Bexley borough council gave planning permission for an industrial estate on the site in the 1970s. Slade Green emerged as a London suburb in the post-war era following the construction of at least 1050 new dwellings, and a road bridge spanning the North Kent Line. =Notable buildings and structures= The Scheduled Ancient Monument known as Howbury Moat or Howbury Manor (c.900), and a Grade II Listed Tithe Barn (c.1600s), are located between Slade Green and Crayford Marshes. According to Historic England, the interior of the medieval moated site includes a 16th or 17th century country house, with some significant surviving architectural details, and it appears to the Secretary of State to be of national importance. Holders of the Manor of Howbury included Bishop Odo, Roger Apylton (aka Appleton) and Sir Cloudesley Shovell. After Apylton had May Place built in Crayford, occupants of the moated site were tenant farmers, and after the building of a new house (Howbury Grange) for the tenant farmer in 1882, by farm labourers, until the building was condemned in 1934. Photographic evidence from 1935 provides a glimpse of Howbury Manor House, which was bombed and demolished during WW2. In 2006 the medieval moat site was the subject of an English Heritage sponsored research project by the University of Oxford's Geography Department into techniques of Soft Wall Capping for preservation purposes.Soft capping historic walls accessed 6 April 2008 Following an investigation by English Heritage, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport listed the Second World War anti-aircraft batteries in Slade Green's London artillery zone. Locally listed buildings are the former Railway Tavern, the Grange and Cottages at Howbury farm, and train sheds with works. Oak Road is a conservation area with Railway workers' cottages dating to 1900. The former Railway Tavern (1a Moat Lane), built by Smith & Sons of South Norwood around 1899, was notable for being illuminated by electricity. St. Augustine's Church was built in 1899 and extended in 1911. Substantial rebuilding was required following a direct hit during a Second World War air raid in 1944, and following a fire in 1991 that destroyed the roof along with much of the internal fabric. Present and future =Social= In 2013 the Communities Secretary recognised the endurance of historic county borders. Slade Green is in the historic county of Kent, and Slade Green is not in the current non-metropolitan county of Kent. The Howbury Centre was replaced with a new Slade Green & Howbury Community Centre in 2014, which hosts the public library and many social activities.Newsshopper article on plans for the Howbury Centre site accessed 6 March 2008 Churches include a Baptist Union Christian Fellowship, and St Augustine's Anglican parish church; a third Pentecostal church meets in the Anglican church hall. There are two pubs, and other bars at the Slade Green Railway Club and Erith Yacht Club. The latter relocated from Erith to a site on the edge of Slade Green in 1900. Slade Green F.C. last competed in 2009. =Environment= The adjacent Crayford Marshes have been recognised as ecologically significant since circa 1980 and are now designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The area is popular with bird watchers and video footage shows breeding seals on the waterfront. Bexley borough council has discussed intentions to meet the needs of residents as well as the needs of protected amphibians and reptiles. The site of listed HAA batteries is managed by the London Wildlife Trust. =Development= Slade Green is identified in the London Plan as being part of Bexley Riverside and has continued as a target for urban regeneration since at least 2011. Current applications include converting rail-side scrubland into modern housing. Nature conservation at Crayford Ness requires Bexley council to normally resist developments that increase lorry traffic around Slade Green. The town is increasingly a mix of privately owned residential properties benefiting from short commuting times to the City of London. Local industry is confined to the site of the old works and areas adjacent to the large railway carriage depot. Various types of investors are attracted to Slade Green's unique combination of strategic rail infrastructure and close proximity to national road network via the M25 at the Dartford Crossing. Some commercial developments immediately outside Slade Green are influenced by London Assembly's Bexley Riverside Opportunity and Intensification Area. :For infrastructure investments in Slade Green and surrounding areas see the main Thames Gateway article Local governance Slade Green is in the electoral ward of North End in the UK Parliament constituency of Bexleyheath and Crayford.

Ofsted's report shows the larger Crayford Academy is a good school, with an increasing number of students at Slade Green making good progress. The nearest faith schools for this age group are operated by Trinitas Academy Trust. These primary schools include Christ Church (CofE), which Ofsted reports as outstanding, and St. Paul's (CofE) that has yet to be inspected. =Secondary= Slade Green Secondary School, later known as Howbury Grange, closed in 1992 and Bexley Council's Secondary Pupil Referral Unit closed in 2008. The nearest secondary schools are Haberdashers' Aske's Crayford Academy, Erith School, Dartford Grammar School, and Dartford Grammar School for Girls. :For education in Slade Green see the main London Borough of Bexley article Places of worship * St. Augustine's Church (Anglican) * Slade Green Christian Fellowship (Baptist) Geography Transport Residents are not currently entitled to use the local resident scheme for reduced toll charge at Dartford crossing.

They were founded in 2001 by Wiley shortly before the disbandment of UK garage crew Pay As U Go Cartel. The group have had two UK No. 1 singles, Good Times and Green Light, won an Urban Music Award, and between 2001 and 2012 they released five studio albums before entering an indefinite hiatus in 2013. Current member Wiley and former members Dizzee Rascal and Tinchy Stryder have gone on to be successful solo artists in the UK, with songs that have topped charts.  History  Inspired by the success of So Solid Crew, Wiley founded the UK garage crew Ladies Hit Squad alongside DJ Target and Maxwell D at the turn of the 21st century. At the same time, Plague, Slimzee, Geeneus, Major Ace and God's Gift were enjoying relative success with another garage crew called Pay As U Go Kartel. Geeneus, who also founded Rinse FM, invited both Wiley and Flowdan to join Pay As U Go. The group released their debut single, \\"Know We\\", in 2000. Two years later, Wiley, Flowdan, Jamakabi and Breeze recorded a song entitled \\"Terrible\\", which record stores perceived to be a follow-up to \\"Know We\\". Wiley decided he didn't want to release it under the Pay As U Go name, so Flowdan suggested the name Roll Deep: a homage to the phrase 'rolling deep', popular within bashment songs. Flowdan cites the introduction of Dizzee Rascal to Roll Deep and his subsequent popularity as the reason why Pay As U Go eventually disbanded and Roll Deep rose to prominence. The crew distributed a number of mixtapes and vinyl singles independently before being signed to a major label and releasing their debut album In at the Deep End in June 2005. Four singles were released from the album: \\"Heat Up\\", \\"The Avenue\\", \\"When I'm 'Ere\\" and \\"Shake a Leg\\". They won an Urban Music Award.the same year. In October 2006, Roll Deep participated in a project of Tate Modern museum where various groups and songwriters were invited to choose a work that inspired them from the gallery's collection of modern art and then write a track about it. Roll Deep's submission, Searching, was inspired by the Anish Kapoor sculpture Ishi's Light, and can be heard on headphones in front of the work or on the Tate Tracks website. Their second album Rules and Regulations was released in 2007, followed by the release of Return of the Big Money Sound in 2008. The group got their first UK No. 1 single with the song \\"Good Times\\" in May 2010 and the group's second UK No. 1 single was \\"Green Light\\" in August 2010. Their next single was \\"Take Control\\", featuring R&B; singer Alesha Dixon, which charted at No. 29 on 7 November 2010. Roll Deep released their next single \\"Picture Perfect\\" (produced by Agent X) peaking at No. 19 in the indie charts. Roll Deep have appeared on BBC 1Xtra on numerous occasions. Members that appeared on the show include Wiley, Scratchy, Flowdan, Breeze, Brazen, Riko and Manga. In later years the group's work began to take a more mainstream oriented approach which led to members such as Riko and Flowdan becoming less active within the crew. In March 2014 Flowdan confirmed in an interview on Rinse FM the group's current hiatus and discussed the lack of drive from other members to work on music collectively. However many members of the crew are still active as solo artists and none have ruled out a return to writing music together in the future. In August 2018, DJ Karnage, Breeze, Manga, Brazen, Scratchy, Riko Dan and Flowdan all appeared at Riko Dan's Hard Food EP launch party, collectively billed as Roll Deep on the lineup. Later the same month, Manga told Grime.com: \\"We've got tunes, but it just takes long to organise. We've got new songs ‚Äî or we had new songs ‚Äî I don't know where they are, I think Wiley's got them somewhere. But we've started about three [new] Roll Deep albums between us, but... oh, it's just long to get everyone together, man. Wiley lives in Cyprus, Target's on radio everyday, Flowdan's doing shows everyday, J2K's making restaurants and creps and all these type of ting there.\\" In August 2019, Scratchy and Flowdan appeared as Roll Deep on \\"Don't Lie\\", featuring Jammer and taken from his Lord of the Mics VIII compilation album.

The village is the largest settlement in the civil parish of Pill and Easton-in-Gordano (until 2011 named Easton in Gordano). The former hamlets of Lodway and Ham Green are now contiguous with Pill, and the village of Easton in Gordano is nearby. The parish extends northwest beyond the M5 motorway to include the Royal Portbury Dock. History The name \\"Pill\\" comes from the Welsh word P√Æl which denotes a tidal inlet or harbour. The later name Crockerne Pill (literally 'pottery wharf') arose from the fact that an industrial-scale pottery thrived nearby. The Ham Green Pottery kiln was excavated about 50 years ago and is located in the fields above Chapel Pill. The pottery was made in the period from 1100 AD to 1250 AD and was exported from Pill by boat. The so-called 'Ham Green' pottery has been found and identified in archaeological digs from the Algarve in Portugal to Iceland. It is an important archaeological 'dating tool' because the period of manufacture is so precise. Bristol City Museum has a good selection of pottery artifacts from the site and other locations showing the unique decoration and form of Ham Green pottery but the only item on display is a large jug at the M Shed. The town was traditionally the residence of pilots, who would guide boats up the Avon Gorge, between the Bristol Channel and the Port of Bristol. The port moved in the 20th century to Avonmouth and the Royal Portbury Dock. Pill was once home to 21 public houses and was known as being a rough place, to the extent that the founder of the Methodist Church, John Wesley, says in an entry in his journals for 3 October 1755: The Portishead Railway viaduct in Pill. The 1860s saw the building of the Portishead Railway line between Bristol Temple Meads and Portishead. The line, which was opened to passengers in 1863, passed right through the village of Pill, with the result that a large number of buildings had to be demolished to allow its necessary straight and level passage. The railway also consumed many acres of farm land during its construction. However, it brought new life to the area, not to mention new blood as many of the navvies working the line met and married local girls and stayed on to raise their families after the line was completed. They brought new names, some of which are still with us today, over 100 years on. The small ferry from Pill to Shirehampton closed because of loss of trade once the opening of the Avonmouth Bridge in 1974 enabled pedestrians to walk over the Avon. So a transport link to and from the parish of Easton-in-Gordano, one that had survived since Medieval times, was closed and the river mud has swallowed up most of the now unattended slipways. The village and its vanished ferry are commemorated in the Adge Cutler and The Wurzels song \\"Pill Pill\\". In 1971 the Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed an inshore lifeboat at Pill. It was withdrawn in 1974. Amenities The parish has four places of worship: St George's, Easton-in-Gordano; Christ Church, Pill; The Salvation Army and Pill Methodist Church. Pill has several shops in the centre for day-to-day needs, including a Southern Co-operative food store, pharmacy, Post Office and hair salon. Pill has several take-away restaurants; however, it can no longer boast 21 pubs and currently has only four: The Kings Head, The Star, The Duke and the Pill Memorial Club, although this excludes the nearby pubs in Easton in Gordano. It is commonly used as a place for commuting to Bristol as it has excellent transport links, being close to the M5 and Bristol. Pill marks the start of the National Cycle Network 33 (the Wessex Cycleway), which also takes in Clevedon, Weston-super- Mare, Bridgwater, Chard and Seaton. Clubs and Societies ‚Äì Easton-in-Gordano Table-Tennis Club (meets Thursday nights) has been running since 1956 when the Church Memorial Hall was opened. The Luncheon Club provides a weekly get together for the elderly on Thursdays at the Community Centre. The village is proud of all its community activities full details of which are included in the Community Diary held at the Resource Centre (Precinct). Governance An electoral ward with the same name exists. It has the same area and the population taken at the 2011 census was 3,525. Schools * St Katherine's School, located at Ham Green within Abbots Leigh parish, not actually in Pill, with approximately 1,000 students aged 11‚Äì18. * Crockerne Primary School, which is located in the village and caters for Nursery to Year 6 pupils. The school has one of North Somerset's first children's centres, officially opened on 1 July 2006, as well as a small, indoor, heated swimming pool and an active PTA. Trivia The Pill Ferry has been immortalised in the 2013 book by Shirehampton author, Mark Jones (writing as Philippa Perry), Tabitha Miggins: Ship's Cat (On the Pill Ferry). Preview. The book mentions the hobblers, Pill pilots and various of Pill's public houses, most especially The Duke of Cornwall, which overlooks the old ferry slipway. Bristol-based entertainer, the late Adge Cutler, wrote a song about Pill, which is still sung by his group The Wurzels. Ham Green Hospital Bristol Archives holds records of Ham Green Hospital (and its predecessor institutions) including medical officers' records, letter books, patient lists and patient registers (Ref. 38224) (online catalogue).

It was released on DVD in 2000 by Anchor Bay. Plot The film opens with shots of Klaus Kinski performing, after his own interpretation, the role of Jesus. Kinski harangues the audience for not paying attention to him, curses wildly, has the microphone taken away from him, and, screaming, steals it back. Kinski left one of his Jesus tours to star in Herzog's film Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972). This was the first of five films that the two would make together, the others being Nosferatu the Vampyre (1978); Woyzeck (1978); Fitzcarraldo (1982); and Cobra Verde (1987). Herzog tours a substantially renovated apartment that he and his family shared with Kinski and other boarders, looks at the first film clip he ever saw of Kinski, and presents footage from the sets of their various movies. He recounts the heated and sometimes violent altercations between them, including the oft-repeated story of how he threatened to shoot Kinski should he leave the production of Aguirre. He also draws on footage from Burden of Dreams (1982), a documentary about the making of Fitzcarraldo, which was a particularly difficult film for their relationship. At the same time, Herzog expresses a deep respect for Kinski's acting talent. Interviews with two of the women who starred opposite him, Eva Mattes (from Woyzeck) and Claudia Cardinale (from Fitzcarraldo), suggest that the actor had a calmer side. The final sequence in the film shows Kinski playing with a butterfly in the Peruvian jungle. Herzog describes Kinski's death as the result of having lived so strenuously and fully, describing him as \\"like a comet\\". His voice is heard over the final scene of Cobra Verde, in which Kinski collapses in the surf as he tries to pull a large boat out to sea. Critical reception The documentary was screened out of competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. It has an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

As of February 2018, its products were in use at more than 27,000 facilities around the world. The company had more than 28,000 employees globally, with over 13,000 in Kansas City, Missouri. Its headquarters are in the suburb of North Kansas City, Missouri. History Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet. It went public in 1986.\\"International Directory of Company Histories\\", Vol. 16. St. James Press, 1997 Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems. During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system. In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company's software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005 from $245.1 million in 1997. Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies, and wellness programs. In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company and Patterson became the company's president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer. In September 2013, Zane Burke was named president, assuming the title from Patterson. On August 5, 2014, Cerner announced its intent to purchase Siemens Health Services, the health information technology business of Germany's Siemens AG, for $1.3 billion. The acquisition was completed on February 2, 2015. On July 29, 2015, Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leidos, was awarded a 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records for the Department of Defense. CEO and co-founder Neal Patterson died July 9, 2017. On January 10, 2018, Brent Shafer was named Chairman and CEO and took over leadership responsibilities in February 2018. In July 2019, Cerner announced that it would partner with Amazon Web Services. On September 4, 2019, Cerner laid off 255 employees as part of an ongoing cost-cutting effort and reorganization. In February 2020, Cerner sells off parts of healthcare IT business in Germany and Spain to German company CompuGroup Medical SE for EUR 225 million (USD 247.5M).Cerner Sells Off Parts of Healthcare IT Business in Germany and Spain for $248M, hitconsultant.net. In 2020, Cerner announced the hire of three new C-suite executives including Jerome Labat as chief technology officer (CTO), Darrell Johnson as chief marketing officer (CMO) and William Mintz as chief strategy officer (CSO).

Controversy In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an \\"Associate Center,\\" and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days. In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.Reed Abelson and Julie Crewswell, In 2nd Look, Few Savings From Digital Health Records\\", The New York Times, January 11, 2013. =Canada= In 2016, the Nanaimo BC hospital ER began using the system.

Longman wrote, \\"According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population‚Äîthose brought by emergency transport from other facilities‚Äîmore than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward.\\"Phillip Longman, \\"Code Red\\", Washington Monthly, July/August 2009, Retrieved 2018-04-28 Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system because it had simultaneously modified its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They stated that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems. In 2010, Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011, notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner.

It is made of bevelled stones of black basalt (\\"sampietrini\\"), placed one next to the other. The earliest examples were made by trimming large blocks that had been used in ancient Roman roads, recently discovered in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century archaeological excavations. The first documented use in Rome of \\"sampietrini\\" stones was during the reign of Pope Pius V (1566-72). Over the next two centuries the stones were used to pave all the main streets of Rome, because this mode was superior to brick, for example by providing a smoother and stronger surface for carriages, among other reasons. Its good points are: * it leaves small channels in between the individual bricks for water to pass through * it easily adapts to the irregularities of the ground * it is a strong material * after it has been laid down, it remains firm for a long time Its negative points are: * the ground becomes irregular over time * if wet, it can become very slippery Because of its peculiarities, the sampietrini are not suitable for streets where traffic travels at high speed. Nowadays its use is largely confined to historical or very narrow streets in the centre of Rome (in Trastevere for example), where the traffic is light and slow. The widespread availability of sampietrini have also made it a weapon of choice in Italian riots since the 1960s. In July 2005 the mayor of Rome Walter Veltroni declared that the Sampietrini pavement was causing several problems: its irregularity could be dangerous for people riding mopeds or any two-wheeled vehicles; moreover big vehicles passing on it are very noisy and cause wide vibrations that can damage the surrounding buildings. Even though it was argued that these problems are caused by inadequate maintenance, Veltroni said that, from now on, the Sampietrini will be removed wherever possible, keeping them only in pedestrianised areas and characteristic streets.

He produced a succession of undefeated America's Cup defenders between 1893-1920. Biography Herreshoff was born on March 18, 1848 in Bristol, Rhode Island and was named after General Nathanael Greene. He was one of seven brothers, behind Lewis and John B., and the elder of John B. F. and Julian L. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1870 with a three- year degree in mechanical engineering. After graduation, he took a position with the Corliss Steam Engine Company in Providence, Rhode Island. At the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he oversaw operation of the Corliss Stationary Engine, a , dynamo that powered the exhibition's machinery. In 1878 Herreshoff returned to Bristol where he and his older brother John B. formed the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company. Herreshoff provided the engineering expertise and his brother provided the business expertise, managing the firm's personnel and interacting with clients. Together, they grew the business from about 20 employees to over 400. In 1888, a serious accident occurred while Herreshoff was supervising speed trials of a , steamboat named Say When. After a safety valve opened to release over- pressure, Herreshoff closed it so the boat could achieve its anticipated maximum speed. But a boiler exploded, fatally injuring a member of the crew. Consequently, Herreshoff lost his steam engineer's license. Herreshoff was an accomplished sailor, and was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011. Two of Herreshoff's sons, Sidney Dewolf Herreshoff and Lewis Francis Herreshoff, also became yacht designers. He died on June 2, 1938 in Bristol, Rhode Island. Yacht building New York 30 class design Reliance ahead of Shamrock III, Sir Thomas Lipton's 1903 America's Cup contender designed by William Fife While the firm's early work centered on steam-powered vessels, by the 1890s the Herreshoffs turned to the design and construction of yachts for wealthy American clients, including Jay Gould, William Randolph Hearst, John Pierpont Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt III, Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, William Kissam Vanderbilt II, Harry Payne Whitney and Alexander Smith Cochran. Herreshoff boat production incorporated power tools that increased productivity at a high level of quality, using craftsmen that received the highest boat-builder wages in the state of Rhode Island. Herreshoff was noted as an innovative sailboat designer of his time. His designs ranged from the 12¬Ω, a 16-foot (12¬Ω foot waterline) sailboat for training the children of yachtsmen, to the 144-foot America's Cup Reliance, with a sail area of 16,000 square feet. He received the first US patent for a sailing catamaran. The firm built the America's Cup winning Cup yachts Enterprise - 1930, and Rainbow - 1934 (designed by Starling Burgess). Every winning America's Cup Yacht from 1893 to 1934 was built by the Herreshoff yard. The 123-foot Defender featured steel-framing, bronze plating up to the waterline and aluminum topsides to achieve a lighter and faster boat. This combination of materials had been pioneered in the French fresh-water racing yacht Vendenesse, which had been described in a New York Times article and caught the attention of the Vanderbilt Americacup syndicate. In salt water, Defender was subject to galvanic corrosion, which limited its durability in water. Defender won the America's Cup in 1895 over Lord Dunraven's Valkyrie III, and she was used as an effective trial-horse for Herreshoff's new Cup defender Columbia in 1899. She was broken up in 1901. Those of the 2,000-plus designs by Herreshoff that survive are sought by connoisseurs of classic yachts. Herreshoff S-Class sailboats, designed in 1919 and built until 1941, are still actively raced in Narragansett Bay, Buzzards Bay and Western Long Island Sound (Larchmont, New York). His 12¬Ω design of 1914 is still being built and raced in New England as well. The New York 30 is well regarded as a one-design racer/cruiser.

No. 189,459). The craft, Amaryllis, raced at her maiden regatta on June 22, 1876 and performed exceedingly well. Her debut demonstrated the distinct performance advantages afforded by catamarans over the standard monohulls. It was as a result of this event, the Centennial Regatta of the New York Yacht Club, that catamarans were barred from regular sailing classes, and this remained the case until the 1970s. *Amaryllis‚ÄîHerreshoff sailing catamaran, 1876 *Duplex catamaran, 1877 *Westward - racing yacht, 1910 * Helianthus III, 1924 * Herreshoff Bull's Eye * Herreshoff 12¬Ω =America's Cup yachts= Herreshoff designed and built the following America's Cup contenders.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations outline a formal process for assessing hazardous waste sites and placing them on the NPL. The NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites are so contaminated as to warrant further investigation and significant cleanup. Of the 40,000 federal Superfund sites across the country, approximately 1,600 are on the NPL. The vast majority are shorter-term cleanups that are not listed on the NPL. The federal Superfund program was originally funded by a tax on oil companies. In 1995, Congress chose not to renew the tax and currently taxpayers pay for the cleanup of sites where there are no financially viable responsible parties. Process for listing NPL sites The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), also known as \\"Superfund\\", requires that the criteria provided by the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) be used to make a list of national priorities of the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants in the United States.United States. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Sec. 105(a)(8)(B); This list is Appendix B of the National Contingency Plan, known as the \\"National Priorities List.\\" Hazardous waste sites become eligible for CERCLA/Superfund cleanup when EPA receives a report of a potentially hazardous waste site from an individual, state government, or responsible federal agency. EPA will first enter the potentially contaminated facility into a database known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS). Then, either EPA or the state in which the potentially contaminated facility is located will conduct a preliminary assessment, which decides if the facility poses a threat to human health and/or the environment. If the preliminary assessment shows the possibility of contamination, EPA (or the state under agreement with EPA) will conduct a more detailed site inspection. EPA then uses the HRS to review any available data on the site to determine whether its environmental or health risks are enough to qualify the facility for a Superfund NPL cleanup. Generally, facilities with overall scores of 28.50 and greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL. Another way facilities can be included in the NPL is if a state or territory designates one top-priority site within its jurisdiction, regardless of the site's HRS score. The last way a site can be included in the NPL is if it meets the following three requirements: # The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has issued a health advisory that recommends removing people from the facility. # EPA determines that the site poses a significant threat to public health. # EPA believes that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority (which is only available at National Priorities List facilities) than to use its emergency removal authority in responding to the facility. EPA may delete a final NPL site if it determines that no further response is required to protect human health or the environment. Also, sites where a remediation was completed through the Superfund program are typically deleted from the list. As of July 31, 2010, there are 1,277 sites listed on the NPL. Since its inception in 1980, an additional 343 have been delisted, and 61 new sites were proposed as of 2010.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. \\"National Priority List Site Totals by Status and Milestone.\\" As of 2010-07-30. The primary cleanup goal is to reduce the risks to human health and human health in the environment through a combination of cleanup, engineered controls like caps and site restrictions such as groundwater use restrictions. A secondary goal is to return the site to productive use as a business, recreation or as a natural ecosystem. Identifying the intended reuse early in the cleanup often results in faster and less expensive cleanups. EPA's Superfund Redevelopment Initiative provides tools and support for site redevelopment. Public comment process The public has the opportunity to comment on facilities that are proposed to be added to the National Priorities List. EPA publishes notices in the Federal Register listing the proposed facilities. The agency will consider all comments received within 60 days after publication in the Register. The complete set of comments are available to the public one week following the close of the comment period. EPA makes a final listing of decisions after considering all the relevant comments that were received during the comment period.EPA. \\"National Priorities List: Public Comment Process.\\" 2010-05-10. EPA Superfund docket The Superfund docket contains the Hazardous Ranking System score sheets for each proposed facility, a documentation record for each facility that details the information used to compute the score, information for any facility affected by particular statutory requirements or EPA listing policies, and a list of documents referenced in the documentation record. Mapping System TOXMAP was a geographic information system (GIS) application from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the EPA Superfund Basic Research Program and the Toxics Release Inventory. The application was deprecated in December of 2019 by the Trump Administration. The NLM said in a statement that much of the information remained available from the original sources, and that thus the database could be removed; critics, such as the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, suggested it was part of a larger effort on the part of the administration to obfuscate the detrimental results of the rollback of Obama-era environmental regulations.

The Murutic languages are a family of half a dozen closely related Austronesian languages. The Murut can be found mainly in Sabah, Malaysia including in Sarawak, Malaysia, Brunei and Kalimantan, Indonesia.  Etymology  The literal translation of murut is \\"hill people\\".literal translation of Murut  Demographics  A large percentage of the Murut communities are in the southwest interior of Sabah, East Malaysia, specifically the districts of Keningau, Tenom, Nabawan and Beaufort along the Sapulut and Padas rivers. They can also be found inhabiting the border areas of Sarawak, (especially around the Lawas and Limbang areas, where they are also referred to as Tagal people), North Kalimantan (traditionally concentrated in Malinau and Nunukan) and Brunei. The Murut population in Brunei is mainly found in the sparsely populated Temburong district. They once supplied military might to the Sultans of Brunei. Their population has dwindled in recent years.Brunei: The Abode of Peace - Retrieved 20 April 2007 They are defined as one of the seven indigenous groups that are considered to be Bumiputera in Brunei. The Murut are divided between lowland (Timugon) and highland (Tagol) subgroups. They speak the Murutic languages, a branch of the Austronesian family. The Tagol Murut language serves as their lingua franca. Customs and religion The Murut were the last of Sabah's ethnic groups to renounce headhunting. As with the Iban of Sarawak, collecting heads of enemies traditionally served a very important role in Murut spiritual beliefs. For example, a man could only get married after he presented at least one head to the family of the desired girl. Murut tribeswomen at a head feast in Sarawak, Malaysia. The Murut were shifting cultivators of hill padi and tapioca, supplementing their diet with blowpipe hunting and with some fishing. They live in communal longhouses, usually near rivers, using the rivers as their highways. Most have now converted to Christianity, with about a fifth of the population being Muslims. However they still maintain their culture. Traditional dress for men was a jacket made of tree bark (Artocarpus tamaran), a red loincloth, and a headdress decorated with Argus pheasant feathers. Women wore a black sleeveless blouse and sarong, which fell just below the knees. Like most of the other indigenous groups in Sabah, the Murut decorated their clothing with distinctive beadwork and also made belts out of old silver coins. Another belt made of reddish-brown glass beads plus yellow and blue beads was hung loosely around the waist. Murut in traditional attire. Murut wedding or funeral feasts can last several days. Ancient Chinese jars hold a prominent status in Murut customs. Jars are also a place of spirits, and larger jars were formerly used as coffins. =Musical heritage= The Murut have a musical heritage consisting of various types of agung ensembles - ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs which act as drone without any accompanying melodic instrument.Matusky, Patricia. \\"An Introduction to the Major Instruments and Forms of Traditional Malay Music.\\" Asian Music Vol 16. No. 2. (Spring-Summer 1985), pp. 121-182. Murut also used bamboo as a musical instrument, by using bamboo to compose a songs. Some musical instrument like tangkung (similar to that of a guitar, except it has only two strings) is made from wood. Tangkung is usually played during their leisure time. =Antanum= Antanum was a famous and influential Murut warrior from Sabah who according to local oral history claimed to have supernatural powers.

Life Hauk was born the son of aka Erlend digre \\"the fat,\\" who died 1312.\\"Erlendur digre\\" occurs in a letter by Bishop √Årni √ûorl√°ksson of Sk√°lholt dated 1286, Diplomatarium islandicum, Vol. II, p.136-7.

Ulf the Squinter's son Jorunn had a daughter Thjodhild who became the wife of Erik the Red. (Landn√°mab√≥k Part II, Ch. XIX, loc. cit. and Ch.

Hauk may have been an illegitimate offspring, although the question of whether his mother was Erlend's \\"first wife or mistress\\" is an open speculation. At any rate it is clear Hauk had a stepmother at some point, since Jarngerd () is called Erlend's wife in the Landnamab√≥kJarngerd, descended from Egil Skallagrimsson, married to Erelend in: Landn√°mab√≥k Part II, Ch.

Hauk's father Erlend became lawspeaker (l√∂gma√∞r) of Iceland in 1287, went overseas in 1289, retired as lawspeaker and was awarded the Westfjords in 1290 or 1292 according to some sources.Dateline under Addendum II \\"Vi√∞rauki Melab√≥kar ennar √Ωngri\\", Islandinga s√∂gur, Vol. 1, p.340 Somewhere along, though not in his early years, Hauk was educated abroad in Norway, where \\"he owes his whole education\\".

Around 1301 he arrived in Norway, and served from 1303 to 1322 as lawspeaker () in Oslo and on the Gula Thing. Sometime after 1303, he is mentioned as being on the king's council.

Publication history The Beyonders were first mentioned in the team-up comic Marvel Two-in-One #63 (May 1980), by Mark Gruenwald and Jerry Bingham. The Beyonders received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #1. They also received an entry in Secret Wars Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse. An initially unrelated character called the Beyonder was tied to these older characters by Steve Englehart for his \\"Secret Wars III\\" story in Fantastic Four #318-319 (September‚ÄìOctober 1988). The Beyonder first appeared during the first Secret Wars, as a being that was stated to be the omnipotent embodiment of an entire separated multiverse. As he became self-aware, he recognized himself as the only person in his Universe. According to Englehart, an editor hated the character and ordered the Beyonder \\"removed\\" from the Marvel Universe. Englehart did as asked but has stated that he tried to exile the character with dignity. The character was retconned into a less powerful character, a self-aware Cosmic Cube inhabiting his own \\"dimension\\" because there was no matrix to hold his energy, with the explanation that other more powerful beings had exercised their powers on the Beyonder's behalf to ease his transition into self-awareness.\\"Secret Wars 3\\", Fantastic Four vol 1. #319. The Beyonder later underwent another retcon, briefly becoming a mutant inhuman, and after a last retcon is now considered to be a member of the alien race of the same name and is referred to as a \\"child unit\\" by the Beyonders.New Avengers vol. 3 #30 Fictional history The Beyonders are a race of extra-dimensional entities powerful enough to collect planets. Their nature is so alien that they are unable to leave their own dimension and for millennia were never observed by any being of the Earth dimension (apparently including even the near-omniscient Watchers themselves); to interact with the Earth dimension they must operate through agents. After becoming aware of the Earth, the Beyonders began studying the Marvel Multiverse with amusement and curiosity. They first came to the attention of Earthlings when they commissioned the alien Nuwali race to create the Savage Land as part of their study of evolution. Thousands of years later, the Beyonders created the Fortisquians as agents to observe other worlds, including Max.Fantastic Four #316 They eventually hired the Pegasusian alien race as agents, to tow Counter-Earth to the Beyonders' museum. When the High Evolutionary discovered the disappearance of Counter-Earth, alongside the Thing, Alicia Masters, Starhawk, Moondragon, and Her, the Evolutionary pursued the Beyonders to rescue his world. When the Evolutionary arrived at the Beyonders' planet museum, he himself reported that his mind snapped when he witnessed the scope of their powers and how effectively insignificant he was compared to these alien beings. It is this encounter that marks the beginning of the High Evolutionary's mental instability.Marvel Two-In-One #63 Every now and then the Beyonders would shunt a modicum of energy to the universe, allowing sentient beings to use them to create Cosmic Cubes‚Äîa practice they appear to have given up after the admonishments by Eternity and the Living Tribunal regarding the disruptive effect of these actions.Infinity War #4 One of these energy modicums would later develop sentience and take its name after its creators, the Beyonder.Fantastic Four #319 =Time Runs Out= When entire universes throughout the Multiverse began to collide with each other, with each universe's respective Earth being the points of impact‚Äîevents known as \\"incursions\\"‚Äîthe Avengers send Hank Pym to find answers at the start of the \\"Time Runs Out\\" storyline. Instead, he learns the incursions are being caused by the Beyonders, whom he also refers to as the Ivory Kings.New Avengers vol. 3 #29 (March 2015) Upon returning to Earth, he tells his fellow heroes that the Beyonders have killed the Living Tribunal along with all the Celestials, and every abstract entity (including Eternity, Infinity, Lord Chaos, Master Order, and the In-Betweener) as part of an experiment involving the destruction of all life throughout the Marvel Multiverse. Later, Rabum Alal reveals to Doctor Strange that the Beyonders are responsible for the accident that turned Owen Reece into the Molecule Man, the same accident that created the sentient energy modicum that would name itself \\"The Beyonder\\" after its creators. They created the Molecule Man as a singularity‚Äîidentical in every reality‚Äîto function as a \\"bomb\\" that would destroy its native universe. The purpose of their experiment was to eventually kill all of the Molecule Men at the same time, bringing an end to the multiverse. After discovering that they are unable to travel through time since they are constrained and restricted to their own sequential timeline, Doom, Strange and Molecule Man confront the Beyonders one last time.

The arrival of a handful of other survivors who recalled the truth shattered this illusion and began the conflict that would lead to the Multiverse's recreation.Secret Wars #6-9 (2015) Powers and abilities The Beyonders have been witnessed killing all of the Celestials in the Marvel multiverse at the same time, destroying abstract entities such as Eternity and Infinity, and three members of the race together managed to kill the Living Tribunal itself.New Avengers Vol. 3, issue 30 The Beyonders are what Doctor Doom calls \\"linear beings\\".

The prison was operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service until its closure at the start of 2014. It is a Grade II listed building. History Reading Gaol in 1844 HM Prison Reading was built in 1844 as the Berkshire County Gaol in the heart of Reading on the site of the former county prison, alongside the site of Reading Abbey and beside the River Kennet. Designed by George Gilbert Scott and William Boynthon Moffatt, it was based on London's New Model Prison at Pentonville with a cruciform shape, and is a good example of early Victorian prison architecture. The Pentonville Prison design of 1842 was based on the design of Eastern State Penitentiary of 1829 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was designed to carry out what was the very latest penal technique of the time, known as the separate system. As a county gaol, its forecourt served as the site for public executions, the first one in 1845 before a crowd of 10,000; after 1868 executions took place inside, the last one in 1913. It was used to hold Irish prisoners involved in the 1916 Easter Rising, for internment in both World Wars, as a borstal and for a variety of other purposes. Most of those interned during the First World War were of German origin but there were also Latin Americans, Belgians, and Hungarians. In 1969 the wing where the Irish had been held was demolished. In 1973 Reading was re-designated as a local prison, and around that time its old castle wall was removed. The building was designated as Grade II listed in 1978. In 1992 it became a Remand Centre and Young Offenders Institution, holding prisoners between the ages of 18 and 21 years. Accommodation at the prison consisted of a mixture of single and double occupancy cells, on three wings. There was also a residential unit (Kennet wing) of single occupancy cells for low-security 'open' prisoners. There were two education departments at the prison, one run by the Prison service and one by Milton Keynes College. The remand centre library was run by Reading Borough Libraries.  Closure  Cell occupied by Oscar Wilde, as seen during Reading's 2016 Year of Culture On 4 September 2013, it was announced that HM Prison Reading would close by the end of that year, and the prison formally closed in January 2014 under The Closure of Prisons Order 2014. There have been calls for the prison building to be preserved as a tourist attraction, and Reading Council have confirmed that they intend to retain the complex. In June 2014 it was proposed that the site could be converted into a theatre venue. However, in November 2015 it was announced by Chancellor George Osborne and Justice Secretary Michael Gove that the site was to be sold to housing developers. In May 2016 it was announced that the former prison would be made available as an arts venue for the Reading 2016 Year of Culture programme. In October 2019 the Ministry of Justice announced that the site was to be sold.

It is located 13 km east of Yogyakarta on the way to Prambanan temple, on the south side of the main road Jalan Solo between Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Administratively, it is located in the Kalasan District of Sleman Regency. History According to the Kalasan inscription dated 778 AD, written in Sanskrit using Pranagari script, the temple was erected by the will of Guru Sang Raja Sailendravam√ßatilaka (the Jewel of Sailendra family) who succeeded in persuading Maharaja Tejapurnapana Panangkaran (in another part of the inscription also called Kariyana Panangkaran) to construct Tarabhavanam, a holy building for the goddess (boddhisattvadevi) Tara. In addition, a vihara (monastery) was built for buddhist monks from the Sailendra family's realm. Panangkaran awarded the Kala√ßa village to sangha (buddhist monastic community).Soetarno, Drs. R. second edition (2002). \\"Aneka Candi Kuno di Indonesia\\" (Ancient Temples in Indonesia), pp. 41. Dahara Prize. Semarang. . According to the date of this inscription, Kalasan temple is the oldest of the temples built in the Prambanan Plain. Despite being renovated and partially rebuilt during the Dutch colonial era, the temple currently is in poor condition. Compared to other temples nearby such as Prambanan, Sewu, and Sambisari the temple is not well maintained. Architecture The giant Kala's head on the southern door One of the niches on the wall of Kalasan temple adorned with carvings of Kala giant and scene of deities in svargaloka The temple stands on square 14.20 meters sub-basement. The temple plan is cross-shaped, and designed as a twelve-cornered polygon. Each of four cardinal points has stairs and gates adorned with Kala-Makara and rooms measuring 3,5 square meters. No statue is to be found in the smaller rooms facing north, west, and south; but the lotus pedestals suggest that the rooms once contains statues of Bodhisattvas. The temple is richly decorated with buddhist figures such as the Bodhisattva and gana. The Kala Face above the southern door has been photographed and used by a number of foreign academics in their books to give an idea of the artistry in stone by Central Javanese artists of a millennia ago. Niches where the statues would have been placed are found inside and outside the temple. The niches adorned an outer wall intricately carved with Kala, gods and divinities in scenes depicting the svargaloka, celestial palace of the gods, apsaras, and gandharvas. The roof of the temple is designed in three sections. The lower one are still according to the polygonal shape of the body and contains small niches with statues of boddhisatvas seated on lotus. Each of this niches is crowned with stupas. The middle part of the roof is in octagonal (eight sided) shape. Each of this eight sides adorned with niches contains statue of a Dhyani Buddha flanked by two standing boddhisatvas.Soetarno, Drs. R. second edition (2002). \\"Aneka Candi Kuno di Indonesia\\" (Ancient Temples in Indonesia), pp. 45. Dahara Prize. Semarang. . The top part of the roof is almost circular and also have 8 niches crowned with single large dagoba. The octagonal aspect of the structure has led to speculation of non-buddhist elements in the temple, similar to some interpretations of the early Borobudur structure. The temple is facing east, with eastern room also served as access to main central room. In the larger main room there is lotus pedestal and throne carved with makara, lion, and elephant figure, similar to the Buddha Vairocana throne founds in Mendut temple. According to the Kalasan inscription, the temple once houses the large (probably reaching 4 meters tall) statue of the Boddhisattvadevi Tara. By the design of the throne, most probably the statue of the goddess was in seated position and made from bronze. Now the statue is missing, probably the same fate as bronze Buddha statue in Sewu temple, being looted for scrap metal over centuries. On the outer wall of the temple found the traces of plaster called vajralepa (lit: diamond plaster). The same substance also founds in nearby Sari temple. The white-yellowish plaster was applied to protect the temple wall, but now the plaster has worn off. The temple is located on archaeologically rich Prambanan plain. Just a few hundred meters north east from Kalasan temple is located Sari temple. Candi Sari most probably was the monastery mentioned in Kalasan inscription. Further east lies the Prambanan complex, Sewu temple, and Plaosan temple.

Originally built by and for Food Circus grocery store, which later became known as the regional supermarket Foodtown, it is now a roadside display and de facto advertising sign for a nearby Spirits Liquors. Much of the clown's notoriety stems from its sinister-looking face, which might be described as bearing a vaguely amused sideways scowl. History It was originally constructed in 1956 by Joseph Azzolina to advertise his Food Circus grocery store (the predecessor to today‚Äôs Foodtown supermarket chain). In its early years it rotated continuously by electric motor, a then-common ad gimmick that went out of style (or economic practicality) by the mid-1970s or so. The clown has long since been fixed in place. The clown is the work of Road Ad Sign Company painter Leslie Worth Thomas who also created the mural Tillie, at the Palace Amusements building in Asbury Park. One hand of the figure originally held a sort of fool's scepter tipped with a pom-pom or ball; the rod at one point was painted out, with the \\"ball\\" now treated as a kind of badge or sign-within-a-sign. The giant clown‚Äôs slyly sinister grin and blood- red tipped index finger have earned it the nickname the \\"Evil Clown of Middletown\\" in popular culture. The moniker was perhaps first coined by local author Doug Kirby, of Roadside America fame, who grew up in the area and remembers marveling at the odd icon from an early age. Uncertain future In 1993, the township began exploring the idea of a major redevelopment in the area where the Clown stands. Dubbed \\"Middletown Center,\\" it would feature up to of retail space; of office space; 4500 parking spaces, 4 single family homes; 220 townhouses and apartments; and set aside space for a school to be leased to the Township. To date, the project has been delayed numerous times due to public outcry over increased traffic and the destruction of the only open space property in the township. In 2015, the project again came up and has begun to show promise after a 2009 New Jersey Supreme Court declined to hear appeals by the Middletown Township government challenging the project. To date, several campaigns have sprung up in effort to save the roadside attraction from destruction. Proponents of the sign have recommended incorporating it into the project or moving it to another site. Popular culture The clown's first starring role was in the opening sequence of the Philip Botti 1996 movie Middletown. The movie won the New York Underground Film Festival Choice award. It has been featured in the local New Jersey magazine Weird NJ, as well as on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in a Kevin Smith short. There is a deleted scene in the 2000 film Vulgar (produced by Kevin Smith), in which the main character is still traumatized after being raped and just stands next to the Clown of Middletown, depressed. The Evil Clown also appears in the first few minutes of Smith's 2006 film Clerks II.

Gilt-bronze fronts, wrought iron behind An andiron or firedog, fire-dog or fire dog is a bracket support, normally found in pairs, on which logs are laid for burning in an open fireplace, so that air may circulate under the firewood, allowing better burning and less smoke. They generally consist of a tall vertical element at the front, with at least two legs. This stops the logs from rolling out into the room, and may be highly decorative. The other element is one or more low horizontal pieces stretching back and serving to hold the logs off the bottom of the fireplace.Plummer, 4; Osborne, 341 An andiron is sometimes called a dog or dog-iron. Before the Renaissance, European andirons were almost invariably made entirely of iron and were of comparatively plain design. Indeed, andirons and firebacks were one of the first types of object to be commonly made in cast iron, a trend which in England began in the 1540s: until the nineteenth century cast iron was too brittle for many uses, but andirons carried light loads and this was not a problem.Osborne, 341 However, from the Renaissance onwards the front vertical element was increasingly given decorative treatment, and was in a different metal, such as brass, bronze or silver, which allowed casting, hugely increasing the range of decorative possibilities. When metals that could be cast began to be used for the fronts, these ordinary objects of the household received the attention of the artist, and had skill and taste lavished upon them. Thus English late 17th-century andirons often have elaborate flat brass front pieces, often in openwork and sometimes using enamel for further decoration. By the eighteenth century classical forms with several mouldings, similar to those used for candlesticks and the like, predominate in pieces for the middle classes, and were imitated in the American colonies, often just in iron and rather more simply. Small figures at the front also became popular; in America cast flat \\"Hessian\\" soldiers were a long-lasting favourite.Plummer, 4-9 In Continental Europe, men such as Jean Berain, whose artistry was most especially applied to the ornamentation of Boulle furniture, sometimes designed them. The Algardi Firedogs commissioned from the Roman sculptor Alessandro Algardi for Philip IV of Spain by Velasquez in 1650 were copied in several foundries. The andiron reached its greatest artistic development under Louis XIV of France. From the eighteenth century, fireplaces increasingly had built-in metal grates to hold the firewood, or, increasingly, the coal, up off the floor and in place, thus largely removing the need for andirons.Osborne, 341 However, andirons were often still kept for decorative reasons, and sometimes as a place to rest pokers, tongs and other fire implements. In older periods andirons were used as a rest for a roasting spit; and sometimes included a cup-shaped top to hold porridge. Sometimes, smaller pairs were placed between the main andirons for smaller fires. These are called \\"creepers\\".Osborne, 341 Usage American iron firedogs, 1770‚Äì1800. Hessians at 3rd from left Andirons and fire dogs are devices made of metal and (rarely) ceramic which support the firewood. They normally stand upon short legs and are usually connected with an upright guard. The guard keeps the logs in the fireplace as they burn and settle. This guard, which may be of iron, steel, copper, bronze, or silver, may be simple, or elaborately ornamented (often with patterns or heraldic ornaments, such as the fleur-de- lis, with sphinxes, grotesque animals, mythological statuettes, or caryatides supporting heroic figures or emblems). A common decoration in the form of a canine plays on the dual meanings of the word dog (canine and inanimate holder or blocker). Etymology Pair of French Rococo andiron fronts, with boars heads. Gilt bronze. The word andiron was borrowed into Middle English from the Old French word andier (also found in medieval Latin in forms such as andena, anderia, anderius). The origin of the French word is uncertain. But in English the word soon became associated with the word iron through folk-etymology, producing the form andiron. Sometimes this was further folk-etymologised as hand-iron. Due to the reanalysis of the French form l'andier ('the andiron') as one word, the French term later became landier, giving rise to English forms such as landiron.\\"andiron, n.\\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, March 2019, https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/7308. Accessed 25 April 2019. The term firedog seems to arise from the perceived similarity of an andiron to a dog lying by the fire. In English, however, this form may also have been influenced by French: another French term for an andiron is chenet, which originally meant 'little dog'.\\"dog, n.1.\\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, March 2019, http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/56405.

History Pair of andirons, by Louis Comfort Tiffany, 1894, bronze, glass and iron, 63.5 x 38.1 x 88.9 cm Andirons, or fire dogs, had been in use by the Ancient Greeks, and were called krateutai (Greek: Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒµœÖœÑŒ±ŒØ).Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒµœÖœÑŒ±ŒØ; Liddell, Henry George, and Scott, Robert; A Greek-English Lexicon; on Perseus Excavations made on the Greek island of Santorini unearthed stone sets of firedogs used before the seventeenth century BC. In each pair of the supports, the receptacles to hold skewers or spits were found in equivalence, while the line of small openings in the base formed a mechanism to supply the coals with oxygen so that they remained alight during its use.To Vima (in Greek)]; 6-2-2011; picture 2. Fire dogs were also referred to as moon idols (or moon horns)German: Mondhorn in antiquity. They may also refer to an artifact-type of late Bronze Age Europe (c. 1300 to 800 BC). Typically made of clay, they have been found in areas of modern France, Switzerland and Germany; often associated with the Urnfield culture. This naming suggests that moon idols could have been used as andirons to build up fire dogs. In some cases, moon idols are a cult item of Early European Religions, resembling a pair of horns or crescent moons on a pedestal, and were variously interpreted as testifying to Bull worship, Moon worship, or as a holder for wooden logs to be used in a fire altar. Medieval andirons tended to be high, often with slots at the front for placing spits for roasting; in later periods similar styles remained in use in large kitchens. When the Italian Renaissance began to produce very elaborate decorated fronts for reception rooms, these remained higher than later, gradually tending to reduce in height until the 18th century.Osborne, 341 Firedogs with little or no ornamentation and made of metal or ceramics were used in kitchens, with ratcheted uprights for the spits. Very often these uprights branched out into arms, or hobs, for stewing or keeping food hot.Fireplace Andirons from Fireplaces Magazine.

It served as one of the main detention facilities where Bosniak prisoners were beaten, tortured and the women sexually assaulted by Serbs during the Vi≈°egrad massacres in the Bosnian War of the 1990s. It is located about four kilometers north-east of Vi≈°egrad, in the village of Vi≈°egradska Banja.http://www.vilina-vlas.com/lokacija.php After the war, Vilina Vlas was re-opened as a tourist facility.  The camp  In 1992 the concentration and rape camp at the Vilina Vlas hotel was one of the Vi≈°egrad area's main detention facilities. It was established by the Uzice Corps at the end of April 1992 and played a significant role in the ethnic cleansing of the area's non-Serb population. The hotel served as a camp \\"brothel\\". Bosniak women and girls, including many not yet 14 years old, were brought to the camp by police officers and members of the paramilitary groups the White Eagles and Arkan's and Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj's men. Milan Lukiƒá, leader of a local group of paramilitaries referred to variously as the White Eagles, the Avengers or the Wolves, established his headquarters at the Vilina Vlas Hotel, one of various locations where local Bosniaks were detained. The group, with ties to the local police and Serb military units, played a prominent role in the ethnic cleansing of Vi≈°egrad, committing numerous crimes including murder, rape, torture, beatings, looting and destruction of property. Many rapes in the Vi≈°egrad area were allegedly perpetrated in an apparently systematic fashion. Reports to the United Nations Commission of Experts to the Security Council (the Bassiouni Commission) state that victims were rounded up and transported to places like Vilina Vlas and the Hotel Vi≈°egrad apparently for the purpose of being detained and raped. One report to the Bassiouni Commission estimated that 200 women, primarily Bosniak, were detained at Vilina Vlas and sexually assaulted. The hotel was known as a place where only young, beautiful women were detained and in testimony given to the Bassiouni Commission it is claimed that women brought to this camp had been chosen to bear \\"Chetnik\\" children and were \\"selected\\" carefully. It was claimed that younger girls were taken to the hotel while older women were taken to other locations, such as occupied or abandoned houses, and raped. The number and consistency of the reports were considered to provide reasonable confirmation that a large number of rapes did in fact occur at the hotel. The prisoners were raped repeatedly and beaten with batons. Many of the women were killed while others were exiled, became insane or took their own lives. Only a handful of the women prisoners survived ‚Äì fewer than ten according to the Association of Women Victims of War, an organisation which works with women survivors and campaigns for the prosecution of the perpetrators. Most of the women prisoners were either killed or took their own lives. The bodies of the victims have not been found and are alleged to have been buried in concealed locations and then reburied.https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/bosnia-and- herzegovina-no-justice-rape-victims-20090721 During the Sjeverin massacre, 16 Bosniaks were abducted by Milan Lukiƒá while travelling on a bus from Serbia to Bosnia and were taken to Vilina Vlas, where they were tortured and murdered. The camp was eventually closed once its existence became known outside Bosnia and the surviving detainees removed to an unknown fate. Trials Milan Lukiƒá was found guilty of having executing detainees kept at the camp. He was not charged with rape despite them being well documented. The President of the Association of Women Victims of War, Bakira Haseƒçiƒá, has severely criticised the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague for failing to include rape among the charges against Milan Lukiƒá when he was brought to trial. One woman survivor reported Lukiƒá raping her several times while she was a prisoner at the hotel. Oliver Krsmanoviƒá was charged with the rape and grave sexual abuse of female Bosniak detainees at Vilina Vlas as well as for the massacre of 70 Bosniaks in the village of Bikavac. Risto Peri≈°iƒá, Chief of Police and Crisis Staff member, is alleged to have aided in the torture, rape, and execution of detainees at Vilina Vlas. Dusko Andriƒá, the director of Vilina Vlas, was reported as having been one of the perpetrators of rape at the hotel. Dusko Andriƒá is a pensioner still living in Vi≈°egrad. He has never been charged with any offences. Art and Culture A stay at Vilina Vlas during a visit to Vi≈°egrad inspired the Australian performance artist Kym Vercoe's work \\"seven kilometres north-east: A performance about geography, tourism and atrocity\\".

During a National Basketball Association (NBA) career that spanned from 1993 to 2006, he played for the Denver Nuggets, Washington Wizards and Los Angeles Lakers and was a key member of the Utah Jazz, helping them reach back-to-back NBA finals appearances in 1997 and 1998. Russell also played for the Hollywood Fame and Long Beach Breakers of the American Basketball Association (ABA). He finished his career with the Los Angeles Lightning of the International Basketball League (IBA), winning a championship in 2009. After playing three years of college basketball with Long Beach State University, Russell was drafted forty-fifth overall in the 1993 NBA draft by the Utah Jazz. From 1997 to 2000, he played in every regular-season game. He went to back-to-back NBA Finals with the Jazz in 1997 and 1998, but lost to the Chicago Bulls. Russell had his best season with the Jazz in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, when he averaged 14.1 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. After playing nine seasons for the Jazz, Russell signed with the Washington Wizards as a free agent for the 2002‚Äì2003 season. Russell then signed with the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent for the 2003‚Äì2004 season and made it to the 2004 NBA Finals but lost to the Detroit Pistons.

The referees did not call a foul on the play, and Russell later remarked, \\"Whether he pushed off or not, he was making that shot.\\" He and Jordan were teammates when they played for the Washington Wizards during the 2002‚Äì03 NBA season, which was Jordan's last. In 2009, Jordan mentioned Russell in his Hall of Fame induction speech, recalling an interaction they had during Jordan's first retirement in 1994: \\"[A]t this time, I had no thoughts of coming back and playing the game of basketball. Bryon Russell came over to me and said, 'Why did you quit? You know I could guard you.' ...

The film was re-released as Call It Murder by Screen Guild Productions (Guaranteed Pictures) in 1949 after Bogart became a star; he was given top billing, although he is present in few scenes and was credited eighth in the original release. Plot The movie begins at the murder trial of Ethel Saxon, a woman who shot her lover in a crime of passion. During the trial, Edward Weldon, the jury foreman, asks the defendant a question, which ultimately leads to a guilty verdict and a death sentence for her. The rest of film takes place on the evening of the execution, mostly in the Weldon home. Edward is dealing with the consequences of his role as foreman. Friends have come to the house to support the family. An unscrupulous journalist who has bribed Weldon's son in law is also in attendance. Weldon's daughter Stella is upset by the departure of her gangster boyfriend, Gar Boni, whom she met during the trial. The evening culminates at midnight in a sequence in which three scenes are cross cut together: the switch is pulled at the death house, a gun is fired apparently in Boni's parked car, and a press photograph is taken of Edward Weldon's reaction. Moments later, Stella returns home, under the impression that she has shot Gar Boni. Weldon, torn between love for his daughter and his past pronouncements about the rule of law, contacts the district attorney to come to the house. Cast *Sidney Fox ... Stella Weldon *O.P. Heggie ...

Bush signs into law the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) of 2004 in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building Tuesday, July 13, 2004. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA (Title I, Trade and Development Act of 2000; P.L. 106-200)Pub. L. 106-200 retrieved from the United States Government Printing Office website August 23, 2010 is a piece of legislation that was approved by the U.S. Congress in May 2000. The stated purpose of this legislation is to assist the economies of sub-Saharan Africa and to improve economic relations between the United States and the region. After completing its initial 15-year period of validity, the AGOA legislation was extended on 29 June 2015 by a further 10 years, to 2025. History Rosa Whitaker, who served as the first ever Assistant U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) for Africa in the administrations of Presidents William J. Clinton and George W. Bush took the final lead in developing and implementing the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) following nearly a decade of leadership on the part of activists such as Paul Speck at Environmental and Energy Institute, and lawmakers, including Congressman Jim McDermott (a former Foreign Service medical officer based in Zaire) and Senator John Kerry, both senior lawmakers in the area of international trade. AGOA was initially signed by President Clinton into law in May 2000. The legislation was reviewed again in 2015, and was renewed. The revisions made it easier to become eligible and focused on improving the future business environment in developing African countries. Eligibility The legislation authorized the President of the United States to determine which sub-Saharan African countries would be eligible for AGOA on an annual basis. The eligibility criteria was to improve labor rights and movement toward a market-based economy. Each year, the President evaluates the sub-Saharan African countries and determines which countries should remain eligible. Countries' inclusion has fluctuated with changes in the local political environment. In December 2009, for example, Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger were all removed from the list of eligible countries; by October 2011, though, eligibility was restored to Guinea and Niger, and by June 2014, to Madagascar as well. Notice was given that Burundi would lose its AGOA eligibility status as of 1 January 2016. In August, 2017, Togo was recognized as an eligible country. Having AGOA eligibility does not imply automatic eligibility for a \\"Wearing Apparel\\" provision. To export apparel and certain textile to the United States under the AGOA duty-free, an eligible country must have implemented a \\"Visa System\\" that satisfies American authorities and proves compliance with the AGOA Rules of Origin. Benefits and results AGOA provides trade preferences for quota and duty-free entry into the United States for certain goods, expanding the benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. Notably, AGOA expanded market access for textile and apparel goods into the United States for eligible countries, though many other goods are also included. This resulted in the growth of an apparel industry in southern Africa, and created hundreds of thousands of jobs. However, the dismantling of the Multi Fibre Agreement's world quota regime for textile and apparel trade in January 2005 reversed some of the gains made in the African textile industry due to increased competition from developing nations outside of Africa, particularly China. Some factories shut down in Lesotho, where most of the growth occurred. Orders from African manufacturers stabilised somewhat after the imposition of certain safeguard measures by U.S. authorities, but Africa's share of the U.S. market was still reduced after the phaseout. AGOA has resulted in limited successes in some countries. In addition to growth in the textile and apparel industry, some AGOA countries have begun to export new products to the United States, such as cut flowers, horticultural products, automotive components and steel. While Nigeria and Angola are the largest exporters under AGOA, other countries, particularly South Africa's have been more diverse and unlike the former are not mainly concentrated in the energy sector. To some countries, including Lesotho, Swaziland, Kenya and Madagascar, AGOA remains of critical importance. Agricultural products are a promising area for AGOA trade; however much work needs to be done to assist African countries in meeting U.S. sanitary and phytosanitary standards. The U.S. government is providing technical assistance to AGOA eligible countries to help them benefit from the legislation, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other agencies. The U.S. government has established three regional trade hubs in Africa for this purpose, in Accra, Ghana; Gaborone, Botswana; and Nairobi, Kenya. Initially, AGOA was set to expire in 2008, but the United States Congress passed the AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004, which extended the legislation to 2015. It has since been extended by 10 years from 2015 to 2025. The Act's apparel special provision, which permits lesser-developed countries to use foreign fabric for their garment exports, was to expire in September 2007. However, legislation passed by Congress in December 2006 extended it through 2012, and later to 2025 as part of the general AGOA extension in June 2015. Every year an AGOA Forum is held, which brings together government leaders and private sector stakeholders from Africa and the United States. The Forum is held in Washington every other year, and in an AGOA eligible African country in the other years. So far, the Forum has been held four times in Washington, and once each in Mauritius, Senegal, Ghana, Kenya (2009), Zambia (2011), Ethiopia (2013), Gabon (2015) and Togo (201).. Statistics suggest a positive balance of trade for AGOA participant countries. In FY2008, the United States exported $17,125,389 in goods to the 41 AGOA countries, and the U.S. imported $81,426,951 for a balance of $64,301,562 in favor of the AGOA countries. Criticism Tatah Mentan (2018) has argued that although it \\"sounds like a benevolent multilateral trade agreement\\" it is in reality a colonial scheme intneded to economically exploit Africa, stating that the profits made from the scheme are \\"not for Africans\\".Africa in the Colonial Ages of Empire (2018), page 453 Some allege that AGOA is in contradiction with WTO rules. Furthermore, it is seen as a one-sided agreement as there was little African involvement in its preparation. AGOA has also been criticized for being \\"dominated by oil and raw materials\\" After the enactment of AGOA, \\"exports have increased by more than 500 per cent from around $8.2 billion then to $54 billion in 2011, although about 90 per cent of these are natural resources, mainly oil,\\" wrote Andualem Sisay. AGOA contains a clause requiring participating African countries not to oppose US foreign policy.

The regiment fought at the Battle of Kilcullen, inflicting severe losses on the rebels, on 24 May 1798Cannon, p. 25 and at the Battle of Carlow on 25 May 1798, when they successfully ambushed the rebels, during the Irish Rebellion.Cannon, p. 26 The regiment also saw action at the Battle of Vinegar Hill on 21 June 1798.Cannon, p. 28 The regiment took part in Sir Samuel Auchmuty's disastrous expedition to the River Plate in October 1806, including the occupation of Montevideo in February 1807 during the Anglo- Spanish War.Cannon, p. 34 It then took part in the equally unsuccessfully Walcheren Campaign in autumn 1809: a total of 152 men from the regiment died of fever during that campaign.Cannon, p. 40 The regiment then embarked for Portugal and fought at the Battle of Arroyo dos Molinos, capturing General De Brune of the French Army, in October 1811 during the Peninsular War.Cannon, p. 43 It was also part of the covering force for the Siege of Badajoz in March 1812.Cannon, p. 44 In April 1813, the regiment returned to England.Cannon, p. 47 They were re-designated as a lancer formation in 1816 and became the 9th (or Queen's Royal) Lancers in honour of Queen Adelaide in 1830. Mutineers surprised by the 9th Lancers in 1857 The regiment was posted to India in 1842. It saw action at the Battle of Punniar in December 1843 during the Gwalior Campaign. It also fought at the Battle of Sobraon in February 1846 during the First Anglo-Sikh War and undertook a successful charge at the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. The regiment then fought at the siege and capture of Delhi and the relief of Lucknow in summer 1857, as well as the capture of Lucknow in spring 1858 during the Indian Rebellion: the regiment, which was described by the rebels as \\"the Delhi Spearmen\\", was awarded twelve Victoria Crosses. It was described by an ally as: > \\"The beau ideal of all that British Cavalry ought to be in Oriental > countries\\". The regiment was renamed the 9th (The Queen's Royal) Lancers in 1861. =Second Anglo-Afghan War= The 9th Lancers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Bushman on the march to Kandahar in autumn 1880, painted by Orlando Norie. The troops would march in the early morning to avoid the full heat of the sun, halting a few minutes every hour. In this way, the column managed to cover up to 20 miles a day. The regiment was posted to Afghanistan in 1878 and marched through the Khyber Pass in March 1879 as part of the cavalry brigade led by General Hugh Henry Gough. Following the murder of the British ambassador and his guards at Kabul in September 1879, the regiment saw action at the Battle of Charasiab in October 1879 during the Second Anglo- Afghan War. The commanding officer of the regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Cleland, was killed while leading a charge at the Battle of Killa Kazi in December 1879. Major-General Frederick Roberts described the ensuing events: > \\"The charge was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Cleland and Captain Neville, the > former of whom fell dangerously wounded: but the ground, terraced for > irrigation purposes and intersected by nullahs, so impeded our cavalry that > the charge, heroic as it was, made little or no impression upon the > overwhelming numbers of the enemy. The effort, however, was worthy and that > it failed in its object was no fault of our gallant soldiers.\\" A squadron from the regiment took part in the Second Battle of Charasiab in April 1880 and the regiment, as a whole, undertook the long march, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Bushman, leading to the relief of Kandahar and defeat of Ayub Khan in September 1880. =Second Boer War= During the Second Boer War, the regiment took part in the Battle of Belmont and the Battle of Modder River in November 1899, as well as the Battle of Magersfontein in December 1899, Relief of Kimberley in February 1900 and the subsequent Battle of Paardeberg which resulted in Piet Cronj√©‚Äôs surrender. After the war, the regiment returned to Sialkot in the Punjab. In the Delhi Durbar of January 1903, the Duke of Connaught specially selected an escort from the 9th Lancers. This was popular with the regiment, but not with all Indian spectators; the regiment had been forbidden to take part as punishment for refusing to disclose the murderers of an Indian cook. Before he died, the man had stated that his assailants were men of the 9th Lancers. It was suggested in the press that the assailants may actually have been unsuccessful applicants for the post of cook. The Viceroy, Lord Curzon, had insisted on a collective penalty being imposed on the 9th Lancers, partially to discourage drunken assaults by British soldiers on Indian camp-followers and partially from a sense of personal outrage at efforts made by officers to conceal the facts of this particular case.Mason, p. 393-394 The regiment was later reported to transfer from Sialkot to Rawalpindi, also in Punjab. =First World War= Richard Caton Woodville) 9th Lancers near Pr√©mont in 1918 The regiment landed in France as part of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade in the 1st Cavalry Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. Captain Francis Grenfell was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in saving the guns of 119th Battery, Royal Field Artillery on 24 August 1914 (he was later killed in action on 24 May 1915, as was his twin brother, Riversdale, a yeomanry officer who attached to 9th Lancers). The regiment then participated in the final \\"lance on lance\\" action involving British cavalry of the First World War; on 7 September 1914 at Montcel √† Fr√©toy in which Lieutenant Colonel David Campbell led a charge of two troops of B Squadron and overthrew a squadron of the Prussian Dragoons of the Guard. Memorial to the action by the 9th Lancers at Montcel √† Fr√©toy Memorial board in the cloisters of Canterbury Cathedral to the officers and men of the 9th (Queen's Royal) Lancers who died during the First World War =Inter-war= Light Tank Mk VIs of the 9th Lancers on manoeuvres at Tidworth, Wiltshire, 1938 The regiment was renamed the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers in 1921. It was deployed to Ireland and lost nine of its men in the Scramogue ambush of March 1921 during the Irish War of Independence.O'Malley p. 103 In addition to the lack of conflicts, their relative inactivity was also due to the military high command struggling to decide what role cavalry regiments could perform in modern warfare. Lances ceased to be carried by the six lancer regiments in the British Army for active service in 1928, though the impressive if archaic weapon was retained for ceremonial parades and guard duties. In the case of the 9th Lancers, lances were formally withdrawn in 1932, four years before they lost their horses.Barnes, p. 316 In the spring of 1938, the 1st Mobile Division, later to become the 1st Armoured Division, was formed: the 2nd Armoured Brigade, which included the 9th Lancers, was assigned to it. =Second World War= Sherman tanks of the 9th Lancers advance through the Gabes Gap, Tunisia, 7 April 1943 The Lancers landed in France to cover the retreating French, Belgian and British armies on 20 May 1940 and took part in the Battle of France. Withdrawn to England, the regiment landed in North Africa in September 1941 and undertook a leading part in the First Battle of El Alamein in July 1942. According to General Sir Richard McCreery: > \\"The 9th Lancers took part in many decisive battles, none more so perhaps > than the long withdrawal from Knightsbridge, south of Gazala, to El Alamein. > Many think that Egypt was saved when the Eighth Army defeated Rommel's last > big attack in the Western Desert at the end of August 1942. Actually, Egypt > was saved earlier during those first few critical days of July when Rommel > drove his tanks and self-propelled guns and trucks forward along the > Ruweisat Ridge in close formations, to be stopped by the 25-pounders and the > remnants of the 2nd Armoured Brigade with their \\"thin-skinned\\" Crusader > tanks. In this critical action the 9th Lancers took the principal part. > Throughout that long withdrawal from Knightsbridge, when the fluctuating > Battle of Gazala had finally swung against the Eighth Army, past Sollum and > Matruh to the Ruweisat Ridge, only seventy miles from Alexandria, the 2nd > Armoured Brigade with the 9th Lancers always there but often reduced to only > a handful of tanks, fought on skilfully and with gallant endurance and > determination. Egypt was then saved indeed and with the arrival of the 9th > Australian Division from Syria about the 6th of July, the tide of the whole > war was turned.\\"Bright, p. xv. McCreery went on: > \\"Right well did the intensive training of the 9th Lancers with the Sherman > bear fruit in the great battle which followed. As the world knows, the > breakthrough at El Alamein did not come quickly. Rommel had had two months > to build up defenses and minefields in depth. However, in the ten days \\"dog- > fight\\" tank crews with their new 75-mm guns were knocking out far more enemy > tanks than our infantry appreciated at the time.\\"Bright, p. xvi. The regiment's marksmanship was renowned; their best shot was Corporal Nicholls of B Squadron, who was once personally congratulated by General Bernard Montgomery for knocking out nine enemy tanks in one day. The regiment landed in Italy in mid-1944, where it saw action at San Savino in the battle for the Gothic Line in September 1944 on the Italian Front. The regiment formed the spearhead of the British Eighth Army in the breakthrough to the River Po in the Spring of 1945. By the end of War, 143 members of the regiment had lost their lives.Bright, pp. 287-289. =Post-war= The regiment moved to Glencorse Barracks, Edinburgh in December 1947 before deploying to Detmold, Germany in 1949. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother became Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment in June 1953. It then moved to Bhurtpore Barracks at Tidworth Camp in May 1960. The regiment was amalgamated with the 12th Royal Lancers to form the 9th/12th Royal Lancers in September 1960. Regimental museum The Derby Museum and Art Gallery incorporates the Soldier's Story Gallery, based on the collection, inter alia, of the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers.

This was Heisler's first of two features starring Bogart, the other was Chain Lightning that also wrapped in 1949 but was held up in release until 1950. Plot After World War II, ex-Colonel Joe Barrett returns to Tokyo to see if there is anything left of his pre-war bar and gambling joint (\\"Tokyo Joe's\\") after all the bombing. Amazingly, it is more or less intact and being run by his old friend Ito. Joe is shocked to learn from Ito that his wife Trina, who he thought had died in the war, is still alive. She has divorced Joe and is married to Mark Landis, a lawyer working in the American occupation of Japan. She has a seven-year-old child, Joe's daughter Anya, born when Trina was in an internment camp after Joe's departure from Japan just before Pearl Harbor. Joe starts up an air freight business, fronting for Baron Kimura, former head of the Japanese secret police. Joe believes Kimura will use the airline to smuggle penicillin and other drugs into the country, but discovers he actually intends to smuggle in fugitive war criminals - former senior officers of the Imperial Japanese Army and the leader of the Black Dragon Society - to start a secret anti-American movement. When he balks, Kimura kidnaps Anya to force him to comply. Joe rescues Anya and foils the baron's plot, but is seriously wounded in the ensuing struggle. Joe is carried out on a stretcher and the film ends without revealing whether he survives.

From 1937 to 1949, Hayakawa had been in France, first as an actor and then was caught up in the German occupation, living ostensibly as an artist, selling watercolors. After joining the French underground, he aided Allied flyers during the war. When Humphrey Bogart's production company tracked him down to offer him a role in Tokyo Joe, the American Consulate investigated Hayakawa's activities during the war before issuing a work permit.\\"The Legend: Sessue Hayakawa is the first Asian American superstar.\\" goldsea.com, 2009. Retrieved: January 1, 2009. Principal filming for Tokyo Joe took place from January 4 to the end of February 1949 on the Columbia Pictures studio lot, not on location in Tokyo, Japan. A second photographic unit was dispatched by Columbia to Tokyo to collect exterior scene shots and was the first movie company allowed to film in postwar Japan. The use of a Lockheed Hudson bomber converted into cargo hauling is featured with both interiors, and aerial sequences revolving around the aircraft. Reception The film fared well with the public as the subject of postwar Japan was an intriguing one featured in many of the headlines of the day. Most viewers were convinced that the film was a semi-documentary due to the extensive use of footage shot in Japan. The critics were less charitable, The New York Times contemporary review noted the juxtaposition of the footage as jarring: \\"a note of reality which is embarrassingly at odds with the major and markedly synthetic elements of the plot\\", further stating: \\"The big weakness of Tokyo Joe, however, is a script which does not neatly come together, but squanders its good points amidst a field of corn.\\"\\"Movie Review: 'Tokyo Joe' (1949) At the Capitol.\\" The New York Times, October 27, 1949.

It ran for 32 issues and an annual. It concerned a group of adolescents who had developed psionic powers following the \\"White Event\\" which had created most of the paranormals in the New Universe. These teens, along with federal agent Emmett Proudhawk, could pool their powers into a psychic construct called the \\"Psi-Hawk\\". The title includes some of the first comics work of writer Fabian Nicieza (#9, 13, 16-32) and artist Ron Lim (#16-22). Publication history Almost from the beginning, Psi-Force was one of the New Universe's most popular series. Danny Fingeroth, the regular writer from issue #3 through to #15, remarked that Fictional team biography Psi-Force was brought together by a paranormal named Emmett Proudhawk. Before the White Event, he worked for the CIA on a project investigating children with higher than usual ESP scores. After the White Event, he gained telepathic powers, including the ability to control others and project bolts of force. At the same time he began to have prophetic dreams. The dreams led him to gather those children who had higher ESP scores and had, after the White Event, developed new abilities. He compiled a list of names, which included all of the original members of the team, as well as Thomas Boyd. Of those, he was only able to find Tucker, Crawley, Jessup, Ling, and Inyushin. He visited the hometown of each teen and mentally compelled them to run away to San Francisco. Then he personally rescued Inyushin from a Russian project investigating paranormals and brought her to the United States. He was killed by a KGB agent code-named 'Mindwolf' (who was working for the Siberian Project, and also possessed psionic powers similar to Proudhawk's) shortly after gathering the Sanctuary kids together. When Mindwolf used his powers and attacked the teens, Tucker felt a mental compulsion to take Proudhawks's medallion. He had the others concentrate upon the medallion with him, and thus discovered they had a new ability - the creation of a gestalt entity known as the \\"Psi-Hawk\\". Psi-Hawk possesses the powers of all of those who combine their mental energy to make it, but magnified to a far greater degree than any of them could manage separately. Originally, it was thought that only the original five members could create it, but it was later discovered that Thomas Boyd could also contribute to it. Still later, Lindsey Falmon helped create it (who was neither on Proudhawk's list, nor did she have any memories of Proudhawk or Psi-Hawk). It has been created by as few as two and as many as six; however, on the one occasion more than five members participated, Psi- Hawk became dangerously unstable and began attacking those who created it until one of them fell unconscious. Any time a member wanted to leave the group and strike out on their own, they soon felt an irresistible mental urge to return (or, if they were able to withstand it, for the rest of the group to follow). This bound the group together, unwillingly, until Sanctuary was destroyed and they fled in several directions (although Crawley was able to leave earlier, so long as he was replaced by another member on Proudhawk's list), and never seemed to feel the compulsion. At the end of issue #24, Tucker, Jessup, Boyd, Ling, and Lindsey Falmon created the Psi-Hawk for the last time. This time, whether due to the group's relative experience, or because of the addition of Falmon's powers to the link, the five paranormals lost consciousness and actually controlled Psi-Hawk directly. In the fight with Rodstvow that ensued, Psi-Hawk was destroyed (although those creating it survived, falling into a coma). The series was noted for the characters more confrontational interactions with others, particularly authority figures. They came into conflict with many different groups which wanted to capture them including both the Soviet and American governments. Early issues of the book stressed the nature of the team as one of runaways. When Fabian Nicieza took over writing chores the stories began to focus more on the groups interactions with various paramilitary organizations. At one point, one of their number, Thomas Boyd, was drafted into the US military and the remaining members staged a raid on a US Army base to rescue him. Nicieza also introduced the shadowy Medusa Web organization, a group of mercenaries/terrorists who were occasional opponents and occasional allies of the group. Towards the end of the book's run Psi-Force spent some time at a Siberian training facility for Russian paranormals. When the Russian paranormal Rodstvow, who had been a repeated enemy of the group, showed up the teens teamed up with the Medusa Web and the Russians to combat him. After this the remaining members became operatives of the Medusa Web. In issue #32, the forward is that of a Playboy interview with Tucker (who is stated as being in hiding), which is dated 1998 - roughly ten years after the events of the issue. He reveals that Psi-Force has remained together as a team, and that Crowley has returned to the team. He is also asked about the condition of Johnny Do, after a well-publicized \\"incident at Los Alamos\\", and replies that he's injured, but still alive. Main characters =Original members= * Wayne Tucker - Also known as Network. Telepath, with the ability to push people into following his mental commands. * Michael Crawley - Known as Salvo and later Dynamite. The ability to cause explosions with his mind. He decides to leave the group for Thomas Boyd in the Annual, and later winds up at the Clinic for Paranormal Research. * Tyrone Jessup - Also known as Voyager. His ability is originally described as astral projection, but later discovered to be the projection of his consciousness into an unknown energy form with a specialized control of the electromagnetic spectrum. He is drafted into the United States Army after the death of Psi- Hawk, and he loses control of his powers. * Kathy Ling - Sometimes called Shockwave, but rarely used this name. Powerful telekinetic. She is initially very reluctant to use her powers, but she grows to like it. She leaves the group in the last issue, but it is implied she later returns. * Anastasia (Stasi) Inyushin - Healer. Stasi is a Russian national who has been illegally smuggled into the United States by CIA agent Emmett Proudhawk, and is highly sought after by her government. She dies in issue #24, from the strain of healing the rest of the team from near death. =Later members= * Thomas Boyd - Originally called Psi-Stalker. In Emmet Proudhawk's files, he is listed as 'Syphon'. Energy siphon/adrenaline vampire. Boyd has the ability to quickly exhaust the energy in a living organism, and can use his powers through a medium (such as fighting batons, or capture lines). In some ways, his power is the reverse of Inyushin, and her power can hurt him by forcing him to expend his own energy. He is originally enlisted to hunt down the team, but turns on his employer and, later, requests their help. He joins the team in the Annual. * Lindsey Falmon - Known as Overtime. Powers of psychometry. She starts a relationship with Tucker while he is on the run in Seattle, and later reveals she has her own powers, despite not being on Proudhawk's list. She runs away with him and, in the final issue, agrees to marry him. * Johnny Do/Dehman Doosha - Pyrokinetic. Johnny Do is highly autistic and was treated as a virtual animal in a Russian project investigating paranormals. Boyd was able to forge a connection with him and became his caregiver. \\"Johnny Do\\" is the name given to him by Boyd‚Äîhis real name and background prior to his capture by the Soviet government are unknown; Dehman Doosha (Demon Within) is what his captors called him. * Sedara Bakut - Teleporter. Sedara is a rebel in Afghanistan before she is recruited by Psi-Force in the final issue. She can create window-like portals to places she has been, or to places which have been put into her mind by another. She also has the ability to use her teleportation offensively, using the energy that creates the portal as some sort of force bolt. =The Medusa Web= The Medusa Web is a covert organization of mercenaries established well before the White Event. Its purpose at one point was said to be to save the world from itself by providing them an enemy for them to unite against. At the end of Psi-Force, the remaining members join the Medusa Web as an independent subgroup. *Babel (Thame Panagitis) - Leader, with the ability to understand every language, and for his words always to be understood in the language of the hearer's native tongue. His name is a reference to the Tower of Babel. *Backfire - Possesses the ability to reflect most attacks back on the attacker. Is a coward at heart, and carries only blanks in his sidearm because he once shot himself in the foot. *Donner Kopf - The ability to generate hypersonic energies with his voice through the use of mechanical implants. His name is German for \\"Thunderhead\\". *Electrique - Composed of living electricity. Electrique was dispersed and possibly killed by Jessup's \\"astral form\\". *Gatto di Sangue - Former Olympic gymnast who found her athletic ability increased dramatically after the White Event. Her name translates to \\"Bloodcat\\". Killed by Rodstvow during the battle near the Siberian Project. *Imprint - Able to transmit everything he sees and hears as electromagnetic impulses which can be recorded. He is essentially a human recording device, although he is mute. He has also shown the ability to interface with other people and record through them. *Potiphar - Non-paranormal mercenary. *Relampago - Gifted with superhuman speed. She was accidentally killed by Stasi while trying to capture her. Her name is Spanish for \\"Lightning\\". *Skybreaker - Possesses the power of flight, though he used exterior wings for stabilization and a large number of small arms for greater attacking range. *Troublemaker - Said to be quadruple- jointed, and able to move any of his joints in any direction. Troublemaker is also skilled in some form of martial arts. Also a gifted agent provocateur, Troublemaker is skilled in provoking others. =Crasniye Solleetsi= Crasniye Solleetsi is a fictional team of Soviet paranormals run by the KGB. The name Crasniye Solleetsi is Red Sun in corrupted Russian (The correct Russian term is Krasnoye Solntse/–ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–µ –°–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–µ). Characters names are in transcribed/corrupted Russian as well. At some point before the White Event, the Soviet Union established the Siberian Project in the Yamal Peninsula of Siberia. The goal of the project was to investigate people with reputed paranormal abilities, such as ESP, or unusual talents in other areas, including those with an exceptional green thumb.Psi-Force Annual #1 When the White Event struck, at least one of their subjects, Anastasia Inyushin, developed a full-fledged, provable paranormal ability, the ability to heal with a touch. Unfortunately for the Soviet government, CIA agent Emmett Proudhawk abducted the girl shortly afterwards.Psi-Force #1 Despite this, the Siberian Project had proved the existence of Paranormals and within two years had begun assembling a team of paranormals, under control of the KGB, to serve the country's interests. They weren't too picky about the members of this team, either, and included several people with psychological problems ranging from severe autism to complete insanity. One of the team's first missions was to assist the Soviet military in Afghanistan against the Mujahideen where they were able to push the rebels out of their stronghold.Psi-Force #20 Later, the members of Psi-Force were taken to the Siberian Project and Red Sun was among the forces to ensure they were kept in line. When Justice and the Medusa Web arrived to break Psi-Force free, Red Sun initially fought them, but they were forced to join forces against the threat of Rodstvow, who had gone completely mad and was destroying people indiscriminately.Justice #29, Psi-Force #30 *Coojeechiscue (Cubic): Field leader of Crasniye Solleetsi, she possesses the power to create cube-shaped force fields of varying sizes which can be used to either protect or contain people. Her first name is Nadehzda. *Rodstvow (Kinship, The People's Hero): Insane paranormal of extraordinary power, with the abilities of flight, energy projection, teleportation, molecular combustion, among others. He was once an artist, but descended into insanity when his power manifested after the White Event, causing the loss of several of his body parts. His family was also accidentally killed during his initial manifestation, after which the Soviet government took custody of him. His destroyed body parts were replaced with a specialized plastic-like substance in which his bio energy was able to retake human form. *Sillatochca (Force Point): Former mechanic with the ability to increase the pressure in objects with his mind, often causing them to explode. His power causes him severe migraines. Leonid Vishnevesky was blackmailed into the program with threats against his family, and is opposed to what he is made to do. Killed by Potiphar as he was helping Overtime escape the Siberian Project. *Shivowtnoeh (Animal): A Russian high school student named Irina Mityushova, she began a bestial transformation shortly after the White Event. She possesses superhuman strength and senses, and natural weaponry including claws and horns. Her rational mind has also retreated behind a bestial personality.Psi-Force #26 *Dehman Doosha (the Demon Within): A young, highly autistic pyrokinetic. He eventually joined the team Psi-Force. =Other notable nonparanormals= *Colby Shaw - ran the San Francisco branch of Sanctuary, the halfway house for runaways that the group called home for most of the first 16 issues. *The Skipper - CIA Agent and friend of Emmett Proudhawk. *Derek Shiningstar - CIA Agent and former friend of Emmett Proudhawk.

Chaser wrote a book Power for the Preying about Psi-Force after their supposed deaths based on his own investigations and friendship with Tyrone Jessup. Unfortunately, the book made life very difficult for Jessup's family, who were forced to relocate because of anti-paranormal prejudice.

Dr. Emmett Proudhawk is a CIA consultant and Native American Wicasa Wakan, which loosely translated means \\"Medicine Man\\" but is more accurately translated as Doctor of Mystery (where mystery here refers to the mystery and power of the spirit, of magic, of visions, and of divinity). Proudhawk undertook a vision quest in order to understand what the White Event is and why it occurred, and was surprised to find himself in the superflow, and even further surprised when his spirit guide, a hawk, spoke clearly when answering his questions (usually any answers given in a vision quest are metaphorical). When Proudhawk asked what the White Event was, his spirit guide answered that \\"It is the invitation to live with God and walk in the world with his powers\\". The superflow was further explained to Proudhawk as the \\"wakan condition\\", and is the source of all wakan (mystery), dreams, and visions come from. While Proudhawk had been able to partially see the superflow while on a normal vision quest (it was never fully visible to him), he had now been \\"touched\\" by it, directly implying that he, like four others, had gained superhuman powers. While it may be unclear if Proudhawk has any powers, his spirit guide told him that four others had been touched by wakan before him, and that the many others to follow after him would all need a \\"doctor who understands mystery\\". Proudawk sees the earth as water, but with a small island upon which he began his vision quest, complete with campfire. It is unclear if the hawk represents the alien device, another superhuman, or if the hawk is a function of any paranormal powers he may have, since it has yet to be concretely revealed if Proudhawk is a superhuman.

He was listed as 6' 4\\" (1.93 m) and 215 lbs, and was born in Detroit, Michigan. College career Lenard played college basketball at the University of Minnesota. After his junior season, he decided to test the waters of the NBA, and declared himself eligible for the draft. The Milwaukee Bucks selected Lenard in the second round of the 1994 NBA Draft. Lenard subsequently opted instead to return to Minnesota to play out his senior season. He finished his career with the Golden Gophers as the school's all- time leading scorer with 2,103 points. Professional career After graduating, Lenard went on to play in the minor-league Continental Basketball Association (CBA). He averaged 30.1 points per game in 18 games for the Oklahoma City Cavalry during the 1995‚Äì96 season.1996-97 Official CBA Guide and Register, page 286 He left in mid-season when he signed a contract with the Miami Heat of the NBA. =Miami Heat (1995‚Äì2000)= Lenard played in 30 games for Miami to finish the 1996 season, averaging 5.9 points a game off the bench. The franchise had recently been rebuilt led by head coach Pat Riley and featured all-stars Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway and another shooting guard who would split minutes with Lenard, Dan Majerle. Lenard increased his scoring to 12.3 points a game in the 1996‚Äì1997 season, as he started in 47 of 73 games for a Heat team that posted its then best season in franchise history with 61 regular-season wins, and a playoff run that included a first ever trip to the Eastern Conference Finals. Lenard was particularly effective at shooting from beyond the three-point line, placing 7th in the league in three-point shots made and 10th in the league in three-point shooting percentage. The season also featured a memorable moment for Lenard and the Heat, when on December 11 in a road game against the Cleveland Cavaliers he scrambled for a loose ball rebound with 3 seconds left and the game tied, managing to launch and make a double-pump leaning shot to give Miami the big road win and one of the most memorable game winners in Miami Heat history. In the playoffs Lenard started in all 17 games for the Heat, averaging 11.4 points a game including a 24-point playoff debut against the Orlando Magic in the first round and 19 points in the series clinching 5th game. Miami would face the New York Knicks in the semifinals, a series that would go to 7 games in which Lenard scored 22 points in game 3 and 21 in game 5. Miami would go on to lose in 5 games to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the East Finals. The now proven and popular Lenard would then start in 81 games in the 1997‚Äì1998 season, averaging 12.6 points a game while continuing to shoot 40 percent from three-point range. The Heat would make the playoffs but would lose in the first round to New York in 5 games in the first round, with Lenard averaging 14.4 points during the series. An injury would force Lenard to play in just 12 games in the lockout shortened 1998‚Äì1999 season, in which Miami again fell to the Knicks in the first round. In the 1999‚Äì2000 season Lenard played mostly off the bench, but averaged double-figure scoring with 11.9 points a game while shooting 39 percent from three-point range. Injuries would keep him out of the tail end of the season as well as the playoffs in which the Heat defeated the Detroit Pistons before once again falling to New York in a seven-game series. Following the season the Heat traded Lenard and Mark Strickland to the Denver Nuggets for Chris Gatling. =Denver Nuggets (2000‚Äì2002)= In his first season with the Nuggets, Lenard started in 58 of 80 regular-season games and averaged 12.2 points for a team that failed to make the playoffs, but he placed 10th in the league in total three-point field goals made. The following year featured lineup and rotation changes and he started in 19 of the 71 games he appeared in, but still averaged over 11 points a game. Following the season he signed with the Toronto Raptors. =Toronto Raptors (2002-2003)= The Raptors had made the playoffs for three straight seasons and featured superstar Vince Carter, all-star Antonio Davis and coach Lenny Wilkens. Lenard started in 24 games of the 63 in which he appeared, but averaged 30 minutes a game, his most on the floor since the 1998 season. As a result, he averaged a career-high 14.3 points a game and was second on the team in three-point field goals. Despite this, Carter's injuries and other problems with the team led them to miss the playoffs, and Lenard returned to Denver in the off-season. =Return to Denver and the playoffs (2003‚Äì2006)= The Nuggets had continued their playoff drought, but had managed to secure the 3rd pick in the 2003 NBA Draft and selected college star and NCAA Champion Carmelo Anthony. The 2003‚Äì2004 season would then prove to be a personal best for Lenard, as he started in 70 games and averaged 14.2 points a game as the Nuggets, led by the play of Anthony, Andre Miller and Marcus Camby, returned to the postseason. Lenard was also the winner of the 2004 NBA All-Star Weekend Three-point Shootout which took place in Los Angeles, and would see his first postseason action since 1999, averaging a personal best 17 points a game in a five-game series loss against the top-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves. The Nuggets looked forward to the 2004‚Äì2005 season with optimism following the off-season acquisition of all-star forward Kenyon Martin, but in the season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers Lenard suffered an Achilles tendon injury that forced him out of nearly the entire season, only managing to play in two other games. Despite his limited mobility Lenard was able to participate in the 2005 three-point shootout during All-Star weekend, which was won by Quentin Richardson. Despite returning to action in the 2005‚Äì2006 season, Lenard suffered more injuries and was packaged to the Portland Trail Blazers in a four-team trade at the time of season trade deadline in February. =Portland Trail Blazers (2006)= Lenard would only play in 14 games to finish the season in Portland, and retired at the conclusion of 2006 season.

Allegedly written in honour of and taking its title from the nickname of the proprietor of a nightclub, who was known as \\"El Choclo\\". It is one of the most popular tangos in Argentina. History The piece was premiered in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1903 ‚Äì the date appears on a program of the venue ‚Äì at the elegant restaurant El Americano on Cangallo 966 (today Teniente General Per√≥n 966) by the orchestra led by Jos√© Luis Roncallo. \\"El Choclo\\" has been recorded (without vocals) by many dance orchestras, especially in Argentina. A number of vocal versions were recorded in the United States in 1952, but the most popular was the one by Georgia Gibbs, which reached #1 on the Billboard chart under the name \\"Kiss of Fire\\".Billboard June 14, 1952 See page 50 The Nation's Top Tunes Billboard April 5, 1952. https://books.google.com/books?id=hB4EAAAAMBAJ&q;=kiss+of+fire see page 52 Tony Martin's version reached #6, Toni Arden's #14, Billy Eckstine's #16, Louis Armstrong's #20, and Guy Lombardo's version reached #30. There are Spanish versions of \\"Kiss of Fire\\" by Connie Francis and Nat King Cole. In 1953 Olavi Virta and Metro-Tyt√∂t released a Finnish version, titled \\"Tulisuudelma\\", which means \\"Kiss of Fire\\". The Finnish words, by \\"Kullervo\\" (Tapio Kullervo Lahtinen), closely follow the English. In 2001 the hip-hop group Delinquent Habits made the song known to a new generation when they released \\"Return of the tres\\", which relies heavily on samplings from a Mariachi version of the classical tango.  Lyrics  The original lyrics by Villoldo specifically sang about the corn cob as food. He later wrote another version titled \\"Cari√±o Puro\\" (meaning Pure Tenderness). Another version was written by Marambio Cat√°n, but the most popular remains Enrique Santos Disc√©polo's (1947), which sing about tango as a way of life. Louis Armstrong sang English lyrics using the title El Choclo (Kiss of Fire). This English word variant was translated back into Spanish as Beso de Fuego and as such the song was sung by Connie Francis.

In ski jumping he competed from 1992 to 2004, with his career best achievement being the winner of the 2002 Four Hills Tournament and becoming the first athlete in history to win all four events in the same tournament. He also finished runner-up twice in the World Cup season, winning four medals at the Ski Jumping World Championships, as well as three medals each at the Winter Olympics and Ski Flying World Championships. After retiring from ski jumping, Hannawald played football for Kreisliga club TSV Burgau, and drove for Callaway Competition in the ADAC GT Masters series.ADAC GT Masters - Driver biography - Sven Hannawald Early life Hannawald was born in Erlabrunn and grew up in the nearby town of Johanngeorgenstadt by SC Dynamo Johanngeorgenstadt in the Ore Mountains. At age twelve, he was sent to a special school for young athletes in Klingenthal (SG Dynamo Klingenthal), also in Saxony. In 1991 his family moved to Jettingen-Scheppach near Ulm where he transferred to the Furtwangen Ski Boarding School, where he completed an apprenticeship in Communication Electronics. Ski jumping career In 1998, Hannawald won a silver medal at the 1998 Ski Flying World Championships in Oberstdorf as well as a silver medal at the Olympic Games in Nagano in the team large hill event. In the 1998/99 season, he finished fifth place overall in World Cup Ski Jumping. At the world championships in Ramsau, he won a silver medal in the individual large hill behind Martin Schmitt, as well as winning a gold medal in the team large hill event. In 2000 Hannawald won the Ski-flying World Championships in Vikersund. He also won the ski jumping competition at the Holmenkollen ski festival that year. In the 2000/01 season, Hannawald won gold in the team large hill event and bronze in the team normal hill event at the world championships in Lahti. The following winter of 2001/02 was the most successful of his career: Sven Hannawald ended second in the World Cup, winning all four Individual jumping titles at the Four Hills Tournament, the first to do so. He successfully defended his title of Ski Flying World Champion. At the Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, he won gold in the team large hill and silver in the individual normal hill,Holmenkollen winners since 1892 - click Vinnere for downloadable pdf file and was even nominated for Sportsman of the Year in Germany. Despite all of his successes, however, Hannawald couldn't top Adam Malysz in the overall World Cup ranking. In the 2002/03 season he finished again second in the world rankings and managed to set another highlight of his career: at the Worldcup competition in Willingen, Germany , he became the third person in history to achieve perfect marks from all five judges (20 points maximum) - 27 years after the first one (Anton Innauer) and five years after the second one (Kazuyoshi Funaki). This mark has been matched only about one hour later at the same World Cup competition by Hideharu Miyahira, who finished sixth. Then it took another six years until Wolfgang Loitzl at Bischofshofen, Austria in 2009 during the 2008/09 Four Hills Tournament became the fifth one. In the 2003/04 season, he performed well below personal expectations. His best result was fourth in Trondheim. As a consequence of that, Hannawald ended his season prematurely. On 29 April 2004, Hannawald revealed that he was suffering from burnout, and had put himself into psychiatric treatment. During this time, Sven Hannawald managed to recover and reappeared to the public.Sven Hannawald: Der Ex-Skisprungstar wird Motorsportler On 3 August 2005, he ended his career as a ski jumper, explaining through his managers that, after successfully dealing with his burnout, he no longer wished to suffer the stresses of professional sport.Ex-Skispringer: Die gro√üe Leere im Leben des Sven Hannawald.

Deslauriers was selected by the Oilers in the second round of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft with the 31st overall pick.  Playing career  Deslauriers was selected from Chicoutimi of the QMJHL, where he was the starting goaltender for three seasons. The 2004-05 season was Deslauriers' first professional experience. He split time between the Edmonton Road Runners of the AHL and the Greenville Grrrowl of the ECHL. It was not a good season for Deslauriers, as he fought injury problems, and played for an AHL team that failed to make the playoffs. In the 2005-06 season, due to the Oilers not having a farm team, Deslauriers only played 13 games and struggled, before being sent down once again to the Grrrowl. The 2006-07 season was a turnaround, however. Deslauriers was back in the AHL with the Wilkes- Barre/Scranton Penguins, and eventually became the team's starting goaltender. He played well, and ranked among the top goaltenders in the league. Deslauriers in an Edmonton Oilers uniform in 2009 On October 17, 2008, Deslauriers earned his first NHL win in a 4-3 victory over the Calgary Flames. Over the course of his first four appearances, he put up sparkling numbers, including a 3-0 record with a 1.50 goals allowed average and a .951 save percentage. However, after two games where he allowed four goals or more, and as a result of the three-headed goaltending carousel of Dwayne Roloson and Mathieu Garon, he was relegated to the bench and occasional rehab stints in the AHL. With the trade of Garon to the Pittsburgh Penguins, however, he regained his full-time backup position as Edmonton's number two goalie. Following the 2008-09 NHL Season, Roloson left the Oilers via free-agency, and the Oilers replaced him with veteran goalie Nikolai Khabibulin. Deslauriers was to be his back-up, and he started off the season with limited playing time. He played just three times in Edmonton's first 21 games, but posted respectable stats, going 1-1-1 with a 1.96 goals allowed average and a .937 save percentage. Shortly after his 3rd start, Khabibulin was injured and Deslauriers went on to start 14 straight games in his absence, but with less impressive statistics. In January 2010, the Oilers announced that Khabibulin would undergo season ending surgery, thrusting Deslauriers into the starting role. After an unspectacular year as the Oilers number one goalie, Deslauriers had to battle in training camp for the back-up role against Devan Dubnyk and former NHLer Martin Gerber. At first the Oilers decided to keep both Dubnyk and Deslauriers, though Deslauriers did not receive any playing time. On November 1, 2010, Deslauriers was placed on waivers leaving Devan Dubnyk as the primary backup for the Oilers. Deslauriers was assigned to the Oklahoma City Barons where he was the number two goalie behind Gerber. Deslauriers played for Team Canada at the 2010 Spengler Cup where he was named top goaltender. On July 12, 2011, Deslauriers signed a two-year contract with the Anaheim Ducks. On January 10, 2012, he earned his first win as a Duck, a 5-2 win over the Dallas Stars. After playing the entirety of the 2013‚Äì14 season in the AHL with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, Deslauriers as a free agent agreed to attend the Los Angeles Kings 2014 training camp on a try-out contract on September 2, 2014. He was released from his tryout by the Kings on September 26, 2014. After one season in the Kontinental Hockey League with Latvian club Dinamo Riga, Deslauriers continued his career abroad by signing a one-year contract with German club Augsburger Panther of the DEL on June 19, 2015. Upon his retirement, Deslauriers resided in Edmonton and worked in commercial real estate.

Its name is a parody of the \\"Plastic Ono Band\\". Produced by Masatoshi Hashiba on Toshiba-EMI Records (now EMI Music Japan), the band was led by the then husband and wife team of guitarist Kazuhiko Kato, and his wife, singer Mika Fukui . The word \\"sadistic\\" is reported to be inspired by her insensitive sense of humour. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked the band at No. 94 on their list of the \\"Top 100 Japanese Pops Artists\\". In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated their 1974 album Kurofune at No. 9 on its list of the \\"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time\\".  History  Kazuhiko Kato moved to Kensington, London in 1972 and, impressed by the burgeoning glam rock scene led by T. Rex and David Bowie, he set about forming a new group in Japan to emulate the style. The original lineup of the band included Kato, Mika, drummer Hiro Tsunoda and lead guitarist Masayoshi Takanaka. This lineup recorded the single \\"Cycling Boogie\\" in 1973, released on Donuts Records, Japan's first private label that was founded by Kato. Subsequently Tsunoda left the band, to be replaced by Yukihiro Takahashi, and bassist Ray Ohara joined the band. This lineup completed the band's self-titled debut album, which was released on the Harvest label in the United Kingdom. Kato passed the album to Malcolm McLaren who at the time had a shop with Vivienne Westwood, and McLaren passed it on to Bryan Ferry, whose band Roxy Music it would later support on a tour. Their second album was recorded in England, produced by Chris Thomas. Thomas also introduced Mika to Badfinger while he produced their 1974 LP Wish You Were Here. Her vocals can be heard on the track \\"Know One Knows\\" (translating Pete Ham's lyrics to Japanese). Keyboardist Yu Imai, who had worked as a supporting musician on the first album was promoted to full member status. The album sold well in Japan. In the UK; however, the album sold poorly but received high praise from critics. Ohara left the band, and was replaced by Tsugutoshi Got≈ç. Chris Thomas also produced their third album Hot! Menu. The album, which featured tracks such as \\"Mada Mada Samba\\", is now quite rare although it was featured on BBC Radio 3's Sounds Interesting. The band played live on BBC TV's Old Grey Whistle Test in October 1975. The band performed two tracks: \\"Time to Noodle\\" and \\"Suki Suki Suki\\". When they appeared, a stagehand arranged for the name of the programme (usually shown hung from the back wall) to be spelt as The Old Gley Whistle Test as a joke on the Japanese mispronunciation of the letters L and R. The band also made an appearance on BBC TV's Pebble Mill at One and were interviewed by Jan Leeming. Photographs from this appearance were published in the book S/M/B/2 (2006, Shinko Music) by Masayoshi Sukita, who was a close friend of the band. The band played live in the United Kingdom supporting Roxy Music including a show at Wembley Stadium. It was the first ever UK tour by a Japanese rock band. Recordings from these concerts were released as their Live in London album. After this album was released, Kazuhiko Kato and Mika divorced, and both left the band. Mika later married Chris Thomas and moved to the UK, where she worked as a food researcher.  The Sadistics  The remaining members ‚Äì Takahashi, Takanaka, Imai, and Got≈ç ‚Äì continued for several years as The Sadistics. They released two studio albums and two live albums before the band eventually petered out in 1979 as the members became busy with their solo careers and other projects, such as the Yellow Magic Orchestra and Imitation. All members continued to work with Kazuhiko Kato on his solo albums in the 1970s and '80s.  Post-disbandment  Kazuhiko Kato became a radio show presenter and a television personality in Japan. He had a successful solo career after the Sadistic Mika Band broke up; pursuing a ska direction before acquiring interest in European experimental music. Most of his solo work employed the talents of the other former Sadistic Mika Band members and other notable guest artists such as Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono and Akiko Yano. He released two acoustic albums with K≈çnosuke Sakazaki of The Alfee under the name Kazukoh in 2007 (Golden Hits) and 2009 (Happy End), and found time to form a new band called Vitamin-Q in 2008, releasing one album (VITAMIN-Q feat ANZA). Kato committed suicide by hanging on October 17, 2009 in the Kitasaku District of Karuizawa in Nagano Prefecture, Japan.Kyodo News - Musician Kazuhiko Kato found hanged at Karuizawa hotel Band producer Masatoshi Hashiba also produced the popular band Vodka Collins. Drummer Yukihiro Takahashi went on to become part of the influential synthpop trio Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), in which he provided the majority of lead vocals. In the early 2000s, he formed the duo Sketch Show with his ex-YMO bandmate Haruomi Hosono; with Ryuichi Sakamoto becoming regularly involved, the YMO name was later resurrected. In 2014, Takahashi formed the supergroup Metafive, which continues to the present. He has also acted in a number of films and TV shows, usually in comedic roles. Ray Ohara was a regular member of Takahashi's band in the 1980s and 1990s. Mika released a self-produced album in 1994, where she wrote all songs and lyrics. Tsugutoshi Got≈ç has released a large number of albums both solo, and as a member of various bands. Yu Imai went on to form the group Imitation and collaborated with members of Sandii & the Sunsetz and Talking Heads. He was also the chief musical collaborator with lyricist Chris Mosdell on three of his solo albums, Equasian (also with Kazuhiko Kato), The Oracles of Distraction, and Fingerprints of the Gods ‚Äì the latter being the sonic setting of the Graham Hancock book of the same title. Masayoshi Takanaka went on to become one of the most famous guitarists in Japan. He has been releasing studio albums and touring to this day.  Reunions  The band has reunited three times. Each time Kazuhiko Kato, Yukihiro Takahashi and Masayoshi Takanaka have formed the core of the band, with a different female lead vocalist and supporting musicians. In 1985, the band reunited as the Sadistic Yuming Band. Tsugutoshi Got≈ç returned on bass. In addition, Ryuichi Sakamoto played keyboards and Yumi Matsutoya, AKA Yuming, sang the female lead vocals. In 1989, the band reunited as the Sadistic Mica Band with Ray Ohara on bass instead of Got≈ç, and Karen Kirishima on vocals. Appare, an album featuring new material, was released, as well as the accompanying live album Seiten. In 2006, the band reunited and became the Sadistic Mikaela Band, with 22-year-old pop singer Kaela Kimura on lead vocals. The lineup released the album Narkissos, featuring a track by renowned English lyricist Chris Mosdell, which sold 92,568 copies and ranked number 147 in the yearly best selling chart. The group also completed a national tour culminating in a show at NHK Hall in Shibuya, Tokyo. In 2007, the band released a 3-disc live retrospective including material from 1975 and 2006, plus video clips.

Technique and materials  When painting, Texeira begins with a penciled layout on loose paper, and following approval of the layout, will acquire reference photos or hire models to pose for him, in order to \\"capture the feeling of the sketch as closely as possible.\\" Texeira will then apply a few layers of gesso to a Masonite board, and then carefully lay the drawing out in tight pencil, noting subtleties of skin tone and sharpening the image throughout the process. He will then create the underpainting, in which he applies sepias, or a mix of browns, blacks and whites.

Members of both traditions worship together and play a part in the life of both the Church of England and the Methodist Church throughout West Bromwich. The church is situated at the junction of Dudley Street and Carter's Green. The postcode is B70 9LR.  History  In 1869 a day school was opened in Old Meeting Street, West Bromwich, and the buildings were soon used for Sunday worship. The Parish of St. Andrew, West Bromwich was created in 1879 as part of Lichfield Diocese, with worship continuing on the premises in Old Meeting Street until the 1920s. In 1915, work started on a new church building at Carter's Green. The First World War prevented much work being done and the official foundation stone was not laid until 1922. The first part of the building was completed in 1924 and consecrated for worship the following year. Just before the Second World War, two bays and a baptistry were completed and consecrated on 21 January 1940. In 1982, work was completed to create a social area, kitchen and other facilities, and in 1998 a coffee lounge was created alongside the kitchen. Among recent developments has been the addition, in 2015, of 74 photovoltaic panels (solar panels) on the roof, undertaken in partnership with Power for Good Co-operative Ltd.  The Parish  The title of the parish is formally \\"The Parish of St. Andrew's-with-Christ Church, West Bromwich\\". Christ Church was an imposing building on High Street, now demolished. In 1988 the parish of Christ Church was divided between the Anglican parishes of The Good Shepherd with St. John, St. Philip's and St. Andrew's. The site where Christ Church stood is within St. Andrew's parish boundary and hence this parish's expanded full name.  The Ecumenical Partnership  Swan Village Methodist Church and St. Andrew's had shared in joint services for many years. When the Methodist church building became difficult to maintain, the congregation decided to join together with the Anglican congregation in the St. Andrew's building. The arrangement was further established in 1988 with a formal Sharing Agreement. Funds from both churches were used to build the extension, including an upstairs room for meetings - the Cygnet Room. In 2002, the joint congregation signed a Declaration of Intent for Ecumenical Partnership, and there is now fully a Partnership Congregation. St. Andrew's is also host to Forward in Faith Ministries, a church of Zimbabwean origin and tradition (with no connection with the Anglican organisation of the same name).  Staff  The ordained staff at St. Andrew's are currently the Revd. Nigel Ely (Vicar) and the Revd. Phil Thomas (Methodist Minister).

The company was based at 280 Brooklands Road, Manchester, M23 9HD.

Deflektor was also ported to the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. After the production of Hostile All Terrain Encounter in 1988, Costa spent the next two years deciding where he wanted to go. In 1990 Vortex was reborn with Costa, Mark and Luke and the intention to develop a game for the Amiga and Atari ST.

Schafer Field in Beal City, Michigan. The game is not sanctioned by the NCAA. It annually invites the #1 and #2 teams in the nation to play in a college football championship game. Although the group formally invites college teams every year to play in the bowl, no school has ever accepted an invitation. However, some athletic directors and conference presidents/commissioners have sent response letters, declining while sarcastically telling the group that it was an honor to be invited. Responses have been received from Jim Delany, Jack Swarbrick, and Pat Richter, among others. The Tom Bowl started in 1989 by a group of fans with invitations extended to the University of Colorado and the University of Miami. Colorado declined the invitation and alternate teams of Middle Tennessee State and Eastern Michigan were invited. From 1990 to 2006, the Tom Bowl annually invited the top two teams unless those teams played each other in another bowl game. In those years the Tom Bowl has elected to have alternative games such as a battle between the #3 and #4 teams to determine the \\"true #2\\" or as in 2002, the Big Ten Championship when Iowa and Ohio State didn't play during the regular season. Following the 2005 season, the Tom Bowl broke with tradition and used a BCS-like formula to invite three teams: USC, Texas, and Penn State to play in Tom Bowl XVII. Predictably, none of the teams showed up (though the Pac-10 replied, apparently accepting the invitation but pledging not to show up on behalf of USC) and only twelve spectators did. The game was declared a 0-0-0 tie. In 2007, the Tom Bowl devised a new format where the top three teams were invited to play in a round-robin tournament style game with each team playing each other for a half. The Tom Bowl has used this formula ever since, although in 2009 invites were extended to six different teams including Emory University, which boasts of being undefeated since 1836 because they do not have a football team. The Tom Bowl returned to the three team format in 2010.

In an hour-long procedure a veterinary surgeon implanted a microphone in the cat's ear canal, a small radio transmitter at the base of its skull and a thin wire into its fur. This would allow the cat to innocuously record and transmit sound from its surroundings. Due to problems with distraction, the cat's sense of hunger had to be addressed in another operation. Victor Marchetti, a former CIA officer, said Project Acoustic Kitty cost about $20 million. The first Acoustic Kitty mission was to eavesdrop on two men in a park outside the Soviet compound on Wisconsin Avenue in Washington, D.C.

In voltammetry, information about an analyte is obtained by measuring the current as the potential is varied. The analytical data for a voltammetric experiment comes in the form of a voltammagram which plots the current produced by the analyte versus the potential of the working electrode.  Three electrode system  Potential as a function of time for anodic stripping voltammetry Three- electrode setup: (1) working electrode; (2) counter electrode; (3) reference electrode Voltammetry experiments investigate the half-cell reactivity of an analyte. Voltammetry is the study of current as a function of applied potential. These curves I = f(E) are called voltammograms. The potential is varied arbitrarily either step by step or continuously, and the actual current value is measured as the dependent variable. The opposite, i.e., amperometry, is also possible but not common. The shape of the curves depends on the speed of potential variation (nature of driving force) and on whether the solution is stirred or quiescent (mass transfer). Most experiments control the potential (volts) of an electrode in contact with the analyte while measuring the resulting current (amperes). To conduct such an experiment one requires at least two electrodes. The working electrode, which makes contact with the analyte, must apply the desired potential in a controlled way and facilitate the transfer of charge to and from the analyte. A second electrode acts as the other half of the cell. This second electrode must have a known potential with which to gauge the potential of the working electrode, furthermore it must balance the charge added or removed by the working electrode. While this is a viable setup, it has a number of shortcomings. Most significantly, it is extremely difficult for an electrode to maintain a constant potential while passing current to counter redox events at the working electrode. To solve this problem, the roles of supplying electrons and providing a reference potential are divided between two separate electrodes. The reference electrode is a half cell with a known reduction potential. Its only role is to act as reference in measuring and controlling the working electrode's potential and at no point does it pass any current. The auxiliary electrode passes all the current needed to balance the current observed at the working electrode. To achieve this current, the auxiliary will often swing to extreme potentials at the edges of the solvent window, where it oxidizes or reduces the solvent or supporting electrolyte. These electrodes, the working, reference, and auxiliary make up the modern three electrode system. There are many systems which have more electrodes, but their design principles are generally the same as the three electrode system. For example, the rotating ring-disk electrode has two distinct and separate working electrodes, a disk and a ring, which can be used to scan or hold potentials independently of each other. Both of these electrodes are balanced by a single reference and auxiliary combination for an overall four electrode design. More complicated experiments may add working electrodes as required and at times reference or auxiliary electrodes. In practice it can be important to have a working electrode with known dimensions and surface characteristics. As a result, it is common to clean and polish working electrodes regularly. The auxiliary electrode can be almost anything as long as it doesn't react with the bulk of the analyte solution and conducts well. It is (or was?) common to use mercury as working electrode e.g. DME and HMDE, and also as auxiliary, and the voltammetry method is then known as polarography. The reference is the most complex of the three electrodes; there are a variety of standards used and it is worth investigating elsewhere. For non-aqueous work, IUPAC recommends the use of the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple as an internal standard. In most voltammetry experiments, a bulk electrolyte (also known as a supporting electrolyte) is used to minimize solution resistance. It is possible to run an experiment without a bulk electrolyte, but the added resistance greatly reduces the accuracy of the results. With room temperature ionic liquids, the solvent can act as the electrolyte.  Theory  Data analysis requires the consideration of kinetics in addition to thermodynamics, due to the temporal component of voltammetry. Idealized theoretical electrochemical thermodynamic relationships such as the Nernst equation are modeled without a time component. While these models are insufficient alone to describe the dynamic aspects of voltammetry, models like the Tafel equation and Butler‚ÄìVolmer equation lay the groundwork for the modified voltammetry relationships that relate theory to observed results.  Types of voltammetry  * Linear sweep voltammetry * Staircase voltammetry * Squarewave voltammetry * Cyclic voltammetry - A voltammetric method that can be used to determine diffusion coefficients and half cell reduction potentials. * Anodic stripping voltammetry - A quantitative, analytical method for trace analysis of metal cations. The analyte is deposited (electroplated) onto the working electrode during a deposition step, and then oxidized during the stripping step. The current is measured during the stripping step. * Cathodic stripping voltammetry - A quantitative, analytical method for trace analysis of anions. A positive potential is applied, oxidizing the mercury electrode and forming insoluble precipitates of the anions. A negative potential then reduces (strips) the deposited film into solution. * Adsorptive stripping voltammetry - A quantitative, analytical method for trace analysis. The analyte is deposited simply by adsorption on the electrode surface (i.e., no electrolysis), then electrolyzed to give the analytical signal. Chemically modified electrodes are often used. * Alternating current voltammetry * Polarography - a subclass of voltammetry where the working electrode is a dropping mercury electrode (DME), useful for its wide cathodic range and renewable surface. * Rotated electrode voltammetry - A hydrodynamic technique in which the working electrode, usually a rotating disk electrode (RDE) or rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE), is rotated at a very high rate. This technique is useful for studying the kinetics and electrochemical reaction mechanism for a half reaction. * Normal pulse voltammetry * Differential pulse voltammetry * Chronoamperometry  History  The beginning of voltammetry was facilitated by the discovery of polarography in 1922 by the Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning chemist Jaroslav Heyrovsk√Ω. Early voltammetric techniques had many problems, limiting their viability for everyday use in analytical chemistry. In polarography, these problems included the fact that mercury is oxidized at a potential that is more positive than +0.2, which makes it harder to analyze the results for the analytes in the positive region of the potential. Another problem included the residual current obtained from the charging of the large capacitance of the electrode surface.Kounaves, Samuel. \\"Voltammetric Techniques\\". Tufts University Department of Chemistry When Heyrovsky first recorded the first dependence on the current flowing through the dropping mercury electrode on the applied potential in 1922, he took point-by-point measurements and he plotted a current-voltage curve. This was considered to be the first polarogram. In order to facilitate this process, he constructed what is now known as a polarograph with M. Shikata and, with enabled him to record photographically the same curve in a matter of hours. He gave recognition to the importance of potential and its control and also recognized the opportunities of measuring the limiting currents. He was also an important part of the introduction of dropping mercury electrode as a modern-day tool. In 1942 Archie Hickling built the first three electrodes potentiostat, which was an advancement for the field of electrochemistry. He used this potentiostat to control the voltage of an electrode. In the meantime, the late 1940s, Kenneth Cole invented an electronic circuit which he called a voltage clamp. The voltage clamp was used to analyze the ionic conduction in nerves. The 1960s and 1970s saw many advances in the theory, instrumentation, and the introduction of computer added and controlled systems. Modern polarographic and voltammetric methods on mercury electrodes came about in three sections. The first section includes the development of the mercury electrodes. The following electrodes were produced: dropping mercury electrode, mercury steaming electrode, hanging mercury drop electrode, static mercury drop electrode, mercury film electrode, mercury amalgam electrodes, mercury microelectrodes, chemically modified mercury electrodes, controlled growth mercury electrodes, and contractible mercury drop electrodes. There was also an advancement of the measuring techniques used. These measuring techniques include : classical DC polarography, oscillopolarography, Kaloussek's switcher, AC polarography, tast polarography, normal pulse polarography, differential pulse polarography, square-wave voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, anodic stripping voltammetry, convolution techniques, and elimination methods. Lastly, there was also an advancement of preconcentration techniques that produced an increased the sensitivity of the mercury electrodes. This came about through the development of anodic stripping voltammetry, cathodic stripping voltammetry and adsorptive stripping voltammetry. These advancements improved sensitivity and created new analytical methods, which prompted the industry to respond with the production of cheaper potentiostat, electrodes, and cells that could be effectively used in routine analytical work.  Applications  =Voltammetric sensors= A number of voltammetric systems are produced commercially for the determination of specific species that are of interest in industry and research. These devices are sometimes called electrodes but are, in fact, complete voltammetric cells and are better referred to as sensors. These sensors can be employed for the analysis of various organic and inorganic analytes in various matrices. =The oxygen electrode= The determination of dissolved oxygen in a variety of aqueous environments, such as sea water, blood, sewage, effluents from chemical plants, and soils is of tremendous importance to industry, biomedical and environmental research, and clinical medicine. One of the most common and convenient methods for making such measurements is with the Clark oxygen sensor, which was patented by L.C. Clark, Jr. in 1956.

Maier Festival Grounds during the 1994 Summerfest, with Downtown Milwaukee and Interstate 794 in the background. Henry Maier Festival Park (also known as the Henry Maier Festival Grounds or the Summerfest Grounds) is a festival park located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Park is named for Henry Maier, Milwaukee's longest-serving mayor. Before Summerfest In 1927 Maitland Airport was opened. It was one of the city's first airstrips. The airport remained in operation for more than 20 years before it was replaced by a Nike missile installation, established during the height of '50s Cold War tensions. The site was one of eight in the Greater Milwaukee area and hosted both the Nike Ajax and nuclear-capable Nike Hercules missiles as a means of last resort against a possible attack by the Soviet Union. The military installation, along with a radar station at Lake Park, remained in use until 1969 when the Army closed them in an effort to reduce costs. The land was then sold to the city and became a top possible destination by Summerfest's early leaders, who worried for the fest's future after bad weather caused a poor turnout in its second year. Organizers believed that a centralized location was crucial, and the lakefront site appeared ideal. In 1970, the Harbor Commission, which took ownership of the land from the Army, constructed a deal and began leasing the site to Summerfest for one dollar a year. The recently formed Summerfest quickly set up makeshift offices from the remaining barracks and the control building. Summerfest The history of the Henry Maier Festival Park starts with Summerfest in 1968. The music festival was created that year, and found some success, being held in 35 different locations. The next year, however, was inundated with horrific weather, forcing cancellation of the last day and ensuring financial losses for that year. In 1970 a central location was decided upon: an abandoned strip of land along the lakefront in the downtown area, which was the former Maitland Airport and served as a Nike missile site during the Cold War. The early Summerfest Grounds consisted of little more than concrete blocks with wooden slabs placed on top to serve as stages, in the middle of a grassy, muddy field. Despite this, the central location was key to the festival's success, ensuring the existence and expansion of the grounds. Construction continued through the 1970s and 1980s, with the highlight of the creation of the Marcus Amphitheater, a 23,000 seat partially covered venue, in 1987. Other festivals The Mid Gate of the Henry Maier Festival Park, during Milwaukee Irish Fest 2005. Various ethnic and cultural festivals came to be held at the festival park beginning in the 1980s, as well as several run/walks for charity events. *African World Festival *Arab World Fest *Asian Moon Festival *Festa Italiana *German Fest *Indian Summer Festival *Irish Fest *Labor Fest *Mexican Fiesta *Polish Fest *PrideFest See also * Parks of Milwaukee * Lakeshore State Park, located directly across a lagoon to the east References External links *Henry Maier Festival Park Calendar of Events *History of Summerfest (including the grounds) *Maitland Airport & Military Reservation details and images Category:Economy of Milwaukee Category:Culture of Milwaukee Category:Landmarks in Wisconsin Category:Tourism in Wisconsin Category:Tourist attractions in Milwaukee Category:Festival venues in the United States ","title":"Henry Maier Festival Park"},{"id":"2430203","text":"The Rakes were an English indie rock band formed in London in 2003.

Their debut album, Capture/Release, spawned the singles \\"22 Grand Job\\", \\"Work, Work, Work (Pub, Club, Sleep)\\", and \\"Retreat\\". Several of their singles appeared in the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart and Capture/Release reached No. 32 in the UK Albums Chart.Everyhit.com - accessed April 2009 The final single release from Capture/Release, \\"All Too Human\\", was released in the UK on 27 February 2006 and reached their best chart position (No. 22). The Rakes' second album, Ten New Messages, was released by V2 Records on 19 March 2007. This album was produced by Jim Abiss (who has also worked with Arctic Monkeys, Editors and Kasabian) and Brendan Lynch (who has worked with Primal Scream). It was recorded in Mayfair Studios in London during the autumn of 2006. The band's third album, Klang, was recorded at Karl-Marx-Allee in Berlin in a studio that was the former East German government's centre for radio broadcasts. The Rakes accompanied Franz Ferdinand on their You Could Have It So Much Better... tour during the winter of 2005. They toured the UK throughout January and February 2006, supported by White Rose Movement, Duels, Young Knives, Switches and Klaxons. They also completed their first tour of the UK since the release of Ten New Messages, including their biggest headline concert, a sold out show at Brixton Academy. On 22 October 2009, The Rakes announced that the band was to split with immediate effect: \\"The Rakes have always been very adamant and proud of the fact that we give 100% to every gig we've ever played. If we can't give it everything then we won't do it. That was the rule we set ourselves from day one\\". In 2015 lead singer Alan Donohoe told NME \\"Being in The Rakes was an insane rollercoaster, but singing the same songs for seven years got boring in the end. And if you're doing something just because you can't imagine an alternative then you're not really living.\\" Drummer Lasse Petersen has since joined Wolf Gang. Donohoe started a new solo project titled The Champagne Campaign and released the video for single Denis and Margaret in April 2013 before releasing the single for digital download on 13 May. However, the official website and Twitter account for The Champagne Campaign has since been taken down and the future of the project is uncertain. As of September 2015 Donohoe works for a Brighton-based company as a software developer.

The flag raisers were Harold Henry Schultz, Harold \\"Pie\\" Keller, Ira Hamilton Hayes, Michael Strank, Harlon Henry Block, and Franklin Runyon Sousley; the latter three men were killed later in the battle. Strank was a sergeant who refused a promotion to staff sergeant before the battle in order to \\"Bring his boys back to their mothers.\\" Block was a corporal who reported to Strank, as was Keller, and the rest were privates first class. John Bradley was a Navy corpsman who administered first aid to Easy Company, 28th Marines, 5th Marine Division, the company to which all the flag raisers were assigned, and was part of the first flag raising that took place before the famous photograph of the second flag raising. It was believed until 2016 that Pfc. Rene Gagnon was one of the flag raisers, instead of Keller, and Gagnon went on the bond drive that is featured in the book, even though he was not part of either flag raising. The book, published in May 2000 by Bantam Books, a division of Random House, spent 46 weeks on The New York Times nonfiction bestseller list, spending six weeks at number one. Shortly after the book's publication, Steven Spielberg acquired the option on the film rights for DreamWorks Pictures. The book follows the lives of the six flag raisers through their early lives of innocence, military training, fierce combat, and afterward, when they were sent on tours to raise money for war bonds. The film adaptation Flags of Our Fathers, which opened in the U.S. on October 20, 2006, was directed by Clint Eastwood and produced by Eastwood, Steven Spielberg, and Robert Lorenz, with a screenplay written by William Broyles, Jr. and Paul Haggis.

On this EP, the band has moved away from the sound they had developed on their previous album Hellfire Club. The songs on \\"Superheroes\\" are much less akin to the band's native style of power metal, but tends towards the direction of hard rock. In addition to the title track, which also appears on the band's 2006 album Rocket Ride, the EP includes 5 other tracks. The fourth track, an epic track titled \\"Judas at the Opera\\", is somewhat reminiscent to Tobias Sammet's project Avantasia. It also features vocals from Michael Kiske of Helloween and Avantasia fame. The fifth track is a cover of Magnum's song \\"The Spirit\\".

It is a coming of age film in which a group of high school and college age teenagers sign up for several months of training aboard a sail ship, a brigantine, and travel around half the globe when suddenly they are challenged by a severe storm. The film stars Jeff Bridges in the role of the captain, called \\"Skipper\\", his wife, played by Caroline Goodall, and a supporting cast portraying a group of nearly a dozen student sailors. The film was based on the 1962 book The Last Voyage of the Albatross by Charles Gieg Jr. and Felix Sutton. Plot The film is based on the fate of the brigantine Albatross, which sank 2 May 1961, allegedly because of a white squall. The film relates the ill-fated school sailing trip led by Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), whom the boys call \\"Skipper\\". He is tough and teaches them discipline. He forms a close connection with all-American Chuck Gieg (Scott Wolf), troubled rich kid Frank Beaumont (Jeremy Sisto), shy Gil Martin (Ryan Phillippe) and bad-boy Dean Preston (Eric Michael Cole). On the first days, it is discovered that one of the student crew members, Gil Martin, suffers from acrophobia and does not even try to rescue Chuck, who nearly chokes to death when he becomes entangled in some rigging after slipping from one of the masts. After Chuck is saved by Skipper Sheldon, Gil is ordered to climb the ropes, which he ultimately cannot do, and is assigned to alternative limited duty while on board. Frank‚Äôs snobby attitude causes him to bump heads with most of the boys, especially Dean, while Gil opens up to Chuck about his troubled home life one night in their bunks, which Frank listens to and identifies with it as well. After many misadventures on land and on the boat, the boys begin to take Skipper‚Äôs teachings seriously and begin acting like real shipmates, with Chuck, Frank, Gil and Dean becoming strong friends. Eventually, the brigantine puts into shore and the boys take their leave on the island. Frank's wealthy father and mother give him a surprise visit while the crew is in port. Frank is upset that the visit seems poorly timed by his overbearing parents, and he becomes separated from the boys and their festivities when his parents require him to go out to \\"steak dinner\\" with them. The father and son end up in a fist fight and become further estranged by the visit and the fight. Frank gets drunk and comes to the party and has to be escorted out by Chuck, Gil and Dean. After a night of festivities, the crew set out to sea again on the next day. When the brigantine encounters a school of dolphins, Frank, still angry at his father, vents his fury by shooting one of the dolphins with a harpoon. Skipper demands Frank at least put the animal out of its misery, but he can't bring himself to, so Skipper kills it, then tells Frank he's been expelled from the program and puts him ashore at the next port. The day he leaves, Frank apologizes to Skipper for the incident on the boat and is given a farewell by Gil, who gets the courage to climb up the ropes to ring the bell for Frank, which symbolizes ‚ÄòWhere we go one, we go all‚Äô. Soon after, while at sea, the brigantine encounters a freakish \\"white squall\\" storm. The vessel is battered by the seas, and the boys try to use what the Skipper has taught them to survive the horrific ordeal. Most of them succeed in abandoning the vessel, but Gil, Dean, the Skipper's wife and the cook, all drown. When the survivors are rescued and reach land, the Skipper is put on trial, with Frank's powerful parents leading the call for his license to be revoked. Eventually the Skipper refuses to allow anyone else to be blamed for the disaster, and accepts responsibility, but his former students all stand up for him, and Frank turns against his bullying parents to support the Skipper, as all the boys embrace him. The end credits explain that in reality six people died in total (four students) and dedicates the film to them.

Maurice Jarre was originally scheduled to compose the original score, but was replaced by Hans Zimmer's prot√©g√© Jeff Rona. Zimmer was set to replace Jarre but failed to commit due to time difficulties. The song in the end credits is \\"Valparaiso\\" by Sting. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 36 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"Though it gets occasionally bogged down by touchy- feely sentiment, White Squall benefits greatly from Jeff Bridges' assured lead performance and Ridley Scott's visceral, exciting direction\\".White Squall at Rotten Tomatoes White Squall, like Scott's previous film, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, was a box office disappointment. Roger Ebert gave it three stars. In his review he said \\"I enjoyed the movie for the sheer physical exuberance of its adventure.\\" Decades after White Squall's release, believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory have developed an affinity for the film because its original trailer happens to emphasize several phrases (\\"Where we go one, we go all,\\" \\"Anonymous,\\" and \\"The calm before the storm\\") which feature prominently in the conspiracy's lore.

Founded on 4 April 1999, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the company provides consumer-to-consumer (C2C), business-to- consumer (B2C), and business-to-business (B2B) sales services via web portals, as well as electronic payment services, shopping search engines and cloud computing services. It owns and operates a diverse portfolio of companies around the world in numerous business sectors. On 19 September 2014, Alibaba's initial public offering (IPO) raised US$25 billion, giving the company a market value of US$231 billion and, by far, then the largest IPO in world history. It is one of the top 10 most valuable corporations, and is named the 31st-largest public company in the world on the Forbes Global 2000 2020 list. In January 2018, Alibaba became the second Asian company to break the US$500 billion valuation mark, after its competitor Tencent. , Alibaba has the sixth- highest global brand valuation. Alibaba is the world's largest retailer and e-commerce company, and on the list of largest Internet companies. In 2020, it was also rated as the fifth-largest artificial intelligence company. It is also one of the biggest venture capital firms, and one of the biggest investment corporations in the world. The company hosts the largest B2B (Alibaba.com), C2C (Taobao), and B2C (Tmall) marketplaces in the world. Its online sales and profits have surpassed all US retailers (including Walmart, Amazon, and eBay) combined since 2015. It has been expanding into the media industry, with revenues rising by triple percentage points year after year. It also sets the record on the 2018 edition of China's Singles' Day, the world's biggest online and offline shopping day.  Naming  The company's name came from the character Ali Baba from the Middle Eastern folk-tale collection One Thousand and One Nights because of its universal appeal. As Jack Ma, one of the founders, explained: History On 4 April 1999, Jack Ma and his team of 17 friends and students founded Alibaba.com, a China-based B2B marketplace site, in his Hangzhou apartment. In October 1999, Alibaba received a US$25 million investment from Goldman Sachs and SoftBank. Alibaba.com was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market and perfect an E-Commerce platform for Chinese enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to help export Chinese products to the global market as well as address World Trade Organization (WTO) challenges. In 2002, Alibaba.com became profitable three years after launch. Ma wanted to improve the global e-commerce system, so from 2003 onward, Alibaba launched Taobao Marketplace, Alipay, Alimama.com, and Lynx. When eBay announced its expansion into China in 2003, Ma viewed the American company as a foreign competitor and rejected eBay's buyout of Alibaba's subsidiary Taobao. Through applying existing technologies and gaining trust in the Chinese e-commerce market, as well as expanding through dominating the market at a loss before making a return on additional services, Alibaba's subsidiaries outperformed eBay in the Chinese e-commerce market, claiming a growing percentage of consumers from eBay. Alibaba subsidiary Taobao would later force eBay out of the Chinese market, with eBay closing its unprofitable China Web unit, though the two companies would break even six years later. In 2005, Yahoo! invested in Alibaba through a variable interest entity (VIE) structure, buying a 40% stake in the company for US$1 billion. This would as a result net in US$10 billion in Alibaba's IPO alone to Yahoo!. According to Li Chuan, a senior executive at Alibaba, the company was planning in 2013 to open traditional brick and mortar retail outlets in partnership with Chinese real estate company Wanda Group. Additionally, Alibaba purchased a 25% stake in Hong Kong-listed Chinese department store chain Intime Retail in early 2014. In early 2017, Alibaba and Intime's founder Shen Guojun agreed to pay as much as HK$19.8 billion (US$2.6 billion) to take the store chain private. Alibaba's stake‚Äî28% from 2014's US$692 million investment‚Äîwould rise to about 74% after the deal. In April 2014, Alibaba, Coatue Management, and Andreessen Horowitz led a US$250 million Series D financing round that was completed by Lyft, bringing its total amount raised to $332.5 million. On 5 June 2014, Alibaba bought a 50% stake of Guangzhou Evergrande F.C. from Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. in a deal that was worth 1.2 billion yuan (US$192 million). On 5 September 2014, the group‚Äîin a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äîset a US$60- to $66- per-share price range for its scheduled initial public offering (IPO), the final price of which would be determined after an international roadshow to gauge the investor interest in Alibaba shares to shareholders. On 18 September 2014, Alibaba's IPO priced at US$68, raising US$21.8 billion for the company and investors. Alibaba was the biggest US IPO in history, bigger than Google, Facebook, and Twitter combined. On 19 September 2014, Alibaba's shares (BABA) began trading on the NYSE at an opening price of $92.70 at 11:55 am EST. On 22 September 2014, Alibaba's underwriters announced their confirmation that they had exercised a greenshoe option to sell 15% more shares than originally planned, boosting the total amount of the IPO to $25 billion. In January 2017, Alibaba and the International Olympic Committee jointly announced an $800 million deal that would last until 2028 in where the company would sponsor the Olympic Games. In September 2018, Jack Ma, the main founder of Alibaba, announced that he would step down as chairman in a year's time so he could focus on philanthropy. In response to the announcement, The Economist stated that Ma had a significant impact in China and worldwide via contributions and dedication to various businesses. In May 2019, Bloomberg cited sources familiar with the matter as saying that Alibaba was considering raising $20 billion through a second listing in Hong Kong. On Tuesday, 10 September 2019, Jack Ma officially stepped down as the chairman of Alibaba, Daniel Zhang succeeded him at the head of the company. In September 2019, the municipal government of Hangzhou announced that it was boosting its monitoring of the private sector by embedding government officials in Alibaba and other companies. Overall, Alibaba Group has invested in 40 unicorns, 8 decacorns, and 27 of its portfolio companies have raised more than $1 billion investments.The average portfolio company exit age is 4.6 years. Companies and affiliated entities = E-commerce and retail service platforms = Alibaba group Headquarters Binjiang Campus in Hangzhou, headquarters for Alibaba's B2B service.alt= In 1999, Jack Ma launched the primary business of Alibaba, Alibaba.com, while working as an English teacher in Hangzhou. Alibaba.com later became the world's largest online B2B trading platform for small businesses as of 2014. Alibaba.com has three main services: the English language portal Alibaba.com, which handles sales between importers and exporters from more than 240 countries and regions, the Chinese portal 1688.com, which manages domestic B2B trade in China, and transaction-based retail website AliExpress.com(ÂÖ®ÁêÉÈÄüÂçñÈÄö), which allows smaller buyers to buy small quantities of goods at wholesale prices. Alibaba.com went public at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2007, and was delisted again in 2012. In 2013, 1688.com launched a direct channel that was responsible for $30 million in daily transaction value. In 2003, Alibaba launched Taobao Marketplace (Ê∑òÂÆùÁΩë), offering a variety of products for retail sales. Taobao grew to become China's largest C2C online shopping platform and later became the second most visited web site in China, according to Alexa Internet. Taobao's growth was attributed to offering free registration and commission-free transactions using a free third-party payment platform. Advertising made up 75 percent of the company's total revenue, allowing it to break even in 2009. In 2010, Taobao's profit was estimated to be ¬•1.5 billion (US$235.7 million), which was only about 0.4 percent of their total sales figure of ¬•400 billion (US$62.9 billion) that year, way below the industry average of 2 percent, according to iResearch estimates. According to Zhang Yu, the director of Taobao, between 2011 and 2013, the number of stores on Taobao with annual sales under ¬•100 thousand increased by 60%; the number of stores with sales between ¬•10 thousand and ¬•1 million increased by 30%, and the number of stores with sales over ¬•1 million increased by 33%. In April 2008, Taobao introduced a spin-off, Taobao Mall (Ê∑òÂÆùÂïÜÂüé, later Tmall.com), an online retail platform to complement the Taobao C2C portal, offering global brands to an increasingly affluent Chinese consumer base. It became the eighth most visited web site in China as of 2013. In 2012, Tmall.com later changed its Chinese name to Tianmao (Â§©Áå´, \\"sky cat\\"), reflecting off of Tmall's Chinese pronunciation. In March 2010, Taobao launched the group shopping website Juhuasuan (ËÅöÂàíÁÆó), offering \\"flash sales\\", which are products that are available at a discount for only a fixed time period. In October 2010, Taobao beta-launched eTao, a comparison shopping website that offers search results from mostly Chinese online shopping platforms, including product searches, sales and coupon searches. According to the Alibaba Group web site, eTao offers products from Amazon China, Dangdang, Gome, Yihaodian, Nike China, and Vancl, as well as Taobao and Tmall. As part of a restructuring of Taobao by Alibaba, these spin-offs became separate companies in 2011, with Tmall and eTao becoming separate businesses in June and Juhuasuan becoming a separate business later in October. In 2010, Alibaba launched AliExpress.com, an online retail service made up of mostly small Chinese businesses offering products to international online buyers. It is the most visited E-Commerce platform in Russia. It allows small businesses in China to sell to customers all over the world, resulting in a wide variety of products. It might be more accurate to compare AliExpress to eBay, though, as sellers are independent; it simply serves as a host for other businesses to sell to consumers. Similar to eBay, sellers on Aliexpress can be either companies or individuals. It connects directly Chinese businesses with buyers. The main difference from Taobao is that it's aimed primarily at international buyers, mainly in USA, Russia, Brazil or Spain. In 2013, Alibaba and six large Chinese logistics companies (including SF Express) established a company called Cainiao for delivery of packages in China. This network gradually grew to 14 local logistics companies in 2014. In 2016, Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall, two of the world's largest and most popular online retail marketplaces, achieved a total transaction volume of 3 trillion yuan (US$478.6 billion). The company aims to double the transaction volume to 6 trillion yuan by 2020. , Taobao reached 580 million monthly active users, while Tmall achieved 500 million monthly active users. It is also rapidly expanding its e-commerce network abroad. Alibaba has also announced that it will invest 100 billion yuan over five years to build a global logistics network, underpinning an aggressive overseas expansion, and demonstrating Alibaba's commitment to building the most efficient logistics network in China and around the world. It is investing a further 5.3 billion yuan in Cainiao Logistics to boost its stake to 51 percent from 47 percent. The investment would value Cainiao, a joint venture of top Chinese logistics firms, at around US$20 billion. On 11 June 2014, Alibaba launched US shopping site 11 Main. The 11 Main marketplace hosts more than 1,000 merchants in categories such as clothing, fashion accessories and jewelry as well as interior goods and arts and crafts and it plans to keep adding more, said the company. On 23 June 2015, Alibaba announced that it is selling 11 Main to OpenSky, an online-marketplace operator based in New York. Lazada warehouse in Cabuyao, Laguna, Philippines during the company's 11.11 sale promotion in 2018. Lazada Group is a subsidiary of Alibaba Group and Alibaba co-founder Lucy Peng Lei is CEO of the company. In April 2016, Alibaba announced that it intended to acquire a controlling interest in Lazada by paying $500 million for new shares and buying $500M worth of shares from existing investors. Lazada Group is a Singaporean e-commerce company founded by Rocket Internet in 2011. Lazada operates sites in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its sites launched in March 2012, with a business model of selling inventory to customers from its own warehouses. In 2013 it added a marketplace model that allowed third-party retailers to sell their products through Lazada's site. Lazada features a wide product offering in categories ranging from consumer electronics to household goods, toys, fashion and sports equipment. In March 2018, Alibaba announced its plan to invest an additional $2 billion in the company, totaling a $4 billion investment. Alibaba also plans to appoint Alibaba co-founder Lucy Peng as Lazada's new CEO. In October 2016, Alibaba launched Alitrip, later named Fliggy, an online travel platform that is designed as an online mall for brands such as airline companies and agencies. Fliggy set the target audience as younger generation and it strives to become a one-stop service when they plan their trips, particularly in overseas travel. On 7 August 2017, Alibaba Group and Marriott International hotel group announced a comprehensive strategic co-operation. Two companies will set up a joint venture company. Through the docking technology system and the superiority resources, Fliggy has Marriott hotel flagship store. It has the same function with Marriott Chinese website and Marriott mobile app to create the best global travel experience for consumers. In 2017, Alibaba started opening a chain of supermarkets, named Hema (ÁõíÈ©¨, lit. box horse), as part of the company's \\"new retail strategy,\\" where customers can either order in the store or online for delivery in under 30 minutes. It offers a mobile app that recommends customers products based on data analytics. In addition, customers can have their groceries cooked to eat in the food court of the supermarket. = Cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology = In conjunction with the company's 10th anniversary, Alibaba launched Alibaba Cloud in September 2009, aiming to build a cloud computing service platform, including e-commerce data mining, e-commerce data processing, and data customization.

Alibaba claim it is capable of 78,563 images per second (IPS) inference and 500 IPS/W in ResNet-50. The Hanguang 800 will be available to be rented on Alibaba Cloud. = FinTech and online payment platforms = Food ordered with Alipay In 2004, the Alibaba Group launched Alipay, a third-party online payment platform with no transaction fees. It also provides an escrow service, in which buyers can verify whether they are happy with goods they have bought before releasing money to the seller. Alibaba Group spun off Alipay in 2010 in a controversial move. According to analyst research report, Alipay has the biggest market share in China with 300 million users and control of just under half of China's online payment market in February 2014. In 2013, Alipay launched a financial product platform called Yu'ebao (‰ΩôÈ¢ùÂÆù). In 2015, Alibaba announced that they will introduce a system that can be paid by recognizing the owner's face. On 16 October 2014, the Alipay company was re-branded as Ant Financial Services. One of the factors for Alibaba's success in this platform is the company's quick and reliable payment system, where it offers several types of payment systems such as credit card, debit card, Alipay, Quick-pay, and online banking. These payment systems help to cope with simultaneous cash flow transactions with ease and convenience. Ant Financial was ranked sixth in Fortune's Change the World list, recognized for the positive green environmental impact of its Ant Forest, the world's largest platform for tracking individuals' carbon footprints.

In December 2015, Alibaba agreed to acquire the South China Morning Post and other media assets belonging to the group for a consideration of $266 million. Although Alibaba promised editorial independence, vice-chairman Joseph Tsai said that Alibaba believes that \\"the world needs a plurality of views when it comes to China coverage. China's rise as an economic power and its importance to world stability is too important for there to be a singular thesis.\\" The acquisition attracted media concerns over what this would mean for the newspaper's coverage. Other subsidiaries of Alibaba include Hangzhou Ali Venture Capital and Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund. Hangzhou Ali Venture Capital (Êù≠Â∑ûÈòøÈáåÂàõ‰∏öÊäïËµÑ) is a company 80% owned by Jack Ma and another manager of Alibaba.

Corporate governance alt=Alibaba's main co-founder Jack Ma is the former executive chairman of the Alibaba Group from its creation to 10 September 2019. The current executive chairman is Daniel Zhang, who succeeded Ma on 10 September 2019, and is also Alibaba's CEO since 2015. Joseph Tsai is Alibaba's executive vice-chairman since 2013. J. Michael Evans is Alibaba's president since 2015. The board of directors of Alibaba includes top management Jack Ma, Joseph Tsai, Daniel Zhang, and J. Michael Evans, and director Eric Jing, plus independent directors such as Chee Hwa Tung, Walter Kwauk, B√∂rje E. Ekholm, and Wan Ling Martello, as well as Yahoo! co-founder and former CEO Jerry Yang. Masayoshi Son (founder and CEO of SoftBank) formerly served on the firm's board before stepping down in 2020. Besides Ma, Tsai, Zhang, and Evans, senior management also includes Maggie Wu (CFO) Judy Tong (CPO), Jeff Zhang (CTO and President of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence), Sophie Wu (CCO), Tim Steinert (General Counsel and Secretary), Jessie Zheng (CRO and CRGO/Chief Platform Governance Officer), Angel Zhao (Head of Alibaba Globalization Leadership Group), Chris Tung (CMO), Trudy Dai (President of Wholesale Marketplaces), Fan Jiang (President of Taobao.com), and Jet Jing (President of Tmall.com). Previously, Jack Ma served as the CEO of the Alibaba Group since its creation, but later stepped down in 2013, choosing Jonathan Lu as his successor. The Alibaba Group under Lu was performing well, though there were rumors that Ma was growing distrustful in Lu's ability to lead the company. Daniel Zhang, who served as COO of Alibaba under Lu, succeeded Lu as CEO in 2015. On 10 September 2018, Ma chose Zhang to succeed him as executive chairman of the Alibaba Group after his stepping down announcement, and this would go into effect in 1 year on 10 September 2019. Since 2012, the Communist Party of China has had a Group Party Committee in place in the company and has over 2,000 party members as Alibaba employees. In 2019, the Chinese government began embedding officials inside of major technology companies, including Alibaba. Controversies =Gold Supplier membership= Alibaba.com offers a paid Gold Supplier membership to try to ensure that each seller is genuine; sellers' Gold Supplier status and the number of years it has been held are displayed. The supplier verification types and checks are listed on Alibaba.com's website, with more stringent checks for sellers outside China. While the majority of suppliers are reported to be genuine, there have been many cases of sellers, some with Gold Supplier status, seeking to defraud unsuspecting buyers. In February 2011, controversy ensued when Alibaba's corporate office admitted that it had granted the mark of integrity of its \\"China Gold Supplier\\" program to more than 2,000 dealers that had subsequently defrauded buyers; the firm's share price dropped \\"abruptly\\" after the announcement. A statement from the firm reported that Yan Limin, the general manager of Alibaba.com at the time, had been dismissed in March for \\"misconduct\\"; Phil Muncaster of UK's The Register additionally reported that \\"a further 28 employees had been involved in dodgy dealings\\". As the Economist noted, the company's response has conflicting components: Alibaba's promulgated view that its corrective actions indicate its commitment to quality and integrity (where it contrasts itself with other scandal-associated Chinese business sectors), versus a damage control view suggesting that the subscription-driven, third-party verified \\"China Gold Supplier\\" program was endangered by diminished trust in its endorsement system, removing the incentive for global buyers to choose Alibaba as their business-to-business service, thus more broadly endangering Alibaba through impact on its brand and capabilities (the latter via the \\"defenestration of senior people\\"). The scandal was said to have placed the head of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma‚Äîwho was described as having been furious over the scandal‚Äîin a position to personally fight to win back trust. =Counterfeit products= In 2016, the Office of the United States Trade Representative added Taobao back onto a list of notorious counterfeit platforms that includes the likes of torrent site The Pirate Bay. Alibaba denied wrongdoing and filed two lawsuits against the counterfeiters , but brands whose sales have been affected by the counterfeit products accussed Alibaba of not doing enough. =Class action lawsuit on IPO= Alibaba and the underwriters of its IPO were sued in a California superior court in a consolidated class action lawsuit.

A chalcogenide is a chemical compound consisting of at least one chalcogen anion and at least one more electropositive element. Although all group 16 elements of the periodic table are defined as chalcogens, the term chalcogenide is more commonly reserved for sulfides, selenides, tellurides, and polonides, rather than oxides. Many metal ores exist as chalcogenides. Photoconductive chalcogenide glasses are used in xerography. Some pigments and catalysts are also based on chalcogenides. The metal dichalcogenide MoS2 is a common solid lubricant. Alkali metal and alkaline earth chalcogenides Alkali metal and alkaline earth monochalcogenides are salt-like, being colourless and often water-soluble. The sulfides tend to undergo hydrolysis to form derivatives containing bisulfide (SH‚àí) anions. The alkali metal chalcogenides often crystallize with the antifluorite structure and the alkaline earth salts in the sodium chloride motif. :The zinc blende structure is a common motif for metal monochalcogenides. Transition metal chalcogenides Transition metal chalcogenides occur with many stoichiometries and many structures.Vaughan, D. J.; Craig, J. R. ‚ÄúMineral Chemistry of Metal Sulfides\\" Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1978. . Most common and most important technologically, however, are the chalcogenides of simple stoichiometries, such as 1:1 and 1:2. Extreme cases include metal-rich phases (e.g. Ta2S), which exhibit extensive metal-metal bonding, and chalcogenide- rich materials such as Re2S7, which features extensive chalcogen-chalcogen bonding. For the purpose of classifying these materials, the chalcogenide is often viewed as a dianion, i.e., S2‚àí, Se2‚àí, Te2‚àí, and Po2‚àí. In fact, transition metal chalcogenides are highly covalent, not ionic, as indicated by their semiconducting properties. =Metal-rich chalcogenides= Structure of the metal-rich sulfide Nb21S8. In most of their chalcogenides, transition metals adopt oxidation states of II or greater. Nonetheless, several examples exist where the metallic atoms far outnumber the chalcogens. Such compounds typically have extensive metal-metal bonding. =Monochalcogenides= Metal monochalcogenides have the formula ME, where M = a transition metal and E = S, Se, Te. They typically crystallize in one of two motifs, named after the corresponding forms of zinc sulfide. In the zinc blende structure, the sulfide atoms pack in a cubic symmetry and the Zn2+ ions occupy half of the tetrahedral holes. The result is a diamondoid framework. The main alternative structure for the monochalcogenides is the wurtzite structure wherein the atom connectivities are similar (tetrahedral), but the crystal symmetry is hexagonal. A third motif for metal monochalcogenide is the nickel arsenide lattice, where the metal and chalcogenide each have octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination, respectively. This motif is commonly subject to nonstoichiometry.\\"Sulfide Mineralogy: Volume 1\\" Paul H. Ribbe, editor, 1974, Mineralogical Society of America. Important monochalcogenides include some pigments, notably cadmium sulfide. Many minerals and ores are monosulfides.Greenwood, N. N.; & Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. . =Dichalcogenides= Metal dichalcogenides have the formula ME2, where M = a transition metal and E = S, Se, Te.Wells, A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press. . As usual, the most important members are the sulfides. They are always dark diamagnetic solids, insoluble in all solvents, and exhibiting semiconducting properties. In terms of their electronic structures, these compounds are usually viewed as derivatives of M4+, where M4+ = Ti4+ (d0 configuration), V4+ (d1 configuration), Mo4+ (d2 configuration). Titanium disulfide was investigated in prototype cathodes for secondary batteries, exploiting its ability to reversibly undergo intercalation by lithium. Molybdenum disulfide, the subject of many thousand publications, is the main ore of molybdenum where it is called molybdenite. It is used as a solid lubricant and catalyst for hydrodesulfurization. The corresponding diselenides and even ditellurides are known, e.g., TiSe2, MoSe2, and WSe2. :MoS2, the most common metal dichalcogenide, adopts a layered structure. Transition metal dichalcogenides typically adopt either cadmium diiodide or molybdenum disulfide structures. In the CdI2 motif, the metals exhibit octahedral structures. In the MoS2 motif, which is not observed for dihalides, the metals exhibit trigonal prismatic structures. The strong bonding between the metal and chalcogenide ligands, contrasts with the weak chalcogenide‚Äîchalcogenide bonding between the layers. Owing to these contrasting bond strengths, these materials engage in intercalation by alkali metals. The intercalation process is accompanied by charge transfer, reducing the M(IV) centers to M(III). Pyrite and related disulfides In contrast to classical metal dichalcogenides, iron pyrite, a common mineral, is usually described as consisting of Fe2+ and the persulfido anion S22‚àí. The sulfur atoms within the disulfido dianion are bound together via a short S-S bond. \\"Late\\" transition metal disulfides (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) almost always adopt the pyrite or the related marcasite motif, in contrast to early metals (V, Ti, Mo, W) which adopt 4+ oxidation state with two chalcogenide dianions. =Tri- and tetrachalcogenides= Several metals, mainly for the early metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn groups) also form trichalcogenides. These materials are usually described as M4+(E22‚àí)(E2‚àí) (where E = S, Se, Te). A well known example is niobium triselenide. Amorphous MoS3 is produced by treatment of tetrathiomolybdate with acid: :MoS42‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ ‚Üí MoS3 \\\\+ H2S The mineral patr√≥nite, which has the formula VS4, is an example of a metal tetrachalcogenide. Crystallographic analysis shows that the material can be considered a bis(persulfide), i.e. V4+,(S22‚àí)2. Main group chalcogenides :As2S3 is a crosslinked polymer where the As and S centers obey the octet rule. Chalcogen derivatives are known for all of the main group elements except the noble gases. Usually, their stoichiometries follow the classical valence trends, e.g. SiS2, B2S3, Sb2S3. Many exceptions exist however, e.g. P4S3 and S4N4. The structures of many main group materials are dictated by directional covalent bonding, rather than by close packing. The chalcogen is assigned positive oxidation states for the halides, nitrides, and oxides.

He is most often associated with the Vancouver School. Work Coming out of Vancouver's 1970s photoconceptual tradition, Rodney Graham's work is often informed by historical literary, musical, philosophical and popular references. He is most often associated with other West-coast Canadian artists, including Vikky Alexander, Jeff Wall, Stan Douglas, Roy Arden and Ken Lum. He was taught by fellow Vancouver school artist Ian Wallace while at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, from 1979 to 1980. Around this time, he played electric guitar in the band UJ3RK5 with fellow artist Jeff Wall on keyboards and Ian Wallace on electric bass, among others. His wide-ranging and often genre-busting work has frequently engaged with technologies of the past: literary, psychological and musical texts, optical devices, and film as an historical medium. Among his earliest works is Camera Obscura (1979; destroyed 1981) a site-specific work that consisted of a shed-sized optical device on his family's farm field near Abbotsford, British Columbia. Entering the shed, the observer was confronted with an inverted image of a solitary tree.Wall, \\"Into the Forest: Two Sketches for Studies of Rodney Graham's Work,\\" 21. Both prior to this (with Rome Ruins [1978])Graham, \\"Artist's Notes,\\" in Rodney Graham: Works from 1976 to 1994. Toronto; Brussels; Chicago: Art Gallery of York University; Yves Gevaert; The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, 1994. 83. and throughout the 1980s and 90s, Graham employed the technique of the camera obscura in his work. Beginning in the early 1980s, Graham took found texts as the basis for his bookworks‚Äîat once conceptual and material‚Äîinserting bookmarks with additional pages, inserting textual loops or incorporating books into optical devices in works such as Dr. No* (1991), Lenz (1983) and Reading Machine for Lenz (1993) respectively. Many of these were carried out with esteemed Belgian publisher Yves Gevaert and/or the gallerist Christine Burgin. His extensive body of work related to Sigmund Freud (beginning in 1983) has developed out of this text-based practice, though, later, found object books would be integrated unmodified into Donald Judd-like sculptures, for example The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (1987). Until 1997, when he represented Canada at the Venice Biennale with the film loop Vexation Island, Graham was most well known for his series of photographs of Welsh oaks seen upside-down.Apollinaire Schepp (September 16, 2001), Taking a Trip by Bicycle New York Times. For this project, he employed a photographer to take black and white negatives of majestic, isolated trees in the English countrysideRodney Graham, Welsh Oaks #1 (1998) Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. with a large-format camera. He then hung the pictures upside down, like camera obscura images.Ken Johnson (November 4, 2005), A Mercurial Conceptualist Who Remains an Enigma New York Times. In 1998 Graham produced his definitive work on this theme, a series of seven monumental images of Welsh oaks printed on color paper to produce warm deep sepia and charcoal hues.Rodney Graham, Welsh Oaks #1 (1998) Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. A postage stamp depicting Graham's photograph, Basement Camera Shop circa 1937 was issued on March 22, 2013 by Canada Post as part of their Canadian Photography series. The image is a recreation of a snapshot discovered by the artist at an antique store. Graham places himself in the photograph as the owner standing at the counter, waiting for a customer. =Film= In 1994, Graham began a series of films and videos in which he himself appears as the principal character: Halcion Sleep (1994), Vexation Island (1997) (shown at Canadian pavilion of the 1997 Venice Biennale), How I Became a Ramblin' Man (1999), and The Phonokinetoscope (2002). In The Phonokinetoscope Graham's engagement with the origins of cinema and its eventual demise surface. In this work, Graham takes up a prototype by Thomas Edison and puts forward an argument for the relation between sound and image in film. In Vexation Island (1997), a shipwrecked sailor, played by Graham, wakes up on a tropical island only to be knocked unconscious by a falling coconut that he has succeeded in shaking out of a palm tree; after a while he reawakens, returns to the tree and the cycle repeats.Ken Johnson (November 4, 2005), A Mercurial Conceptualist Who Remains an Enigma New York Times. Later, in Rheinmetall/Victoria 8 (2003), two increasingly obsolete technologies, the typewriter and film projector, face off against one another‚Äîwith the latter projecting a film of the former. The film Lobbing Potatoes at a Gong (1969) (2006), shot on 16mm and presented as a looped projection, fictitiously documents a 1969 performance strongly reminiscent of the Fluxus movement. The artist, played by Graham, is shown sitting on a chair in the setting of an alternative cultural institution, with an audience watching him trying to hit a gong with potatoes. All the potatoes that actually hit the gong were subsequently used to produce vodka in a small still. The bottle is displayed in a showcase, both an end product and part of the work. As in many of Graham's films, the relatively simple plot is in stark contrast to the effort that went into the production, with the artist conducting extensive research and hiring a professional film crew. =Drawing and painting= In 2003, Graham turned to drawing and painting for the first time. Adopting a persona in a host of related photographic, installation and painted works, The Gifted Amateur, November 10, 1962, 2007, indicates both continuing performative and art historical directions in his work. In 2009, Graham exhibited a series of film installations with Harun Farocki, called \\"HF/RG,\\" at the Jeu de Paume, Paris. Exhibitions Graham's solo exhibitions include the Vancouver Art Gallery (2012); a retrospective at MACBA, Barcelona (2010), travelling to Hamburger Kunsthalle and the Museum f√ºr Gegenwartskunst, Basel; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2004); Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia (2005), Whitechapel Gallery, London (2002), and Hamburger Bahnhof Berlin (2001). The artist was included in documenta IX (1992), the Venice Biennale in 1997, the Whitney Biennial in 2006, and the Carnegie International in 2013. Recognition Graham represented Canada at the 47th Venice Biennale (1997) and among awards he has received the Gershon Iskowitz Prize, Toronto (2004), the Kurt Schwitters-Preis, Nieders√§chsiche Sparkassenstiftung, Germany (2006) and the Audain Prize for lifetime achievement in visual arts, British Columbia (2011).Rodney Graham Lisson Gallery, London/Milan. In 2016, he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada for his contributions to Canadian contemporary visual arts.  Personal life  Graham lives in Vancouver and is married to the artist Shannon Oksanen. Though they have not divorced, she lives separately with her two children and their father.

Biography Michael Sherwood was a US keyboardist and singer who came from a musical family which included his father Bobby Sherwood, who was an actor, musician, and big band leader; his mother Phyllis, a drummer and singer; and younger brother Billy (Yes, ASIA). His father gave him his first keyboard when he was four years old. Sherwood (keys, vocals) formed the band Lodgic with Jimmy Haun on guitar in 1977, while growing up in Las Vegas. Also in the band were Mark and Tom Fletcher, and Gary Starns on drums. The band would later include Guy Allison on keyboards (from 1979) and brother Billy (bass, later also vocals). Billy was originally recruited to play less \\"busy\\" bass parts than their then bass player. The band covered Return to Forever, Peter Frampton, Frank Zappa and Yes. They eventually moved the band to Los Angeles in 1980, managed by Barry Morgan, and around the same time began writing their own material. The band met Jeff Porcaro, who along with other members of Toto, mentored them. After many years of trying to get things together, they recorded their debut album Nomadic Sands, released in 1986. The album was to be produced by David Paich and David Foster, then by Paich and James Newton Howard, before eventually being produced by Paich and Steve Porcaro. Sherwood worked with Toto keyboardist Steve Porcaro during this period; one of their co-writes was considered for Michael Jackson's Thriller album. It was not used at the time, but was then finished for inclusion on Thriller 25. Michael Sherwood and Jimmy Haun then worked with Air Supply. Sherwood worked on The Earth Is ... (1991), The Vanishing Race (1993) and News from Nowhere (1995). Sherwood did session work, including backing vocals on the Anderson/Bruford/Wakeman/Howe songs on Yes's Union album (on which brother Billy also performed, but on a different track). A solo album, Tangletown, was released in 1998, largely written with Julius Robinson, and included artists Steve McCormick (guitars and vocals), the late Jamie Chez (drums and vocals), Tom Felicetta (long-haired bass), and Dorian Crozier (drums on \\"Angry as I Am\\" and \\"The Censor\\"). Guests included Christian Nesmith, who co-produced with drummer Jamie Chez and bassist Tom Felicetta, brother Billy, Jimmy Haun, Greg Ellis, and Yes engineer Tom Fletcher.Tangletown jacket notes, 1998 Sherwood also appeared on Ted Jacobs' 2000 album The Days Gone By, while he and Robinson worked on music for the 2001 film Angel Eyes. In 2004, he joined Conspiracy, Billy's band with Yes bassist Chris Squire, to record a live-in- the-studio DVD, released in 2006. Sherwood has also worked with the Gluey Brothers, Jack Russell, Lisa Loeb, Steve Porcaro, Air Supply, Jonathan Elias, and Circa, and further with Julius Robinson and Christian Nesmith. He has done music for TV shows and adverts, including work for Elias Associates. Sherwood co-wrote, co-produced and sings on Steve Porcaro's debut solo album Someday/Somehow, released 2016, as well as co-writing material for Toto XIV. He unexpectedly died on 5 November 2019, at the age of 60 years old.

Vibration manifests itself as a high frequency periodic movement of the roll body with an amplitude from less than one to several ¬µm. When anti-vibration compound is introduced to the center bores of the rolls, vibration is transferred from the solid roll structure to the incompressible fluid component of the anti-vibration compound. Its solid particles are less mobile due to their inertia. Thus the fluid is forced to oscillate around the solid components. The flow energy is absorbed by micro eddies by which the vibration is damped.

History Despite the Public Libraries Act 1850 it was not until the 1870s that serious thought was given to the creation of a free public library in Reading. Reading Borough Council could not agree to raise the rate necessary to fund a library and as a result in 1875 William Isaac Palmer, of the Huntley & Palmers biscuit firm decided to personally fund the setting up and running of a Free Library in West Street. This proved very popular and won over opponents of free libraries, leading to the adoption of the Public Libraries Act in Reading in 1877 and the beginning of the library service. While the contents of Reading Free Library were donated by Palmer to the borough, it was decided that a new building was needed. A new library was included in the plans drawn up in 1879 for an extension to the Reading Town Hall which would also include a new museum (later to become the Museum of Reading). This new Library opened in October 1882 and soon proved very popular. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, responsibility for library services was transferred to Berkshire County Council, which was itself abolished in 1996 as part of a local government reform, and the functions returned to the borough council. Gradually library provision extended throughout Reading with the building of more libraries in other parts of the town. Today the library service has seven branches and also runs the library service in Reading Remand Centre.

Devil in a Blue Dress is a 1990 hardboiled mystery novel by Walter Mosley, his first published book. The text centers on the main character, Ezekiel \\"Easy\\" Rawlins, and his transformation from a day laborer into a detective.  Plot  Set in 1948, the story begins in the Watts area of Los Angeles, with Ezekiel \\"Easy\\" Rawlins, a Houstonian - from that city's Fifth Ward - who lost his job at an aviation defense plant in Los Angeles and is unable to pay the mortgage on his LA home. Easy is sitting in a bar run by Joppy, a friend who is also from Houston, when a man named DeWitt Albright walks into the bar and offers him Easy job finding a young white woman named Daphne Monet, is rumored to be hanging out in bars frequented mostly by African Americans, although white women are allowed inside. At the bar, Easy meets two old friends, Coretta and Dupree, among many other people that he knew from his former life in Houston. Coretta says that she knows Daphne, but gives an incorrect address to Easy. He goes home with them and has sex with Coretta, while Dupree is asleep in the next room. Easy then leaves her early the next morning, only to be arrested by the LAPD. Shortly thereafter, following police interrogation, Easy is told that Coretta is dead, and that he is a suspect in her murder. When Easy finally does find Monet, he figures out that she has stolen a large amount of money from a man named Todd Carter, who is a local wealthy businessman. Albright wanted to claim it for himself. Eventually, Albright finds Monet through Easy, who is trying to shield the thieving woman. Easy enlists the help of a friend and fellow Houstonian, Mouse, who shows up due to a half- hearted invitation from Easy, and domestic strife back home. Easy and Mouse find Monet with Albright and Joppy. They rescue her, and kill Joppy and Albright. Then Mouse reveals that Monet is actually Ruby, an African-American woman passing as white, and the sister of a local gangster named Green. Mouse and Easy blackmail Ruby, taking her money and dividing it into thirds for each of them. Daphne/Ruby leaves shortly thereafter, and Easy has to clean up the mess with the police, as well as Carter, who had initially hired Albright to find her, since he really did love her and not his money. Easy approaches Carter and requests his help with the police. He blackmails him by saying that he will leak the information about his love for a black woman unless he is protected from the law. Carter does so. At the conclusion, Mouse returns to Houston, Easy takes up detective work, and Ruby disappears.Lisa Respers France, \\"Crime writer Walter Mosley debuts new series\\", CNN, April 6, 2009.

He is drawn into a mystery by Albright, who hires him to locate Monet, telling him that it is on behalf of a wealthy businessman named Todd Carter. Easy has no interest in life as a detective, but his tutelage under Albright encourages him to consider doing 'favors' for people as an ongoing career. * Raymond \\"Mouse\\" Alexander is Easy's best friend, described as dangerous and deadly. Easy calls Mouse to assist him when the case becomes dangerous, but Mouse's deadly nature forces Easy to question whether this is the right decision. * Daphne Monet is the young woman who has gone missing in the Watts neighborhood of LA; Easy is tasked with finding her, and as a result, gets caught up in the intrigue. * Dewitt Albright is the white private investigator who hires Easy to find Monet. * Frank Green is a criminal in the Watts neighborhood, who is known for his skills with a knife. He is connected to Monet, and a person of interest in Easy's investigation. * Jackson Blue is Easy's intelligent and cowardly friend, who assists him with information on his case. * Matthew Teran is a pedophile who recently dropped out of the mayor's race. He keeps a little Mexican boy as a sex slave, and is grotesque in appearance. He tries to use Daphne to get back at Carter, who forced him to withdraw his candidacy. * Odell Jones is Easy's quiet, cautious, religious middle-aged friend. He is wont to sit at John's or Vernie's, and sip one beer all night. He is also a voice of fear, advising Easy to run away from his problems. * Todd Carter is a well-connected white man who has a relationship with Monet. The president of Lion Investments, he is a humble- looking, weak-willed man with more money than any other character. He dated Monet until she stole $30,000 from him and vanished. He hires Albright, and later Easy, to bring Monet back to him. He also helps Easy to avoid jail time.  Analysis  The novel is an important contribution to African-American and ethnic detective fiction in that it focuses on a black protagonist who falls into the role of detective, but by the series' end, has made his own both the profession and the identity that often comes along with it. Particularly noteworthy are Easy's use of African-American English and the emergence of 'the Voice' (an inner voice that advises Easy during particularly stressful or dangerous situations).Genie Giaimo, \\"Talking back through ‚Äòtalking Black‚Äô: African American English and agency in Walter Mosley‚Äôs Devil In a Blue Dress\\", Language and Literature, August 2010, vol. 19, no. 3, pp. 235‚Äì247.

The batter is also not out while their innings is still in progress. Occurrence At least one batter is not out at the end of every innings, because once ten batters are out, the eleventh has no partner to bat on with so the innings ends. Usually two batters finish not out if the batting side declares in first-class cricket, and often at the end of the scheduled number of overs in limited overs cricket. Batters further down the batting order than the not out batters do not come out to the crease at all and are noted as did not bat rather than not out; by contrast, a batter who comes to the crease but faces no balls is not out. A batter who retires hurt is considered not out; an uninjured batter who retires (rare) is considered retired out. Notation In standard notation a batter's score is appended with an asterisk to show the not out final status; for example, 10* means '10 not out'. Impact on batting averages Batting averages are personal and are calculated as runs divided by dismissals, so a player who often ends the innings not out may get an inflated batting average, on the face of it. Examples of this include MS Dhoni (82 not outs in ODIs), Michael Bevan (67 not outs in ODIs), James Anderson (74 not outs in 189 Test innings), and Bill Johnston topping the batting averages on the 1953 Australian tour of England. Two independent counter-factors can mean the simple batting average formula understates performance: *If not outs were counted as dismissals a usually high-scoring batter could bat briefly. They may regularly make a low score, not out, facing a low number of balls from a bowler and thus be penalised for factors out of their control. *A batter will tend to be at their most vulnerable early in the innings before they have \\"got their eye in\\"; as a result, it may be a greater achievement to achieve two scores of 20 not out and 20 (i.e. averaging 40) than to make one score of 40, since in the latter instance the batter will only have had to deal with one set of variables (see ceteris paribus, all things remaining approximately equal). These counterbalancing elements have been at the heart of the rationale of keeping the existing simple formula in the 21st century among cricket statisticians, who have used this method of collecting batting averages since the 18th century, after some intervening controversy.

Their food is smaller fish and crustaceans (shrimp). Typically throughout the species, the maximum size is and the maximum weight . The body is fusiform (tapering spindle shape) and oval in cross-section; being slightly laterally compressed, and the eyes are large and partially covered with adipose eyelids. Like those of eels, the larvae are leptocephalic - being highly compressed, ribbon-like, and transparent. After initial growth, they shrink and then metamorphose into the adult form. This family is fished, but their bodies are bony, so these fish are not marketed widely for consumption. They are caught and used as bait or may be ground down for fish meal.

Before this, Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, had announced in October 1929 a vague offer of 'dominion status' for British- occupied India in an unspecified future and a Round Table Conference to discuss a future constitution. The second Round Table Conference was held from September to December 1931 in London. \\"The Two Leaders\\"‚Äîas Sarojini Naidu described Gandhi and Lord Irwin‚Äîhad eight meetings that totaled 24 hours. Gandhi was impressed by Irwin‚Äôs sincerity. The terms of the \\"Gandhi-Irwin Pact\\" fell manifestly short of those Gandhi prescribed as the minimum for a truce. Below are the proposed conditions:- * Discontinuation of Salt March by the Indian National Congress * Participation by the Indian National Congress in the Second Round Table Conference * Withdrawal of all ordinances issued by the Government of India imposing curbs on the activities of the Indian National Congress * Withdrawal of all prosecutions relating to several types of offenses except those involving violence * Release of prisoners arrested for participating in the Salt March. * Removal of the tax on salt, which allowed the Indians to produce, trade, and sell salt legally and for their own private use Many British officials in India, and in Great Britain, were outraged by the idea of a pact with a party whose avowed purpose was the destruction of the British Raj. Winston Churchill publicly expressed his disgust \\"...at the nauseating and humiliating spectacle of this one-time Inner Temple lawyer, now seditious fakir, striding half-naked up the steps of the Viceroy‚Äôs palace, there to negotiate and parley on equal terms with the representative of the King Emperor.\\" In reply, His Majesty's Government agreed to:- # Withdraw all ordinances and end prosecutions # Release all political prisoners, except those guilty of violence # Permit peaceful picketing of liquor and foreign cloth shops # Restore confiscated properties of the satyagrahis # Permit free collection or manufacture of salt by persons near the sea-coast # Lift the ban over the Congress. The Viceroy, Lord Irwin, was at this time directing the sternest repression Indian nationalism had known, but did not relish the role. The British-run Indian Civil Service and the commercial community favoured even harsher measures. But Ramsay MacDonald, the British Prime Minister, and William Benn, His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for India, were eager for peace, if they could secure it without weakening the position of the Labour government in Whitehall. They wanted to make a success of the Round Table Conference and knew that this body, without the presence of Gandhi and the Congress, could not carry much weight. In January 1931, at the closing session of the Round Table Conference, Ramsay MacDonald went so far as to express the hope that the Congress would be represented at the next session. The Viceroy took the hint and promptly ordered the unconditional release of Gandhi and all members of the Congress Working Committee. To this gesture Gandhi responded by agreeing to meet the Viceroy. Gandhi‚Äôs motives in concluding a pact with Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, can be best understood in terms of his technique. The satyagraha movements were commonly described as \\"struggles\\", \\"rebellions\\" and \\"wars without violence\\". Owing, however, to the common connotation of these words, they seemed to lay a disproportionate emphasis on the negative aspect of the movements, namely, opposition and conflict. The object of satyagraha was, however, not to achieve the physical elimination or moral breakdown of an adversary‚Äîbut, through suffering at his hands, to initiate a psychological processes that could make it possible for minds and hearts to meet. In such a struggle, a compromise with an opponent was neither heresy nor treason, but a natural and necessary step. If it turned out that the compromise was premature and the adversary was unrepentant, nothing prevented the satyagrahi from returning to non-violent battle. This was the second high-level meeting between Gandhi and a Viceroy in 13 years and should be read in the context of the Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms that were the basis of the Government of India Act, 1919.

Other nearby neighbourhoods are Priesthill to the north, Southpark Village to the south, and South Nitshill and Parkhouse to the west; there is also a small industrial estate. The closest railway station is . The Brock Burn flows through the area. History The historic estate of Darnley (anciently Derneley, etc.), in Eastwood parish, Renfrewshire, east of Barrhead, was the seat of an ancient barony.Frances Groome, Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, 1882-4 In 1356, Robert Stewart, High Steward of Scotland, granted the barony to Sir John Stewart. It remained a possession of this branch of the house of Stewart (known as \\"Stewart of Darnley\\"), and in 1460 Sir John Stewart of Darnley (d. 1495) became \\"Lord Darnley\\" (a Scottish Lordship of Parliament) and subsequently in 1488 he was created Earl of Lennox (2nd creation). His descendant in the fourth generation was Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley (1546-67), the second but eldest surviving son of Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, (the courtesy title \\"Lord Darnley\\", his father's subsidiary title, designating him as heir apparent to the Earldom of Lennox), and the husband of Mary Queen of Scots by whom he was the father of King James VI of Scotland, I of England. The title Earl of Darnley has been created twice. The 1675 creation was as a subsidiary title for Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox (1672-1723), of Goodwood House in Sussex, an illegitimate son of King Charles II, who in the early 18th century sold the estate of Darnley to the Duke of Montrose.Frances Groome, Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, 1882-4 It was sold again in 1757 to Sir John Maxwell of Pollok, and in 1884 belonged to Stirling- Maxwell of Pollok and Keir, at which time it gave a prefix name to several seats of manufacture and other localities within its limits.Frances Groome, Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, 1882-4 During the second half of the 20th century, Darnley experienced total transformation from being a modest semi- rural communityDarnley Renfrewshire, Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, 1882 (Vision of Britain Through Time)Darnley Bleachfield and Upper Darnley (Pollok House, 1830), the Glasgow Story to becoming a significant part of Glasgow's response to a post-war housing shortage. Following the construction of large housing schemes at South Nitshill (1957) and Kennishead (1966), the City of Glasgow approved the building of 2,048 homes in Darnley in 1968. This scheme was to occupy an area to the north of Nitshill Road covered by Leggatston Farm, part of the original Darnley estate taken within the City of Glasgow boundaries in 1938. Over three phases a total of 1,336 deck-access apartment blocks, in heights of between two seven stories and with inter-linking pedestrian access corridors, were built.Darnley Tenements (Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection, 2004), the Glasgow StoryGlasgow, Glen Clunie Drive, Darnley Development General View (1991), Canmore This fell short of the initial number planned owing to a combination of economic, political and management setbacks. It was intended that Darnley would be a largely self- supporting estate and for this reason, two primary schools and a community centre formed part of the Council's plans. A social club and bowling green, a church, a small shopping centre and a library were all added throughout the 1970s.Neighbourhoods: Darnley, The Glasgow Story The broadening of the A726 to dual carriageway status in 1983 heralded the development of the Nitshill corridor as a light industrial and retail location. Darnley Trading Estate and large retail outlets are clustered around junction 3 of the southward extension of the M77 motorway (completed in 1997). The closure of Darnley Hospital in 1992 and the opening on the site of a ¬£3 million 120-bed nursing home in 1993 has also altered the employment opportunities for the local population and has become symptomatic of the regeneration of modern Darnley. However, there is a huge retail area with large chain stores, including a Sainsbury's supermarket (the first in Scotland, dating from 1992).Analysis: How Oliver got an extra serving at Sainsbury's, The Scotsman, 30 May 2002 The Darnley plane tree plane tree\\" (actually acer pseudoplatanus, sycamore tree); it must therefore have been mature in the 1560s as Darnley died in 1567 Mary, Queen of Scots came to Glasgow early in 1567, having left Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on 24 January to collect her husband, Lord Darnley.

Description  Ladyfish Elops saurus, Fort Desoto County Park, Tampa Bay, November 2016 Like other species in its genus, the ladyfish has a long, slender, rounded body covered with silvery scales. Its mouth is terminal and the tail is deeply forked. The species can be distinguished by counting the number of gill rakers and vertebrae.McBride, Richard S., et al. 2010. A new species of ladyfish, of the genus Elops (Elopiformes: Elopidae), from the western Atlantic Ocean. Zootaxa. 2346: 29-41.  Distribution  The ladyfish is distributed in the western North Atlantic Ocean from New England to Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico. Its distribution overlaps with the malacho (Elops smithi) in the southeast US and the southern Gulf of Mexico.McBride, Richard S. and A. Z. Horodysky. 2004. Mechanisms maintaining sympatric distributions of two ladyfish (Elopidae: Elops) morphs in the Gulf of Mexico and western North Atlantic Ocean. Limnology and Oceanography. 49(4): 1173-1181.  Biology  Like other members of the Elopidae, the ladyfish is a pelagic fish that spawns in the sea, but little is known about this marine phase. The larvae, which are transparent and laterally compressed, are dispersed inshore and enter embayments, where they live for 2 to 3 yr.Gehringer, J. W. 1959. Early development and metamorphosis of the ten-pounder Elops saurus Linnaeus. Fishery Bulletin. 59: 618-647. The juveniles are euryhaline, or tolerant to a wide range of salinity, so these embayments may be low-salinity estuaries or hypersaline lagoons.McBride, Richard S., et al. 2001. Nursery habitats for ladyfish, Elops saurus, along salinity gradients in two Florida estuaries. Fishery Bulletin. 99(3): 443-458. Subadults move into the lower reaches of the embayments, and upon maturation, proceed to offshore, marine habitats.  Threats  This species uses estuarine areas and hypersaline lagoons; changes in the quality of these habitats may affect this species' population dynamics. Although this species may not be closely associated with any single habitat, it may be adversely affected by development and urbanization.Adams, A. J., et al. 2013.

Two-Way Mirror Punched Steel Hedge Labyrinth. Family in a box, Minneapolis photo by Wendy Seltzer Daniel Graham (born March 31, 1942) is an American artist, writer, and curator. Graham grew up in New Jersey. In 1964 he began directing the John Daniels Gallery in New York, where he put on Sol LeWitt's first one-man show, and in groups shows, exhibited works of Donald Judd, Dara Birnbaum, Dan Flavin and Robert Smithson. Like these artists, Graham considered himself a writer-artist, publishing essays and reviews on rock music, Dwight D. Eisenhower's paintings, and Dean Martin's television show. His earliest work dealt with the magazine page, predating but often associated with Conceptual art. His work often focuses on cultural phenomena, and incorporates photography, video, performance art, glass and mirror structures. He lives and works in New York.  Childhood and early career  Dan Graham was born in Urbana, Illinois, the son of a chemist and an educational psychologist. When he was 3, Graham moved from Illinois to Winfield Township, New Jersey, and then to nearby Westfield when he was 14. He had no formal education after high school and is self-educated. During his teens, reading included Margaret Mead, Claude L√©vi-Strauss, the literary critic Leslie Fiedler and the French Nouveau Roman writers. He wanted to be a writer, loved rock music which he wrote about critically and because he couldn't afford art supplies his early art took the form of magazine \\"articles\\".  Work  Graham began his art career in 1964, at the age of 22, when he founded the John Daniels Gallery in New York. He worked there until 1965, when he started creating his own conceptual pieces. During his time at the gallery, he exhibited works by minimalist artists such as Carl Andr√©, Sol LeWitt‚ÄîLeWitt's first solo gallery show, Donald Judd, Robert Smithson, Dan Flavin and Ward Jackson. In the past thirty years, Dan Graham has proved himself to be a wide-ranging artist. His work consists of performance art, installations, video, sculpture, and photography. Few of Graham's works have been commissioned or exhibited in the United States. In fact, the only major work commissioned in the U.S. in the last decade was the Rooftop Urban Park Project, in which he designed the piece Two-Way Mirror Cylinder Inside Cube and Video Salon (1981‚Äì1991). Some other commissions in the U.S. are Yin/Yang at MIT, the labyrinth at the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden, and at Middlebury College, and in Madison Square Park. Graham's work was always firmly based within conceptual art practice. Early examples were photographs and numerological sequences, often printed in magazines, for example Figurative (1965) and Schema (1966). With the latter Graham draws on the actual physical structure of the magazine in which it is printed for the content of the work itself. As such the same work changes according to its physical/structural location within the world. His early breakthrough-work however was a series of magazine-style photographs with text, Homes for America (1966‚Äì67), which counterpoints the monotonous and alienating effect of 1960's housing developments with their supposed desirability and the physical-geometry of a printed article.Dan Graham (October Files), Alex Kitnick, MIT Press, 2011. Ch.1. Other works include Side Effects/Common Drugs (1966) and Detumescence (1966). After this Graham broadened his conceptual practice development with performance, film, video and sculpture including Rock My Religion (1984) and Performer/Audience/Mirror (1975). His installations such as Public Space/Two Audiences (1976) or Yesterday/Today (1975) further inspired his move to the indoor and outdoor pavilions he most recently designs. His many conceptual pavilions including Two Way Mirror with Hedge Labyrinth (1989) and Two Way Mirror and Open Wood Screen Triangular Pavilion (1990) have increased his popularity as an artist. Dan Graham's first sculpture building project was Caf√© Bravo at Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin. After a lecture at the Berlin University of the Arts, Klaus Biesenbach invited Dan Graham to conceive the pavilion for Kunst-Werke, which Biesenbach founded, and he assisted Graham in the realization of the project. In addition to his visual works, he has published a large array of critical and speculative writing. = Influences = In Sarah Lehrer-Graiwer's publication Pep Talk in 2009, Graham gave \\"Artists' and Architects' Work That Influenced Me\\" (in alphabetical order): Michael Asher, Larry Bell, Flavin, Itsuko Hasegawa, LeWitt, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Mangold, Bruce Nauman, Claes Oldenburg, Kazuo Shinohara, Michael Snow, Mies van der Rohe and Robert Venturi. Writer Brian Wallis has said that Graham's works ‚Äúdisplayed a profound faith in the idea of the present, [he] sought to comprehend post-war American culture through imaginative new forms of analytical investigation, facto-graphic reportage, and quasi-scientific mappings of space/time relationships.‚Äù Graham's work has been influenced by the social change of the Civil Rights Movement, The Vietnam War, the Women's liberation movement as well as many other cultural changes. These prolific events and changes in history affected the conceptual art and minimalist movements. Like LeWitt, Morris, Smithson and Flavin, Graham has worked at the intersection of minimalism and conceptual art. Graham exhibited a predominantly minimalist aesthetic in his earlier photographs and prints. His prints of numeric sequences, words, graphs, and graphics strongly reflect his minimalist qualities. His later works have become very conceptual, and examine the relationships between interior space, exterior space, and the perception of the viewer when anticipated boundaries are changed. = Photography = Soon after he left the John Daniels Gallery, Dan Graham started a series of photographs which started in the sixties and continues into the present. Of his magazine work, Graham said, These photographs question the relationship between public and private architecture and the ways in which each space affects behavior. Some of his first conceptual works dealt with different forms of printed artwork of numeric sequences. In 1965 Graham began shooting color photographs for his series Homes For America. All the photographs taken were of single-family homes around the American suburbs. This photo series, one of the first artworks in the space of text, was published as a twopage spread in Arts Magazine. The \\"article\\" is an assembly of texts including his photographs. The photographs were also chosen for the exhibition \\"Projected Art\\" at the Finch College Museum of Art. In 1969, Graham focused on performance and film that explored the social dynamic of the audience, incorporating them into the work, leading to an 80 ft photo series, Sunset to Sunrise.Dan Graham Tate Collection. =Performance, film and video= From the late 1960s into the late 70's, Graham shifted toward a largely performance-based practice, incorporating film and the new medium of video in his systematic investigations of cybernetics, phenomenology and embodiment. In 1969, he made his first film Sunset to Sunrise, in which the camera moves opposite to the course of sun, inverting the progression of time. This piece is emblematic of his filmic work that would extend into the early 1970s, in which he would explore ‚Äúsubjective, time-based processes‚Äù through perceptual, kinetic exercises, using the camera as an extension of his body and implicating the subjectivity of the viewer. Other films from this period include Two Correlated Rotations (1969), Roll (1970), and Body Press (1970‚Äì72), all three featuring the interaction of two cameras or the juxtaposition of two films. Roll (1970) was a performance exercise in phenomenology similar to Bruce Nauman's early films.Marian Goodman Gallery, press release statement for \\"Dan Graham Films: 1969-1974\\" (January 8, 2002), . Body Press, in which a naked man and woman stand back-to-back in a cylinder lined with concave mirrors filming themselves and their distorted reflections, introduces the mirrored image as a prominent theme for Graham, which he would explore extensively in his performance and video practice as well as his later architectural work. Graham has stated that his works are ‚Äúmodels to define the limits of an idea of representation as the conventional limits which necessarily define the situation between the artist and spectator,‚Äù and his performances in the 1970s foreground this relational approach. In these works Graham explicitly invokes theories of structural linguistics, especially the work of Jacques Lacan.Dan Graham, \\"Performance/Audience/Mirror\\" (1975), in Two-Way Mirror Power: Selected Writings by Dan Graham on His Art. Graham's 1972 performance piece Two Consciousness Projections underscores a preoccupation with phenomenological aspects of relationality, utilizing the reflective capacities of video feedback. In the performance, a woman sits in front of a monitor displaying her image from the live feed of a video camera held by a man behind the monitor and attempts to narrate her conscious mind, while the man describes her as he watches through the camera. This work presents an experiment in self-perception and representation, modulated by numerous mirroring agents‚Äîthe woman's own image on the monitor, the ‚Äúimage‚Äù of her depicted by the man, as well as both performers‚Äô awareness of the audience. In his own writings, Graham articulates an interest in deconstructing the divisions between interior intention and visible behavior formed when looking at one's reflection in a mirror, proposing video feedback as both a technical and conceptual means by which to achieve this. Many of Graham's performance pieces work to exhibit and exploit the spontaneous interaction between thought and expression, inside and outside, extending this dissolution of barriers to dichotomies of performer and audience, private and public. Graham's most complex interrogation of this is the performance Performer/Audience/Mirror (1977), in which he stands between a large mirror and an audience, describing himself, the audience, his reflection, and the audience's reflection in sequential phases of continuous commentary. Expanding upon the themes in Two Consciousness Projections, this work implicates the audience in their own feedback cycle of self-perception. Graham produced a number of videos that documented his performance works, such as the 1972 Past Future Split Attention, in which the conversation of two acquaintances becomes a cacophony of simultaneous speech and interruption.Martha Schendener (November 30, 2012), When Counterculture of 1971 Got Its Hands on Video The New York Times. One other major example of a documented performance is Performance/Audience/Mirror (1975). Graham also incorporated video into installations, creating environments where video technology is used to alter the viewer's own bodily experience. In 1974, he created an installation with a series of videos called \\"Time Delay Room\\", which used time-delayed Closed- circuit television cameras and video projections. Lastly, Graham produced a number of video documentaries, such as Rock My Religion from (1983‚Äì84) and Minor Threat (1983). Rock My Religion (1984) explores rock music as an art form and draws a parallel between it and the development of the Shaker religion in America. He observes the changes in beliefs and superstitions in the Shaker religion since the 18th century, and relates them to the development of rock culture. The film has been distributed widely, and has included screenings at both institutional and counter-cultural venues across Europe and the US, including Lisson Gallery, Auto Italia South East, Whitney Museum of American Art and Ch√¢teau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art.Auto Italia. \\"http://autoitaliasoutheast.org/blog/news/project/dan- grahams-rock-my-religion/\\". Retrieved 27-08-2015. Minor Threat documents the youth culture surrounding the band of the same name. In it, Graham analyses the social implications of this subculture, treating it \\"as a tribal rite, a catalyst for the violence and frustration of its predominantly male, teenage audience.\\"Minor Threat (1983). = Pavilions = Pavilion in Berlin, Germany Dan Graham's artworks are said to blur the line between sculpture and architecture. Since the 1980s, Graham has been working on an ongoing series of freestanding, sculptural objects called pavilions. Graham's popularity has grown since he started his walk-in pavilions and he has received commissions all over the world. His pavilions are steel and glass sculptures which create a different space which disorients the viewer from his or her usual surroundings or knowledge of space. They are made of a few huge panes of glass or mirror, or of half-mirrored glass that is both reflective and transparent.Blake Gopnik (September 3, 2009), Blake Gopnik on the Dan Graham Retrospective at N.Y.'s Whitney The Washington Post Wooden lattice and steel are other materials most commonly used in his work. The MIT Art Center calls his pavilions rigorously conceptual, uniquely beautiful, and insistently public. The pavilions create a unique experience for the viewer. His pavilions are created for the public experience. His pavilions combine architecture and art. Dan Graham's pavilion works have been compared to Ryue Nishizawa and Kazuyo Sjima‚Äôs work on the Kanazawa Museum. The glass wall of the structure reflects and distorts light much like Grahams sculptures. The layered, but simplistic quality is said to be very much like Graham's. The structures are similar in their study of space and light. In 1981, Graham started work on a decade long project in New York City. The work Two-Way Mirror Cylinder Inside Cube and Video Salon was part of the Rooftop Urban Park Project. Graham worked on the piece in collaboration with architects Mojdeh Baratloo and Clifton Balch. This transparent and reflective pavilion transformed the roof of 548 West 22nd Street into a rooftop park. The pavilion captures the surrounding landscape and changes of light creating an intense visual effect with the sky. The Two-Way Mirror Cylinder Inside Cube and Video Salon has become one of his most well-known works throughout his art career. After numerous commissions in Europe, the Children's Pavilion (1988‚Äì93) was actually the first piece Graham was commissioned to do in the United States. A collaboration with Jeff Wall, the pavilion is a very conceptual piece relating to the children of the nation. It is a circular shaped room with an oculus that is both transparent and reflective at the top, so the viewers on the outside of the building could look inside as well. Wall's nine circular framed photographs of children belonging to many nationalities and ethnic backgrounds surround the room. Each child is shown half-length and viewed from below against the background of a sky. In each image Wall chooses a different sky. In 1991, the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art attempted to realise the pavilion on Rotterdam's Ommoord district; the plan was eventually abandoned in 1994.Jeff Wall on long- term loan to the Boijmans Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam. Related works include Children's Pavilion (Chambre d'Amis) (1986), Skateboard Pavilion (1989), and Funhouse for the Children of Saint-Janslein (1997‚Äì99).Dan Graham: Children's Day Care, CD-Rom, Cartoon and Computer Screen Library Project & other works for water, backyards, and children, April 5 - May 20, 2000 Marian Goodman Gallery, New York.

In 1991, an exhibition of his pavilions and photographs was held at the Lisson Gallery in London. Another important exhibition featuring Graham was \\"Public/Private\\", an exhibition that traveled to four different venues. The show, which included his pavilions, architectural photographs and models, performances, and video installations, had its opening in 1994 at the Moore College of Art and Design. In 2001, a retrospective was held covering his 35-year career. The museums holding the event included the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville in Paris, Kroller-Muller Museum in Otterlo, the Netherlands, and Kiasma Museum in Helsinki, Finland. In 2009, another major retrospective was mounted in the U.S., showing at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis. Graham's work has also been exhibited at the Venice Biennale (1976, 2003, 2004 and 2005), documentas V, VI, VII, IX and X (1972, 1977, 1982, 1992 and 1997), and at Skulptur Projekte M√ºnster '87 and '97. = Selected solo exhibitions = *2015, Dan Graham Observatory/Playground, MAMO, Centre d'art de la Cit√© Radieuse, Marseille, France *2011, Dan Graham: Exposition d'overture, Le Consortium, France *2011, Dan Graham: Models and Videos, Eastside Projects, Birmingham *2010, Les Rencontres d'Arles festival, France. *2009, Dan Graham: Beyond, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (Retrospective) *2009, Dan Graham: Beyond, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (Retrospective) *2009, Dan Graham: Beyond, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (Retrospective) *2001, Dan Graham ≈íuvres, 1965‚Äì2000, Mus√©e d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris, Paris *2001, Dan Graham Works, 1965‚Äì2000, Museu de Arte Contempor√¢nea de Serralves, Porto *2000, Dan Graham: Children's Day Care Center, CD-Rom, Cartoon, and Computer Screen Library Project, Marian Goodman Gallery, New York *1999, Dan Graham, Architekturmodell, Kunst-Werke Berlin, Berlin *1997, Dan Graham, The Suburban City, Neue Galerie am Landesmuseum Joanneum, Graz *1995, Dan Graham, Video/Architecture/Performance, EA-Generali-Foundation, Vienna *1994, Dan Graham: Public/Private, Moore College of Art and Design, Philadelphia; List Visual Arts Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Toronto, LACE - Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, Los Angeles *1991, Pavilion Sculptures & Photographs, Lisson Gallery, London *1986, Storefront for Art and Architecture, New York *1981, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center / Institute for Art and Urban Resources, Long Island City, New York *1977, Stedelijk Van Abbe Museum, Eindhoven References Bibliography *Alberro, Alexander and Graham, Dan Dan Graham - Models to Projects (Marian Goodman Gallery 1998) *Alberro, Alexander, Dan Graham, and Friedrich W.

The ratio was proposed by Marcial Losada and psychologist Barbara Fredrickson, who identified a ratio of positive to negative affect of exactly 2.9013 as separating flourishing from languishing individuals in a 2005 paper in American Psychologist. The concept of a critical positivity ratio was widely embraced by both academic psychologists and the lay public; Fredrickson and Losada's paper was cited nearly 1,000 times, and Fredrickson wrote a popular book expounding the concept of \\"the 3-to-1 ratio that will change your life\\". Fredrickson wrote: \\"Just as zero degrees Celsius is a special number in thermodynamics, the 3-to-1 positivity ratio may well be a magic number in human psychology.\\" The first critical evaluation of the mathematical modeling behind the critical positivity ratio was published by a group of Finnish researchers Luoma, H√§m√§l√§inen and Saarinen in 2008. The authors noted that \\"Only very limited explanations are given about the modeling process and the meaning and interpretation of its parameters. Thus, the reasoning behind the model equations remains unclear to the reader.\\" Moreover, \\"the model also produces strange and previously unreported behavior under certain conditions. Thus, the predictive validity of the model also becomes problematic.\\" Later in 2013, the critical positivity ratio aroused the skepticism of Nick Brown, a graduate student in applied positive psychology, who felt that the paper's mathematical claims underlying the critical positivity ratio were fundamentally flawed. Brown collaborated with physicist Alan Sokal and psychologist Harris Friedman on a re-analysis of the paper's data. They argued that Fredrickson and Losada's paper contained \\"numerous fundamental conceptual and mathematical errors\\", as did Losada's earlier work on positive psychology, which completely invalidated their claims. In their response, H√§m√§l√§inen and colleagues argued that there were no fundamental errors in the mathematics itself, but the problems relate to the interpretation and justification of the use of the model. Losada declined to respond to the criticism, indicating that he was too busy running his consulting business. Fredrickson wrote a response in which she conceded that the mathematical aspects of the critical positivity ratio were \\"questionable\\" and that she had \\"neither the expertise nor the insight\\" to defend them, but she maintained that the empirical evidence was solid. Brown and colleagues, whose response was published the next year, maintain that there is no evidence for the critical positivity ratio. In response, American Psychologist formally retracted the mathematical modeling elements of Fredrickson & Losada's paper, including the specific critical positivity ratio of 2.9013, as invalid. The fact that the problems with the paper went unnoticed for years despite the widespread publicity surrounding the critical positivity ratio contributed to a perception that social psychology as a field lacked scientific soundness and rigorous critical thinking. Sokal later stated: \\"The main claim made by Fredrickson and Losada is so implausible on its face that some red flags ought to have been raised.\\" Concept Building on research by Barbara Fredrickson indicating that individuals with a higher ratio of positive to negative emotions tend to have more successful life outcomes,Fredrickson, B. L. (2004). The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences, 359, 1367-1377. and on studies by Marcial Losada applying differential equations from fluid dynamics to human emotions, Fredrickson and Losada used nonlinear dynamics modelling (based on Lorenz systems) to argue that the ideal positivity/negativity ratio lies between 2.9013 and 11.6346. They argued that those with ratios within this range will \\"flourish\\", whereas those with values outside it will \\"languish\\". They claimed that their model predicted cut-off points for the maximum and minimum positivity ratios within which one should observe qualitative changes in an individual's level of flourishing. Criticism Losada's article was critiqued by Andr√©s Navas in a Note to the French website of the CNRS \\"Images des Math√©matiques\\".Navas, A. (2011). Un cas d'inconscience (?). Images des Math√©matiques. ) The whole theory of the critical positivity ratio was strongly critiqued by Nicholas Brown, Alan Sokal, and Harris Friedman, in a 2013 article published in American Psychologist. Brown et al. argue that Losada's conclusions in previous papers using modelling from fluid dynamics, and those in his paper co-authored with Fredrickson, are not only based on poorly reported experiments ‚Äì they argue that it is difficult to draw any conclusions from some previous studies by Losada because critical details are omitted, and \\"interpretations of results are made with little or no justification\\" (p. 5) ‚Äì but are based on elementary errors in the use of differential equations. Among the severe flaws claimed by Brown et al. in the positivity-ratio theory and its presentation were: * That the data used by Losada in several analyses do not meet the basic criteria for the use of differential equations (such as the use of continuous variables that evolve smoothly and deterministically over time). * That the differential equations used by Losada to calculate the critical positivity ratio use parameters taken directly from Lorenz's simplified, illustrative, and most importantly, arbitrary models for fluid dynamics. Losada gives no rationale for his choice of parameters. Using different arbitrary parameters gives different positivity ratios, and thus the precise values for the ratio given by Fredrickson and Losada (2.9013 to 11.6346) are meaningless. * That the butterfly-like Figure 1 provided by Fredrickson and Losada is not a model of the data taken from their human participants, but \\"the results of computer simulations of the Lorenz equations, nothing more\\" (p. 11). * That even if one takes the idea of the precise positivity/negativity ratio numbers seriously, there should exist not just a single ratio band in which \\"flourishing\\" should occur, but several \\"windows\\" of desirable and undesirable positivity/negativity ratios above a certain value. That is, it is likely that Fredrickson and Losada did not fully grasp the implications of applying nonlinear dynamics to their data. Brown et al. state that one can: > only marvel at the astonishing coincidence that human emotions should turn > out to be governed by exactly the same set of equations that were derived in > a celebrated article several decades ago as a deliberately simplified model > of convection in fluids, and whose solutions happen to have visually > appealing properties. An alternative explanation ‚Äì and, frankly, the one > that appears most plausible to us ‚Äì is that the entire process of > \\"derivation\\" of the Lorenz equations has been contrived to demonstrate an > imagined fit between some rather limited empirical data and the > scientifically impressive world of nonlinear dynamics. (p. 8) They \\"urge future researchers to exercise caution in the use of advanced mathematical tools, such as nonlinear dynamics\\" (p. 1). Fredrickson responded to the critique by agreeing that Losada's mathematical modelling is \\"questionable\\" and does not show that there are precise values of the ratio, but also arguing that the evidence for the benefits of a high positivity/negativity ratio is solid. Fredrickson noted that Losada declined to respond to the criticism. Sokal was openly critical about this partial retraction, and in 2014, American Psychologist published their response to Fredrikson's retraction, where they emphatically argue that there is no evidence for the critical positivity ratio whatsoever. Responding to comments on their original critique, they conclude the entire affair by lamenting that instead of replacing the \\"unbridled romanticism\\" of humanist psychology with a rigorous evidence-based psychology, as Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi promised in their founding manifesto of positive psychology, the widespread acceptance of the critical positivity ratio shows, in their view, that positive psychology has betrayed this promise: \\"That the sin is now romantic scientism rather than pure romanticism is not, in our view, a great advance.\\"  Other data  Studies in different domains provide empirical evidence of ratios ranging from 3-to-1 to 5.8-to-1.

It stars Ray Liotta, Lance Henriksen, Stuart Wilson, Kevin Dillon, Michael Lerner and Ernie Hudson. It was based on the 1987 novel The Penal Colony by Richard Herley. In a dystopian future, a former Marine serves life imprisonment on an island inhabited by savage and cannibalistic prisoners. It is the first film collaboration between Wilson and Campbell, the second film being, The Mask of Zorro, released in 1998, and the third film, Vertical Limit, released in 2000.  Plot  In 2022, the penal system is run by corporations, and prisoners are seen as assets. Highly-trained ex-Marine John Robbins is imprisoned for life for murdering his commanding officer after being ordered to kill innocent civilians in Benghazi; having escaped from two Level 5 maximum security prisons, he is sent to a Level 6 facility. A fellow prisoner tells him about \\"Absolom\\", an island where they send the worst prisoners and is feared more than the prison. The Warden, after being held at gunpoint by Robbins, is convinced that he is a threat and exiles him to the island. On the island, Robbins is captured by a group of prisoners known as the Outsiders, led by a sociopath named Walter Marek and whose only rule is The Law of the Jungle. The abandoned island resort, complete with dilapidated houses and a swimming pool, is where the Outsiders have established a base. Marek forces Robbins to fight one of his men for amusement and is impressed when Robbins kills his opponent in seconds. He offers him a position in his gang; instead, Robbins knocks Marek into the pool, steals his rocket launcher, and flees the Outsider's camp. He is pursued through the jungle and cornered at the edge of a high cliff before being shot in the neck by blowgun darts. After falling into the river below, another prisoner group called the Insiders retrieves him. Led by a terminally-ill doctor called the Father, the Insiders established a cooperative autonomous community with laws as opposed to the tyranny of the Outsiders. Robbins meets Father; King, the new-arrival helper; and befriends Casey, a naive young man given a life sentence for kidnapping. Robbins learns that the Insiders are heavily outnumbered by the Outsiders and that he is the only person to have ever escaped from Marek's camp. The weapon he stole is appropriated for the good of the community. After helping repel an attack by the Outsiders, Father notes Robbins' abilities and asks him to join them. He refuses, saying he wants to leave Absolom; Father takes Robbins to the shore, explaining that they are 200 miles from the mainland. Gunships patrol 50 miles off the coast, and infrared satellite technology monitors thermal activity, such as large fires or explosions. The Insiders have secretly built a scan- proof boat and launch it to tell the outside world about Absolom. However, the boat is destroyed by attack helicopters, causing Father to believe there is an informer among them. Robbins learns about a new boat and demands a seat, still determined to escape. After learning that the engine needs a distributor, a part Robbins saw while in Marek's camp, he offers to retrieve it in exchange for passage; the Insiders agree. Casey follows Robbins, who infiltrates the Outsiders' camp and gets the engine part, but they are captured by the Outsiders. Robbins is forced to fight Casey to the death. Knowing they won't both escape, Casey impales himself on Robbins' weapon. Robbins escapes a planned execution with the help of an Insider spy, infuriating Marek. Knowing Marek will attack, and over stern objection, Robbins convinces the Insiders to abandon their camp, but not before lacing it with booby traps. He stays behind to fire the stolen rocket launcher, igniting an incendiary bomb. Most of the Outsiders die, and the Warden intervenes when the satellites are triggered. Father dies while defending Robbins from Marek. After Robbins kills Marek, he finds the new boat incinerated and evidence that King has killed the engineer. Robbins forces King to give new coordinates to the Warden for where to land his helicopter on the island. Robbins hijacks the helicopter, throws the Warden out, and vows to spread the truth. King and the Warden are left behind as unseen Outsiders close in on them.

B. Wilson and Company of Leeds, named after Jenny Lind, who was a famous opera singer of the period. The general design proved to be so successful that the manufacturers adopted it for use on other railways, and it became the first mass-produced locomotive type. The \\"Jenny Lind\\" type was also widely copied during the late 1840s and 1850s, and into the 1860s. History David Joy, the Chief Draughtsman of E. B. Wilson and Company, was asked to visit Brighton railway works to make tracings of the drawings of a 2-2-2 locomotive designed by John Gray for the railway so that ten further examples could be built. However, before he had completed the task, Gray had been dismissed from his post of Locomotive Superintendent, and his successor Thomas Kirtley did not favour Gray's complicated horse-leg motion. As a result it was left to Joy and James Fenton, the works manager at E.B. Wilson, to adapt the design. p.38-9. Joy had spent his formative years studying all the locomotives he came across, sketching them, making notes, and interrogating their owners and crews ‚Äî and, if he could, getting rides on them. * Sekon, G.A., (1908) Some Links in the Evolution of the Locomotive: the particulars extracted from the Diaries of the Late David Joy; Railway Magazine Volumes 22 & 23\\\\. Archived on \\"Steam Index\\" website As is usual in engineering, there were a number of trade-offs to be made in steam locomotive design. There is a limit to the rate that steam can be delivered to the pistons; therefore, higher speed was obtained with larger driving wheels. These, however, limited the size of the boiler, since it needed to fit between them, particularly with the preoccupation of the time with a lower centre of gravity. The tendency had been to lengthen the boilers with supporting wheels front and rear. Thus, passenger engines, like the so- called Long Boiler locomotives, were usually of a 4-2-0 wheel arrangement.Lowe.J.W. (1975) British Steam Locomotive Builders. London: Guild Publishing However, too long a boiler also created instability. Some locomotives improved adhesion for heavier loads by coupling pairs of driving wheels, but there was a tendency for the wrought iron coupling rods to break especially at speed. Thus, four- and six-coupled locomotives were used for freight trains. Joy and Fenton settled on a medium-sized boiler, heated surface area, with a pressure of and concentrated on its steaming abilities. In this, James Fenton had particular expertise. The engine had inside cylinders and driving wheels. Gray's so-called \\"mixed\\" frame had an inside frame for the cylinders and driving wheels, with inside bearings, and an outside frame for the leading and trailing wheels, using outside bearings. The inside frame stopped at the firebox, so that the latter was as wide as the wheels would allow. By this means he minimized the overhang at each end. After strengthening of various members, the engine was three tons heavier than expected. However, it steamed freely and was economical on fuel. It was to this that its success was attributed, along with the increase in boiler pressure that had become possible over the years. However, credit must be given to Joy's suspension arrangements that made it extremely smooth-running and stable. The name \\"Jenny Lind\\" was given to the first one delivered to the London Brighton and South Coast Railway. =Jenny Lind type= The new class proved to be so successful that the design was used by Wilson & Co. as their standard design and more than seventy examples were built for various railways, including twenty-four for the Midland Railway. It could be said to be the first to be mass-produced to a consistent pattern. Indeed, the manufacturers charged a hefty premium for variations, although in response to pressure, they later built a number of \\"large jennies\\". Other manufacturers and railways also adopted the type. John Chester Craven, Kirtley's successor at Brighton, built a class of five similar \\"Jenny Lind singles\\" from 1853 to 1854. p.52. An enlarged type was also built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1860 for the Portuguese South Western Railway.Hamilton Ellis, The pictorial history of railways, Hamlyn, 1968, p.58.

The bill implemented major changes to U.S. social welfare policy, replacing the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The law was a cornerstone of the Republican Party's \\"Contract with America,\\" and also fulfilled Clinton's campaign promise to \\"end welfare as we know it.\\" AFDC had come under increasing criticism in the 1980s, especially from conservatives who argued that welfare recipients were \\"trapped in a cycle of poverty.\\" After the 1994 elections, the Republican-controlled Congress passed two major bills designed to reform welfare, but they were vetoed by Clinton. After negotiations between Clinton and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Congress passed PRWORA and Clinton signed the bill into law on August 22, 1996. PRWORA granted states greater latitude in administering social welfare programs, and implemented new requirements on welfare recipients, including a five-year lifetime limit on benefits. After the passage of the law, the number of individuals receiving federal welfare dramatically declined. The law was heralded as a \\"reassertion of America's work ethic\\" by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, largely in response to the bill's workfare component. History =1930s to 1970s= AFDC caseloads increased dramatically from the 1930s to the 1960s as restrictions on the availability of cash support to poor families (especially single-parent, female-headed households) were reduced. Under the Social Security Act of 1935, federal funds only covered part of relief costs, providing an incentive for localities to make welfare difficult to obtain. More permissive laws were tested during the Great Migration between 1940 and 1970 in which millions of black people migrated from the agricultural South to the more industrial northern and western regions of the United States to find jobs in wartime defense industry and in the post-war era. Additionally, all able-bodied adults without children and two-parent families were originally disqualified from obtaining AFDC funds. Court rulings during the Civil Rights Movement struck down many of these regulations, creating new categories of people eligible for relief. Community organizations, such as the National Welfare Rights Organization, also distributed informational packets informing citizens of their ability to receive government assistance. Between 1936 and 1969, the number of families receiving support increased from 162,000 to 1,875,000. After 1970, however, federal funding for the program lagged behind inflation. Between 1970 and 1994, typical benefits for a family of three fell 47% after adjusting for inflation. = Reasons for policy reversal =  Attitudes towards women's roles  The legislation was designed to increase labor market participation among public assistance recipients. This represented a major departure from the protectionist legacy institutionalized in U.S. social welfare policy from the inception of \\"mother's pensions\\" beginning in the early 19th century. As such, the implicit message regarding \\"women's roles\\" was that full-time mothering was a luxury reserved only for people who could afford it.  Concern about dependency  The idea that the welfare-receiving poor had become too dependent upon public assistance also encouraged the act. The idea was that those who were on welfare for many years lost any initiative to find jobs. Those on welfare realized that taking up a job would mean not only losing benefits but also incur child care, transportation and clothing costs. Their new jobs probably would not pay well or include health insurance, whereas on welfare they would have been covered by Medicaid. Therefore, there are many reasons welfare recipients would be discouraged from working. =1980s and 1990s= In the 1980s, AFDC came under increasing bipartisan criticism for the program's alleged ineffectiveness. While acknowledging the need for a social safety net, Democrats often invoked the culture of poverty argument. Proponents of the bill argued that welfare recipients were \\"trapped in a cycle of poverty\\". Highlighting instances of welfare fraud, conservatives often referred to the system as a \\"welfare trap\\" and pledged to \\"dismantle the welfare state\\". Ronald Reagan's oft-repeated story of a welfare queen from Chicago's South Side became part of a larger discourse on welfare reform. Republican governor Tommy Thompson began instituting welfare reform in Wisconsin during his governorship in the late-1980s and early-1990s. In lobbying the federal government to grant states wider latitude for implementing welfare, Thompson wanted a system where \\"pregnant teen-aged girls from Milwaukee, no matter what their background is or where they live, can pursue careers and chase their dreams.\\" His solution was workfare, whereby poor individuals, typically single mothers, had to be employed in order to receive assistance. Thompson later served as Health and Human Services Secretary under President George W. Bush. Passage of PRWORA was the culmination of many years of debate in which the merits and flaws of AFDC were argued. Research was used by both sides to make their points, with each side often using the same piece of research to support the opposite view. The political atmosphere at the time of PRWORA's passage included a Republican- controlled House of Representatives and Senate (defined by their Contract with America) and a Democratic president (defined by Bill Clinton's promise to \\"end welfare as we know it\\"). =2012= In July 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services released a memo notifying states that they were able to apply for a waiver for the work requirements of the TANF program, but only if they could find other credible ways to increase employment by 20%. The waiver would allow states to provide assistance without having to enforce the work component of the program, which currently states that 50 percent of a state's TANF caseload must meet work requirements. The Obama administration stated that the change was made in order to allow more flexibility in how individual states operate their welfare programs. According to Peter Edelman, the director of the Georgetown Center on Poverty, Inequality and Public Policy, the waivers would reduce the difficulty for states in helping TANF applicants find jobs. The change has been questioned by Republicans including Dave Camp, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and Orrin Hatch, who requested further details from HHS over concerns that the memo would remove the main focus of PRWORA. Mitt Romney attacked the measure, saying that Obama was \\"gutting welfare reform\\". However, PolitiFact stated that Romney's claim was \\"not accurate\\" and \\"inflames old resentments\\", giving it a \\"Pants on Fire\\" rating. CNN also reported that assertions that Obama was \\"taking the work requirement off the table\\" was false. In response to Republican criticism, Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services said that states, including some with Republican governors, had previously asked Congress to allow waivers. Passage in 104th Congress President Bill Clinton signing welfare reform legislation A central pledge of Clinton's campaign was to reform the welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with universal health care, and no details or a plan had emerged on welfare reform. Newt Gingrich accused the President of stalling on welfare and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill in as little as 90 days. Gingrich promised that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve welfare legislation. In 1996, after constructing two welfare reform bills that were vetoed by President Clinton, Gingrich and his supporters pushed for the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), a bill aimed at substantially reconstructing the welfare system. Authored by Rep. John Kasich, the act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It started the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamps eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and recipient work requirements. Gingrich and Clinton negotiated the legislation in private meetings. Previously, Clinton had quietly spoken with Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott for months about the bill, but a compromise on a more acceptable bill for the President could not be reached. Gingrich, on the other hand, gave accurate information about his party's vote counts and persuaded the more conservative members of the Republican Party to vote in favor of PRWORA. President Clinton found the legislation more conservative than he would have preferred; however, having vetoed two earlier welfare proposals from the Republican-majority Congress, it was considered a political risk to veto a third bill during a campaign season with welfare reform as a central theme. As he signed the bill on August 22, 1996, Clinton stated that the act \\"gives us a chance we haven't had before to break the cycle of dependency that has existed for millions and millions of our fellow citizens, exiling them from the world of work. It gives structure, meaning and dignity to most of our lives\\". After the passage of the bill, Gingrich continued to press for welfare reform and increasing employment opportunities for welfare recipients. In his 1998 book Lessons Learned the Hard Way, Gingrich outlined a multi-step plan to improve economic opportunities for the poor. The plan called for encouraging volunteerism and spiritual renewal, placing more importance on families, creating tax incentives and reducing regulations for businesses in poor neighborhoods, and increasing property ownership for low-income families. Gingrich cited his volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity as an example of where he observed that it was more rewarding for people to be actively involved in improving their lives‚Äîby building their own homes‚Äîthan by receiving welfare payments from the government. Provisions Overall decline in welfare monthly benefits (in 2006 dollars)2008 Indicators of Welfare Dependence Figure TANF 2. PRWORA established TANF as AFDC's replacement. The Congressional findings in PRWORA highlighted dependency, out-of-wedlock birth, and intergenerational poverty as the main contributors to a faulty system. In instituting a block grant program, PRWORA granted states the ability to design their own systems, as long as states met a set of basic federal requirements. The bill's primary requirements and effects included the following: * Ending welfare as an entitlement program; * Requiring recipients to begin working after two years of receiving benefits; * Placing a lifetime limit of five years on benefits paid by federal funds; * Aiming to encourage two-parent families and discouraging out-of-wedlock births; * Enhancing enforcement of child support; and * Requiring state professional and occupational licenses to be withheld from undocumented immigrants. Having been granted wider latitude for designing their own programs, some states have decided to place additional requirements on recipients. Although the law placed a time limit for benefits supported by federal funds of no more than two consecutive years and no more than a collective total of five years over a lifetime, some states have enacted briefer limits. All states, however, allowed exceptions to avoid punishing children because their parents have gone over their respective time limits. Federal requirements have ensured some measure of uniformity across states, but the block grant approach has led individual states to distribute federal money in different ways. Certain states more actively encourage education; others use the money to fund private enterprises helping job seekers. The legislation also greatly limited funds available for unmarried parents under 18 and restricted any funding to all immigrants. Some state programs emphasized a shift towards work with names such as \\"Wisconsin Works\\" and \\"WorkFirst.\\" Between 1997 and 2000, enormous numbers of the poor have left or been terminated from the program, with a national drop of 53% in total recipients. According to the House Ways and Means Committee, \\"The major goal of Public Law 104‚Äì193 [PRWORA] is to reduce the length of welfare spells by attacking dependency while simultaneously preserving the function of welfare as a safety net for families experiencing temporary financial problems\\". A major prong in this effort was to improve child support collection rates in an effort to move single parent families off of the welfare rolls, and keep them off. According to the conference report, \\"It is the sense of the Senate that ‚Äî (a) States should diligently continue their efforts to enforce child support payments by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent, regardless of the employment status or location of the non-custodial parent\\". The reformed child support program attacks this problem by pursuing five major goals: automating many child support enforcement procedures; establishing uniform tracking procedures; strengthening interstate child support enforcement; requiring States to adopt stronger measures to establish paternity; and creating new and stronger enforcement tools to increase actual child support collections. The law envisions a child support system in which all States have similar child support laws, all States share information through the Federal child support office, mass processing of information is routine, and interstate cases are handled expeditiously. Section III (Child Support), Subtitle G (Enforcement of Child Support) contains 14 enforcement measures to improve the collection of child support, including potential denial or revocation of passports. One provision required the State Department to refuse or revoke passports for anyone who owed more than $5,000 in child support. Those provisions were upheld in Weinstein v. Albright (2001), Eunique v. Powell (2002), In re James K. Walker (2002), Dept of Revenue v. Nesbitt (2008), Risenhoover v. Washington (2008), Borracchini v. Jones (2009), and Dewald v. United States (E.D. MI 2009). = Ban on food stamps for drug felons = One component of the PRWORA was a lifetime ban on the use of food stamps through TANF for people convicted of drug felonies. It disallowed those with federal or state felony drug convictions from receiving benefits from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and TANF for life. Although it applied to all 50 states by default, states were also given the option to opt out of the ban. As of May 2019, only two states (South Carolina and West Virginia) have a lifetime ban for drug felons. The change is part of criminal justice reforms lawmakers have passed in aiming to prevent recidivism or the tendency for convicted criminals to reoffend. = Immigrant welfare = Another provision of PRWORA made some immigrants entering the United States ineligible for federal public benefits during the first five years after securing ‚Äúqualified‚Äù immigrant status. Qualified immigrants include: * Lawful permanent residents (people with green cards) * Refugees (1 year for refugee status) * Immigrants granted asylum or those with conditional entrants * Immigrants granted parole by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for at least one year * Immigrants whose deportations are being withheld * Cuban/Haitian entrants * Battered immigrant spouses, battered immigrant children, immigrant parents of battered children, and immigrant children of battered parents * Survivors of a severe form of trafficking All other immigrants, including illegal immigrants, temporary residents, and those who are lawfully present in the U.S., are considered ‚Äúnot qualified‚Äù. With a few exceptions, PRWORA excluded people in both categories from eligibility for many benefits: TANF, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, and State Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (CHIP). PRWORA enforced new citizenship requirements for federal public benefits. The involvement of immigrants in public benefits programs greatly decreased after the enactment of 1996 welfare reform laws. In light of the restrictions to federal funding under the law, states were allowed to grant aid out of their own funds to address the welfare needs of immigrants.  Benefit programs  Two of the key policies under PRWORA are the inclusion of immigrants in TANF and Medicaid. In 2009, 22 states had extended TANF benefits and Medicaid to immigrants. Five states (California, Hawaii, Minnesota, New York, and Washington) provide assistance to some nonqualified immigrants. Oftentimes, these policies have had discriminatory effects towards minorities. For instance, race has a strong negative correlation for TANF assistance granted to immigrants, as states with large African American populations were more likely to correspond with excluding lawful permanent residents from the program. In addition, states with large immigrant populations were more likely to correspond with people participating in Medicaid, as the program was designed to incentivize high-poverty states to include more people. In fact, high-poverty states acquire higher federal funding rates for each individual they cover through Medicaid.  Costs to inclusion  A large body of research examines the way that racial composition, welfare structure, and immigrant population determine how states include immigrants in welfare. Research shows that a larger percentage of African-American recipients leads to stricter rules governing initial eligibility, less flexibility in welfare work requirements, and lower cash benefits to welfare recipients. There is also a negative relationship between cash benefit levels and percentage of welfare recipients. In analyzing the effects of PRWORA, Hero and Preuhs find that the most inclusive states offer more assistance and welfare generosity to immigrants. These states, however, face challenges in allocating funds due to a larger minority population and cut individual benefit levels per recipient. Moreover, these states assess the costs for inclusion based on racial compositions in the state. In terms of TANF benefits, the most inclusive states have had the largest decline in benefit levels. For example, California has seen a 22.6% decrease in TANF benefit levels for a family of three. = Addressing concerns = Regardless of incorporation, welfare effort and TANF benefits decline as the Latino population grows from a nominal size to 10 percent of the population. After that point, incorporation influences policy in a distinct manner. While incorporation is a function of population, it is not perfectly responsive considering the populations that would perceive benefits (i.e. population greater than 10%) only grew from five states in 1984 to ten in 2001. The remaining states exhibited negative relationships between Latino population and welfare generosity with legislative incorporation not overcoming this phenomenon. The last major reform effort of PRWORA was in 2002 when the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill to reauthorize legislation to restore some of the benefits stripped by the act. The bill reauthorized federal funds for TANF and healthcare services. The House, however, failed to authorize the bill. Consequences Unemployment rate during the Clinton administration. The orange line indicates when PRWORA was signed.Welfare and poverty rates both declined during the late 1990s, leading many commentators to declare that the legislation was a success. One editorial in The New Republic opined, \\"A broad consensus now holds that welfare reform was certainly not a disaster‚Äîand that it may, in fact, have worked much as its designers had hoped.\\"September 4, 2006, editorial on page 7 However, the number of welfare recipients declined much more sharply than the poverty rate, with a national average of 56% reduction in welfare caseloads and 1% reduction in poverty. The number of children living in extreme poverty, defined as a household income below 50% of the poverty line,What is ‚Äúdeep poverty‚Äù? UC Davis Center for Poverty Research, 16 Jan. 2018. Accessed 18 Apr. 2019. increased, with a sharper increase among African-American families. PRWORA redirected the responsibility for service provisions from federal administrations to state administrations, leading to greater inequality between states as one program was replaced by 50. States were given control over the amount of money dedicated to social safety net programs. States also gained the ability to impose rules and restrictions on how people could access and use social services. =Impact on federal budget= The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated in March 1999 that the TANF basic block grant (authorization to spend) would total $16.5 billion annually through 2002, with the amount allocated to each state based on the state's spending history. These block grant amounts proved to be more than the states could initially spend, as AFDC and TANF caseloads dropped by 40% from 1994 to 1998 due to the booming economy. As a result, states had accumulated surpluses which could be spent in future years. States also had the flexibility to use these funds for child care and other programs. CBO also estimated that TANF outlays (actual spending) would total $12.6 billion in fiscal years 1999 and 2000, grow to $14.2 billion by 2002, and reach $19.4 billion by 2009. For scale, total spending in FY 2000 was approximately $2,000 billion, so this represents around 0.6%. Further, CBO estimated that unspent balances would grow from $7.1 billion in 1998 to $25.4 billion by 2005. =Impact on caseloads and employment= The law's effect goes far beyond the minor budget impact, however. The Brookings Institution reported in 2006 that: \\"With its emphasis on work, time limits, and sanctions against states that did not place a large fraction of its caseload in work programs and against individuals who refused to meet state work requirements, TANF was a historic reversal of the entitlement welfare represented by AFDC. If the 1996 reforms had their intended effect of reducing welfare dependency, a leading indicator of success would be a declining welfare caseload. TANF administrative data reported by states to the federal government show that caseloads began declining in the spring of 1994 and fell even more rapidly after the federal legislation was enacted in 1996. Between 1994 and 2005, the caseload declined about 60 percent. The number of families receiving cash welfare is now the lowest it has been since 1969, and the percentage of children on welfare is lower than it has been since 1966.\\" The effects were particularly significant on single mothers; the portion of employed single mothers grew from 58% in 1993 to 75% by 2000. Employment among never-married mothers increased from 44% to 66%. =Impact on crime= A 2017 study in the American Economic Review, examined the effects of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, found that public assistance eligibility for drug offenders reduces one-year recidivism rates by 10 percent. = Single-mother households and \\"disconnected\\" families = Jason DeParle of the New York Times, after interviews with single mothers, said that they have been left without means to survive, and have turned to desperate and sometimes illegal ways to survive, including shoplifting, selling blood, scavenging trash bins, moving in with friends, and returning to violent partners.Jason DeParle, \\"Welfare Limits Left Poor Adrift as Recession Hit\\", New York Times, April 7, 2012 A study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities stated that cutting access to welfare through the PRWORA was \\"a major factor in the lack of progress in reducing poverty among people in working single-mother families after 1995\\". While there was improvement in poverty rates for families not headed by single mothers, poor single mother households overall sunk further into poverty. Economists focusing on antipoverty policy have identified higher percentages of \\"disconnected\\" single mother households following the welfare legislation of the 1990s‚Äî households in extreme poverty that do not receive government assistance or wages from employment.Thomas, Susan L. \\"'Ending Welfare as We Know It,'\\" or Farewell to the Rights of Women on Welfare? A Constitutional and Human Rights Analysis of the Personal Responsibility Act.\\" University of Detroit Mercy Law Review 78.2 2001: p. 179-202. Hollins Digital Commons. Web. A study conducted by economists at Rutgers University found that states with stricter limits on receiving benefits before one is required to find work cause more single mothers to become disconnected. These state rules, having been created after the loosening of federal authority by PRWORA, are identified as key considerations in the disconnecting of single mothers. = Earned Income Tax Credit Effect = Besides the economic trends occurring during the passing and implementation of PRWORA; researchers cannot pinpoint the exact factors that led to the decrease in enrollment in AFDC/TANF, even in times of economic downturn. Some labor economists argue that the continuing decline in AFDC/TANF enrollment was not due to improved standard of living but offset by an exponential growth in the Earned Income Tax Credit, which by 2012 was the largest cash-benefit entitlement program in the United States. = Dot Com Bubble and Crash of 2008 = The first tests for persistent effects on income and household financial health under PRWORA were the recession caused by the 2001 tech bubble crash and the 2008 economic meltdown caused by the housing bubble and the instability of the financial markets. During these two periods of economic problems, the enrollment in TANF followed a downwards trend. As enrollment in TANF decreased, macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment rate, number of children in poverty and extreme poverty, and number of single-parent households below the poverty line followed an upwards trend with sharp increases during the late 2007-2009 recession. Alleging that enrollment in the program did not track poverty, critics of welfare reform point to this as a failure of the PRWORA. Criticism Frances Fox Piven said that the problem with AFDC was not a problem with the welfare system, but with low-wage work: > Logically, but not in the heated and vitriolic politics created by the > attack on welfare, a concern with the relationship of welfare to dependency > should have directed attention to the deteriorating conditions of the low- > wage labor market. After all, if there were jobs that paid living wages, and > if health care and child care were available, a great many women on AFDC > would leap at the chance of a better income and a little social respect. PRWORA has been accused of attempting to fight poverty by ‚Äúcontrolling the reproductive capacity of women, compelling unmarried mothers to work outside the home, and coercing women into relations with men.‚Äù Barbara Ehrenreich, a feminist political activist, has said that the bill was motivated by racism and misogyny, using stereotypes of lazy, overweight, slovenly, sexually indulgent and \\"endlessly fecund\\" African-American welfare recipients, and assumed that out-of-wedlock births were \\"illegitimate\\" and that only a male could confer respectability on a child. PRWORA dismissed the value of the unpaid work of raising a family, and insisted that mothers get paid work, \\"no matter how dangerous, abusive, or poorly paid\\".Chamber of Welfare Reform, Barbara Ehrenreich, The Progressive, June 21, 2001 Three assistant secretaries at the Department of Health and Human Services, Mary Jo Bane, Peter B. Edelman, and Wendell E. Primus, resigned to protest the law.Two Clinton Aides Resign to Protests New Welfare Law\\", New York Times 11 September 1996 According to Edelman, the 1996 welfare reform law destroyed the safety net. It increased poverty, lowered income for single mothers, put people from welfare into homeless shelters, and left states free to eliminate welfare entirely. It moved mothers and children from welfare to work, but many of them are not making enough to survive. Many of them were pushed off welfare rolls because they didn't show up for an appointment, because they could not get to an appointment for lack of child care, said Edelman, or because they were not notified of the appointment.Poverty & Welfare: Does Compassionate Conservatism Have a Heart?\\", Peter B. Edelman, 64 Albany Law Review 1076, 2000-2001.\\"The Worst Thing Bill Clinton Has Done\\", Peter Edelman, The Atlantic Monthly, March 1997 = Causes of poverty = Welfare reform efforts such as PRWORA have been criticized for focusing almost exclusively on individual failure and irresponsibility, especially among people of color, as factors leading to poverty. However, there is no scholarly consensus on the etiology of poverty, and many theories focus instead on structural inequalities such as disparities in pay and hiring discrimination. The concept of \\"personal responsibility\\" is further critiqued for its lack of consideration of familial responsibilities, such as caring for children and elderly parents, which are placed more heavily upon women.The Status of Women in the States, 2002. District of Columbia: Institute for Women's Policy Research, 2002. Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600-2000 Database. = Propagating stereotypes = Many critics have argued that the PRWORA bases its reasoning on the stereotype of single black mothers who receive welfare, commonly known as the ‚Äúwelfare queen.‚Äù Mink, Gwendolyn. \\"From Welfare to Wedlock: Marriage Promotion and Poor Mothers' Inequality.\\" The Good Society, vol. 11 no. 3, 2002, pp. 68-73. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/gso.2003.0011 The welfare queen is one who often deliberately and intentionally becomes pregnant in order to increase their welfare. The woman is envisioned as being lazy, uncaring of her children (who are also stereotyped as having been born out-of-wedlock), and unwilling to work. This version of the woman is labelled as ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù of their welfare. = Gendered and racial poverty = The bill has also been criticized for ignoring and not accommodating for the complexities of gender, color, and sexual preference discrimination within society that contribute to the poverty of people of color, women, and non-heterosexual people. Diana Pearce, the director of the Center for Women‚Äôs Welfare, writes that poverty for women is fundamentally different from that for men, but welfare itself is created for poor menPearce, Diana. \\"Welfare is Not for Women: Toward a Model of Advocacy to Meet the Needs of Women in Poverty.\\" Clearinghouse Review, vol. 19, no. 4, Summer 1985, pp. 412-418. HeinOnline, https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/clear19&i;=416.. She asserts that women‚Äôs poverty is caused by two problems that are unique for women: the responsibility to provide all or most financial support for their children and the disadvantages they face in the labor market. In 1988, the average woman received 66 percent of the income of what an average man earned; the average female college graduate working a full-time job still earned less than the average male high school graduate.U.S. Bureau of the Census, Money Income: 1988 But the earnings disparity is not the only form of disadvantage that women face in the labor market. Many women are unable to obtain a full time job not just due to gender discrimination, but also because of unavailable, expensive, or inadequate day care. This problem is only amplified when considering the issue of the segregation of women into underpaid work, limiting possibilities of economic growth.Reskin, Barbara. ‚ÄúSex Segregation in the Workplace.‚Äù Annual Review of Sociology, vol. 19, 1993, pp. 241‚Äì270. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2083388. Susan L. Thomas made similar arguments, stating that these disadvantages were created from masculinism. She argued that masculinism gives men more roles in the labor market, while reserving the responsibility of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and reproduction to (white) women, resulting in a loss of opportunities for promotions and pressure on women to prioritize their domestic duties and to work jobs that can accommodate for these duties. She asserts that welfare systems, including PRWORA, were not made for women, because they have been created based on the male Breadwinner model, which believes that people are poor because they are jobless and the solution is to give them jobs. But because of the discrimination women faced, simply finding full-time jobs that paid enough money for independence from welfare is not easy for poor women, Thomas proclaimed and added, ‚Äúfor women it is not the lack of employment that leads to their disproportionately high rates of poverty, rather their poverty stems from the ideological consequences of a gender-biased structuring of the distribution of power and privilege.‚Äù Thomas then criticized the bill for not taking all these factors into consideration when deciding who is ‚Äúworthy‚Äù and ‚Äúunworthy‚Äù of welfare. = Violation of universal human rights = The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act has continuously been criticized for its violations of universal human rights. Susan L. Thomas, a professor at Hollins University, wrote the bill violates Articles 2, 5 and 16 of the Women‚Äôs Convention as it allows states to fail to ‚Äúcondemn discrimination in all its forms‚Äù, by promoting patriarchal, heterosexual marriage; discriminating against unmarried mothers and women of color; and infringing on women‚Äôs constitutional rights to privacy and procreation. Gwendolyn Mink, an Associate Professor of Politics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has criticized TANF for using marriage as a means of ‚Äúprivatizing poverty, reaffirming patriarchy, and spotlighting women of color as moral failures.‚Äù  Violation of women's constitutional rights  PRWORA requires unmarried mothers to identify the father and receive child support from said father. If mothers refuse to comply with these requirements, then their assistance grant is either reduced by at least 25 percent or withheld completely from them by their state.42 U.S. Code ¬ß 608 (a) (2) The bill also confers the legal status of parent to the biological fathers, and require unmarried mothers to permit biological fathers to develop ‚Äúsubstantial relationships‚Äù with their children and to have a claim on the rearing of their children; this is the opposite of paternity law, which holds the ‚Äúsubstantial relationship‚Äù a prerequisite to parental rights. These requirements have been criticized for violating women‚Äôs constitutional right to family privacy and their decisions about child-rearing and family life,M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 116 (1996) (quoting Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 376 (1971)) and ignoring the danger that establishing a connection with an abusive father may cause for both the mother and her children. PRWORA requires states to submit a written documentation of their goals and strategies to reduce non-marital pregnancies and births, even offering a financial incentive of $20 million each to five states with the largest declines in their ‚Äúillegitimacy ratios‚Äù and abortion rates.42 U.S.C. S 603 (a) (2) (C) (i) (I) (aa); 42 U.S.C. S 603 (b) It is argued that this has resulted in states making abortions more inaccessible and legally punishing childbearing by not granting more assistance to families even after the number of children increases. This policy has been criticized for being a punitive system that violates the rights of both the women and their children by intruding on the mothers‚Äô constitutional rights to procreation,Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535 (1942) privacy,Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) and reproductive choice,Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) which includes their decisions to be a parentPlanned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 859-61 (1992) or not;Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) and penalizing mothers for exercising their right to have children. Susan L. Thomas has pointed out the bill fails to prove enough governmental interest warrants its child exclusionary policy and attempts to conserve money through the penalization of women who exercise their constitutional reproductive rights.  Discrimination against unmarried women and non- heterosexual women  When the bill was passed, critics denounced the bill for promoting and enforcing heterosexual marriage, which they argued was made implicit in the bill itself as it states: (1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society. (2) Marriage is an essential constitution of a successful society, which promotes the interests of children. (3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is integral to successful child rearing and well being of children.Conference Report on H.R. 3734, Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, 114 CONG. REC. H. 8831, 142 (daily ed. July 30, 1996) The bill was also stated to discriminate against mothers ‚Äúwho parent[ed] without legal partners.‚Äù Mothers who ‚Äúencourage[d] the formation and maintenance of [heterosexual] two-parent families‚Äù did not have to work outside the home, even if them not working forced the family to continue to require state assistance. However, mothers who could not or did not want to find men to marry them were required to work outside the home, and unmarried mothers who had received state assistance for two months were required to perform community service.42 U.S.C. ¬ß 607 (a) (1) It also required single mothers who had received up to twenty four months of financial assistance, consecutively or not, to work outside the home thirty hours a week, and penalized mothers who did not work thirty hours a week by reducing or terminating her benefits. Critics have accused PRWORA for discriminating against unmarried women who have never been married, as they are required to ‚Äúreveal the details of their children‚Äôs conception to state officials‚Äù, while divorced, unmarried women are exempt from submitting information, as PRWORA assumes the biological father of the children is the man to whom they were married to when the child was conceived. This has been criticized for violating the women‚Äôs 14th Amendment right to make marital decisions without governmental interference (based on Loving v. Virginia) and coercing women into creating or maintaining relationships with the biological fathers; this interference also does not satisfy the heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. = Strict regulations = PRWORA has been criticized for its terms, which permit all states to not assist people in poverty, even if they meet all the necessary criteria. It also does not offer additional federal funds to states that have depleted their block grant and contingency funds, thus leaving mothers and children (who meet the eligibility criteria) with no financial assistance. States are granted more freedom to create regulations that are stricter than federal laws. This manifests in regulations that: * Make women work outside the home sooner than is required * Create shorter working time limits than is required * Allow states to withhold cash benefits in cases where single mothers do not identify the biological father of her children * Discriminate households in which children are born while the mother is enrolled in welfare by not giving said households benefits * Withhold welfare from mothers whose children do not attend school without an explanation * Sanction households with adults younger than fifty-one who do not have and are not actively working to receive a high school diploma * Require drug tests of recipients * Enforce welfare regulations of former states for new state residents * Do not require states to provide cash benefits at all = Impeding access to higher education and employment = Diana Spatz, executive director of Lifetime, a statewide organization of low- income parents in California, advocates for the repeal of PRWORA because it prevents a woman from doing what she did prior to its passage: earn her bachelor's degree while supported by welfare.Diana Spatz, \\"The End of Welfare as I Knew It\\", The Nation, 2 January 2012 Vanessa D. Johnson, a professor at Northeastern University, asserts that the implementation of PRWORA cut access for single mothers, namely African American single mothers, to attaining a higher education for themselves. By creating time limits that force them into working without finishing a degree, Johnson says African American single mothers are left unable to better themselves through education. With education having such a strong correlation to higher wages, she considers it crucial that welfare policies allow for mothers to attend college in order to lift themselves out of poverty. Another criticism placed on PRWORA by some scholars is that its transition to work provisions negatively affect the ability of low-income mothers enrolled in the program to find a job. Single mothers enrolled in TANF tend to have lower rates of literacy, and therefore finding employment that within the time frame of the \\"workfare\\" component becomes more difficult, or leads to underemployment. Welfare-to-work programs have also been criticized for only offering training for low-wage work. An education- first approach has been proposed as an alternative that could provide welfare recipients with more options for employment. Although the incentivization of financial independence is a goal for both recipients and providers, many TANF enrollees feel disincentivized from finding paid work due to low pay and the instability of this transition. = Varying rates of success = Critics of the law argue that poverty in America increased from 1979 onward after Reagan's presidential campaign criticized deficit spendingAthens County Department of Job and Family Services, January 2012, p. 5, Did Welfare Reform Work? Athens, Ohio: Athens County Department of Job and Family Services and that the temporary large reduction in the number of people collecting welfare was largely a result of steady and strong economic growth in the years following enactment of the law. Political scientist Joe Soss questions the definition of success, asking whether \\"success\\", as measured by caseload reduction, was merely a political construction for policy makers to easily claim credit in front of their constituencies. In analyzing the effects of welfare reform, he notes that caseload reduction is not very demanding, especially compared to improving material conditions in poor communities: > The TANF program does not offer benefits sufficient to lift recipients out > of poverty, and despite a strong economy, the majority of families who have > moved off the TANF rolls have remained in poverty. Considerations of another > traditional economic goal, reduction of inequality, only makes matters > worse. Welfare reform has coincided with massive growth in income and wealth > disparities; it has done little to slow the expansion of inequality and may > have actually accelerated the trend. Has welfare reform created job > opportunities for the poor? Has it promoted wages that allow low-wage > workers to escape poverty? In both of these areas, the economic story > remains the same: we have little evidence that reform has produced > achievements that warrant the label of success.

The victory by colonial Virginia militia forces led to the departure of Royal Governor Lord Dunmore and any remaining vestiges of British power over the Colony of Virginia during the early days of the conflict. Following increasing political and military tensions in early 1775, both Dunmore and colonial rebel leaders recruited troops and engaged in a struggle for available military supplies. The struggle eventually focused on Norfolk, where Dunmore had taken refuge aboard a Royal Navy vessel. Dunmore's forces had fortified one side of a critical river crossing south of Norfolk at Great Bridge, while rebel forces had occupied the other side. In an attempt to break up the rebel gathering, Dunmore ordered an attack across the bridge, which was decisively repulsed. Colonel William Woodford, the Virginia militia commander at the battle, described it as \\"a second Bunker's Hill affair\\". Shortly thereafter, Norfolk, at the time a Loyalist center, was abandoned by Dunmore and the Tories, who fled to navy ships in the harbor. Rebel-occupied Norfolk was destroyed on January 1, 1776 in an action begun by Dunmore and completed by rebel forces. Background Tensions in the British Colony of Virginia were raised in April 1775 at roughly the same time that the hostilities of the American Revolutionary War broke out in the Province of Massachusetts Bay with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, had dismissed the colonial legislative assembly, the House of Burgesses, who then established a provisional assembly in Virginia Conventions. The Burgesses authorized existing and newly raised militia troops to arm themselves, leading to a struggle for control of the colony's military supplies. Under orders from Lord Dunmore, British forces removed gunpowder from the colonial storehouse in the capital of Williamsburg, causing a confrontation between royal and militia forces.Wilson, p. 7 Although the incident was resolved without violence, Dunmore, fearing for his personal safety, left Williamsburg in June 1775 and placed his family on board a Royal Navy ship.Russell, p. 53 A small British fleet then took shape at Norfolk, a port town whose merchants had significant Loyalist (Tory) tendencies. The threat posed by the British fleet may also have played a role in minimizing Whig activity in the town.Russell, p. 55 Incidents continued between rebels on one side and loyalists (Tories) on the other until October, when Dunmore had acquired enough military support to begin operations against the rebellious colonists. General Thomas Gage, the British commander-in-chief for North America, had ordered small detachments of the 14th Regiment of Foot to Virginia in response to pleas by Dunmore for military help. These troops began raiding surrounding counties for rebel military supplies on October 12. This activity continued through the end of October, when a small British ship ran aground and was captured by rebels during a skirmish near Hampton. Navy boats sent to punish the townspeople were repulsed by colonial militia in a brief gunfight that resulted in the killing and capture of several sailors.Russell, p. 68 Dunmore reacted to this event by issuing a proclamation on November 7 in which he declared martial law, and offered to emancipate colonist slaves in Virginia willing to serve in the British Army. The proclamation alarmed rebel and loyalist slaveholders alike, concerned by the idea of armed former slaves and the potential loss of their property.Wilson, p. 8 Nevertheless, Dunmore was able to recruit enough slaves to form the Ethiopian Regiment, as well as raising a company of Tories he called the Queen's Own Loyal Virginia Regiment (later absorbed into the Queen's Rangers in 1776). These local forces supplemented the two companies of the 14th Foot, and in addition to the naval forces, that were the sole British military presence in the colony.Wilson, p. 9 This successful recruiting drive prompted Dunmore to write on November 30, 1775 that he would soon be able to \\"reduce this colony to a proper sense of their duty.\\"Kranish, p. 79 Prelude Detail from a 1775 map showing the Norfolk area. Oriented with North to the bottom, Fort Murray is visible near the top of the map. Lord Dunmore had, on arrival in Norfolk, ordered the fortification of the bridge across the Elizabeth River, about south of Norfolk in the village of Great Bridge. The bridge formed a natural defense point since it was on the only road leading south from Norfolk toward North Carolina, it was bordered on both sides by the Great Dismal Swamp, and the access to the bridge on both sides was via narrow causeways. Dunmore sent 25 men of the 14th Foot to the bridge, where they erected a small stockade fort they called Fort Murray on the Norfolk side of the bridge. They also removed the bridge planking to make crossing it more difficult. The fort was armed with two cannons and several smaller swivel guns. The men of the 14th were augmented by small companies from the Ethiopian and Queen's Own regiments, bringing the garrison size to between 40 and 80 men. In response to Dunmore's proclamation, Virginia's assembly ordered its militia troops to march on Norfolk. William Woodford, the colonel leading the 2nd Virginia Regiment, advanced toward the bridge with his regiment of 400 and about 100 riflemen from the Culpeper Minutemen. On December 2 they arrived at the bridge and set up a camp across the bridge from the British fort. Upon their arrival the British set about destroying buildings near the fort to ensure a clear field of fire. Woodford was at first unwilling to assault the British position, thinking he lacked enough cannons to overcome an overly generous estimate of the garrison's strength. He therefore began entrenching his position, while more and more militia companies arrived from the surrounding counties and North Carolina. Some cannons eventually arrived with a contingent of North Carolina men, but they were useless because they lacked mountings and carriages. Woodford also became concerned when he heard rumors that a large number of Scottish Highlanders had joined Dunmore's forces. The rumors were partly true: the Highlanders were in fact 120 families, but few of the men were skilled at arms.Wilson, p. 10 By December 8, the force in the militia camp had grown to nearly 900, with more than 700 fit for duty.Wilson, p. 11 John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore Dunmore learned that the colonial militia had acquired cannons, but was unaware they were inoperable. Concerned for the safety of the garrison, he decided an attack on their position was necessary. His plan called for a diversionary attack by the Ethiopian companies of the garrison at a spot downriver from the bridge to draw the militia's attention, while the garrison, reinforced by additional troops from Norfolk, would attack across the bridge in the early morning light. Battle Dunmore's best intelligence had informed him that the rebel forces numbered about 400. On the night and morning of December 8 and 9 Captain Samuel Leslie led reinforcements down to Fort Murray, arriving around 3:00 am. Upon his arrival he learned that the Ethiopian detachment intended for the diversion was not in the fort. They had been dispatched on a routine deployment to another nearby crossing, and Dunmore had failed to send orders ensuring their availability for the operation. Leslie decided to proceed with the attack anyway. After resting his troops until a little before dawn, he sent men out to replace the bridge planking. Once this was finished, Captain Charles Fordyce led a company of 60 grenadiers across the bridge. They briefly skirmished with militia sentries, raising the alarm in the camp beyond the entrenchments. Fordyce's men were then joined by a company of navy gunners who had been brought along to operate the field artillery for the attack, while the Tory companies arrayed themselves on the Norfolk side of the bridge.Wilson, p. 12 The militia leadership in the camp at first thought the early skirmishing was a typical morning salute, and paid it little heed. Shortly after reveille, the severity of the alarm became apparent. While the camp mobilized, a militia company numbering about sixty prepared for the British advance behind the earthworks. They carefully withheld fire until the grenadiers, advancing with bayonets fixed, were within , and then unleashed a torrent of fire on the British column. Fordyce, leading the column, went down in a hail of musket fire just steps from the earthworks along with many of the men in the front ranks. The British advance dissolved as the militia musket fire continued; about half of Fordyce's force was killed, and many were injured. The navy gunners provided covering fire as they retreated back across the bridge, but their small cannons made no impression on the earthworks. Colonel Woodford had by this time organized the forces in the rebel camp, and they marched out to face the British. After an inconsequential exchange of musket fire at long range, Woodford sent the riflemen of the Culpeper Minutemen off to the left. From this position the riflemen, whose weapons had a much longer range than muskets, began to fire on the British position on the far side of the bridge. The navy gunners, with the only weapons the British had available to contest the riflemen at that range, were now out of position, and were also being threatened by the large militia force approaching the earthworks. They spiked their guns and retreated across the bridge, and Captain Leslie ordered his men to retreat into Fort Murray. In some 25 minutes, Dunmore's attempt to stop the rebel buildup near Norfolk had been emphatically turned back.Hibbert, p. 103 Aftermath Sketch made in 1850 of Great Bridge Following a truce to permit the British to remove their dead and wounded, the Tory forces sneaked out in the night to return to Norfolk. Captain Fordyce was buried with full military honors by the rebels near the site of the battle. Casualty estimates ranged from Dunmore's official report of 62 killed or wounded to an escaped patriot's report that the British losses totaled 102, excluding militia casualties.Wilson, p. 13 The only claimed rebel casualty was one man with a slight wound to the thumb.Russell, p. 72 Colonel William Woodford, reporting on the 2nd Virginia Regiment's service at the battle, wrote in a letter published in Purdie's Virginia Gazette, December 15, 1775: \\"This was a second Bunker's Hill affair, in miniature; with this difference, that we kept our post, and had only one man wounded in the hand.\\" The Virginia militia forces were then reinforced by the arrival of troops from North Carolina under Colonel Robert Howe. Dunmore blamed Leslie for his decision to attack without the accompanying diversion, although the outcome of the battle may not have been different even with the diversion, given the disparity in force sizes.Wilson, p. 15 In the following days, Dunmore and his Tory supporters took refuge on ships of the Royal Navy, and Norfolk was occupied by the victorious rebel forces. The danger Dunmore posed to the rebel cause, however, had not been eliminated. General George Washington, commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and a Virginian who knew Dunmore well, wrote a letter to Charles Lee in late December, warning of continued danger despite Dunmore's flight to the navy. He told Lee that \\"if that Man is not crushed before Spring, he will become the most formidable Enemy America has\\", and that \\"nothing less than depriving him of life or liberty will secure peace to Virginia.\\" After a series of escalations over the rebel's refusal to allow provisions to be delivered to the overcrowded vessels, Dunmore and Commodore Henry Pellow decided to bombard the town.Russell, p. 73 On January 1, 1776, Norfolk was destroyed in action begun by Royal Navy ships and their landing parties, but completed by rebel troops that continued to loot and burn the former Tory stronghold.Russell, pp. 73‚Äì74 Lord Dunmore occupied Portsmouth in February 1776, and used it as a base for raiding operations until late March, when General Charles Lee successfully forced him back to the fleet. After further raiding operations in the Chesapeake, Dunmore and the British fleet left for New York City in August 1776. Dunmore never returned to Virginia.Russell, pp. 75‚Äì76 A highway marker was placed by the state of Virginia in 1934 near the battle site.HMDB battle marker In response to construction threats to the battlefield, local citizens organized in 1999 to preserve the area.

It lies caudal to the substantia nigra and adjacent to the superior cerebellar peduncle. It has two divisions of subnuclei; the pars compacta containing mainly cholinergic neurons, and the pars dissipata containing mainly glutamatergic neurons and some non-cholinergic neurons. The pedunculopontine nucleus is one of the main components of the reticular activating system. It was first described in 1909 by Louis Jacobsohn-Lask, a German neuroanatomist.√úber die Kerne des menschlichen Hirnstamms (Medulla oblongata, Pons und Pedunculus cerebri), Berlin, 1909. pag. 58, fig. 22 Projections Pedunculopontine nucleus neurons project axons to a wide range of areas in the brain, particularly parts of the basal ganglia such as the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, and globus pallidus internus. It also sends them to targets in the thalamus, cerebellum, basal forebrain, and lower brainstem, and in the cerebral cortex, the supplementary motor area and somatosensory and motor cortices. It receives inputs from many areas of the brain, including the basal ganglia to which it projects with the exception of the substantia nigra pars compacta to which it projects but does not receive, while it receives but does not project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Functions The pedunculopontine nucleus is involved in many functions, including arousal, attention, learning, reward, and voluntary limb movements and locomotion. While once thought important to the initiation of movement, recent research suggests a role in providing sensory feedback to the cerebral cortex. It is also implicated in the generation and maintenance of REM sleep. Recent research has discovered that the pedunculopontine nucleus is involved in the planning of movement, and that different networks of neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus are switched on during real and imagined movement. Parkinson disease Research is being done on whether deep brain stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus might be used to improve the gait and postural difficulties found in Parkinson disease.

Although his first sporting passion was football, he was too small to compete in high school football. Instead, he joined Lake Oswego High School's swim team, and in 1960, helped lead the team to an Oregon state swimming championship as a freshman. Olympics As a teenager in 1962, Schollander moved to Santa Clara, California to train under swim coach George Haines of the Santa Clara Swim Club. Two years later at the age of 18, he won three freestyle events at the AAU national championships. He made the U.S. Olympic team in two individual events and two relays. Months later, he won four gold medals and set three world records at the 1964 Summer Olympics, at the time the most medals won by an American since Jesse Owens in 1936. His success helped earn him the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States, and the AP Athlete of the Year, defeating runner-up Johnny Unitas by a wide margin. He was also named ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year. Schollander appeared on an episode of To Tell the Truth immediately after winning his four gold medals. College and Olympic swimming Schollander attended Yale College and is a member of Skull and Bones, a secret society, and the Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter) fraternity, as was the future President George W. Bush. He was the captain of Yale's swim team, winning three individual NCAA championships. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, Schollander won another gold medal in the 4√ó200-meter freestyle relay, but finished second in the 200-meter freestyle, the event that Schollander had considered to be his best. This was the first Olympics in which 200-meter swimming events were part of the competition. Following the 1968 Olympics, Schollander retired from competitive swimming. After swimming Schollander was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at age 19 in 1965. In 1983, he was one of the first group of inductees into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. He is also a member of Oregon Sports Hall of Fame. In 1971, he published his first book, Deep Water (with Duke Savage) chronicling his swimming, his teammates and coaches, and the behind-the-scenes politics of international swimming, especially the Olympic Games. He followed this book in 1974 with Inside Swimming (with Joel H. Cohen). Schollander and his wife Cheryl reside in Lake Oswego, Oregon, where he runs Schollander Development, a real estate development company. His gold medals are on display to the public at a Bank of America branch location in downtown Lake Oswego. Schollander has three children, Jeb, Kyle and Katie.

The series parodied American attitudes toward the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War. Set in Moscow, the sitcom starred Lou Jacobi as a Russian hotel waiter named Ivan Petrovsky and the day- to-day misadventures of Ivan's family plus their Cuban exchange student boarder; all of whom live in a cramped, one-bedroom apartment. (The one bedroom being occupied by the family's extremely vicious and feral Russian wolfhound, \\"Rasputin\\", who was frequently heard barking and growling, despite the fact that this is almost unheard of behavior for that breed of dog, but never seen.) Also appearing in this series were Christopher Hewett, Phil Leeds, Alan Cauldwell and, in her TV series debut, Nana Visitor (here billed under her birth name, Nana Tucker). Harvey Korman appeared as a Soviet bureaucrat in an uncredited cameo at the close of each episode. The executive producer of this series was Alan King.
