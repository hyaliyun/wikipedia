The borders closely resemble those of the provinces that were there before. Organization The Kuchkabals were divided into municipalities called batalib (plural batalibob), and each Batalib was ruled by a batab (batabob plural). The ruler of a Kuchkabal was called a Halach Uinik, which means \\"real man\\". A Halach Uinik was a monarch, but some kuchkabals were oligarchies, with batabil having a seat on a senate. As in the case of Ekab one batalib usually had more powerful batabob. The batabob were normally related to the Halach Uinik. Rebellion and war against the Cocom Since 987, when the Toltecs went into decline, the League of Mayapan had been the main power in Yucatan. In 1441 the league had a civil war between the Cocom and Tutul Xiues. The rest of the league took advantage of the war and rebelled. By 1461 the League of Mayapan had been completely disintegrated into seventeen Kuchkabals. Other nations declared independence during this time and before. They were Tabasco, Acalan, Yalain, Kowoj, the Itza Kingdom, Mopan, Kejache, Cocom, and Ch'orti'. The Kuchkabals At the time of the breakup of the League of Mayapan in 1441 there were seventeen Kuchabals: Ekab, Chakan Putum, Ah Canul, Ceh Pech, Tutul-Xiu, Sotuta, Hocaba, Chakan, Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, Tazes, Chikinchel, Uaymil, Chactemal, Cochuah, Can Pech, and Calotmul. Calotmul was conquered by the Tutul-Xiues. A year after the Spanish conquest in 1547, the Mayas rebelled and formed a kuchkabal in the north east of Yucatan. Its capital was Zaci in Cupul.

It was released as a lead single from his sixth studio solo album, You Bought It ‚Äì You Name It, being Walsh's eleventh single. Meaning The song was written during the latter part of the 1980s video arcade craze, and its lyrics are a personal commentary, critical of then-modern American culture against Walsh's older pinball and pool generation. The lyrics also reflect a satirical view on this, with lines such as: \\"I feel a little bit mixed up, maybe I'm obsolete\\". Promotional video The music video starts out in an old-fashioned arcade in black and white. Walsh, pushes his way up to a pinball machine. The video then turns to colour - depicting that he's in the present. Now, there's a bunch of video games instead of pinball machines, Walsh tries to talk to the kids sitting around but they ignore him. They show the old pinball arcade and everyone is covered with cobwebs. Here are scenes of Walsh and his band where Walsh is dressed in a jumpsuit with sunglasses and an Indian-style headband with a feather on the side.

The report's authors estimated fires caused 12,000 deaths, 300,000 serious injuries and $11.4 billion in property damage annually in the United States, asserting that \\"the richest and most technologically advanced nation in the world leads all the major industrialized countries in per capita deaths and property loss from fire.\\" The report proposed that a federal agency be established to help combat the growing problem of fatal fires happening throughout the country. The S. 1769 legislation was passed by the 93rd Congressional session and enacted by the 38th President of the United States Gerald Ford on October 29, 1974. Provisions of the FPCA The Act of Congress created a national superintendence for the administrative and organizational parameters of local and State government firefighting entities. The Act established the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration, National Academy for Fire Prevention and Control, and a National Fire Data Center. =Congressional Findings= :Congress finds that ‚Äî ::(1) The National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control has made an exhaustive and comprehensive examination of the Nation's fire problem, has made detailed findings as to the extent of this problem in terms of human suffering and loss of life and property, and has made ninety recommendations. ::(2) The United States has the highest per capita rate of death and property loss from fire of all the major industrialized nations in the world. ::(3) Fire is an undue burden affecting all Americans, and fire also constitutes a public health and safety problem of great dimensions. Fire kills 12,000 and scars and injures 300,000 Americans each year, including 50,000 individuals who require extended hospitalization. Almost $3 billion worth of property is destroyed annually by fire, and the total economic cost of destructive fire in the United States is estimated conservatively to be $11,000,000,000 per year. Firefighting is the Nation's most hazardous profession. ::(4) Such losses of life and property from fire are unacceptable to the Congress. ::(5) While fire prevention and control is and should remain a State and local responsibility, the Federal Government must help if a significant reduction in fire losses is to be achieved. ::(6) The fire service and the civil defense program in each locality would both benefit from closer cooperation. ::(7) The Nation's fire problem is exacerbated by ‚Äî :::(A) Indifference with which some Americans confront the subject :::(B) Nation's failure to undertake enough research and development into fire and fire-related problems :::(C) Scarcity of reliable data and information :::(D) Fact that designers and purchasers of buildings and products generally give insufficient attention to fire safety :::(E) Fact that many communities lack adequate building and fire prevention codes :::(F) Fact that local fire departments spend about 95 cents of every dollar appropriated to the fire services on efforts to extinguish fires and only about 5 cents on fire prevention ::(8) There is a need for improved professional training and education oriented toward improving the effectiveness of the fire services, including an increased emphasis on preventing fires and on reducing injuries to firefighters. ::(9) A national system for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of fire data is needed to help local fire services establish research and action priorities. ::(10) The number of specialized medical centers which are properly equipped and staffed for the treatment of burns and there habilitation of victims of fires is inadequate. ::(11) The unacceptably high rates of death, injury, and property loss from fire can be reduced if the Federal Government establishes a coordinated program to support and reinforce the fire prevention and control activities of State and local governments. =Establishment of the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration= :The National Fire Prevention and Control Administration is authorized to educate the public and to overcome public indifference as to fire and fire prevention. Such steps may include, but are not limited to, publications, audio visual presentations, and demonstrations. Such public education efforts shall include programs to provide specialized information for those groups of individuals who are particularly vulnerable to fire hazards, such as the young and the elderly.

The incident took place in the Rosh HaNikra (HaKira) locality kibbutz on the Lebanese-Israeli border. According to Lebanese authorities the soldier who shot and killed the IDF serviceman acted independently without orders to shoot. The shootout marked the first time an Israeli soldier died confronting Lebanese soldiers since the 2010 Israel‚ÄìLebanon border clash.  Incident  On 15 December 2013, at 8:30 pm, Israeli soldier Sergeant Shlomi Cohen, 31, was shot dead by rogue Lebanese army soldier Hassan Ibrahim, 27, a ten-year veteran of the Lebanese military. Ibrahim deserted his army post and shot dead the IDF soldier at close range with a light firearm. The bullets struck him and the military jeep he was driving in 6 to 7 times, between the Rosh HaNikra (known in Lebanon as Naqoura) border crossing and the IDF post he was coming from. The shooting occurred along the fenced Blue Line, 50 meters from the Lebanese border.

Description Corymbia zygophylla is a small tree or a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, tessellated to fibrous, pale to dark brown bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, heart-shaped, stem-clasping leaves that are long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. The leaves in the crown are juvenile leaves that are heart-shaped to lance-shaped, stem-clasping, the same shade of dull green on both sides, long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a thick, branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds that are sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum with a small point in the centre. Flowering occurs in December or January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped to shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming The Broome bloodwood was first formally described in 1934 by William Blakely who gave it the name Eucalyptus zygophylla and published the description in his book A Key to the Eucalypts from specimens collected near Broome in 1905 by William Vincent Fitzgerald. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia zygophylla. Distribution and habitat Corymbia zygophylla grows in shallow, red sandy soils on dunes and sandplains. It is mainly found in the southern Kimberley region but there are scattered populations in the Pilbara and Great Sandy Desert in the Carnarvon, Central Kimberley, Dampierland, Great Sandy Desert, Ord Victoria Plain and Pilbara biogeographic regions.

He went to the Prussian military school.  Biography  = Albanian revolt of 1910 = During the Albanian revolt of 1910, the Ottoman government replaced Cavid Pasha and sent Turgut along with 16,000 infantry, some cavalry and artillery to put down the revolt by Albanian rebels. Throughout his military campaign in Kosovo, Turgut imposed upon the population severe measures to disarm and control them. On 10 April Albanian deputies in the Ottoman Parliament expressed their concerns calling Turgut's actions a \\"barbarous advance\\", while a report referring to events in Albania was given to the Grand Vizier by some of the Albanian elite in Istanbul. In parliament the Ottoman government declined to give answers and stated that there was no need to send an investigating commission to Albania. As such Turgut was empowered and applied the \\"law on the bands\\" in Albania. After the disarmament of Kosovo, Turgut continued toward Shkod√´r and during the journey he fought Catholic Albanian Malisors (highlanders), in particular a battle against the forces of Mehmet Shpendi, the bajraktar (chieftain) of the Shala tribe. On 26 July Turgut reached Shkod√´r, gave an order for the population to hand over weapons and called for a census to be conducted with military conscription of young males aged 18-26. Turgut's measures were disliked by local inhabitants and he remained in the town until 22 August. Apart from the north-western and northern mountains, Ottoman armies led by Turgut controlled northern Albania. On 22 August 1910, Turgut left Shkod√´r for Selanik (modern Thessaloniki) after completing the military goals of the campaign that lasted five months. On his way traveling through Mirdita Turgut gave an order for his soldiers to take Dibre (modern Debar) and disarm its inhabitants. Assisted through an imperial fetva (decree), Turgut in central and southern Albania closed Albanian schools and Albanian language education underwent a setback. = Albanian revolt of 1911 = The Albanian revolt of 1911 developed in April and Turgut along with 8,000 soldiers came back to the region to deal with the situation. At Shkod√´r on 11 May 1911, Turgut made an official announcement and declared martial law with an offer of amnesty to rebels if they quickly went back to their homes. A pardon was not offered to Malisor chieftains and as leaders of the uprising they would need to stand trial through a court martial (Divani Harb). From Podgorica the Albanian chieftains replied to Turgut on 18 May 1911. Signed by 60 chieftains the message said that in 1910 they disarmed due to Turgut's promises of constitutional rights and those commitments were not kept as the Ottoman government closed Albanian schools, raised taxes, imprisoned people and committed other heavy-handed measures. The chieftains also accused the Ottoman government of provoking communal conflict between Muslim and Christian Albanians and stated that their return to as loyal subjects rested upon the constitution being upheld. Turgut announced an imperial decree that offered amnesty to inhabitants on 18 June 1911. The terms outlined that rebels come back within ten days to hand over their weapons and a personal gift of 10,000 liras would be granted by the sultan for compensation of damages. For destroyed or lost property of the Malisors the government would give restitution. Malisor chieftains and their families had taken refuge in Montenegro to avoid Turgut and were visited by Ismail Qemali. At a gathering of the Malisors and Qemali they wrote the Gre√ß√´ Memorandum calling for Albanian autonomy, ethno-linguistic rights and other measures. Signed by the Albanian delegates the memorandum also referred to the destruction done by Turgut in northern Albania and the document was a reply to the general's amnesty decree. Sultan Mehmed V signed an amnesty decree on 3 July 1911 and the rebels refused to come back due to their dislike of Turgut. The rebels held Turgut personally responsible and not the Ottoman government for what occurred in Albania. The Ottoman government recalled Turgut to Istanbul. Albanians were pleased with Turgut's departure viewing it as a humiliation for the general that had been decorated for his military campaign against the Albanian rebellion by the sultan and foreign ambassadors. Turgut was replaced by Abdullah Pasha.

Overview  Whenever a gas is forced through a tube, the gaseous molecules are deflected by the tube's walls. If the speed of the gas is much less than the speed of sound, the gas density will remain constant and the velocity of the flow will increase. However, as the speed of the flow approaches the speed of sound, compressibility effects on the gas are to be considered. The density of the gas becomes position dependent. While considering flow through a tube, if the flow is very gradually compressed (i.e. area decreases) and then gradually expanded (i.e. area increases), the flow conditions are restored (i.e. return to its initial position). So, such a process is a reversible process. According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, whenever there is a reversible and adiabatic flow, constant value of entropy is maintained. Engineers classify this type of flow as an isentropic flow of fluids. Isentropic is the combination of the Greek word \\"iso\\" (which means - same) and entropy. When the change in flow variables is small and gradual, isentropic flows occur. The generation of sound waves is an isentropic process. A supersonic flow that is turned while there is an increase in flow area is also isentropic. Since there is an increase in area, therefore we call this an isentropic expansion. If a supersonic flow is turned abruptly and the flow area decreases, the flow is irreversible due to the generation of shock waves. The isentropic relations are no longer valid and the flow is governed by the oblique or normal shock relations. Stagnation properties 391x391px In fluid dynamics, a stagnation point is a point in a flow field where the local velocity of the fluid is zero. The isentropic stagnation state is the state a flowing fluid would attain if it underwent a reversible adiabatic deceleration to zero velocity. There are both actual and the isentropic stagnation states for a typical gas or vapor. Sometimes it is advantageous to make a distinction between the actual and the isentropic stagnation states. The actual stagnation state is the state achieved after an actual deceleration to zero velocity (as at the nose of a body placed in a fluid stream), and there may be irreversibility associated with the deceleration process. Therefore, the term \\"stagnation property\\" is sometimes reserved for the properties associated with the actual state, and the term total property is used for the isentropic stagnation state. The enthalpy is the same for both the actual and isentropic stagnation states (assuming that the actual process is adiabatic). Therefore, for an ideal gas, the actual stagnation temperature is the same as the isentropic stagnation temperature. However, the actual stagnation pressure may be less than the isentropic stagnation pressure. For this reason the term \\"total pressure\\" (meaning isentropic stagnation pressure) has particular meaning compared to the actual stagnation pressure. Flow analysis The isentropic efficiency is \\\\frac{h_1-h_{2a}}{h_1-h_2}. The variation of fluid density for compressible flows requires attention to density and other fluid property relationships. The fluid equation of state, often unimportant for incompressible flows, is vital in the analysis of compressible flows. Also, temperature variations for compressible flows are usually significant and thus the energy equation is important. Curious phenomena can occur with compressible flows. * For simplicity, the gas is assumed to be an ideal gas. * The gas flow is isentropic. * The gas flow is constant. * The gas flow is along a straight line from gas inlet to exhaust gas exit. * The gas flow behavior is compressible. There are numerous applications where a steady, uniform, isentropic flow is a good approximation to the flow in conduits. These include the flow through a jet engine, through the nozzle of a rocket, from a broken gas line, and past the blades of a turbine. Mach number = M Velocity = V Universal gas constant = R Pressure = p Specific heat ratio = k Temperature = T * = Sonic conditions Density = \\\\rho Area = A Energy equation for the steady flow: q_{net} + h + \\\\frac{\\\\vec{V}^2}{2} = w_{net} + h_o + \\\\frac{\\\\vec{V}_o^2}{2} To model such situations, consider the control volume in the changing area of the conduit of Fig. The continuity equation between two sections an infinitesimal distance dx apart is \\\\rho AV = (\\\\rho + d\\\\rho)(A+dA)(V +dV) If only the first-order terms in a differential quantity are retained, continuity takes the form \\\\frac{dV}{V} + \\\\frac{dA}{A} + \\\\frac{d\\\\rho}{\\\\rho} = 0 The energy equation is: \\\\frac{V^2}{2} + \\\\frac{k}{k-1}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} = \\\\frac{\\\\left(V+dV\\\\right)^2}{2} + \\\\frac{k}{k-1}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{p+dp}{\\\\rho + d\\\\rho} 372x372px This simplifies to, neglecting higher-order terms,: VdV + \\\\frac{k}{k-1}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\rho dp - pd\\\\rho}{\\\\rho^2} = 0 Assuming an isentropic flow, the energy equation becomes: VdV + \\\\frac{k\\\\cdot p}{\\\\rho^2}\\\\cdot d\\\\rho = 0 Substitute from the continuity equation to obtain \\\\frac{dV}{V}\\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\rho V^2}{k p} - 1\\\\right) = \\\\frac{dA}{A} or, in terms of the Mach number: \\\\frac{dV}{V}\\\\cdot \\\\left(M^2-1\\\\right) = \\\\frac{dA}{A} This equation applies to a steady, uniform, isentropic flow. There are several observations that can be made from an analysis of Eq. (9.26). They are: * For a subsonic flow in an expanding conduit (M <1 and dA>0), the flow is decelerating (dV <0). * For a subsonic flow in a converging conduit (M <1 and dA <0), the flow is accelerating (dV >0). * For a supersonic flow in an expanding conduit (M >1 and dA >0), the flow is accelerating (dV >0). * For a supersonic flow in a converging conduit (M >1 and dA <0), the flow is decelerating (dV <0). * At a throat where dA =0, either M =1 or dV =0 (the flow could be accelerating through M =1, or it may reach a velocity such that dV =0). = Supersonic flow = 384x384px A nozzle for a supersonic flow must increase in area in the flow direction, and a diffuser must decrease in area, opposite to a nozzle and diffuser for a subsonic flow. So, for a supersonic flow to develop from a reservoir where the velocity is zero, the subsonic flow must first accelerate through a converging area to a throat, followed by continued acceleration through an enlarging area. The nozzles on a rocket designed to place satellites in orbit are constructed using such converging-diverging geometry. The energy and continuity equations can take on particularly helpful forms for the steady, uniform, isentropic flow through the nozzle. Apply the energy equation with Q_ W_S 0 between the reservoir and some location in the nozzle to obtain c_p\\\\cdot T_o = \\\\frac{V^2}{2} + c_p\\\\cdot T Any quantity with a zero subscript refers to a stagnation point where the velocity is zero, such as in the reservoir. Using several thermodynamic relations equations can be put in the forms: \\\\frac{T_o}{T} = 1 + \\\\frac{k-1}{2}M^2 \\\\frac{p_o}{p} = \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{k-1}{2}M^2 \\\\right)^\\\\left(\\\\frac{k}{k-1}\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\rho_o}{\\\\rho} = \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{k-1}{2}M^2 \\\\right)^\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{k-1}\\\\right) If the above equations are applied at the throat (the critical area signified by an Asterisk (*) superscript, where M =1), the energy equation takes the forms \\\\frac{T^*}{T_o} = \\\\frac{2}{k+1} \\\\frac{p^*}{p_o} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{k+1}\\\\right)^\\\\left(\\\\frac{k}{k-1}\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\rho^*}{\\\\rho_o} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{k+1}\\\\right)^\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{k-1}\\\\right) The critical area is often referenced even though a throat does not exist. For air with k =1.4, the equations above provide T* = 0.833333¬∑To p* = 0.528282¬∑po œÅ* = 0.633938¬∑œÅo The mass flux through the nozzle is of interest and is given by: \\\\dot{m}= \\\\rho AV = \\\\frac{p}{RT}\\\\cdot A\\\\cdot M \\\\sqrt{kRT} = p \\\\sqrt{k \\\\over RT} AM With the use of Eq.

If the reservoir pressure is held constant and the receiver pressure reduced, the Mach number at the exit of the nozzle will increase until Me=1 is reached, indicated by the left curve in figure 2. After Me =1 is reached at the nozzle exit for p_r =0.5283p_0, the condition of choked flow occurs and the velocity throughout the nozzle cannot change with further decreases in p_r. This is due to the fact that pressure changes downstream of the exit cannot travel upstream to cause changes in the flow conditions. The right curve of Fig2. represents the case when the reservoir pressure is increased and the receiver pressure is held constant. When M_e=1, the condition of choked flow also occurs; but Eq indicates that the mass flux will continue to increase as p_0 is increased. This is the case when a gas line ruptures. Fig2: The pressure variation in the nozzle. It is interesting that the exit pressure p_e is able to be greater than the receiver pressure p_r. Nature allows this by providing the streamlines of a gas the ability to make a sudden change of direction at the exit and expand to a much greater area resulting in a reduction of the pressure from p_e to p_r. The case of a converging-diverging nozzle allows a supersonic flow to occur, providing the receiver pressure is sufficiently low. This is shown in Fig. 9.6 assuming a constant reservoir pressure with a decreasing receiver pressure. If the receiver pressure is equal to the reservoir pressure, no flow occurs, represented by curve A. If pr is slightly less than p_0, the flow is subsonic throughout, with a minimum pressure at the throat, represented by curve B. As the pressure is reduced still further, a pressure is reached that result in M =1 at the throat with subsonic flow throughout the remainder of the nozzle. There is another receiver pressure substantially below that of curve C that also results in isentropic flow throughout the nozzle, represented by curve D; after the throat the flow is supersonic. Pressures in the receiver in between those of curve C and curve D result in non-isentropic flow (a shock wave occurs in the flow) and will be considered in the next section. If pr is below that of curve D, the exit pressure pe is greater than pr. Once again, for receiver pressures below that of curve C, the mass flux remains constant since the conditions at the throat remain unchanged. It may appear that the supersonic flow will tend to separate from the nozzle, but just the opposite is true. A supersonic flow can turn very sharp angles, since nature provides expansion fans that do not exist in subsonic flows. To avoid separation in subsonic nozzles, the expansion angle should not exceed 10¬∞. For larger angles, vanes are used so that the angle between the vanes does not exceed 10¬∞.

The property is situated approximately north of Elliott and west of Borroloola. The property abuts both the Bullwaddy Conservation Reserve and Amungee Mungee Station to the west. Tanumbirini also shares a boundary with Nutwood Downs to the west, Beetaloo Station to the south, Broadmere to the east and the Alawa Aboriginal Land Trust to the north. The Carpentaria Highway passes through the property. It currently occupies an area of and is currently owned by the Thames Pastoral Company who acquired the property from Sterling Buntine in 2012 for 30 million. The sale of the station included approximately 28,000 head of cattle. Several watercourses flow through the property including Arnold River, Cox River, Tanumbirini Creek and Williams Creek. The station was established prior to 1908 when it was owned by Mr. Coop. In 2002 the property was acquired by Henry and Maria Townsend. The property had been suffering from overgrazing and the black soil plans were completely denuded of grass. At the time it was stocked with 10,000 cattle with an additional 2,000 to 3,000 feral cattle. The Townsends redeveloped the property and changed the management practices. They also managed to increase the stock on the property to 23,000 head of cattle before selling in 2007. Sterling Buntine, who also owned Bedford Downs Station in Western Australia and Amburla Station in the Northern Territory acquired Tanumbirini in 2007 for an undisclosed sum. At the time it had an area of and was to be subdivided and auctioned before Buntine bought it. Buntine sold the property in 2012 along with Forrest Hill Station to the Thames Pastoral Company for about 33 million. In 2020 the property was acquired by Rallen Australia owned by the Ravazzotti and Langenhoven families from South Africa. It was bought along with nearby Forrest Hill Station for 70 million. The properties have a combined area of and are able to support approximately 40,000 head of cattle.

Plot Police inspector Pierre Lau (Sammo Hung) and his young superior Tang Chuen-shek (Takeshi Kaneshiro) are ordered to cooperate with customs officer Rambo Wong (Yuen Biao) to foil a drug trade. During the operation, they arrest Nakamura, a major drug lord and seize the largest bulk of drugs since the start of Hong Kong. Japanese businessman Yamamoto (Kelvin Siu) is the mastermind of the Nakmura Organization. Due to the large amount of drugs being confiscated and with nothing left, Yamamoto desperately decides to order his underling Siu-lung (Collin Chou) to hire some thugs from America to help him snatch the drugs at the police station to destroy the evidence so Yamamoto would not face any charges and restore the collapse Nakamura Organization. On the other hand, Yau Ching (Kathy Chow) and Pierre are like-minded colleagues, while May (Annabelle Lau), who has a secret crush on Pieree, is not his cup of tea. At the same time, Rambo has admired Pierre's subordinate, Anna (Eileen Tung), after their first meet and often forces Pierre to be their matchmaker. In order to snatch the drugs from the police station, the thugs plant bombs in the station, forcing the officers to leave the building while they pose as SDU members and go snatch the drugs from the evidence room. However, they were penetrated by Shek and after battling alongside Pierre against the thugs, the thugs managed to escape after one of the thugs Sean (Shawn Patrick Berry) was arrested. After this, Yamamoto orders the thugs to leave Hong Kong, who refuse to do so since Bobby (Robert Samuels), Sean's older brother, refuses to leave without his brother. When Yamamoto's bodyguards attempt to kill them, the thugs managed to overpower them and kill them. The thugs then kidnap Ching and forces Pierre to free Ching, where he will get Ching and the drugs back in exchange for Sean. Pierre decides to take matters to his own hands and Rambo and Shek agrees to help him, while Yamamoto also decides to take back the drugs and kill the thugs. Pierre confronts the thugs with holding Rambo, who is dressed and painted to resemble Sean, hostage to exchange for Ching and the drugs while Shek, also dressed and painted to resemble Sean, takes another route to rescue Ching. But hell breaks loose no so long later and Yamamoto also arrives with Siu-lung and two white bodyguards. After several long battles, where Pierre defeats Bobby, who was later killed by Lung, Pierre kills Lung and Yamamoto, while Rambo kills the two bodyguards with help of two thugs Timmy (Timmy Hung) and Cheung (Jimmy Hung), who decide to turn straight and be witnesses, and Shek engages in a gunfight with the thugs and bodyguards. In the end, Pierre is reunited with Ching.

The name and taxonomy inconsistency has caused some concern for this fairly large, black and white, cold water seabird.  Description  The adult Antarctic shag is about 75‚Äì77 cm tall, has a wingspan of 124 cm, and weighs 1.5-3.5 kg. When looking at individuals within this species, the most defining characteristic is the warty yellow caruncle found on the forehead. Additionally, the blue eye, which is actually blue skin surrounding the eye, is a distinct trait that stands out about these birds. The head, wings, and outside of the thighs are black. While the underparts and central back are white. White is also found on the wing bars that line the upper wing. The bill is dark ranging from brown to yellow. As the bill hooks, the lower mandible becomes lighter. The species has naked pink webbed feet and large black claws. The wings of this species are extremely strong and are powerful in flight with continuous wingbeats disrupted by some gliding. It is estimated that flight speed can reach 50 km per hour. Juveniles are more dull and brown when compared to adults. They don't usually have the warty caruncle or white patch patch on the back. Males and female look very similar but can be distinguished by size. Specifically, males are larger than females in size and are also larger-billed.  Taxonomy  The Antarctic shag is part of the order Suliformes and the family Phalacrocoracidae, which includes all cormorants and shags. Still, there is some taxonomy issues regarding how or where to place this species. More specifically, the Antarctic shag is sometimes placed in genus Phalacrocorax or Leucocarbo. This species is often considered part of the \\"blue-eyed\\" complex. Sometimes scientist lump the Antarctic shag with other species, such as the imperial shag.  Habitat and Distribution  Currently, the Antarctic shag is found on the Antarctic Peninsula, South Shetland Islands, and Elephant Island. The Antarctic shag is described as a marine species staying near the shores of coastal regions and some islands. Additionally, colonies are usually found near packed ice. During the breeding season, breeding colonies are found on cliffs, rocky slopes, outcrops and sometimes even flat coasts or islets. This species is sedentary and doesn't migration no matter the time of the year. Colonies many move short distances to find waters that aren't frozen in order to dive and feed. This short move most likely occurs in the winter months when ice starts to spread and cover the ocean where the birds feed. = Population Status = The current population of the Antarctic shag is stable, with a estimated 20,000 individuals worldwide. Currently there is no particular threat that could hurt the community or population size. It is very hard to estimate the population of species in isolated areas, such as the Antarctic. Still, recent studies using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have allowed scientist estimate Antarctic shag populations by taking images of colonies. Since this data is based on images, information can also be used to learn more about topography, habitat selection and nesting. In the future, this might allow scientist to further precisely estimate population size.  Behavior  = Reproduction = Antarctic shags are monogamous meaning they will only mate with one partner each nesting season. Still, from year to year, partners may change. In order to attract a partner, males show a greeting display. Typically, colonies will breed on low rocky cliffs near the water. Sometimes, breeding groups are shared with other bird species such as the rock shag, southern rockhopper penguin, and black-browed albatrosses. This species is known for smaller colonies, usually with 20-40 pairs. Still some larger colonies, up to 800 pairs, have been observed. Both genders help create a nest made from feathers, seaweed, and ocean debris. Materials are then connected with excreta, which is defined as waste material, such as feces and urine. Many times, shag couples will steal nesting material from other couples. By the time the nest is fully constructed, the shape resembles that of a cone with the tip cut off, similar to a volcano. Nests are sometimes reused from year to year since many individuals stay in the say colony and will return to the same breeding site. Antarctic shags lay their eggs between October and December. Typically the female will lay 2 or 3 eggs on average; but up to 5 eggs has been observed. Both parents help incubated the eggs for 28‚Äì21 days. Chicks are hatched without a protective down making them even more vulnerable to the Antarctic conditions. Due to this lack of temperature protection, parents are required to keep their chicks warm for the first few weeks. The naked chicks are fed by their parents for about 3 weeks with the male partner providing most of the food. After about 3 weeks of being fed by their parents, the chicks start to fledge. By age 4, the offspring have reached sexual maturity. Amazingly, its estimated that blue-eyed shags can live for 15 to 20 years in the wild. It's important to note that breeding success can be directly affected by food availability and diving conditions. = Diet = The most common way to understand Antarctic stag diet is by analyzing pellets. Bird pellets are regurgitated material that a individual is unable to digest. Many times, pellets are composed of bones, fur and even feathers. Antarctic shags usually forage in groups but sometimes alone. Most of the Antarctic shag's diet is composed of fish, but can also include crustaceans, octopuses, snails, worms, slugs and other invertebrates. The fish diet is composed of mostly humphead notothen, gaudy notothen, bullhead notothen, and Antarctic spiny plunderfish. Typically, the females consume more invertebrates while the males consume more fish. This diet difference is most likely due to the difference in sizes of each gender. = Role in the Food Web = Antarctic shags are rarely prey for other species. There has been a few documented cases, include a leopard seal and brown skuas killing an Antarctic shag. However, It is more likely that other bird species feed on eggs and chicks rather than adults. Unlike other birds, the Antarctic shag consumes demersal fish. In fact, this species can reach extreme depths when diving for their food. Since demersal fish are found on the ocean floor, these fish feed on other benthic species. Thus, the Antarctic shag links the benthic and pelagic zones of the food web. Despite linking these two areas of the ocean, the Antarctic shag has a limited population. Therefore, the amount of demersal species consumed doesn't impact the entire ecosystem. In other words, even though this species connect two different parts of the ocean by consuming fish near the bottom of the ocean, the limited population size of the shag, and respective limited amount of fish consumed, doesn't impact the ecosystem as a whole. = Diving = The Antarctic shag dives 25 meters on average to feed on fish. Strikingly, it is estimate that the maximum dive depth is around 60 meters. The number of dives and depth of each dive is related to foraging conditions. Based on observations, it's most likely that smaller fish and invertebrates are ingested while underwater. In contrast, larger fish, 15 cm or longer, are brought to land to eat. Shags can't predict how much time is required to dive and capture prey. It is most likely once underwater, the bird will look for prey, and react based on the situation. If a fish is found but the shag doesn't have enough oxygen, it will come back up to the surface, take in the largest amount of air possible, and dive again to capture the prey. This shows that the Antarctic shag changes its diving strategy based on the situation. Many birds can't fly with wet feathers and diving in the water can cause feathers to become waterlogged (fully saturated). Often, you see waterbirds standing with their wings spread to dry off their feathers after diving. Antarctic shags are uniquely different from these other water birds; due to the dense inner plumage, this species doesn't need to dry off via wing- spreading like other diving bird species. At the same time, dense feathers close to the skin prevent icy waters from hitting the skin. Additionally, birds having to spread wing to dry could further reduce their body temperature in an already extremely harsh climate. Therefore, both the cold water and cold air could have cause this species to develop this habit overtime. = Vocalization = Shags are known to be quiet but often vocalize at breeding sites or when vulnerable. When threatened, the male makes a \\"aaark\\" call while the female will make a hissing call. In contrast, during breeding, males makes a \\"honk\\" call.

Thompson's extensive research into coastal soils was influential in establishing Fraser Island as a World Heritage Site and in the development and management of the Cooloola National Park, Queensland. In 2004, he was awarded an Order of Australia in recognition of his contribution to soil science as a researcher and educator, and as an advisor in land management practices and conservation issues.  Early life and education  Born in the Central Queensland town of Rockhampton, Thompson grew up on a fruit and dairy farm in Ambrose near Mount Larcom, Queensland, attending the local public school. In 1940, he won a scholarship to Gatton Agricultural College, completing a diploma of horticulture in 1944 and remaining at the college to teach horticulture until 1946.  Career and later life  In 1946, Thompson joined CSIRO, where he worked various projects in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, before settling back at the Queensland Plant and Soils laboratory located in St. Lucia, Brisbane. There, Thompson met his wife, Betty Kennedy, who was a senior typist with the CSIRO. They married on the 15 April 1950. In the latter part of Thompson's career, he worked predominantly for the CSIRO Division of Soils and later the Division of Water Research. He worked extensively around Australia in soil mapping, mine rehabilitation, and interpreting soils in land-use surveys. Thompson's work on podzol development and the multidisciplinary research on the dunes at Cooloola, Queensland, are internationally recognised. After retirement, Thompson continued his coastal soils research with CSIRO and was influential in establishing Fraser Island as a World Heritage Site and in the development and management of the Cooloola National Park. Following his retirement, Thompson was an active and valued Honorary Fellow within CSIRO Tropical Agriculture and CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems.  Honours  Thompson's contribution to soil science and the sustainable management of soil systems was recognised with the award of an Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday Honors List, 14 June 2004 at Government House, Brisbane. On 4 April 2007, the then-Environment Minister Lindy Nelson-Carr for the Queensland government announced a scholarship program to support scientific research related to the Fraser Island World Heritage Area in honour of Thompson's work. The Cliff Thompson Memorial Scholarship program awarded $10,000 a year to a postgraduate project for one to five years duration and was offered through the Queensland EPA.

The film had its world debut on September 19, 2013 at the Austin Fantastic Fest and stars Emily Baldoni as a woman who must deal with strange occurrences following the close passing of a comet. Plot Eight friends reunite at a dinner party one night in California when a comet passes. Kevin asks Emily if she wants to come with him on his business trip to Vietnam, and she doesn't say yes. Kevin's ex- girlfriend Laurie is also at the dinner, and she wants him back. A power outage occurs. The hosts have some glow sticks that they use for light, and they decide to use the blue glow sticks. Everyone goes outside and sees one house up the street that still has power. When they go back inside, a glass is broken, which they didn't notice before. Hugh and Amir go to the other house to ask to use their phone, and a few minutes later they come back with a box. Inside they find a ping-pong paddle and pictures of themselves, including one that was taken that night, with numbers written on the back. On a notepad, Emily writes down the numbers from the box, looking for a pattern, but they can't find one. Hugh says that at the other house he saw a dinner party set for eight people. The friends realize the other house is an alternate of theirs. They begin to write a note for the other house, only to find the same note already on their own door. Emily, Kevin, Mike, and Laurie decide to go to the other house to see what's happening. While there, they encounter what appear to be copies of themselves carrying red glow sticks, and both groups flee back to their own homes. Emily's group explains to the others that they met copies of themselves, except the copies were wearing red glow sticks instead of their blue glow sticks. Hugh goes to his car and gets notes from a physics lecture. After reading those notes, they deduce that the comet has created a split reality, and that one of the realities will collapse when the comet passes. The group argues about how to deal with the other house. Beth is wrongly accused of lacing the food with some ketamine she brought, and Mike hysterically plots to kill their doubles before the doubles can kill them. They consider stealing the physics notes from the other Hugh's car. Mike goes to blackmail the other house's Mike, to prevent them from getting the lecture notes. It's revealed that Hugh and Amir are from the house with red glow sticks. They take the box and go back to the other house, then the Hugh and Amir with blue glow sticks return. They explain that they found two notes at the other house too. They realize that there are more than just two realities, and they switch from one house to another when they go outside and walk through a dark area. Outside, they hear someone smash Hugh's car window, and they go out to investigate. While outside, Emily has a sweet conversation with her husband, before realizing she's talking to a Kevin from a different reality, then she goes back inside. The group decides to put a random marker in front of their house. As the marker, they leave a random object and photos of themselves in a box, and on the back they write down the numbers they get from rolling dice. They check how their new numbers compare to the numbers from the other house's box, which they wrote on the notepad earlier. Emily realizes that the numbers written on this notepad aren't the same numbers she wrote on the notepad earlier. When she asks other people, she finds that Lee and Beth are the only ones whose memory matches what's written on the notepad, because they're the only ones who haven't left the house since they wrote the numbers on the notepad. Kevin and Laurie are the only ones whose memory matches Emily's memory, since they're the only ones who have traveled with her the whole time. Hugh and Amir remember a third set of numbers, since they switched realities when they switched to the red glow stick house and again when they switched to the current house. Mike remembers a fourth set of numbers, since he switched realities when he went to blackmail himself. The situation deteriorates further when a blackmail note arrives. Mike mentions that if there's a dark version of their group, maybe it's them. Another Mike arrives to try to kill them, scaring Laurie, who is comforted by Kevin. Emily leaves the house, and looks through several different houses, finding several where things are even worse. Finally, she finds a reality where no one seems aware of the split and there is a happy Emily. In this reality, Emily had agreed to go to Vietnam with Kevin at the beginning of the evening, and their relationship had stayed strong. She plans to replace this reality's Emily. She destroys a car window to lure the group outside, then ambushes her double with ketamine. Her double is able to crawl back inside, forcing Emily to subdue her again in a bathtub. She then heads to the living room and faints. She wakes the next morning unable to find her double, yet everything seems fine. She searches outside and runs into Kevin. His cell phone now rings, to which he answers \\"That's weird. It's you calling me.\\" Upon taking the call, he glances at her suspiciously.

He chose to shoot in his own home and developed the film's science fiction aspect out of necessity, as he wanted to \\"make a living room feel bigger than just a living room\\". While Byrkit did have a specific idea for how the film would unfold, he selected improvisational actors and gave them the basic outline of their characters, motivations, and major plot points. Byrkit told an interviewer, \\"For about a year, all I did was make charts and maps and drew diagrams of houses, arrows pointing where everyone was going, trying to keep track of different iterations. Months and months of tracking fractured realities, looking up what actual scientists believe about the nature of reality ‚Äî Schr√∂dinger's cat and all that. It was research, but despite all the graphs and charts, I think our whole idea was that it has to be character-based. We want the logic of our internal rules to be sound, and we wanted it to be something people could watch 12 times and still discover a new layer.\\" The movie cuts to black at 0:02, 0:03, 0:05, 0:05, 0:07, 0:09, 0:19, 0:27, 0:32, 0:34, 1:06, 1:18, 1:22, and 1:23. The movie's director has said those cuts signify something, but hasn't said what they signify. There was no cut to black around 0:16, which was the point of divergence between realities, although the house was plunged into darkness due to an electricity cut. There was no cut to black at 0:17, when the characters all switched from a house without a broken glass to a house with a broken glass, and there was no cut to black at 0:46, when only Mike switched to a different reality. =Casting= Byrkit intentionally chose actors who did not know each other. He told an interviewer that, after working on blockbuster films (such as Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl), \\"I come from theater where I was trained to really just concentrate on story and character on a stage with actors and so I was craving getting rid of everything, getting rid of the crew; getting rid of script, no special effects, no support, no money, no nothing, and just getting back to the purity of that, of a camera in your hand and some actress (actors?) that you trust and an idea.\\" Byrkit added, When asked whether the actors were people whom Byrkit knew pretty well, he answered, \\"Yeah exactly. They were just friends that I knew I could just call up and say, 'Show up at my house in a couple days. I can't really tell you what we're doing, trust me I'm not going to kill you. It should be fun!' And they didn't know each other before they got to my house and so I had to pick people that seemed to be like they could be couples, seemed like they could be best friends and that I just knew were up to the task of jumping into it.\\" Interviewer Nell Minow confessed her reaction to the actors' relationships: \\"I just assumed that they all knew each other very well because they fell into the kinds of rhythms that old friends have.\\" Byrkit replied, \\"That's just casting great people that could do that. Just five minutes after they arrived at my house they had to pretend to be married and lovers and best friends.\\" Reviewer Matt Prigge praised the choice of casting and their actions: \\"Byrkit ... focuses not on brainiacs, as in Primer, but on smart but mostly under-informed NPR types, who know enough to slowly piece all this together but not enough that they don't usually descend into blabbering, shouting and drinking. Indeed, Coherence is largely improvised, with a game cast first believably under-reacting to some weird business with laughter and disbelief, then always maintaining a degree of levity (read: jokes and occasional put-downs) even when stuff has gotten real.\\" =Writing= Ryan Lattanzio wrote, \\"Byrkit brought eight unwitting actors to his Santa Monica home, threw them a few red herrings and set them loose for five days knowing that the film could evolve organically, like great jazz, if he kept his players in the dark. But he and co-storywriter Alex Manugian weren't just making it up as they went along.\\" Byrkit told him that his desire was \\"to strip down a film set to the bare minimum: getting rid of the script, getting rid of the crew.\\" Byrkit added, \\"...instead of a script I had my own 12-page treatment that I spent about a year working on. It outlined all of the twists, and reveals, and character arcs and pieces of the puzzle that needed to happen scene-by-scene. But each day, instead of getting a script, the actors would get a page of notes for their individual character, whether it was a backstory or information about their motivations. They would come prepared for their character only. They had no idea what the other characters received, so each night there were completely real reactions, and surprises and responses. This was all in the pursuit of naturalistic performances. The goal was to get them listening to each other, and engaged in the mystery of it all.\\" Nicholas Brendon, an actor in the film, discussed the improvisational style of the dialogue with Mandatory journalist Fred Topel, who asked: \\"I understand the way Coherence was done was that everyone got notecards about their characters and the scenes. What was on your notecards?\\" Brendon replied, \\"I can't remember now, but every day we had five different things that we had to convey... but I do know that Jim [Byrkit], and then Alex [Manugian], the other writer, had to make sure that we were all on point. So it was just a matter of getting that information out. ... Since there was no script, I had no idea how it ended. ... When I saw the movie, I'm like, 'Oh shit, this is awesome!' ... To be quite honest with you, I never really knew what was going on fully until I saw the movie done.\\" =Filming= Principal photography took place over the course of five nights in Byrkit's house. An interviewer asked Byrkit, \\"Did you run into any unexpected problems in filming?\\" Byrkit admitted, \\"... you're constantly dealing with unexpected things. One night we tried to shoot outside and we had to make the whole thing look completely desolate and the power being off; that was the one night that we had another movie shooting on our street. So the whole street is completely ablaze with lights and hundreds of extras.\\" Another team was shooting a Snickers commercial. \\"We would be right in the middle of the dramatic scenes and there would be another knock on the door that would just scare the hell out of everybody...\\" = Music = The original score was composed by Kristin √òhrn Dyrud. The song in the closing credits is \\"Galaxies\\", from the album Year of Meteors by Laura Veirs. Inspirations and themes Byrkit told an interviewer for Spinning Platters, \\"Well, we came up with the premise in my living room, where the movie is shot. A couple years ago we were trying to think about what a good low budget, or no budget, movie would be. And, since we didn't have any resources, I had to think of what we actually had. We had a camera. We had some actors who were pretty good, and we had a living room. So we had to find out how to make a living room feel like more than just a living room. And, that led to a whole Twilight Zone type story... I was craving a more naturalistic type of dialogue, where people overlap and it's very messy, where people talk more like real humans talk. And so, we planned the story for a year, including the twists and turns and reversals and betrayals so that we had a really tight puzzle ‚Äì almost like a fun house that we knew we could lead the actors through.\\" Some reviewers have suggested that Byrkit was influenced by the eeriness of The Twilight Zone and/or the mind-challenging complexities of the science fiction film Primer. Byrkit answered one interviewer: \\"Twilight Zone, for sure. Primer wasn't really an influence so much as it was a sign to us that maybe there was an audience for this kind of movie. The actual movie itself is so different than ours that it wasn't as much of an influence as, say, Carnage by Roman Polanski, or other non-sci-fi movies.\\" Reception Critical reception for Coherence was predominantly positive and the film currently holds a rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 82 reviews. Much of the film's praise centered upon its cast, which Bloody Disgusting and Fangoria cited as a highlight. Film School Rejects gave Coherence a positive review, stating that the film's cast was \\"remarkably grounded for how complicated and bizarre the story is.\\" Dread Central commented on the film's themes and wrote, \\"What's frightening about the story is how willing the characters are to abandon the reality they know in favor of one that may be a little more appealing. Whether that's a byproduct of the comet and the rift it creates or caused by the characters undermining everyone else around them to get the life they really want is the fundamental idea of Coherence and what makes it so unsettling.\\" Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly praised the film, granting it a B+ rating: \\"In an impressive big-screen debut from James Ward Byrkit, eight friends discover metaphysics on their menu when a passing comet creates a set of doppelg√§ngers down the road, enjoying their own identical soiree. Byrkit makes the most of the claustrophobic one-house setting, ratcheting up the dread and paranoia as his characters make a string of seemingly reasonable but ultimately wrongheaded decisions. The star-free cast is great too, with Buffy the Vampire Slayer vet Nicholas Brendon poking fun at himself by playing an actor who used to be on a TV show... Coherence is a satisfying and chilling addition to the ever-growing pal-ocalypse subgenre. And really, you have to love a film that not only explains the concept of Schr√∂dinger's cat but also includes a joke about it (\\"I'm allergic!\\"). Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter also enjoyed the film: \\"An ingenious micro- budget science-fiction nerve-jangler which takes place entirely at a suburban dinner party, Coherence is a testament to the power of smart ideas and strong ensemble acting over expensive visual pyrotechnics... A group of eight friends gather for dinner... Marital tensions and sexual secrets sizzle just below the surface, but relationship drama is soon overshadowed by metaphysical weirdness when a comet passes close to Earth, shutting down power supplies and phone connections... It slowly becomes clear that the fabric of reality has been radically remixed by the comet's arrival. We are definitely not in Kansas any more... Byrkit only gave his cast limited information about the narrative loops and swerves ahead, encouraging a semi-improvised naturalism that feels authentically tense.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz, editor-in-chief of Roger Ebert's website, gives the movie three stars and writes that the film \\"is proof that inventive filmmakers can do a lot with a little... [but] none of the movie's technical or artistic shortcomings prove to be deal breakers. Once Coherence delves into its premise, the viewer is bound to come down with a bad case of the creeps. This is a less-is-more science fiction-horror tale... And it's genuinely more of a horror film than a suspense or \\"terror\\" film because, while there's some violence, the source of unease is philosophical.\\" Ryan Lattanzio of Indiewire praised the film's originality: \\"Coherence is not just smart science fiction: it's a triumph of crafty independent filmmaking, made with few resources and big ambition. Gotham-nominated debut director James Ward Byrkit stripped his vision down to the barest of bones to achieve a mind- shifting, metaphysical freakout about a dinner party gone cosmically awry. This film explodes with ideas, and it has that thing we always hope for at the movies: the element of surprise.\\" The reviewer for Salon was ambivalent: \\"After the fundamental problem of Coherence has become clear, or clear-ish ‚Äì there's another dinner party, at that other house, that looks an awful lot like this one ‚Äì the movie becomes slightly too much like an unfolding mathematical puzzle, although an ingenious one that reaches a chilling conclusion. Notes appear before they are written, the significance of those numbered photographs comes into focus through a series of neat twists, and while the characters are half aware that their actions are being shaped by a space-time continuum whose cause-and-effect relationship has gone awry, that's not enough to stop them.\\" =Accolades= * Next Wave Best Screenplay at the Austin Fantastic Fest (2013, won) * Maria Award for Best Screenplay at the Sitges Film Festival (2013, won) * Carnet Jove Jury Award for best In Competition at the Sitges Film Festival (2013, won) * Black Tulip Award for Best Feature Debut at the Imagine Film Festival (2014, won) * Imagine Movie Zone Award, Special Mention at the Imagine Film Festival (2014, won) See also * Many-minds interpretation * Many-worlds interpretation * Multiverse * \\"The Garden of Forking Paths\\", a 1941 short story by Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges References External links   Category:2013 films Category:2013 independent films Category:2010s science fiction thriller films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American science fiction thriller films Category:Comets in film Category:English-language films Category:Films about parallel universes Category:Films set in California Category:Improvised films Category:Time loop films Category:2013 directorial debut films ","title":"Coherence (film)"},{"id":"42997504","text":"Butyriboletus querciregius is a pored mushroom in the genus Butyriboletus.

It was collected with other Kipling stories in The Day's Work (1898).\\"The Ship that Found Herself The New Readers' Guide to the works of Rudyard Kipling, accessed 1 June 2014. The Dimbula, a cargo ship, makes her first voyage from Liverpool to New York. During the storm which the ship encounters, the various parts of the ship, each of which has a distinct personality, talk and argue with each other until, at the end of the voyage, they have learnt to co-operate effectively. Story summary Before the Dimbula leaves Liverpool, the owner's daughter, Miss Frazier, who named the ship when she was launched in Scotland, enthuses about the ship to the captain. He is more cautious, and says: \\"She has to find herself yet. It's the way wi' ships, Miss Frazier. She's all here, but the parrts of her have not learned to work together yet. They've had no chance.... We can no more than drive and steer her, and so forth; but if we have rough weather this trip - it's likely - she'll learn the rest by heart!\\" The ship encounters heavy seas during the voyage to New York, and the parts of the ship, being strained, complain about the conditions, and about the behaviour of neighbouring parts. The deck-beams, the stringers,It is explained in the story that \\"the stringers... are long iron girders that run lengthways from stern to bow\\". the garboard-strake,It is explained in the story that \\"the garboard-strake is the lowest plate in the bottom of a ship\\". the triple-expansion engine and other parts, have particular functions, and their characters are correspondingly distinct. Stringers \\"always consider themselves most important, because they are so long\\"; the garboard-strake says \\"I'm twice as thick as most of the others, so I ought to know something\\". The Steam, who \\"had been to sea many times before... he used to spend his leisure ashore in a cloud, or a gutter...\\" makes many comments on the conditions and the various complaints. As the Dimbula enter the Port of New York, the ship's parts stop talking and after a long silence there is a \\"new, big voice.... The Steam knew what had happened at once; for when a ship finds herself all the talking of the separate parts ceases and melts into one voice, which is the soul of the ship.\\" Commentary A commentator writes \\"From the standpoint of world history, two of Britain's most important activities in the nineteenth century were those of industrialism and imperialism, both of which had been neglected by literature prior to Kipling's advent.\\" In \\"stories like 'The Ship that Found Herself' and 'Bread upon the Waters' (The Day's Work)... he shows imaginative sympathy with the machines themselves as well as sympathy with the men who serve them.\\"General Preface Just So Stories for Little Children, by Rudyard Kipling, edited by Lisa Lewis.

Considered as one of Ukraine's top freestyle wrestlers in his decade, Tasoyev had claimed four career medals (two silver and two bronze) in the 96 and 97-kg division at the European Championships, picked up three bronze at the World Championships (2001, 2002, and 2007), and achieved top fifteen finishes in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Tasoyev trained as a member of the freestyle wrestling team for Olympik Kiev Sport Club, under his head coach Ruslan Savlokhov. Tasoyev made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's heavyweight division (97 kg). He lost his opening match to neighboring Russia's Sagid Murtazaliev, who later claimed the Olympic gold at the end of the tournament, without receiving a single point on the morning session, but wrestled his way to edge out U.S. wrestler and two-time Olympian Melvin Douglas with a 5‚Äì1 decision. Finishing second in the prelim pool and eleventh overall, Tasoyev's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals. Shortly after his first Games, Tasoyev emerged into the global scene with a blistering bronze medal effort in the men's 97-kg division at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, and then continued to deliver another one at the same tournament in Tehran, Iran by the following year. With two medals added to his career hardware, Tasoyev entered the 2003 World Wrestling Championships and came strong as a top medal contender. Though he finished eighth in the men's heavyweight division, he was officially selected to the Ukrainian Olympic team, and earned a ticket to his second Olympics. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Tasoyev qualified for his second Ukrainian squad, as a 29-year-old, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) by receiving a berth and placing eighth from the World Championships. In the prelim pool, Tasoyev eclipsed Switzerland's Rolf Scherrer with a 6‚Äì1 decision on his opening bout, but could not grapple Russian wrestler and defending European champion Khadzhimurat Gatsalov into the ring, as he had been beaten by his fresh opponent without collecting a single point. Tasoyev failed to advance further into the quarterfinals after finishing the pool in second place and fourteenth overall. Tasoyev moved up to the super heavyweight class from 96 kg after his second Games, and was determined to fight against his formidable opponents at the 2007 World Wrestling Championships, where he picked up his third career medal. He sought to compete for his third Olympic bid in Beijing, but decided to officially announced his retirement from wrestling for personal and political reasons.

It was invented by veena maestro Suvir Misra and is used in Indian classical music. Etymology and history The tradition of veena playing was becoming extinct in Hindustani music except for dhrupad, where the rudra veena was in use. The misr veena was created by Suvir Misra to re-introduce veenas to the Hindustani classical music concert scene. But molding a Saraswati veena into the Hindustani style was not an easy task. After years of experimentation, he came up a new veena, which is a hybrid of a Saraswati veena and a Rudra veena. He called it misr veena which means hybrid veena or mixed veena. A misr veena can be tuned to dhrupad, khayal and thumri. The specialty of the misr veena, according to Suvir Misra, is that the fast tanas of khayal comes out more beautifully through it. General Layout The bowl (tabli) of the misr veena is made of rosewood (tun) and its resonator (tomba) is made of gourd to reduce weight. The instrument has 20 movable bell metal frets and these helps in playing sudha and komal notes. There are seven steel strings, out of which five are playing strings and the remaining two are drone (chikari) strings. The number of sympathetic strings (tarab) is eleven, and helps to keep the strummer in tune while playing gamak. =Difference from Saraswati veenas and Rudra veenas= The bridge is open (khuli) in a Saraswati veena and has a slight curve to inculcate a nasal quality, while the Rudra veena's bridge is closed (band), so that a deep resonant sound can be gained. The misr veena has a medium bridge (jawari) to impart both a nasal and a deep resonance quality to the sound. Playing The misr veena is played with three fingers. Suvir Misra has developed a unique fingering method which helps in playing fast tanas using gamakas and meends.

Biography  Viren was a graduate of the Sea Cadets in 1877 and served as a midshipman on a clipper ship with the Baltic Fleet. In 1883, he was promoted to lieutenant and was awarded the Order of St. Stanislaus, 3rd degree. He graduated from the Mine Warfare School in 1884 and was awarded the Order of St. Anna 3rd degree in 1888. After graduating from the Nikolaev Maritime Academy in 1889, he served as a mine warfare officer on the battleship in 1891 and was promoted to lieutenant commander. He became captain, 2nd rank in 1894. He subsequently commanded a number of vessels with the Baltic Fleet, and was promoted to captain, 1st rank in 1901. In 1903 he was given command of the modern armored cruiser . At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Viren was commanding the Bayan as part of the Russian Pacific Squadron based at Port Arthur. During the Battle of Port Arthur he developed a reputation as a daring and capable commander. Following the death of Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft at the Battle of the Yellow Sea, Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky briefly took command of the Port Arthur Squadron, but could not command the support or respect of his peers. As no one officer could reach the besieged port, Viren, although a relatively junior officer with low seniority was promoted to rear admiral and on 4 September 1904 took command of the squadron during the last four months of the siege. During this time, with the besieged fleet unable to sortie and under continuous bombardment from land, Viren ordered that his warships be stripped of their guns, which were used to bolster the port's landward defenses, and his sailors were ordered to fight as naval infantry. He was wounded in combat in November 1904. After the surrender of Port Arthur, he was taken as a prisoner of war by the Japanese. After the war, he was awarded the Gold Sword for Bravery and the Order of St George, 4th degree, as well as the Order of St. Stanislaus, 1st class with swords. Viren was also appointed the head of artillery training for the Baltic Fleet in 1906‚Äì1907, and became commander of the Black Sea Fleet from 1907‚Äì1908. He was noted as a strict disciplinarian. He served on an Admiralty Board from 1908‚Äì1909. In 1909, he became the commandant of the port of Kronstadt and was promoted to vice admiral. After the start of World War I, Viren was promoted to admiral on 15 February 1915. In 1916, he was awarded the Order of St George, 3rd degree, for personal bravery in preventing the explosion of a powder magazine in the Petrovsky Fort at Kronstadt. However, after the start of March 1917 February Revolution, Viren was one of several senior officers bayoneted in Anchor Square, Kronstadt, by pro-Bolshevik sailors. Viren was buried in Lutheran (German) cemetery in Kronstadt. The exact location was lost, but in the 1990s a symbolic memorial stone was erected there in his memory.

However, it was always drawn to the genre of Opera. : In 1933 he created later became his most popular work is the children's Opera in his own libretto to the poems of Samuil Marshak \\"Fire\\", which for many years was sung on the radio and pleasing to the pre-war kids. His symphonic cantata on the motives of poems Musa Jalil performed in the Leningrad Philharmonic in the 1950s repeatedly. The public was not left without the favorable attention his cycle of romances on verses of Musa Jalil. : The main composer achievement of Joseph Pustylnik was the creation the first Chuvash Opera \\"Narspi\\" (\\"Runaway\\"), which he wrote in 1952 on the poem \\"Narspi\\" the K.

Lukin, conductor Century A. Kudashev, directed by I. Maximov-Koshkinskiy, artist P. D. Dmitriev, starring made soprano T. Chumakova). Unfortunately the great success of the Opera did not have, but went down in history of the Chuvash people as the first Opera of the life of simple Chuvashes. In 1958 in Moscow was executed and his Opera \\"the Seagull\\". = Scientific work = In his youth, in the years of study at the Odessa Conservatory, Joseph Pustylnik was fond of polyphonic music, and even in those years learned to freely write mirror Canon (one of the music polyphonic forms), which can be played on the right to left and Vice versa. : In his mature years he realized the full force of polyphonic thinking for composers and began a systematic study of creativity of the majority of composers that use polyphonic technology of writing, from Johann Sebastian Bach up to the creations of his contemporary Dmitry Shostakovich. As a result, in 1973, he created the fundamental work \\"The anthology of canon\\" M, 1973.

Charles Dartiquenave, also known as Charles Darteneuf (baptised 166419 October 1737) was an English epicure and courtier. Origins Dartiquenave was rumoured to be the illegitimate child of Charles II. biographers who have accepted the tradition of his royal paternity have suggested that his mother was a Frenchwoman. A more likely supposition is that he was the √©l√®ve of a refugee French family, whose name he assumed, Another theory is that he was related to John James Dartiquenave, who was buried at Fulham 25 September 1709. Epicure Dartiquenave was very fond of fine dining and convivial society, a bon-vivant. Jonathan Swift and Dartiquenave were friends, and frequently dined and drank with Henry St. John and Thomas Parnell, . ‚ÄòMy friend Dartineuf,‚Äô says Swift in his ‚ÄòJournal to Stella,‚Äô ‚Äòis the greatest punner of this town next myself,‚Äô and in another passage of the same journal Swift dubs his friend ‚Äòthe man that knows everything and that everybody knows; that knows where a knot of rabble are going on a holiday and when they were there last.‚Äô Alexander Pope in his imitations of Horace, ‚ÄòSatire I.,‚Äô allows to each mortal his pleasure, and asserts that none deny Scarsdale his bottle and Darty his ham-pie. In ‚ÄòSatires‚Äô (II. ii), Pope mentions ‚ÄòDarty‚Äô as a culinary judge. Lord Lyttelton, in his ‚ÄòDialogues of the Dead‚Äô (dialogue xix.), made Apicius and Dartiquenave represent the epicures of ancient and modern history. Samuel Johnson recorded (in 1776) that when this book came out Dodsley the publisher remarked to him, ‚ÄòI knew Dartineuf well, for I was once his footman.‚Äô Tradition has assigned to Dartiquenave some contributions to the ‚ÄòTatler,‚Äô e.g. a letter in No. 252, ‚ÄòOn the Pleasure of Modern Drinking.‚Äô Politics and public offices Dartiquenave was a strong supporter of the Whig Party who received employment though them. Among the treasury papers in the Record Office (vol. iii. No. 10) is a copy of an indenture in which Dartiquenave and another purchased ‚Äòthe office of keeper of Hampton Park, Bushey Park, and the Mansion House of Hampton Court during the lifetime of the Duchess of Cleveland‚Äô. Political patronage gave Dartiquenave from 1706 to 1726 the post of paymaster of the royal works, and his salary in 1709 was at the rate of 6s. 6d. a day, but in 1717 he pleaded for an addition of 200l. per annum, and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury sanctioned the increase from Michaelmas 1717 (Calendars of Treasury Papers, 1708‚Äì19). He was gazetted surveyor-general of the king's gardens in June 1726, and in March 1731 it was understood that he should be promoted to be surveyor of his majesty's private roads. However, that position went to someone else. Dartiquenave live, in the outquarters of St. James's Palace. He died on 19 October 1737 and was buried on 26 October in the church of Albury, Hertfordshire, where a slab in the church was placed to his memory. Family Dartiquenave was married to Mary Scroggs, daughter of John Scroggs of Albury parish. She was born in 1684 and became coheiress to the manor of Patmere in Albury. Scroggs died at Albury and was buried there on 31 August 1756. Dartiquenave's son was a captain in the guards, and his grandson sold the property in 1775. Publications A thin folio volume of twenty-three pages, containing his school exercises in Latin and Greek verse, was printed in 1681, with an address to Charles II and a dedication to Lord Halifax. Dartiquenave was at that time at school in Oxenden Street, Haymarket. Kit-Cat Club As an authority in social life and a friend to the Whig Party, Dartiquenave was a member of the Kit-Cat Club. His club portrait was painted by Godfrey Kneller, and engraved between Nos. 40 and 41, by John Faber Jr., in the collections of the Kit-Cat portraits published in 1735. The engraving was reproduced in the volume of ‚ÄòKit-Cat Club Portraits,‚Äô 1821, and a medallion print from it was prefixed to Nichols's edition of the ‚ÄòTatler,‚Äô vol. vi. Kneller's portrait of Dartiquenave is usually considered one of the best in the set, as showing strong individuality of character.

Family  Henry James was the second son (of five children) of John Augustus Richter and Mary Haig. John was originally from Dresden, Germany and was an artist, engraver, and scagliolist, well known for his works in imitation of marble. John Augustus Richter was a partner with Domenico Bartoli another scagliolist in London beginning in 1767 and continuing through the 1777 or 1778. Bartoli emigrated from the port city of Livorn, Italy (often referred to in English as Leghorn) and, after working for almost 10 years with Richter, moved on to Ireland.The Henry Moore Foundation One notable item the elder Richter produced was a child's building blocks set called Richter's Anchor Blocks (an example of which is currently in the collection of the UK National Trust Museum of Childhood.)UK National Trust Collection Henry's older brother, John Richter (1769?‚Äì1830), was a prominent radical politician, and member of the London Corresponding Society. He was later arrested for high treason and incarcerated briefly in the Tower of London. In 1794, the Richter brothers compiled and printed John Milton's book of poems called Paradise Lost which included 13 illustrations done by Henry James. The book was dedicated and presented to His Royal Highness George, Prince of Wales while John Richter was on trial for treason.Crawford, Joseph (2011). Raising Milton's Ghost John Milton and the sublime of terror in the early Romantic Period. Bloomsbury Academic. Chapter 2, \\"Milton‚Äôs Ghost\\", p. 34-35, via Bloomsbury Collections. bloomsburycollections.com. Another brother, Thomas Richter, was a director of the Phoenix Life Insurance Company and remained with them until nearly the mid century. He had a sister, Elizabeth Richter, who married Rev. James Stuart Freeman around July 1808. Richter was educated at Dr Barrow's school (Academy in Soho Square) and St Martin's Library School, London. Richter got his youth education at the Academy in Soho Square. Initially the school was located at 1 Soho Square then around 1726, schoolmaster M. Clare moved it to number 8 where it became known as the Soho Academy. After Claire's death in 1751, his partner, Rev. Cuthbert Barwis took over for a period of time; succeeded upon his death by his nephew John. By the time Richter had entered the school, Reverend Dr. William Barrow had already become schoolmaster and ran the school from 1785 through 1799. During that time it was called occasionally referred to as Dr. Barrows school. Reportedly the school taught mathematics, geography, French, drawing, dancing and fencing. It is believed that Richter attended there between the age of 13 and 18. In about 1787, he began instruction under the artist Thomas Stothard, with whom he remained a close friend. He also began an association with William Blake. In 1788 he produced his first illustrations (to Shakespeare's plays), and first exhibited paintings, showing two landscapes at the Royal Academy, where he exhibited for many years. He became a student of the Royal Academy Schools in 1790, and reportedly studied anatomy. Career Throughout the 1790s Richter worked mainly as an illustrator, demonstrating skills as both draftsman and engraver; projects included editions of Samuel Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison and Clarissa Harlowe (with others, both 1793), Samuel Johnson's Lives of the English Poets (with others, 1797), and J.-H. Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's Paul and Virginia (1799). For a period of time, Richter lived at #26 Newman St. in London. This Street was also known as \\"Artists Street\\" because in the two block section were approximately 40 painters, sculptors, engravers and other in the arts including such notable individuals as Robert Cromek at #64, Benjamin West at #14, Thomas Stothard at #28, James Ward at #6, Henry Thomson at #15, Ozias Humphry at #25, George Arnald at #36, James Heath at #42, Thomas Cheesman at #71 and John Phillip \\"Pope\\" Davis at #76. In 1809 Richter began to exhibit at the Associated Artists in Water Colours, Bond Street, becoming a member in 1810, and president in 1811‚Äì12. His most popular work at this stage was the genre subject A Brute of a Husband, though he also established himself as a literary painter, with depictions of such characters as Don Quixote and Falstaff, and became one of the few notable artists to paint historical subjects in watercolour. With the dissolution of the Associated Artists in Water Colours in 1812 he was elected a member of the Society of Painters in Oil and Water Colours, though he resigned his membership in December of the same year, and until 1820 was represented on its walls only as an exhibitor. (In that year the society returned to its original form as the Society of Painters in Water Colours.) Richter was a pioneer in painting from nature, in both practice and theory. In 1812 he painted the oil Christ Giving Sight to the Blind, in bright sunlight on the roof of his house in Newman Street.Christ Giving Sight to the Blind - Henry James Richter 1816 The work was purchased by the trustees of the British Institution for 500 guineas and later presented to the New Church, Greenwich, completed in 1825, where it was installed as an altarpiece. A second version, attempting to improve on its truth to nature, was exhibited four years later. An engraving of this was done in 1816 by John Young. Then, in 1817, he published the pamphlet Daylight: a recent discovery in the art of painting, with hints on the philosophy of the fine arts, and on that of the human mind, as first dissected by Immanuel Kant. His more general ideas, including his approach to colour and use of models of his compositions in clay or wax, influenced other painters, notably the miniature painter James Holmes. Daylight combined his artistic interests with his study of metaphysical philosophy. Richter also wrote the article Metaphysics in the Encyclopaedia Londonensis and a paper, German Transcendentalism (1855). In 1821 Richter was again elected to the Society of Painters in Water Colours, though his membership and the frequency of his exhibits varied through the decade. Between 1827 and 1828, John Sartain apprenticed under Richter. In 1823, the 14-year-old Sartain had sought become an experienced engraver under the indenture of John Swaine of the Merchant and Tailors Company. in 1828, Sartain continued his apprenticeship under Richter. By now he was an experienced engraver and Richter gave him his first attempt at \\"stipple on steel\\" or Mezzotint that was titled \\"Omphale\\". Around that time, Richter had painted The Tight Shoe and had requested that Sartain do the engraving. Sartain did so, then later did additional engravings after he went to the US. Richter had hoped that Sartain would also do the engraving for his painting, The Brute of a Husband, but their relationship had soured and Sartain left Richter's employ to go out on his own. Between 1829 and 1830, Sartain was self-employed in London before leaving for Philadelphia and becoming very well known and respected in the US. From 1829 until his death, Richter he was both a member and a frequent exhibitor of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. The subject's of his most ambitious paintings of this later phase were taken from Shakespeare. He was also known for drawings and engravings of characters of Sir Walter Scott.The University of Edinburgh image collection Controversial Work In 1829, Parliament passed the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 which allowed members of the Catholic Church to sit in the parliament. Just two months before, Sartain engraved Richter's anti-catholic print, The Tempest , involving characters from William Shakespeare‚Äôs play.

His work became highly popular through reproductive engravings and, from 1828, through the illustrations he produced for annuals such as the Forget-me-Not and Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook for 1833; the painting, The School in an Uproar, was reproduced in several variations and even printed on pocket handkerchiefs. He reportedly produced as many as 150 works in the form of drawings, engravings and paintings. Some examples of his work are in the British Museum and in private collections. The painting The Love Letter, currently in a private collection.The painting The Love Letter shows two characters taken from Sir Walter Scott's The Antiquary and was likely painted after 1828. A poem of the same name was written by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, who was noted for creating literary pieces based on drawings and paintings and well known in the UK during that period.Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook, London Fisher, Son and Co. 1833. Pages 58‚Äì59. The painting depicts Mrs Mailsetter in an admonishing pose and Jenny Caxon, the recipient of a love letter from her older beau, Lieutenant Richard Taffril, who was away at sea. An engraving by Charles Rolls of the painting and the poem were published side by side in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook for 1833 (London, UK Fisher Jackson). An engraving made of this painting also references the title as being \\"Maternal Solicitude\\" and an earlier reference in the Literary Souvenir for 1828 gives descriptions of the collection of Alaric Alexander Watts with an alternative title of \\"Maternal Advice\\".An engraving of Henry James Richter's painting, the Love Letter.1843 The Love Letter by Henry James Richter Rolls contributed by engraving a number of drawings and paintings done by Richter. It is believed that the painting may have been based on the drawing and subsequent engraving of a different view of the scene.

He had at least two sons and two daughters. On 8 April 1857, Henry James Richter died at his home at 101 Lisson Grove, London. He was 85. At the time of his death, he was translating a metaphysical work by J. S. Beck, a former student of Kant.

The film, based on the International Military Tribunal for the Far East of 1946‚Äì48, depicts Japanese prime minister Hideki Tojo (played by Masahiko Tsugawa) as a family man who fought to defend Japan and Asia from western colonialism but was ultimately hanged by a vengeful United States. Shot at a cost of ¬•1.5 billion and partially funded by a right-wing businessman, Pride was one of the highest-grossing Japanese films of 1998 and was nominated for two Japan Academy Prizes. Although the filmmakers intended the film to open dialogue on Japanese history, it was controversial in China, South Korea, and Japan owing to concerns of revisionism. Plot In 1941, Prime Minister of Japan Hideki Tojo orders an attack on the United States, drawing that country into World War II. Four years later, Japan surrenders, and a victorious United States and its allies begin to try Tojo and other members of the Japanese government for war crimes. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East is convened in 1946 and charges 28 individuals with Class-A war crimes. They are to be prosecuted by Joseph B. Keenan and tried in front of an international group of judges, including Justice Sir William Webb. All twenty-eight plead not guilty, and Tojo charges the Americans with hypocrisy for trying him despite acts such as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As the victors are the ones conducting the trials, Tojo and his co-defendants are unable to receive a fair trial, and some of the prosecutions' witnesses give false testimony. The verdict is ultimately delivered on 12 November 1948: Tojo, together with six of his co-defendants, is to be hanged for his role in the war. This sentence is carried out on 23 December 1948. Production Pride was directed by Shunya It≈ç and written by . This film was co-produced by Kanji Nakagawa and Masao Sato for Toei Company. Cinematography was handled by , with editing by Takeo Araki. Music for the film was composed by Michiru ≈åshima. The film cost ¬•1.5 billion (USD 11 million) to produce, thrice as much as usually spent by the company; much of this money was provided by the president of a construction company who was known to be well connected to the right wing. The film starred Masahiko Tsugawa as Hideki Tojo and Ayumi Ishida as his wife, . American actors Scott Wilson and Ronny Cox appeared as Prosecutor Keenan and Justice Webb, respectively. Indian actor Suresh Oberoi played Radhabinod Pal, the lone dissenting judge ‚Äì according to AllMovie's Jonathan Crow, the film's only non- Japanese hero. The film also featured Eiji Okuda, Naho Toda, Gitan ≈åtsuru, and Anupam Kher. Pride was not the first film to deal with the tribunal, also known as the \\"Tokyo Trial\\". A film by Masaki Kobayashi, titled Tokyo Trial, had been released in 1983. This film, based on US Department of Defense footage, had taken a similarly negative view of the trials and argued that the US had also committed war crimes during the 20th century. Themes Pride depiction of Tojo is highly positive. Rather than the \\"absolute monster\\" sometimes depicted in American films on him, he is depicted as a strong, highly nationalistic, leader who loves his family and wants only to rid Asia of colonial rule. By comparison, the prosecutor Keenan is portrayed as a noisy and ignorant, yet scheming man. This depiction is based on the argument that Japan's war-time actions were misunderstood, and that these actions were not intended as acts of aggression, but as acts of self-preservation. The historian Peter High notes that Pride is one in a line of Japanese works from the late 1990s, including the films Tower of Lilies and Wings of God, in which the Japanese are portrayed as victims of American vindictiveness and viciousness. This trend, possibly influenced by the economic downturn then in progress, was backed heavily by older Japanese businessmen. By this time, the Tokyo Trial had come to be seen as the source of a loss of Japanese identity and tradition. The academic wrote a book in 1996 which proclaimed the trial to be , and the businessman Maeno T≈çru blamed a \\"Tokyo Trial view of history\\" for the negative view of Japanese history and culture. Futamura quotes It≈ç as saying: Release and reception Pride premiered on 23 May 1998, in 140 theatres nationwide. It was a commercial success, selling the most tickets of any domestic production released in the first half of the year. Reviews of the film in Japan were generally positive, and included praise for the star's \\"feverish\\" acting (from the Asahi Shimbun) and the quality of the sets (from the Sankei Shimbun). Crow, however, gave the film two and a half stars out of five. At the 22nd Japan Academy Prize ceremony held in March 1999, Pride received two nominations, for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Tsugawa) and Best Art Direction (Akira Nait≈ç). It won neither, with Best Actor being taken by Akira Emoto for Dr. Akagi and Best Art Direction being won by Katsumi Nakazawa for his work in Begging for Love. In Japan, Pride was given a home release in VHS in December 1998. A Region 2 DVD followed in May 2011. Liberty International Entertainment and Cargo Films released a DVD edition of the film in North America on 25 November 2003; this version included subtitles and a picture gallery. Controversy and legacy International response to the film was highly critical owing to concerns of historical revisionism, and Crow suggests that China and Korea ‚Äì both of which had suffered under Japanese rule during World War II ‚Äì viewed the film as \\"deliberate provocation\\" in light of Japan's unwillingness to recognise its past human rights abuses. Complaints included that the film whitewashed Tojo's role in the war, or that it justified the actions taken by Japan. Response in Japan was more positive, with CBS News recording only a single protest, although similar concerns of revisionism were echoed. Sato, in an interview, stated that the film was meant to \\"kindle a more nuanced debate about Tojo\\" rather than the \\"black and white\\" depictions which were more common. Tojo's granddaughter, Yuko Iwanami, stated that the film \\"challenged the image of her grandfather as a villain\\" by presenting a truth which had been \\"erased\\" after the war. It≈ç, meanwhile, stated that he \\"wanted to show how Tojo fought with pride\\", standing and facing the tribunal on his own. It≈ç would not direct another feature-length film until Lost Crime ‚Äì Flash in 2010, a crime film which Mark Schilling of The Japan Times considered enough to release him from \\"director's jail\\" ‚Äì \\"the limbo in which film directors find themselves after a flop or two.\\" In 2006, the Chinese director Gao Qunshu released another film regarding the Tribunal. Titled The Tokyo Trial, it focused on the Chinese judge Mei Ju-ao (played by Damian Lau) and portrayed Tojo (Akira Hoshino) as a gruff and unrepentant man.

Located at metres above the city of Lourdes, it is recognizable by its big cross lit up at night.  Access  pic du Jer funicular The mountain is accessible by funicular which has been in operation since 1900. It transports passengers up to 950 m high, which follows a long route, on a slope varying from 27% (right at the beginning) to 56%. The route separates in two in the middle to enable the two trains to pass. It travels through two tunnels and over a viaduct, which can be seen from distance, such as from the route linking Lourdes to Argel√®s (Argel√®s-Lourdes direction). The lower station is accessible near the route (indicated by arrows from the southern Lourdes exit roundabout). One can also get to it by bus from the town-centre. The 15-minute-long journeys (1.20 m/s) are usually every 30 minutes. The wagons hold 80 passengers (40 seated). From March to September, the funicular operates from 9:30 to 18:30, while only operating afternoons during the rest of the year. At the higher station, there are several paths leading to the summit. There is a fast food and drink outlet near the station, with terraced benches and wonderful views of Lourdes, the mountain peaks and the surrounding area. The main path has a few sheltered benches. Near the summit, the quality of the paths reduces considerably, but one can reach the summit without any real difficulty for a fairly fit and agile person. From the observatory, situated on the peak, an exceptional panorama awaits the visitor: Lourdes, the Lavedan and Argel√®s-Gazost, Tarbes, Lannemezan, Pau and the whole central mountain range of the Pyrenees (with orientation board). However, the observatory is in an abandoned state, as is the rest of the equipment on the summit, but this does not take anything away from the quality of the panorama. The pic du Jer is also a hiking and climbing stead. The start of a downhill permanent mountain bike slope is at the foot of the station of arrival.

The word is a portmanteau of the words shrink and inflation. First usage of the term has been attributed to both Pippa Malmgren and Brian Domitrovic. Shrinkflation allows companies to increase their operating margin and profitability by reducing costs whilst maintaining sales volume. Consumer protection groups are critical of the practice.  Economic definition  Shrinkflation is a rise in the general price level of goods per unit of weight or volume, brought about by a reduction in the weight or size of the item sold. The price for one piece of the packaged product remains the same or could even be raised. This sometimes does not affect inflation measures such as the consumer price index or Retail Price Index, i.e. might not increase in the cost of a basket of retail goods and services, but many indicators of price levels and thus inflation are linked to units of volume or weight of products, so that shrinkflation also affects the statistically represented inflation figures. Consumer impact Consumer advocates are critical of shrinkflation because it has the effect of reducing product value by \\"stealth\\". The reduction in pack size is sufficiently small as not to be immediately obvious to regular consumers. An unchanged price means that consumers are not alerted to the higher unit price. The practice adversely affects consumers' ability to make informed buying choices. Consumers have been found to be deterred more by rises in prices than by reductions in pack sizes. Suppliers and retailers have been called upon to be upfront with customers. According to Ratula Chakraborty, a professor of business management, they should if necessary be legally obliged to notify shoppers when pack sizes have been reduced. Corporate bodies deflect attention from product shrinkage with \\"less is more\\" messaging, for example by claiming health benefits of smaller portions or environmental benefits of less packaging.

It comprises the two towns of Fishguard and Goodwick, with their neighbourhoods of Dyffryn, Harbour Village, Penyraber, Lower Town, and Stop-and-Call. Within the community are two railway stations and Goodwick Ferry Terminal, which is the terminus of the A40 London to Fishguard Trunk Road. Governance The Community has a council called Fishguard and Goodwick Town Council. Three wards elect a total of 14 council members: Goodwick (5), Fishguard North West (4) and Fishguard North East (5). The Council elects a Mayor on an annual basis from among the elected councillors. Topography The three wards take in three areas of habitation, each fronting onto a section Fishguard Bay, a sheltered bay on the north coast of Pembrokeshire, South Wales. The coastline of the bay is entirely within the community boundary. Much of the shoreline has substantial cliffs although the section between the two towns, known as the Parrog, has a wide beach and leads to an area of flat marshland, and the River Gwaun at Lower Town harbour flows from the wooded valley of Cwm Gwaun. Goodwick ward includes the town of Goodwick on the north-east corner of the bay and Harbour Village alongside the ferry terminal. The north-west side of the bay is dominated by the major Ferry terminal at which the railway and the A40 terminate and from which two ships a day sail to Rosslare Europort, Ireland. Inland from Goodwick are the two settlements of Stop-and Call and Dyfryn. Within the bay itself are two 1 km long breakwaters ensuring safe port moorings, and between the ferry terminal and the outer breakwater is the Fishguard Lifeboat Station. North of the outer breakwater the community boundary takes in the east coast of Strumble Head including the rocky headland of Pen Anglas. The Parrog is a stretch of seafront and beach facing Fishguard bay, including the 'Ocean Lab' visitor centre,Ocean Lab website. Projecting north-east from the Parrog is the inner breakwater, whilst on the inland side is Goodwick Moor Nature Reserve, of reed-bed and mire, home to otters and water voles, and managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales. Fishguard North West ward has no coastline, occupying the western part of the town of Fishguard south of the A487 and west of Wallis Street. The area includes the south-western half of the historic centre of Fishguard upper town, with significant areas of housing and the Ysgol Bro Gwaun senior school, for which major rebuilding plans were announced at the end of 2015. Fishguard North East ward includes the other half of the historic upper town core, and an area of 20th-century housing known as Penyraber, beside the cliffs of Saddle Point. It also includes the steep slopes of the Lower Town area and the quayside of the picturesque old harbour. The harbour and Lower Town were the location used by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor for the 1972 film of Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood. The ward also includes the headland east of the town, where the A487 Fishguard to Bangor Trunk Road runs north-east out of Fishguard with sharp bends and steep gradients as it climbs up to the cliff top near Castle Point. Protected sites Within Fishguard and Goodwick community there are a wide variety of protected sites from rocky cliffs and ancient monuments to listed buildings and three conservation areas. =Geology SSSI= The cliffs below Castle Point The cliffs either side of Fishguard Lower Town harbour are an SSSI notable for its geology. From Saddle Point on the western side, round to Castle Point on the eastern headland, the geology has legal protection because of its notable Ordovician Pillow Larva, in which the Llanvirn series is well demonstrated. Many of the rocks of Pembrokeshire have their origins some 460 million years ago in vast volcanic outpourings of ash and Tuff, and more rarely flows of larva, which, as here, cooled into a number of pillow formations. =National Park= Although the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park includes almost all of the coastline, it has three gaps, of which one is Fishguard and Goodwick. Most of the Community is excluded from National Park jurisdiction. Several lengths of the Community boundary are also the boundary to the National Park, both to east and west. Only two small areas of the Community are within the National Park, these being: the Castle point headland north of the A487 to the east; and the northwest end of the community along the Pen Anglas headland of Strumble Head. For these areas, the Park is the legal Planning Authority, unlike the rest of the Community, for which Pembrokeshire County Council has that responsibility. =Scheduled Monuments= Garn Wen Cromlechs Pen Rhiw Cromlech: a broad, low-lying cromlech in a field north of Pen-rhiw farm, Goodwick. Old fort, Castle Point, Fishguard There are three scheduled monuments in the community. Two chambered tomb sites are prehistoric, and the Old Castle is a post-medieval site:- *Garn Wen Burial Chambers; A line of four Chambered tombs forming a neolithic cemetery on the hillside above the ferry terminal at A nearby car park amongst the housing estate provides an access to the footpath that runs past them. *Pen-Rhiw Burial Chamber: A neolithic Cromlech with a large capstone in a grassy field north of Pen-rhiw farm, west of Goodrick at , (SM942390) *Castle Point Old Fort, , (SM961378) was built in 1780s amidst fears of Napoleonic invasion. It now has a selection of canons housed on the ramparts. =Listed buildings= Hermon Baptist Church, Fishguard Two buildings within the community are listed grade II*. *Plas Glyn- y-Mel is a country house (subsequently a hotel) built in 1797‚Äì1799 for Richard Fenton, a Pembrokeshire historian and poet. The house stands at the south end of Glyn-y-Mel Road in Lower Town. *Herman Baptist Church is the earliest known Welsh example of a wide arch breaking into an open pediment - a feature that came to dominate non-conformist chapel facades across Wales by the mid-19th century. This facade also features four Doric pillars over a central porch. The chapel was built in 1832, designed by either Daniel Evans or his father David Evans of Fishguard. The interior is also substantially from 1832, with three-sided gallery, wooden pillars and box-pews. The Chapel stands on the south side of High Street There are also 161 grade II listed buildings across the two towns, including shops, houses, Churches, inns and public buildings. The largest density of these is in Fishguard town centre, which has 112, particularly along the Market Square and Main Street, Hill Terrace, Tower Hill and Hamilton Street, with another heavy cluster along High Street and West Street. It includes several terraces on Park Street and Nottipass Street. The Lime kilns on The Slade and farm buildings at Maesgwynne are also listed. In Fishguard Lower Town there are a further 35 grade II buildings, mostly harbour-side cottages, clustered around Quay Street, Bridge Street, Newport Road and Glyn-y-mel Road. In Goodwick there are 14 listed buildings, particularly in the centre, including the Lifeboat memorial, Institute, two churches and several houses and cottages. =Conservation Areas= This community has 3 of Pembrokeshire's 24 Conservation areas. These afford a wide- area protection for the special character of an area, regulating the building construction and alterations within the protected area and influencing the landscaping of outdoor spaces.Links to the designating maps can be found at The three areas match closely to the three historic settlement cores, and to the clusterings of the listed buildings. All three conservation areas were first drawn up in 1976, had a revision in 1992 and an appraisal in 2016. Lower Town Fishguard Conservation Area: Lower Town is thought to be oldest of the three settlements, growing up around the old harbour. The 2016 conservation area appraisal affirms the maritime history and coastal landscape as key significant features, and the resulting narrow streets, quayside buildings, constrained building plots and separation from the rest of Fishguard give it the picturesque value that the conservation area management plan seeks to protect and enhance. The conservation area is and covers the quay and hillside to the north, along the Gwaun valley, and adjoins the Fishguard Conservation Area where the main road climbs up from lower to upper town Fishguard Conservation Area (upper town): The special characteristics identified in the 2016 appraisal included the dramatic coastal setting, the mix of buildings from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the marketplace with radial streets, historic shop fronts, narrow streets and alleyways and the extreme topography separating the upper and lower towns. The town had a medieval origin and Norman castle, but its prosperity increased as fishing and coastal trade increased through the 17th and 18th centuries. The sheltered harbour served both trading vessels and those travelling to Ireland, and allowed ancillary industries such as boatbuilding and rope-making to thrive, and the townscape retains many elements from that period of prosperity. of the historic core of the town and the former industrial area of The Slade, leading down to the shoreline, are included in the conservation area. Goodwick Conservation Area: Goodwick as a settlement saw its period of growth into a town later than Fishguard. Although a maritime history and coastal setting are noted as significant in defining its special character, it is the period of late 19th- and early-20th-century growth that defines the town's character. With the 1906 arrival of the railway, and the use of Goodwick Harbour for trans-Atlantic liners, Goodwick had a fashionable heyday in the Edwardian period, and the Victorian and Edwardian shops are identified as being key parts of Goodwick's character. The Conservation Area covers including the town centre and the residential streets on the hillside northwest of the railway and ferry terminal.

A Viscoelastic fluid that returns to its original shape after the applied stress is released. Everybody has witnessed a situation where a liquid is poured out of an orifice at a given height and speed, and it hits a solid surface. For example, ‚Äì dropping of honey onto a bread slice, or pouring shower gel onto one's hand. Honey is a purely viscous, Newtonian fluid: the jet thins continuously and coils regularly. Jets of non-Newtonian Viscoelastic fluids show a novel behaviour. A viscoelastic jet breaks up much more slowly than a Newtonian jet. Typically, it evolves into the so-called beads-on-string structure, where large drops are connected by thin threads. The jet widens at its base (reverse swell phenomenon) and folds back and forth on itself .The slow breakup process provides the viscoelastic jet sufficient time to exhibit some new phenomena, including drop migration, drop oscillation, drop merging and drop draining. These properties are a result of the interplay of non- Newtonian properties (viscoelasticity, shear-thinning) with gravitational, viscous, and inertial effects in the jets. Free surface continuous jets of viscoelastic fluids are relevant in many engineering applications involving blood, paints, adhesives or foodstuff and industrial processes like fiber spinning, bottle-filling, oil drilling etc. In many of these processes, an understanding of the instabilities a jet undergoes due to changes in fluid parameters like Reynolds number or Deborah number is essential from process engineering point of view. With the advent of microfluidics, an understanding of the jetting properties of non-Newtonian fluids becomes essential from micro- to macro length scales, and from low to high Reynolds numbers7‚Äì9. Like other fluids, When considering viscoelastic flows, the velocity, pressure and stress must satisfy the mass and momentum equation, supplemented with a constitutive equation involving the velocity and stress. The temporal evolution of a viscoelastic fluid thread depends on the relative magnitude of the viscous, inertial, and elastic stresses and the capillary pressure. To study the inertio-elasto-capillary balance for a jet, two dimensionless parameters are defined: the Ohnesorge number (O‚Ñé) : Oh=\\\\frac{\\\\eta_0}{\\\\sqrt[]{\\\\rho\\\\lambda R_0}} , which is the inverse of the Reynolds number based on a characteristic capillary velocity \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\eta_0} and, secondly, the intrinsic Deborah number De, : De = \\\\lambda \\\\sqrt[]{\\\\gamma\\\\rho R_0^3 } , defined as the ratio of the time scale for elastic stress relaxation, Œª, to the ‚ÄúRayleigh time scale‚Äù for inertio- capillary breakup of an inviscid jet, t_r=\\\\sqrt[]{\\\\rho R_0^3/\\\\gamma}. In these expressions, \\\\rho is the fluid density, \\\\eta_0 is the fluid zero shear viscosity, \\\\gamma is the surface tension, R_0 is the initial radius of the jet, and \\\\lambda is the relaxation time associated with the polymer solution.

In 1964, he changed his family name to Yakupoƒülu. Yakupoƒülu was born to Hacƒ± Halil Aƒüa and ≈ûefika Hanƒ±m in Saray neighborhood of K√ºtahya. His interest for painting started when he was a child, observing the picture books attentively. He was schooled in Dervi≈ü Pa≈üa Elementary School in 1927. During his education, he was exhibiting his paintings in the art galleries and also was successful at other lessons. Yakupoƒülu had read all the picture books and books about the art of drawing and painting at Vahid Pasha Public Library before he finished secondary school. In 1941, he found an opportunity to meet Prof. S√ºheyl √únver, who came to Vahid Pasha Public Library for his manuscript research. After the graduation from K√ºtahya High School, he passed the entrance exam of Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University without any necessity to interview. He studied in Feyhaman Duran's workshop at the Department of Paintings, upon the recommendation of S√ºheyl √únver and graduated from here (1941-1945). He learned Ottoman miniature, illumination, flute playing, musicology, from S√ºheyl √únver and Halil Dikmen. After returning to K√ºtahya, he participated in some museum studies besides the painting. Yakupoƒülu has approximately two thousands original paintings; half of them are about streets, recreation spots, old historical buildings and the people of K√ºtahya Province. He used the surname \\"√áalƒ±≈üel\\" before he changed it to \\"Yakupoƒülu\\". He donated his house, library and all the paintings to Dumlupƒ±nar University. Due to his many abilities and vast knowledge. he is also known as \\"the last Hezarfen\\" (\\"a thousand sciences\\" in Turkish), with reference to Hez√¢rfen Ahmed √áelebi. In 2006, Yakupoƒülu donated all his paintings to Dumlupƒ±nar University in his hometown. Currently, he lives in Izmir with his adoptive daughter Havva S√∂kmener. Recognition In 2010, he was honored with the \\"Distinguished Service Order of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey\\" ().

He won a bronze medal in the 97-kg division at the 2001 European Championships in Budapest, Hungary, and also achieved a seventh-place finish each in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Shemarov trained as a member of the freestyle wrestling team for Minsk Trade Union Sports Club, under his father and coach Nikolai Shemarov. Shemarov made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's heavyweight division (97 kg). He scored a set of two triumphs to defeat Canada's Dean Schmeichel and Slovak-born Australian wrestler Gabriel Szerda in the opening matches, but suffered a formidable 2‚Äì3 overtime defeat against Poland's three-time Olympian Marek Garmulewicz. Finishing second in the prelim pool and seventh overall, Shemarov's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Shemarov qualified for his second Belarusian squad, as a 29-year-old, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) by rounding out the top ten spot and receiving a berth from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States. Shemarov delivered a more powerful effort from his previous Games by thrashing Turkey's Fatih √áakƒ±roƒülu and Mongolia's T√ºvshint√∂riin Enkhtuyaa to secure a spot for the next round. Fighting against Russian wrestler and European champion Khadzhimurat Gatsalov in the quarterfinal match, Shemarov could not score a single point to push him off the mat, and instead, matched his final standing from Sydney in the process. Shortly after the Games, Shemarov officially retired from his sporting career, and became a personal coach for his younger brother Alexei, who later competed in the men's super heavyweight division at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

The term has particular emphasis in legal systems based on British law, such as in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth countries such as South Africa and Canada and Australia, and former British colonies such as the United States. The term has several closely related meanings: it is seen as a fundamental right guaranteeing liberty; it describes guidelines for how courts can be more transparent; and it sometimes identifies an ideal situation. In a courtroom, it means steps to promote transparency such as letting the public see and hear trials as they happen in real time, televising trials as they happen, videotaping proceedings for later viewing, publishing the content and documents of court files, providing transcripts of statements, making past decisions available for review in an easy-to-access format, publishing decisions, and giving reporters full access to files and participants so they can report what happens. The principle includes efforts to try to make what happens in the court understandable to the public and the press. In Canada, open justice is referred to as the open court principle. Background The principle of open justice has been traced to decisions made before the Magna Carta. The principle is viewed as an underlying or core principle in British law. It has a long history dating back hundreds of years, and it has been traced to decisions made before the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. Today the concept is so widely accepted that there is a general presumption that there should be judicial openness, such that openness is the rule, with secret or obscured proceedings being considered as exceptions needing to be justified. The rise of social media websites such as Facebook has opened new ways for court cases to be made public; for example, in Australia, courts have considered having websites with live videos as well as blogs by retired judges to \\"preserve the concepts of open justice\\" in the digital age. In recent years, when governments try to cope with thorny problems such as terrorism, there are concerns that the principle of open justice can be undermined relatively easily by national security concerns. There are concerns that if new secrecy guidelines harden into precedents, that it might be hard to restore the \\"centuries old system of open justice\\". Practical considerations =Benefits= Proponents of open justice assert numerous benefits. An overarching benefit is that it keeps courts behaving properly. Openness acts as a safeguard for the proper administration of justice. According to philosopher Jeremy Bentham, open justice is the \\"keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity.\\" Knowledge that court trials are regularly public encourages further attendance by the public. Further, openness can mean more accurate decisions during a trial; for example, the proceedings can spur a witness to come forth, or encourage others to submit new evidence or dispute publicized statements. Openness reduces the chance that the judgment is a mistake or that a case might have to be re-tried because of a subsequent sanction of contempt. Proponents argue that open justice benefits democracy in a general sense because citizens can see how particular laws affect particular people, and therefore citizens are in a better position to advise lawmakers about such laws. It helps ensure public confidence in legal decision-making, according to proponents. Proponents of open justice have argued that public scrutiny permits those interested to \\"tap into the collective wisdom of what passes for fairness in similar cases\\". It facilitates a comparison of cases. A British judge commented: Governments trying to cope with terrorism have often sought to limit information in trials involving suspected terrorists. Photo: press conference for the Guantanamo Bay military commissions. Still, practical considerations often mean that the ideal of open justice must be weighed against other values such as privacy and cost and national security. =National security concerns= There are some cases in which publicity in a courtroom proceeding can be detrimental. In some cases, courts have opted to keep trials secret in proceedings against persons charged with terrorism, to protect its intelligence gathering methods and contacts from exposure. In a case in Britain, in which a soldier was on trial for murdering an Afghan insurgent, there was an effort to keep the trial secret to protect him from possible future retribution, but there were calls for the identity of the soldier to be publicized based on the principle of open justice. In situations when aspects of trials are kept secret, critics favoring open justice have argued that the secrecy is not needed for national security but is \\"nothing more than a useful drape to cover the inconvenient or the merely embarrassing.\\" Lawyers have often referred to the principle of open justice when disagreeing with a decision that was made, or calling for a retrial. In the United Kingdom, courts have tried to find the right balance between openness and secrecy, particularly in sensitive cases. In the United States, there have been concerns that the principle of open justice has not been applied to cases of immigrants \\"wrongly ensnared in the post-9/11 law enforcement dragnet\\" who were denied access to lawyers and relatives and sometimes deported after secret removal proceedings. =Privacy concerns= There are other factors which sometimes must be balanced against the need for open justice. For example, there are situations in which the release of confidential information such as private financial records might harm the reputation of one of the parties. In other situations, it may be necessary to protect the privacy of a minor. A further case in which openness is seen as unnecessary are when legal matters involve uncontentious information unrelated to public issues, such as the financial division of an estate after a death. Another factor sometimes working against the ideal of open justice is complexity; according to one view, court proceedings over time \\"have evolved into a complex system that is hard for outsiders to understand.\\" In the aftermath of the Bridgegate scandal in New Jersey, an appellate judge ruled against releasing the identities of some persons involved in the scandal, on the grounds of being \\"sensitive to the privacy and reputation interests of uncharged third parties\\"; that is, releasing names to the media might unfairly tarnish reputations without a trial.May 17, 2016, Tim Darragh of Advance Media, The Star-Ledger, Bridgegate names to remain secret for now, court rules, Retrieved September 8, 2016 Another judge commented on tradeoffs which sometimes work against openness: There is an Open Justice Initiative within the legal community to make justice more transparent.

An Inter-Allied Commission of Enquiry that investigated the incidents, submitted a report, on 1 June 1921, about the events. In general it accepted the Greek claims that Turkish troops massacred more than 12,000 local civilians, while 2,500 were missingReports on atrocities in the districts of Yalova and Guemlek and in the Ismid Peninsula, p. 11 and stated that the atrocities committed by the Turks in the Izmit peninsula \\"have been more considerable and ferocious than those on the part of the Greeks\\".Shenk, 2012Ionian vision: Greece in Asia Minor, 1919-1922, Michael Llewellyn Smith, page 215, 1998 Background Ethnic cleansing policies undertaken by the Ottoman government were launched in various regions of the Ottoman Empire, including the Izmit region as early as 1915. This included the massive deportation of local Greek and Armenian communities. In 1915, The New York Times reported that 19,000 Greeks from the Izmit province had been uprooted from their homes and driven to purely Turkish districts.Turks are evicting native Christians. 12 July 1915. The New York Times, p. 4 The Armenian Metropolitan of Izmit, Stephan Hovakimian stated, that, of the 80,000 Armenians belonging to his Diocese, 70,000 had been lost in exile, succumbing to hunger and exhaustion from long marches, and the slaughter of men and women upon arrival at their destination.K.Faltaits. The Genocide of the Greeks in Turkey. Cosmos 2016. pp.103-4 Later, in 1918, after the Armistice of Mudros a number of attacks by nationalist bands against the local Christian population were reported. Incidents This violence increased against the local Greek population, from March 1920 and especially during June‚ÄìJuly 1920, when the advance of the Hellenic Army in the region was imminent. These groups were operating as far as √úsk√ºdar, while some of them were organized by the Turkish Nationalist Movement. As a result of this activity, several villages of the region were burnt and their population decimated, especially in the regions south, north and northeast of Adapazarƒ±, as well as south and southeast of Iznik. The presence of the Hellenic Army in the region from July 1920, limited the activity of the Turkish bands, although in Karam√ºrsel, south of the Gulf of ƒ∞zmit, some Turkish nationalist groups were still attacking surrounding villages inhabited by Greek populations. Later, the Hellenic Army in the region, was accused of supporting assaults against some villages east of Beykoz. Accusations included the killing of civilians and the burning of small settlements. Accusations also included violence perpetrated by local Greek civilians who had previously suffered from Turkish atrocities Reports on atrocities in the districts of Yalova and Gemlik and in the Izmit Peninsula, p. 10 From the spring of 1921, the activity of the Turkish bands increased in the region extending geographically to the south of Izmit, which resulted in the destruction of the Christian villages there. Evacuation of Izmit In the early summer of 1921, due to the developments of the ongoing Greco-Turkish War, the retreat of the Hellenic Army was imminent. The Christian population had become panic-stricken fearing a wholesale massacre by the Kemalists,British Reports on Ethnic Cleansing in Anatolia, 1919-1922: The Armenian-Greek Section edited by Vartkes Yeghiayan 2007 p 211 so it was decided that the civilians were to be evacuated. As a result, a total of 22,000 inhabitants who had sought refuge in the city during the Hellenic occupation in addition to the ca. 10,000 Greek and Armenian inhabitants of the city who wished to be evacuated in order to avoid persecution by the Turkish nationalist movement, left the area.Solomonidis, 1984: p. 170 According to the British High Commission, 33,000 people were evacuated. Of these, approximately 21,000 were Greeks, 9,000 were Armenians, and 3,000 were Turks and Circassians. They were distributed as follows:- *7,600 to Volos *4,000 to Rodosto *3,000 to Pyrgo (Greece) *4,500 to Lemnos *3,800 to Samos *8,000 to Mytilene Aftermath An Inter-Allied Commission of Enquiry that investigated the incidents in the region generally accepted the claims by Greek authorities that 32 villages had been looted or burned, and that more than 12,000 local civilians had been massacred by Turkish forces, and 2,500 were missing. The Commission accepted these figures as \\"fundamentally true, notwithstanding a certain amount of exaggeration in the figures\\". According to British journalist and latter historian, Arnold Toynbee, as a result of the activities of the Hellenic Army and irregulars, up to 300 persons were killed. Toynbee in general omits to notice the conclusion of the Allied commission. Moreover, Winston Churchill, stated that the Greek atrocities were on a minor scale compared to the appalling deportations of Greeks from the Trebizond and Samsun provinces, undertaken by the Turkish nationalists in the same year. Partial list of affected settlements The Allied commission concluded that 35 villages in the region were affected due to the activity of Turkish nationalist bands.

The side acts as the national development team of the Papua New Guinea Football Association, and is limited to players who are under the age of 23. The side made their debut in the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League in the 2009‚Äì10 season, finishing bottom of the table. Since then, they have made gradual progress, with their best success coming in 2018, when they reached the Grand Final for the first time, losing 3‚Äì0 to Toti City Dwellers. History The side first entered the National Soccer League ahead of the 2009‚Äì10 season, with the players consisting of players who had been selected at an U20 competition in Lae earlier in 2009. The side were managed by former Welgris coach Matthew Witu. In November, tragedy struck the side as their starting goalkeeper, Fenney Bonki, lost his life after being hit in a vehicle accident. The side picked up just one win, against Rapatona, and four draws, finishing bottom of the table. However, midfielder Emmanuel Simon picked up the Player of the Season award. In September 2010, it was confirmed that the side would return to the National Soccer League for the 2010‚Äì11 season. For a while it looked as if the team would continue to struggle, having been unable to pick up a win in any of their first six games, but the side finally picked up their first win of the season on 22 January 2011 with a 5‚Äì2 victory over Madang Fox. They followed this up with a win against Tukoko University before a 1‚Äì1 draw with champions Hekari United. Eventually, they squeezed into the playoffs after finishing in fourth place, just one point ahead of Petro Souths. However, a 5‚Äì1 defeat to Hekari in the semi-finals pushed them into the third-place match against Tukoko University, which was never played. The side therefore were awarded fourth place overall by virtue of their lower league position. Emmanuel Simon again won the division's Player of the Season award, while striker Jamal Seeto, aged 18, won the Golden Boot. The 2011‚Äì12 season was a little turbulent, with weather affecting the ability for some matches to be played, but Besta continued their gradual improvement, picking up seven wins and finishing third in the regular season table. They faced second-placed Eastern Stars in the semi-final, but went down to a narrow 1‚Äì0 defeat. In the third-place playoff, they took on Tukoko University, where, after the score was level at 2‚Äì2 after regular time, the side went on to secure third place with a 3‚Äì2 victory in the penalty shoot-out. Emmanuel Simon picked up the Player of the Season award for the third consecutive season. By the end of 2012, Besta PNG were one of only four teams to have completed the necessary paperwork ahead of the upcoming season, which as a result ended up being delayed until 2013. In the end, Besta were one of eight teams and once again improved their stance, finishing second in the regular season table and again qualifying for the playoffs. However, they were unable to translate this form to the playoffs, where they once again fell in the semi-finals, losing 2‚Äì0 to new franchise FC Port Moresby despite early pressure on the visitors' goal. They were, however, able to secure third place for the second successive season with a 3‚Äì2 victory over Gigira Laitepo Morobe, thanks to a Cooper Ipako hat-trick. For the next three seasons, the side suffered a dip in form, failing to qualify for the playoffs on each occasion. In 2014, they finished sixth out of seven teams, winning three games and losing eight. In 2015, they managed just two victories and finished bottom of the league, despite a shock 2‚Äì1 victory over reigning champions Hekari United. In the 2015‚Äì16 season, they were one of six teams in the league's Northern Conference, where they finished 5th. In the two years after several clubs broke away from the league as part of the Football Federation Papua New Guinea, Besta PNG's fortunes improved dramatically. In the 2017 season, the club finished fourth in the regular season table, qualifying for the playoffs. In the semi-final, they faced regular season champions Lae City Dwellers, and went down 2‚Äì1 after extra time. However, their third-placed match against PS United was never scheduled after their opponents withdrew before even playing their semi-final. This meant they were awarded third place by default. The following season, they went one better, finishing third in the regular season table before securing a tight 1‚Äì0 victory over Morobe Wawens in the semi-finals to reach the Grand Final for the first time in their history. However, they went down 3‚Äì0 in the final against Toti City Dwellers. Following the reunification of football in the nation ahead of the 2019 season, the club was drawn into the Northern Conference alongside reigning champions Toti City. The side started the season sluggishly, losing three of their opening five games to Lahi United, Morobe United and Laiwaden FC. A 3‚Äì3 draw with Markham FC was followed by a narrow defeat to Toti City 2‚Äì3, with the side having led 2‚Äì0. However, the second half of the season was a huge success, with the side overturning all seven of their opponents, but narrowly missing out on qualification thanks to the consistent form of eventual qualifiers Toti and Morobe. The side eventually finished third in the conference.

Then, on 18 December 1793, on request of Duhem, the Convention adopted a decree which ordered that he had to be transferred to Paris.

She was noted for her performances of French works, many of them new to Britain, for giving the world premieres of Benjamin Britten's orchestral song cycles Our Hunting Fathers (1936) and Les Illuminations (1940), and for encouraging other composers to set English and French texts. Among those who wrote for her were Lennox Berkeley, Arnold Cooke, Roberto Gerhard, Elizabeth Maconchy, Peter Racine Fricker, Alan Rawsthorne and M√°ty√°s Seiber. Life and career Wyss was born to a musical family in La Neuveville, Canton of Bern, Switzerland. Her two sisters, Emilie Perret-Wyss and Colette Feschotte-Wyss, were also singers, and the three sometimes performed together.Gyde, Humphrey. Liner notes to Symposium Records CD 1409, retrieved 9 June 2014 She studied at the Geneva Conservatoire and the Basle Music Academy.

Making her home in England, Wyss embarked on a career as a soloist. At first she failed to impress the critics. After an early recital in London in 1927, The Times said, \\"Miss Wyss has some pleasant notes in her voice, but the tone was tight in the upper range. A pronounced wobble, which appeared now and then, and a tendency to go out of tune showed that she has not yet gained sufficient control over her voice.\\"\\"Miss Sophie Wyss\\", The Times, 17 December 1927, p. 10 By the 1930s her notices had improved from reserved to enthusiastic.

An active supporter of the Communist Tudeh Party of Iran from the late 1940s to the mid 1980s, he distanced himself from its leadership in 1988‚Äì1990, and turned into an outspoken critic in the mid 1990s.  Life  Siavash Kasrai was born into a family of officials, some (his uncle Abdol-Karim Kasrai in particular) with a serious interest in literature. In Tehran since his early age, he received his primary education at Adab School, and secondary education at the Military College and Dar ul-Funun. He graduated from the University of Tehran, Faculty of Law, in 1950, and did his military service at the Military Academy. In the early 1950s, Kasrai served at the Iranian Health Cooperation Agency, created under Truman‚Äôs Point Four Program, and headed two of the agency‚Äôs periodicals (Behdashte Hamegani dar Nahiyeye Dariaye Khazar, Zendegi o Behdasht). From the mid 1950s to the early 1980s, Kasrai almost continuously served in government bodies focusing on housing or urban development: the Iranian Bank of Housing, the Housing Agency, and the Ministry of Housing and Urbanization. In the early to mid 1970s, in a forced leave from the Ministry, he worked a few years as chief copywriter for the Behshahr Industrial Group. In addition to his regular employment, Kasrai occasionally taught literature at the Universities of Tehran and Zahedan. During his secondary education, Kasrai was part of a group of young nationalists including Dariush Forouhar and Mohsen Pezeshkpour. In 1948 he became member of the Tudeh Party, which he actively supported during the next four decades. Kasrai was shortly imprisoned in the aftermath of 1953 overthrow of Mohammad Mosaddegh. He was a founding member of the Iranian Writers‚Äô Association, and one of its elected secretaries in the first four years of its existence, from 1968 to 1971. Kasrai took part in 1977 Tehran Goethe-Institut nights of poetry readings, a noted public event with dissident overtones in the pre-Iranian Revolution period. As a result of a post- revolution crackdown on Tudeh supporters, he left Iran in 1983, resided in Kabul until late 1987, in Moscow until 1995, and then in Vienna. Kasrai was elected to the Tudeh Party Political Bureau in 1986. He resigned from the party‚Äôs Bureau in 1988 and from its Central Committee in 1990. Kasrai‚Äôs last major work (Mohreye Sorkh), published in 1995, was a public expression of disappointment with Communist activity. Kasrai had an intense social life, informed by his intellectual interests and an ethic of solidarity. He was, at various junctures, in close personal relationships with such literary figures as Iraj Afshar, Ahmadreza Ahmadi, Houshang Ebtehaj (alias H. E. Sayeh), Mahmoud Etemadzadeh (alias M. E. Behazin), Forough Farrokhzad, Morteza Keyvan, Nader Naderpour, Shahrokh Meskoob, Fereydoon Moshiri, Brayim Younisi, and Nima Yooshij. He was holding informal eclectic salons at both his office and his home on an almost daily basis from the early 1960s to the early 1980s.  Literary work  Siavash Kasrai Kasrai‚Äôs works were first published in the following volumes (with only the 2003a reference including both previously published and unpublished materials): * 1957.

These are all books of poetry, except the 1967a (a children book), 1975 (a piece of literary criticism), and 2003a (including literary criticism, interviews, and novels) publications. Kasrai‚Äôs complete collection of poems was published as a 773 pages octavo in 2005 in Tehran by Ketabe Nader Publications, under the title Az Ava ta Havaye Aftab. The second publication, Arashe Kamangir, brought public recognition to Kasrai. Arash is a legendary figure saving his country from the humiliation and misery of defeat by putting his soul into an arrow, which will travel over and gain back lost territory. Kasrai‚Äôs version is the first epic poem in Nima Yooshij‚Äôs style, or more generally the first epic instance of Persian new poetry. The poem was dedicated to Khosro Roozbeh, a radical leftist executed in early 1958. In spite of what appeared to some as technical weakness, and in spite of the authors‚Äô proposed dissident interpretation, Kasrai‚Äôs Arashe Kamangir was one of the few contemporary poems to find its way in schoolbooks. Mohreye Sorkh, Kasrai‚Äôs last publication (in his lifetime), is a mirror image of Arashe Kamangir. Like Arashe Kamangir, Mohreye Sorkh is an epic in the new poetry style, indeed a modern follow up to Ferdowsi‚Äôs Rostam and Sohrab, with a proposed political interpretation. But whereas Arashe Kamangir is a tale of sacrifice and salvation, Mohreye Sorkh is one of compromise and loss. Published after Kasrai‚Äôs break up with the Tudeh Party and a move from Moscow to Vienna, Mohreye Sorkh is an expression of regret or repentance over decades of Communist activity. Indeed, connecting his poem to current suffering in his country, Kasrai's preface speaks of ‚Äúthe serious mistakes of benevolent people whose actions proceeded from fascination instead of knowledge, hurried and shortsighted, leading to the verge of destruction, and now facing the heavy price to pay.‚Äù References  Sources  * Abedi, Kamyar. 2000.

The subtext reads: Conteyning the Practise of the Justices of the Peace Out of Their Sessions, Gathered for the Better Helpe of Such Justices of Peace as Have Not Beene Much Conversant in the Studie of the Lawes of this Realme. The book is a manual which was used by English justices of the peace. It went through about 20 editions between its first edition in 1618 and the last in 1746. With its roots in Crompton, Fitzherbert and Lambard, the book offers advice on a wide range of issues including levying customs, highways, prisons, riots, soldiers, murder, felonies, rogues, vagabonds, wool and high treason. The alphabetical listing of topics was groundbreaking and was a model for the structure of other books that came later. The Country Justice was one of many, but perhaps the most influential, of legal handbooks through which English common law entered into the legal system of early settlement in New England. Dalton was a justice of the peace in Cambridge and wrote this handbook to guide local justices of the peace who had no formal legal training. The simple, direct writing style contributed to the popularity of the book both in England and in the colonies. There was an earlier handbook, also alphabetized, written by William Lambarde, called the Eirenarcha. By 1619 Lambarde‚Äôs book had already seen 13 editions. Included among the many issues dealt with in The Country Justice were guidelines to deal with witchcraft and witches. Dalton emphasized the need for body searches to find evidence of demonic contacts.

Kiefer (February 26, 1921‚ÄîJune 14, 1961)Reference 7 was an American murderer and the last person to be executed in Indiana before the national moratorium on executions in 1972 with the case of Furman v. Georgia.  Crime and surrender  In 1957, Kiefer, a Fort Wayne mechanic, murdered his wife, Pearl; he later claimed that he was sick of her criticizing his fishing and drinking habits. He bludgeoned her to death with a hammer before turning that hammer on his five-year-old daughter, Dorothy, when Dorothy approached him to try to break up the fight between her parents. After murdering them, Kiefer hacked their bodies with a knife and then left for Chicago with $3 from his wife's purse and some change from his daughter's piggy bank. Two days later, he returned to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and went to police headquarters to surrender.  Trial and proceedings  Kiefer did not appear to show remorse for the murders of his wife and his daughter. He was charged with both the murders, but he only went to trial for his wife's murder. He was convicted in 1958 and sentenced to death. However, in 1958, the conviction was overturned by the Indiana Supreme Court, which noted that at his first trial, the jury was shown photographs of the slashed victims' bodies, and the jury was emotionally fueled by the photos to sentence Kiefer to death. Kiefer was sent to trial a second time and again sentenced to death.  Execution  Kiefer's first death warrant decreed that he would be executed on January 31, 1961, but eight hours before that execution took place, the Indiana Supreme Court stayed the execution. His attorney filed an appeal, but the rest of the Supreme Court declined to consider it, and the then-Governor of Indiana, Matthew E. Welsh, signed Kiefer's second death warrant for the execution to take place on June 14, 1961. On June 15, 1961, at 12:04 AM, Richard Kiefer began the walk, unassisted, to Indiana's electric chair. The warden of the Indiana State Prison in which Kiefer was executed, Warden Ward Lane, described Kiefer as having been emotionless at the execution. The voltage began at 12:11, and Kiefer was pronounced dead at 12:15 after receiving six jolts of electricity.Reference 1 He was 40 years old.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2012. The 2012 Pendle Borough Council election took place on 3 May 2012 to elect members of Pendle Borough Council in Lancashire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 18 *Labour 18 *Liberal Democrats 12 *British National Party 1 Background Before the election the Conservatives had 18 seats on the council, Labour 16, the Liberal Democrats 12, British National Party 2 and there was 1 independent. 17 seats were contested, with 2 seats available in Boulsworth after Conservative councillor George Askew resigned his seat on the council. This meant the Conservatives were defending 6 seats, Labour 5, Liberal Democrats 4 and the British National Party 1 seat. Among those standing down at the election was the Conservative leader of the council, Mile Blomeley from Reedley ward for health reasons, as well as Conservatives Valerie Langtree from Earby ward and Mike Calvert from Boulsworth ward, independent Glenn Whitaker from Craven ward and Labour's Mohammed Khalid from Walverden ward. As well as candidates from the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, there were 4 Green party candidates, 3 from the British National Party and 1 each from the Democratic Nationalists, English Democrats and UK Independence Party. Election result Labour gained seats in Reedley from the Conservatives and Vivary Bridge from the Liberal Democrats, to move level with the Conservatives on 18 seats each, while the Liberal Democrats remained on 12 seats after taking Craven ward where the only independent had stood down. The only other change saw one of the two British National Party councillors lose his seat to the Conservatives in Marsden ward by 37 votes. Overall turnout at the election was 37.8%. Joe Cooney was elected as the new leader of the Conservative group on the council, and then became leader of the council, after having only been a councillor for 12 months. This came after the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats agreed a coalition to run the council with 6 Conservatives and 4 Liberal Democrats on the council executive. Following the election the Conservative Member of parliament for Pendle, Andrew Stephenson, alleged that had been electoral fraud involving postal votes at the council election particularly pointing to the results in Reedley ward over the last two elections. 3 complaints regarding postal votes were investigated by the police, while councillors set up a working group to look at concerns.

Training as a painter, Villermont was a member of the Cercle des femmes peintres from 1888. Besides painting, she dedicated herself to writing for such periodicals as La Revue g√©n√©rale and La femme belge (which she also supported financially from 1913 to 1925). She was not only a contributor but also co-editor of La Revue Mauve, an up-market magazine about social and cultural issues published in Brussels from 1897 to 1899. A series of her essays on feminism was later published as the book Le Mouvement f√©ministe: Ses causes, son avenir, solution chr√©tienne (1900). In the early twentieth century, Villermont wrote a number of books, including biographies of Veronica Giuliani and Isabella Clara Eugenia. Her efforts to better the circumstances of women were not limited to writing. In 1903 she founded the first union of farming women at Ermeton-sur-Biert, leading to the establishment of the Cercle de Fermi√®res at Namur in 1909.Dictionnaire des femmes belges: XIXe et XXe si√®cles, ed. √âliane Gubin, Catherine Jacques, Val√©rie Piette & Jean Puissant (Brussels, 2006), pp. 199-200.

He founded COCO+CO., Inc. in 1991 and continues to lead the advertising agency as president and chief executive officer. He gained international notoriety between 2007 and 2010 when he fought‚Äîultimately successful‚Äîto be reunited with his same sex spouse when the United States' Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) separated them. Early life and education Tim Coco was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to Joseph, owner of a plumbing and heating company, and Annie, a homemaker. Coco is a life-long Haverhill, Massachusetts resident. He attended Haverhill Public Schools and graduated from Haverhill High School in 1979. He received his associate degree from Northern Essex Community College, Haverhill, Mass., and Bachelor's from Lesley University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the age of 17, Coco became an intern at WHAV Broadcasting Co., Haverhill, owner and operator of WHAV (AM) and then-WHAV-FM. By the time of his graduation from high school, he was a full-time employee of the news department. In 1981, he became a staff writer for the Scripps League Newspapers, Inc.-owned Haverhill Gazette. In 1985, he joined the then-Ottaway Newspapers, Inc.-owned Daily News of Newburyport as staff writer. While working at the Daily News of Newburyport, he was recruited by David Sokol of Ogden Corporation, New York, to develop community relations and marketing strategies for the company and serve as its spokesman. Personal life Shortly after Massachusetts permitted same-sex marriage, Coco married Genesio J. Oliveira, Jr. in 2005. Coco and Oliveira, a citizen of Brazil, met in 2002 while the latter was visiting Boston, Massachusetts. Immigration Judge Francis L. Cramer and, later, the Board of Immigration Appeals refused to recognize the marriage, citing the U.S. Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Oliveira was ordered to ‚Äúvoluntarily‚Äù depart the U.S. within 60 days and he complied Aug. 17, 2007, beginning what would be a three- year fight by the couple to be reunited. Coco used his advertising skills to launch an international campaign even as civil rights groups predicted the strategy would be unsuccessful. The couple created a website, www.reunitethisfamily.com; held candlelight vigils; won editorial coverage of their plight, posted videos online; placed an advertisement in Washington Post's Express newspaper, asking President Bush and Congress to ‚ÄúMake This Right!‚Äù \\"We didn't go into it to be activists, we went into it to be together,\\" Coco told the Associated Press in 2009. The campaign caught the attention of former presidential candidate and then-Senator John F. Kerry (D-Massachusetts) in 2008. After the election of President Barack Obama, Kerry worked with United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet A. Napolitano and Attorney General Eric Holder to arrange humanitarian Parole (United States immigration) ‚Äî ‚Äúa rare exemption that allows otherwise ineligible people into the country,‚Äù according to the Boston Globe. On June 2, 2010, Oliveira stepped onto U.S. soil. At about the same time, Francis L. Cramer‚Äîthe immigration judge that first refused to recognize the Coco-Oliveira marriage‚Äîretired. According to a July 28, 2008 U.S. Department of Justice report, ‚ÄúAn Investigation of Allegations of Politicized Hiring by Monica Goodling and Other Staff in the Office of the Attorney General,‚Äù confirmed Cramer was an illegal appointment, lacked basic immigration experience and apparently passed the DOJ's anti gay litmus test which favored immigration judges who espoused conservative priorities. Coco may have also played a role in the withdrawal of Senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) as U.S. commerce secretary by President Obama. He detailed for the media Gregg's role in having his former campaign treasurer, Cramer, appointed as immigration judge. Coco went on to file a complaint with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. COCO+CO., Inc. At Ogden, Coco was one of the first to embrace integrated corporation communications‚Äîthe concept of combining the previously discrete business functions of advertising, public relations, marketing communications, investor relations and regulatory affairs. In 1991, he founded COCO+CO. to share this concept with other industries. In 2012, Coco wrote, ‚Äú‚Ä¶messages crafted by separate advertising agencies, public relations firms and printers send inconsistent and confusing messages to prospects. Even business logos tended to disproportionately stretch or condense or appear in differing colors as each outside firm made different interpretations. With today's addition of the World Wide Web, social media, mobile devices, e-newsletters and other means of reaching audiences, the problem has grown exponentially.‚Äù Coco reasoned, ‚ÄúTo be successful, businesses must simply send relevant messages by vehicles most likely to reach target audiences. Unfortunately, this is neither the advice nor the services businesses receive because of the economic self interests and the conflicts of interests of their advisors.‚Äù Internet radio After the wave of mergers and consolidations struck the radio industry following passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, WHAV was merged into a small group of radio stations and ceased its traditional local programming. The WHAV call sign disappeared completely at the end of 2002. Coco resurrected the call as an Internet radio and cable television station Jan. 3, 2004 and federally trademarked the name in 2008. Although able to reach the world, Coco returned the station to its hyperlocal roots, restoring staple programs such as local news, Open Mike Show, community calendar, local weather, etc. In 2011, Coco spun WHAV off into a new nonprofit corporation, Public Media of New England, Inc. He continues to serve as volunteer president and general manager. In the fall of 2013, Coco submitted WHAV's application to the Federal Communications Commission for an LPFM license at 98.1 MHz. The station signed on at 97.9 FM in September, 2016. Politics Coco ran for Massachusetts state senate in 2012. While he won every precinct by a \\"landslide\\" in the largest city of the First Essex District, Haverhill, he narrowly lost the Democratic primary election by 704 votes to Kathleen O'Connor Ives.

Launched in 1983, it was operated in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 13¬∞ East, before moving to several other locations later in its operational life, before it was finally decommissioned in 1996. It was the first of five satellites launched to form the first-generation Eutelsat constellation. A Eutelsat I spacecraft, F-1 had a mass at launch of . Constructed by British Aerospace, it was designed to be operated for seven years and carried 12 Ku band transponders, two of which were set aside as spares. The satellite contained a Mage-2 solid rocket motor to perform orbit circularisation at apogee. ECS-1 was launched by Arianespace, using an Ariane 1 carrier rocket, flight number L06. The launch took place at 11:59:03 UTC on 16 June 1983, from ELA-1 at Kourou. Successfully deployed into geosynchronous transfer orbit, ECS-1 raised itself into an operational geostationary orbit using its apogee motor. Following commissioning operations conducted by the European Space Agency at a longitude of 10¬∞ East, the satellite was moved to its operational slot at 13¬∞ East, entering service on 12 October. After five years in service, Eutelsat I F-1 was replaced by the newly launched Eutelsat I F-4. For the next three years it covered a new slot at 16¬∞ East until the launch of Eutelsat II F-3. After brief operations at 17.5 and 25.5 degrees between 1991 and 1993, the satellite was moved to 48 degrees East for most of its last three years of service. Between February and March 1996 the spacecraft was moved to 36 degrees West, where it remained until November. The satellite was decommissioned in December 1996; leaving geosynchronous orbit on 11 December before deactivation on 16 December.

Built in 1890 and enlarged in 1914-15, it is a well-preserved example of a Late Victorian school building, and an emblem of the growth in that time of the city's west side. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It has been converted to residential use. Description and history The former Varney School building is located southwest of downtown Manchester, on the south side of Varney Street at its junction with Bowman Street. It is a 2¬Ω-story red brick building, consisting of a cruciform main block, to which a wing has been added to the rear. It is covered by a slate hip roof and is trimmed in granite. The main facade has a central gabled bay, with the main entrance set in a large round-arch recess lined with wooden paneling. The gable has a half-round light at its center, and is surmounted by an open square belfry capped by a pyramidal roof and finial. The main portion of the school was built in 1890, due to residential growth in the surrounding Piscataquog Village neighborhood, with the expansion wing added in 1914-15. It was designed by Frederick Stickney of Lowell, Massachusetts, whose work made provision for its eventual expansion. When first opened, it housed six classrooms.

The eldest son of King Nanda of the Toungoo Dynasty led three out of the five Burmese invasions of Siam between 1584 and 1593, all of which ended in complete failure. He died in action during the fifth invasion in 1593. In prevailing Thai history, he was killed in single combat by King Naresuan. However no other accounts, including the earliest Siamese records and European accounts, mention a formal duel between the two. The Burmese chronicles say Swa was felled by a Siamese mortar round. Early life Mingyi Swa was born to Crown Prince Nanda and his chief consort Hanthawaddy Mibaya on 27 November 1558 in Pegu (Bago).(Ohn Shwe 1966: xxviii): Sunday, 2nd waning of Nadaw 920 ME = 27 November 1558 per a contemporary poem Maha Upayaza eigyin by Thinkhaya, Governor of Talote about the early life of Mingyi Swa. He was the third child and the first son of the couple, and had six other full siblings.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 103 The prince grew up in Pegu during a period in which his grandfather King Bayinnaung founded the largest empire in Southeast Asia.Lieberman 2003: 152Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012: 134 Bayinnaung died on 10 October 1581, and Nanda succeeded the throne. Nanda made Swa his heir-apparent on 15 October 1581.(Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 73): Sunday, 5th waning of Tazaungmon 943 ME = 15 October 1581 The prince, who was not yet 23, was now the heir-apparent of an \\"absurdly overextended\\" empire.Lieberman 2003: 154‚Äì155, 161 Military campaigns The empire had been largely held together by Bayinnaung's personal relationships with his vassal rulers, who were loyal to Bayinnaung and not the kingdom of Toungoo.Lieberman 2003: 154‚Äì155 As it turned out, King Nanda never gained the full allegiance of his vassals. Within the first three years, both Ava (Inwa) and Siam revolted. Nanda put down the Ava rebellion but Siam proved a far more difficult project.Harvey 1925: 181‚Äì182 Nanda came to rely heavily on his eldest son to reconquer Siam. Between 1584 and 1593, Mingyi Swa would lead four out of five campaigns that all ended in failure for the invaders, and ultimately claimed his life. =First invasion of Siam (1584)= The Siamese revolt took place right under Mingyi Swa's watch. In April 1584, Nanda and his armies were in Upper Burma for the campaign against Ava. Mingyi Swa had stayed behind at the capital Pegu (Bago) with an army to guard the rear. The Siamese army led by Crown Prince Naresuan, instead of marching to Ava to join Nanda's armies, hovered around Pegu, and openly disobeyed Swa's orders to march to Ava. Naresuan withdrew to Martaban (Mottama), and formally declared Ayutthaya's independence from Pegu on . Still in Upper Burma, Nanda in haste sent two armies (11,000 men, 900 horses, 90 elephants) to chase the Siamese troops to their country. Swa was the deputy commander-in-chief behind his father.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 79‚Äì80 An 11,000-man invasion force could have never conquered Siam, let alone in the rainy season. Indeed, the troops were caught unprepared by the flooded countryside by the Chao Phraya, and were nearly wiped out by Siamese on their war canoes.Phayre 1967: 121 =Second invasion (1586)= In March 1586,Late Tagu 947 ME = 20 March 1586 to 8 April 1586 NS Swa again led another expedition force (12,000 troops, 1200 horses, 100 elephants) from Lan Na into northern Siam.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 81‚Äì82 The goal was to seize northern Siam in preparation for a larger campaign planned for the following dry season. But the army could not get past a heavily fortified Lampang, and had to withdraw in June as the rainy season came. =Third invasion (1586‚Äì1587)= Despite the failure to conquer northern Siam, Nanda proceeded with his planned invasion of Siam in October 1586, targeting the Siamese capital itself. Swa was left to guard Pegu.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 84 Nanda's invasion too failed. He laid siege to Ayutthaya for over four months (December 1586 to April 1587) but could not break through. Only a small portion of the original 25,000 men made it back to Pegu.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 85‚Äì86 =Fourth invasion (1590‚Äì1591)= Nanda had not given up. In 1590, the king again ordered Swa to lead another invasion of northern Siam. Nanda had planned a full-scale invasion but had to scale back his plans to northern Siam because northern Shan states of Mohnyin and Mogaung had also revolted. On , Swa again invaded northern Siam from Lan Na.(Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 90): 12th waning of Tazaungmon 952 ME = It was essentially a repeat of the 1586 invasion except in the severity of defeat. Like in 1586, his army could not again get past the Lampang fort led by Naresuan. But unlike in 1586, it was no mere retreat. The 24-regiment, 20,000-man army was thoroughly defeated outside Lampang in March 1591. The remaining regiments arrived back in such disarray that Nanda verbally disparaged Mingyi Swa and executed some of the top generals.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2003: 90 =Fifth and final campaign (1592‚Äì1593)= The momentum of the war was swinging to Siam's favor. In the following dry season of 1591‚Äì1592, Naresuan raided the upper Tenasserim coast. In response, Nanda and the court agreed to another invasion of Siam. Nanda again appointed Swa commander-in-chief but also appointed his vassal rulers of Prome, Toungoo and Lan Na as deputies.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2003: 92Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 93 On ,(Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 93) gives Wednesday, 12th waxing of Nadaw 954 ME which translates to Sunday, . But (Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 93) corrects it as Wednesday, 2nd waning of Nadaw, which translates to Wednesday, 4 November 1592, NS. two armies (24,000 men, 2000 horses, 150 elephants) tried again. The invasion ended in failure, and in Mingyi Swa's death in a battle near Ayutthaya. Both Burmese and Siamese chronicles say he died in battle but they give different accounts of how exactly he died, and when he died. Burmese chronicle account According to the Burmese chronicles, Swa's forces penetrated all the way to the outskirts of Ayutthaya. There, the army was met by Naresuan's army. On , a battle ensued. Both Burmese and Siamese commanders fought on war elephants. During the course of the battle, a Burmese war elephant named Pauk-Kyaw Zeya () ridden by the governor of Zapayo (), went on musth, and initially charged Siamese vanguard lines toward Naresuan. But the elephant was pushed back. It returned to the Burmese lines, and went after Swa's elephant.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 94Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 94 Swa and his two mahouts unsuccessfully tried to fight off the enraged elephant but their elephant was pushed out of position into the open view of the enemy. Both elephants immediately came under Siamese fire, and Swa and the front mahout were felled by a mortar round. The lone survivor, the middle mahout named Tuyin Bala (), tried to hide Swa's death by having the crown prince's body lean over his back while he managed to drive his elephant to the back of the lines. No one in Burmese or Siamese command knew of the death, and the battle went on. The battle ended with the Siamese army retreating to Ayutthaya. After the battle, the Burmese command now led by Thado Dhamma Yaza III of Prome realized the death, and they collectively decided to retreat, rather than to attack the city. Siamese accounts Thai commemoration of single combat between Naresuan and Mingyi Swa at Nong Sarai There are four different Siamese accounts about the battle. The prevailing Thai history follows the account given in the Ayutthaya chronicle. The prevailing account says that the Burmese army led by Swa had penetrated deep into Siam to a place called Nong Sarai (in present-day Suphan Buri Province.) There, the invaders were met by the Siamese army, led by Naresuan (now king) and his younger brother Crown Prince Ekathotsarot. The two armies fought on ,(Damrong 2001: 128): Monday, 2nd waning of the second Siamese month 954 CS = Monday, 18 January 1593 NS. (ten days later than the Burmese chronicle date). The Burmese army is said to have won the initial skirmishes, and pressed down on the Siamese vanguard army.Wyatt 2003: 88‚Äì89 Naresuan, Ekathotsarot and their few bodyguards stood their ground and fought on. But because other Siamese vanguard forces fell back, the king and the crown prince came to be surrounded by the Burmese forces. Facing certain death, Naresuan issued a challenge to Mingyi Swa to fight him in single combat on their war elephants.Damrong 2001: 131 Although his troops had the two top Siamese royals surrounded, Swa, for some reason, accepted the challenge. (The Siamese historian Prince Damrong Rajanubhab's conjecture is that the Burmese crown prince accepted the challenge because of his \\"kingly pride consistent with his royal birth,\\" and because he was \\"ashamed not to accept it\\".) At any rate, the two men and their crews then fought on war elephants. Swa is said to have landed his sword on the helmet of Naresuan. But Naresuan recovered and cut down Swa on the right shoulder, killing Swa on the spot. In the meantime, Ekathotsarot on his elephant also fought with the governor of \\"Muang Chachro\\", and killed the governor as well.Damrong 2001: 132 The Burmese forces then started shooting, killing Naresuan's front mahout and Ekathotsarot's middle mahout. A bullet even hit the king's hand. But Siamese forces came forward soon enough, and rescued the Siamese king and the crown prince to safety. However, no other Siamese accounts, including the two earliest Siamese accounts about the battle written in 1647 and 1690, report a formal duel between Naresuan and Swa.Terwiel 2013: 22‚Äì23, 29 Analysis According to BJ Terwiel, there are ten different accounts of the battle by indigenous, European and Persian authors: (four Siamese, one Burmese, four late 16th and early 17th century European accounts and late 17th century one Persian account).Terwiel 2013: 30 Only the Siamese royal chronicle account says there was a formal elephant duel between Naresuan and Swa.Terwiel 2013: 22‚Äì25 Per Terwiel's analysis of the ten accounts, Swa and Naresuan both fought on their war elephant in the battle but no formal duel probably ever took place. According to Terwiel, it is highly unlikely that Swa would have agreed to a formal duel since agreeing to do so would have \\"jeopardized the costly invasion that had thus far progressed without a hitch.\\"Terwiel 2013: 31‚Äì32 During the battle, Naresuan's elephant got surrounded by the Burmese forces. During that crucial moment, a Burmese war elephant went musth, and attacked Swa's elephant. Seeing that Swa was in difficulty, Naresuan \\"closed in, and he (or one of the warriors riding with him, maybe a Portuguese) fired a gun which mortally wounded the crown prince\\" Swa.Terwiel 2013: 33 Naresuan was \\"lucky to escape from a very dangerous situation\\" but also quick to take advantage of it.Terwiel 2013: 34 According to Terwiel, the \\"Burmese and European accounts stayed closer to what actually may have happened\\", and \\"Naresuan's much repeated challenge to hold a duel, even though it looms large in many Thai history books, should be relegated to a legendary tale.\\" Aftermath In spite of all the differences, all Burmese and Siamese accounts agree that the two armies fought a battle near Ayutthaya in which Swa fell in action, and that the Burmese forces retreated afterwards. It was the last of Pegu's campaigns in Siam. Siam's independence was now secured. For the next dozen years, it was Burma that would be on the defensive, \\"the tables of war turning for the first time in 30 years.\\" Mingyi Swa's body was brought back to Pegu in February 1593.(Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 95): Tabaung 954 ME = 31 January 1593 to 1 March 1593 NS King Nanda is said to have been completely saddened, and gave his eldest son a royal cremation ceremony with highest honors in front of the Kanbawzathadi Palace.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 95 The fallen prince was 34. A shaken Nanda waited over nine months before appointing Minye Kyawswa II as the new heir apparent on .(Maha Yazawin Vol. 3: 95): Wednesday, 8th waxing of Pyatho 955 ME = 29 December 1593 Personal life His first wife was Natshin Medaw, his double cousin and the only child of Viceroy Thado Minsaw of Ava and Inwa Mibaya.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 77 She was by his side when he became the crown prince in 1581. According to the chronicles, he spent much of his time pursuing another woman‚ÄîPrincess Yaza Datu Kalaya, who was his half-aunt. (She was a year younger than him, however.Ohn Shwe 1966: xxviii) In 1583, Natshin Medaw bitterly complained to her parents, which contributed to a major fallout between her parents and Nanda. The fallout led to the 1584 Ava rebellion.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 78‚Äì79 Swa continued to pursue Yaza Datu Kalaya, and the princess continue to spurn his advances in the following years. The princess was protected by her half-brother Nanda. But in October 1586, Nanda left Pegu with the army for his regime's third invasion of Siam. With his father gone, Swa forcibly raised the princess to be his wife, and formally divorced Natshin Medaw in the process. Nanda arrived back to Pegu in June 1587 from a failed campaign, and the king was extremely unhappy to learn of the news what had happened while he was away.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 88 Nanda nonetheless did not break up the marriage. Kalaya remained Swa's chief wife to his death.Htin Aung 1967: 137 Notes References Bibliography     * Category:Heirs apparent of Toungoo dynasty Category:1558 births Category:1593 deaths Category:Deaths by projectile weapons ","title":"Mingyi Swa"},{"id":"43000070","text":"Jermaine Woozencroft (born 19 August 1992) is a Jamaican international footballer who plays for Montego Bay United, as a midfielder.

W., High- level shores in the region of the Great Lakes and their deformation: Am. Jour. Sei., 3d ser., vol. 12, 1891, p. 204 Beaches The ice sheet had withdrawn north of the \\"thumb\\" of Michigan, then advanced southward, raising water levels to the east of the \\"thumb\\", but not those to the west. This created four distinct areas around Lake Arkona: # In the Saginaw basin, where the Arkona beaches were neither submerged nor modified; # The area on the \\"thumb\\", where the beaches were overridden by the ice and destroyed; # The Black River valley, where the beaches were submerged but protected from modification; and # The area, which would be Lake Whittlesey, where the beaches were submerged and modified by storm waves. =Modified beaches= Summary of prehistoric beaches from the six glacial lakes that preceded the modern Lake Erie From Spring Hill and Zion to the Ohio state line in southeastern Lenawee County, the three Arkona beaches are faint and hard to trace. The same character continues throughout Ohio and Pennsylvania and western New York. Between Spring Hill and the Ohio state line the Arkona beaches do not show the characteristics normal to those in the Saginaw and Black River valleys. The beaches appear as ill-defined gravel or gravelly soil. In the first belt is the faintest, the second is slightly stronger, and the third is the strongest. Texture The most peculiar characteristic of the gravel belts is their stiff clay. The soil of these gravel belts is very stiff and forms clods. They are continuous for miles, maintaining a constant level, and then merge into a single set of ridges in the Black River valley. Unlike most beaches of sand, the remains of the Arkona beaches are only the base structure, which are heavily impregnated with clay. Except for their consistent elevation, they would not have been identified as beach remnants. The Arkona beaches have been heavily modified by wave actions and the emergence of Lake Whittlesey. Initially, Lake Whittlesey's waves began the process of washing the top portion of the Arkona beaches away. Then, the depth of the lake grew and water currents along the bottom of the lake moved the larger gravels up slope to become part of the Lake Whittlesey beaches. Then a period of deep quiet water allowed fine clays to leave suspension and be deposited among the remaining gravel. Distribution As far south as Lenox the three Arkona gravel belts are distinct. Beyond, there are a few intervals in which only two are discernible. Still farther southwest the first and second ridges draw closer together and the vertical interval between them diminishes until it is often difficult to distinguish the two. The three ridges are distinguishable some distance beyond Britton, where the upper two are of very nearly the same height. The same occurrence of three beaches was noted in the Saginaw basin between Flushing and Cass City, but west of Flushing only two beaches appear. In the Saginaw basin the Arkona beaches were not submerged, but they were uplifted. The full strength of the Arkona beach ridges near Cass City and Croswell makes it clear that the ice barrier stood at least 25 miles north, enough distance to allow a heavy on shore surf. Correlatives Lake Chicago was nearing its maximum at the time of Lake Arkona. In the Superior basin the ice sheet still covered the entire area. In New York the Finger Lakes had united with Lake Arkona with the exception of possibly the most easterly lakes.The Pleistocene of Indiana and Michigan, History of the Great Lakes; Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Vol. LIII; Frank Leverett and Frank B. Taylor; Washington, D.C,; Government Printing Office; 1915 The Lake Arkona water levels were close to the level of the First Lake Saginaw, and when the ice sheet retreated north from Lake Maumee, the merger of Maumee with Saginaw gave rise to Lake Arkona.Chapter XV, Glacial Lake Saginaw; Frank B. Taylor; The Pleistocene of Indiana and Michigan, History of the Great Lakes; Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Vol LIII; Frank Leverett and Frank B. Taylor; Washington, D.C,; Government Printing Office; 1915 Later the Laurentian ice sheet expanded southward to the Port Huron morainic system. The lake waters to the east and south began to rise by above the Arkona beaches, becoming Lake Whittlesey and the western area once again became Later Lake Saginaw.. This rise in the lake waters caused the obliteration of most of the Arkona beaches as described above. In some places the Arkona beaches stand by the outer border of the Port Huron morainic system.Publication 9.

It was probably built in the 12th or 13th century and is one of the largest medieval fortresses in Bosnia and Herzegovina. =Austria-Hungary= Part of the structure was destroyed in 1878 during the Austro-Hungarian invasion of Bosnia and Herzegovina. =World War II= Ustasha troops of the fascist Independent State of Croatia occupied the fortress along with the rest of Zvornik and most of Bosnia, in April 1941. The fortress was liberated in July 1943 by the 1st Proletarian Brigade during the Battle of Zvornik. =Bosnian War= Beginning on 8 April 1992, about 300 soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina defended the fortress from Serb soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army during the first stages of the Bosnian War. Following the Bosnian War, Zvornik became a part of Republika Srpska and the new Serb government had a church built on the grounds of the fortress and relocated a church bell from the village of Diviƒç to the new church to mark their victory over Bosniaks. In May 2013, the remains of several war victims from the 1990s conflict were uncovered in Kula grad.

Originally called Concord Square, Victory Park was laid out by the proprietors of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company who founded Manchester, and was first used as a common area, used by abutters for gardening and grazing. The park was sold by the proprietors to the city for $1 in 1848, conditioned on making alterations that would transform it into a park. The city did not immediately act on the required conditions, but it had by the 1870s become more parklike, with a fountain and thickly-planted trees. The park was renamed after the First World War; its most prominent feature is the Winged Victory Monument to the city's soldiers in that war, designed by Lucien Hippolyte Gosselin and erected in 1929. The park underwent a major rehabilitation in 1988. The district includes four buildings that face the park. The Manchester City Library (Carpenter Memorial Library), at 405 Pine Street, is a Beaux Arts structure built in 1914 and donated by Frank Carpenter in memory of his wife; it was designed by Edward Tilton. At 148 Concord Street stands the 1916 Manchester Institute of Arts and Science building, designed by Boston architect William Rantoul and built as a gift of Emma Blood French, Frank Carpenter's sister-in-law.

Background  Pi Guangye was born in 877, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang. His family was said to have been at Xiangyang for generations. His father Pi Rixiu was a prominent late-Tang poet. At one point, Pi Rixiu served as the assistant to the prefect of Su Prefecture (ËòáÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) in military matters, and he settled his family there. Pi Guangye was born at Su Prefecture. It was said that when he was nine, he was already capable of writing.  Service under Qian Liu  After Pi Guangye was grown, he went to see Qian Liu, who then ruled the modern Zhejiang region. Qian made Pi a member of his staff, along with Shen Song and Lin Ding. Pi was eventually given the title of assistant to Qian in Qian's role as military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang). In 916 ‚Äî by which time Tang had fallen and Qian's domain was known as the state of Wuyue as a vassal of Tang's main successor state Later Liang ‚Äî Qian wanted to offer tribute to then-Later Liang emperor Zhu Zhen, but the path to the Later Liang capital Daliang was blocked by the territory of the rival state Wu, and initially could not think of an appropriate emissary. He decided to commission Pi to do so, and Pi went through a circumlocutious route, through the territory of several fellow Later Liang vassals ‚Äî Jian (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian) and Ting (Ê±ÄÂ∑û, in modern Longyan, Fujian) Prefectures (under Min's prince Wang Shenzhi); Qian Prefecture (ËôîÂ∑û, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi) (under Tan Quanbo); Chen (ÈÉ¥Â∑û, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan), Tan (ÊΩ≠Â∑û, in modern Changsha, Hunan), and Yue (Â≤≥Â∑û, in modern Yueyang, Hunan) Prefectures (under Chu's prince Ma Yin); and Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) (under Gao Jichang) ‚Äî finally reaching Later Liang proper. Zhu was touched by the difficulty journey, and bestowed on Qian the title of generalissimo of all circuits.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. He also gave Pi the honorary title of Mishu Lang (), and also gave him the designation Jinshi Jidi () ‚Äî i.e., someone who had passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class, even though Pi did not appear to have ever submitted himself for such examinations. Not long after this mission, there were peace missions from Wu, and Qian sent Pi on a diplomatic mission to Wu in return. When Pi arrived at Wu, he was given an award of money, but was forbidden by the Wu government of actually carrying the money back to Wuyue and was told that he could spend the money to buy goods to take back to Wuyue. Pi responded, \\"I am a diplomat. I am not a merchant.\\" He thus left the money at the diplomatic station and left, and the Wu officials had to chase him down. Upon return, he was soon given the title of governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Zhexi (i.e., Zhenhai) and Zhedong (ÊµôÊù±, i.e., Wuyue's other main circuit Zhendong (ÈéÆÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang)).  Service under Qian Yuanguan and Qian Hongzuo  Qian Liu died in 932 and was succeeded as the ruler of Wuyue by his son Qian Chuanguan (who then changed his name to Qian Yuanguan), who, at that time, did not assume the title of king that Qian Liu had used.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Qian Yuanguan put Pi Guangye in charge of Zhendong Circuit. In 937, when Qian Yuanguan reclaimed the title of king, he commissioned Pi, as well as Cao Zhongda and Shen Song, chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Pi became responsible for drafting much of the law and the ceremonial regulations of the state. As chancellor, Pi was said to have paid much attention to his appearance and was capable of speaking, such that those who spoke to him considered him god-like in speech and disposition. He was a tea aficionado, and often wrote poems, referring to tea as \\"the bitter-mouthed teacher.\\" Many in the state followed his example. Pi appeared to continue to serve as chancellor after Qian Yuanguan died in 941 and was succeeded by his son Qian Hongzuo, for there was no indication that he was removed from office.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. He died in 943 and was given the posthumous name Zhenjing (Ë≤ûÊï¨, \\"honest and alert\\"). He left a 13-volume work about the sights that he had seen.

Tabscoob was a halach uinik (Maya ruler) of the Potonch√°n jurisdiction, known for leading the Chontal Maya in the Battle of Centla against Spanish forces led by Hern√°n Cort√©s on March 14, 1519. Tabscoob's administration maintained commercial ties with the Mexicas and other Maya jurisdictions, especially with the jurisdiction of Chak√°n Putum, who‚Äîafter having contact with the expeditions of Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba and Juan de Grijalva‚Äîwarned the Chontal to take precautions. On June 8, 1518, Juan de Grijalva landed in the province of Potonch√°n and met Tabscoob to whom, it is said, Grijalva gave his green velvet doublet.  War against Xicalango in 1513  Between Potonch√°n and the island of Tris was a Nahuatl town called Xicalango, which was a major port on the Gulf of Mexico, but being different from the Maya race, had constant friction with Potonch√°n since the Xicalangos frequently crossed territory within the province of Tabasco. This led to a war in the year 1513 in which Tabscoob led an army of 20,000 men and defeated the Xicalangos. It was the custom among the natives that the defeated make various gifts to the victors. Thus, the chief Tabscoob received a large number of slaves including Malintzin, famously known as \\"La Malinche.\\"  Meeting with Juan de Grijalva in 1518  Meeting of the Maya chief Tabscoob with the Spaniard Juan de Grijalva in 1518. On June 8, 1518, the Spaniard Juan de Grijalva landed at Potonch√°n. With the help of Maya interpreters, he began to engage in a friendly dialogue with the natives, as well as flattering them with gifts. Grijalva asked if they would call their boss to meet and confer with him. Thus, in time, Chief Tabscoob appeared with his nobles, greeting the Spanish captain. During the talk, both figures exchanged gifts: to Grijalva, Tabscoob presented gold plates in the form of armor and some feathers; whereas Grijalva gave the Maya chief his green velvet doublet. Tabscoob told Grijalva of a place called Culua that was \\"toward where the sun set...\\" there was much more of that material. Grijalva in turn, spoke with the Maya chief with courtesy, admitting that he came in the name of a great lord named Charles V, who was very good, and he wanted to have them as vassals. Tabscoob responded that they lived happily as they were, and that they needed no other lord, and that if Grijalva wanted to preserve his friendship with Tabscoob, the Spanish expedition should leave. Grijalva, after stocking water and provisions, embarked on his way to Culua (modern-day San Juan de Ul√∫a).  Arrival of Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1519  The entrance of Hern√°n Cort√©s into the city of \\"Potonch√°n\\" or \\"Tabasco.\\" On March 12, 1519, Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s reached the mouth of the Grijalva River. He decided to anchor his ships and enter the river in skiffs, looking for the great city of Indians described by Juan de Grijalva. Cort√©s landed in a place called Punta de Palmares right at the mouth of the river. Cort√©s said, by way of a translator, to some Indians who were in a boat that he and his men \\"would do them no harm, [and that] they came in peace and only wanted to speak with them.\\" But Cort√©s, seeing that the natives were still threatening, commanded weapons be brought onto the skiffs and handed them to archers and musketeers, and he began planning how to attack the town. = Takeover of Potonch√°n = The next day, March 13, 1519, Cort√©s devised a strategy to attack Potonch√°n. He sent Alonso de Avila with one hundred soldiers who were on the road leading to the village, while Cort√©s and the other group of soldiers went in the skiffs. There, on the shore, Cort√©s made a \\"requerimiento\\" (requisition) in front of a notary of the king named Diego de Godoy, to let them disembark, thus issuing the first notarial act in Mexico.Colegio de Notiarios P√∫blicos de Tabasco. El Notariado en M√©xico Given the refusal of the Indians, Cort√©s decided to attack, starting the fight. The hosts of Tabscoob and Cortes met in full combat. The forces of Alonso de √Åvila arrived at the rear of the settlement, making the natives flee and consummating the Spanish conquistadors' takeover of the town. = Battle of Centla = Battle of Centla between the hosts of Tabscoob and the army of Hern√°n Cort√©s. On March 14, the hosts of Tabscoob, estimated by Cortes to be 40,000 men, fought on the plains of Cintla against the Spaniards led by Hern√°n Cort√©s. The Battle of Centla ensued, which would be the first major battle of the Spanish conquistadors in what later became New Spain. The power of the Spaniards' firearms and the surprise and fear caused by the appearance of the cavalry (since the natives had never seen horses and thought that animal and rider were one) eventually gave victory to the Spanish army of over 410 soldiers.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, Days later, on April 16, chief Tabscoob and his entourage appeared before Cortes, swearing allegiance and subjection to the Spanish Crown. And, as was the Indian tradition, Tabscoob gifted 20 native women to Cort√©s, including Malintzin, who would become a valuable weapon for Cort√©s in the conquest of Mexico. But the conquest of Tabasco was far from achieved, as the Indians often rebelled against the Spaniards. It would take 45 years of struggles and intense military campaigns, before the Spanish conquistadors could break the fighting spirit of the indigenous people of Tabasco.

He is considered to be the worldwide authority on the subject of smut fungi and has dominated the taxonomic study of Ustilaginomycetes for at least the past four decades. Early life and education V√°nky was born in (), Romania, 15 June 1930. He attended the Bethlen J√°nos Reformed School and, after it closed in 1945, the United Grammar School in Odorhei until 1949. He then began his studies at the University of Cluj (Kolozsv√°r) in Hungarian but completed his degree in biology at the University of Bucharest in 1953. Early career Between 1953 and 1957 he worked as a researcher with Professor Traian SƒÉvulescu at the Department of Phytopathology of the Agricultural Research Institute, Bucharest, Romania, where he began studying smut fungi. However ‚Äì as he always wanted to be a physician ‚Äì in 1957 he left Bucharest for the Faculty of Medicine, T√Ærgu-Mure≈ü (Marosv√°s√°rhely), Romania, where he obtained his MD in 1961. From 1961 until 1964 he worked as a general practitioner in Odorhei (Sz√©kelyudvarhely), then, until 1969, he worked as a balneologist in Borsz√©k but continued studying and collecting smut fungi. In 1969 he left Ceau≈üescu‚Äôs Romania and settled in Sweden, where he obtained the Swedish MD and worked as a family physician in Gagnef village. He continued to pursue and personally fund his research in the field of smut fungus taxonomy and obtained his PhD in taxonomic botany at Uppsala University in 1985 (under supervision of Prof. Jan Axel Nannfeldt). His doctoral thesis, Carpathian Ustilaginales, was published in the academic journal Symbolae Botanicae Upsalienses. Professional mycology In 1986 he obtained a 1-year DFG-scholarship in Germany and worked in the field of smut fungus taxonomy at the University of T√ºbingen, Institute of Botany, Department of Special Botany and Mycology (with Prof. Franz Oberwinkler). As the scholarship was extended successively, he decided to focus his career on mycology rather than medicine. He continued to work at the University until his retirement in 1995. =Publications= By 2014 he had published 232 scientific papers and 10 books on smut fungi. His monograph Smut Fungi of the World, published in 2012 by (APS Press) was described as ‚Äúa culmination of more than 50 years of dedicated work and passion for smut fungi.‚Äù The nearly 1500 page monograph has been described as the \\"Holy Book of Smut Fungi\\", because it comprises the description of the 1700 known species with their synonyms, important literature, their host plants and over 3.500 illustrations of which 650 are the author's drawings of smutted plants. The third edition of his Illustrated Genera of Smut Fungi was published in 2013. In this edition, 104 recognized genera of smut fungi are presented, described and illustrated, compared to the second edition, in which 77 genera are identified. =Collections= Both before and after retirement, V√°nky travelled widely, collecting and investigating smut fungi in about 55 countries all over the world. The collecting trips were very often combined with national or international workshops, conferences or congresses in the field of mycology, where he was lecturer or speaker. Between 1989 and 2009 his German wife, Christine, helped him in collecting and taking photos of smutted plants. Over 60 years V√°nky amassed the largest smut fungus collection in the world, Herbarium Ustilaginales V√°nky (HUV), containing over 22,000 samples. In August 2013 it was relocated to the Queensland Plant Pathology Herbarium, Brisbane, Australia (‚ÄòBRIP‚Äô), and placed at the disposal of the mycological community. V√°nky lectured in Hungary. He donated a complete set (no. 1-1350) of his Smut fungus exsiccata, and several hundreds of duplicates, between them numerous precious isotypes, as well as all of his smut fungus books and publications to the Hungarian Natural History Museum. =Interviews, awards and honours= In June 1996 an interview with V√°nky entitled \\"\\" (A world travelling Sz√©kely botanist) was published in ' (The World of Nature). The Romanian journal ' (Transylvanian Mycologist) published two interviews and a laudation on the Sz√©kely-Hungarian scientist. In 2012 he was awarded the \\"P√°zm√°ny D√©nes Award\\" of the 'K√°lm√°n L√°szl√≥ Mycological Society', Transylvania (Romania). and in 2014 awarded with \\"Arany J√°nos medal\\" of the 'Hungarian Academy of Science'. Two new genera of smut fungi, Vankya and Kalmanago, was named in his honour and several new species Orphanomyces vankyi Savile (1974), Anthracoidea vankyi Nannfeldt (1977), Uromyces vankyorum R.

He was a practicing lawyer for over twenty years, and was active in Maryland politics from 2002 until his death. Over the course of his political career, Shurberg fought for the voting rights of minorities and young people, the civil rights of LGBT individuals, and for pro-choice causes. Shurberg served on the board of Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C Action Fund, and his 2014 campaign for delegate was endorsed by NARAL Maryland Pro-Choice PAC and Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Action Fund, as well as The Gazette. Early life Shurberg was born March 27, 1963 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Wethersfield, Connecticut. In 1981, after graduating from the Kingswood-Oxford School, he moved to Washington D.C. to attend Georgetown University. After graduating from Georgetown in 1985 with a degree in International Politics, Shurberg worked as a paralegal for several years before matriculating to the Washington College of Law at American University. At the Washington College of Law, Shurberg met his future wife, Rebecca Lord, with whom he would move to Silver Spring, Maryland in 1990. Legal career In 1991, after graduating summa cum laude from the Washington College of Law, Shurberg began work as a judicial clerk for Judge Rosalyn B. Bell on the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland. After being admitted to the Maryland State Bar in 1992, he spent several years working for private law firms, with a focus on family law, and opened his own practice in 1996. For over twenty-two years, Shurberg has practiced law in Montgomery County, Maryland, and has focused on serving the legal needs of his community. In 2006, Shurberg represented Congresswoman Donna Edwards in the aftermath of the hotly contested primary election that year. In 2008, when Edwards ran again for the U.S. House of Representatives, he served as both her campaign counsel and chief counsel for election protection efforts, and helped secure her election to the United States House of Representatives. Also in 2006, Shurberg provided pro-bono legal assistance to thirty families facing eviction in the Takoma Park Sligo View Apartment Building. Working in conjunction with Senator Jamie Raskin, Shurberg was able to delay eviction proceedings and allow the tenants to remain in their homes. In 2008, Shurberg won a significant Court of Appeals decision on behalf of a Bethesda, Maryland teenager and her father, restoring the right of Maryland seventeen-year olds to vote in the primary elections if they will be of legal voting age by the time of the general election. As a result of Shurberg's work, the franchise was expanded to over 50,000 young Maryland voters. Less than a year after the case, there were over 12,000 17-year-old voters registered to vote in Maryland. In 2008, Shurberg worked with Equality Maryland to successfully defend Montgomery County citizens against challenges to a gender identity nondiscrimination statute passed earlier in the year.http://maryland- politics.blogspot.com/2009/03/kramer-hit-on-committee-votes.html The statute, which would inspire future nondiscrimination ordinances in Baltimore and Howard County, was challenged in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County by anti-equality activists who wanted to force the statute to be subject to a popular vote. Shurberg argued extensively against the validity of the referendum petition, both before the Circuit Court and the Maryland Court of Appeals. The combined efforts of Shurberg and local LGBT organizations, including the National Center for Transgender Equality, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Lambda Legal, and Human Rights Campaign protected the statute, and would set the precedent for the 2014 passage of the Fairness for All Marylanders Act, a law that amended the state's nondiscrimination statute to include gender identity. He received the Distinguished Service Award by Gay Law for his work. In 2009, Shurberg represented Councilmember Nancy Navarro in the absentee/provisional canvass before the Montgomery County, Maryland Board of Elections in her narrow 2009 special election victory, and again in 2010 before the Federal Election Commission. Later in that year, he also represented Maryland delegates Karen S. Montgomery and Ariana Kelly in the absentee/provisional canvass, following narrow victories in their respective primary elections. Civic leadership and political career In 2002, Shurberg began his career in politics, starting at the local level with a dedication to advancing progressive causes in his community. That year, he served as a campaign volunteer and precinct coordinator for the County Council campaign of current U.S Secretary of Labor Tom Perez. Shurberg's early political activism inspired him to become further involved in Montgomery County's political scene, and he became a Highland View Elementary School PTA representative shortly after his involvement with the Perez campaign. In 2004, Shurberg served as a volunteer election protection attorney for the John Kerry for President campaign, and worked in the battleground state of Ohio. In 2005, Shurberg and his wife Rebecca began hosting an annual event for the Greater Silver Spring, Maryland Democratic Club, introducing them to a number of aspiring political candidates, including future State Senator Jamie Raskin and 2014 Gubernatorial candidate Heather Mizeur. In 2006, Shurberg served as campaign counsel for Raskin's successful state senate campaign, and the same year, aided Mizeur in her successful bid for a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates. During the 2006 General Election, Shurberg was also active in U.S Senator Ben Cardin's first campaign for U.S Senate. In January 2013, Shurberg joined the board of Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C Action fund, the 501(c)4 arm of Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, accepting the seat previously held by his late wife. As a board member, he has worked to elect pro-choice candidates in Virginia, Maryland, and Washington D.C., provided pro-bono legal consultation regarding clinic access and buffer zones, and supported Planned Parenthood's mission to ensure access to low- cost, high quality healthcare services for women and men in the D.C Metropolitan area. Shurberg has been extremely active in community and political organizations over the past twenty years. He was a founding board member, and sits on the steering committee of Progressive Neighbors, a Silver Spring-based political group with a dedication to advancing progressive causes in Montgomery County. He is also Chair of the Legislative Committee for Gender Rights Maryland, an advocacy group focused on aiding \\"in the advancement, achievement and protection of the civil rights of transpeople through electoral involvement, grassroots organizing, coalition building and direct legislative advocacy.\\" Shurberg is a member of both the Bar Association of Montgomery County (BAMC) and the Maryland State Bar Association. =Work in Annapolis= Over the past seven years, Shurberg has testified before the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland State Senate over issues of importance to his community, with a special focus on voting rights. In 2009, despite several court rulings to the contrary, the State Board of Elections proposed what it characterized as a \\"technical amendment\\" to the Election code that would have allowed the Board to permanently remove registered voters from the voter rolls simply because the voter did not respond to a mail notice from the board. Shurberg testified against the bill, HB 1392 (2009) before the Ways and Means Committee, expressing the view that the amendment was entirely unconstitutional. Thanks to his efforts, the bill was referred back to the election law subcommittee, the unconstitutional provisions were removed, and hundreds of thousands of Maryland voters were saved from potential disenfranchisement. Since 2007, Shurberg has served on multiple legislative committees with a wide variety of legislators and activists, working on issues pertaining to same-sex marriage and gender identity nondiscrimination legislation. He has forged solid relationships with members of the Montgomery County delegation, as well as members of the General Assembly from around the state. =2014 delegate race= In 2014, after state delegates Tom Hucker and Heather Mizeur announced that they would not be seeking re-election, Shurberg announced his candidacy for one of the District 20's three delegate seats. He was endorsed by Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington Action Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland PAC, MC NOW PAC, and The Gazette. In April, The Gazette wrote that Shurberg and the other endorsees \\"built reputations of substantive achievement, and offer the best potential for effective state representation\\" =Maryland Scramble= Logo for Maryland Scramble In March 2015, shortly after Senator Barbara Mikulski announced that she would not be seeking re-election to the United States Senate, Shurberg created Maryland Scramble, a political blog with a special focus on Maryland politics. Personal life Shurberg resided in Silver Spring, Maryland, with his family. He has two sons, Eli (born 1994) and Ethan (born 2000). His wife, Rebecca Lord, died in 2012 after a battle with thyroid cancer. Despite her illness, Lord was active in local politics, earned a PhD in Latin American history at the University of Maryland, and sat on the board of Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C Action Fund (PPMWAF).

Three Allied warships, which had already established control off the coast of Brittany and were lurking off Audierne south of the invested fortress of Brest, intercepted and sank eight German vessels of an armed convoy. This was the conclusion of Operation Kinetic; an allied plan to intercept shipping and hinder Germans besieged at Brest. Background By 11 August, the Mortain counter-offensive had ground to a halt. To the east, US forces took Argentan on 13 August while British and Canadian forces closed in toward Falaise from the north, thus initiating the drive to encircle and destroy two German armies inside the Falaise Pocket. As the siege of the Breton ports continued, the focus of the war was quickly shifting further east.German pg. 161 Operation Kinetic had been set up by the Royal Navy Command Headquarters; the objective of which was to eliminate the German navy all along the French Atlantic ports.Paterson pg 264 Of three Forces of Kinetic - Force 27 under the command of William Davis, consisting of the light cruiser HMS Mauritius and the destroyers HMS Ursa and HMCS Iroquois, departed Plymouth on 13 August to carry out a new patrol along the central section of the Biscay coast. With the Germans under the command of Marinegruppenkommando West on the move to evacuate by sea, the ongoing Kinetic had already scored two successes and was finalizing for the naval offensive in the Bay of Biscay to complete the success. On the night of 22/23 August, under orders from naval intelligence the cruiser HMS Mauritius and the destroyers HMCS Iroquois and HMS Ursa were patrolling Audierne Bay between Brest and Lorient and radar soon picked up a large contact heading towards them. Battles Davis ordered Iroquois; the ship closest to the contact, commanded by James Calcutt Hibbard to use the Type 293 radar and relay the information to the rest of the force. Hibbard placed so much confidence in the radar that he decided to direct the opening moves from the Action Information Centre rather than the bridge, and then gave the order to illuminate with star shell. As a result, Force 27 was able to close undetected and launched a surprise attack on the known convoy which were three ships. HMCS Iroquois going in to torpedo one of the German ships driven aground At 0213 Iroquois scored the first hit on flak ship, which was subsequently set on fire. A second flak ship was quickly destroyed by the heavy guns from Mauritius, while another was set on fire and driven onto the shoals. Only nineteen minutes after opening fire, all three German ships had been put out of action, with two sunk and the third aground and burning. Radar plotters Able Seamen William Ewasiuk and Harry Henderson of HMCS Iroquois, 21 August 1944 In a second action two hours later, Iroquois detected another convoy of four ships departing from the harbour of Brest: an M-class minesweeper, two flak ships and a converted mine-destructor ship, or \\"Sperrbrecher\\". Using the radar on Iroquois again, Force 27 stalked the convoy at long range until 0408, when the German ships were illuminated with star shell. Upon opening fire, the British and Canadians quickly overwhelmed the convoy sinking two vessels and causing two others to collide in the confusion and burst into flames as they raced for shore, with surviving crew members jumping over the side as they went. One of these vessels capsized and sank while the other drove onto the rocks at full speed and exploded. At dawn, Force 27 continued with another sweep around Audierne Bay in order to confirm the destruction of the German convoy. In the process a minesweeper came into view and was pounded with gunfire and driven onto a reef near Port Audierne. Iroquois finished off the minesweeper with a torpedo, while Ursa sent on a boarding party onto the other grounded vessel to grab eleven prisoners. The other one hundred and fifty survivors who were able to swim to shore were subsequently taken prisoner by the French Resistance. This was the last part of the action and the force consolidated and reviewed the damage they had caused. Aftermath The final tally for the night was eight ships destroyed: one minesweeper driven ashore and heavily damaged, a flak ship, five armed trawlers, and the Sperrbrecher. Iroquois alone had fired a total of 1,197 rounds of 4.7-inch along with 231 rounds of star shell. Davis in his report attributed the success of the night's action to two principal causes: \\"some lucky guesses, and the excellence of Iroquois' radar and plotting teams\\". Although not known to Davis, it was actually Ultra intelligence that bore some responsibility for the luck of those guesses. In the last week of August, another naval operation commenced, this time called Operation Assault, during which the cruiser HMS Bellona patrolled along the Biscay coast from Belle Isle near Lorient to Arcachon Point, south-west of Bordeaux. Continuing these sweeps through the remainder of the month, the Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy patrolled off the coast. They sent landing parties ashore on the French mainland and outlying islands to secure them and ensured they were eliminated as potential bases of logistical supply to the Germans. The blockade of these Biscay ports, however, achieved impressive results independent of the campaign on land. By the close of the Operation Kinetic, the combined Allied naval and air offensive eventually resulted in the reorganization of Kriegsmarine forces operating from fortress ports along the coast into Marineoberkommando West.

They are intruded by basalts and rhyolites of Mesozoic to Cenozoic age. In contrast, the western part of the island is formed from sedimentary rocks of Carboniferous to Quaternary age. Archean rocks occur from the northeast portion of the island down to the south in the Ranotsara shear zone. Rocks in the northern portion of Madagascar are greenstone belts, from the Archean or Paleoproterozoic age. Summary The center and eastern portions of the island consist primarily of metamorphic and igneous Precambrian basement granites, migmatites, and schists, ranging in age from 3 billion to 550 million years old. They are mostly overlain by laterite clays. The Itremo Massif consists of quartzite and marble outcrops 630 million years in age. The Morondava, Mahajanga and Ambilobe sedimentary basins occur along the western third of the island, and consist of terrestrial deposits that range in age from 350 million years ago to recent times. The western margins of Madagascar include Mesozoic and Tertiary limestones. These outcrop in the Ankarana and Bemaraha Massifs, Namoroka, Analamerana, and Ankara Plateau (172-162 million years in age), and the Mahafaly Plateau (54-38 million years in age) respectively. Flood basalts that ring Madagascar include the Mahajanga lavas (87.6 to 88.5 million years in age), the Toliara lavas and Ejeda-Bekily dike swarm (84.5-84.8 million years old), and the Androy lava flow (84.4 million years in age). These igneous rocks were emplaced during the interval when India and Madagascar were together (91 million years ago), and when apart (84 million years ago). More recent volcanic activity includes the formation of the Ankaratra Massif over the past 5 million years, and Montagne d'Ambre, which erupted from 50 to 2 million years ago.  Tectonics  A NW-SE trending sinistral shear belt separates northern and southern crustal terranes. The Ampanihy ductile shear zone was created by flattening events associated with granulite metamorphism, isoclinal folding, flattened sheaths, steep to vertical foliations and sheath-like geometry of massif-type anorthosite bodies.  Paleontology  The Maevarano Formation, dated to late Maastrichtian age, has provided a diverse faunal assemblage, including the giant frog Beelzebufo, gondwanathere mammals, dinosaurs, crocodylians and other groups. The Middle Jurassic Isalo III Formation contains fossil dinosaurs. Typical Gondwanan flora of Glossopteris is found in the Permian formations in Madagascar.  Economic geology  Madagascar is the world's leading producer of many colored gemstones, including sapphires, rubies, multi-coloured tourmalines, emeralds, amethysts, cordierites, aquamarines and garnets. Madagascar is also a major source of graphite, making it the second- largest producer in Africa. Additionally, Madagascar is Africa's third leading producer of chromite. Titanium oxide is found in significant quantities in beach sands located near Toalagnaro, however, 75% of the coastal forest zone in that area would have to be destroyed in order to exploit it, which has not been done. Huge oil fields lie to the west of Madagascar, however they would require steam injection to extract, which is both technologically difficult and expensive. The oil fields of Tsimiroro and Bemolanga are estimated to hold combined reserves of 11.5 billion barrels.

It is based on multiple choice (MCQ) of general knowledge.  Gameplay  Two contestants, working as a team, must correctly answer 7 general knowledge questions, each having 4 possible answers, to win ‚Ç¨1,000 or ‚Ç¨100,000. 30 buzzers are arranged in front of them and illuminate when pressed, randomly either green, or red, or golden yellow. 10 prizes of ‚Ç¨100,000 and 10 prizes of ‚Ç¨1,000 are at stake. Of the 30 buzzers : * 10 green buzzers remove a wrong answer. * 10 golden buzzers eliminate a potential prize of ‚Ç¨100,000. * 10 red buzzers eliminate a potential prize of ‚Ç¨1,000. When contestants are unable to answer a question, they can search for a green buzzer to remove a wrong answer. During this search, contestants can also uncover: * Some golden buzzers, eliminating desirable prizes (‚Ç¨100,000). * Some red buzzers, eliminating less desirable prizes (‚Ç¨1,000). When a green buzzer is found, the host asks what are the 2 answers between which they are hesitating. Contestants will select, of course, the 2 answers that they consider the most plausible. One of those answers is wrong. Therefore, an incorrect, but plausible, answer is withdrawn (however, nothing guarantees that the other un-eliminated answer is the correct answer, because contestants may not have indicated the correct answer among the 2 answers that they consider most plausible). Therefore, there are still 3 answers to choose from and contestants have as many seconds to answer as there remain unused buzzers. When contestants can answer a question without the help of the buzzers, 2 red buzzers are removed. A life-line, the \\"Give and Take\\" is available once per episode: It provides the answer, but removes 2 golden buzzers. If the 7 questions are answered correctly, the remaining green buzzers are removed and the contestants choose a final buzzer. Tension is strong until the end, as they do not know if they will finally find a golden buzzer (and a prize of ‚Ç¨100,000) or a red buzzer (and a prize of ‚Ç¨1,000).

Music is by Rodolfo Sciammarella and cinematography by Hugo Chiesa. The film was released in Argentina on 8 July 1941. It stars Luis Arata, Severo Fern√°ndez and Alberto Bello. Synopsis A retired sea captain is profoundly bored. His sons hope to wake him up by staging a fake treasure hunt. This turns into a difficult journey to the R√≠o de la Plata islands. The family are unaware that their backyard holds a valuable oil well. The farce is fast-paced, only slightly hampered by a romantic subplot. Reception El Mundo said the film achieved some popular comic effect. Although void of any cinematographic merit, the dynamism of its action could not be denied. The show was amusing. Manrupe and Portela said of the film that it was a simple work derived from a farce, but there were some moments of humor from a runaway Luis Arata and an insufferable Severo Fern√°ndez.

Essing was born in Dirkshorn, a small village near Schagen in North Holland. His father was a gemeentesecretaris, formerly the head of a municipality's civil servants, and later became mayor of Blokker. In 1956, he was a law student and the president of the local Catholic youth club; to raise money for the club he got the Dutch Swing College Band, at the time the best-known Dixieland band in the country, to play in Op Hoop van Zegen, Blokker's auction hall‚Äîhis father was the president of the auction. In years following, other major acts to play there included Benny Goodman, Victor Silvester, and Cliff Richard. Louis Armstrong, in 1959, was perhaps the biggest international artist Essing got to play in Blokker until The Beatles, as a fundraiser for the youth club's club house. Essing, only 25 at the time, raised money from local farmers to pay Armstrong, who canceled two shows elsewhere to come to Blokker and was apparently quite touched by the idea. He commented afterward, \\"They didn't seem to know my music, but they were terribly grateful that I came. Man, I hope those kids get their clubhouse\\". Armstrong and his orchestra played for four hours but were asked to stop: it was getting late and the town did not have accommodations for the ten thousand people who had come from all over the Netherlands and Belgium. His biggest coup was, undoubtedly, engaging The Beatles for two shows on 6 June 1964. As part of their 1964 world tour, which supported the release of A Hard Day's Night, they spent three days in the Netherlands, a stay that included a (playback) concert for television and a boat tour of the Amsterdam canals. For this leg of the world tour Ringo Starr, who had collapsed during a photo shoot, had been replaced by Jimmie Nicol. Essing paid 40,000 guilders for the band to play two shows, of 24 minutes and 8 songs each. The event continues to live on in the local imagination: a Beatles in Blokker monument was raised in 1999, and in 2014 the fiftieth anniversary was celebrated with an exhibition. After The Beatles, Essing founded a booking agency for dance orchestras in Alkmaar, and had a brief and disappointing career in real estate. He returned to booking shows and organizing events, including a number of very successful fundraisers for Dutch television. After being implicated in supposed irregularities with the proceeds from such an event in 1974, he left the Netherlands for Belgium, returning for another event in 1989. When he died in Alkmaar in 1994, he had been mostly forgotten.

Career Early in his career, McNair worked a number of jobs, including caseworker at a homeless shelter. He also worked to help those in his neighborhood, holding frequent fundraisers and serving food at a local Salvation Army shelter. The Peekskill, N.Y., native was well known in his community where he was often seen volunteering at his local church or playing host to The Original Uncle Jimmy Mack's Amateur Hour, a recurring fundraising event that helped to showcase local comedic talent. McNair left the construction industry to pursue comedy, an effort that was grueling and paid little; but did put him in touch with other aspiring entertainers at, among other places, the Uptown Comedy Club in Harlem where he would meet Tracy Morgan. When Morgan later joined the cast of Saturday Night Live, McNair would often write sketches and material for the show in a freelance capacity. He was traveling with the comedy troupe the night of his death to aid with the writing for Morgan's \\"Turn it Funny\\" comedy stand-up tour. Mentorship According to the New York Daily News, McNair was a close friend and mentor to Morgan.

Synopsis  The plot concerns a motherless teenaged Anglo-Irish gentleman of the 1890s whose father has been forced to flee the country. Left in charge of the family estates, he uses his freedom to indulge his love of field sports, focusing especially on wildfowl-shooting on a nearby peat bog. There is an extended chapter narrating a magnificent fox hunt, whose trophy, the brush, forms the focus of a poignant moment in the coda, in the narrator's old age. When he discovers that the existence of the bog is threatened by an industrial peat-cutting syndicate he finds no effective ally except an old woman who believes herself to be a \\"wise woman\\", or witch. The syndicate is defeated either by her occult powers or by the unaided forces of nature, just as the reader chooses to believe.  Composition  Elements of the book had been in Dunsany's mind for some years before he finally came to write it, but it was only repeated encouragement from his wife that finally led him to write the novel. She also induced him to add some love interest to the story. The process of composition, when it finally came, only took 15 weeks, from February to May 1933. The Curse of the Wise Woman was published later that year by William Collins.  Reception  The book received excellent reviews on its first publication, and was chosen by John Masefield to receive the Harmsworth Award for the best work of imaginative prose by an Irish author. It stayed in print for some twenty years, and was reprinted in 1972. In his introduction to a 1976 reissue Dennis Wheatley said that it would \\"appeal to those who love shooting, hunting and magnificent descriptions of the beauties of nature\\". Mark Amory, writing in 1972, called it \\"now the best-known and loved of all his work\\"; he noted that the author's prose was here \\"eloquent but under control\\", and that it had \\"a feeling for the country and country people\\". The Dunsany scholar Darrell Schweitzer considered it his finest novel. He felt that the Irish countryside \\"comes across so vividly that the reader is all but transported there\\", but he nevertheless emphasised the importance of its otherworldly elements: \\"between the finest magical cursing and conjuring scenes Dunsany ever wrote and the vision of Tir-nan-Og, the book has the feel of the purest fantasy\\". Both critics were agreed in calling it an unusually autobiographical Dunsany novel. S. T. Joshi called The Curse of the Wise Woman Dunsany's most unified novel, while an anonymous Kirkus reviewer offered the contrary opinion that it fell between the two schools of mysticism and rustic realism.  Reprint  In 2014 Valancourt Books brought The Curse of the Wise Woman back into print with a new introduction by Mark Valentine.

Recording Sunbathing Animal was recorded in 2013, over the course of three sessions. The first of these sessions yielded the EP, Tally All the Things That You Broke (2013), with vocalist and guitarist Austin Brown stating, ‚ÄúWe had to kind of squeeze [recording] in between long runs of touring; whenever we had a couple of weeks off, we‚Äôd try to arrange a few days in the studio. The first session more or less produced the EP that we put out last year, Tally All the Things That You Broke; that was all brand new stuff, that we just laid down and got out right off the bat. We had a few more songs back then that we saved for the record, and we put all of it down later last year. It wasn't a stretch at all; we were never rushing to get anything finished.\\" Writing and composition The band began writing material for Sunbathing Animal shortly after recording its predecessor, Light Up Gold (2012), with vocalist and guitarist Austin Brown noting: \\"The truth is, we've been writing new material ever since we wrapped the last one up. If anything, we took our time\\". Many of the album's lyrics were written whilst on tour in support of Light Up Gold, with Brown stating: \\"There‚Äôs a few prevailing themes going on, but the major one kind of involves a duality between freedom and captivity; that balance between the freedom that you find in being in a band - or just being a creative person in the world, that‚Äôs trying to leave their mark - and then the captivity that goes along with the constraints that you come up against when you‚Äôre trying to make shit work, and a lot of the time having it fail. I think [vocalist and guitarist] Andrew [Savage] saw that dichotomy in the story behind the title, and it works well in that respect, because it runs all the way through the record.\\" Brown later elaborated, stating that the album's lyrical content is its most important aspect: \\"When we started out to make this record, the focus was ‚Äì more than ever ‚Äì on the lyrics. They came first in the process and are meant to be right at the front, so that you‚Äôre forced to listen to them. I mean, I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a hook or chorus on the whole record; but that forces the audience to create their own, depending on which lyric pops out to them ‚Äì so in its own way it becomes the chorus.‚Äù  Critical reception  Sunbathing Animal received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 78, based on 35 reviews. Rolling Stone magazine's Rob Sheffield said the band has evolved musically since Light Up Gold, while Robert Christgau wrote in Cuepoint that \\"Andrew Savage has succeeded at composing songs with distinct hooks at differing lengths and tempos and constructing an album that reveals more goodies the more you play it.\\" In a less enthusiastic review, Lanre Bakare of The Guardian felt their \\"twitchy garage-rock tales\\" about alienated characters make the album sound monotonous. Pitchfork placed the album at 140 on their list of \\"The 200 Best Albums of the 2010s\\".

Medal of Honor presented to each of the First Defenders Letter from Samuel R. Russel to Col. Bosbyshell regarding First Defender uniform History After the Confederate States opened fire on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation on April 15, calling 75,000 militia to suppress the rebellion. The first volunteer troops reached Washington, D.C. on April 18, 1861 at 6:00pm. These first troops were the Pennsylvania First Defenders and consisted of 476 officers and men. The troops were quartered in hallways and committee rooms of the United States Senate and House of Representatives. At 9:00pm that evening, the troops were brought into the basement of the Capitol where they were distributed government arms and ammunition. President Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of State, William H. Seward, and the Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, were present as the arms were being distributed. During this time, President Lincoln proceeded down the line to shake hands with every member of the companies.Thompson 1910, p. 15. Casualties En route to Washington, D.C, the troops boarded a train at Camden Station in Baltimore, Maryland ‚Äì the largest city of that Slave state. In a prelude to the Baltimore Riot of 1861 that occurred a day later, they were met with an angry mob of pro-South sympathizers who threw bricks and stones at them. Many of the men received serious wounds as a result of the confrontation. Among them was sixty-five-year-old Nicholas Biddle of the Washington Artillerists who is believed to be one of the first men to shed blood in the American Civil War. As an African American in uniform, Biddle likely stood out as an easy target to the Southerners and suffered a head wound which was serious enough to expose his bone.Lossing 1866, p. 406 Recognition In December 1864, members of the Washington Artillerists Frances P.

Background German periodical Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung describes him as \\"one of the most important heads of the Syrian opposition against the government in Damascus\\". Biography He was born in 1978 in Hama and graduated from Aleppo University in the field of English literature. He was imprisoned in Sednaya Prison for four years between 2007 and 2011 until he was released as part of an amnesty following the commencement of uprisings in Syria. He served as the head of the political council in the rebel union Islamic Front. In December 2013, he gave an interview to Al Jazeera's Sami Zeidan, in which he discussed his organisation's objectives and Syria's future. He stated that his group's ultimate aim was to establish an Islamic state in Syria, which represented the long suppressed aspiration of the Syrian people. Concerning the Geneva peace talks he stated that it did not represent his group, which had not participated therein, and that they viewed it as a plot to derail the Syrian Revolution from its objectives. Death On 9 September 2014 he was killed along with 45 other rebel leaders in a bomb attack that targeted a secret meeting in an underground hideaway in Ram Hamdan, rural Northern Idlib. There are controversies around the nature and the perpetrators of the attack. Based on witnesses of the dead corpses, a sophisticated gas attack is suggested. Whereas some people mention a suicide bomber. The Islamic State (ISIL) has been forwarded responsible for the attack; however, some circles suggest the involvement of the United Arab Emirates. Others have speculated that his death may have been an accident in a weapons workshop in the complex he was in, or possible involvement from Western intelligence agencies, or that the attack was carried out by a rebel rival of Ahrar al-Sham, or by al-Nusra to weaken Ahrar al-Sham.

However he ran out of money and fell out with Glandore, and with neither patronage nor money he was unable to contest the 1806 general election. A legacy and the support of Lord Ventry secured his re-election in 1812, and he held the seat until 1826.

Weinstein, the band's frontman and a professor of political science at Purdue University, as well as well-known music critic Jim DeRogatis (who remains the band's drummer). The band was named after the Vorticist movement of the early 20th-century, a group of artists and writers whose basic tenet was the \\"perpetuate violent structures of adolescent clarity\\" throughout life. (As DeRogatis puts it, \\"To live with the lust for life of a teenager, no matter what age you are--a great definition of rock 'n' roll half a century before it happened.\\") The group (completed by guitarist Tony Tavano, aka G Haad, and bassist Chris Martiano, aka Johnny Los, who replaced early member Randy Kertz) initially released two albums with Weinstein, pairing its music to his lyrics: Take the System Down, and God Won't Bless America, both on the independent Thick Records. Several other independent recordings followed with Weinstein before he left the group in 2009; he died at age 73 in 2015 but the group continues as a trio. Reception Their sound has been described as eclectic, and they have been compared to the Dead Kennedys, Wire and the Butthole Surfers. In particular, some critics have drawn comparisons between Weinstein's demeanor in live performances to Jello Biafra's persona. John Petkovic of the Cleveland Plain Dealer described the sound of God Won't Bless America as \\"a mix of both - music and cheerleading, that is.\\" The Columbus Dispatch said that \\"Musically, they fall into the netherlands where metal, 'Oi' punk, hard core and Mr. Bungle tread\\". Monica Kendrick of the Chicago Reader wrote of the 2005 album \\"Warzone\\" that it is \\"mean, tight, righteously pissed, and full of hooky, nasty sloganeering choruses--and if you're like me you might relish the frisson of hearing yourself chanting them. Of the current trio, the Webzine Razorcake wrote, \\"\\"The brevity of the Ramones, with an occasional Big Black abrasiveness, and the aggressiveness of Dead Boys.\\" History Weinstein joined Vortis in 2000 when his wife introduced him to several musicians several decades his juniors from Chicago. Weinstein also went by the stage name \\"Fellow Traveler\\" when performing with Vortis, though the band and many fans affectionately referred to him as \\"the Professor.\\" The group released its debut album, Take the System Down, on Thick Records in 2002, followed by God Won't Bless America the following year, also on Thick Records. The group continued for some time as a quartet after Weinstein left the band, with Louie Calvano joining and alternating on guitar and bass with Martiniano. Several more indie recordings followed, then Martiniano left as well to pursue his scholarly studies of William Blake, and the band has been a trio ever since, with Tavano, DeRogatis, and Calvano gigging frequently in and around Chicago. Most of the songs are now written as a group, maintaining the political and sociological edge inspired by Weinstein, but with a short, sharp aesthetic that owes a debt to Wire and Chicago punk avatars such as Naked Raygun, as well as Husker Du. The band's latest album was released by the vinyl-only Cavetone Records label. in Spring 2019. This Machine Kills Fascists is also streaming on Spotify, Bandcamp, and iTunes, and in addition to the title's nod to Woody Guthrie and a reinterpretation of a song he wrote about Fred Trump, lyrics reference and draw inspiration from George Orwell and Bill McKibben.

She was the sister of the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer and daughter of author Johanna Schopenhauer. Henriette Sommer and Adrian van der Venne were pseudonyms used by her.  Life and work  Johanna and Adele Schopenhauer (as a child), 1806. Painting by Caroline Bardua. Residence and business office of the Schopenhauer family until 1805, located at New Wandrahm 92, Hamburg (since demolished, today Speicherstadt) Papercut self-portrait Adele Schopenhauer was born in Hamburg to Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer, a businessman, and his wife Johanna. She grew up in Weimar under the influence of a circle of artists and scholars who gathered in the literary salon run by her mother, but she received no formal education. She was highly gifted and engaged in literature and poetry. She not only wrote fairy tales, poems, and novels, but was also a talented papercut artist. Both her papercuts and her literary contributions have been recognized and appreciated, especially in the English-speaking world. She was sociable and likable but her love interests were unrequited and she never married.  Loss of assets in 1819  In May 1819, the Danzig banking house Muhl collapsed. Johanna and Adele Schopenhauer had deposited all the money they had inherited upon Heinrich Schopenhauer's death in 1805 in that bank, and thus lost a large part of their assets when the bank collapsed. Arthur Schopenhauer had wisely left only one-third of his assets in Muhl and was not willing to engage in a settlement with Muhl. This incident led to a further deterioration of the relationship between the two women and Arthur, because they repeatedly sent him letters, in vain, asking him to approve the settlement. The further development of the lawsuit proved Arthur right. Mother and daughter settled on an agreement with a 70% loss and lost most of their wealth. Arthur, however, waited and refused to cash in his promissory notes. Muhl, who was considered a shrewd tactician, tried till the end to get Arthur to agree to a settlement with the generous offer of a 70% asset return plus a flock of sheep. But when Muhl recovered financially and again became solvent, Arthur was able to get his entire money back some years later. A close friend of Goethe's daughter- in-law Ottilie (de), Adele Schopenhauer often visited Goethe's house in Weimar. She was known to have called Goethe \\"father\\", and he praised her abilities. This loss of wealth was not without drastic consequences. Although Johanna could make some earnings through her writing career and Adele retained some residual assets because she was protected in part by her immaturity, the lifestyle of the Schopenhauer women in the 1820s was very different from that of earlier years. This is also apparent from a letter Adele wrote 17 years after the loss, in which she speaks of \\"false prosperity\\".  Move to Bonn  Due to the change of circumstances in Weimar and their unfavorable financial situation, the standing of the Schopenhauers in Weimar apparently dropped. Adele was able, in 1828, to persuade her mother Johanna to move to Bonn. They could not initially afford to live year-round in Bonn, so they temporarily moved to Unkel, a cheaper city. In Bonn, Adele was a close friend of Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff and of Sibylle Mertens-Schaaffhausen. After her mother's death in 1838, Schopenhauer travelled a lot, mostly to Italy, until she finally returned to Bonn, seriously ill, where she died in 1849 and was buried on Goethe's 100th birthday. Her friend Sibylle Mertens-Schaaffhausen made a touching epitaph in Italian. Four days after Schopenhauer's funeral, Mertens- Schaaffhausen held a private memorial service, following a pattern from classical antiquity, in her garden on Wilhelmstra√üe. Adele Schopenhauer's grave is located in the old cemetery in Bonn.  Literary works  * Anna. Ein Roman aus der n√§chsten Vergangenheit [Anna: A novel from the most recent past]. Parts 1‚Äì2.

As a publicly traded company with over $3.5 billion in revenue, the company owns two subsidiaries: Mode Transportation (formerly Exel Transportation Services), a third party logistics company (Unyson); and Hub Group Trucking, which provides intermodal freight transport and drayage services. Hub Group was founded in 1971 by Phillip Yeager. The company went public in 1996 and is traded on the NASDAQ exchange. David Yeager, son of Phillip Yeager, serves as Hub Group chairman and chief executive officer. The company is headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois. History In 1971, Phillip and Joyce founded Hub Group (then known as Hub City Terminals) in Hinsdale, Illinois. The company was started with $10,000 and was located in a windowless, one-room office above a flower shop. The 43-year-old Phillip Yeager quit his job at the Pennsylvania Railroad, where he had worked for 19 years, to create Hub Group. At the time of its formation, Hub City Terminals worked as a shipper's agent, which was an intermediary that booked intermodal transportation with railroads. In 1975, Yeager and his wife set up a series of S corporations to expand their business. Each office operated separately and had its own profit and loss center. Hub City Terminals was renamed Hub Group in 1985. In 1995, David Yeager became chief executive officer of Hub Group. He had been with the company since 1975, when he opened the company's Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania regional office. David Yeager had become co-chairman of the company in 1992. In 1996, Hub Group held an initial public offering. A year later, in 1997, the company became the first intermodal marketing company to top $1 billion in yearly revenue. Hub Group had 34 regional offices by 1998, when the company borrowed $100 million to begin purchasing all outstanding minority interests in the company's regional offices. The company moved from a geography-based operation with multiple regional offices to a centralized operation with a single profit and loss center headquartered in Lombard, Illinois in 2004. The reorganization effort allowed Hub Group to compete as a single network. Mark Yeager was appointed president and chief operating officer in April 2005. Yeager had joined Hub Group in 1992 and served as president of the company's field operations immediately prior to his appointment. Yeager succeeded Thomas Hardin, who had served as Hub Group president since 1985. Hub Group acquired Memphis, Tennessee-based drayage company Comtrak Logistics for $48 million in 2006. The two companies had worked together for over 20 years by the time of the acquisition. The deal included Comtrak's client lists and proprietary transportation tracking software. Comtrak founder and Chief Executive Officer Mike Bruns was retained as head of Hub Group's Comtrak Logistics subsidiary, now named Hub Group Trucking. Hub Group founder and Chairman Phillip Yeager died in October 2008 from complications following a heart attack. Yeager was 80 years old. Company CEO David Yeager became chairman of Hub Group in November 2008. In 2011, the company acquired Exel Transportation Services, a third-party logistics provider, for $83 million. Hub Group renamed the subsidiary Mode Transportation. Exel Transportation President James Damman was retained by Hub Group to lead Mode Transportation and the subsidiary remained located in Dallas, Texas. Hub Group moved its headquarters from Downers Grove to Oak Brook in January 2013. At that time, the four-story, 140,000 square- foot building was the first new office building built in Oak Brook in over a decade. The new corporate headquarters is LEED Gold certified. On August 8, 2015, Mark Yeager resigned as president and chief operating officer. In September 2015, Hub Group appointed Donald Maltby as Yeager's successor. Maltby previously served as Chief Supply Chain Officer from January 2011 until May 2014. Phillip D. Yeager became President and chief operating officer on May 30, 2019. Operations Hub Group is organized into two segments: Mode Transportation and Hub. Both segments offer intermodal, logistics and truck brokerage services. The company's logistics business operates under the Unyson name. As of December 2015, Hub Group Trucking performed services for 75 percent of Hub Group's drayage needs.

Smith, Scots-English/English-Scots Dictionary (Hippocrene Practical Dictionary), 1998, p102. Sain is cognate with the Irish and Scottish Gaelic seun and sian and the Old Irish s√©n - \\"a protective charm.\\"Black, Ronald, The Gaelic Otherworld, 2005, p136-7, 211Carmichael, Alexander, Carmina Gadelica Volume II, 1900, p26-37Macbain, Etymological Dictionary of Scottish- Gaelic, 1998, p309. Traditional saining rites may involve water that has been blessed in some fashion, or the smoke from burning juniper, accompanied by spoken prayers or poetry. Saining can also refer to less formal customs like making religious signs to protect against evil, such as the sign of the cross. In Shetland, the Scottish folklorist F. Marian McNeil refers to the custom of making the sign of Thor's hammer to sain the goblet that was passed around at New Year's celebrations. An old Hogmanay (New Year's) custom in the Highlands of Scotland, which has survived to a small extent and seen some degree of revival, is to celebrate Hogmanay with the saining of the household and livestock. Early on New Year's morning, householders drink and then sprinkle 'magic water' from 'a dead and living ford' around the house (a 'dead and living ford' refers to a river ford that is routinely crossed by both the living and the dead). After the sprinkling of the water in every room, on the beds and all the inhabitants, the house is sealed up tight and branches of juniper are set on fire and carried throughout the house and byre. The juniper smoke is allowed to thoroughly fumigate the buildings until it causes sneezing and coughing among the inhabitants. Then all the doors and windows are flung open to let in the cold, fresh air of the new year. The woman of the house then administers 'a restorative' from the whisky bottle, and the household sits down to its New Year breakfast. Saining with juniper was also used in healing rites, where the evil eye was suspected to be the cause of the illness, but it apparently fell out of use by the end of the nineteenth century after a young girl with respiratory problems suffocated due to the amount of smoke that filled the house. Saining is a common practice in modern traditions based on Scottish folklore, such as blessing and protecting children and other family members. While many of the surviving saining prayers and charms are Christian in nature, others that focus on the powers of nature are used as part of Gaelic Polytheist ceremonies.Loughlin, Annie \\"Saining\\" at Tairis UK.

The line is in the planning stages and the transit agency Ruter is working towards connecting it to the Oslo Metro. The line has at various stages been proposed as an automated people mover, tram-train, tramway, light rail, stadtbahn, rapid transit, bus rapid transit and commuter rail. The current proposal consists of a metro line starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for . It would possible have a station at Madserud, and then stations at Sk√∏yen, V√¶ker√∏, Lysaker, Telenor Arena, Flyt√•rnet and Fornebu Senter. A depot would be built at Fornebu and the line would connect to the metro's Common Tunnel at Majorstuen. Plans for a light rail to Fornebu were first launched in 1919, but at the time there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the Drammen Line. A 1986 report from said agency also looked at a people mover to a proposed new terminal. In 1992 Parliament voted to close the airport and build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Fornebu closed in 1998 and the area was to enter into a period of redevelopment. However, the zoning plans state that full-scale development of 6,000 residences and between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs cannot take place until a rail transit has been established. After discarding proposals for a railway and a tram-train, Akershus County Municipality planned a people mover to Lysaker Station. This was approved of in 2004, but in 2007 the county changed its opinion and instead opted for a connection to the Oslo Tramway, allowing direct access to the city center. Ruter took over the planning in 2008 and followed up with additional reports. It instead recommended that the site be served by a metro. It cited that estimates showed that no other transit systems will have sufficient capacity in the long run. The project is estimated to cost 4.5 billion Norwegian krone, but there is no fixed schedule for construction. History 1919 proposal for a suburban light rail through Fornebu The first proposals for a line to Fornebu arose as part of a 1917 competition issued by Christiana (later Oslo) and Aker Municipality to plan a new rail transport plan for the capital area. The winning design, made by J√∏rgen Barth, included a series of suburban lines.Haldsrud (2013): 27 One of these was a branch from the Lilleaker Line past Lysaker, through Fornebu and onwards to Snar√∏ya and Ost√∏ya.Haldsrud (2013): 30 At the time Fornebu was a largely unpopulated area, while there was a small population at Snar√∏ya. Fornebu and Snar√∏ya received a coach service in 1921.Wisting (1989): 22‚Äì26 During the 1930s the water aerodrome Gressholmen Airport became insufficient to meet Oslo's aviation needs, and it was decided that Fornebu would become the site of an airport. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened on 1 June 1939.Wisting (1989): 35‚Äì41 Finnair and Scandinavian Airlines aircraft at Oslo Airport, Fornebu in 1971, including two Sud Aviation Caravelles, a Douglas DC-9 and a Douglas DC-8 Transit to the airport was organized through a series of concessions which were issued to individual bus companies. From 1975 local buses were coordinated through Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk. Airport coach services to the city center were on the other hand granted to the largest airlines, Braathens SAFE and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). They operated each their coach service from two separate locations downtown. Various improvements to this system were proposed, including check-in in the city center.Berthelsen (1981): 5 The coach and bus services were generally regarded as little attractive and forty percent of passengers at the airport used taxis.Berthelsen (1981): 6 Fornebu was at the time still considered an option for a future main airport for Eastern Norway and there were therefore proposal to build an airport rail link.Berthelsen (1981): 7 Meanwhile, there was a political debate regarding the site of a new airport. Fornebu was one alternative. However, it only had a single runway, which was too small to serve intercontinental flights. It would therefore have to serve in tandem with Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other proposals were placing the airport at Hurum, √Ös and Hob√∏l, or building a new airport at Gardermoen.Bredal (1998): 17 The Norwegian State Railways developed a series of plans for the various airport locations, including the Hurum Line, the Gardermoen Line‚Äîwhich was ultimately built‚Äîand branches of the √òstfold Line to Hob√∏l and √Ös. The ground transport system was a major part of the considerations and proposals were made both for motorway and railway access to all the alternatives.Norwegian State Railways (1986): 1 As part of its 1986 proposal NSB also launched the concept of a people mover to the airport.Norwegian State Railways (1986): 15 Construction of the airport was to be carried out by a separate limited company owned by the Civil Aviation Administration. Hence the airport was financed using state grants which would be repaid. A similar model was used for roads and railways, in which a separate subsidiary of NSB would be set up to build new railway lines.Bredal (1998): 39 Parliament voted on 8 June 1988 in favor of building a new airport at Hurum.Bredal (1998): 23‚Äì24 A series of weather surveys were then published which showed unfavorable conditions and the matter was again brought up for political consideration. A final decision to build a new airport at Gardermoen was thus taken on 8 October 1992 and subsequently closing Fornebu.Bredal (1998): 28 Aerial view of the peninsula Lysaker Station was the closest railway station to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. From 27 May 1990, SAS and NSB started a cooperation to better the connection between rail and airline services. The project included the station being branded as Lysaker/Fornebu and dedicated shuttle buses running from the station to the airport terminal. NSB changed their scheduled so all InterCity Express and long-distance trains on the Drammen Line started stopping at Lysaker. Oslo Sporveier and the Norwegian National Rail Administration launched a proposal for a tram-train service in 1997, largely inspired by the Karlsruhe model.Oslo Sporveier et. al. (1997): 6 The last plane departed from Fornebu on 7 October 1998.Bredal (1998): 23‚Äì29 Work on planning the use of Fornebu after the airport was closed started in the early 1990s.Deloitte (2012): 8 The degree of how dense the peninsula was to be built was a source of controversy. Initial plans called for the establishment of a suburban area with lots and single dwellings. Ownership of the airport land was held by the government through Statsbygg and Oslo Municipality.Deloitte (2012): 11 Both a 1992 and a 1997 report concluded that it would benefit society the most if Fornebu was redeveloped as a residential area, with as many as 14,000 residences being quoted as a suitable number. However, this was later shifted towards more commercial and less residential space. In December 1999 the land-owners committed to contributing 200 million kroner towards a rail link, which was increased to 500 million in January 2000. B√¶rum Municipal Council approved the zoning plan for Fornebu in April 2000, which called for 5,000 residences and 15,000 jobs. This issue was appealed by Statsbygg, who demanded an increase in utilization. The Ministry of the Environment concluded in September that the number of residences be increased to 6,000. The latter sold its properties to Fornebu Boligspar in 2001, the same year as Statsbygg sold its properties to a series of investors. Statoil is one of several large companies to have built major office complexes at Fornebu The first report regarding a rail transit system to the redeveloped Fornebu was published in April 2001, published by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration. It investigated both bus, people mover, mainline railway and a tramway.Norwegian Public Roads Administration et. al (2001): 10 The mainline railway alternative was based on the Asker Line being routed via Fornebu instead of running directly to Lysaker from Sandvika Station.Norwegian Public Roads Administration et. al (2001): 71 By 2001 construction of the Asker Line was under way and soon this alternative was ruled out. The Ministry of Transport and Communications determined in August that building a line would be the responsibility of Akershus County Municipality, B√¶rum Municipality and, if applicable, Oslo Municipality. The following month a state grant of 600 million kroner was issued.Deloitte (2012): 9 As an intermediate solution a bus service was established from Oslo to Fornebu. The number of buses have increased dramatically as new work places have opened, although there is no spare capacity on the buses. A further 2,500 in Fornebu opened in 2013 when Statoil opened its capital offices. The lack of transit was also a hindrance for the construction of housing, as this required the transit system to be in place. As of 2012 only 300 residences had been built at Fornebu. 2004 map proposal of the Fornebu Line as a people mover and an extension of the metro from the Kols√•s Line to Lysaker Akershus County Municipality issued a report investigating tramway, people mover and bus rapid transit in March 2002. The county council voted in June to pursue a people mover, although it kept the possibility open for a connection onwards via tramway or metro. Further reports were issued in December 2002 and February 2003, and in April 2003 the county again approved a people mover, and asked Oslo Municipality to build a metro line to Lysaker. However, in the following three years there was a shift in the interest of building a people mover. A new report was issued in 2006 and in May 2007 Akershus County Council voted in favor of building a tramway. A contributing factor was that a large array of expert bodies, including Oslo Sporveier, the Public Roads Administration, the Institute of Transport Economics and a series of consulting companies all recommended that a people mover was not suitable. The main downsides of a people mover gradually became evident for the county politicians. These included the inability to provide a direct service to Oslo and the system costs of have a fourth rail system, in addition to a metro, tramway and mainline railway. A particular concern was that very few people chose to use public transport if there are two or more transfers, which would be reality for many with a people mover. Ruter attempted to base its right-of-way planning for the tramway along the regulated right-of-way of the people mover. However, this was not compatible as the premise for the people mover was that it would run elevated for its route, thus avoiding conflicts with road traffic. This issue made the tramway route unfeasible in the old route and Ruter therefore had to design a new route.Ruter (2010): 10 Ruter was established as a common transit agency for Oslo and Akershus in May 2008, and took over the responsibility for planning. Ruter has since published a series of reports looking at the various modes and routes.Deloitte (2012): 10 It thereby concluded that a tramway would not be suitable and eventually landed on that a metro line exclusively in a tunnel via Sk√∏yen to Majorstuen would be preferable. It cited the need for quick travel speeds to the city center, connection with the other transit systems and sufficient capacity to handle increased development at Fornebu. The metro alternative was approved of by Akershus County Council in December 2012 and Oslo Municipal Council in April 2013. Premise Telenor Arena and the old control tower is a recurring proposed site for a station A planned 20,000 jobs and 6,000 residences are to be located at Fornebu. The transit system therefore has to be dimensioned to handle this number of commuters during the morning rush-hour. Further expansion to the plans could bring the total number of jobs to 25,000. The increase would have to be entirely based on transit, as there is no sufficient parking capacity for more people to drive. Demand for the various modes is more or less the same, at about 4,000 people per hour in both directions. However, given a long-term, high-growth development, only the metro alternative actually has sufficient capacity to handle the traffic estimates.Ruter (2011): 11 The zoning plan of Fornebu is designed in such a way that only a limited amount of the area can be built before a rail transit is under construction. Financing of the line will come from a variety of sources. There is funding in Oslo Package 3, an amalgamation of various national and local grants and toll fees, but this is insufficient to finance construction, even if it is delayed until 2027. Land-owners at Fornebu have committed 500 million 2000-kroner towards the construction of a rail transit. Ruter is considering if it should build the line as a public‚Äìprivate partnership.Ruter (2011): 9 An alternative way to generate additional funding is that the land-owners pay for part of the infrastructure in exchange for a change to the zoning allowing more dense construction. Since 2013 the Ministry of Transport and Communications has promised to fund half the investments, although it is uncertain if this funding could be released before 2018. Proposed modes and routes =Suburban line= The 1919 proposal for a light rail was based on the standard of the western suburban lines, which are today part of the metro. The Lilleaker Line was proposed linked to the Common Tunnel at Majorstuen Station and a branch from the Lilleaker Line was proposed built, with two alternative routings, either branching near Lilleaker Station or at Bestum Station, intersecting via a culvert with the Drammen Line near Lysaker and then continuing through Fornebu in the middle of the peninsula. It would cross Snar√∏ysundet to Snar√∏en and over Lille Ostsund to Ost√∏en. Further extensions to Br√∏n√∏en were also called for, but at a later date. The municipal committee saw the line not only as a possibility for serving local residents, but also to transport day tourists from the city to the seaside.Kristiania og Akers Sporveiskomite (1919): 27 =Commuter rail= The mainline railway alternative called for the use of NSB Class 69 trains, such as this one at Heggedal Station The 1981 proposal by the Institute of Transport Economics called for a mainline railway service to Fornebu as a single-track branch from the Drammen Line to the airport terminal. The intersection was proposed located east of Lysaker Station, hinder trains from stopping at Lysaker. This was caused both by the geological conditions and road plans. The line would branch off and run under the Drammen Line and E18 in a tunnel. It would ascend between Snar√∏yveien and the fjord and continue to a station situated at the water aerodrome. The station would feature two tracks and would include an elevated walkway over to the terminal. Depending on the options for expanding Fornebu, the then main terminal was proposed rebuilt to an international terminal and a new domestic terminal was proposed built. This would have required the railway line to be extended and a second station be built. The line was estimated to cost 100 million kroner.Berthelsen (1981): 27 The line would have been built and operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). As the Oslo Tunnel between Sk√∏yen and Oslo Central Station is the bottle-neck of the system, the proposal called for existing routes of the Oslo Commuter Rail from the east which run through the tunnel and terminate at Sk√∏yen council be extended to Fornebu. The proposal called for three every twenty minutes and a travel time of twelve minutes. The system would be able to take advantage of the airport being served against the rush-hour flows.Berthelsen (1981): 28 Even when the investments in rail infrastructure were included, operating costs for a rail transit system were lower than that of a bus service.Berthelsen (1981): 30 However, the lack of a train station in the terminal would add five minutes walking time. The proposal also examined various fast ferry services and found that the rail service would be between five and nine minutes faster than any coach or ferry option.Berthelsen (1981): 40 Map of NSB's two railway lines (alt. 1 is the branch and alt. 2 is the loop) and its people mover proposal (alt. 3) The 1986 proposal by NSB considered the use of more modern rolling stock than the Class 69 trains being used.Norwegian State Railways (1986): 4 In addition to a branch proposal, it called for a loops from the Drammen Line between the stations of Stabekk and H√∏vik which would run down to Fornebu and stop at a station before continuing onwards to Lysaker. By then it was determined that keeping Oslo Airport, Fornebu would involve building a new, domestic terminal, situated at Oksen√∏en, from the old terminal. The train station would be situated between these and a moving walkway built between the terminals and to the train station. NSB preferred the loop, as it allowed trains running along the Drammen Line to deviate via Fornebu and serve the airport. The branch line would require all traffic from the west to transfer at Lysaker. Costs were estimated at 160 million kroner, including a third track from Bestun Station to Stabekk.Norwegian State Railways (1986): 17 NSB presumed that a similar operating procedure be carried out for a branch service. However, it proposed a different route which branched off west of Lysaker Station. By linking these with various lines to the east, this would allow direct services to the airport from the √òstfold Line, the Gj√∏vik Line and the Trunk Line. For a loop service, NSB proposed that the airport be served with existing commuter trains running on the Drammen Line between Asker Station and Lillestr√∏m Station (today's line L1).Norwegian State Railways (1986): 18 The main advantage was that it would allow all regional and express trains, including those serving to the Bergen Line, the S√∏rlandet Line and the Vestfold Line, to call at the airport. Travel times were estimated at 12 minutes to Oslo Central Station, 18 minutes to Asker, and 25 and 33 minutes, respectively by commuter and express train, to Drammen Station.Norwegian State Railways (1986): 19 NSB estimated a twenty-five percent market share, giving an estimated 3,500 to 8,000 daily passengers, depending on how much airline traffic was allocated to Fornebu. A major advantage was that it would largely come as an additional product for existing services and would thus be economically favorable for NSB.Norwegian State Railways (1986): 20 The final railway proposal was placed in a 2001 report. It looked at the possibility that the Asker Line would have been placed in a different route between Sandvika and Sk√∏yen through Fornebu. Various routes were considered, some of which would stop and other which would not at Lysaker. Alternatively the branch proposal with two station was considered from Lysaker. THis would involve the construction of about of new railway.Norwegian Public Roads Administration et. al (2001): 71‚Äì72 =Automated people mover= Detailed map of the proposed route of the people mover The first proposal for a people mover was launched by NSB in 1986 and was centered around being a link for the airport. The line would have its start at Stabekk Station on the Drammen Line, where it would be located next to the railway platforms. NSB would schedule all services along the Drammen Line stop at Stabekk. The stations at the terminals would be built in the immediate vicinity of the check-ins. The line would have been long and have two stations, one at each of the terminals. In such capacity it would double as a transit system between the terminals, which would be situated on each side of the runway. Travel time to Oslo Central Station was estimated at 15 minutes. A major advantage compared to the loop line was that the people mover would be able to serve both terminals, not just the new terminal. The second alternative for a people mover arose with the closing of the airport. Various technologies were pursued, ranging from a light metro‚Äîessentially a low- capacity rapid transit‚Äîto monorails. No universal standards are available and the system would have to be custom-built by a manufacturer. The system would run elevated or in a tunnel from Lysaker to Oksen√∏ykryset and from there as an elevated line. Akershus County Municipality opted for a monorail system, emphasizing the light design. Speeds would have been limited to .Akershus County Municipality (2004): 9 Crossection of Lysaker Station showing how the people mover could be integrated into the station From Lysaker the line was proposed built as a double-track system to Fornebu Senter and onwards as a single-tracked system to Norske Skog. The system would require 32 hourly departures during rush-hour and 16 departures per hour the rest of the day. Eight of these would continue on the single-tracked section. Travel time from Lysaker to Norske Skog would have been 12.5 minutes, 10 minutes to Fornebu Senter and 5 minutes to Telenor. The line would serve ten stations.Akershus County Municipality (2004): 17 The system could either be built in isolation, and rely on transfer to train at Lysaker, or be built in connection with a metro. The latter would result in an underground section through Lysaker and a common transfer between the three modes at Lysaker. The metro line was proposed as a branch of the Kols√•s Line from √Ösjordet Station and with an intersection and transfer to the Lilleaker Line at Lilleaker. Almost the entire section of metro would be built in a tunnel. at Lysaker a metro alternative would give transfer at the same platform between the two modes, while a non-metro alternative would give a people mover station below the train station.Akershus County Municipality (2004): 12 By linking up to five cars into a train, each departure could have a capacity of 175 people. This would allow for 5,600 passengers per hour. Initial reports regarded this as sufficient,Akershus County Municipality (2004): 18 but later reports found this to be insufficient. The system would require eleven trains.Akershus County Municipality (2004): 24 Illustration of crossections of people movers in tunnel, at-grade and elevated During later planning phases the county also looked at the possibility for the line to be built in such a way that it at a later date could be converted to a tramway and connected to the Oslo Tramway. The alternative gave a large hike in the investment costs, while it provided no advantages during the initial operating phase. The structure's width and visual profile would increase and of these reasons the alternative was abandoned.Akershus County Municipality (2004): 6 A major advantage with the people mover was that it would allow for a good geographical coverage of the peninsula and could be built to make all bus services superfluous. The plans required that Lysaker Station had an exceptionally good transit service with links in many directions so that further transfers would not be necessary.Akershus County Municipality (2004): 27 Investments were estimated at 1.5 billion kroner in 2011, lower than any of the alternative modes. T2000 metro trains, which could both use overhead wires and third rails =Tram- train= The proposed tram-train route would run in a new tramway line from Fornebu to Lysaker. There it would connect to the Drammen Line from Lysaker Station to Sk√∏yen Station. At the latter site it would instead connect to the Sk√∏yen Line of the tramway via Bygd√∏y all√© and run to the city center and Jernbanetorget. The line was proposed extended eastwards partially along the Trunk Line and partially along a new light rail route via Akershus University Hospital to Lillestr√∏m and Kjeller in Skedsmo.Oslo Sporveier et. al. (1997): 23 The line from Lysaker to Fornebu was estimated to cost 223 million krone, and a total cost of 334 million to reach the city center.Oslo Sporveier et. al. (1997): 24 The service took its basis in the new T2000 trains which had been delivered for the Holmenkollen Line a few years earlier. These were built so that they could operate both along light rails with overhead wires at 600 volts and on the metro with a third rail 750 volt power supply. Connection to the mainline railway would require the system to also handle . However, the system would only have to relate to standard gauge.Oslo Sporveier et. al. (1997): 13 The system posed a series of challenges. One was the difference in platform height and loading gauge. While the metro features a platform height of , the railways used and the tramway . Similarly, the vehicles have varying widths. This would mean that a tram-train would have to opt out of using existing platforms at all but one mode.Oslo Sporveier et. al. (1997): 14‚Äì15 The systems use varying standard top speeds and a tram-train would therefore have to have more power than a metro train to keep higher speeds to not slow other traffic on the mainline railway.Oslo Sporveier et. al. (1997): 19 =Tramway= A SL95 unit of the Oslo Tramway on a new section of track of the Lilleaker Line at √òraker Ruter's proposal for a tramway was based on two separate routes from the city center to Lysaker and one proposed route from Lysaker through Fornebu. From the city center the trams would run along the Sk√∏yen Line, while others would run from Majorstuen to via the Frogner Line to Frogner plass and from there in a new line to Sk√∏yen.Ruter (2011): 17 From Sk√∏yen there were two proposed routes to Lysaker. The one involved using the existing Lilleaker Line to Furulund Station, where the line would branch off. It would then run in a tunnel to Lysaker and onwards to Oksen√∏yveien. The alternative, which was named the Fjord Tramway, was proposed to run from the Sk√∏yen, through a short tunnel under the E18 and along Bestumkilen. It would have an intermediate station at V√¶ker√∏ and then continue in a tunnel to Lysaker and onwards to Oksen√∏yveien. It would be located in an underground station at Lysaker, blow the lot north of the station. The station would be located at below mean sea level in bedrock. This allows it to be built without interrupting operations at Lysaker Station, without interfering with the structures on the lot above and giving sufficient depth to pass under Lysakerelva.Ruter (2010): 10‚Äì11 From Oksen√∏yveien, where it would feature a stop, the line would continue onwards to stations at Telenor Arena and the Telenor head office. It would run through a short tunnel to Rolfsbukta and then start turning around to in a circle to Koksa and terminate at Fornebu Senter. A future extension was proposed onwards to Stor√∏ykilen and Norske Skog's head office. The line from Fornebu Senter to Furulund would be , while an extension from Fornebu Senter to Norske Skog would be . Travel time from Fornebu Senter to Lysaker would be 8.5 minutes and from Fornebu Senter to Nationaltheatret 27.5 minutes. The line is proposed to be served by 24 trams per hour from Fornebu to Sk√∏yen, of which 8 continue to the city center and onwards along an extended Sinsen Line to Tonsenhagen.Ruter (2010): 8 In 2011 the costs of a tramway were estimated at 2.7 billion kroner.Ruter (2011): 6 The tramway alternative could have been built as a branch of the Lilleaker Line Ruter has also explored what it has termed as a \\"semimetro\\". This concept was based on the agency's long-term plan to upgrade the tram network to a system similar to a stadtbahn. It would run with conventional tram vehicles, connected in pairs and with a combined capacity of ca. 360 passengers. In relation to its route, it was planned built at ground level with six station at Fornebu (Fornebu Senter, Koksa, Rolfsbukta, Telenor, Telenor Arena and Oksen√∏ykryssset). From there it would run to Sk√∏yen in a tunnel with intermediate stations at Lysaker and V√¶ker√∏. From Sk√∏yen some services would run along existing tramways to the city center, while others would run in a tunnel to Majorstuen.Ruter (2011): 18 Ruter estimated the cost of the semimetro at 3.5 billion kroner in 2011. It would have 16 hourly departures to Sk√∏yen, half of which would continue to Majorstuen and half of which would continue to the city center. The tramway alternative has the easiest and fastest access, being located at street level. This encourages passengers which will take it between stops on Fornebu and travelers heading to Lysaker. However, the long travel time by tram to the city centers means that most travelers will switch to trains at Lysaker. Estimates show that in the long run the tramway alternative may not have sufficient capacity to handle all the traffic to Fornebu. The tramway is in the process of ordering new trams. One of the goals is that they can be a shelf ware. Should the Fornebu Line be built as a tramway, it would feature the only tunnels on the network. This would result in the trams having to be built in a higher fire grade, resulting in significantly higher costs for all trams for the network. Alternatively special trams for the Fornebu Line would have to be built, eliminating possibility of economy of scale.Ruter (2013): 48 =Metro= Majorstuen, the westernmost station of the Common Tunnel, is proposed as the Fornebu Line's terminus. The first metro proposal, from 2009, called for the line to be built as a branch of the Kols√•s Line from Ullern√•sen. Except for a short portion at the southern end, the entire line was proposed in a tunnel. After Ullern√•sen the line would have only three stations, Lysaker, Telenor Arena and Fornebu Senter. However, additional stations were considered. Eight hourly services were proposed, which could or could not continue from Majorstuen through the Common Tunnel.Ruter (2010): 14‚Äì15 Further plans called for an upgrade to allow a fly-over at Makrellbekken, on the R√∏a Line. A second main proposal was launched in 2011, whereby the metro would follow a new route. It would leave Majorstuen in its own right-of-way in a tunnel. It would turn ninety degrees and run under the Frogner Park to a station at Sk√∏yen. From there it would run close to Bestumkilden, with an intermediate station at V√¶ker√∏ before reaching Lysaker. The line would have three stations on Fornebu: Telenor Arena, Flyt√•rnet (Telenor) and Fornebu Senter. Ruter recommended this alternative, based on its combination of fast travel time to the city center and that a metro alternative is the only service which can be guaranteed to have sufficient capacity in the long run.Ruter (2011): 26 Ruter estimated the cost of a metro via Ullern√•sen at 3.0 billion kroner and via Sk√∏yen at 4.5 billion kroner in 2011. Ullern√•sen was previously proposed as the site for the Fornebu Line to branch off from the Kols√•s Line. The Sk√∏yen route has an estimated travel time of 5 minutes from Fornebu Senter to Lysaker and 12 minutes from Fornebu Senter to Majorstuen. This involves building a from Majorstuen to Sk√∏yen, to V√¶ker√∏, to Lysaker, to Arena, to Flyt√•rnet and to Fornebu Senter. Sixty percent of the line will run in Oslo.Deloitte (2012): 7 There has also been proposals to build a station at Madserud and the Frogner Park, although the need given the sparse population has been questioned. A major challenge with the metro alternative is the network's congestion through the Common Tunnel, which is shared by all lines between Majorstuen and T√∏yen. Currently the capacity through the tunnel is limited to 28 trains per hour per direction, although Ruter hopes than improvements in signaling can increase this to 32. This, combined with turning trains from the Holmenkollen Line at Majorstuen, will allow all eight hourly metro trains to reach the downtown area. There are plans to build a second metro tunnel through the city center, with estimates for completion around 2030.Ruter (2011): 23 =Bus rapid transit= Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated bus on Line 31 to Fornebu in Bygd√∏y all√© Buses make up the current public transport service to Fornebu, and as of 2011 Ruter operates up to 53 buses per hour to the peninsula. They partially run along reserved bus lanes. However, there is not sufficient capacity at street level to handle more buses at the stops. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration is considering alternatives for handling increases buses, including that of building a bus terminal. Construction of a rail transit system would make further upgrades superfluous.Ruter (2011): 13 Termed \\"superbus\\", Ruter has investigated the possibilities of building a bus rapid transit. From the city center the route would follow the current bus route along Bygd√∏y all√© for street access, while other buses would run on the motorway to Oslo Bus Terminal. It would follow the same right-of-way as a tramway would from Sk√∏yen to Fornebu and would run either in a tunnel or along the fjord from Lysaker to Sk√∏yen. It would serve Lysaker via an underground terminal and continue in a tunnel to √òksen√∏ykrysset. It would continue through Fornebu halting at six stops. However, Ruter was concerned that it would be difficult to create an efficient system without large-scale bus lane conversion in the city center.Ruter (2011): 20 Investments were estimated at 1.7 billion kroner in 2011.

This pattern officially replaced the U.S. Army's previous Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) as the official combat uniform pattern for most U.S. soldiers at the end of September 2019. The pattern also superseded the closely related MultiCam, a pattern previously used for troops deploying to Afghanistan. The United States Air Force is also replacing their Airman Battle Uniform with the ACU in OCP after positive feedback from airmen who wore the uniform while being deployed to Afghanistan with Army soldiers. The original \\"Scorpion\\" pattern was developed by a joint venture of the Army's Natick Labs and Crye Precision as part of the Objective Force Warrior (OFW) program more than a decade prior. Crye then modified it to create MultiCam for commercial sales. In July 2014, the Army announced that OCP could be used in the field by the summer of 2015. In early April 2015, Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno revealed that OCP uniforms were beginning to be issued to deployed soldiers going to Afghanistan, Iraq, Europe, and the Horn of Africa. The OCP ACU became available for soldiers to purchase starting 1 July 2015. Background =Selection process= In the early 2010s, the US Army concluded that UCP did not adequately meet all of the concealment needs for Afghanistan‚Äôs multiple regions. In 2010, the United States Army Camouflage Improvement Effort considered 22 entrants. The Army eliminated the patterns down to five finalists who exceeded the baseline patterns and Scorpion W2 was among them in the Army's in-house submission (the Army later withdrew their submission leaving the four commercial vendors). The finalists in the Army's Phase IV camouflage testing were: Crye Precision; ADS Inc. and Hyperstealth Inc.; Brookwood Companies Inc.; and Kryptek Inc. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDA or NDAA), prevents any service from adopting a new camouflage pattern not already in inventory before the NDA, unless they get all other services to adopt the same pattern. As a result, the Army had to consider existing camouflage patterns within the United States Department of Defense. Initially, the Army's first pattern choice was the MultiCam pattern developed by Crye Precision, but allegedly due to \\"printing fees\\", procurement discussions broke down. Crye Precision developed the original Scorpion pattern under a government contract in 2002. The pattern was modified by the United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center in 2009 and named the Scorpion W2 pattern. The Army owns the licensing rights for Scorpion W2, which lowers the overall cost, and allows the Army the option to restrict the pattern to service members only. =Rollout= US Army Soldiers wearing OCP uniforms mixed with legacy UCP equipment while shooting M16s at a shooting range. The Army Combat Uniform patterned in OCP first became available to U.S. Army soldiers on 1 July 2015 at 20 locations in the contiguous United States and in South Korea, with first-day sales exceeding $1.4 million. More installations began sales later in 2015, although soldiers deploying on real-world missions will receive uniforms and equipment printed in OCP. The T-shirt and belt in the new Coyote 498 color are available, though soldiers are allowed to continue to wear their current T-shirt, belt, and boots in Tan 499 until October 2019, when the new pattern becomes mandatory. Body armor, packs, and pouches in previous UCP and MultiCam patterns will be worn until they can be replaced with OCP. On 14 May 2018, the U.S. Air Force announced that all airmen will transition from the Airman Battle Uniform to the OCP uniform. All Airmen will be allowed to wear OCP uniforms beginning 1 October 2018. Recruits in basic training, and cadets in Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, and Officer Training School will start being issued OCPs on 1 October 2019. All Airmen will be required to own OCP uniforms by 1 April 2021. The U.S. Space Force has also adopted the OCP uniform, but with navy blue thread for ranks and tapes.

After the party's first conference which was held in the North-East, the party issued a statement declaring that the MCPM has decided to carry out the New Democratic Revolution and would conduct the protracted people's war in collaboration with the other \\"Maoist revolutionary parties.\\" Organisation The Coordinator of the Standing Committee of MCPM is Kyonghan, and its vice chairperson is Mang Ulen San. The Publicity and Propaganda secretary is Nonglen Meitei. The MCPM has alleged that Chingranglen Meitei, who was working as the General Secretary of the party was ferret out and arrested by a squad of the Indian armed forces, while he was approaching towards his comrades. On 20 May 2014, the MCPM released an official statement that the party was not being able to trace Chingranglen Meitei since the time of his alleged abduction [by Indian personnel], and has no clue about his \\"whereabouts.\\" A united revolution is still a failure in Manipur due to cerebrated design of those trying to create division amongst indigenous community inhabiting in the state from time immemorial.

The KCP (Maoist), in November 2010, pledged \\"support\\" to \\"Indian Maoists.\\" Election boycott The MCPM boycotted the 2012 Manipur Legislative Assembly election and banned \\"all election related functions\\" in the state because the party believed that the \\"assembly elections in Manipur would never bring welfare to the people nor bring any development\\" and would just amplify the \\"Indian system of rule.\\" In April 2014, the MCPM called for a \\"political strike\\" in Manipur and boycotted the Indian general election, 2014 in the state, saying that \\"the Indian election is not needed.\\" The ban imposed on the Indian general election, 2014 in Manipur by the MCPM along with the United Revolutionary Front, and the Kuki National Army (Indian) affected the political campaigning of the candidates, and they had to drop their door‚Äìto‚Äìdoor campaign while several candidates avoided to visit their constituencies as a violent armed action was expected beyond doubt if \\"electioneering\\" would have been attempted in Manipur. The MCPM had urged its comrades to closely and alertly monitor the electoral campaign of the political parties and their contestants, and to execute strategies to pester the election process while avoiding to engender inconvenience to the people.

Rivele, and Christopher Wilkinson, which interprets the life and compositions of jazz musician Miles Davis. The film stars Cheadle, Emayatzy Corinealdi, and Ewan McGregor, and closed the New York Film Festival on October 11, 2015. The film takes its title from Davis's 1957 album. Cheadle took a free-form approach to the film's narrative. Skipping around in time, it depicts Davis' attempts to get his career back on track following a period of inactivity and drug addiction in the 1970s, fictional adventures with a journalist (played by McGregor) who wants to profile him, and his troubled marriage to a former dancer (Corinealdi). The film's score covers, in non- linear fashion, Davis' actual recordings throughout his career, beginning with Agharta (1975) before jumping back and forth in scenes featuring Kind of Blue (1959), Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), Bitches Brew (1970), and We Want Miles (1981), among others. Miles Ahead received mostly positive reviews from critics. Reviewers generally praised Cheadle's direction and performance, although some were critical of the plot. The film has grossed over $5 million.  Plot synopsis  Adapted from Sony Classics In the midst of a prolific career, Miles Davis (Don Cheadle) disappears from public view for a period of five years in the late 1970s. He lives in isolation while dealing with chronic pain from a deteriorating hip, a musical voice inhibited and numbed by drugs and painkillers, and traumatic memories of his past. A music reporter, Dave Braden (Ewan McGregor), forces his way into Davis' house and, over the next couple of days, the two men unwittingly embark on an adventure to recover a stolen tape recording of the musician's most recent compositions. Davis' mercurial behavior is fueled by memories of his failed nine-year marriage (1959-1968)http://santafe.com/blogs/read/the-matra-diva-the-iconic-frances- davis to the talented and beautiful dancer Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi). During their romance and subsequent marriage, Frances served as Davis' muse. It was during this period that he released several of his signature recordings, including Sketches of Spain (1960) and Someday My Prince Will Come (1961). The marriage was marked by infidelity and abuse, however, and Frances was forced to flee for her own safety as Miles' mental and physical health deteriorated. By the late 1970s, plagued by years of regret and loss, Davis flirts with self-destruction until he finds redemption in his music.

Production  Cheadle originally was drawn to the project to explore the creative process in the approach to composition used by Miles Davis over the many years of his career. According to Cheadle at the Sundance Film Festival debut of the film, the approach to the film was not to produce a biopic but to create plausible though largely fictional vignettes of Davis' life that interpreted the creative process Davis used in the composition of his music.Pape, Stefan, \\"Don Cheadle Exclusive Interview - Miles Ahead\\". HeyUGuys, April 17, 2016. YouTube. The idea for Cheadle to star in a film about Miles Davis began when he was auditioning for Ali, and it was suggested by writer Chris Wilkenson, noting that he knew the Davis family. Cheadle was interested although he didn't seriously consider it until 2006. That year, when Miles Davis was being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Davis' nephew stated that Cheadle was the only person who could play Miles and that a film was coming with him starring. At the time there were no actual plans for the movie and the comments came to Cheadle as a surprise. Intrigued by the comments, however, Cheadle met with the Davis family, who pitched him a variety of concepts, none of which interested him. Cheadle finally brought up the concept of portraying Davis as a \\"gangster\\", based on his life in 1945 and the 1970s. The family approved this concept, and Cheadle soon realized that he was the only one with the vision to write and direct the film this way. The working title for the film was originally Kill the Trumpet Player.Fischer, Russ (November 13, 2013), \\"Don Cheadle Finally Set to Star in and Direct Miles Davis Biopic ‚ÄòKill The Trumpet Player‚Äô\\", slashfilm. Retrieved June 10, 2016. The score for Miles Ahead used music from Davis's recording career, opening the film with \\"Prelude (Part 2)\\" from Davis' 1975 album Agharta. This transitioned into other periods of his music career, including recordings from Porgy and Bess and Kind of Blue in 1959, Nefertiti and Filles de Kilimanjaro in 1968, Bitches Brew and the Jack Johnson sessions from 1969 to 70, the 1974 Dark Magus performance, and We Want Miles (1981). Cheadle explained to Billboard magazine about using this non-linear narrative with Davis' music: \\"I didn't want to be stuck with one period of his music. I think had we told it in a way that was chronological, was cradle to grave, was standard telling, we would've been pigeonholed into these moments that coincided with the music, and they would've all been given short shrift.\\" Cheadle has said the casting of Ewan McGregor, who plays a journalist in the film, was partly because the actor had a high box-office appeal in territories outside North America: \\"I could have cast a huge French actor, or an Asian actor who's big in Japan, China, and try to make it work for that. Because it's all about selling foreign. No needle moved until we cast Ewan McGregor\\". The financing of the film required multiple sources including crowdfunding. Cheadle said: \\"We crowdfunded via Indiegogo, deferred payment, I put money in myself. Kevin Hart, Pras, my producer's cousin, my other producer's friend put money in. It was just like that kind of a situation\\". Filming began on July 7, 2014 in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the first film's first promotional photo was released. Filming wrapped on August 16, 2014. Release and reception In August 2015, Sony Pictures Classics acquired distribution rights to Miles Ahead. The film had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on October 10, 2015. It grossed $2.6 million in the United States and Canada and $2.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $5.1 million. Miles Ahead received generally positive reviews from critics. Metacritic, which assigns a rating in the 0‚Äì100 range based on reviews from top mainstream publications, calculated an average score of 64, based on 39 reviews. , the film holds a 73% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 177 reviews with an average rating of 6.41/10; the site's consensus reads, \\"Miles Ahead is worth watching for Don Cheadle's strong work on both sides of the camera, even if this unconventional biopic doesn't quite capture its subject's timeless appeal\\". In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that while Davis purists may complain about the imagined sequences in the film, \\"they'll...miss the pleasure and point of this playfully impressionistic movie.\\" She was particularly impressed by Cheadle's ability to shift between \\"times, moods and modes effortlessly\\". Chicago Sun-Times critic Richard Roeper gave Miles Ahead three out of four stars and found most of it silly but often engrossing, crediting Cheadle for attempting to make a unique music biopic while giving \\"a brilliant performance worthy of an Oscar nomination\\". In a less enthusiastic review, Kenneth Turan from the Los Angeles Times stated the only \\"fully realized\\" characters played by Cheadle and Corinealdi were surrounded by a plot he deemed clich√©d, unsophisticated, and forgettable. Rex Reed was more critical in a one-star review for The New York Observer, writing that it was overwhelmingly plagued by \\"hyperbole and innuendo\\" while taking issue with Cheadle's depiction of Davis and his life: \\"According to the jazz musicians I know, he was unpredictable and borderline crazy, but nothing like the moody, unhinged and dangerous stray bullet depicted here.\\" Soundtrack *See Miles Ahead (soundtrack) See also *List of black films of the 2010s References External links  * Miles Beyond the Biopic: Don Cheadle Riffs on a Jazz Legend Category:2015 films Category:2015 biographical drama films Category:2010s musical drama films Category:American films Category:American musical drama films Category:African-American musical films Category:African-American biographical dramas Category:Films shot in Ohio Category:Biographical films about musicians Category:Jazz films Category:English-language films Category:Miles Davis Category:Cultural depictions of jazz musicians Category:2015 directorial debut films Category:2015 drama films ","title":"Miles Ahead (film)"},{"id":"43001953","text":"Chukwuedu Nathaniel II Nwokolo (19 April 1921 ‚Äì 18 May 2014)Prof. Chukwuedu Nwokolo: 1921-2014 was a Nigerian physician specialist in tropical diseases. He was recognised for discovering and mapping out the area of paragonimiasis lung disease in Eastern Nigeria, with a study of the disease in Africa and clinical research for its control. He founded SICREP: Sickle Cell Research Programme to effectively fight the disease in Nigeria and globally. Early life =Parents and birth= Nwokolo was born on Tuesday 19 April 1921 ‚Äì at Amaimo, now located in Imo State: Nigeria, where his parents worked for Church Missionary Society as evangelist. He was the first male child amongst seven children His father: Nathaniel Ezuma Nwokolo, was a church teacher; and his mother was trained at the Niger CMS: Church Missionary Society Onitsha. Education Nwokolo started primary school at Ezinihitte-Mbaise in today's Imo State, and then Government College Umuahia. In 1939, he entered Higher College Yaba, studying medicine. Most of the students that went to Government College Umuahia went on to Yaba College which was the only science-based institution of higher learning at the time. Nwokolo's medical course lasted seven years including internship, with the General Hospital Lagos and Aba General Hospital as teaching hospitals. Nwokolo qualified as a medical doctor in 1946, and consequently got the LMS: Licenciate of the School of Medicine.and won the Walter Johnson prize in public health. Early career =Pioneer Medical Officer= After his internship at Lagos General Hospital, Nwokolo was posted from 1947 to 1949 at General Hospital Enugu. In 1948, as the University College Ibadan was opening its teaching hospital temporarily at the Ibadan Adeoyo Hospital, the University made a request to the government for junior doctors to work as house officers. Nwokolo was the first of such assistant medical officers to be seconded in 1949. Nwokolo worked in the department of medicine at the University College Hospital from 1949 to 1950, and subsequently proceeded to London, uplifted with a professional letter of recommendation from professor Alexander Brown. =England move and RCPL= Arriving in England in 1950, he studied at Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup, and worked in medicine and surgery house jobs in Dover, becoming qualified to register and practice in Great Britain. He then became a senior house physician in the geriatrics unit of Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup. There, Nwokolo worked towards getting his MRCP: Membership of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1952, Nwokolo moved to Edinburgh to prepare further for the MRCP. He attended lectures and tutorials of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and clinics of some consultants. Early in 1953, Nwokolo took the MRCP examination,.He was one of the very few Africans to obtain such a MRCP: Membership of the Royal College of Physicians qualification, and the second Nigerian to do so: the first being Dr. Olu Mabayoje. Armed with the MRCP, Nwokolo went back to his former Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup, London. There, he served as a physician returned to Nigeria ‚Äì as a specialist in internal medicine ‚Äì just on time for his marriage to Njideka Priscilla Nwokolo: n√©e: Okonkwo ‚Äì on Saturday 4 July 1953. =Civil service= When he came back from London, Nwokolo returned to the civil service. He was appointed a special grade medical officer. Reorganisation in the service enabled all assistant medical officers to become medical officers after serving a period of one year as house officers. Nwokolo did one year house job in Ibadan before going to the United Kingdom for specialist medical qualification. He also did another year of house jobs in Dover after his highly successful conjoint LRCP and MRCP examination. With his senior house officer appointment and post MRCP working experience in the United Kingdom, Nwokolo earned his designation as a full medical officer on special grade. General Hospital Enugu was where he mainly served. Nwokolo had his extramural private practice in his home in the evenings. He was in charge of medical wards where in-patients were admitted and treated. =Research= Nwokolo carried out medical research in the wards as well as in the field. He did major research in endomyocardial fibrosis, endemic goitre, sickle-cell disease and other areas of national need. Fieldwork was usually done during weekends, and included travelling in his car to different locations in Eastern Nigeria plus Northern and Mid-Western Nigeria, as well as to Obudu. Nwokolo published about nine papers based on his research while in the civil service. On the strength of his research and papers, he was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (F.R.C.P.) in 1960, based on recommendations by his supervisors, Professor Alexander Brown and Professor Harold Scaborough, a visiting scholar from University of Wales. Nwokolo was also invited to teach as senior lecturer at University College Ibadan by professor Brown. In addition, working with the Rockefeller Foundation, Professor Brown recommended Nwokolo for a research fellowship in gastroenterology at the University of Minnesota. =Rockefeller Foundation fellowship= For his 1963 to 1964 Rockefeller Foundation fellowship at Minnesota, Nwokolo was assigned to the gastroenterology unit under James Carey,https://web.archive.org/web/20140714123051/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/56979/1/CommitteeAssignments1962-1963.pdf chief of gastroenterology.

Ojukwu also approved swift establishment of the faculty of medicine, headed by professor Kodilinye, while Nwokolo became the first head of the department of medicine and associate dean of medicine at the new medical school. Nwokolo continued to work as head of the department of medicine of the university teaching hospital which had moved to Awka-Etiti when Enugu was threatened during the civil war. Nwokolo also carried out research especially relevant to the terrible war conditions of starvation and malnutrition. He toured churches and public gatherings to educate the people on nutrition and feeding for survival. Several mimeographed papers were produced and distributed for public education. When the Nigerian Civil War ended in 1970, Nwokolo and family returned to Enugu, and found their house looted and the top floor completely razed by fire. He had to do some extensive rebuilding. With the approval of the Nigerian Federal Government for the re-opening of the University of Nigeria Nsukka, Nwokolo returned to his position as head of the department of medicine. He was appointed full professor in 1971. Accordingly, renowned Welsh academic, professor Eldryd Parry, who previously served at University College Hospital, Ibadan from 1960, affirms that Nwokolo led and facilitated the establishment of medical schools in Enugu and Nsukka.

Early life  Julia was the third born in a family of five girls and two boys. She did her primary education at three mission schools, later proceeding to Tegwani for her secondary education, and then enrolling for teacher training at Gutu Mission. She qualified as a teacher in 1958, and then proceeded to Usher Mission in 1961, where she pursued a diploma in Domestic Science. While at Usher, she met her future husband Cde Eddison Jonas Mudadirwa Zvobgo, who was soon to leave for the US to study at Tufts University in Massachusetts on a scholarship. Soon after they got married, she became pregnant with her first child Kerina, and as a result stayed at home with her family in Shurugwi.  Political career  Julia Zvobgo's earliest experience with racist repression was when she witnessed the arrest of her husband, then returning from the United States. Her husband was subsequently sentenced to 18 months‚Äô imprisonment. Having become a member of Zanu at its formation in August 1963, Zvobgo and other young women bore the brunt of suppressive racist colonial rule which peaked under the Rhodesian Front. The banning of Zanu in 1964 saw her husband detained and restricted for six years at Sikombela and other camps of incarceration across the country. As a result, she went to the UK. From 1968 -1971 she studied in the United Kingdom and at Hillcroft in Surrey. Later, on a United Nations scholarship, she completed a diploma in Institutional Management at Leeds Polytechnic. She then continued her higher education in 1975 in the United States where her husband was studying and teaching. In 1977, she obtained a BA in Political Science from Lewis University in Illinois, USA. When her husband left for Mozambique to join others in the liberation struggle, Zvobgo moved to study at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. In August 1978 she obtained a Master of Science degree in Administration. Zvobgo's commitment to her family and nationalist values made her endure the constant harassment and torture at the hands of the Rhodesian security agents who accused her of smuggling political messages to and from her detained husband and his colleagues. From 1968-1978 Julia studied abroad and later joined her husband in the armed struggle in Mozambique where she was elected Administrative Secretary for Women's Affairs. She attended problems of women in military and refugee camps and was one of the pioneers of the Women's League. Zvobgo was among the first group of Zanu-PF cadres to return to Zimbabwe in December 1979 after the Lancaster House Conference. She was part of election directorate and helped open the party's head office at 88 Manica Road (now Robert Mugabe Road). She was imprisoned for two weeks during the 1980 election campaign for allegedly assisting Zanla forces in the Zvishavane area and was only released after the polls. Julia was elected MP for the Midlands constituency of Zvishavane at the historic 1980 elections and was subsequently elected secretary for publicity and information in the Women's League in 1984. Cde Zvobgo was also a member of the Zanu-PF Central Committee during the first decade of Zimbabwe's independence. She was elected Secretary for Publicity and Information in the Women's League in 1984 and re-elected MP for Zvishavane in 1985. She retired from active politics in 1990 to concentrate on family business.  Death and remembrance  Julia Zvobgo died on Monday, 15 February 2004, after a heart attack at her Kambanji home in Harare. This followed a stroke that she suffered in 2003 while taking care of her ailing husband in Cape Town, South Africa. Mrs Zvobgo was given the rare honor of becoming the third woman - after Sally Mugabe and Joanna Nkomo (wife of Joshua Nkomo) - to be declared a National Hero. She was buried at the National Heroes Acre, a shrine that honors to Zimbabwe's independence fighters. It was announced on ZBC that President Mugabe would not attend her funeral as he was suffering from chest pains shortly after he celebrated his 80th birthday. However it is believed that President Mugabe did not attend the funeral as he was no longer on good terms with Zvobgo's husband, who was Mugabe's nemesis. Eddison Zvobgo, her husband, died six months after her death. Julia Zvobgo was a member of the Methodist Church. She is survived by three children; Kerina, Eddison Junior, Tsungirirai, and eight grandchildren.

The nineteenth century saw the reintroduction of accompanied music into the Church of Scotland. Organs began to be added to churches in large numbers and by the end of the century, roughly a third of Church of Scotland, over 80 per cent of kirks, had both organs and choirs. Similarly, in the Episcopalian Church the influence of the Oxford Movement and links with the Anglican Church led to the introduction of more traditional services, and by 1900 surpliced choirs and musical services were the norm. The Free Church that broke away from the kirk in 1843 in the Great Disruption, was more conservative over music, and organs were not permitted until 1883. Hymns were first introduced in the United Presbyterian Church in the 1850s. The visit of American Evangelists Ira D. Sankey, and Dwight L. Moody to Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1874‚Äì75 helped popularise accompanied church music in Scotland. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century there was and an attempt to produce a corpus of Scottish national song, involving Robert Burns and George Thomson, which helped make Scottish songs part of the European cannon of classical music. The bothy ballads, which dealt with the lives of agricultural workers, were mainly written in the period 1820‚Äì60 and then adapted and altered along with working life in the later part of the century. Evidence of continued activity in traditional music includes the manuscripts of James Simpson (f. 1820‚Äì30). The tradition continued with figures including James Scott Skinner. From the late nineteenth century there was renewed interest in traditional music, which was more academic and political in intent. In the late nineteenth century the revival would begin to have a major impact on classical music, with the development of what was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland. The tradition of European concert music in Scotland, which had been established in the eighteenth century faltered towards the end of the century. From the mid- nineteenth century classical music began a revival in Scotland, aided by the visits of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Felix Mendelssohn. Major composers included of the national school that developed in the late nineteenth century included Alexander Mackenzie, William Wallace), Learmont Drysdale and Hamish MacCunn. In the late part of the century, performers emerged who gained international reputations. They included Frederic Lamond, Mary Garden and Joseph Hislop. Church music Ira D. Sankey, whose singing and compositions helped popularise accompanied church music in Scotland in the late nineteenth century The nineteenth century saw the reintroduction of accompanied music into the Church of Scotland. This was strongly influenced by the English Oxford Movement, which encouraged a return to Medieval forms of architecture and worship. The first organ to be installed by a Church of Scotland church after the Reformation was at St. Andrews, Glasgow in 1804, but it was not in the church building and was used only for weekly rehearsals. Two years later the city council was petitioned to allow it to be moved into the church, but they deferred to the local presbytery, who decided, after much deliberation, that they were illegal and prohibited their use within their jurisdiction. In 1828 the first organ was controversially installed in an Edinburgh church. Around the same time James Steven published his Harmonia Sacra: A Selection of the Most Approved Psalm and Hymn Tunes, provocatively printed a frontispiece showing a small organ.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 149.

A. Low, ed., The Songs of Robert Burns (London: Routledge, 1993), , p. 1054. Burns collaborated with George Thomson (1757‚Äì1851) in A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs, published from 1793 to 1818, which adapted Scottish folk songs with \\"classical\\" arrangements. Thompson was inspired by hearing Scottish songs sung by visiting Italian castrati at the St Cecilia Concerts in Edinburgh. He collected Scottish songs and commissioned musical arrangements from the best European composers, who included Joseph Haydn (1732‚Äì1809) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1732‚Äì1809). Burns was employed in editing the lyrics. A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs was published in five volumes between 1799 and 1818. It helped make Scottish songs part of the European cannon of classical music,D. A.

Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 195‚Äì6. Also involved in the collection and publication of Scottish songs was Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832), whose first literary effort was Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, published in three volumes (1802‚Äì03). This collection first drew the attention of an international audience to his work, and some of his lyrics were set to music by Franz Peter Schubert (1797‚Äì1828), who also created a setting of Ossian.A.

Around 35 people were killed in the attack, with the exact count varying. It is thought the attack was revenge for the death of a cattle herder who died in a failed robbery. The attack may have also been ethnically motivated. Background The South Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo hosts people who fled Burundi during the civil war and multiple rebel groups including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and the National Liberation Forces (FNL). There are often conflicts in the area between ethnic Barundi, who emigrated from Burundi a couple of generations ago, and ethnic Bafuliru. In August 2013, eight residents of Mutarule were killed in an attack by unidentified armed men. An armed militia is stationed about from the village, but the perpetrators of the attack were never determined. Attack During the evening of June 6‚Äì7, 2014, the village of Mutarule in South Kivu was attacked. According to eyewitnesses, gunmen surrounded a local Protestant church and began firing indiscriminately. Other victims, all of whom were ethnic Bafuliru, were stabbed or burned in their homes. Several pregnant women were among the dead, which numbered 27 according to South Kivu governor Marcellin Cishambo. However, a government spokesperson said 34 people had died in the attack. A Reuters cameraman counted 37 bodies. An eyewitness reported 33 deaths: 9 men, 14 women, and 10 children. A different eyewitness report said 18 women and 8 children were among 33 dead. An additional 20 to 30 people were injured, 10 seriously. Cause and aftermath Government officials said the attack was part of a dispute over cattle. Earlier a cattle herder had been killed while attempting to take cattle from another farmer. The community of the deceased then organized a revenge attack, according to a government spokesperson. A United Nations (UN) statement said \\"fierce fighting\\" between the Bafuliru and Barundi had taken place the night before the attack. Some locals blamed the FNL for the attack, or said a local politician was to blame for \\"stoking ethnic tension.\\" The government quickly denied foreigners, such as the FNL, were involved. \\"Congolese [have] carried out these attacks,\\" remarked Cishambo. \\"The problem is that everyone in this area carries a weapon.\\" After the attack, some Mutarule natives packed up their belongings and moved away. A village elder commented \\"The first massacre took place, then the second one has just happened - and we did not even get to know what happened with the first massacre. We wonder why the killings should go on while the government is watching.\\" The UN said it would send MONUSCO peacekeeping troops to the area to protect the population. \\"These violent acts are unacceptable and need to stop immediately,\\" said mission head Martin Kobler. The local army commander was fired for a slow response to the attack. A man suspected of organizing the attack was arrested.

Background  Instances of NPE patent litigation have grown recently: NPEs (commonly referred to as patent trolls) accounted for the majority of patent infringement litigation in the U.S. in 2012, compared to less than a quarter in 2007. This is because NPEs can achieve a quick return on investment since most companies settle rather than fight, even if they believe the assertion to be invalid. Unified permits small and large companies alike to become members. Smaller members act as an early warning system by notifying Unified of NPE demand letters in exchange for notifying Unified if they ever plan to sell a Patent to an NPE. Unified defines discrete technology zones for members to join, including cloud storage, content delivery, or electronic payments to ensure Unified‚Äôs deterrence is focused. Unified also directly challenges the validity of NPE patents. By filing several inter partes reviews (IPRs) against patents owned by NPEs, Unified seeks to increase the costs that NPEs face when asserting invalid patents and to deter future NPEs from doing the same thing again. Unified also publishes monthly newsletters summarizing NPE activity against small businesses and technology companies.  History  Unified Patents was founded in 2012 by Kevin Jakel and Brian Hinman. Mr. Jakel is the former head of intellectual property litigation at Intuit. Mr. Hinman formerly worked as a vice president of InterDigital. In January 2013, Unified signed its first member. Since 2012, Unified has grown to more than 60 members including NetApp and Google. Unified Patents filed its first IPR against Clouding IP's patent 6,738,799. Since then Unified has filed several IPRs against patent trolls (e.g. against PersonalWeb regarding patent 5,978,791). In June and July 2016 Unified filed IPRs on patents belonging to the three most litigious NPEs of 2016: Uniloc, Sportbrain Holdings, and Shipping & Transit LLC, who together sued more than 200 companies in 2016.  Business  Unified Patents seeks to deter patent trolls from asserting poor quality patents in certain technology zones through a number of strategies. Unified collects annual fees from its members to fund its activities. Small companies are not charged by Unified. Unified assesses the risk posed by NPEs by monitoring NPE assertions. This information is used to challenge NPE owned patents. Some of Unified IPRs have already ended in settlement. Unified Patents does not pay for purchasing or licensing patents from patent trolls or NPEs.

The role was to provide liaison between his community and the government, to provide statistical information to The Dutch East Indies government on issues related to Arabs, to disseminate government regulations and decrees, and to ensure the maintenance of law and order. History In Batavia, The Arabs, according to Van den Berg, settled in an area called Pekojan. Pekojan is from Indonesian word Pe-Koja-an, which means The Koja, a term for Muslim people of Gujarat, India. While Koja itself is from word Khoja. Until the end of the 18th century, the area was mostly dominated by Khoja Gujarati settlers until 19th century. When Van den Berg did the study (1884-1886), there were no more Gujarati. At that time the majority of the settlers were Arabs and a handful of Chinese. Since about the 1970s, the Arabs are the minority and the Chinese turned into majority. He described Pekojan as a slum and dirty area. Approximately one and half century ago, the Arabs also had moved and lived in the suburbs (now Central Jakarta), such as Krukut and Tanah Abang areas. The Dutch East Indies colonial had a constitutional law recognized three categories of individuals in Batavia (and then later applied to other places): Europeans (dutch: Europeanen), Foreign Oriental (Vreemde Oosterlingen), and natives (Inlanders). As more and more immigrants immigrated from Hadramaut, The Dutch government started a law called wijkenstelsel in 1844 to segregate them from the rest of indigenous people. As result, the government required a head of the group, called Kapitan Arab, to be pointed from among the Arab community as a point of contact and liaison. The similar position was appointed for Kapitan Cina to Chinese. More than half of the Kapitan Arab appointed by the colonial government were non Sayyid people. This decision was made to undermine traditional Hadhrami assumption about their social status. The head sometimes is accompanied with an assistant called Luitenant van de Kapitein der Arabieren or simply Liutenant der Arabieren. The first Kapitein der Arabieren pointed by the Dutch East Indies government in Batavia was Said Naum during period of 1844-1864. He was succeeded by Muhammad bin Abubakar 'Aydid for period of 1864-1877. Among other Arabs who had the position in Batavia was Hasan Argoubi, Muhammad Umar Ba-Behir () and Umar bin Yusuf Mangus () during the period of 1902-1931. Umar Mangus was a rich merchant and had property business. For his service as the Kapitan Arab, Umar was awarded the title De Ridder in de Orde van Oranje- Nassau (Knight of The Order of Orange-Nassau). He was appointed on December 28, 1902 with Sheikh Ali bin Abdoellah bin Asir as his Liutenant der Arabieren. Before Umar Mangus was appointed as a Kapitan Arab, most Arabs had decided to choose Sharif Abdullah ibn Husein Alaydrus, a rich merchant, famous for his generosity and had good behavior as well as prominent among the Arabs and the Europeans. Many people think that with his close relationship with Europeans, he would be willing to accept the Arab captaincy. The colonial government constantly urged him to accept the position, but he firmly rejected it. He wasn't alone in refusing, as this refusal had the support of respected Arab elders. According to Snouck Hurgronje who observed in 1901, the Dutch colonial government had more difficulty appoint Kapitein der Arabieren as more and more indies-born Arabs (Muwallad) born who lacked authority compared to the pure-blood Hadramis (Wulayti) whose number diminished. In Cirebon, there was an Arab Indonesian appointed as a captain in 1845. As in Batavia, the Arab village here was once the abode of the Gujarati or likely of the Bengali too. In 1872 the colony in Indramayu separated from Cirebon to appoint a captain (or head) of Arabs. In Banjarmasin in around 1899, the Kapitan Arab was Said Hasan bin Idroes al-Habshi or more known as Habib Ujung Murung. The successor of Said Hasan as the Kapitein in South Kalimantan was Alwi bin Abdullah al- Habshi, who later moved to Barabai. Similarly, in Tegal, Pekalongan, Semarang, Surabaya, Gresik, Pasuruan, Bangil, Lumajang, Besuki, Banyuwangi, Surakarta, Sumenep, and various places in the archipelago had their own Kapitan Arab. One of the reasons the colonial government did this was to segregate Arabs from the indigenous people. In Pekalongan, one of the Captains was Hasan Saleh Argubi. In Bangil, the Kapitan Arab were Saleh bin Muhammad bin Said Sabaja (1892), Muhammad bin Saleh Sabaja (1920), and Muhammad bin Salim Nabhan (1930). In Banyuwangi, some Kapitan Arab who were in positions, among others, was Datuk Sulaiman Bauzir, Datuk Dahnan, Habib Assegaf, and Ahmad Haddad. In Pasuruan, the Kapitein der Arabieren was a Sayyid named Alim al-Qadri, which is the grandfather of Hamid Algadri. In Gresik, the Kapitan Arab in 1930's was Husein bin Muhammad Shahab while Kapitan Arab of Surabaya was Salim bin Awab bin Sungkar, who had large land () in the City Center of Surabaya, West Ketabang. According to two Bah√° º√≠ travelers from Iran and India who visited Makasar in 1885, the Iranian Bah√° º√≠ Sulayman Khan Tunukabanƒ±, known as Jamal Effendi, and his Indian-Iraqi friend Sayyid Mustafa Rumƒ±, the Kapitein der Arabieren in Makasar at the time was Said Ali Matard. In Palembang, most of the Kapitein der Arabieren, if not all, lived in 13-Ulu subdistrict (\\"Seberang Ulu or \\"upstream bank\\" of the Musi river). There is no known records of who was the first Captain, but the last one was Ahmad Al Munawar (d. 1970), better known as Ayip Kecik (Little Sayyid) or Yipcik.

Over fifty were built for clubs and private owners. Design and development Max Gerner's G II R sport, touring and training biplane was a development of his one-off G I. The two types had low cost, easily repaired structures built from proprietary steel tubing and unswept, constant chord wings with two truss braced spars; both had lattice girder fuselages and were largely fabric covered. Both also had open, tandem cockpits, fixed undercarriages and a single engine. However, the G II R was larger, heavier and had a choice of engines which typically doubled the power. The fuselage was lengthened, mostly by increased cockpit separation, strengthened with diagonal cross members between the longerons, which placed the rear cockpit behind, rather than over, the trailing edge. These changes raised the weight by 25% and so wing area was increased by extending the span by 20%. The G II R retained the N-form interplane and cabane struts of the G I, though the former no longer leaned outwards and the upper wing was somewhat higher over the fuselage. It had two extra inter-spar trusses (six rather than four) in its lower wing, which alone carried ailerons. A newly patented method cramped, rather than welded, trusses and spars together. The G II R was easier to transport as it wings could be folded parallel to its fuselage despite the move of the fuel reservoir from behind the engine firewall to the top of the upper wings, for it now consisted of two side-by-side tanks, one on each wing. G II Rs were powered by several different engines, some radial engines and some inverted inlines, but the prototype first flew with a Salmson 9 AD, a small, nine cylinder radial. Later this first example flew with a five cylinder BMW X. The Salmson was installed with its cylinder heads completely exposed but the wider spaced heads of the BMW protruded from a rounded cowling. The G-II RB and RC production aircraft had four cylinder Hirth HM 60 inverted inlines, producing , or the Hirth 60 R racing version. Behind the nose the G I and G II R fuselages were similar, with flat sides and rounded tops, apart from the increased inter-cockpit spacing. The G I and G II RB empennages also shared the same constant chord surfaces with semicircular tips. Early G II Rs had the same single axle main undercarriage and tailskid as on the G I but this was altered on from the G II RB onwards to one where each main wheel was mounted on a V-form strut mounted on the central lower fuselage, with a bungee shock absorber from the stub axle to the upper longeron. The tailskid was replaced with a small wheel on a sprung strut. Early in 1934 responsibility for the Gerner II R was taken over by Adler Werke, who produced cars and motorcycles; they retained Max Gerner as designer. Investigations into two serious accidents in 1933 and 1934 concluded that the G II R's deep, over-wing fuel tank could blank airflow over the tail and cause loss of control. The result was the G II RC, which had a shallower tank and revised tapered and broadened tail surfaces. Its elevators were fitted with trim tabs. The new tank moved the centre of gravity significantly rearwards and to compensate the wings were swept back at about 8¬∞ and broadened ailerons fitted. Operational history The second G II R, the first production example, appeared at the D√ºsseldorf contest in 1931. Though it did not compete, it flew part of the course. The design gained aristocratic support from Hermann-Otto Graf zu Solms aus Lich. Over the next few years he bought four G II R variants and flew them competitively. Four G II Rs were entered in the 1933 Deutschland Flug () though only two, including his, competed. In 1934 two more G II Rs took part and Solms, with his navigator W.H. Storp, won. The two machines returned for the 1935 contest. The following year he was flying a G II RC in Olympic flights and in Belgium. In September 1934 a G II RC visited the UK at Lympne in an international competition. Flights like these attracted notice and the Gerner aircraft looked to sell well with clubs, justifying Adler Werke's investment. In the end only 53 production machines were completed, the majority G II RBs. Sales of the C variant were disappointing; the accidents may have played a part but there was also a move in the now nationally organised flying clubs towards aircraft with rather more powerful engines. thumbG II RC visiting Lympne, UK in 1934 Variants ;Gerner G II R: Single prototype with Salmson 9 Ad and BMW X radial engines. ;Gerner G II RB: Hirth HM 60 or Hirth HM 60R engine. 40 built. ;Adler-Gerner G II RC: Revised tank, swept wings, new undercarriage and empennage. 13 built.

Founded in 1995 to perform at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival, the company generally stages three or four productions each summer, giving up to 16 performances in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, and also touring. The company performs full-scale productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan works, with orchestra, using period settings and costumes. Since 2010, in addition to its performances at the festival, the company has generally performed one or more of its productions in an additional venue either before or after the festival. Since 2014, it has toured some of its productions to multiple British cities in repertory, giving up to 42 performances on tour. Background The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company performed Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy Operas continuously, year-round, for over a century, closing in 1982.Bradley, pp. 49‚Äì50; Joseph, p. 358. Between 1988 and 2003, a seasonal company used the name D'Oyly Carte. See Bradley, pp. 54‚Äì68Skow, John. 1982 \\"Music: Final Curtain for D'Oyly Carte\\". Time magazine, 8 March 1982, accessed 7 July 2010 Until the Gilbert and Sullivan copyrights expired in 1961, no other professional theatre or opera companies were allowed to present the Savoy Operas in Britain, although professional companies performed the operas in North America, Australia and elsewhere, and numerous amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies performed around the world. After 1961 other professional groups began to perform the operas in Britain.Bradley, chapters four and sixHewett, Ivan. \\"The Magic of Gilbert and Sullivan\\".

It is becoming increasingly popular in Albania and Macedonia. It is identified as part of the wider Pop-folk genre of the Southeastern Europe, which includes Chalga from Bulgaria, Skiladiko from Greece, Manele from Romania and Turbo-folk from Serbia. History Tallava originated in the 1980s and 1990s within the Albanian-speaking areas of Kosovo region, created by the Ashkali (Romani) ethnic minority community. The name is derived from Romani tel o vas, meaning \\"under the hand\\", referring to the Chochek dance where the hands are waved delicately. Kosovo Albanian refugees of the Kosovo War in the Republic of Macedonia had brought their music with them, including Tallava. It has since also been adopted by the non-Albanian-speaking Roma in Macedonia. Identity and reputation Tallava occupies an ambivalent place in popular consciousness; it is both celebrated and vilified by the wider Albanian community. In the minds of many, its Ashkali origins imbue it with a lower-class connotation, and it is often disparaged. However, tallava is extremely popular and considered by many necessary for any party, especially a wedding. Kosovo Roma musician Bajram Kafu Kinolli suggests that it is simple racism that gave tallava its low status: ‚ÄúBearing in mind that it was the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians who mostly cultivated tallava and that they are in a crisis in regard to presenting their culture‚Ä¶ some people label it as a degradation, especially today when the word ‚Äòtallava‚Äô is a dirty, filthy, and degrading term for anything in Kosovo.‚Äù Style and attributes Initially, tallava music was performed in cafes, and the def, a kind of tambourine, predominated. In the 1990s, other instruments like drums, bass guitar, guitar, accordion and clarinet were incorporated. Kafu Kinolli sees tallava as distinct from the wider turbo-folk umbrella genre in that whereas a turbo-folk song has a linear structure (e.g., verse-chorus-verse-chorus), tallava songs are longer, more improvisational, and without a definitive structure. However, this improvisational character leads other musicologists, such as Astrit Stafai, to believe that tallava does not constitute a genre in and of itself: ‚Äú... tallava is an improvisation of a certain moment, for example at a family- related or personal occasion. Tallava has neither a musical form nor development. It just doesn't have the proper concept to be a musical style‚Äù.

Built in the 19th century, the fortress was originally intended to protect the southern border of the Russian Empire. History The first fortress in the Kerch Strait was built in 1771. The first battery was built at the cape and later named Pavlovskij. Subsequently, the fort was rebuilt several times and armed.[Encyclopedia of Ukraine: Kerch During the Crimean War, the battery was equipped with 20 guns. The Treaty of Paris proclaimed the Black Sea as neutral zone and forbade Russia from placing their fleet or military ports in the area. However, the treaty allowed for the fortification of the Kerch Strait. In April 1856, Kerch combat units were sent to study local conditions and photograph locations. The experienced military engineer Colonel Anton Antonovich supervised the construction work, which also began in 1856. In October 1859, Eduard Ivanovich Totleben was appointed Director of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of War and gained the Tsar's support for strengthening Kerch. He drew on experience gained in the siege and defense of the fortress, as well as his defense of Sevastopol. In 1861, excavation work started at Ak-Burun cape. In 1861 emperor Alexander II visited the fortress for the first time. In 1867, Kerch fortress opened. When the Tsar visited the fortress in 1872, work on the defensive constructions was completed, and he was \\"very pleased with the finish of coastal batteries.\\"  USSR  During the existence of the Soviet Union, the fortress housed a military warehouse with equipment and ammunition for the Black Sea navy forces, as well as for a disciplinary battalion. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, military units began to disband. In 2003, the fortress territory was transferred to the Kerch State historical and cultural reserve. Twenty- first century The fort is protected by the State and is a landmark of Kerch and the Crimea.

The opening of the new station returned passenger rail service to Holyoke for the first time in 49 years, and to the Dwight and Main streets site for the first time in 130 years. A pilot program added two daily Amtrak Shuttle round trips in August 2019 under the Valley Flyer moniker. History The Connecticut River Railroad opened to passenger service between Springfield and Northampton in late 1845; trains reached Deerfield in August 1846, Greenfield in December 1847, and the junction with the Central Vermont Railway in January 1849. When the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad reached Brattleboro in 1850, the Connecticut River Railroad began running through service from Springfield to Brattleboro. Over the next century, the line was host to a mix of local and long-distance passenger and freight service. It became part of the route for numerous New York-Montreal trains as early as the 1860s, and was acquired by the Boston and Maine Railroad in 1893. =The original depot= The original depot, ca. 1880 The former station, ca. 1904 The former station in disrepair in 2016 Holyoke‚Äôs original train depot, which was located near Dwight and Main Streets, was a modest wooden structure that served both passenger and freight needs. The site of the original depot is today occupied by an automobile repair shop and dealership. =Connecticut River Railroad station= The Connecticut River Railroad Station was built in Holyoke in 1884-5 for the Connecticut River Railroad. Designed by the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson, it was one of the last in his series of Northeastern railroad stations. The station building, which is rectangular in shape, was originally designed with a double-height waiting room lit by high dormers. The building, which was constructed with granite and brownstone, included a slate covered hipped roof with multiple dormers. In 1965, with passenger service waning, the station was converted into a mechanical shop by Perry's Auto Parts. Long- distance service over the line ended in October 1966, with local service between Springfield and Brattleboro lasting several more months. In 1972, Amtrak began running the Montrealer, which ran along the line at night, stopping at Northampton but not Holyoke or Greenfield. The Montrealer was discontinued in 1987 due to poor track conditions on the line. Service resumed in 1989 after Amtrak seized control of the line in Vermont from the Boston and Maine Railroad, but the train was rerouted over the Central Vermont Railway through Massachusetts and Connecticut to avoid the still-dilapidated Conn River Line which Amtrak did not control. A stop was added at Amherst to replace Northampton. The Montrealer was replaced by the daytime Vermonter in 1995, using the original route through Connecticut but still avoiding the Conn River Line in Massachusetts. In 2004 the structure (along with Richardson's house in Brookline, Massachusetts) was cited as one of the ten most endangered historic sites in Massachusetts. In May 2009, as the building sat littered with graffiti and falling into disrepair, it was purchased from a private owner by the City of Holyoke's Gas & Electric department. Plans to repair the building did not at the time include allowing its use as a rail depot. In August 2014 the Holyoke Office of Planning & Economic Development issued a report detailing a number of potential new uses for the former Connecticut River Railroad station building. Proposed potential uses were divided into four broad themes: Food Uses, Collaborative Workspaces & Commercial Uses, Community & Cultural Uses and Academic Engagement & Educational Uses. On November 10, 2019, the station was sold to a private party for $10,000; no preservation plan was announced at that time. =Restoration of passenger service= Track work at the new station site in October 2014 In order to shorten travel times on the Vermonter and add additional local service to serve the populated Connecticut River Valley, the Pan Am Railways Conn River Line was rebuilt with $73 million in federal money and $10 million in state funds. The Vermonter was rerouted to the line on December 29, 2014 with new station stops in Northampton and Greenfield. A stop at Holyoke was originally planned to open with Northampton and Greenfield but later delayed. The city considered reactivating the former station building, but instead decided that a site at Dwight Street a block west provided a better place for a modern station design. The new Depot Square Railroad Station, which cost approximately $3.2 million, includes a -long high level platform, 170-foot- long canopy, and a waiting area and staircase facing Dwight Street. The station has a 25-space parking lot and loop for bus drop off and is fully handicapped accessible. The city first planned a one-car-length \\"mini-high\\" platform with a longer stretch of low platform, but changed to the longer high-level platform in 2014. The construction of the new station was funded by a $2 million MassWorks Infrastructure grant from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Construction for the station began in November 2014, and a formal groundbreaking was held on December 22, 2014, one week before the Vermonter was rerouted to the line. The station was then intended to open in April 2015, but construction took longer than expected. Depot Square Railroad Station opened on August 27, 2015. On August 30, 2019, Amtrak extended two daily New Haven‚ÄìSpringfield Shuttle round trips (branded as Valley Flyer) to Greenfield as a pilot program.

Evelita Juanita Spinelli (October 17, 1889 - November 22, 1941) nicknamed The Duchess, was the first woman to be executed by the state of California. She was a gangster and ex-wrestler. FBI profiler Candice DeLong described Spinelli as a \\"stone cold psychopath who had no use for anybody, other than what she could get out of them.\\" Young delinquent homeless men were regularly taken into her house. She would cook and clean for them and train them to be professional criminals. Her daughter, Gypsy, regularly used a honey trap to snare drunken men, who were consequently mugged. The men received a ten dollar weekly allowance, with Spinelli receiving the lion's share of their ill-gotten gains. Two of her protegees, Albert Ives and Robert Sherrod, killed Leland Cash during a mugging (when he reached into his pocket to turn up his hearing aid, Ives assumed he was reaching for a gun and shot Cash in the stomach). Fearing Sherrord would confess to the police, Spinelli gave him whiskey that she had laced with chloral hydrate. The gang then beat him up whilst he was unconscious. To make his death appear accidental, they threw him off the Clarksburg bridge on the Sacramento River, just south of Sacramento, wearing only swimming trunks. However, the autopsy showed there was no water in his lungs. Fearing for his own survival, Ives escaped and confessed to the police and was committed to Mendocino State Hospital for life. Spinelli was consequently arrested. Her gang members testified against her at her trial. She was described by a warden as \\"the coldest, hardest character, male or female, I have ever known, a homely, scrawny, nearsighted, sharp-featured scarecrow. . . . The Duchess was a hag, evil as a witch, horrible to look at, impossible to like.\\" She was executed November 22, 1941, at the age of 52, in the gas chamber, at San Quentin State Prison, San Quentin, California Her story was dramatized on TV in the Gang Busters episode,\\"The Duchess Spinelli Case\\".

As a prominent businessman, he established several companies responsible for the development of businesses and real estate in Morgantown, West Virginia. Swisher was born in 1870 near Levels, West Virginia. He became a schoolteacher there at the age of 18, then graduated from Fairmont State Normal School (present-day Fairmont State University) and West Virginia University. He then remained in Morgantown, where he established a bookstore and stationery shop. Following the success of his bookstore, Swisher organized the Main Street Building Company, the Howard L. Swisher Company, and the Morgantown Building Association, each of which constructed a large number of residences in the city. He was also the inaugural secretary-treasurer of the West Virginia Real Estate Dealers' Association. Swisher was secretary of the Royalty Oil Company, which owned mining rights for approximately of prospective oil lands throughout the United States. He also held prominent leadership and management roles in the Valley Wood Working Company, the Monongahela Valley Posting and Distributing Plant, the Federal Savings and Trust Company, and the West Virginia Tri-Products Company. In Hampshire County, Swisher maintained fruit growing interests and served as the president of the South Branch Merchandising Company. He was an active member of the West Virginia Democratic Party and was selected as a delegate from West Virginia to the 1936 Democratic National Convention. In 1897, Swisher co-authored History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present with West Virginia historian Hu Maxwell. The book was the first comprehensive history of Hampshire County ever compiled. He composed a collection of poetry and short stories, Briar Blossoms, in 1899, and was the editor of The Ghourki, a literary journal of poetry, short stories, and aphorisms. In 1908, Swisher published Book of Harangues, a selection of passages from The Ghourki.  Family background  Howard Llewellyn Swisher was born on September 21, 1870 near the unincorporated community of Levels, West Virginia. He was the son of David Warner Swisher and his wife, Mary Katherine Bonnifield Swisher. David was born in Augusta County, Virginia on April 29, 1822, and was of Swiss German and French ancestry. David moved to Preston County in present-day West Virginia in 1838, and a few years later, he purchased land near present-day Levels in Hampshire County and relocated there. He then established a farm on this land, known as \\"The Levels,\\" and remained there for the remainder of his life. The Swisher family owned and operated one of the largest orchard operations in the Levels community. In 1846, David married his wife, Mary Katherine Bonnifield, the daughter of Dr. Arnold Bonnifield of St. George, West Virginia.  Early life and education  Swisher spent his early years and adolescence on his father's farm, until he became a schoolteacher in Hampshire County at the age of 18. He began his post-secondary education at Fairmont State Normal School (present-day Fairmont State University) in Fairmont, which he graduated from in 1892. While enrolled there, Swisher became affiliated with the Mu Mu Chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Following his graduation, he traveled throughout the northwestern United States and the Canadian provinces and territories of Alberta, Assiniboia, British Columbia, and Manitoba. Swisher then moved to Fresno, California, where he worked as a public schoolteacher for two years. He then returned to West Virginia and attended West Virginia University in Morgantown. While at the university, he aspired to become a journalist and edited The Athenaeum, the institution's official student newspaper. In 1897, after three years of studies, Swisher graduated from the university with a Bachelor of Arts degree.  Business career  Swisher in 1903 As a prominent businessman, Swisher established several corporations and companies responsible for the development of businesses and commercial and residential real estate in Morgantown. He remained in Morgantown after his graduation from West Virginia University, and in 1897 with $700 in capital, he opened a book and stationery store known as the Acme Book Store. The business prospered, and in April 1898, Swisher established the Acme Publishing Company, which he served as president of for several years. Swisher subsequently organized the Main Street Building Company, which became responsible for building the Strand Building, a business and commercial block in Morgantown. He established and incorporated the Howard L. Swisher Company in November 1914. He also organized the Morgantown Building Association in November 1918 with an authorized capital of $250,000 and himself serving as its general manager. The Morgantown Building Association undertook extensive construction of residences in the city. In December 1914, following its organization in Parkersburg, Swisher was named the secretary- treasurer of the West Virginia Real Estate Dealers' Association. The association was formed in cooperation with the West Virginia Department of Agriculture and other state agencies for the promotion and development of the states's agricultural resources, real estate, and investments. Advertisement for Howard L. Swisher and Company, Inc. Land Merchants, 1918 In addition to his real estate and construction ventures, Swisher was an organizer and secretary of the Royalty Oil Company, which owned mining rights to approximately of prospective oil lands throughout the southern and southwestern United States. He built and operated the Swisher Theater in Morgantown. Swisher was also a director of the Valley Wood Working Company, the owner of the Monongahela Valley Posting and Distributing Plant, and the secretary of the Federal Savings and Trust Company prior to 1903. By 1913, he was the president of the West Virginia Tri-Products Company, which invested in coal and oil production, glass manufacturing, and the production of timber and fruit. Swisher maintained fruit growing interests on South Branch Mountain (known as Jersey Mountain) in Hampshire County, and served as the president of the South Branch Merchandising Company.  Writing career  During his travels, Swisher contributed articles and poetry to newspapers throughout the Northwest. While attending West Virginia University, he published a small book containing approximately 600 lines of poetry, which he dedicated to his classmates. In 1897, Swisher co-authored History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present with West Virginia historian Hu Maxwell. The book was the first comprehensive history of Hampshire County ever compiled. He composed a collection of poetry and short stories titled Briar Blossoms, which was published by his Acme Publishing Company in 1899. Swisher was the editor of The Ghourki, a literary journal of poetry, short stories, and aphorisms. He began each issue with an introductory commentary entitled \\"Harangues to the Ghourki\\" in which he referred to himself as the \\"Chief of the Tribe\\". In 1908, Swisher published Book of Harangues, a selection of passages from The Ghourki.  Politics  Portrait of Howard Llewellyn Swisher from Briar Blossoms (1899) Swisher was an active member of the West Virginia Democratic Party. In 1900, he was selected as a candidate for State Superintendent of Free Schools. In the 1902 general election, he ran as the Democratic candidate for the Eleventh District of the West Virginia State Senate. Despite his loss, Swisher received the largest number of Democratic votes ever amassed in Monongalia County up until that time. Swisher was a delegate at the 1936 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, and was selected as an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1912 and 1924.  Personal life  In August 1897, Swisher married Mary Dering of Morgantown, daughter of Edward A. Dering and his wife, Cordelia Walker Dering of Morgantown. Both the Dering and Walker families, from which Swisher's wife descended, had arrived in the Colony of Virginia during its earlier periods of settlement. Swisher was a member of the Morgantown Union Lodge No. 4 of the Free and Accepted Masons, Morgantown Lodge No. 411 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Morgantown Chamber of Commerce, the Kiwanis Club, the Country Club, and the Old Colony Club. Swisher served on the Old Colony Club's National Advisory Council. On August 27, 1945, Swisher died of a cerebral hemorrhage due to hypertension at his residence at 80 Donley Street in Morgantown. Swisher was interred on August 30, 1945 at Oak Grove Cemetery in Morgantown's Chancery Hill Historic District.

She was born to two of the largest landowners in Scotland, being the third daughter of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll and his wife Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower. A childhood bout of poliomyelitis caused paralysis and required her to wear leg braces for the rest of her life. In 1882, Lady Victoria experienced a \\"second consecration\\" and dedicated the rest of her life to helping those who lived on the islands throughout Argyll. She frequently visited the island of Tiree, where she championed social and religious organisations, and moved there in 1891. She also anonymously promoted the island, sending details of the plight of islanders in regular letters to the British press. In 1911 Victoria's sister Frances Balfour published a posthumous biography of her. Family and early life Lady Victoria Campbell was born at Carlton House, London on 22 May 1854, the third daughter and eighth child of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll by his first wife Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower. As such, the new baby was a member of the Campbell and Leveson-Gower families, two of the largest landowners in Scotland. She was named after Queen Victoria, the reigning monarch at the time of her birth. Her maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Sutherland, had been the Queen's friend and Mistress of the Robes. She was the only one of the twelve Campbell siblings who never married. Her relatives by marriage included Princess Louise, who was married to her eldest brother John. At the age of five Lady Victoria contracted poliomyelitis, which caused paralysis and required her to wear leg braces for the remainder of her life. From 1859 to 1868, her health required her to spend most of the year in London and Brighton, near her orthopaedist Matthias Roth. Victoria was often separated from her immediate family during these periods, though she was looked after by her unmarried aunt Emily MacNeill and her lifelong servant and companion Elizabeth Knowles. Despite this separation, Victoria was particularly close to her sister Frances Balfour, who in 1868 described Victoria's bedroom as \\"the centre of the fun and mischief that was going on in the family circle\\". Victoria underwent multiple treatments and surgeries to alleviate the paralysis in her legs, and after physical therapy she was eventually able to use crutches and walking sticks. Her sister Frances later observed that because Victoria's ailments occurred from an early age, it became \\"second nature\\" to cope and she rarely spoke of them. In 1868, at the age of 14 Victoria developed a lung abscess which almost caused her death; she continued to have chest infections for the rest of her life. That same year, the Duchess had a stroke which led to ten years of being nursed by her third daughter. After the Duchess's death in 1878, the strain of the many years of nursing may have been the cause of Victoria's nervous breakdown in 1878‚Äì79. Victoria then oversaw the management of her father's households until his remarriage in 1881. Philanthropy Iona Abbey, where Lady Victoria experienced a \\"second consecration\\". Despite her limited ability to walk, Victoria frequently visited poverty-stricken families on the island of Iona. During a visit to Iona Abbey in 1882, Victoria experienced a \\"second consecration\\" and thereafter dedicated herself to helping those who lived on the islands throughout Argyll. A plaque was later installed in the abbey that reads, \\"In this church and by this window Victoria, daughter of George, eighth Duke of Argyll, dedicated her life to the glory of God in the service of the people of these islands.\\" In 1885 she began taking lessons in Gaelic, which was spoken on all of the islands; she sometimes taught Bible classes in the language. She also supported the creation of art and crafts that were inspired by Celtic culture, and participated in a resurgence of interest in Celtic Christianity in Argyll; the Celtic craft entrepreneurs Alexander and Euphemia Ritchie of Iona were two of her pupils. =Tiree= Lady Victoria first viewed the island of Tiree in 1878, when travelling on her father's yacht. In 1886, she learned of a dispute between her father and the residents of Tiree, who had suffered recent economic hardship. The islanders wished for a farm to be converted into crofts, but the duke instead leased it to someone else. Local citizens prevented the new tenant from taking up the farm, causing at least eight men to be arrested. The historian Joan B. Huffman describes this event as \\"life- altering\\" for Victoria, as she increased her visits to the island and later moved there in 1891. On Tiree, Victoria championed social and religious organisations such as the YWCA, and organised soup kitchens. She also oversaw training for both men and women; the former learned crafts such as woodcarving while female residents were trained in needlework and lace-making. Lady Victoria promoted Tiree under the pseudonym 'Hebridean', sending details on the plight of islanders in regular letters to the British press. She was held in high esteem by residents, who admired her determination to reach the island even when bad weather made the journey dangerous. Near the end of her life, Victoria was instrumental in securing the construction of a new pier for Tiree. Travel to the island could be difficult and dangerous, as there was no adequate pier to gain access. Residents had repeatedly petitioned her father for help, only to be met with refusal; the duke decided he would not be the one to solely fund its construction, despite the danger travelling to Tiree meant for his daughter. A new pier was only built after his death; Victoria ultimately worked for twenty years to secure its construction, which occurred shortly after her death. She died on 6 July 1910 of influenza and pneumonia in Edinburgh, and was buried in Liberton Churchyard. In 1911 her sister Frances published a posthumous biography of Victoria.

Prior to the usage and minting of coins, the Viking economy was predominantly a bullion economy, where the weight and size of a particular metal is used as a method of evaluating value, as opposed to the value being determined by the specific type of coin.Williams, Gareth. ‚ÄúHistory - Ancient History in Depth: Viking Money.‚Äù BBC, BBC, 17 Feb. 2011, www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml By the ninth century, the Viking raids brought them into contact with cultures well familiarised with the use of coins in economies of Europe, hence influencing the Vikings own production of coins. Within Scandinavia itself, Vikings were aware of coins from various regions including the Islamic areas of the day, bringing further influence. Before minting of their own coinage, a flow of international coins provided the basis for an early economy with which to develop. Danish ruled kingdoms in the British Isles, known as the Danelaw, began to model their own coins on rulers in addition to various Christian imagery. Within Scandinavia, the adoption of particular coinages within each of the Danish, Swedish and Norwegian coinages became evident towards the late 990s.Silver Economy in the Viking Age, edited by James Graham-Campbell, and Gareth Williams, Taylor & Francis Group, 2007. ProQuest Ebook Central As with most coins of the period, including within the Danelaw, the majority of these were modelled on the rulers of these particular regions. Each kingdom had varying success with the introduction and consequent use of their own coinage. The finds of multiple silver hoards within the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, provide evidence of the types and design of coins of the various Viking rulers and kings and the influence of outside cultures. Such hoards include the Cuerdale (consisting of some 7000 coins) and Silverdale hoards in the UK.Williams, Gareth, and Leslie Webster. ‚ÄúThe Cuerdale Hoard.‚Äù History - Ancient History in Depth, BBC, 17 Feb. 2011, www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/cuerdale_01.shtml‚ÄúImportant Viking Hoard Highlights the Continuing Success of the Treasure Act and Portable Antiquities Scheme.‚Äù The Portable Antiquities Scheme, British Museum Office, 4 Jan. 2012, web.archive.org/web/20120104190948/finds.org.uk/news/stories/article/id/226 The majority of the Cuerdale hoard can be found in the British Museum. In addition, hoards found in Denmark and Sweden show a large proportion of Arabic coins, as well as other forms of bullion such as bracelets and jewellery.  Background and Bullion Economy  183x183px The early Viking age saw a predominantly bullion economy within society. Some suggest Scandinavian coins developed in the town of Ribe towards the early eighth century with evidence of Danish sceattas, however no archaeological remains of a particular mint have been found. The development of a bullion economy within the Viking Age saw goods exchanged for precious metals based on their weight and size as opposed to use of a particular type of coin. Silver was the most used metal within the economy as a means of trading. The silver was often weighed using lead weights and in order to safeguard people‚Äôs wealth, melted down to be shaped into various other forms (such as bracelets and other jewellery).‚ÄúDecorated Weight.‚Äù Waterford Museum of Treasures, www.waterfordtreasures.com/reginalds-tower/whats-inside/decorated-weight. Scales brought with traders allowed weights of such metals to be accurately accounted for, therefore allowing an easier system of exchange between parties within the Viking age prior to coinage. As well as these various precious metals being used as a means of exchange, precious metals became a symbol of power and wealth within society. Towards the ninth century, raids took Vikings into contact with various towns and villages around the North and Irish Sea. Naturally, following raids of foreign nations, the Vikings became more accustomed to and more involved in local politics and economics. As a result, silver being used as a method of payment became more influential.Graham- Campbell, J (2011). Silver economies, monetisation and society in Scandinavia, AD 800-1100. Aarhus University Press p.84 The various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms already had their own coinage in use, which was often used to pay Vikings off in attempts to avoid raids, not necessarily always being successful. In addition to the influence of Anglo-Saxon coins, about 35% of coins entering Scandinavia were of Oriental descent,Alcock, L (1991). From the Baltic to the Black Sea.

In following centuries, many coins were based on silver and their value determined by weight. These have been found to be few and minted at an unidentified site. Sweyn, along with Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvasson, had previously commanded the Viking invading force into England, leading to the enforcement of Danegeld (the English king √Üthelred II, was required to pay the Danish: known as Danegeld). The English coins used as payment became some of the early prototypes for these Danish coins.Skaare, Kolbjorn. ‚ÄúCoins and Mints.‚Äù Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopaedia, edited by Phillip Pulsiano and Kirsten Wolf, Garland Publishing, Inc., 1993, pp. 101‚Äì103. The main two developments common in Denmark became: pennies highly similar to those minted within England, but struck in Denmark with images of the English king and name; and also pennies modelled on those made in England but with images more directly linked to Denmark.Alcock, Leslie, and Brita Malmer. ‚ÄúChapter 9: What Does Coinage Tell Us about Scandinavian Society in the Late Viking Age? .‚Äù From the Baltic to the Black Sea: Studies in Medieval Archaeology, edited by David Austin, Routledge, 1997, pp. 162‚Äì164. During the reign of Svend Estridsen, many Danish coins had a strong imitation of Byzantine types and towards the latter part of his reign, pennies had impressions of Danish runic characters. Later between 1074 and 1080, under the reign of Harald Hen, Denmark moved more to a nationalised currency and coinage. The initial implementation of the Danish coinage began well, becoming further consolidated and established under the rule of Cnut, whereby the kingdoms of both Denmark and England were more united. Under Cnut in the 1020s came some of the first organised coinage, principally minted in Lund, but also found to be minted in multiple other cities such as Ribe, Hedeby and Aalborg. = Norway = As in other parts of Viking Scandinavia, imports of coinages and coins from various regions of the world, entered their way into present day Norway as a result of increased trade. Across the Viking lands about 150 finds of coins found approximately 400 Arabian, 3300 Norwegian and a similar number of English coins.Brita Malmer (1976) Coins and Coinage in Viking-Age Norway, Scandinavian Economic History Review, 24:2, 153-156, DOI: 10.1080/03585522.1976.10407850 Some of the earliest issued coins within Norway itself came from around the 990s and were designed with the image of Olaf Tryggvasson, the king of Norway from 995 to 1000. Locally issued coinage is likely to have continued within Norway, evidenced from the composition of multiple found coin hoards. Under the reign of King Harald Sigurdsson, after having gained knowledge and experience in currencies during his service with the Byzantine emperor, a national currency was established. Generally, the pennies were issued with an approximate weight of 0.89 grams. Initially, these coins contained a high amount of silver, but gradually silver was dropped in overall content with higher percentages of copper being used instead, (particularly under Olaf Haraldsson). Nidarnes is likely to have been the location of the main mint of Norwegian coins under the rule of Haraldsson. Initially, the distributed coinage within Norway, had a delicate start, but under the rule of Harald Hardrada, became much more influential.

From British Museum = Sweden = Coin of Olof Sk√∂tkonung, minted at SigtunaThe import of foreign coins into Sweden started around the year 800, continuing until approximately 1150 when the local minting of coins became more common. Predominantly, Islamic dirhams were imported into Sweden via Russia, with additional circulation coming from Germany, England and elsewhere. A high silver content was necessary providing weight standards for which to value the bullion. Sweden‚Äôs native coinage began towards the 990s with the king Olof Sk√∂tkonung, issuing coins with his own image and title. The royal coinage was mainly produced around the town of Sigtuna and based on English coinage. Finds have linked these coins to Sigtuna based on die links as well as relationships between the imagery. King Anund Jacob continued the minting of coins in Sigtuna but was discontinued towards the end of his reign. The minting was likely resumed under the reign of King Canute I.BLACKBURN, M., & CHOWN, J. (1984).

Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/42667385 Generally, the coinage was primitive in comparison to others of the period, with varying weight and meaningless inscriptions. These coins could have been used as a means of payment for soldiers as opposed to having a sole use in trading, resulting in this primitive type of coinage.Jonsson, Kenneth. ‚ÄúSmall Things - Wide Horizons.‚Äù Small Things - Wide Horizons, edited by Bertil Helgesson et al., Archaeopress Archaeology, 2015, pp. 51. Christian imagery and resemblances were common in early Swedish coinage, modelling Anglo-Saxon coinage including inscriptions such as ‚ÄòIN NOMINE DOMINI‚Äô, meaning ‚ÄòIn the name of the Lord‚Äô, as well as cross symbols.Silver Economy in the Viking Age, edited by James Graham-Campbell, and Gareth Williams, Taylor & Francis Group, 2007. ProQuest Ebook Central, p.194 Coinage from Sigtuna came to a conclusion around 1030.  Danelaw  Alfred the Great silver coin The Danelaw, a region located in present day United Kingdom which came under the rule of the Danes from approximately the 9th century to the 11th century, began to use coins influenced by the Danish. The earliest phases of coinage, under Viking rule were predominantly imitative of nearby coinages.Blackburn, Mark (2005). \\"Currency under the Vikings. Part I: Guthrum and the Earliest Danelaw Coinages\\". British Numismatic Journal. Few of these imitations modelled themselves on Viking rulers and kings, with many holding the name of King Alfred (king of the Anglo-Saxons) and being struck to a weight standard of approximately 1.6g. The minting of many of these coins, continued on from Anglo-Saxon production prior to invasion through to the 870s and 880s, but with some signs of Scandinavian rule. The mid 890s saw a development in the introduction and development of national coinages within the two main kingdoms of the Danelaw. York saw the regal coinages with names of rulers Siefred and Cnut, while East Anglia replaced the coinage of King Alfred to St Edmund.Blackburn, M. (2006). \\"Currency under the Vikings. Part II: The Two Scandinavian Kingdoms of the Danelaw, c. 895-954\\", British Numismatic Journal 76 (2006) The St Edmund coinage often displayed signs Christian imagery. The earliest known coins from Vikings in the kingdom of York came from Guthred. Evidence suggests it is of Anglo-Saxon type, bearing king‚Äôs name, a cross and the moneyer‚Äôs name.Gooch, M.L. (2012). Money and Power in the Viking Kingdom of York, c. 895-954, University of Durham unpublished PhD thesis, 2012. Pp.43-109 The coinages of Cnut and Siefred also rely on regal and Christian imagery as well as influences from the Byzantine coins. Christian imagery was common in coins issued in the Danelaw kingdom. This includes inscriptions such as DOMINUS DEUS REX (Lord God and King) as well as Christian imagery such as the Christian cross. Scandinavian influences on the coinages are also evident in addition to the Christian imagery, such as the hammer of the Norse god Thor and other references. The inscriptions under King Olaf demonstrate Scandinavian influence. Many of the Viking coins that display images of Thor and Odin are accompanied with Christian symbols as well, while the use of Old Norse developed a distinctive line of coins apart from Anglo-Saxon kings.

Hoards and Viking coins today  Many of the hoards found regarding Viking coins date between the 9th and 11th centuries come from the British Isles. The finds can often be found in museums such as the British Museum and consist mostly of silver goods.‚ÄúThe Silver Hoards of the Vikings.‚Äù National Museum of Denmark, National Museum of Denmark, en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric- period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-silver-hoards-of-the-vikings/ Some of the silver hoards found within Denmark include 1751 coins from Terslev with 1708 of these coins being of Arabian descent. The latest issue of coins found within this hoard came from the year 944. Other hoards found within Denmark, consist of pendants, strap fittings, bracelets, silver beads and silver fragments. These include hoards from Duesminde and Vedsted which can be found at the National Museum of Denmark. There also existed some gold hoards such as finds in Hornelund which are also at the National Museum of Denmark. In Sweden, two thirds of coin finds come from Gotland with finds of approximately 259 524 coins from the Viking Age across all of Sweden.Jonsson, K. (2015). Viking Age coins found in Sweden.

Archaeopress. doi:10.2307/j.ctvr43jxs.10 In addition to those in Gotland, significant finds have been made on the island of Oland, off the Swedish coast. Eighth and ninth century coins found here are generally made up of Arabic coins mostly. By the eleventh century, hoards finds reduced, with a higher proportion of western European coins.Thurborg, M.

The majority of coins show Alfred the Great, with others having the name of Guthrum, Guthfrith and other uncertain coins.Blackburn, Mark (1989). \\"The Ashdon (Essex) Hoard and the Currency of the Southern Danelaw in the Late Ninth Century\\". British Numismatic Journal Four of the coins found in the hoard are located within the British Museum with the rest in Fitzwilliam Museum, and two in the Saffron Walden Museum. One of the largest Viking silver hoards found is the Cuerdale Hoard, consisting of approximately 8600 items including silver coins, and weighing around 40 kg. The composition of the coins likely suggest that it was buried between 905 and 910. Of the items found, there are approximately 7000 coins, mainly being of Anglo-Saxon and Danelaw issue. In addition to these coins, some international Frankish coins were present as well as early Scandinavian coins. The Byzantine and Scandinavian coins would likely have come from Scandinavia in transition to Britain. As well as the coins found in the hoard, over 36 kg was bullion, mainly consisting of silver jewellery and other smaller metals. The majority of the find, can presently be found in the British Museum. The Silverdale Hoard found in Silverdale, Lancashire consists of around 27 coins, and in total 200 pieces of jewellery.‚ÄúSilverdale Viking Hoard Examined by British Museum.‚Äù (2011) BBC News, BBC, www.bbc.com/news/uk-england- lancashire-16178699‚ÄúImportant Viking Hoard Highlights the Continuing Success of the Treasure Act and Portable Antiquities Scheme.‚Äù (2012-01-04).

It is headed by the superior commander of the national guard.  History  The National Guard was first created in 1963 as the Republican Guard under the presidency of President Diori Hamani. Due to its loyalty to President Hamani, following the 1974 coup by President Seyni Kountche, it was restructured to ensure loyalty to Seyni Kountche. During those years, the guard was primarily tasked of protecting the president and was made up of elite soldiers trained by Moroccan officers. After the 1995 peace agreements between the government of Niger and the Touareg rebel groups, it was restructured and renamed to \\"Forces Nationales d'Interventions and Securite (FNIS)\\". Ex-rebel members were reinserted into this body as per the terms of the peace agreements. Previously under the authority of Ministry of Defense, the national guard was transferred under the authority of the Ministry of Interior in 2003. Faithful to their tradition, the National Guard remained loyal to President Tandja Mamadou in his attempt to prolong his presidency beyond the constitutional limits of his term. Later, during the 2010 military coup, the National Guard unsuccessfully defended President Tandja Mamadou. In 2010 and 2011, several government decrees and ordinances proceeded to its reorganization and renaming to the National Guard of Niger.

Kiernan is the editor of the Electronic Beowulf and an acknowledged expert on the Beowulf manuscript. Kiernan is the T. Marshall Hahn Sr. Professor of Arts and Sciences Emeritus at the University of Kentucky. He was inducted into the University of Kentucky College of Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame in 2015. Academic interests Kiernan is active in the study of Beowulf and the Beowulf manuscript, and in the digital humanities, which combined in his Electronic Beowulf. From early on in his academic career, Kiernan expressed doubt in received theory on the poem and the manuscript, and at this time, the early 1980s, the dating of the Beowulf manuscript was an important topic in Anglo- Saxon scholarship. In general, Kiernan argued in Beowulf and the Beowulf manuscript, a monograph which attracted much attention, scholars have emended the manuscript too easily and have thus place too little faith in its readings. Theories of lengthy oral transmission of the poem have caused scholars to emend individual readings, even filling up what they perceived as lacunae in the text if they deemed that the metrics or the contents were faulty. Kiernan argued that the poem (whose sole surviving manuscript is reliably dated to around 1000 CE) is most likely from the early 11th century, rather than the late 10th century, and may well have been contemporary. That is to say, its scribes, rather than slavish and sometimes sloppy copyists of an earlier text, could have been close to a contemporary poet who created or recreated the poem. Kiernan sees the conquest of the English by Danish prince Cnut the Great in 1016 as a reason for the overwhelming interest in the Danish throne displayed in the poem. In addition, he claimed that the language used in the poem was very much a contemporary language rather than the archaic language claimed by earlier editors and critics. The latter point was supported by a linguistic analysis done by Joseph Tuso, who compared the poem's diction with three important contemporary texts. Kiernan's proposed 11th-century origin of the poem did not go unchallenged, but even critics such as Joseph Trahern who didn't accept this proposition praised Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript as \\"an impressive and valuable book that provides a wealth of paleographic and codicological information, [which] corrects a good deal of earlier scholarship, and clarifies a number of questions concerning the manuscript through a new and first-hand description of it\\". Reviewing Kiernan's monograph together with The Dating of Beowulf (a collection of essays including one by Kiernan, edited by Colin Chase, 1981), Trahern concluded that the two books narrowed the dating for Beowulf and pushed it closer to the actual production of the manuscript. A further critique of accepted scholarship on the manuscript came with The Thorkelin Transcripts of Beowulf in 1986, which challenged the traditional account of the transcriptions made for and by Gr√≠mur J√≥nsson Thorkelin, an Icelandic-Danish scholar who was the first to transcribe the manuscript in the British Museum. The received history had been Kemp Malone's, who had criticized the first of these two transcriptions, made by a clerk of the museum in 1787; according to Malone, that clerk (James Matthews, identified by Kiernan) had made many errors. Kiernan, however, after extensive research in the Danish National Archives in Copenhagen, argued that Matthews's lack of knowledge of Old English in fact was a bonus: since he came to the manuscript without prejudice, he copied what he saw, and any errors he made were systematic misreadings. Thorkelin, however, had a knack of attempting to read (that is, interpret) what he saw, thereby silently amending what he considered to be faulty readings. Thorkelin A (as Matthews's version is now called) is therefore much more reliable than Thorkelin B, and in addition comparison between A and B indicates the ongoing deterioration of the manuscript, whose edges had been charred during the 1731 fire at the Cotton library, then in the Ashburnham House. Tom Shippey, in a review of Kiernan's book, called it \\"an essential tool, now, for the study of the poem\\". Electronic Beowulf Electronic Beowulf is a digital facsimile edition of the poem, and the project was started by Kiernan and Paul Szarmach (of Western Michigan University) as part of the effort of the British Library, which holds the manuscript, of increasing access to its holdings. It uses fiber optics and an electronic camera; the goal of these technologies was to render visible the many letters and parts of letters obscured by the damage done to the manuscript in the 1731 fire. Ultra-violet light is used to verify erasures by scribes. Kiernan edited the electronic edition, published by the British Library and available on CD- ROM since the second and third editions (2011); the first was published in 1999 as a free download. It contains high-definition images and a hypertext dictionary, as well as four early transcriptions and a modern one, plus an edition of the text; the early transcriptions are the two made for and by Thorkelin (late 1780s), John Josias Conybeare (1817), and Frederic Madden (1824). Comparison between the transcriptions shows the ongoing deterioration of the charred and brittle edges of the manuscript. A reviewer of the third edition for the Digital Medievalist noted that while \\"this new update offers Old English researchers and students a wealth of resources‚Äîand beautiful new high-resolution images\\", its interface, using HTML and JavaScript code and Java applets is \\"rather dated\\", a critique already offered for the second edition by William Kilbride of the University of York. Nonetheless, Kilbride noted, \\"the effort to achieve this has been phenomenal, but the result is truly staggering. Beowulf scholars and students of Old English now have unimaginable riches at their fingertips\\". Education Kiernan received his bachelor's in English from Fairfield University in 1967 and both his master's and doctorate in medieval studies from Case Western Reserve University in 1970.

W. Hooper and also colloquially as Ned, was aide-de-camp on the staff of Union Generals Rufus Saxton, Department of the South and John Adams Dix, Department of the East during the American Civil War from 1862 to 1865. Hooper also served as private secretary to General Saxton, during which time he was given the rank of Captain. He was also post commander and military governor in the South Carolina Sea Islands. Subsequently, he became steward (from 1872 to 1874) and later treasurer (from 1876 to 1898) of Harvard College. Life and family Edward William Hooper was the son of Ellen Sturgis (1812‚Äì1848) and Robert W. Hooper (1810‚Äì1885) and the grandson of William Sturgis. His siblings were Marian \\"Clover\\" Hooper Adams (September 13, 1843 ‚Äì December 6, 1885) an American socialite, active society hostess and arbiter of Washington, D.C., and accomplished amateur photographer and Ellen Sturgis \\"Nella\\" Hooper (1838‚Äì1887), who married professor Ephraim Whitman Gurney (1829‚Äì1886).

The name of the rancho derives from Saint Anthony the Abbot. History = Origin = The origin of this rancho is obscure, but was one of the earliest ranchos established around San Diego. It is mentioned in a report in 1828, with the various ranchos of the San Diego region, Pennasquitos, de la Naci√≥n (then the rancho of the Presidio of San Diego), San Ysidro, El Rosario and Temescal. Among them is also mentioned that of San Antonio Abad as a rancho with 300 cattle, 80 horses, 25 mules and some grain fields on it. It may have been a second rancho belonging to or used by the Presido. William Ellsworth Smythe, San Diego and Imperial counties, California: a record of settlement, organization, progress and achievement, Volume 1, The S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, 1913, p.112 The property of the Rancho San Antonio Abad would have been bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, to the south by the 11 league Rancho El Rosario and from 1829 it would have been bounded on the east by the Rancho T√≠a Juana. It would later in 1833, be bounded on the north by the Rancho Melijo or Rancho de La Punta of Santiago E. Arguello, that lay from the line of hills south of the Tijuana River valley on the coast north to the San Diego Bay. San Antonio Abad's location would put it below the modern Mexican border along where El Camino Real ran north along the coast to San Diego. Later in 1836-37, during the time of the Kumeyaay warfare against the ranchos, this rancho was being administered along with the Rancho Otay, by the same Santiago E. Arguello of Rancho Meilijo, son of Santiago Arguello owner of the Rancho T√≠a Juana (that had been abandoned at that time due to the raids), indicating it may not yet have been in private hands at that time.

A map of the Rancho Melijo made by a county surveyor for its land commission case, indicates that the line of hills extending along the border south of the Tijuana River and down the coast into Mexico, were known as the San Antonio Hills, perhaps indicating the northern limit of the Abad rancho.

On January 2, 1856, Santiago Arguello signed a sworn statement about the legal validity of the Mexican title of the San Pascual Rancheria. At the end of the document he signed it with a statement that indicated that he was the owner and resided at the rancho San Antonio Abad: :\\"Given in my rancho of San Antonio Abad a Ti Juan. S.

Family came from Hampshire. Educated Winchester and Cambridge. MP for Tynemouth in 1900. Frederick Leverton Harris (17 December 1864 ‚Äì 14 November 1926) was a British businessman and Conservative Party politician. He sat in the House of Commons for three periods between 1900 and 1918. His role in Parliament was largely insignificant until World War I, when he used his knowledge of shipping to play a crucial role in the United Kingdom's economic warfare against the German Empire, and joined the government in 1916 in a newly created post with specific responsibility for the blockade of Germany. As the war drew to a close, his political career looked set to flourish, but was destroyed by scandal.  Early life and family  Harris was the son of Frederick William Harris and his wife Elizabeth n√©e Wylie, of London and Withyham, East Sussex. He was educated at Winchester College and then Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1884. The following year he became a partner in coal-factoring and ship-owning business of Harris & Dixon in London, and he later became a director of the National Discount Company and the Metropolitan Electricity Supply Company. In 1886, he married Gertrude Richardson, from Bessbrook, County Armagh. They had no children.  Political career  He was elected at the 1900 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) Member of Parliament for Tynemouth, and supported the tariff reform campaign of his friend Joseph Chamberlain. He was appointed to the Tariff Reform Commission. In October 1902 he was appointed Parliamentary private secretary (unpaid) to H. O. Arnold-Forster, Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty. He was defeated at the 1906 election, but in May 1907 he was selected as the Unionist candidate for a vacancy in the Stepney division of Tower Hamlets, in London, following the resignation of Sir William Evans-Gordon. At the by-election on 10 May, he won the seat in a two- way contest with a Liberal-Labour candidate, Ben Cooper, Secretary of the Cigar Makers' Union. In the same year he was elected as a Municipal Reform Party candidate to the London County Council for Stepney, and was returned to Parliament by Stepney in January 1910. For health reasons, he did not defend his seat in December 1910, but he returned to Parliament 4 years later. After the death of his friend Joseph Chamberlain, his son Austen Chamberlain (whose first son was Harris's godson) resigned his East Worcestershire seat to contest his father's old seat of Birmingham West. Harris contested and won the resulting East Worcestershire by-election on 16 July, just weeks before the outbreak of World War I. He then became a commercial adviser to the trade division of the Admiralty, and in 1916 moved to the Foreign Office as Director of the Restriction of Enemy Supplies Department. He became a privy councillor in January, and in December he joined the government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Blockade. The East Worcestershire constituency was to be abolished for the 1918 general election, and Harris had been selected as the Conservative candidate for the new Moseley division of Birmingham. However, he and his wife faced public criticism for their role in wartime. During the war, she had visited Baron Leopold von Plessen, who was interned as an alien. Von Plessen was of British-Austrian dual nationality, and his mother was a friend of Mrs Harris. She strongly denied allegations that she had ever carried him parcels or letters for him, and was supported by Austen Chamberlain, who also defended her husband against suggestions that his business had profited from his role in government. However, Harris feared that the election would be fought on personal grounds, and on 16 October he withdrew his candidacy. When the war ended he withdrew from public life.  Retirement  Harris had lived at Camilla Lacey near Dorking in Surrey, but the house burned down in 1914. In about 1920 he took up painting, and in 1925 exhibited 50 oil paintings at the Goupil Gallery. He died suddenly on 14 November 1926 at his home in Grosvenor Street, London, aged 61.

It was first released by James Taylor's brother Alex Taylor on his 1971 album With Friends and Neighbors and as the lead single from the album. It was also released by James Taylor later that year on his album Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon. Lyrics and music Taylor wrote \\"Highway Song\\" in 1970 and he began playing it in live concerts during 1970, well before the release on Mudslide Slim and the New Horizon. Rolling Stone critic Ben Gerson contrasts \\"Highway Song\\" with another song on Mudslide Slim and the Blue Horizon, \\"Mud Slide Slim,\\" by noting that \\"Highway Song\\" provides \\"a more philosophical, realistic analysis\\" by acknowledging that \\"a person chooses his circumstances as much as circumstances choose him.\\" The song describes a journey, in which the highway represents punishment but also, according to Gerson, \\"has an , sinister allure.\\" According to Taylor biographer Timothy White, the song was inspired by the difficult traveling Taylor had to do now since becoming a star musician with the release of his first two albums, as well his own confusion about being the center of attention in his family at the time his brothers and sister were also embarking on musical careers. Los Angeles Times columnist Dan Neil links Taylor's \\"Highway Song\\" with Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\" as songs of \\"wanderlust,\\" in which the road is used as a metaphor for the replacement of adventure and faith for security and certainty. Author Grace Lichtenstein described Gram Parson's \\"Grievous Angel\\" as being a \\"first cousin\\" to \\"Highway Song\\" in its \\"lament about purposelessness and need for love.\\" The lyrics begin with the lines \\"Father let us build a boat and sail away/There's nothing for you here/And brother let us throw our lot out upon the sea/It's been done before.\\" Gerson describes this as \\"a brief, Biblical introduction, as if Noah were preparing for the Deluge.\\" White regards this introduction as a continuation of a theme from Taylor's earlier song \\"Country Road,\\" in which problems are resolved by going away. Another line from the song is \\"Sweet misunderstanding won't you leave a poor boy alone.\\" This line referred to many misunderstandings that were accumulating around Taylor in his first exposure to fame, and particularly the misunderstanding by many listeners that the line \\"Won't you look down upon me Jesus\\" from his popular song \\"Fire and Rain\\" was meant in a fundamentalist Christian context. Gerson points out that although the lyrics refer to traveling on the highway. the title \\"Highway Song\\" refers to a song he says he heard along the way, and not to the lyrics of the song itself, making this a metasong. A simple, repeated figure (music) predominates the melody. According to Gerson, this \\"contributes to the sense of Sisyphean doom.\\" Gerson also points out that the song's \\"swooping bass line,\\" played by Leland Sklar on James Taylor's recording, also contributes to the song's sense of inescapable despair. Billboard described \\"Highway Song\\" as one of James Taylor's best songs. Critic Al Rudis described it as \\"great\\" song, while preferring Alex Taylor's version to James'. Alex Taylor version Alex Taylor released \\"Highway Song\\" on With Friends and Neighbors and as a single prior to the release of his brother James' version. Billboard predicted that the single would perform well on the Billboard Hot 100 despite being Taylor's debut single. It did get strong radio play on some stations, such as WNUR-FM. Alex' version excludes the opening lines from James' version about the father and brother sailing out to sea. Rolling Stone critic Timothy Crouse stated that Alex's singing of the \\"Sweet misunderstanding won't you leave a poor boy alone\\" line revealed his \\"blues streak.\\" Rudis preferred Alex's version to James' on the basis of its greater passion and what Rudis regarded as a \\"nicer ending.\\" Tuscaloosa News editor Ben Windham compared Alex's version to Brook Benton's rendition of \\"Rainy Night in Georgia,\\" citing the \\"deep soul singing, sparse instrumental backing\\" and its use of string instruments. Fred Kirby of Billboard described it as having a \\"rustic blues feel.

The militant organisation Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) initially claimed responsibility for the attack. According to state media, the attackers were foreigners of Uzbek origin who belonged to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an Al Qaeda-linked militant organisation that works closely with TTP.Drone strike in Pakistan days after airport attack, sources say. CNN. The TTP later confirmed that the attack was a joint operation they executed with the IMU, who independently admitted to having supplied personnel for the attack. Following the attack, the Pakistani military conducted a series of aerial strikes on militant hideouts in the tribal areas along the Afghan border. At least 25 militants were killed on 10 June, including foreign fighters. Two drone attacks on 12 June also killed Uzbek, Afghan and some local militants. On 15 June, the Pakistani military intensified air strikes in North Waziristan, and bombed eight foreign militant hideouts. At least 105 insurgents were reported killed, a majority of whom were Uzbeks, including those linked to the airport attack. Some other foreign militants were also reported killed. According to military sources, a key Uzbek commander and mastermind of the attack, Abu Abdur Rehman Almani, was killed in the operation. These military responses culminated in Operation Zarb-e-Azb, a comprehensive Pakistan Armed Forces operation against militants in North Waziristan. Background Jinnah International Airport is Pakistan's largest and busiest airport, and serves as the hub for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the national flag carrier of Pakistan. Many domestic and international flights transit through the airport daily. This attack was the first large- scale incident in the airport in years, with the last major incident being the hijacking of the Pan Am Flight 73 in 1986.

In the letter, she complained that her husband spent much of the time pursuing Princess Yaza Datu Kalaya, and that when she confronted him about the matter, he pushed her to the bedpost.

After Victoria‚Äôs Secret launched its VS Sport line, the women‚Äôs clothing and lingerie company partnered with Misfit to produce a VS- inspired pink Shine. In 2015, Misfit announced a partnership with Swarovski to launch a Swarovski Shine Collection that combines Swarovski‚Äôs crystal jewelry with Misfit‚Äôs Shine. The line has two wearable products, one of which is the first solar-powered activity tracker produced by Misfit. The wearables are both waterproof and the line also has nine additional accessories all jointly designed by both companies. Misfit partnered with Speedo in 2015 to release the Speedo Shine, a water resistant activity tracker that can monitor a swimmer's laps in a pool, as well as other daily activities and sleep. Products =Shine= The Shine is the flagship product produced by Misfit. It is an activity tracker, made of aircraft grade aluminum that gives users insights into how much they are moving and sleeping. Misfit released a companion iPhone app to track fitness goals to coincide with Shine's launch. In December 2013, Misfit released its Shine Android app. Shine is capable of tracking a variety of activities including walking, running, cycling, swimming and sleeping. Shine also tracks sleep depth. Shine is about the size of two quarters and can be worn in a variety of ways, including a wristband, necklace or attached to clothing via a magnetic clip. It is water resistant up to fifty meters and does not require charging. In November 2015, Shine 2 was launched. The second generation device is thinner than its predecessor, has a different type of lights on its face, and adds the ability to configure vibrating alarms and notifications, but otherwise maintains the same features and battery life. =Flash= The Flash is the second activity tracker product produced by Misfit. It is made of soft touch plastic that come in seven colors. The Flash is a lower-priced and more casual wearable compared to the Shine, but has similar capabilities such as tracking steps, sleep, cycling and calories burned. Initial versions were labelled as being \\"Waterproof\\" and listed swimming as a trackable activity, however later versions are \\"Water Resistant\\" and no longer support swim tracking. The activity information is also paired with a mobile app. In July 2015, Misfit launched the Link, a squeezable clicker, with activity tracking features making it similar to the Flash without a wristband. It connects to the Misfit app, becoming a remote control for the applications functions such as pausing a song. This remote control functionality, referred to by Misfit as a \\"Smart Button\\", was retroactively added to the Flash, and has been included in every subsequent fitness tracker sold by Misfit including the Ray, Shine 2 and Flare, as well as the Phase, Path and Command hybrid devices. In 2017, Misfit launched the Flare, a fitness tracker with similar features to the Flash, which occupies the lowest price point in Misfit's product lineup after the Flash was discontinued. Its user interface is more sparse than the Flash, with a single LED which flashes different patterns depending on how close the wearer is reaching their daily goal. = Ray = The Ray is the most minimalist and versatile tracker. It automatically tracks steps, distance, light and restful sleep. It is a non‚Äêcharging tracker with replaceable batteries lasting up to 4 months. It is water resistant. There are 11 colors and 4 options for wearable style: sport band, leather band, bangle and necklace. There is a customization option as well as packaged sets. This line was discontinued in 2018. =Vapor= The Vapor is an Android Wear-based smartwatch which was launched in early 2017 and made available for ordering from select countries on 31st October 2017. The watch was originally reported to come with Misfit's own software and integrated GPS and NFC chips for mobile payment but the design was later changed to be based on Android Wear 2.0 and that the GPS and NFC chips were no longer present. The watch is available in four colours and has interchangeable straps of different types and colours. It features a unique Virtual Touch Bezel that can be used to navigate between apps on the watch. While integrated GPS is no longer part of the watch, it still has a strong focus on fitness use with heart-rate sensor and support for connected GPS (where it uses the GPS of the connected phone) and it is swimproof and water resistant to 50 metres. = Phase, Command, and Path = Misfit introduced the Phase in late 2016. Marketed as a hybrid smartwatch, it features a mechanical analog watch face together with Misfit's typical suite of step, activity, sleep tracking and Smart Button capabilities. It also includes an alarm and notification system, with vibrating alerts and a small circular slot in the watch face which can turn a variety of different background colours depending on the type of notification. The hour and minute hands can also be prompted to serve as a progress indicator towards the user's daily activity goals, and they can move to predetermined locations when vibration alerts occur to provide additional detail about the notification. Following up on the Phase, Misfit introduced the Command in 2017. Unlike the Phase, the Command has a separate mechanical dial (instead of the notification slot) which normally displays the user's current activity progress, and can also help identify vibration alerts. The Path is Misfit's third hybrid mechanical watch and fitness tracker, released in 2018. Omitting both the Command's separate progress/notification dial and the Phase's color-coded notification slot, it only includes mechanical hour and minute hands, used to indicate the time-of-day, identify vibration notification alerts, and display the user's activity progress. =Connected Home= Misfit has several smart home products such as the Beddit Sleep Monitor, a sleep-monitoring strip that fits over a mattress, as well as the Bolt Smart Bulb, a wirelessly-connected color-changing light bulb. The Bolt Smart Bulbs also function as alarm clocks that can be connected to Misfit‚Äôs sleep-monitoring devices such as Shine, Flash or Beddit. The lightbulbs support color combinations that create light-scapes resembling sunsets, sunrises, bright days, or other scenes. Misfit Home includes a mobile app for iOS and Android operating systems as well as additional smart-home capabilities such as wireless controls for lights, locks and thermostats.

It belongs to Rhineuridae, a family that includes many other extinct North American amphisbaenians but only one living species, Rhineura floridana, from Florida. Dyticonastis rensbergeri occurs the farthest west of all rhineurid species. Like all rhineurids, Dyticonastis has a shovel-like snout adapted for burrowing underground, but it differs from most other members of the group in having a relatively shallow angle to its snout wedge (about 30 degrees) and in having a widened snout tip. The only other rhineurids that share these features are species of the genus Spathorhynchus, which lived from the Middle Eocene to the Early Oligocene in what is now Wyoming. A 2007, phylogenetic analysis of amphisbaenians found that Dyticonastis and Spathorhynchus are each other's closest relatives, suggesting that both taxa may have evolved through vicariant speciation; the growth of the Rocky Mountains during the earliest stages of the Laramide orogeny in the early Paleogene would have separated North American rhineurids into eastern and western populations, with the western population producing Dyticonastis and Spathorhynchus.

The two then went to Merv, where the Samanid ruler Nuh I was preparing a counter-attack against Abu 'Ali Chaghani, who had taken control over the Samanid capital of Bukhara and put Ibrahim ibn Ahmad on the throne.

In 949, Mansur wrested Ray from the Buyid ruler Rukn al-Dawla, who was at that time in Shiraz and was ensuring his son's succession. Mansur then marched towards Isfahan, and had the city plundered. However, Rukn al-Dawla then marched towards Mansur, and a battle shortly ensured, which resulted in the rout of Mansur's army.

The phrase was formulated by US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles during the Cold War in the 1950s chiefly in the context of the Soviet Union, but has not subsequently featured in official discussions of US policy in China. Chinese analyses of US foreign policy, however, hold that it has constituted part of the theoretical foundation for US relations with the People's Republic of China since then. According to the thesis, the United States maintains a strategy to infiltrate and subvert socialist countries, notably China, by spreading Western political ideas and lifestyles, inciting discontent, and encouraging groups to challenge the party leadership. The US thus hopes that the process, according to Chinese readings of the alleged policy, will cause socialist system to be transformed from within. The Communist Party of China (CPC) has resisted the idea of Peaceful Evolution when the idea was first raised in the Mao era. The party sees such a process as \\"the biggest threat to its continuous rule.\\" Successive generations of party leaders have struggled against the Peaceful Evolution theory, including Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Hu Jintao, and Jiang Zemin. The theory is not currently part of official US policy approach to China, but Chinese military strategists consider it a cause of ongoing concern.  Origins  The precise locution \\"peaceful evolution\\" was a modification, by John Foster Dulles, of the doctrine originally outlined by George F. Kennan, who, in his Long Telegram of February 22, 1946, proposed that the socialist and capitalist blocs could reach a state of \\"peaceful coexistence.\\" This was augmented by Dulles over a decade later, in speeches of 1957‚Äì58, to \\"promoting peaceful evolution towards democracy.\\" In a speech, Dulles referred to \\"the use of peaceful means\\" to \\"accelerate the evolution of government policies within the Sino-Soviet bloc\\" in order to \\"shorten the expected life span of communism.\\" Western assistance and commerce were said to be two of the chief instruments of this plan to create a more liberal government in China. According to Bo Yibo (father of ousted Politburo member Bo Xilai) Mao Zedong heard about Dulles's remarks and took them seriously, ordering top Party cadres to study the speeches. Mao saw the idea of Peaceful Evolution as a serious policy threat, a \\"much more deceptive tactic\\" to corrupt China, and a war against the socialist powers by military means. Mao felt that the war was already being waged, with some effect, against the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Chinese communists became more concerned about the strategy.  Uses of the term  The term Peaceful Evolution has been used in the context of China and modernization outside the sphere of international relations. Scholars of China's media environment have used it to refer to the marketization of the press in China, where state control by the Communist Party lessens while the forces of commercialization take hold‚Äîthough whether the media sphere in China has really evolved along such lines is disputed. While Peaceful Evolution ideas are often attributed to the foes of China, observers have suggested that some officials in the Chinese communist system‚Äîsuch as Wen Jiabao‚Äîsupport the process. These allegedly reform-oriented officials, however, are not considered part of the Communist Party's mainstream. Scholars have argued that the typical Chinese uses of the term‚Äîas a conspiratorial plot‚Äîare too \\"vague and all embracing; its meaning ranges from dark conspiracies involving the alleged plotters of the counter revolutionary rebellion [a reference to the Tiananmen Square massacre] to the broad spectrum of cultural, social, and economic exchanges with the outside world.\\" The overall utility of the term for Chinese analysts is that it sums up a range of the threats to the regime's political security, faced by the Party in the post-Cold War era. These threats are mostly connected with the United States, and are seen as part of the United States' own foreign policy after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the term is now often used by Chinese scholars to condemn any foreign activities (including cultural, economic, social) that are seen as problematic for the Communist Party‚Äînot just those that are actually intended to undermine it. It is also used to dismiss out of hand United States criticism on the Chinese government's human rights record, on the theory that the West is simply attempting to undermine the Chinese people's respect for the Communist Party. = Post-Tiananmen protest = Chinese sensitivities to the idea of a Peaceful Evolution strategy by foreign powers were heightened by the post-Tiananmen crackdown climate of 1989, and the series of regime collapses in Eastern Europe later that year. Initially, Chinese communist leaders deemed the regime changes in the European countries as an \\"internal affair.\\" In their own meetings, however, they declared them a matter of foreign subversion, also known as peaceful evolution. Wang Zhen sought to arm Chinese troops with the ideological shield to guard against Western idea‚Äîwhile on a military inspection tour of Xinjiang he said \\"unswervingly follow the socialist road... the road may be winding and the struggle fierce... In our opposition to peaceful evolution, a key tenet is to fortify the brains of the entire party with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.\\" Jiang Zemin, the Party leader after June 4, said that peaceful evolution posed a \\"major danger\\" for communist countries. A three-part article was published in the People's Daily after the massacre titled \\"On Peaceful Evolution.\\" It argued that the collapse of communist regimes in Europe were a result of \\"bourgeois liberalization,\\" which refers to Peaceful Evolution, and that the democracy protests in China had also been an attempt to \\"negate party leadership by political pluralism, and negate public ownership in the economy by privatization.\\" The CPC's crackdown was able to \\"crush the peaceful evolution strategy of the imperialists,\\" according to scholar Jialin Zhang.  Perceptions in China  Among state-affiliated intellectuals and strategists in the PRC, the term and theory of Peaceful Evolution is a threat and an attempt to undermine the Communist Party's rule. The hard line scholar Huo Shiliang of the Chinese Academy of Social Science's says that after Dulles, the Americans' policy of attempting to peaceful transform China has simply accelerated: > Before June 4 China considered the United States as a trustworthy and > friendly country, but since June 4 the United States has become the main > source of instability in China. Peaceful evolution is the main threat to > China's stability today. The ideological struggle will be the most important > factor in future Sino-American relations. The U.S. will again become the > major threat to China, but not a military one. The Taiwan problem will > remain important. but the ideological struggle‚Äîparticularly peaceful > evolution‚Äîwill be primary. The theory of Peaceful Evolution is a key part of Chinese official assessments of the collapse of the Soviet Union. In bracing themselves against the Americans' \\"soft power\\" approaches, and attempts to undermine the regime, they have advocated a series of countermeasures. According to Li Jingjie, the director of the former Soviet-Eastern Europe Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, there are eight lessons that China must draw from the Soviet collapse, due in part to the infiltration of Peaceful Evolution: * Concentrate on growth * Be ideologically flexible * Learn from capitalist countries * Maximize the \\"comprehensive power\\" of the state, but lift living standards also * Expand inner-Party democracy, struggle against corruption * Treat intellectuals fairly * Comprehend the complexity and causes of ethnic problems * Carry out economic reforms, and include some political reforms References External links * China Heritage Quarterly: 1959: Preventing Peaceful Evolution * People's Daily editorial: Peaceful Coexistence ‚Äî Two Diametrically Opposed Policies Category:Peace Category:Foreign relations of China Category:International relations theory Category:History of the People's Republic of China ","title":"Peaceful Evolution theory"},{"id":"43003558","text":"Grevillea refracta, commonly known as the silver-leaf grevillea, is a species of plant in the protea family that is native to northern Australia.

He held the post of Shaykh at-Tafsir at Darul Uloom Deoband in India and later migrated to Pakistan where he served as Shaykh al-Hadith wat-Tafsir at Jamia Ashrafia Lahore. Notable among his written works are Ma'ariful Qur'an, a tafsir of the Qur'an, Siratul Mustafa, a sirah (biography) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and at-Ta'liq as-Sabih, an Arabic sharh (commentary) on the hadith collection Mishkat al-Masabih. A graduate of both Mazahir Uloom Saharanpur and Darul Uloom Deoband, he studied under scholars including Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri, Anwar Shah Kashmiri, and Shabbir Ahmad Usmani.Sadat, Saleem. In Name and introduction In the introduction to one of his works, he introduces himself as \\"Hafiz Muhammad Idris ibn Maulana Hafiz Muhammad Ismail Kandhlawi, Siddiqi by nasab (lineage), Hanafi by madhhab (school of jurisprudence), and Chishti by mashrab (spiritual disposition, lit. 'spring').\\" Elsewhere, in one of his Arabic works, he writes, \\"as-Siddiqi al-Faruqi by nasab, al-Bawfali by birth and origin, al- Kandahlawi by home, al-Hanafi by madhhab, an-Naqshbandi, al-Mujaddidi.\\" He was Siddiqi on his father's side, tracing his ancestry to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, In while on his mother's side he was Faruqi, claiming descent from Umar al-Faruq. Thus he referred to himself as both Siddiqi and Faruqi. He adhered to the Hanafi school of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and his tariqah (order) in Sufism was the Chishtiyah Sabiriyah, which incorporates several orders, including the Naqshbandiyah Mujaddidiyah. He was born in Bhopal and so he was \\"al-Bawfali\\" (Urdu: Bhopali). However he is commonly known by the nisbat \\"Kandhlawi\\", referring to his home, Kandhla, a north-Indian town known for producing many Islamic scholars. A descendant of Mufti Ilahi Bakhsh Kandhlawi, his nasab (patronymic) is as follows: Mu·∏•ammad Idrƒ´s ibn Mu·∏•ammad IsmƒÅ‚Äòƒ´l ibn Mu·∏•ammad Is·∏•ƒÅq ibn Mu·∏•ammad Abul-QƒÅsim ibn IlƒÅhƒ´ BakÕühsh. Birth and early life Idris was born on 12 Rabi ath-Thani 1317 AH ( 20 August 1899), the son of Maulana Muhammad Ismail Kandhlawi (d. 1942), in Bhopal, capital of the princely Bhopal State. Ismail, an Islamic scholar and a disciple of Haji Imdadullah Muhajir Makki, worked in Bhopal in the State's Forest Department. When Idris was a few years old, Ismail resigned from his post and began teaching hadith in the Jami Masjid in Kandhla. Idris grew up in a religious household. It was common for even the women in the family to know the Qur'an by heart. As per the family tradition, Idris memorized the Qur'an, completing it with his father at the age of nine in Kandhla. Education After Idris completed hifz (memorization) of the Qur'an, his father entrusted him to Ashraf Ali Thanawi for religious education at Khanqah Imdadiyah Ashrafiyah in Thana Bhawan. At the madrasah there he completed his primary education in the Dars-i Nizami curriculum with Thanawi as well as with Maulana Abdullah Gangohi. Then, as Madrasah Ashrafiyah only had arrangements for the primary curriculum, Idris was admitted to Mazahir Uloom Saharanpur for further training in the Islamic sciences. Thanawi himself took Idris to Saharanpur and presented him to Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri. At Mazahir Uloom his teachers included Maulana Saharanpuri, Maulana Sabit Ali, Maulana Abdul Latif, and Maulana Zafar Ahmad Usmani. After completing dawrah of hadith he received his sanad-i faraghat (certificate of completion) at the age of 19. Thereafter, Idris completed dawrah of hadith a second time at Darul Uloom Deoband, with scholars including Allamah Anwar Shah Kashmiri, Allamah Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, Mufti Azizur Rahman Usmani, Maulana Muhammad Ahmad Nanautawi, Maulana Habibur Rahman Usmani, and Sayyid Asghar Husain Deobandi. At Deoband his fellow students included Mufti Muhammad Shafi and Qari Muhammad Tayyib. Career Idris spent the majority of his life in the service of institutions of Islamic learning. His career can be summarized as follows: * 1921‚Äì1922: Madrasah Aminiyah Delhi * 1922‚Äì1929: Darul Uloom Deoband * 1929‚Äì1939: Hyderabad State * 1939‚Äì1949: Darul Uloom Deoband in the post of Shaykh at-Tafsir * 1949‚Äì1951: Jamiah Abbasiyah Bahawalpur in the post of Shaykh al-Jamiah * 1951‚Äì1974: Jamia Ashrafia Lahore in the post of Shaykh al-Hadith wat-Tafsir =Madrasah Aminiyah= Upon completing his education, in 1921 / 1338 AH Maulana Idris was appointed to his first teaching post at Madrasah Aminiyah, Delhi. This was during the time of Mufti Kifayatullah Dihlawi's leadership at the madrasah. However, after only one year, Maulana Muhammad Ahmad Nanautawi, muhtamim (vice-chancellor) of Darul Uloom Deoband, and Maulana Habibur Rahman Usmani, na'ib muhtamim, (pro-vice-chancellor), invited Maulana Idris to teach at the Darul Uloom. =First stint at Darul Uloom Deoband= Idris began teaching at Darul Uloom Deoband in 1922. He was never assigned the elementary books; instead, the books initially assigned to him were Hidayah awwalin in Hanafi fiqh and Maqamat-i Hariri in Arabic literature. Later Idris was assigned to teach the hadith collection Mishkat al-Masabih. Tafsir al-Jalalayn was also his responsibility. Idris remained with the Darul Uloom for nine years. During this time he regularly delivered a lecture on the Qur'an after Fajr prayer in the madrasah's Naudarah building. Attended by both intermediate and advanced students, in these lessons difficult issues in tafsir, hadith, ilm al-kalam, and fiqh were discussed. =Hyderabad State= In 1929, due to disagreements with the Darul Uloom's leadership, Anwar Shah Kashmiri and Shabbir Ahmad Usmani left the madrasah followed by other teachers and students. Idris left Deoband, taking up a post in Hyderabad State, where he remained for approximately nine years. There, in addition to teaching, he engaged in the writing and compilation of various works, including at-Ta'liq as-sabih, an Arabic commentary on Mishkat al-Masabih in several volumes. He had access to the Asafiyah Library, where he made use of books including a rare manuscript of at-Turbashti's sharh (commentary) of Masabih as-Sunnah, said to be the only such manuscript in India at the time. Though much of his time in Hyderabad was spent in research and authorship he did continue to teach; he taught the hadith collection Mishkat al-masabih in its entirety several times. In Hyderabad State Idris had the opportunity to meet Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall. The two lived across from each other for some time and would often engage in conversation regarding Islam. Other friends and contacts included Manazir Ahsan Gilani and Abdul Bari Nadwi, in whose gatherings many learned individuals would congregate. During his stay Idris also met Abul Ala Maududi and his brother Abul Khair Maududi, both with whom he remained in contact with until the end of his life. =Second stint at Darul Uloom Deoband= In 1936 and 1937 Idris was twice invited to take up a post at Madrasah Islamiyah Arabiyah in Dabhel, where Kashmiri and Usmani had shifted, but he refused both offers. However, in 1939 he was invited to take the post of Shaykh at-Tafsir at Darul Uloom Deoband by Usmani, who by then had returned to the Darul Uloom as sadr muhtamim (chancellor), and Qari Muhammad Tayyib, who was then muhtamim. Idris accepted, although the salary was less than half of what he was receiving in Hyderabad. Thus in 1939 Idris returned to Darul Uloom Deoband as Shaykh at-Tafsir and remained there until 1949. In addition to teaching Tafsir Ibn Kathir and Tafsir al-Baydawi, the main books of the dawrah tafsir curriculum, he also taught Tafsir al-Jalalayn, Sunan Abu Dawud, and Tahawi. He also continued to conduct his regular Qur'an lecture. =Jamiah Abbasiyah Bahawalpur= After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, who had migrated to Pakistan before independence, repeatedly called Idris to come to Pakistan. Idris finally decided to leave India in 1949, due to what he perceived as the worsening of conditions for Islam and Muslims in the country. In May 1949 he resigned from Darul Uloom Deoband and returned home to Kandhla. He received invitations from other institutions in India, which he refused. He was invited to take the post of Shaykh al-Hadith at Darul Uloom Hathazari in Chittagong, East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). Despite the high salary, he also refused this offer since he wished to migrate to West Pakistan. In October 1949 Idris was invited to Jamia Abbasia in Bahawalpur, West Pakistan. Jamia Abbasia was an old university in the princely Bahawalpur State whose educational and administrative system was in need of reform. The State's Ministry of Education had requested Shabbir Ahmad Usmani in the capacity of chancellor (ra æƒ´s al-jƒÅmi øah) and Idris as vice-chancellor (shaykh al-jƒÅmi øah). Idris assumed this post on 25 December. Apart from administrative responsibilities he taught Sahih al-Bukhari and Tafsir al-Baydawi. Usmani, however, fell ill shortly after arriving in Bahawalpur and died there in December 1949. =Jamiah Ashrafiyah Lahore= In August 1951 Idris resigned from Jamia Abbasia and went to the recently established Jamia Ashrafia Lahore at the request of Mufti Mahmud Hasan, the madrasah's founder and muhtamim. At Jamia Ashrafia he served as Shaykh al-Hadith wa-at-Tafsir and taught Sahih al- Bukhari, Jami at-Tirmidhi, and Tafsir al-Baydawi. He remained with the Jamia until the end of his life. He died in Lahore on the morning of 7 Rajab 1394 / 28 July 1974, and is buried there.

It was the first play written by Field, who was aged around 22 at the time and for nearly a decade previously had been the star player of the company of boy actors.Peery p.37Munro p.178 Though the title of the play might suggest the misogyny that was popular as a theatrical topic at the time, in fact the main female characters are found to be innocent of the accusation of inconstancy, and the play attacks the iniquity of arranged marriages. A happy ending is brought about against the will of the central characters' father ‚Äì and Field portrays most of the male characters in a far worse light than the women.Southern p.93Peery p.43 Synopsis The action of the play takes place over the course of one day when a double wedding is being held in \\"the Neighbourhood of London\\". Scudmore is in love with Sir John Worldly's eldest daughter Bellafront but, as he is reading a love letter from her, his friend Nevill arrives to tell him Sir John has arranged for Bellafront to be married to rich Count Frederick that very day. Frederick's friend, Captain Powts, hoped to marry Sir John's second daughter Kate, but she is going to be wed to the rich young merchant Strange ‚Äì Sir John favours him because of his wealth. Sir John's third daughter Lucida is in love with Count Frederick and vows she will marry no one else. The newly knighted and foolish Sir Abraham Ninny ‚Äì son of Sir Innocent Ninny and his constantly-inebriated wife Lady Ninny ‚Äì tries to win Lucida's love through terrible poetry ... and fails. Nevill disguises himself as a parson ‚Äì unbeknown to anyone except the audience ‚Äì to perform the double wedding of Bellafront to Count Frederick and Kate to Strange, thereby nullifying the marriages, and giving his friend Scudmore time still to win Bellafront. After the \\"weddings\\", the angry Captain Powts arrives and tells everyone he has slept with Kate \\"often\\". Kate demands that Strange rescues her honour by killing Powts and is furious when Strange refuses ‚Äì he says it's not blood that's required; it's her \\"good name\\" that must be redeemed. Later in the day Strange, disguised as a soldier, takes a letter to Captain Powts that tells him Strange has been killed at Kate's command and she is waiting for her Captain Powts to return. The Captain is fooled by this and says he regrets lying about her. On hearing confirmation that Kate has been slandered, the disguised Strange challenges Powts to a duel. He helps the injured Powts away after the fight. Meanwhile, Lady Ninny's \\"gentlewoman\\" Mistress Wagtail, who is pregnant, has been seeking a husband. She tries to woo Count Frederick's obsequious assistant Pendant ‚Äì much to his horror ‚Äì but he persuades her instead that Sir Abraham will be stupid enough to fall for her and accept the baby as his. At a wedding masque in the evening Scudmore, disguised as Nevill, dances with Bellafront and they run off together to be married by a real priest. Nevill appears and reveals that the two marriages earlier in the day were shams. The wounded Powts is carried in by Strange and admits he had lied about sleeping with Kate. Kate is relieved she is not married, and Nevill offers her his hand, saying: \\"Mistress Kate, I kept you for myself\\". Count Frederick says \\"I have so ruminated on a wife that I must have one this night\\" ‚Äì and proposes marriage to Lucida, who loved him all along. And the gulled Sir Abraham gets his parents' approval to marry the pregnant Mistress Wagtail. First performances and publication The Children of the Queen's Revels moved from their home at Blackfriars to the nearby Whitefriars when the London theatres reopened in winter 1609-10 after a long period of closure because of the plague.Munro p.23 A Woman Is A Weathercock was one of the first plays the company performed at Whitefriars, most probably in December 1609 before being presented at Court over Christmas 1609-10, one of five plays the boys performed before the King and Prince Henry at Whitehall.Peery p.57-58 Field himself is believed to have played the role of Nevill, the \\"puppet-master\\" of the play, in these performances.Southern P.101 Though there are no contemporary records of the play's original reception, the fact that it was selected for Court performance alongside works by established playwrights suggests it must have been a success.Peery p.59 The play was published in quarto in 1612 with the title page reading: \\"A Woman is a Weather-cocke. A New Comedy, As it was acted before the King in White-hall. And divers times Privately at the White-friars, By the Children of her Majesty's Revels\\". The printed edition included a commendatory verse by the dramatist George Chapman, headed \\"To his Loved son, Nat. Field, and his Weather-cocke Woman\\". Field had performed in many of Chapman's plays including Bussy D'Ambois, All Fools, The Gentleman Usher, May Day, Monsieur D'Olive, Sir Giles Goosecap, The Widow's Tears and Eastward Ho! Peery p.14 The printed quarto begins with an address by Field \\"To any Woman that hath beene no Weathercocke\\" in which he says that any woman who has been \\"constant\\" will see \\"what amendes I have made to her and all her sex\\" when \\"my next Play be printed\\". Field's second play Amends to Ladies ‚Äì his only other solo creation ‚Äì had already been staged by the time A Woman is a Weathercock was printed, probably by October 1611.Peery p.16 Critical and performance history A Woman is a Weathercock was among the Jacobean plays revived by the Duke's Company at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1667 when the London theatres reopened 18 years after their closure at the start of the English Civil War. There are few records of professional performances since, though several editions of the play have been published, first by John Payne Collier in 1829. An edition based on a copy of the first quarto in the Folger Shakespeare Library was published in 1950, edited by William Peery. Commentators like Peery have called A Woman is a Weathercock a remarkable achievement for a first-time dramatist who was not yet 22 ‚Äì and ascribed this to the practical experience Field had amassed performing on the stage since the age of 11 or 12.Peery p.37 Collier said: \\"A Woman is a Weathercock and its sequel Amends for Ladies are the productions of no ordinary poet: in comic scenes Field excels Massinger ... and in those of a serious character he may be frequently placed on a footing of equality.\\" Collier, 3 Excerpt from a review of A Woman Is a Weathercock in The Times, 28 April 1914 R.F. Brinkley said Field knew instinctively how to cater to the taste of the audiences at the indoor theatres with a satire that featured much music, a masque, rowdy scenes, bawdiness, and quick-witted comic repartee ‚Äì the type of play he had taken part in so many times as a boy actor.Brinkley p.38 In 1914 the play was revived by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in a production by Patrick Kirwan with Basil Sydney playing the role of Nevill, Stanley Howlitt as Scudmore and Lydia Hayward as Bellafront.Shakespeare Birthplace Trust Archive Catalogue; press night record from 27 April 1914, retrieved 9 June 2014. \\"Archive record\\" A review in The Times on 28 April 1914 said the most effective scenes \\"were those in which the comedians ‚Äì Pendant, the Ninny family, and the others ‚Äì figured prominently\\". It noted that the role of Mistress Wagtail \\"was considered too Elizabethan altogether and had been bodily removed from the cast, but Mr Harry Gribble as Sir Abraham Ninny, who ought to have married her, found his way into his audience's heart\\". The review ends by saying: \\"The whole production was a piece of work well worth seeing.\\" The Times, Tuesday 28 April 1914, P.10 In 1992 a production of A Woman is a Weathercock was staged by professional theatre company Trampoline at the Pentameters Theatre in Hampstead, London, from 18 February to 15 March. Jeremy Kingston, reviewing the play for The Times, said it was clear Field \\"knew how to shape a drama and weave three or four plots in a whole\\". Suzi Feay, writing in Time Out, said \\"It is an enthralling portrait of a society both savage and tender, a poke in the eye to the pompous and well-to-do, and a vindication of love\\", and Irving Wardle, writing in the Independent on Sunday, said the play was \\"more than a collector's piece\\" and led \\"into unexpected and human directions, entirely belying the author's misogynistic reputation\\".Williams p.386-391 In 2013 A Woman is a Weathercock was performed by an all-boys company from Pocklington School at the Merchant Adventurers' Hall, York, on 27 and 28 November in a production described as the first staged since the 17th century \\"in the style of the original players, with a cast the same age as the originals, with the actors making lots of decisions, with the audience on three sides, with live music and song and without special lighting or any technology\\".York Press, 21 November 2013, retrieved 8 June 2014 \\"Pocklington School performs A Woman Is A Weathercock\\" Notes References * Brinkley, Roberta Florence.

Roman Robak (April 4, 1881 in Dƒôbica - October 6, 1977 in Toronto) was one of only two Holocaust survivors of the Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp who testified about his experience after the war. He submitted a deposition to the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in January 1946 in Krak√≥w. In terms of the number of Polish Jews who perished in its gas chambers, Be≈Ç≈ºec had the third highest death toll among the six Nazi death camps located in occupied Poland, estimated between 500,000 and 600,000 men, women and children. Only Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka had more victims. The postwar testimony of Reder was of special significance, because Chaim Hirszman who also survived Be≈Ç≈ºec, joined the new communist militia in Stalinist Poland tasked with the crushing of Polish underground, torture, makeshift executions, and mass deportation to Siberia of over 50,000 political undesirables.Poland's holocaust By Tadeusz Piotrowski. Page 131. . Hirszman was shot in March 1946 at his residence by the Cursed soldiers from TOW, in the course of an anti-communist insurrection against the new regime, before he was able to give a full account of his camp experience. Life Reder ran his own soap factory in Lemberg (then in the Austrian Partition) until 1910, according to the Be≈Ç≈ºec Museum website. He married Feiga (n√©e) Felsenfeld. They had two children, daughter Freida (Zofia) born in 1908 (or 1916) and a son Boruch (Bronis≈Çaw), in 1907. Historian Dariusz Libionka informs that until 1919 Reder was in the United States. He returned to Lw√≥w in already sovereign Poland and resumed (or perhaps, only began) soap production with the newly acquired knowledge. During the Holocaust, he lost his (then) first wife and both children. Reder, age 61, was deported to Be≈Ç≈ºec on August 11, 1942, with one of the first transports of Jews from the Lw√≥w Ghetto after the new big gas chambers were erected of brick and mortar. Because of his good knowledge of German he was not sent off to die, but assigned to the Sonderkommando with a handful of others. At the ramp he claimed to have been a machinist, and for the next three months performed maintenance on engine for the gas chambers among other tasks. At the end of November 1942, during the prisoner transport to Lviv for camp supplies and sheet metal, he escaped under cover of darkness. A Ukrainian woman, his former employee, helped him first, as did the Polish Righteous Joanna Borkowska whom Rudolf Reder married after the war and later emigrated with, settling in Toronto, Canada. He and his second wife, Joanna, are buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, in Toronto. It was previously believed, by all accounts, that he had died in 1968. This has proven to be false. =Reder's book= Soon after the Soviet takeover, whilst still in Poland, Reder testified in January 1946 in Krak√≥w before the Central Commission for Investigation of German Crimes (known as the Institute of National Remembrance at present). In the same year, he published his testimony in a book, with the help of the Jewish Historical Committee in Krak√≥w. His monograph titled Be≈Ç≈ºec was written in Polish with the Preface by his editor, Nella Rost, and illustrated with a map by J√≥zef Bau, a Holocaust survivor who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts. In the book, Reder wrote about what he saw as the motor- maintenance worker, and what he learned afterwards: Reder changed his name to Roman Robak in 1949 and left Poland for Israel in 1950. He emigrated with his second wife to Canada in 1953. In 1960 he submitted a deposition at the prosecutor‚Äôs office in Munich as part of the German preparations for the Belzec trial against eight former SS members of Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp personnel.

The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is developed and maintained by Anaconda, Inc., which was founded by Peter Wang and Travis Oliphant in 2012. As an Anaconda, Inc. product, it is also known as Anaconda Distribution or Anaconda Individual Edition, while other products from the company are Anaconda Team Edition and Anaconda Enterprise Edition, both of which are not free. Package versions in Anaconda are managed by the package management system conda. This package manager was spun out as a separate open- source package as it ended up being useful on its own and for other things than Python. There is also a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda called Miniconda, which includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other packages.  Overview  Anaconda distribution comes with over 250 packages automatically installed, and over 7,500 additional open-source packages can be installed from PyPI as well as the conda package and virtual environment manager. It also includes a GUI, Anaconda Navigator, as a graphical alternative to the command line interface (CLI). The big difference between conda and the pip package manager is in how package dependencies are managed, which is a significant challenge for Python data science and the reason conda exists. When pip installs a package, it automatically installs any dependent Python packages without checking if these conflict with previously installed packages. It will install a package and any of its dependencies regardless of the state of the existing installation. Because of this, a user with a working installation of, for example, Google Tensorflow, can find that it stops working having used pip to install a different package that requires a different version of the dependent numpy library than the one used by Tensorflow. In some cases, the package may appear to work but produce different results in detail. In contrast, conda analyses the current environment including everything currently installed, and, together with any version limitations specified (e.g. the user may wish to have Tensorflow version 2,0 or higher), works out how to install a compatible set of dependencies, and shows a warning if this cannot be done. Open source packages can be individually installed from the Anaconda repository, Anaconda Cloud (anaconda.org), or the user's own private repository or mirror, using the \`conda install\` command. Anaconda, Inc. compiles and builds the packages available in the Anaconda repository itself, and provides binaries for Windows 32/64 bit, Linux 64 bit and MacOS 64-bit. Anything available on PyPI may be installed into a conda environment using pip, and conda will keep track of what it has installed itself and what pip has installed. Custom packages can be made using the \`conda build\` command, and can be shared with others by uploading them to Anaconda Cloud, PyPI or other repositories. The default installation of Anaconda2 includes Python 2.7 and Anaconda3 includes Python 3.7. However, it is possible to create new environments that include any version of Python packaged with conda. = Anaconda Navigator = Anaconda Navigator Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) included in Anaconda distribution that allows users to launch applications and manage conda packages, environments and channels without using command-line commands. Navigator can search for packages on Anaconda Cloud or in a local Anaconda Repository, install them in an environment, run the packages and update them. It is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. The following applications are available by default in Navigator: * JupyterLab * Jupyter Notebook * QtConsole * Spyder * Glue * Orange * RStudio * Visual Studio Code = Conda = Conda is an open source, cross-platform, language-agnostic package manager and environment management system that installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language (e.g., R), including multi-language projects. The conda package and environment manager is included in all versions of Anaconda, Miniconda, and Anaconda Repository.  Anaconda Cloud  Anaconda Cloud is a package management service by Anaconda where users can find, access, store and share public and private notebooks, environments, and conda and PyPI packages. Cloud hosts useful Python packages, notebooks and environments for a wide variety of applications. Users do not need to log in or to have a Cloud account, to search for public packages, download and install them. Users can build new packages using the Anaconda Client command line interface (CLI), then manually or automatically upload the packages to Cloud.

Career  'Umar was a supporter of the Abbasid Revolution and fought during the Siege of Wasit. Following the Abbasid victory against the Umayyads, he was appointed to a number of governorships. Under Abu al-'Abbas he was governor of al-Basrah until 750 and was subsequently appointed to al-Bahrayn. Following the ascension of al-Mansur, he was appointed twice more to al-Basrah, from 755 to 757 and from 759 to 760. In 760 'Umar was appointed to al-Sind, which was under the control of 'Uyaynah ibn Musa al-Tamimi. When the latter refused to relinquish his authority, 'Umar attacked him and besieged him for eleven months, until 'Uyaynah agreed to depart from the region and return to al- Mansur. While in al-Sind, 'Umar secretly sided with the movement of Muhammad the Pure Soul and gave assistance to Muhammad's son 'Abdallah when the latter arrived in the region; when al-Mansur became aware of this, he managed to avoid punishment after a member of his household volunteered to take the blame in his place. In 768, following the killing of al-Aghlab ibn Salim at-Tamimi, the governor of Ifriqiya, 'Umar was dismissed from Sind and appointed to that province instead. Arriving in al-Qayrawan with five hundred horsemen, he won over the city leaders by acting generously toward them, and the first three years of his governorship were peaceful.  Kharijite rebellion and death  After receiving orders from al-Mansur, 'Umar went to Tubna in order to strengthen its defenses, and left Habib ibn Habib al-Muhallabi as his deputy in al-Qayrawan. While he was at Tubna, however, the Berbers rose in rebellion, and Habib was killed while attempting to suppress them. Encouraged by their success, the Berbers gathered around Tripoli and placed themselves under the leadership of the Ibadi Abu Hatim Ya'qub ibn Habib al-Ibadi. When the governor of Tripoli requested assistance, 'Umar dispatched an army against the rebels, but Abu Hatim defeated it and forced it to withdraw to Qabis. At this point, the rebellion spread throughout the entire province, and a large Kharijite coalition headed by the Sufri Abu Qurra al-Ifrani, 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam, Abu Hatim, 'Asim al-Sidrati al-Ibadi and others advanced upon Tubna and placed it under siege. Despite being badly outnumbered by the rebels, 'Umar was able to extricate himself from the situation by bribing Abu Qurra's men to go home and defeating Ibn Rustam in battle. The remaining Kharijite forces under Abu Hatim decided to abandon Tubna and departed for al-Qayrawan, which they surrounded and besieged for eight months. 'Umar initially remained in Tubna, which he fortified in anticipation of a future attack. News eventually reached him, however, that al-Qayrawan was running critically low on supplies, so he left a garrison in Tubna and advanced against the rebels. The Berbers responded by attacking him en route and forcing him to temporarily withdraw to Tunis, but he was eventually able to make his way into al-Qayrawan, bringing with him food, mounts and other provisions. Following 'Umar's arrival in al- Qayrawan, Abu Hatim returned to set up a new siege of the city, and fighting between the two sides recommenced. As the siege wore on, the situation in the city quickly worsened; food again became scarce and the defenders were forced to eat their animals. 'Umar himself decided to lead a sortie against the rebels, but he was defeated and killed. Following his death, the surviving defenders struck an agreement with Abu Hatim and withdrew to Tubna, allowing the Berbers to storm al-Qawrawan and enter it.

Vicko Krstuloviƒá (27 April 1905 ‚Äì 28 September 1988) was a Yugoslav communist revolutionary, the most prominent Partisan military commander from Dalmatia during World War II, and a post-war communist politician. He was an illegal communist activist during the 1920s and 1930s in Split at a time when communist sympathizers were brutally persecuted by the Yugoslav monarchy. As an officer in the Partisans during World War II, he was in charge of creating and organising the resistance movement in Dalmatia. In Socialist Yugoslavia, he worked in various government offices and was remembered for his work and contribution to his native Split. Early years (1905‚Äì1918) Vicko Krstuloviƒá was born on 27 April 1905 in Split during the former Austria-Hungary empire. He was born to a labour family. His father worked in the Split fields as an agriculturist. Vicko was introduced in politics thanks to his father who was a social democrat. His father was the first person to carry the red flag during the Labour Day parade in Split. When his father was mobilised for World War I, Vicko was forced to carry on his work in the fields. His father returned from the war with an illness which prevented him from doing hard work. At that time, Vicko would hide people in his fields that escaped mobilisation for the war. Vicko like most Split residents supported the Kingdom of Serbia and was a fierce opponent of the Austria-Hungary empire which ruled Dalmatia with repression. Communist revolutionary =Illegal political activism (1919‚Äì1937)= After the war, Vicko expected much from the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes but it proved to be a disaster. In 1919, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was founded and Vicko was attracted by its ideas. In 1920, after the Communists won a large number of the city's in the local elections, the government banned them from acting legally and they became a forbidden party.http://www.ljevak.hr/knjige/knjiga-13220/ At that time in 1920, Vicko became a member of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia. He worked as an illegal and was obligated to spread forbidden communist material around the city (mostly books). In 1922, he officially joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. He became a member of the Dalmatian communist committee where he helped organise secret meetings, welcome foreign communist activists to the city and hide them. He also helped in organising Trade unions. In the 1930s, his house was under raid by the police and he was arrested for dispatching illegal material. He was tortured and sentenced to prison. During that time, his mother died from illness after which he swore on her grave that he will avenge her. =Secretary of the Provincial committee of Communist party of Croatia for Dalmatia (1938‚Äì1941)= During the 1930s, the head of the Dalmatian communists was called Jelaska. He used the communists party in the city for his own pleasure and was neglecting the organisation. Vicko argued that he didn't expand the activity to the Dalmatia hinterlands which would prove devastating in later years. In 1937, Vicko attended a meeting in Zagreb where the League of Communists of Croatia was established. In 1939, Vicko was made the secretary of the Dalmatian communists. At the time, he was working at the Split shipyard. Vicko began organising the party and expanding it. He welcomed high-ranking members of the party such as Josip Broz Tito, Edvard Kardelj and Rade Konƒçar. He organised labour strikes in Split and managed to strengthen the party. In 1940, Vicko attended the 5th state conference of the Communist party of Yugoslavia where the defence of Yugoslavia's independence and the mobilisation of the masses in the struggle to solve the internal social and national problems was discussed. Vicko was one of the organisers for the 1941 Tripartite Pact protests in Split. When the Invasion of Yugoslavia began, Vicko urged party members to join the army and fight against the fascist and collaborators. When it was clear that Yugoslavia was losing, the party members were told to hide as many weapons as possible for the upcoming armed guerilla resistance. World War II =Organising the first partisan detachments (1941)= After Yugoslavia lost the war, the Dalmatian coast along with Split was occupied by the Italian army. On 10 April 1941, the German puppet state and Italian protectorate called Independent State of Croatia (NDH) was established in Zagreb. Soon after, Vicko Krstuloviƒá went to Zagreb for a meeting where the communist party planned an armed resistance. Since Vicko was the Dalmatian committee secretary, he was obligated to prepare and lead the resistance in Dalmatia. He was given only a few months to prepare. Vicko expressed his concerns. He believed that it was impossible to prepare in such a low amount of time but he was forced to do so. In August 1941, a few partisan detachments were sent from Dalmatian city's with the most notable one being the 1st Split Partisan Detachment which was made of 44 fighters. They went from Split to the Dalmatian hinterlands. Their goal was to reach the Dinara mountains and connect with the resistance movement in Bosnia. The detachment was quickly spotted by the Usta≈°e militia and Italian army and engaged in combat. After a few hours of fighting, they were outnumbered by the Italian and Usta≈°e forces and were forced to surrender. 25 fighters were captured and 13 fighters escaped back to Split. The 24 partisan prisoners were sentenced to death by NDH court in Sinj and executed by the Italians and Ustashe on 26 August 1941 at Rudu≈°a near Sinj.http://www.ratnakronikasplita.com/prilozi/prvi-splitski-partizanski- odred/ The rest of the partisan detachments that went from Dalmatia also failed. Most of them were forced to retreat from the hinterlands. Vicko Krstuloviƒá later received a letter from the Central committee for Communist party of Croatia where he was blamed for the failure of those actions but he replied that it was their fault. The Central committee for Communist party of Croatia sent Rade Konƒçar to help Krstuloviƒá organise another attempt of reaching the Dinara mountains. =Commander of the Dalmatian partisan units (1941‚Äì1943)= The staff of the 4th operational zone in September 1942. Krstuloviƒá is the second from the left.In November 1941, Vicko managed to reach the Dinara mountains and he became the commander of the Dinara partisan detachment. That meant that all of the partisan units in Dalmatia were gradually coming under his command.http://www.ratnakronikasplita.com/prilozi/portreti/ The partisans in Dalmatia fought mostly against the Italian army, Usta≈°e militia, Croatian Home Guard and the Chetniks. They used guerrilla warfare. At first, they would use road ambushes against enemy vehicles and steal as many weapons and ammo as possible. They also attacked Usta≈°e guard posts in small villages. In 1942, the area around Muƒá was the first major liberated territory in Dalmatia. Vicko Krstuloviƒá became the commander of the 4th operational zone of Supreme HQ of Croatia in April 1942. The 4th zone was the entire territory of Dalmatia west from river Neretva. He also started creating national liberation committees in various liberated villages. They were created for the purpose of installing the new partisan government. He also worked hard on ensuring the arrival of new partisan recruits from the coastal areas and islands of Dalmatia. Vicko also helped the local resistance movement in Herzegovina called Starac Vujadin. They were Serb fighters who were under the threat of the Usta≈°e militia and Home guard. Vicko knew there was a danger of them joining the Chetniks so he tried to keep them with the partisans. Vicko knew the importance Serbian settlers in Dalmatia at that time because they made more than half of the Dalmatian partisans. The Serbs were under the constant threat from the Usta≈°e government and the Italians knew that so they would send them to Split as refugees and then they would be mobilised in the Chetniks who were allies with the Italian army. Vicko helped organise the partisan resistance in Bukovica which was near the Chetnik-Italian controlled area of Kninska Krajina. In July 1942, Vicko went to the mountain Cincar to attend a meeting with the Supreme HQ of the National liberation army of Yugoslavia and the commander in chief, Josip Broz Tito. Vicko was given orders to create partisan brigades for the upcoming actions. In August 1942, he joined the liberation of Livno in Bosnia. There he created a Dalmatian liberation committee which would ensure better connections with the other committee branches in Dalmatia. By the end of 1942 and beginning of 1943, there were 5 new brigades created in Dalmatia. On 13 February 1943 in Imotski, the 3rd, 4th and 5th Dalmatian brigade merged into the 9th Dalmatian Division under the leadership of Vicko Krstuloviƒá. =Battle for the Wounded (February‚ÄìApril 1943)= In the beginning of 1943, the Germans launched the Fourth Enemy Offensive. Their goal was to surround and destroy the partisan forces in western Bosnia and in other parts of Independent State of Croatia. Josip Broz Tito along with the Supreme HQ decided to evacuate the entire area and cross the Neretva river. They were meant to reach Montenegro.http://www.lupiga.com/vijesti/kultura-sjecanja- partizani-su-podigli-most-za-19-sati-a-nadleznim-organima-u-bih-to-nije- uspjelo-ni-za-19-godina/ Vicko Krstuloviƒá and the 9th Dalmatian division were given a hard task to protect the flanks facing Jablanica and Neretva from the difficult and craggy terrain of Imotski and Biokovo. The division faced heavy attacks from the Germans, Italians, Ustashe and Chetniks. The enemy used heavy aviation, tanks and artillery which gradually forced all 3 partisan brigades to slowly retreat to the right shore of the Neretva river. While the 9th division was under critical pressure from the enemy and forced to stay in the hills above Neretva, they were still obligated by the orders of Tito and the HQ to take and move the Central hospital and heavy wounded through the mountain terrain of Dinara,Bikovo, Kame≈°nica and Dalmatia. Vicko refused to accept those orders because he knew they were impossible and suicidal. After a meeting with the 9th division command, he went to see Tito in the village of Graƒçanica. He was determined that the only way to save the wounded was to cross the Neretva river on the right shore and go to Montenegro. After hours of talking, Vicko was allowed to continue his plan. He crossed the river with the 9th division and the Central hospital. They moved through the mountain range of Prenj and territory of Glavatiƒçevo to the Boraƒçko Lake. The fighters and wounded suffered from Typhoid fever, Hypothermia and Starvation. The 9th division ended their 2-month long campaign with the liberation of the town Nevesinje. On 14 April 1943, the 9th Dalmatian division was disbanded in the Kifino village due to a big number of wounded and deceased fighters. The order was given by Tito and the Supreme HQ. Vicko believed that it was a big mistake to disband the division. He thought that it was a conspiracy against the Dalmatian partisans. =Battle of the Sutjeska (May‚ÄìJune 1943)= After the 9th division was disbanded, Vicko joined the Supreme HQ and Tito. The entire Yugoslav liberation army was heading to cross the Sutjeska river. The Axis rallied 127,000 land troops and 300 aeroplanes for the Fifth Enemy Offensive. Their goal was to eliminate Tito and central partisan forces. Vicko and the Supreme HQ went through the Durmitor massive between the Tara and Piva rivers in the mountainous areas of northern Montenegro. Vicko travelled with his family and with the famous poet Vladimir Nazor. They faced heavy fog and slippery terrain in the mountains. The area was Chetnik controlled and food supply was extremely low. In the early morning, they managed to cross the Sutjeska river under heavy rain and German mortar shelling. When the weather cleared that day, German aviation started advancing. The partisans and HQ quickly advanced between Gornje and Donje Bare to the Hrƒçavka river. They were under German fire and Vicko almost lost his entire family. Tito was also wounded from an aviation bomb. The Supreme HQ managed to reach Miljevina. They settled there and were almost liquidated by a German task force but the partisans managed to react first and execute the Germans. The HQ managed to reach the Red Rocks at Romanija and Vicko at that point lost connection with them so he went to the 2nd Dalmatian brigade HQ. =Return to Dalmatia and the 1st liberation of Split (August‚ÄìSeptember 1943)= In the beginning of August 1943, Vicko was with Tito and the Supreme HQ at a party conference of the 1st Proleter brigade in Petrovo polje. Vicko was determined to go back in Dalmatia along with the 1st and 2nd Dalmatian brigade cause he knew that the Italians were collapsing after the Allied invasion of Sicily. He held a private conversation with Tito and managed to convince him of his plans. He was given only the 1st Dalmatian brigade because the 2nd brigade was going to Montenegro. After that, Tito relieved him of his commanding duty and made him responsible only for political assignments on the field. Vicko believed that he was being punished for disobeying his orders at Neretva. Vicko returned to Dalmatia on 22 August 1943 with the 1st brigade and the 4th operational zone was again established. He became the zone commander but was limited to only political work. On 3 September 1943, the Armistice of Cassibile was signed and Italy capitulated, but the Italians were still holding Split and refused to surrender to the partisan forces. After days of negotiations, the partisans finally got in contact with general Emilio Becucci. On 16 September 1943, the surrender of the Italian army was signed at the hotel Park in Split. General Koƒça Popoviƒá and Ivo Lola Ribar signed the treaty in the name of the Yugoslav army. After that, Split officially became the biggest liberated city in occupied Europe.http://www.ratnakronikasplita.com/kronika/1943-2/ Vicko entered Split along with the other high-ranking partisan officers on 10 September. On that day, Vicko and Ivo Lola Ribar started negotiating with general Becucci for the immediate handover of all weapons from the Italian army. At that time, the Sixth Enemy Offensive was under way and the German forces were gradually coming closer to occupying the Dalmatian coast which was abandoned by the Italians. The partisans started transporting weapons and ammo from the city to the hinterland before the Germans occupy the city. The 1st Proletarian Brigade and the other partisan units were holding the Klis-Sinj line against the enemy. Tito gave the order that the Germans were to be stopped from entering Split for as long as possible. The Germans were surrounded in Klis, Sinj and Dicmo but the partisan units were badly synchronised due to a lack of communication. A great number of volunteers from Split joined the partisans and they were able to cover the loss in numbers. The 1st Proletarian brigade managed to repeal the German reinforcements in Imotski but the enemy kept reinforcing even more. The partisans saw a chance of conquering the larger Split area and repealing the Germans from it. The partisan units launched an offensive on Dicmo and Sinj but they all failed. The Germans quickly started a counter-offensive and began advancing on Split. The 4th operational command gave the order to evacuate all weapons, military equipment, and personnel to Dinara. Vicko and Ivo Lola Ribar left Split and went through Ka≈°tela to Muƒá and Cetina. They made contact with the 4th Krajina division and managed to deliver the Italian equipment .On 25 September 1943, the partisans left their battle positions and on 27 September, the German forces entered Split. =Political work and the 2nd liberation of Split (1943‚Äì1944)= In October 1943, the 8th Dalmatian Corps took control of the 4th operational zone and Vicko was restricted to political work at ZAVNOH and AVNOJ. On 29 November 1943, Vicko attended the famous 2nd AVNOJ meeting in Jajce where the National Committee for the Liberation of Yugoslavia was established. It was the highest governing body of the new Yugoslav republic. Vicko was elected as a member of AVNOJ. By late 1943, Vicko was stationed on the Adriatic island of Vis which was occupied by the Comonwelth and American troops. He worked on the transport of injured soldiers and civilians to Italy and El Shatt in Egypt. He called Tito to join him on Vis where he could be safe from enemy attacks but Tito rejected the idea. In May 1944, Tito and the Supreme HQ were targets of a German airborne assault in Drvar. Tito barely escaped from the German breach and was quickly transported to Vis by the British. Vicko was present during the Treaty of Vis signing between Tito and the royal government representative, Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá.http://www.knjiga.ba/knjizevnost/memoari/vicko-krstulovic-memoari- jugoslavenskog-revolucionera-2-1943-1945-k9065.html In September 1944, the 8th Dalmatian corps began with the offensive on Dalmatia. By mid-October, they managed to reach Split and liberate most of the Dalmatia region. On 21 October, the 2nd liberation of Split was underway. The Germans used heavy artillery from Klis to slow them from the north but the Yugoslav Navy managed to offload reinforcements just east of Split. The main assault began on 25 October and the partisan troops managed to defeat the German-Ustashe war machine in a day. On the morning of 26 October 1944, fighters of the 10th brigade from the 20th partisan division entered and liberated Split for the 2nd and final time. On 27 October, Vicko Krstuloviƒá was the first to arrive in Split by boat with the famous composer Ivo Tijardoviƒá. He was greeted by a big crowd in the Split port. This marked the end of Vicko's war campaign.http://www.ratnakronikasplita.com/kronika/1944-2 Postwar political career =Political functions in Federal Yugoslavia= In December 1944, Vicko was made the commissioner for industry and trade of ZAVNOH. He stayed in Split during the first few months of liberation. In April 1945, he became the minister of internal affairs of the newly established Federal State of Croatia. He moved to Zagreb after the Ustashe government fled from it in May 1945. In January 1946, he became the minister of labour and maritime affairs in the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia. He then moved to Belgrade with his family. In April 1951, he became the president of the regional committee CP Croatia for Dalmatia and in February 1952, he became the President of the Presidium of the Croatian Parliament which was at the time the highest governing body in SR Croatia. After his term ended, he became the member of the Federal Executive Council in February 1953. From 1954 to 1958, he was the committee president in the SR Croatia parliament and a representative in the parliament from 1945 to 1963. From 1963 to 1967, he was the president of the budget committee in the Federal assembly and a representative in the assembly from 1945 to 1967. =Unrealised ideas and criticism of the state policy= Vicko Krstuloviƒá was one of the designers of the SR Croatia coat of arms. Thanks to him, the sea was put in there. He also did much for his native Split and Dalmatia. As a committee president of Dalmatia, he was sent to Split in order to stop the chaos which was being done there. He helped on creating transportation systems in Split and connecting it more with the rest of the country. Vicko represented the idea that the new railway should go from Sarajevo to Split, and not to Kardeljevo but his idea was rejected. Vicko wrote the Adriatic Orientation of Yugoslavia. It was a book about the sea potential that Yugoslavia has and how it should be used. He tried to persuade Tito on reading it but it was never seriously taken.http://www.knjiznica- krizevci.hr/ekatalog/knjiga.asp?id_broj=47934 Vicko criticised the new direction of the Communist party of Yugoslavia. He was against changing the party name in 1952 to League of Communist. He believed that the party was rejecting its revolutionary path and that it was starting to accept a bureaucratic-dogmatic way of functioning. He knew that the party was slowly becoming open to extreme careerism and it was ignoring all the old party members. The party members who were longer in the party than Tito were especially ignored and put aside. Vicko was later relieved of any important political duty after he made remarks that Tito and the other old guard officials should retire and leave the country to younger generations.http://www.abebooks.fr/Krstulovic-Vicko-Maksim-tragicni- revolucioner-umjetnik/14278174223/bd Final years Vicko spent his last years of life in his native Split. He was still active in social life and he still gave interviews to journalists. In September 1988, he was admitted to the Military hospital in Split for treatment but during a routine therapy session, the doctors used electrical equipment not knowing he had a pacemaker. On 28 September 1988, Vicko Krstuloviƒá died due to medical complications. After his death, his son Vladimir Krstuloviƒá gave all of Vicko's possessions and archives to the Historical museum in Belgrade. Private life Vicko was married to Lucija Krstuloviƒá and had 3 children: Maksim, Nata≈°a and Vladimir. His wife and 2 children, Maksim and Nata≈°a were with him during the Battle of Neretva and Sutjeska. During the long marches between those battles, his son Maksim fell off a horse and injured his arm which would leave permanent damage. His daughter Nata≈°a suffered from typhoid fever at Neretva and almost died during the crossing of the river. His third and youngest son Vladimir was born after the war. Maksim Krstuloviƒá became a painter and critical intellectual who wrote articles that were more to the left than the Yugoslav politics was at the time.

He served as a group leader from 1943 to 1945, and a division head from 1945 to 1948. He was the scientific director of the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific in 1948, and Assistant Director for Weapons Development from 1949 to 1951.  Early life  Darol Kenneth Froman was born in Harrington, Washington, on October 23, 1906, the son of a farmer. His family moved to Canada in 1910. He entered the University of Alberta in Edmonton, which awarded him the degrees of Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in 1926 and Master of Science (M.Sc.) the following year. He was a summer student at the University of Chicago in 1926 and 1927 before enrolling as a graduate student in 1928. He completed his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) thesis there on A Photographic Method of Determining Atomic Structure Factors in 1930, under the supervision of Arthur Compton. It was subsequently published in the Physical Review. After graduating from the University of Chicago, Froman became a lecturer at the University of Alberta from 1930 to 1931, and was lecturer and assistant professor of physics at Macdonald College at McGill University in Montreal from 1931 to 1939. During the summer months he joined Joyce C. Stearns at Mount Evans or Echo Lake Park to study cosmic rays.  World War II  After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Froman joined the McGill group working on radar and waveguides. In 1941 he became head of the Mount Evans High Altitude Laboratory, working on cosmic ray research, and taught physics at the University of Denver from 1941 to 1942. He joined the Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory in 1942. Later that year Froman joined the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, where he witnessed the start up of Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor, in December 1942. He was one of the earliest arrivals at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he was head of the P-4 (Electronic) Group in Robert Bacher's P (Physics) Division. When the Laboratory was reorganized to concentrate on an implosion-type nuclear weapon in August 1944, he became head of the G-4 (Electric Method) Group in Bacher's G (Gadget) Division.  Later life  Froman remained at Los Alamos after the War, replacing Bacher as head of G Division (now renamed M Division) in 1945. In 1948, he was the scientific director of the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific. He was Assistant Director for Weapons Development from 1949 to 1951. He served as the Associate Technical Director, later renamed Deputy Director, from 1951 until he retired in 1962. As such he was second only to the Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Norris E. Bradbury, and he worked closely with Bradbury, Edward Teller and Stanislaw Ulam on the design of the hydrogen bomb. He was also heavily involved with Project Rover, the project to develop a nuclear thermal rocket. Froman became a consultant professor for the University of New Mexico in 1947. He was also chairman of the board for First National Bank of Rio Arriba, scientific director of Douglas Aircraft, director of development for Espanola Hospital, and a member of the Science Advisory Committee on Ballistic Missiles for the Secretary of Defense. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society and American Nuclear Society and a member of the New York Academy of Sciences and the Association of Los Alamos Scientists. He was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) by the University of Alberta in 1964. Froman was married with two daughters, Kay and Eva. He died in Phoenix, Arizona, on September 11, 1997. In 2009, Danny B. Stillman, a former head of intelligence at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Thomas C. Reed, a weapons designer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and a Secretary of the Air Force, published a book titled The Nuclear Express, in which they presented unsubstantiated allegations that an unnamed American scientist, easily identified as Froman, was a KGB spy who gave the Teller-Ulam design to the Soviet Union. \\"The allegation that Froman was a spy\\", noted Robert Norris, \\"is likely to come as surprise to his colleagues and to many others.\\" In a review of Nuclear Express, Norris, Jeremy Bernstein and Peter Zimmerman concluded that it \\"is an unreliable, often wrong, history of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\\"  Notes   References  * * Category:1906 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Lincoln County, Washington Category:20th-century American physicists Category:University of Alberta alumni Category:University of Alberta faculty Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Manhattan Project people Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society ","title":"Darol Froman"},{"id":"43003967","text":"Toffa Cotonou is a football club of Benin, based in the town of Cotonou.

Starting out as a performer of gothic metal, Vic performed with her own band throughout her whole career amongst co-operations with several other musicians. After she moved to Germany, Vic decided to adjust her performance to the singer-songwriter genre. Vic finds her inspiration for her self-written music in bands, artists and composers such as Ella Fitzgerald, Lisa Gerrard, Edvard Grieg, Queen, Alice in Chains, Tom Waits, and Devin Townsend. Her music accounts for the way to express her emotions by solely using her voice that is often referred to as \\"stunning\\". Her albums, with a wide range from sensitive ballads to shades of blues and folk, are often themed on her state of mind at that time. Her artist name is derived from the surname of Phil Anselmo, singer of the American metal band Pantera which she was a fan of in her youth. Career Throughout her career, Vic was also involved in several interesting co-operations with the likes of Mick Moss (Antimatter), Anneke van Giersbergen (ex-The Gathering) and Duncan Patterson (ex-Anathema) amongst others.

Early life and apprenticeship He was born in Gatcombe, Isle of Wight in 1746. He was twice married, leaving a widow. Wheble was apprenticed in 1756 to \\"the well known bookseller, and publisher\\", John Wilkie, whom he eventually succeeded. Literary career Wheble is most famous for his association with John Horne Tooke and John Wilkes, and the Society of Gentlemen Supporters of the Bill of Rights, having printed pamphlets for them, and publishing articles in \\"The Middlesex Journal\\" in their defence. Matters came to a head on 21 February 1771 when the Speaker of the House of Commons summoned Wheble to Parliament to explain why he had printed a full account of debates in the house, which was at that time against the law. A proclamation for him to appear in Parliament was also made in the name of King George, with a reward of fifty pounds offered for his apprehension. At this development Wilkes concocted a plan to have Wheble brought before him in his capacity as sitting Alderman / Magistrate by a mutual friend (Twine Carpenter), so that the Charges made by Parliament against Wheble could be dismissed. In his letter to the Secretary of State, Lord Halifax, Wilkes wrote \\"That Wheble had been apprehended in violation of the rights of an Englishman, as well as of the chartered privileges of a Citizen of London\\" For his services in these affairs Wheble was granted 100 guineas by the Constitutional Society, and received the thanks of the Corporation of London.

It operated until 1973, when it merged with its primary competitor, Telesistema Mexicano, owned by Emilio Azc√°rraga Vidaurreta, to form the Televisa conglomerate. Televisa absorbed all of TIM's assets, including its television transmitters and its series, including pioneering programs such as El Chavo del Ocho. History =1965-68: From Monterrey south= TIM was founded not in Mexico City, which was the largest media market in the country, but in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, where Garza Sada already owned a brewery (Cervecer√≠a Cuauht√©moc, now part of Heineken) and a glass factory, among other assets. The goal of TIM was to provide an alternative to the television stations located in Mexico City, chiefly XEW-TV on channel 2, XHTV-TV on channel 4, and XHGC-TV on channel 5. In Monterrey TIM received the channel 6 allocation, which it built as XET-TV. It then sought to enter other major Mexican markets before eventually targeting Mexico City, a task that had TIM building stations elsewhere. In Veracruz it built and signed on XHFM-TV channel 2, and in Puebla it created XHP-TV channel 3, placed midway between Veracruz and Mexico City. It was in Puebla that Jos√© Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez, one of Mexico's pioneering sports journalists, got his start. TIM finally entered Mexico City in 1967, in time for the 1968 Summer Olympics. In Mexico City, TIM received a concession for channel 8, which was given the callsign XHTM-TV. It built new facilities in the San √Ångel neighborhood. TIM's entry into Mexico City put it into direct competition with Telesistema Mexicano, which had just been formed between Azc√°rraga, XHTV owner Romulo O'Farrill Jr., and the shares of the deceased Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena (owner of XHGC), for viewers in the nation's capital. =1968-72: At war with Telesistema Mexicano= An intense war broke out between the two giants of Mexican television, the recently formed TIM against Telesistema, who held an iron grip on Mexico City television. During this era TIM produced series such as Los Polivoces, Juan Pirulero and El Chavo del Ocho, originally named after XHTM's channel position. Merger and legacy In 1972, Emilio Azc√°rraga Vidaurreta died. As Garza Sada could not see a way out of the brutal war, he began talking to Azc√°rraga's heir, Emilio Azc√°rraga Milmo. Eight months before Garza Sada's death in September 1973, the two merged, forming Televisi√≥n via Sat√©lite, S.A. de C.V., a business later known as Televisa. The XHTM-based television network was slowly dismantled, with the transmitters being used to broadcast Televisa's other national networks. In 1985, the Mexican government sought to build a channel 7 in Mexico City under the auspices of Imevisi√≥n, which was given the callsign XHIMT-TV. In order to facilitate the additional station, a frequency and callsign change was conducted involving XHTM and Televisa's XEQ-TV channel 9 in Puebla. The end result was that the Mexico City station became XEQ-TV, channel 9. Meanwhile, XEX-TV channel 7 moved to channel 8, while the Puebla XEQ became XHTM-TV, a rebroadcaster of XEW-TV located on channel 10. XEQ was primarily available in Mexico City until Televisa received approval in 1993 to extend its reach with 62 new transmitters. Significant competition in Mexican television would not return until the 1990s and the privatization of Imevisi√≥n into a new company, Televisi√≥n Azteca, which inherited Imevisi√≥n's channels 7 and 13.

FAST is developed as a part of WorldCat by OCLC, Inc., with the goal of making subject cataloging less costly and easier to implement in online contexts. FAST headings separate topical data from non-topical data, such as information about a document's form, chronological coverage, or geographical coverage. Unlike LCSH headings, which are pre-coordinated (multiple terms are linked together by the cataloger in a specific order, e.g. \\"United States -- History\\"), FAST headings are post-coordinated (terms are singly assigned, so the user can mix and match, e.g. \\"United States\\" and \\"History\\"). Use OCLC has been developing FAST since 1998, and originally intended the system to describe Web resources in simple metadata schemata, particularly Dublin Core. FAST separates headings into eight distinct facets: topical, geographic, personal name, corporate name, form, chronological, title as subject, and meeting name. Each facet can be mapped to a specific Dublin Core element. For example, the geographic facet can be mapped to the coverage element in the basic Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, and to the coverage.geographic element in qualified Dublin Core. In keeping with Dublin Core's simplicity, FAST headings are meant to be \\"simple and easy to apply and to comprehend.\\" To facilitate subject assignment, OCLC has developed a tool called assignFast. This tool uses an autocomplete feature to assist catalogers with the details of FAST headings. OCLC has published FAST as linked data under an Open Data Commons Attribution (ODC-By) License.

The album was recorded in a suburb of Melbourne over a 24-hour period in August 2007. The album was first released on Aarght! Records in Australia only on 5 May 2008, then on 9 September 2008 on Goner Records in the United States, and finally in the United Kingdom on Melodic Records on 17 August 2009. \\"Which Way to Go\\" was the only single released from Primary Colours. At the J Awards of 2008, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year. Primary Colours peaked at No. 13 on the ARIA Hitseekers Chart in June 2008. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the album's minimalistic sound and warm, personable lyrics. It won the Australian Music Prize in 2008, and was nominated for the ARIA Award that same year for best rock album, but lost to The Living End's entry, White Noise. Background and recording Eddy Current Suppression Ring formed in 2004, as a group of friends writing and performing songs together for fun. They decided to keep making their music when they discovered that other people liked it. The band recorded their first song as a trio, at a vinyl pressing plant where Eddy Current (real name Mikey Young) was working at the time. After they took a liking to the resulting song, they recruited Rob Solid (real name Brad Barry) to play bass guitar. The group recorded their debut self-titled album in four hours in a rehearsal studio, and released it in 2006 on the Australian label Dropkick Records. They recorded Primary Colours over the night of 3 August 2007 and part of the following day, in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra on an 8-track, a form of multi-track recording. The process of recording it took 24 hours and cost $1500. The day after recording finished, the band and their engineer, Lachlan Wooden, added overdubs to the ten tracks. After recording, Eddy Current Suppression Ring toured the US for three weeks, after which Eddy Current, the band's guitarist, mixed the album during November and December 2007. The four members self- produced Primary Colours. Eddy Current Suppression Ring's lead singer, Brendan Suppression (real name Brendan Huntley), explained the choice of Primary Colours as its title, saying that the band chose it because they \\"believe...that something beautiful can be made through simple colours or notes or lyrics\\". In an interview with The Age, Suppression also said that Primary Colourss title refers to the way that everything is made up of a combination of simple things, as all colours are made by combining primary colours. Primary Colours was originally released in Australia on 5 May 2008 on Eddy Current Suppression Ring's own label, Aarght! Records, before being issued on 9 September 2008 in the United States on Goner Records. In Australia it was distributed by Shock Records. \\"Which Way to Go\\" was released as the only single. The following year, on 17 August, Primary Colours was re-released on Melodic Records in the United Kingdom, in conjunction with the band's eponymous debut album. On this release, the album's title was stylised with a \\"+\\" symbol at the end, with Primary Colours denoted as \\"CD1\\". Primary Colours was originally presented in one of three different album covers ‚Äì one red, one yellow, and one blue. Music and lyrics The lyrics on Primary Colours often focus on mundane topics pertaining to the lives of ordinary people, including watching TV and eating ice cream, while its music often features shredding power chords. According to The Washington Posts Chris Richards, the music represents a new, gentler type of punk rock in the vein of No Age and Abe Vigoda. Richards also wrote that Suppression \\"[keeps] these upbeat rock tunes from becoming too saccharine with a nervy delivery that's part David Byrne, part Iggy Pop\\". A similar sentiment was expressed by David Bevan of Pitchfork Media, who wrote \\"there's a softening of edges taking place throughout, a band testing limits after having already refined them\\". He also described it as an \\"artfully polished extension of its predecessor\\". Current described the album as \\"a bit more '82ish than the '76ish sound of our first LP, slightly less frantic and maybe a bit more palatable\\". The album's opening track, \\"Memory Lane\\", begins with guitar chopping described by Emily Mackay as \\"Stones-meets- Stooges rifforama\\". The second track on the album, \\"Sunday's Coming,\\" is an \\"all-out skronkfest\\" featuring \\"whiplash guitars\\" and \\"so-nonchalant-they‚Äôre- muffled vocals\\". \\"Wrapped Up\\" contains \\"ribbons of guitar melody\\" matched with an \\"equally warm refrain\\". \\"Colour Television\\" consists of \\"five minutes of unhurried, snaky buildups\\" resembling the sound of The Pixies and Future of the Left. \\"That's Inside of Me\\" is a \\"Feelies-esque instrumental\\" with a \\"herky-jerky funk groove\\". The \\"glumly confessional\\" \\"I Admit My Faults\\" focuses on the same mood for its entire duration. \\"Which Way to Go\\", the album's single, begins with heavy riffage, then segues to the verse, then the chorus, then repeats from the beginning. The song's \\"sharp riffs, fiery speak- sing vocals and constant forward momentum\\" exemplify the band's typical sound. \\"You Let Me Be Honest with You\\" is centred on a lead guitar solo from Current. \\"We'll Be Turned On\\" sees Eddy Current Suppression Ring using an organ, and Suppression making an especially \\"goofy turn\\". \\"I Don't Wanna Play No More\\" features a single-note piano riff that recalls \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\". Reception Primary Colours received generally positive critical reception, so much so that Eddy Current Suppression Ring's front man, Current, remarked that it was \\"weird\\" because he didn't \\"know if anyone's said a bad word about it\\". Bevan awarded Primary Colours a rating of 8.2 out of 10. Robert Christgau gave the album a rating of A‚àí, which, according to him, corresponds to \\"the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction\\". He also wrote that they do \\"the same thing punk bands have always done\\" and described the album as a \\"recurring miracle.\\" Chris Richards compared the album to many early punk and post-punk bands such as \\"a breezier Stooges\\" or \\"The Fall with less squall\\". He concluded that the album was \\"the most righteous rock-and-roll moment of 2008\\". A more mixed review written by Emily Mackay awarded Primary Colours a rating of 7 out of 10 and criticised it for its lack of originality. Many critics also praised Current's guitar work on the album, with Richards writing that his riffs \\"come ripping from his amplifier like sunbeams through a smog of distortion\\". Writing for Spin, Chuck Eddy wrote that Current's guitar chords \\"soar Byrds- like or surf Ventures-like out of melodic stomps that seem basic, but aren't\\". K. Ross Hoffman, writing for Allmusic, praised the song \\"Wrapped Up\\" for its \\"strong, slinky riff\\", while Bevan praised it for the way it \\"runs along some really beautiful ribbons of guitar melody\\". =Accolades and commercial performance= On 20 March 2009, Primary Colours won the $30,000 Australian Music Prize for the previous year, defeating eight other nominees, including Cut Copy and the Presets. Eddy Current Suppression Ring told Triple J that they didn't expect their recording plans to change significantly as a result of the win, but that they might be able to do them more quickly. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008, it was nominated in the category \\"Best Rock Album\\", but lost to The Living End's entry, White Noise. Current described this nomination as \\"nice, but mainly hilarious\\". Primary Colours was featured on several critics' year-end lists, including the 2008 Pazz & Jop (No. 73), the Washington Posts David Malitz's top 10 albums of 2008 (No. 5), and The Guardians 2009 critics' poll (No. 28).

It also discusses some personal aspects of her life and career, including her feelings towards President Barack Obama following her 2008 presidential campaign loss to him. It is generally supportive of decisions made by the Obama administration. The book was promoted partly in light of the possibility of a Clinton bid in the 2016 presidential election (in which, two years after the release of the book, she would go on to win the Democratic nomination and then lose to Donald Trump in the general election). Excerpts from the book were released in advance of its publication. Clinton staged an extensive promotional tour for the book, which had the air of a political campaign with groups both for and against her appearing at book-signing events. Hard Choices reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller List, but sold considerably less than her 2003 memoir, Living History. Interpreting what sales of the book meant for her possible political future became a subject for discussion among interested parties. Conception and development Clinton's last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013. As she departed from office, she indicated she was unsure of her future plans but that they did include writing another memoir to follow Living History. On April 4, 2013, Simon & Schuster, her previous publisher, announced that Clinton had signed with them for this new work, with a target publication date of June 2014. Lawyer Robert Barnett handled the negotiations from Clinton's side; the financial terms of any advance or royalties were not publicly disclosed. The New York Post reported \\"industry speculation\\" as saying that her advance could be as high as $14 million. Although not confirmed, that figure has been repeated by some other news sources. From the beginning, the book was partly seen in the light of a possible Clinton bid for the 2016 presidential election. Clinton was assisted in writing the book by three aides credited in the Acknowledgements section as her \\"book team\\", two former State Department assistants, speechwriter Dan Schwerin and researcher Ethan Gelber, and Ted Widmer, a speechwriter in the Bill Clinton administration. The first draft of the manuscript was three times its final length. Clinton later said that the writing process had been \\"terrific\\" overall, but that \\"some days were off-the-charts wonderful and some days were not-even-on-the-charts terrible.\\" During April 2014, the official publication date of the book was announced as June 10, 2014, and the title of the book was revealed as Hard Choices about a week later. Themes of the book The book contained 635 pages of numbered text, accompanied by three sections of plates containing a total of 100 colored photographs. In the book, Clinton frames the foreign policy situations encountered during her tenure as a series of hard choices, especially those involving the Middle East and the Arab Spring, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Russia. Special attention is given to the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and her relations with Egyptian President and longtime personal friend Hosni Mubarak. Clinton sometimes delves into disagreements within the Obama administration and where she stood, such as her losing the argument to arm moderate elements of the Syrian opposition. In many other cases, however, she does not, saying such discussions \\"will remain private to honor the code of confidentiality that should exist between a president and his Secretary of State, especially while he is still in office.\\" A chapter of the book dealing with the 2012 Benghazi attack ‚Äì in which the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to that country, J. Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans ‚Äì was leaked to Politico. It reiterates the explanations for what happened that Clinton and her supporters had previously made. Clinton also delves into some personal aspects of her life and career, including getting past any hard feelings towards Obama from her 2008 presidential campaign, events in her family including her daughter Chelsea Clinton's wedding, and glimpses of personal interaction with citizens of other countries during her travels as secretary. The book also addresses the disappointment of her 2008 loss, and for the first time fully recants her 2002 vote on the Iraq War Resolution that cost her in that campaign, writing that \\"I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn't alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.\\" The book concludes with some general thoughts about her visions for America going forward, but it shed no light on whether she would run for president in 2016, saying only, \\"[t]he time for another hard choice will come soon.\\" Promotional efforts Excerpts of the books came out early. The first was in early May 2014, when Vogue published an excerpt in celebration of Mother's Day that was about and dedicated to Clinton's mother Dorothy Rodham, who had died during Clinton's time as secretary. Simon & Schuster released an Author's Note explaining some of Clinton's perspectives on the book. A video appeared on the book's Facebook page the following day. A cover appearance on People magazine was also made to promote the book. Later, the chapter of the book dealing with the Benghazi attack was leaked to Politico. Observers suspected this was done to get news about it out of the way early so it would not dominate later coverage of the book as a whole. Shortly before the book's publication date, a passage that dealt with the now-repatriated soldier Bowe Bergdahl was made public as well. The promotional book roll-out was staffed by veterans of political campaigns and political communications efforts, rather than the publicists who usually conduct such efforts. There was competition among top news anchors and interviewers to get the first interviews with Clinton about the book. In the end, Clinton sat down with several of them; the first went to ABC News' Diane Sawyer and aired on June 9. The interviews themselves sometimes made news on topics unrelated to those covered by the book, such as Clinton's description to Sawyer of her and Bill's financial state as they left the White House (\\"dead broke\\") and an exchange with NPR's Terry Gross on Clinton's evolving views on same-sex marriage. A later, unannounced appearance on The Colbert Report earned her some positive notices for a comic touch in her mock exchanges with host Stephen Colbert. A promotional book tour in the United States and Canada began on June 10 with a book signing at a Barnes & Noble store in New York that attracted over a thousand people. Other events, sometimes multiple per day, included a public discussion forum in Chicago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration aide. When signing books, she just wrote \\"Hillary\\"; no signing of personal items or extra messages were allowed. Clinton's longtime aide Huma Abedin was in charge of managing each event. The tour events had the air of campaign stops. Each brought considerable local media attention. The independent SuperPAC known as Ready for Hillary parked a \\"Hillary Bus\\" nearby and handed out stickers and posters and signed up volunteers. She herself has never gone on the bus; the Washington Post described it as \\"a campaign bus before there is even a campaign\\". Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee had an intern go around greeting attendees in a large orange squirrel suit. It wore a shirt with the message \\"Another Clinton in the White House is Nuts\\" and was accompanied by other staffers handing out sheets with anti-Clinton talking points. During one promotional appearance in Washington, D.C., Clinton went up to the orange figure and said, \\"Hello, Mr. Squirrel, how are you? I wanted you to get you a copy of my book,\\" adding, \\"you bring a smile to a lot of people's faces.\\" The copy she gave the squirrel was inscribed, \\"Squirrel ‚Äì Please make a hard choice and read my book! Hillary\\". In early July, Clinton went to Europe to stage promotional appearances for the book, visiting England, Germany, and France. Book signings back in the U.S. continued for the rest of that month. The length of the promotional tour recalled her heavy travel schedule as Secretary of State, and largely put to rest questions about her health that had circulated among some since her concussion and blood clot treatment in late 2012. While the appearances and the news coverage of some of her statements during the tour exposed some of Clinton's strengths and weaknesses as a public figure, they did not change Clinton's poll approval numbers. Critical and commercial reception Initial reviews for Hard Choices were generally mixed to favorable. Writing for The New York Times, longtime book critic Michiko Kakutani said that the volume is better than Clinton's previous memoir and that Hard Choices \\"turns out to be a subtle, finely calibrated work that provides a portrait of the former secretary of state and former first lady as a heavy-duty policy wonk.\\" David Ignatius, writing in The Washington Post, said the memoir \\"begins and ends in the empty voice of a campaign speech. But in between, it contains a clear and at times riveting account of Hillary Rodham Clinton's four years as secretary of state.\\" Robin Abcarian of the Los Angeles Times assessed it as \\"a richly detailed and compelling chronicle of Clinton's role in the foreign initiatives and crises that defined the first term of the Obama administration ... told from the point of view of a policy wonk.\\" John Dickerson of Slate magazine characterized it as \\"a risk-free telling of Clinton's world travels\\" and compared it unfavorably to Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War, the recent account by Robert Gates, Clinton's cabinet colleague as Secretary of Defense. Dickerson added, \\"Clinton's account is the low-salt, low-fat, low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert. She goes on at great length, but not great depth.\\" Michael Scherer of Time magazine declared, \\"This is a campaign book, written by a candidate (via her speechwriters), processed through a political machine, and delivered to the public with the contradictory goals of depicting the author as a decisive leader and not betraying any evidence of leadership that would turn a voter off.\\" Ed Pilkington of The Guardian wrote that it was a less overt campaign manifesto than Barack Obama's The Audacity of Hope had been in 2006, but \\"still manages to adroitly position Clinton for a 2016 presidential bid.\\" Peter Baker of the New York Times Book Review compared it somewhat unfavorably with former State Secretary Dean Acheson's 1969 memoir, Present at the Creation: My Years in the State Department, concluding his review by alluding to Clinton's possible presidential aspirations by saying that \\"Acheson won a Pulitzer Prize for his memoir. Clinton seems to have a bigger prize in mind.\\" By the time of the book's publication, it was said to have already received one million pre- orders. In actuality, Simon & Schuster said that it during its first week on sale, it sold over 100,000 copies, a figure supported by extrapolation of the underlying Nielsen BookScan data. It debuted at first on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction. During its second and third weeks of availability, sales of Hard Choices declined markedly, but were still enough to keep it atop the Times Best Sellers list. In the fourth week, sales declined again and the book surrendered the top spot on the Times Best Sellers list to Edward Klein's Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, a lurid and lightly sourced account of purported rivalries between the two couples and within each marriage. By this point, Hard Choices had sold some 177,000 physical copies. By the end of July, the book had sold about 250,000 copies overall, including an estimate for e-book sales. In all, it spent twelve weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list, nine of them in the top five.See and which was its last week on the list. Whether sales for the book were living up to expectations, or indicated a lack of public interest in hearing from Clinton, became an immediate subject for public relations and political spin from interested parties. Its sales were better than those of memoirs by other former members of the Obama administration, but were considerably less than they had been in the comparable period for Clinton's first memoir Living History. The publisher explained this as partly due to the differing contents of the two memoirs and partly due to the declining market for physical, nonfiction books over the decade between the two. In any case, Simon & Schuster was unlikely to make back Clinton's advance or to sell all the copies it had shipped. Politico termed the book's sales \\"a solid figure in a depleted publishing industry but far from the juggernaut her backers hoped for.\\" The book continued to accumulate sales into the year following its publication. By March 2015, Nielsen BookScan had it selling 264,000 copies, and figure that rose to 280,000 copies by July 2015 and 292,200 copies by March 2016. By mid-2015, Clinton had earned more than $5 million in royalties from the book. Compared to recent books published by the many 2016 Republican presidential candidates, her sales were well short of Ben Carson's One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America's Future, but were well ahead of those of any of the others, with only the combined sales of a pair of books by Donald Trump coming close. By late November 2015, counting both print and e-books, Time magazine said Hard Choices had sold a little over 340,000 units.  Foreign editions and translations  The Italian language edition, Scelte difficili, on sale at a bookstore in Florence Simon & Schuster viewed international and foreign language sales as key to the book's potential for success. On its initial release date of June 10, it was published in Canada, Great Britain, Australia, India, Germany, the Netherlands, and France. A Spanish language translation, Decisiones dif√≠ciles, was released on June 24 in the U.S. Altogether, foreign rights to the book were sold in sixteen countries. While also available in Hong Kong and Taiwan, Hard Choices was effectively banned in mainland China as publishers there declined to purchase either the translation or English- language distribution rights for the book. Although Chinese publishers did not offer a specific reason for declining to buy the book, Simon & Schuster asserted that the ban was politically motivated as import agencies and publishers were fearful of retaliation by the Chinese government for printing material that was too politically sensitive, such as the chapter-length coverage of Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng and Clinton's generally critical comments about the Chinese government. Paperback version The paperback version of Hard Choices followed the hardcover and was released on April 28, 2015, two weeks after the announcement of her 2016 presidential campaign. The new epilogue from the paperback edition, titled \\"A New Chapter\\", was initially published by The Huffington Post by Clinton on April 10. The paperback version also has a new cover, in color, in which Clinton is angled away from the camera, turning her head and smiling slightly, while dressed in a blue, collared shirt and wearing bold silver earrings.

Simmons, All Souls: An Oxford College and its Buildings (Oxford: OUP, 1989), p. 91 History The series began formally in 1912, but the idea that All Souls College, Oxford might sponsor an independent series of academic lectures can be dated back to 1873, or even earlier. The College had already started to establish a series of professorships, the Chichele Professorships, beginning with the first two in 1859 and 1862, who delivered their own courses of \\"Chichele lectures\\". This series of lectures, separate from the professorships, can be traced to a proposal made in 1873 by Thomas Ryburn Buchanan that the College invite a distinguished foreign professor to lecture. He later withdrew his suggestion in the face of competing ideas. But on 1 June 1909, a proposal was approved that the College would set aside ‚Ç§300 for three \\"Chichele Lectures\\" in foreign history, along the lines of the already established Ford Lectures. The first lecture was held in 1912. In 1919, the College widened the lecture to include law, political theory, or economic, as well as foreign and British history. Nevertheless, the lectureship was dormant from 1920 until it was revived again briefly in 1933, but was dormant again until 1947. In recent years, lectures have been given by several lecturers on a common theme as well as continuing the tradition of having a single lecturer. The lectures have normally been given in the Old Library at All Souls, but in 1959 it was moved for the first time to accommodate the great crowd drawn by Field Marshall Montgomery.

Background The invasion and occupation of the island of Sakhalin had been considered by the Japanese government from the early stages of the Russo-Japanese War, and the plan was actively promoted by General Gaishi Nagaoka, a senior member of the Imperial General Headquarters. However, the plan was vetoed, primarily due to opposition by the Imperial Japanese Navy. On 7 June 1905, shortly after the Battle of Tsushima, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt met with Japanese diplomat Kaneko Kentar≈ç and the issue was reconsidered. Roosevelt agreed with the Japanese assessment that the invasion and occupation of Sakhalin was now necessary, as only the threat of direct loss of Russian territory would bring Tsar Nicholas II to consider a negotiated settlement to the war.. Japan and Russia had previously shared ownership of Sakhalin; however, the Japanese relinquished their claims in the 1875 Treaty of Saint Petersburg in exchange for undisputed sovereignty over all of the Kuril Islands. By 1904, Sakhalin had an estimated 30,000 inhabitants, including around 4,000 Ainu. The island was used as a prison and a place of exile for political dissidents, and did not figure prominently in Russian strategic plans. The island was noted for its harsh climate, isolation, and the high level of corruption of its ruling bureaucrats, and consequently little investment was made in its defence. The Imperial Russian Army had a garrison on Sakhalin with a nominal strength of 7,280 men. However, many of these men were conscripted farmers, hunters, or political prisoners with minimal training or equipment. Russian General Mikhail Nikolaevich Lyapunov had been a lawyer before the war, and had limited formal military training. The Imperial Japanese Army invasion force consisted of 14,000 men of the newly formed IJA 13th Division under General Haraguchi Kensai, supported by a naval force led by Admiral Kataoka Shichir≈ç, consisting of four armored cruisers (under Vice Admiral Dewa Shiget≈ç), four protected cruisers (under Rear Admiral T≈çg≈ç Masamichi), four coastal defense ships, nine destroyers and twelve torpedo boats. The battle The Japanese force commenced landing operations on 7 July 1905, with the main force landing between Aniva and Korsakov without opposition, and a second landing party nearer to Korsakov itself, where it destroyed a battery of field artillery after short combat. The Japanese moved on to occupy Korsakov on 8 July, which was set on fire by the retreating Russian garrison after having been defended for 17 hours by 2,000 men led by Colonel Josef Arciszewski. The Japanese moved north, taking the village of Vladimirovka (present-day Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk) on 10 July, the same day that a new Japanese detachment landed at Cape Notoro. Colonel Arciszewski dug in to resist the Japanese, but was outflanked and forced to flee into the mountainous interior of the island. He surrendered with his remaining men on 16 July. About 200 Russians were captured while the Japanese suffered 18 dead and 58 wounded. On 24 July, the Japanese landed in northern Sakhalin near Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinski. In northern Sakhalin, the Russians had about 5,000 troops under the direct command of General Lyapunov. Because of the numerical and material superiority of the Japanese, the Russians withdrew from the city and surrendered a few days later on 31 July 1905. Results The Japanese occupied Sakhalin with minimal effort and low losses. The Russians lost 181 dead and had 3,270 taken prisoner. The reasons for the low Russian resistance lay in the low morale of the soldiers, who were mostly prisoners and deportees with little or no military training. Per the terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth ending the Russo-Japanese War, the southern half of Sakhalin was ceded to Japan, with the 50th parallel north as the boundary line, becoming Karafuto Prefecture.

The museum grounds on Round Top Mountain, a plateau connected to Monte Sano Mountain, were the estate of local physician William Burritt, who willed his house and land to the city for use as a museum upon his death in 1955. A number of 19th-century rural structures have been added to Burritt's mansion, both in the interest of historical preservation and life re-enactment. History William Henry Burritt was born in Huntsville in 1869. A great- great-grandson of Rev. Blackleach Burritt, he followed in his father, grandfather's and great-grandfather's footsteps, becoming a physician and set up practice in 1891. In 1900 he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, with his second wife. There he became involved in managing farming, logging, and mining operations, and in rubber production, where he received 22 patents for his tire inventions. See also: Burritt returned to Huntsville after his wife's death in 1934 and designed an eccentric mansion surrounded by 167 acres (68 ha) where he would farm and raise goats in his retirement. In addition to eclectic decorative design, the house featured straw insulation, inspired by a visit on a hot day to a Missouri farm. On June 6, 1936, the day Burritt moved into the mansion, it burned to the ground due to an electrical fire, exacerbated by the straw insulation and its protective metal panels. The mansion was rebuilt, and Burritt lived there until his death in 1955. Having no heirs, Burritt donated his house and property to the city for the purpose of establishing a museum. The museum began purchasing rural log houses and barns that were in danger of demolition, and relocating them to the grounds. Three structures were moved to the museum between 1964 and 1974. The park is divided into two areas: 1850 and 1900, with buildings, furniture, and tools from each time period. Today, twelve 19th century structures have been fully restored and are part of the museum. Exhibits Major 19th century buildings in the historic park include the Balch House, originally built in 1887 near Harvest; the Chandler House, a dogtrot house from Lester in Limestone County; an 1884 church that originally stood in downtown Madison; the Meals House, an 1845 cabin from near Lester; the Smith-Williams House, an 1868 marriage of two 1840s structures originally from McKay Hollow at the foot of Monte Sano; and an 1890s barn from near Minor Hill, Tennessee. The museum also features two buildings that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Burritt Mansion, and the Joel Eddins House. Non-historic structures include a welcome center, administrative building, a replica of a four-room Rosenwald school, and an events center designed to look like the demolished Hotel Monte Sano. =William Burritt Mansion= The Burritt Mansion has a two-story, octagonal main section with 4 one-story wings forming an X shape. Off the rear of the house on the east end is a conservatory. The exterior walls are covered in grey asbestos shingles, mimicking a stone construction. All of the roofs, except the pedimented portico, are flat and hidden by a stepped parapet topped with concrete caps. The two-story main entry portico is supported by two fluted Doric columns. The front door is in a Federal Style with sidelights and topped with a fanlight. The second story of the portico features a small balcony. On the face of the pediment, a panel reads \\"1935\\", the construction date of the original house. A terrace runs the length of the front of the house. Small porches with entries similar to the main entry are between the wings on the south and north sides of the house. Windows on the first floor are casements with eight panes in each side and eight panes in a transom-like panel above. The house has chimneys at the ends of the north, south, and west wings, and two interior chimneys in the north wing and in the center of the main block. The main entry opens into a hall containing a spiral staircase. The west wing (off the entry hall to the left) is a large parlor, while the south wing (to the right) is the master suite, consisting of a study and bedroom. The northeastern part of the main block is a dining room, off of which the north wing contains the kitchen and a bedroom, and the east wing contains a sitting room and a bedroom. Upstairs, an observatory room sits on the front of the house, with a view of the city below, and behind it are a bedroom and small kitchen. Many of the rooms have been converted into gallery space which host rotating exhibits, usually historical and cultural topics relating to North Alabama. The house was listed on the National Register in 1992. =Joel Eddins House= The Eddins House was built in 1810 near Ardmore in Limestone County. The -story hall and parlor log home was moved to Burritt in 2007. The house was listed on the National Register in 1996.

The player controls one of three anthropomorphic animal protagonists: the dragon Lilac, the wildcat Carol, or the basset hound Milla. Aided by the duck-like Torque, the player attempts to defeat Lord Brevon, who plans to conquer the galaxy. While the game focuses on fast-paced platforming, its levels are interspersed with slower action scenes. The game began development as a Sonic the Hedgehog fangame using characters created by DeviantArt user Ziyo Ling for its main cast. Early into development, DiDuro lost interest in creating a derivative work and reconceived the project as his own intellectual property. Sash Lilac, originally a hedgehog, became a dragon; antagonist Doctor Eggman was replaced by Lord Brevon; and the Sonic series' ring-based health system was abandoned. Further changes were suggested by fans and incorporated throughout development. Freedom Planet was developed in Denmark and the United States, with its art direction carrying East Asian influences, such as medieval Chinese art inspiring its background visuals. With development focused on the Microsoft Windows platform, the game started out as a demo first released in August 2012 and was, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, released in its entirety via Steam in July 2014. Freedom Planet was later released on the Wii U in October 2015, on the PlayStation 4 in 2017, and on the Nintendo Switch in August 2018. Critics praised its gameplay, aesthetics, and balance of Sonic elements with original content, but were mixed on its pacing and length. A sequel, Freedom Planet 2, was announced in late-2015 and is in development. Gameplay heads-up display shows that her health, represented by red leaves, is partially depleted. More leaves that can be collected are visible onscreen. Freedom Planet is a two-dimensional (2D) platform and action game. The player directs one of three characters‚ÄîLilac, Carol, or Milla‚Äîto run and jump through levels and destroy robotic enemies. Levels contain obstacles such as corkscrews, loop-the-loops, hills, ramps, and rock walls. The player fights a miniboss in the middle of each level and a main boss at the end, after which the story is advanced by cutscenes. Because of its aesthetics, level design, and fast-paced gameplay, Freedom Planet has been compared to the Sonic the Hedgehog games released for the Sega Genesis in the early 1990s. Unlike in Sonic, the player character has a hit point meter instead of a ring-based health system. To refill this meter, the player collects red leaves dropped by enemies and scattered throughout levels. Lilac's and Carol's maximum health are seven leaves, Milla's is four. Being hit by enemies' and bosses' attacks reduces the character's health, and a life is deducted when no health remains. If all lives are lost, a game over screen appears; however, the player may freely restart from the last checkpoint. Extra lives can be found within levels, as can shield and invincibility-type power-ups. Lilac fights one of the game's bosses, the Robopanther, while Carol assists her with attacks and Milla with extra health. Each of the playable characters make use of an \\"attack\\" and \\"special\\" button. Lilac and Carol both make use of an energy gauge on the heads-up display, which recharges on its own and limits the use of their special moves. The gauge can be recharged quicker by collecting crystals and keystones. Lilac's basic attacks consist of strong but sluggish hair whips, an uppercut into the air, a crouching kick, and a dive kick from mid-air. The Dragon Cyclone, used by pressing jump mid-air, lets Lilac spin like a spinning top and deal touch damage but also acts as a double jump with reduced gravity. Pressing the special button with a full energy gauge activates the Dragon Boost, an eight-directional air dash that deals heavy touch damage and makes her temporarily invincible. Carol regularly attacks with a cycle of three fast but weak punches, which is changed into a single strong claw attack while rolling or pouncing. The pounce acts as Carol's double jump, slightly moving her forward. Her special attack is a series of rapid kicks which steadily consume a fifth of the energy gauge and give her invincibility. Collecting a fuel tank mid-stage allows her to change into a \\"motorcycle mode\\", where her top speed is increased and her acceleration doubled. During \\"motorcycle mode\\", the double jump becomes a rolling attack and gets the same properties as Lilac's cyclone move. Pressing \\"special\\" on- ground triggers a nitro boost that consumes energy. For vertical mobility, the normal Carol is able of doing a wall jump, \\"motorcycle mode\\" Carol can ride up walls. Another set piece only Carol can interact with properly are jump pads, which are placed in a set order and lead to alternating paths by jumping off of them in succession. Milla, who does not have an energy gauge, can create a cube of energy by holding down the attack button, which she can then throw at enemies. Holding down the special button lets her pull out her shield that can reflect projectiles. Pressing \\"special\\" while holding a cube lets Milla use the Super Shield Burst, a strong mid-range beam which pushes Milla in the opposite direction. Milla can fly for a short time while holding the jump button mid-air by flapping her ears like wings. The player may complete the game in either the \\"Adventure\\" mode with all cutscenes or \\"Classic\\" mode, which omits them In Adventure mode, upon first starting the game, players are only given the option to select from either Lilac or Carol after a cutscene, in which the two temporarily split up. Milla is unlocked by clearing the second stage, Relic Maze, as either Lilac or Carol. Once a stage been cleared for the first time, it is unlocked in the character's time attack mode, wherein the player tries to finish the level in the fastest possible time. Players earn achievements by accomplishing certain goals, such as completing the game as a character or defeating an end boss with a special move. Plot The game begins as Sash Lilac and Carol Tea‚Äîan anthropomorphic dragon and wildcat ‚Äîrescue a duck-billed creature named Torque after his spacecraft crash lands. At Torque's request, the three set out to protect a powerful relic called the Kingdom Stone. This involves them in a conflict between three nations on their planet: Shuigang, a country militarized by its new king, Dail; Shang Mu, led by the wealth-obsessed Mayor Zao ( or ); and Shang Tu, whose Royal Magister is unprepared for war. Lilac and Carol rush to the Kingdom Stone's shrine but are waylaid by the Shang Tu officers General Gong and Neera Li, who doubt that the Stone is threatened. The protagonists arrive just as the Stone is stolen by Spade, a henchman hired by Zao. After the shrine collapses, Carol is separated from Lilac and pinned by rubble but gets saved by the timid basset hound Milla () Basset. Gong and Neera are initially unimpressed with Carol's and Lilac's claims of a planned Kingdom Stone heist. That night, Torque tells Lilac, Carol, and Milla that he is an alien sent to apprehend the intergalactic warlord Arktivus Brevon, whose spacecraft wrecked on the planet. Brevon has invaded Shuigang, murdered its king, and brainwashed prince Dail to be his servant. He intends to steal the Stone to power his ship. The protagonists decide to reclaim the Stone from Zao but they are accosted en route by Spade and Brevon's assistant Serpentine. In a conversation with Spade, it's revealed that he secretly worked for his half- brother Dail all along. Talking to Spade soon falls short as the group is suddenly attacked by Serpentine using one of his mechs. The delays given by the chase give Dail and Brevon's forces time to steal the relic. Afterwards, Zao sends the protagonists as emissaries to Shang Tu to discuss an alliance against Shuigang. Traveling by airship, the team gets ambushed by Shuigang's sky battalion and they crash into a river leading to Shang Tu. Arriving at the palace, they are detained by the Magister, as Neera accuses them of trying to cover up Zao's crimes. After an unsuccessful attempt of Milla to break out of jail, Torque is acquitted when Lilac falsely pleads guilty. Lilac, Carol, and Milla quickly break out together to reunite with Torque, only to see him captured by Brevon and Serpentine. Carol quarrels with Lilac and storms off. Lilac sends Milla to find her and then goes to save Torque from Brevon's nearby base, but she is captured and tortured by Brevon. Meanwhile, Carol and Milla ally with Spade to storm the base, where they rescue Torque and Lilac. They are all separated in the ensuing conflict. Neera finds Lilac, arrests her, and brings her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister determines that she is innocent and reveals that Zao is challenging Shuigang for the Stone. Lilac rejoins her friends and convinces Shang Mu and Shang Tu to unite against Dail and Brevon's army. During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, Lilac and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical tent and sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone. The realization of the Kingdom Stone persisting in a different form brought an end to the war. Torque says goodbye to Lilac, Carol, and Milla and returns to space. Development Freedom Planet was conceived in late 2011 by American game designer and programmer Stephen DiDuro, who had just founded the independent developer GalaxyTrail Games a few years prior. Using the Multimedia Fusion 2 engine, the game was intended be a small Flash game to \\"hone [his] skills as a game designer\\" but quickly grew to become an full indie game set in an original universe. After struggling to find a fitting name for the game, it was made up of the first two words that came in DiDuro's mind, \\"freedom\\" and \\"planet\\". Before becoming its own intellectual property, the game started off as a Sonic fangame; a version of the game only seen in early footage show rings and Doctor Eggman as the game's main antagonist. Early on, DiDuro had decided that the Sonic affiliation would hold back the game. By the time of the first publicly released demo, the rings were replaced with red leaves and the characters' abilities were altered. Charging energy for special moves was dependent on Lilac's movement speed was changed to be generating gradually instead as it proved too difficult to control. The physics and controls were also tweaked to be more responsive and tight; running up walls was made easier and jumps were less floaty to allow player to dodge enemy attacks more easily. While the game retained the \\"speed platform gameplay\\", it took it in a different direction by introducing combat mechanics based on one of Strife's earlier Sonic fan projects. \\"Instead of jumping on robots to destroy them, you fight them with punches, kicks, and special attacks\\", according to DiDuro. In an interview, DiDuro described Freedom Planet as \\"a nod to ‚Äô90s-style Japanese platform games, like Sonic, Mega Man, and a little bit of Gunstar Heroes\\". Lilac's Dragon Boost is based on a game mechanic from Ristar, where the titular character slams its body against enemies in a similar fashion. Carol's Wild Kick ability resembles Chun-Li's signature special attack, and her wall kick feels similar to the one found in the Mega Man X games for SNES. Milla's floating ability as well as the ability to pick up items are based on Yoshi's flutter jump and Super Mario 2's throwing mechanics respectively. While the game was developed in Denmark and the United States, its art direction was influenced by medieval East Asian art, particularly that of China. The game's visuals reference modern science fiction and fantasy as well. Much of the text in the game world is written in Chinese characters, and the logo includes a subtitle written in Japanese katakana, , despite the game originally lacking Japanese language support. When DiDuro first attempted to design his own protagonist for the game, it was unsuccessful. Browsing on the art website DeviantArt, he soon discovered Chinese artist Ziyo Ling, requesting and getting permission to use her characters Sash Lilac, followed by Carol Tea and Milla, for his game. Lilac, originally conceived as a hedgehog, was redesigned to be a dragon after criticism about her similar looks to Sonic were made. The design of Robotnik's replacement Lord Brevon, originally named Dr. Brevon, was inspired by Dr. Sloth, one of DiDuro's favorite characters from Neopets. The soundtrack was composed by DiDuro in collaboration with Leila \\"Woofle\\" Wilson and Shane \\"Blue Warrior\\" Ellis, the latter having contributed to two of the game's tracks before leaving the project. DiDuro would often provide a base composition in MIDI format, with Woofle creating the final arrangement but also create additional compositions. Voice actor Dawn M. Bennett, the voice of Lilac, provided voice samples for the tracks Relic Maze 1 and Pangu Lagoon 1 respectively. There were disagreements on the direction of the soundtrack sometimes, with DiDuro wanting \\"fast-paced and in-your-face from the get-go\\" while Woofle aimed for more \\"fly-by-night\\"; starting \\"quieter and more happy\\" and progressively getting intense. Woofle mentioned the track Sky Battalion to have been the hardest thing to compose, stating that it was \\"the low point in [her] entire career\\", it wasn‚Äôt a song that she felt was \\"appropriate for the game\\". Regardless, Woofle described DiDuro as \\"a great musician and (...) easy to collab with\\". Post-release, the game would still receive updates, such as an update in December 2015 that made Milla accessible in Adventure mode. Updates to make Torque, and Spade playable characters were planned for release in 2016 but have been postponed to focus on the sequel. Another reason, according to DiDuro, were his displeasure with the way Torque felt in the existing stages.  Release  Freedom Planet was first released as a demo for Microsoft Windows in August 2012, to positive reception. After a full version of the game was funded through Kickstarter, it was taken to Steam Greenlight and approved for Steam. Its release was first projected for early 2014, then delayed to June 30. Shortly before that date, it was delayed again to July 19; the developers wanted to promote the game at a convention in Miami, Florida, and to avoid competition from the heavily discounted products in Steam's Summer Sale. The game was released, after a third delay, on July 21, since Steam didn't allow games to be released on weekends. Coinciding with the game's release, GalaxyTrail released Freedom Planet - Official Soundtrack, a digital version of the soundtrack, as DLC. To advertise the game, GalaxyTrail created branded T-shirts, and Lilac was included as an easter egg in the 2013 game Sonic: After the Sequel. DiDuro considered and rejected the idea of developing an Android version of Freedom Planet, but stated to be saving money to port the game to the PlayStation Vita. The game was released on the website GOG.com in late 2014. GalaxyTrail also developed versions for Mac OS X and Linux, which were released on Steam on April 17, 2015. On March 9, 2015, Stephen DiDuro announced through Twitter that a version of the game for Nintendo's Wii U console was planned for release on the eShop online store for late 2015, later specified as August 13. A demo was released as part of a promotion titled \\"Nindies@home\\", wherein players were invited to try several upcoming Wii U games between June 15 and 22. On July 28, GalaxyTrail confirmed that production of the final version of the game was taking longer than expected, suggesting that the game's release would be later. DiDuro announced the cause of the delay on August 18; the Wii U version had been set back by a \\"console-freezing bug\\", which would postpone the Wii U release indefinitely until the issue was fixed. He later explained that the bug had taken so long to detect because it only occurred in retail versions of the console, preventing GalaxyTrail and Nintendo from learning of the issue. The bug required a hard reset of the system to address the problem, which could potentially cause damage to the Wii U hardware. The bug was eventually fixed, and the game was successfully released on the eShop on October 1; customers who had tried the game's demo were rewarded with a 15-percent discount. On the American Nintendo eShop, Freedom Planet was a best-seller, peaking at the 2nd spot, right behind Super Mario Maker. In November 2015, GalaxyTrail joined forces with the subscription box company IndieBox distribute an exclusive physical release of Freedom Planet. This limited collector's edition box included a flash-drive with a DRM-free game file, the official two-disc soundtrack, an instruction manual and Steam key, along with various custom- designed collectibles. On June 29, 2016, GalaxyTrail announced that the Steam and Wii U versions of Freedom Planet combined have sold over 250,000 times. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released by Xseed Games on August 30, 2018. Quality of live updates present in the Switch version as well as the newly added language options were released for the remaining versions soon after. In 2019, GalaxyTrail teamed up with Limited Run Games to distribute a physical release of the Switch version. Switch Limited Run #35: Freedom Planet and Freedom Planet Deluxe Edition, which includes a cover with interior art and full-color booklet, were up for pre-order. The Deluxe Edition also includes the two-disc soundtrack, a reversible poster, as well as a Genesis- style case. Reception =Prerelease= Tony Ponce of Destructoid reacted positively about the demo for Freedom Planet; and commented that it was \\"nice to see a well-established style or formula applied to a new world with original characters\\". Similarly, Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef described the game's preview as \\"an indie Sonic-esque platformer done right\\", and enjoyed the redesigned health system. Dominic Tarison of IndieStatik complimented the game's \\"new and unfamiliar configuration\\" of elements from classic 16-bit games, but criticized the amount of viewable gameplay area. John Polson of IndieGames.com believed that \\"the spectacles like loops and wall runs ... [are not] as magical to do or watch\\" as in Sonic games, but he encouraged platformer fans to download the demo. Nathan Grayson of Kotaku praised the demo for its balance of Genesis Sonic elements and original content: he described the product as \\"a love letter to classic Sonic, except when it's not\\". He praised the game's enemies, but experienced minor control issues. Pacing was remarked to be slower than that of the Genesis Sonic games because of the added combat sequences, though Grayson felt that this gave the player time to explore and appreciate the level design. Grayson was critical of the voice acting. Ponce strongly praised the visuals, though criticized the bland foreground design. Polson noted minor audio and visual flaws, most notably the recycling of sound effects from Genesis Sonic games, but he lauded the game's music. Tarison praised the music and visuals, as well as the varied designs of the environments and playable characters. =Post-release= Reviewing the full version, Jahanzeb Khan of Hardcore Gamer felt that it was a worthy successor to the 1994 game Sonic 3 & Knuckles‚Äîwhich he considered the series' pinnacle‚Äîand that it was \\"perhaps the most Sonic game to have come out since 1994, one that feels like a true evolution and more importantly a resounding step forward.\\" Jonatan Allin of the Danish version of Eurogamer, who had not enjoyed any Sonic games since the Genesis era, concurred with Khan. Polygon's Griffin McElroy argued that Freedom Planet successfully performs \\"a difficult balancing act, borrowing and transforming elements from games like Sonic the Hedgehog and Rocket Knight Adventures without coming off as derivative\\". McElroy and Pablo Taboada of the Spanish-language website MeriStation both compared the game to the work of developer Treasure. Taboada lamented the game's obscurity and suggested that, had Treasure obtained the rights to Sonic and released Freedom Planet as an official sequel, it would have been more popular. Khan commented that the levels \\"never feel like they're over too soon nor do they drag on unnecessarily\\", and he appreciated the setpiece moments such as \\"explosive chase/escape sequences, maze like labyrinths, traps, and even shoot-'em-up style shooting segments\\". Taboada was mixed on the game's brevity: he thought it was suitable for speedrunning but unsatisfying for those seeking a deeper experience. By contrast, Japanese website 4Gamer stated that the game's quirks allowed one to play extensively without boredom, and Taboada enjoyed the large, Metroidvania-style levels. Regarding the game's visuals, Taboada said, \\"T√©cnicamente es excelso\\" (technically, it is excellent). He praised the colorful and detailed backgrounds, expressive character animations, sound effects, and music. Khan agreed: he commented that \\"every inch of it exud[es] artistic diversity with high resolution sprites that resemble the quality of yesteryear\\". He called the audio a \\"nice mix of catchy chiptune style melodies with infectious synthetic beats\\". Both Khan and 4Gamer were intrigued by the game's East Asian visual style. Taboada believed that each character was likable and interesting to play. Allin found himself unexpectedly captivated by the story, which he guessed many players would miss due to impatience with cutscenes. Sequel Development on the second game in the series had been announced in late-2015, in form of a teaser trailer animated by Dan Taylor. With the goal of \\"defin[ing] Freedom Planet's identity as a franchise\\", the game introduces new mechanics and makes changes based on past feedback. Due to the success of Freedom Planet, its sequel is completely self-funded this time, and no Kickstarter campaign has been planned for it. Freedom Planet 2 has been promoted through several preview trailers on the GalaxyTrail YouTube channel. In early-2017, alongside trailers that show gameplay of the trio, Neera Li had been revealed to join the game's roster as the fourth playable character.

The first plan of Perth, developed in 1829 by the Surveyor-General, John Septimus Roe, was a semi- regular grid pattern bounded by Mount Eliza to the west, wetlands to the north, with three principal streets running parallel to the Swan River and three streets running north‚Äìsouth. The original allotments ran through from street to street in a north‚Äìsouth direction so that properties generally had two frontages. Following the completion of the central Perth railway station in 1881, the area bounded by William and Barrack Streets was consolidated as the commercial and retail centre of Perth. Banks, insurance buildings, professional and commercial offices were constructed along St Georges Terrace, with businesses, shops and warehouses developing in Wellington, Murray and Hay Streets. A number of hotels and theatres were also built in this central area and large department stores, such as Foy & Gibson and Sandover established along the tram route and the shopping strip along Hay Street. Shopping arcades and passageways were also developed in this period, allowing people to move with ease through the increasingly busy Perth streets and providing spaces for additional commercial premises outlets within the narrow blocks.

It was designed and developed by the United States Forest Service to quantify and value ecosystem services provided by trees including pollution removal, carbon sequestration, avoided carbon emissions, avoided stormwater runoff, and more. i-Tree provides baseline data so that the growth of trees can be followed over time, and is used for planning purposes. Different tools within the i-Tree Suite use different types of inputs and provide different kinds of reports; some tools use a 'bottom up' approach based on tree inventories on the ground, while other tools use a 'top down' approach based on remote sensing data. i-Tree is peer-reviewed and has a process of ongoing collaboration to improve it. There are seven different i-Tree applications which can enhance an individual's or organization's understanding of the benefits which trees provide in modern society. Over the course of many years the U.S. Forest Service has developed and refined these different applications: i-Tree Eco, i-Tree Landscape, i-Tree Hydro, i-Tree Design, i-Tree Canopy, i-Tree Species, and i-Tree MyTree. History i-Tree began in 2002 as survey of a sample of urban forest to simulate taking a tree inventory of an entire urban forest. It then added hand held devices for efficient inventory of street trees. The current version of i-Tree includes different tools which allow for several sources of data to be used, such as National Land Cover Data, Google Maps, and tree inventories. Some tools use continuous data on air pollution and meteorology for more accurate results.
