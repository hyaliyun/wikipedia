Based on the novel Powwow Highway by David Seals, it features A Martinez, Gary Farmer, Joanelle Romero and Amanda Wyss. Wes Studi and Graham Greene, who were relatively unknown actors at the time, have small supporting roles. Plot A member of the Northern Cheyenne tribe of Lame Deer, Montana, Buddy Red Bow (Martinez), a quick-tempered activist, is battling greedy developers. On the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation he tries to persuade the council to vote against a strip-mining contract. Philbert Bono (Farmer) is a hulk of a man guided by sacred visions. He wants to find his medicine, and gather tokens from the spirits. He trades some marijuana for his \\"war pony\\" ‚Äì a rusted out, beat up 1964 Buick Wildcat he names \\"Protector.\\" Meanwhile, Buddy's estranged sister, Bonnie, is arrested in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Buddy is the only family member who can help her and her children, Jane and Sky Red Bow. Buddy does not own a car, but needs to get to his sister. His childhood acquaintance Philbert offers him a ride in his rundown car. In their childhood, Buddy found Philbert awkward and embarrassing, and Philbert was bullied for being fat. Buddy's attitude towards Philbert had not changed very much, but he needs a ride. They set out on their road trip, and Philbert's easygoing ways and insistence on frequent stops to pray and eat prove irritating at first to Buddy, and the men argue. But along the way, they meet with friends in other communities, attend a Pow wow at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation where Buddy dances with other veterans, and visit the sacred Black Hills in South Dakota where Philbert reverently leaves a giant Hershey's chocolate bar as an offering to his ancestors. Eventually Buddy joins Philbert in praying and singing to the ancestors in a river. Gradually, the men grow to appreciate and respect one another. When they finally reach Santa Fe, they meet up with Bonnie's friend Rabbit. Philbert receives inspiration in a glimpse of a scene from an old western on TV, and breaks Bonnie out of jail. Their escape almost ends in tragedy, but with a little help they make their way back to Montana. Music Several songs by Robbie Robertson, from his 1987 solo album, accompany scenes in the film.

It is the mission of Pathways to Housing to transform individual lives by ending homelessness and supporting recovery. The organization is the originator of the Housing First model of addressing homelessness among people with severe psychiatric disabilities and substance use disorders. In Los Angeles, California in 1988, the \\"Housing First\\" Program at Beyond Shelter was launched by Tanya Tull in response to a sharp increase in the number of homeless families with children. As an innovative model, Housing First has been nationally successful at addressing homelessness largely due to its focus on consumer choice.Tsemberis, S., Gulcur, L. and Nakae, M. (2004). Housing first, consumer choice and harm reduction for homeless individuals with a dual diagnosis. American Journal of Public Health, 94, 4, p. 651-656. Consumers choose the neighborhoods they want to live in, how their apartments are furnished, and all other decisions regarding the use of their new homes. Consumers also determine the frequency, duration, and intensity of the support and treatment services they receive. Consumers feel secure knowing housing will be held for them during relapse, psychiatric crisis or short incarcerations. Most importantly though, consumers know they have a voice and often attend Tenant Advisory Council meetings, which provides a forum for input into the program and solicits ideas for changes to meet new needs.Pathways to Housing - Housing and Services Retrieved October 27, 2010. Using this consumer-driven approach, Pathways to Housing has achieved remarkable success in housing retention for its target population. In one federally funded longitudinal random assignment study, 80% of the participants assigned to Pathways to Housing were in stable housing after 12 months compared to 24% for the three-step Continuum of Care programs. Housing serves approximately 700 individuals living in supported scattered-site apartments throughout New York City; Westchester County, New York; the District of Columbia, Burlington, Vermont and Philadelphia.  History  In a widely cited article entitled Pathways to Housing, published in 2000, Tsemberis and Eisenberg reported on a study undertaken from 1993 to 1997 examining the effectiveness of a five-year (1993-1997) Pathways to Housing supported housing program on 242 clients with severe psychiatric disabilities and addictions in New York City. During that time Pathways to Housing provided \\"immediate access to independent scatter-site apartments for individuals with psychiatric disabilities who were homeless and living on the street.\\" With an 88 percent retention rate, the \\"supported housing program achieved better housing tenure than did the comparison group.\\" By 2007 Pathways to Housing had an annual operating budget of $15M and was funded by grants from city, state and federal government, individual contributions, foundation grants and corporate support. By 2012 Pathways to Housing had successfully housed over 3,000 people with 85-90% retention since 2002. In 2010, Pathways to Housing set up a mobile video exhibit at nine locations in New York City where there were over 36,000 homeless people in 2009.\\"NYC Homeless Counts\\", New York City Department of Homeless Services, 2009. The exhibit featured an image of a homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk in downtown Manhattan projected on to a building. Words also projected asked passersby to send a text message to help get him off the streets. A text message sent triggered a new video loop in which the man gets up and walks in the door of his new apartment. The idea is to convey visually the organization‚Äôs approach to combatting homelessness, which emphasizes getting people who are homeless into housing first and then tackling issues like mental health and addiction.\\"Video Installation Encourages Homeless Activism In New York City\\", Huffington Post, March 9, 2010.Memmott, Mark. \\"High-Tech Street Show Aims To Make Us 'See' Homeless, Raise Money\\", National Public Radio, March 10, 2010.Wallace, Nicole. \\"Using Light Display to Raise Awareness and Money\\", Chronicle of Philanthropy, March 10, 2010.

Pathways to Housing Canada describes the Housing First as a \\"client-driven strategy that provides immediate access to an apartment without requiring initial participation in psychiatric treatment or treatment for sobriety.\\" In Economic Action Plan 2013, the Federal Government of Canada proposed $119 million annually from March 2014 until March 2019‚Äîwith $600 million in new funding‚Äîto renew its Homelessness Partnering Strategy (HPS).

Mining operations spanned 1866 to 1957, producing high grade silver, lead, and zinc ore. Some ore was smelted on site, but larger capacity smelters were eventually constructed along the shore of nearby Owens Lake. These smelting operations were the beginnings of the towns of Swansea and Keeler. Most of the metal ingots produced here were transported to Los Angeles, but transportation difficulties hindered the success of the mines. Mining of silver and lead peaked in the early 1880s, with a second mining boom producing zinc in the 1910s. History Discovery of the silver ore is credited to Pablo Flores, who began mining and smelting operations near the summit of Buena Vista Peak in 1865. Increasing white migration to the area was met with resistance from the Native Americans, which limited early mining efforts. The establishment of Fort Independence allowed for the expulsion of native populations, facilitating the expansion of the mining town. These early miners employed relatively primitive techniques of open pits and trenches and used adobe ovens to smelt the ore. Businessman Victor Beaudry (younger brother of Los Angeles Mayor and developer Prudent Beaudry) of nearby Independence, California, became impressed by the quality of silver mined at Cerro Gordo and opened a store nearby. He soon acquired several mining claims to settle unpaid debts and proceeded to have two modern smelters built. Beaudry continued acquiring mining rights from debtors until he soon owned a majority of the richest and most productive mines in the area, including partial interest in the Union Mine. In 1868, Mortimer Belshaw arrived in Cerro Gordo (Fat Hill), attracted by the rich deposits of galena ore. After establishing a partnership with another stakeholder in the Union Mine, he brought the first wagon load of silver from Cerro Gordo to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles he was able to secure financing to build his own smelter that was superior to all other smelters at Cerro Gordo, as well as to build the first wagon road up the mountain. This road became known as the Yellow Road from the color of the rock that it had been cut through. By operating the Yellow Road as a toll road, Belshaw was able to earn income and control the shipments of silver from the mountain. =Tourism= Cerro Gordo is privately owned as a ghost town and tourist attraction, accessed by special permission. It has several vintage buildings, including the general store. The town was advertised for sale in June 2018 and sold the following month to Los Angeles entrepreneurs, who planned to keep it open for tourism with historical preservation. The buyers, Brent Underwood and business partner Jon Bier, purchased the property with additional investment from a collection of Los Angeles-based creatives. The American Hotel, an icehouse, and a residence were destroyed in a fire on June 15, 2020. Underwood is still committed to the restoration project.  Buildings The American Hotel was built in 1871 by John Simpson, and was the oldest standing hotel in California on the east side of the Sierras. Early in the morning of June 15, 2020, fire destroyed the hotel and a neighboring building. The owners plan to build a replica. The Belshaw House was built around 1868 by Mortimer Belshaw, developer of the Belshaw Blast Furnace. The Gordon House was built in 1909 by Louis D. Gordon, who began the \\"zinc era\\" of Cerro Gordo. In media Remi Nadeau, a descendant of the family involved with the transport of ingots from Cerro Gordo across Owens Lake and by mule train to Los Angeles, has written books and articles on the period. * The Water Seekers (1950) * \\"Los Angeles: from mission to modern city\\" (1960) * Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of California (1965) Cerro Gordo, the Belshaw House, and the Inya Mine are featured in the season 19 episode of Ghost Adventures titled \\"Cerro Gordo Ghost Town\\", which aired in 2019 on the Travel Channel.

Early life Born Earl Gerald Piche in Toronto to Betty Piche, a homemaker, and Earl Piche, a soldier with The Algonquin Regiment in the Canadian Army, he was raised by his mother and step-father, William \\"Bill\\" McRae, after his father, Earl Piche, was killed overseas during the war in 1945. He was soon given his step- father's last name of McRae. McRae came from a family of war veterans, as his own father and uncle were both killed in action during World War II, while his grandfathers, as well as step-father Bill McRae, were all decorated war veterans. This would inspire McRae to devote much of his time to veterans causes and affairs, later earning him The Friendship Award, the highest civilian honour, from The Royal Canadian Legion. With Bill McRae being in the Royal Canadian Air Force during peacetime, McRae was a so-called army brat, moving around with his family every few years. Career After a brief encounter with university, at 19 years of age, McRae dropped out and instead began work at the now-defunct Ottawa Journal as a writer covering the teenage music scene in Ottawa. He later worked at the Cornwall Standard-Freeholder and then the Peterborough Examiner as a general assignment reporter. It was during his time at the Cornwall paper in November 1963 when McRae experienced the arguably most-defining and shocking news story of the 20th century: the Assassination of John F. Kennedy: \\"When President Kennedy was assassinated I was eating a B.C. Delicious apple at my desk in the newsroom of the Cornwall Standard-Freeholder. The single teletype machine suddenly began chattering, its bulletin bell ringing, and news editor Paul Cragg ran back to check and shouted: \\"Oh my God -- Kennedy's been shot in Dallas!\\" I know exactly what I was wearing. I can see, hear, and feel it all as if it happened this morning. Those of us who went through it will never, ever forget where we were and what we were doing around 1 p.m. on Nov. 22, 1963. I phoned as many friends and family members as I could, and in the cold rain of that dark, late November afternoon, I walked back to my rooming house, crying.\\"- McRae remembering November 22, 1963[\\"Where were you on that fateful day?\\" by Earl McRae, Ottawa Sun, http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/P/Presley_Elvis/1977/08/16/748822.html] McRae later worked at the Toronto Star, where he covered major news events such as the Apollo 11 moon landing and The Beatles playing at Maple Leaf Gardens, the latter of which, he ambushed the \\"fab four\\" for an interview as they were leaving the back entrance of the King Edward Hotel in Toronto. No other journalists were around, having all waited at the front of the hotel. With stints writing for Maclean's magazine, McRae became the sports editor of the Canadian Magazine, a Saturday publication that came with the Toronto Star in the 1970s and early 1980s. It was during this time that McRae wrote some of the most acclaimed sports profiles in journalism, from his piece on retired NHL enforcer Reggie Fleming to former CFL great Hal Patterson, the best of these profiles being made into two sports anthologies, The Victors and The Vanquished and A Requiem for Reggie. It was McRae's penetrating and insightful profiles on the world's most famous athletes that gave the Canadian Magazine a wide readership and clout during its hey-day. After working at the magazine, McRae wrote for Quest magazine in Toronto, the most notable piece being a no- holds-barred lengthy profile on retired NHL player Bobby Orr and his life after hockey. Titled \\"Poor Bobby\\", it has been widely studied by journalism students for its biting honesty, eloquent prose and for McRae's steadfastness in remaining an impartial writer while covering a beloved public figure. As writer Stephen Brunt said in his 2006 unauthorized biography Searching for Bobby Orr, McRae's piece on Orr \\"became a genre exercise. A story about trying to pin down a star who refuses to be interviewed, the narrative tracing the futile chase, the pursuit itself taking the place of the traditional biographical sketch.\\"\\"Searching for Bobby Orr\\" by Stephen Brunt, page 279. McRae was also a successful, albeit controversial, broadcaster in Toronto, hosting his own sports shows on CJCL, CILQ-FM and CBC TV. His zany humour and sharp honesty sparked the ire of Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard due to McRae's repeated criticism of Ballard's ownership of the NHL team, with Ballard threatening to pull CJCL's broadcasting rights to the Leafs games due to McRae's commentary. McRae remained at the station and a staple of sports journalism in Toronto. Aside from his sportscaster career, McRae wrote award- winning film biographies on Sugar Ray Leonard, Joe Montana, and marathoners Bill Rodgers and Alberto Salazar. After other writing and sportscasting stints in Toronto, in 1986 McRae was hired by the Ottawa Citizen to be its sports columnist, a position he held for six years, before his move to the Ottawa Sun. It was at the Citizen where McRae became a fixture in the city's sports scene. Like in Toronto, McRae became known for his brutally honest pieces on sports events, as well as his talented writing, which made him a popular local figure in the city. During this time, he also hosted a sports show on CKQB-FM (54 Rock). In 1992, McRae began working as a daily interest columnist at the new daily publication, the Ottawa Sun, where he would remain until his death. It was here that McRae spent the longest term of his career, writing for the paper for almost 20 years and becoming the publication's most notable writer, the Ottawa Sun being synonymous with McRae until his death in 2011. During his time at the paper, McRae's columns (for a time called McRae's World) were highly-read, keeping him as one of the city's, and nation's, most popular writers. His columns varied between introspective, sentimental pieces to quirky and controversial, where he covered everything from international events, like the funeral of Princess Diana to the local Ottawa scene. Writing a daily interest column allowed McRae to branch outside the sports world, an opportunity he loved, and cover anything that sparked an interest in him. He continued to do telling sports profile pieces, such as ones on NHL goaltenders Tom Barrasso and Ray Emery but also focused on local issues; investigative pieces, heart-warming stories, revealing columns on political scandals and articles petitioning for a change, McRae's columns had as much sway with the public as any politician's agenda; in 1996 he was accused by then CFL commissioner Larry Smith of being partially responsible for the folding of the Ottawa Rough Riders due to several critical columns he wrote on the franchise's shaky ownership. It was McRae's columns on Canadian businessman and Ottawa philanthropist Howard Darwin, urging the City of Ottawa to honour the late Darwin with a permanent memorial, that spearheaded the process of renaming Merivale Arena to Howard Darwin Centennial Arena. Canadian Olympic figure skater Barbara Ann Scott was indebted to a column by McRae for having her memorabilia displayed at Ottawa's city hall as well. Notably, he predicted in a 2008 column that Barack Obama would be assassinated by right wing groups while campaigning for the presidency. McRae founded the Elvis Sighting Society in Ottawa in 1989, a non-profit registered charity that through its fund- raising events has currently raised upwards of $750,000 for various Ottawa- area charities. Awards McRae won the gold at the Canadian National Magazine Awards for sports journalism three times, the top honour in its field, plus two silvers, and was nominated eight times. He won three Ontario Newspaper Association awards for his columns. He was runner-up finalist in 2006 for the National Newspaper Award in sports writing for his piece on former heavyweight boxer George Chuvalo. He won 10 column-writing Dunlop Awards for the Sun Media chain. In 2010, McRae was inducted into Algonquin College's Media And Design Hall Of Fame (Journalism) for lifetime achievement. In 2002, McRae was awarded the Friendship Medal, the highest civilian honour by the Royal Canadian Legion, for his articles on matters pertaining to the military, not the least of which was his column-writing campaign over several weeks that raised some $250,000 from the public to make it possible for a large group of Canadian veterans to return to Ortona, Italy in 1998 for a reunion ceremony. In 2007, McRae won the Canadian Consumers' Choice Man of the Year honour in a Leger Marketing poll of consumers in the Ottawa-Gatineau area. Death On the early evening of October 15, 2011, McRae died of a massive heart attack he sustained while in the Ottawa Sun newsroom. He had just returned from covering the funeral of a local cyclist who had been struck and killed by a motorist and McRae was set to write a lengthy feature piece on the tragedy. He collapsed shortly after arriving to the newsroom. Paramedics were called to the scene and rushed McRae to the hospital but doctors were unable to revive him. He was 69 years old. Legacy Earl McRae is widely regarded as one of the greatest sports journalists in Canadian history, with veteran sports writer Stan Fischler calling his Requiem for Reggie piece, \\"The best hockey story ever written.\\"[\\"Requiem for Reggie\\" by Earl McRae, re- printed in the Toronto Sun, July 15, 2009.http://www.torontosun.com/sports/columnists/2009/07/14/10133181.html] TSN broadcaster Bob McKenzie credited McRae as his inspiration for becoming a sports journalist, saying \\"I remember waiting for the Saturday Star to show up so I could read him.

The work, written in the form of a historical account, describes an imagined Russian and French landing at Hong Kong's Deep Water Bay, followed by shelling of Victoria Peak, a sea battle in the Sulphur Channel between Hong Kong Island and Green Island, and a last stand at Stonecutters Island in which British forces were decisively defeated. The story was intended as a criticism of the lack of British funding for the defence of Hong Kong; fears of invasion were driven by French expansionism in Southeast Asia and increasing Russian influence in Manchuria. It was speculated, but never proven, that members of the Imperial Japanese Army read the book in preparation for the 1941 Battle of Hong Kong, in which Japanese forces overran Hong Kong (via the New Territories, rather than Hong Kong Island) in just 18 days. In terms of its style, it follows the model laid out by George Tomkyns Chesney's The Battle of Dorking, but is noteworthy for its attention to detail, even giving real names of individual soldiers and ships; one reviewer described it as \\"unique\\" in its verisimilitude, stating that only William Le Queux's The Invasion of 1910 and Cleveland Moffett's The Conquest of America could compare to it. The Back Door received renewed attention in October 2001, when it was republished by Hong Kong University Press under the title Hong Kong Invaded! A '97 Nightmare. The republished edition, at 328 pages in length, was accompanied by a variety of scholarly discussion; the actual text of The Back Door itself occupied barely one-sixth of the book's length. The title of the republished edition was intended as a form of misdirection and a joke to the reader, evoking fears over the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. Bickley was criticised by one reviewer for the cartoon-like illustrations included with the book, and the fact that she had spent so much time on historical analysis of what was described as a \\"mediocre piece\\" of fiction.

They were founded as early as the 13th century as charitable and religious organizations for the laity. These institutions had a capital role in the history and development of music. Inside these Scuole were born at the beginning of 16th century the first groups of bowed instrument players named \\"Violoni\\". Membership and responsibilities Unlike the trade guilds or the numerous scuole piccole, the Scuole Grandi included persons of many occupations, although citizenship was required. Unlike the rigidly aristocratic Venetian governmental Great Council of Venice, which for centuries only admitted a restricted number of noble families, membership in the Scuole Grandi was open to all citizens, and did not permit nobles to gain director roles. Citizens could include persons in the third generation of residency in the island republic, or persons who had paid taxes in Venice for fifteen years. The Scuole Grandi proved to be one of the few outlets for non-noble Venetian citizens to control powerful institutions. Their activities grew to encompass the organization of processions, sponsoring festivities, distribution of money, food and clothing to poorer members, provision of dowries to daughters, burial of paupers, and the supervision of hospitals. During the Middle Age, each school had its own regulation, named capitulare or mariegola. Their authonomy was lost during the Renaissance when the institutions were subjected to a specific Magistracy that ruled the office of the leaders and oversaw the drafting of Capitulars After a process of secularization, charities lost their Christian identity and were absorbed into the Venetian structure of the State, that encompassed an exhibiting unity-order among the social classes of the Repubblic, as it is depicted in the Procession in St. Mark's Square (Gentile Bellini, 1496). While Venice deleted the Middle Age ius commune from its hierarchy of the sources of law, Grandi Scuole were divided into two opposite classes, and started to securitize their immobiliar investments under the central direction of private banks, even if within the bounds of their history redistribution rules. The Poverty Laws approved in 1528-29 entrusted from the State to the Grandi Scuole system all the charitable and social activities, like: handouts, drugs, burials of needy persons, hospices for widows and children, food and lodging for pilgrims, brotherhood for prisoners. The Serenissima kept for itself a residual role in social justice, uniquely related to those forms of poverty that may become a negative element for the new order of the aristocratic Republic. Structure and physical layout The Scuole Grandi were regulated by the Procurators of Venice, who set forth a complex balance of elected offices, mirroring the structures of the republic. Paying members could vote in the larger Capitolo, which in turn elected 16 members to a supervisory Banca: a chief officer, Vicario (first deputy), Guardian da Mattin (director of processions), a scribe and twelve officers known as the Degani (two for each sestiere). A second board, known as the Zonta was meant to examine the accounts of the Banca. Typically the main building consisted of an androne, or meeting hall for the provision of charity; the upper floor contained the salone used for meeting of the Capitolo and a smaller room, the albergo, used for meetings of the Banca and Zonta. They often had an affiliated hospital and church. The Scuola often sheltered relics, commissioned famous works of art, or patronized musicians and composers. List of Scuole Grandi By 1552, there were six Scuole Grandi: *Scuola Grande della Carit√† (founded 1260) now part of the Gallerie dell'Accademia *Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista (founded 1261) *Scuola vecchia della Misericordia (founded 1308) *Scuola Grande di San Marco (founded 1260) *Scuola Grande di San Rocco (founded late 15th century) *Scuola Grande di San Teodoro (founded 1530 or 1552) The Scuola Grande dei Carmini was the last of its kind to be recognized as a Scuola Grande in 1767 by the Council of Ten.

In the course of the plot, the creatures study the nature of air (which they call \\"the void\\"), liquids, and gravity from their limited perspective.

Brief history A grant from the Sloan Foundation was awarded to the Pan-American Association for Physics to establish the National Society of Hispanic Physicists (NSHP). The Founding Meeting of the Society was held in Austin at the University of Texas in April, 1996 and the first annual meeting was held in Houston, Texas in October 1997. The US-Mexico Workshop on Teaching Introductory Physics, the first major project undertaken by the Society, was held later that year in Monterrey, Mexico. The project was a bilingual joint venture between the NSHP and the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) to explore the goals of the introductory physics sequence and recent pedagogical developments to meet those goals. The Hispanic Physicist, the official newsletter of the NSHP, has been in publication since 1997. The NSHP meets jointly with other societies organizing sessions, hosting social functions, promoting discussions of diversity and inclusion issues in the physics community, and recognizing achievements of Hispanic-American physics students and faculty. The National Society of Hispanic Physicists has met annually with the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) since 1997 and twice with the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) (in Austin, TX in 2003 and Albuquerque, NM in 2005). In addition, the NSHP has met at sectional meetings of the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Astronomical Society (AAS). More recently the Society has met annually with the National Society of Black Physicists. The organization was incorporated under the umbrella of the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) in August 2014.EurekAlert! American Association for the Advancement of Science Mission and Goals The purpose of this society is to promote the professional well-being and recognize the accomplishments of Hispanic physicists within the scientific community of the United States and within society at large. The Society seeks to develop and support efforts to increase opportunities for Hispanics in physics and to increase the number of practicing Hispanic physicists, particularly by encouraging Hispanic students to enter a career in physics. ... from the Constitution of the National Society of Hispanic Physicists, 1997 The Society pursues its mission through four very broad activities. 1) Promoting the study of physics among Hispanic students. This includes encouraging and mentoring students where appropriate, developing resources for undergraduate study, research, and participation in the scientific community. 2) Identifying and heralding the accomplishments of Hispanic physics faculty and students in research, teaching, study, mentoring, and outreach. 3) Providing a forum through which Hispanic faculty and students can come together and celebrate not just the pursuit, and passion, of science but also sharing a rich and vibrant culture. 4) Working with the larger physics community as teachers, faculty, administrators, and societies work to transform the physics community into a more inclusive and diversified one. This work includes joining with other societies, developing resources, and highlighting effective practices and programs.

Sami assists EJ, but he then declines to help Lucas and states that the only thing that would persuade him to delay his escape is if Sami has sex with him, explaining that one of his missions in Salem is to \\"plant the DiMera seed\\" in a Brady of his choosing.(2006, December 29). Days of Our Lives. [Television series]. NBC: New York. Sami agrees to EJ's bargain. EJ reciprocates by shifting the beam off Lucas before leaving. EJ later returns to Salem to clear his name and resume his former life. Sami visits him at the police station to assure him that she's kept their secret. EJ is cleared of all charges due to insufficient evidence and released. He hires Sami's then-boyfriend, Lucas, to work for his company. Sami realizes that she is pregnant and that she doesn't know who has fathered her baby - EJ or Lucas. EJ eventually figures out that Sami is pregnant and demands an amniocentesis to determine the paternity of the baby. Sami presents EJ with fake test results, which name Lucas as the father. EJ is disappointed, but he still feels that they have a connection. Familiar with Sami's history of tampering with paternity tests, he breaks into the hospital lab and finds out that the test was not performed. EJ apologizes on several occasions and refers to what he did as vile and inhuman. He uses the word \\"rape\\" in one of his apologies. He does everything he can to earn back Sami's trust and saves her life on several occasions. Meanwhile, Sami, Lucas, and EJ find out that she's carrying twins. Later, EJ and Sami scheme together, and it seems as though EJ is being redeemed. Sami is shown to trust him a little bit more than she did before, although she does not forgive him for what he did. The origin of the DiMera vendetta against the Brady family, said to have begun with a forbidden affair between Santo DiMera and Colleen Brady, who look exactly like EJ and Sami, begins to reveal itself. Once the terms for ending the DiMera vendetta are revealed, and that EJ and Sami must marry, EJ reminds Sami of what is at stake if they don't marry. When Sami decides not to go through with the terms, EJ points out that her family is in danger. Sami calls EJ to come to the pub and, again, discuss their possible marriage and her annulment from Lucas. While EJ is with Sami at the pub, Sami's stepfather, John, is killed in a hit-and-run. Sami assumes that John was killed because of her decision not to marry EJ. Sami agrees to divorce Lucas and marry EJ. On October 23, 2007, Sami gives birth to her twins at her mother, Marlena Evans' house and agrees to have a new DNA test done on the twins. While the test is being performed, Sami leaves for Santo Domingo to divorce Lucas and leaves the twins with Steve Johnson and Kayla Brady. EJ learns, before Sami, that he is the father of the boy, John Roman. After Sami and Lucas return from Santo Domingo, EJ stops by Sami and Lucas' apartment and explains that he has made arrangements to marry Sami the following night. Sami protests but eventually agrees. On November 8, 2007, Sami and EJ are married. As Father Kelly pronounces them \\"husband and wife\\", three gunshots are heard. EJ is struck in the back by one of the bullets and cannot feel his legs. Sami holds vigil at the hospital with Stefano. Later, Stefano tells EJ that he is paralyzed and they don't know if it is permanent. EJ is devastated. Sami arrives at the hospital in time to witness EJ crying in Stefano's arms.

Sami and EJ decide to move in together to prove to the immigrations officer that they are a loving family so that EJ will be able to stay in the country. Though it comes to light that this was an elaborate ruse orchestrated by EJ to maintain the status quo with Sami and the children, EJ is extremely moved to overhear Sami tell the imposter immigration officer that he would be lucky if he found someone who \\"loves him half as much as EJ loves me\\". During this time, EJ, law degree in hand and with a renewed interest in turning over a new leaf, joins Mickey Horton's firm. He takes on his first case, despite John and Sami's objections, representing Sami's longtime rival, Nicole Walker. On May 15, 2008, EJ and Sami hash out their feelings over what happened the night Johnny was conceived. Sami declared that it is time that the slate between them is wiped clean. EJ asks Sami if she can really put the night of Johnny's conception behind them, and Sami says yes. After their conversation is interrupted by a tipsy Nicole barging into the mansion and demanding to see EJ, Sami pulls EJ into a kiss. This leads to the couple making love on May 18. Due to a misunderstanding, Lucas is released from prison early and, despite having told Sami that she should move on, is livid when he discovers her in bed with EJ. Sami and EJ's marriage is annulled, but not before EJ begs Sami to be honest and admit that she has feelings for him. She tearfully admits that she does. EJ tries to move on with Nicole, but it is clear from the start that his feelings for Sami.

Sami attempts to tell EJ about her pregnancy on October 17. While standing on the DiMera mansion's doorstep, Sami spies EJ and Nicole together through the window. Moments later, she witnesses Salem's mayor being assassinated. Following the assassination, EJ rescues Sami from a sniper, after which she agrees to go into the Witness Protection program.

EJ, however, slips pictures of Johnny and Allie into her luggage. Sami and EJ, despite being separated, still show signs of longing for each other. =2009‚Äì10= After having a miscarriage, Nicole, having discovered that Sami is carrying EJ's child, fakes the third trimester of her pregnancy by wearing a rubber baby belly to hold onto EJ. She makes a deal with Mia, a pregnant teenage girl, to take the infant once it's born and raise it as her own. Nicole decides to switch Mia's baby with Sami's. The baby switch is a success, with Sami bringing home baby Grace Rafaela, and Nicole bringing EJ and Sami's daughter back to the mansion, naming her Sydney Anne DiMera. Sami is now involved with Rafe Hernandez, the FBI agent assigned to protect her. Grace is rushed to the hospital, and on June 9, she dies from complications of meningitis. Sami, devastated by the death of the baby she believed was her biological daughter, lashes out at EJ, coming clean about hiding the pregnancy from him. Eventually, tensions ease between the two with the help of a guilt-stricken Nicole. Sami shows remorse for her actions, and EJ reveals to Lexie that he still has feelings for Sami. EJ asks Sami to visit Grace's grave with him. Sami shares her pregnancy story and apologizes to EJ about not telling him about Grace, asking for forgiveness. After they comfort each other at Grace's graveside, EJ leaves Sami, giving her a kiss on the cheek.

When Nicole is granted bail after being arrested, she kidnaps Sydney and goes on the run. However, she's intercepted by Anna DiMera, EJ's sister-in- law, who kidnaps Sydney from her. It's later revealed that Anna was hired by EJ to kidnap Sydney. However, he brings her back, looking like the hero to Sami. Sami and EJ grow closer over the summer of 2010. EJ proposes to Sami on July 30, and she accepts his proposal. Throughout the summer, EJ goes to great lengths to keep the secret behind Sydney's kidnapping hidden from Sami.

She pulls a gun out of his hand and shoots him in the head with it. EJ recovers, shocking everyone by breathing on his own after he is taken off life support. On October 14, EJ admits to Stefano that he still loves Sami, and that he believes that if she shot him, he got what he deserved. Eventually, though, EJ sets out to prove that Sami was the shooter, as it becomes clear to him that it's the only way that he will ever be able to see his children again. Rafe's sister, Arianna, gets a recording of Sami confessing to the shooting, but before she can bring it to EJ, she is killed by a hit-and-run driver. The recording ends up with her fianc√©, Brady Black, and found by Nicole, who blackmails Rafe and Sami with it so she can spend more time with Sydney. However, she later brings it to EJ, asking for time with Sydney in return. EJ brings the recording to Sami and blackmails her into giving up Johnny and Sydney on the day she marries Rafe. However, when Johnny is diagnosed with eye cancer and has to have an eye removed, EJ lets Sami be there and decides to let her be a part of the children's lives again. =2011‚Äì12= After Johnny's surgery, EJ notices that he is very attached to Rafe. He asks for Stefano's help in getting rid of that. When Rafe ends up unconscious after a car accident, he and Stefano switch him out with a surgically altered imposter to ruin Sami's marriage and get Rafe out of his children's lives. Sami attributes the changes in Rafe's behavior to the car accident. Meanwhile, EJ marries Nicole again but realizes that he's also fallen in love with her sister, Taylor.

EJ has decided to leave Nicole for Taylor, but Nicole blackmails him with the fact that she knows what EJ and Stefano did to Rafe. EJ proposes to Taylor, but before things go any further, Stefano and EJ are both exposed, and arrested for the imprisonment of Rafe, as well the murder of Fay Walker. Taylor finds out about EJ's involvement in her mother's death, breaks up with him and mends her relationship with Nicole.

After weeks of Sami plotting against EJ, EJ begins to make progress with reconciling with her. One of the major steps he takes is turning in additional evidence against his father, Stefano to Rafe, which would protect Sami and the children by preventing Stefano from returning to Salem. Sami confesses to EJ that she still loves him and they reconcile. Shortly thereafter, EJ tells Sami he is the luckiest man alive. EJ meets with new arrival and rival drug lord Clyde Weston at a private business meeting in the woods. EJ and Clyde have an argument and EJ punches Clyde. EJ's bodyguard Miguel shoots EJ.

Reception EJ and Sami's relationship has been recognized as a top couple to view by Sympatico/MSN/TV Guide. The pairing won Best Couple in Soap Opera Digest's Hot Off The Net poll, published the week of September 17, 2007, and their portrayers won the Best Actor and Best Actress honors in the same poll the week of September 10, 2007. In a September 10, 2007 Soap Opera Weekly interview with Bryan Dattilo, portrayer of Days of our Lives' Lucas Roberts, the popularity and appeal of the EJ and Sami storyline was discussed. The interviewer stated that Soap Opera Weekly receives more fan mail from EJ and Sami fans than from Lucas and Sami fans. When asked if he would be okay if Sami and EJ became a supercouple, Dattilo responded, \\"Yeah. I think Sami and EJ have the ability to be a supercouple like Luke and Laura.\\" EJ and Sami's popularity has proved formidable to rival couple Lucas and Sami. There is debate among viewers over whether or not what EJ did to Sami in the December 29, 2006 episode (see above) could be considered rape. In a May 3, 2007 interview, actor James Scott, portrayer of EJ, was interviewed by Sympatico/MSN/TV Guide about the subject: > I don't think they handled the rape very well, and I'll tell you why. EJ > raped Sami, and then afterwards, he's hanging out in her house ‚Äî alone with > her. It's irresponsible on so many levels. However, had it been handled > well, I think it would have been an interesting story choice. Now the story > focus has shifted to her pregnancy and the classic soap story of paternity. > Having said that, I chose to believe that EJ is in love with Samantha ‚Äî he > just can't communicate it. In an article about the Santo DiMera/Colleen Brady storyline in the July 17, 2007 edition of Soap Opera Digest, Days of our Lives former Co-Executive Producer Stephen Wyman referred to the December 29, 2006 incident between EJ and Sami as rape. \\"Naturally, we don't expect anyone to forget about the rape, nor do we expect anyone to take EJ's rape of Sami lightly. However, we know life goes on. People can change,\\" he said. \\"At some point, the issue of the rape is going to have to be dealt with in the fundamental way, but meanwhile, there is the audience that wants to see EJ and Sami together. [But] they aren't forgetting about the rape, either.\\" The article is about the Santo/Colleen storyline, in which the actors, Alison Sweeney and James Scott, portray two characters from the past falling in love. Soap Opera Digest noted, \\"this story provides an opportunity for the actors to work together romantically in a less controversial tale.\\" In June 2007, Soap Opera Weekly printed an opinion column that addressed concerns that rape is being portrayed as romantic on soap operas. The author opined that soap operas such as General Hospital, Guiding Light and Days of our Lives (citing EJ and Sami) are portraying rape as romantic because these soap operas are seen to be pairing or considering to pair a female character with a character who raped her or with a character some viewers believe raped her. \\"Sorry folks. If daytime's most famous couple [Luke and Laura from General Hospital] cannot escape the horror of the campus disco after 28 years, how could GL's and Days' non- couples hope to gloss over sexual assaults that aired just recently? Do the soaps think audiences can forgive and forget so quickly?\\" stated the author. She added that the \\"chemistry is a great thing\\", but that she did not believe it was enough to overcome the controversial scenes, even though a \\"unique formula\\" gave Luke and Laura a \\"free pass\\" to allow them to become one of the most popular supercouples on daytime television.

Schack is at center, his hands held by soprano Josepha Hofer and baritone/impresario Emanuel Schikaneder. Click on image for the identities of the other players and the original source. Benedikt Emanuel Schack () (7 February 175810 December 1826) was a composer and tenor of the Classical era, a close friend of Mozart and the first performer of the role of Tamino in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute.  Early life  Benedikt Schack (also spelled as ≈Ω√°k, Ziak, Cziak or Schak) was born on 7 February 1758 in Mirotice, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic, then part of the Habsburg monarchy). Like Joseph and Michael Haydn, he worked as a chorister as a child, singing from 1773 in the cathedral in Prague,Grove Dictionary then moved to Vienna (1775) to study medicine, philosophy and singing. His voice teacher in Vienna was , a tenor who performed under Joseph Haydn.Heartz (2007, 272) From 1780, Schack worked for several years as Kapellmeister to Prince Heinrich von Sch√∂naich-Carolath in Silesia. In 1786, Schack joined the traveling theatrical troupe of Emanuel Schikaneder, working both as a tenor and as a composer of Singspiele. The troupe settled in Vienna in 1789, performing in the suburban Theater auf der Wieden.  Friendship and collaborations with Mozart  It was around this time that Schack became a friend and professional colleague of Mozart, who was gradually increasing his involvement with Schikaneder's troupe. Schack apparently asked his friend for advice and help in composing,The source here is the preface to an 1831 edition of Schack's A Mass for Four Voices and Orchestral Accompaniments published by Vincent Novello. Novello had learned of Mozart's assistance from the Mozart's widow Constanze during a trip to Salzburg in 1829 (Buch 1997, 195). and the level of assistance evidently increased. The following anecdote was published in the Baierisches Musik-Lexikon by (Munich, 1811): > Mozart often came to Schack to fetch him for a stroll; while Schack dressed > he would sit at the writing desk and compose here and there a piece in > Schack's operas. Thus several passages in Schack's operas derive from > Mozart's own hand and genius.Quoted from Buch (1997, 195). Buch adds: > \\"Lipowsky was not a part of the Viennese circle, so this account probably > comes from Schack himself, who was working in Munich at the time.\\" A later > letter from Constanze Mozart, quoted below, also supports the story. In 1790, Schack and his fellow singer-composers of the Schikaneder troupe collaborated to write an opera Der Stein der Weisen (\\"The Philosopher's Stone\\"). Mozart also played a part in its composition, contributing a duet (\\"Nun liebes Weibchen,\\" K. 625/592a)\\"On Mozart's Partial Autograph of the Duet \\"Nun, liebes Weibchen\\", K.625/592a\\" by David J. Buch, in Journal of the Royal Musical Association, No. 124 (1999), pp. 53‚Äì85 (via academia.edu) and perhaps other passages.Buch 1997, 196 This fairy-tale opera can be considered a kind of precursor to The Magic Flute; it employed much the same cast in similar roles. When The Magic Flute (music by Mozart, libretto by Schikaneder) premiered in 1791, Schack took the role of Tamino. According to the New Grove, \\"it is to be presumed that he also played Tamino's flute solos\\", though other scholars disagree.The traditional view given by the Grove is not corroborated by any reliable source and is challenged by Albrecht (2005), who suggests that the flutist Anton Dreyssig played Tamino's flute music from the orchestra pit, with Schack miming his playing, as tenors generally do today. An 1815 source indicates that Schack sang the role a total of 116 times.The Baierisches Musik-Lexicon by Felix Joseph Lipowsky, cited in Deutsch 1965, 514 Only two months after the Magic Flute premiere, Mozart died. According to a story that first appeared in an anonymous obituary of Schack (1827), the two men participated in a rehearsal of Mozart's Requiem on the last day of Mozart's life.Deutsch (1965, 536‚Äì7). The obituary appeared in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, issue of July 25, 1827, and is likely to reflect a story told to the author by Schack himself. > On the very eve of his death, Mozart had the score of the Requiem brought to > his bed, and himself (it was two o'clock in the afternoon) sang the alto > part; Schack, the family friend, sang the soprano line, as he had always > previously done, Hofer, Mozart's brother-in-law, took the tenor, Gerl, later > a bass singer at the Mannheim Theater, the bass. They were at the first bars > of the Lacrimosa when Mozart began to weep bitterly, laid the score on one > side, and eleven hours later, at one o'clock in the morning (of 5 December > 1791, as is well known), departed this life. It is worth noting that the tale first appeared 36 years after Mozart's death. Mozart wrote a set of eight variations (K. 613) on Schack's aria \\"Ein Weib ist das herrlichste Ding\\" from the Singspiel Der dumme G√§rtner.  Later life  Later, Schack moved on to posts in Graz (1793) and Munich (1796). With the decline of his singing voice, he retired in 1813 and lived on a pension. He died in MunichGrove Dictionary on 10 December 1826. Toward the end of his life, Schack was sent a letter by the former Constanze Mozart, which attests to his friendship with Wolfgang. Constanze, who had remarried (1809) to Georg Nikolaus Nissen, was seeking information to include in her second husband's biography-in-progress of her first. She wrote, \\"I could think of absolutely no one who knew him better or to whom he was more devoted than you ... Of great and general interest will be what you can instance of Mozart's few compositions in your operas.\\" However, Schack died before he was able to reply to Constanze's letter. Schack was married to the former Elisabeth Weinhold, who was also a singer; she took the role of the Third Lady in the Magic Flute premiere.  Assessment  Testimony for Schack's abilities as a singer comes from Leopold Mozart, who heard his debut performance with the Schikaneder troupe while it was visiting Salzburg in 1786. Leopold described Schack in a letter Leopold wrote to his daughter Maria Anna (Nannerl), who was living in nearby St. Gilgen: > The new tenor hired by Schikaneder arrived yesterday. He sings excellently > well and has a beautiful voice, with an easy and flexible throat and a > beautiful method. For this reason another opera, La Frascatana, will be > given so that the public can hear him on next Wednesday ... This man truly > sings very beautifully.\\"Translation from Heartz (2007, 272). \\"Easy and > flexible throat\\" renders the German \\"leicht gel√§ufige Gurgel\\"; \\"good > technique\\" renders \\"sch√∂ne Methode\\". La Frascatana was an opera by Giovanni > Paisiello. Schack's collaborative opera Der Stein der Weisen has recently been revived, prompted by the discovery of an early manuscript copy, by Boston Baroque under Martin Pearlman; the work has received favorable reviews.See Bampton Classical Opera performed it in 2002.

Biography Nef øƒ´ came to the Ottoman capital of Istanbul sometime before the year 1606, when he is noted to have been working in the bureaucracy as the comptroller of mines (maden mukataacƒ±sƒ±). Nef'i attempted to gain the sultan's favor for his poetry, but was unsuccessful with Ahmet I (reigned 1603‚Äì1617) and Osman II (reigned 1618‚Äì1622). However, finally, Sultan Murad IV (reigned 1623‚Äì1640) recognized his skill and granted him a stipend. Because of his vicious literary attacks on government officials, he was executed by strangulation in 1635 at the request of kaymakam Bayram Pasha. p. 285 Story of his execution Turkish historian and journalist Mahmut Sami ≈ûim≈üek tells the following story about the execution of Nef'i: Nef'i's execution was decided due to his satirical verses on Grand Vizier Bayram Pasha. As Nef'i went to Topkapƒ± Palace to present his newly written satire book \\"Sih√¢m-ƒ± Kaz√¢\\" () to Sultan Murad IV, lightning struck the dome of the palace. The sultan ordered him away yelling \\"You evil! Take your book and get off so that we get rid of the arrows of misfortune\\". After leaving the sultan's audience, Nef'i asked the palace master () to mediate for his pardoning. The black master of African origin started to write an application to the grand vizier while Nef'i stood nearby and watched. A short while after, a drop of black ink fell onto the white paper, and Nef'i promptly commented in sarcasm \\"Sir, your blessed sweat dripped.\\" The palace master tore the paper in anger, and Nef'i was delivered to the executioner. He was courageous until the last moment as he said to his executioner \\"Go man, you slacker!\\" After he was strangled with an oiled rope in the woodshed of the palace, his corpse was thrown into the sea. The following verse became famous describing the event: Works Nef'i was strongly influenced by classical Persian poetry, but also developed the Turkish kaside form. In addition to odes, especially about Sultan Murad IV, Nef'i wrote sarcastic and often vitriolic verse about the failings of specific governmental officials. Another famous verse of poet is as following: Tahir efendi bana kelp demi≈ü/ ƒ∞ltifatƒ± bu s√∂zde zahirdir,/ Maliki mezhebim benim zira,/ ƒ∞tikadƒ±mca kelp tahirdir.

The Constitution of the United States does not require that any federal judges have any particular educational or career background, but the work of the Court involves complex questions of law ‚Äì ranging from constitutional law to administrative law to admiralty law ‚Äì and consequentially, a legal education has become a de facto prerequisite to appointment on the Supreme Court. Every person who has been nominated to the Court has been an attorney.Jeffrey A. Segal, Harold J. Spaeth, The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited (2002) p. 182. Before the advent of modern law schools in the United States, justices, like most attorneys of the time, completed their legal studies by \\"reading law\\" (studying under and acting as an apprentice to more experienced attorneys) rather than attending a formal program. The first Justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury, appointed to the Court in 1846. Woodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, the most prestigious law school in the United States in that day, prior to his admission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not earn a law degree. Woodbury's successor on the Court, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1832, and was appointed to the Court in 1851, was the first Justice to bear such a credential.Henry Julian Abraham, Justices, Presidents, and Senators: A History of the U.S. Supreme Court Appointments from Washington to Bush II (2007), p. 49. Associate Justice James F. Byrnes, whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to October 1942, was the last Justice without a law degree to be appointed; Stanley Forman Reed, who served on the Court from 1938 to 1957, was the last sitting Justice from such a background. In total, of the 114 Justices appointed to the Court, 49 have had law degrees, an additional 18 attended some law school but did not receive a degree, and 47 received their legal education without any law school attendance.

Announced in April 2007, it was the first CCT program to be launched in the United States or any other developed nation. Its initial phases were funded by a number of private partners including The Rockefeller Foundation, Robin Hood Foundation, the Open Society Institute, Starr Foundation, AIG, and Mayor Bloomberg's own Bloomberg Family Foundation.Opportunity NYC Press Release, New York: News from the Blue Room. NYC.gov, 18 June 2007 The program is being evaluated by MDRC, a nonprofit research firm, using a random assignment research design. Opportunity NYC is administered by Seedco, a nonprofit community development organization. The program ended on 31 August 2010. The program hoped to build on the successes of similar programs that had garnered international recognition in the developing world, namely the Bolsa Familia in Brazil and a similar program, known as Oportunidades in Mexico which is a 10-year-old aid initiative that has been credited with alleviating Mexico's direst poverty and makes demands on participants while offering small but meaningful cash rewards.Fam√≠lia: Changing the Lives of Millions in Brazil. The World Bank, Aug. 22 2007 The cash payments go to the family, almost always the mother or other female head of the household. Parents can receive from $40 to $100 a month if they keep up with responsibilities such as taking their children to the doctor or keeping them in school. The program has three components: an education, health and work component. The education component gave money for certain milestones, including $50/month for 95% high school attendance, $600 for each Regent exam passed by a high school student, and $25 per parent- teacher conference the parents attended.\\"Opportunity NYC.\\" Opportunity NYC. Web. 7 Apr. 2011. . The health component gave money for health related milestones, including $200 for each family member who received a non-emergency checkup from a doctor, and $200 upon completion of a pediatrician advised Early Intervention evaluation for a child under 30 months. The work component gives families $300 for someone working an average of 30 hours/week for 2 months, or between $300‚Äì$600 for completing an education or professional training course. The World Bank, considers that \\"Conditional cash transfers provide money directly to poor families via a 'social contract' with the beneficiaries ‚Äì for example, sending children to school regularly or bringing them to health centers.

Those on the right applaud the system because it relies on individual initiative and acts as an investment in the future: Children in the program are healthier, they stay in school longer and they grow up with a better chance to become productive citizens. Those on the left say the program helps stabilize troubled families and gives poor children more consistent access to society's benefits.McMAHON, Colin. NYC program will try to buy good parenting.

A Preliminary Look at Early Educational Results of the Opportunity NYC ‚Äì Family Rewards Program A Research Note for Funders. Rep. MDRC, 2009. Print. The data shows that the program, in terms of overall poverty, created the greatest improvement in reducing the share of families living in severe poverty from 30% to 17%, and increased the likelihood that parents had bank accounts. In terms of education, positive results were most seen in high school and less in elementary and middle school students. The program group was shown to have an increased likelihood of passing at least two Regents exams by 6%, and increased the likelihood of having a 95% or better attendance by 15%.Riccio, James. \\"Sharing Lessons from the First Conditional Cash Transfer Program in the United States.\\" Policybrief22.pdf.

In 1935, during the Great Depression, Shadrach‚Äîat the age of 99‚Äîwalks the 600 miles from his home in Alabama to the Dabney farm in Virginia. His one request is to be buried in the soil of the farm where he was born into slavery. The farm is owned by the descendants of the Dabney family, consisting of Vernon (Keitel), Trixie (McDowell) and their seven children. But to bury a black man on that land is a violation of strict Virginia law, so the family goes through the arduous task of figuring out how to grant his request.

But without diminishing Shadrach's own determination and dignity (evoked in a minimalist, whispering performance by first-time actor Sawyer), it indulges in a certain sentimentality that is hard to accept in the dark weather stirred up by Beloved. The movie even has Vernon Dabney wonder if the slaves weren't better off back when they had an assured place in the social order and got their meals on time; the movie does not adopt this view as its own and quietly corrects him. But I was left with a vision of Vernon trying to expound his theories to Sethe, the heroine of Beloved, who would rather have a child dead in freedom than alive in slavery.\\" Also, unlike all the other reviewers, who gave Shadrach's age as 99, Ebert described him as \\"a 101-year-old former slave\\".Ebert, Roger.

Barnes was born in New York City. She married Charles Stelle Brown in 1880 and competed in the 1895 tournament as Mrs. Charles S. Brown representing Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. Shinnecock Hills at the time had club members named Barnes, and the United States Golf Association (USGA) speculates that Mrs. Brown was their daughter. The USGA had just been formed in late 1894, and earlier in 1895 had held the inaugural U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open. On November 9, 1895, they held the first U.S. Women's Amateur championship at the Meadow Brook Club in the Town of Hempstead, New York. The tournament that year was an 18-hole stroke play event (match play, used today, started the following year). Thirteen women competed, and Mrs. Brown won the tournament with a score of 132, defeating Nellie C. Sargent by two strokes. The score of 132 was the women's course record at the time. Mrs. Brown did not compete in the Women's Amateur again. Her husband, Charles S. Brown, founded a real estate company in 1873 which is still active today as Brown Harris Stevens LLC. One of their children, Archibald M. Brown, was later president of Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. The couple was still living in Manhattan in 1920.

These approaches have attracted significant interest and investigation recently in the context of speech enhancement, speech modeling, and speech classification research. The signal subspace is also used in radio direction finding using the MUSIC (algorithm). Essentially the methods represent the application of a principal components analysis (PCA) approach to ensembles of observed time-series obtained by sampling, for example sampling an audio signal. Such samples can be viewed as vectors in a high-dimensional vector space over the real numbers. PCA is used to identify a set of orthogonal basis vectors (basis signals) which capture as much as possible of the energy in the ensemble of observed samples. The vector space spanned by the basis vectors identified by the analysis is then the signal subspace. The underlying assumption is that information in speech signals is almost completely contained in a small linear subspace of the overall space of possible sample vectors, whereas additive noise is typically distributed through the larger space isotropically (for example when it is white noise). By projecting a sample on a signal subspace, that is, keeping only the component of the sample that is in the signal subspace defined by linear combinations of the first few most energized basis vectors, and throwing away the rest of the sample, which is in the remainder of the space orthogonal to this subspace, a certain amount of noise filtering is then obtained. Signal subspace noise-reduction can be compared to Wiener filter methods. There are two main differences: * The basis signals used in Wiener filtering are usually harmonic sine waves, into which a signal can be decomposed by Fourier transform. In contrast, the basis signals used to construct the signal subspace are identified empirically, and may for example be chirps, or particular characteristic shapes of transients after particular triggering events, rather than pure sinusoids. * The Wiener filter grades smoothly between linear components that are dominated by signal, and linear components that are dominated by noise. The noise components are filtered out, but not quite completely; the signal components are retained, but not quite completely; and there is a transition zone which is partly accepted. In contrast, the signal subspace approach represents a sharp cut-off: an orthogonal component either lies within the signal subspace, in which case it is 100% accepted, or orthogonal to it, in which case it is 100% rejected. This reduction in dimensionality, abstracting the signal into a much shorter vector, can be a particularly desired feature of the method. In the simplest case signal subspace methods assume white noise, but extensions of the approach to colored noise removal and the evaluation of the subspace-based speech enhancement for robust speech recognition have also been reported.

Ellen Page stars as the title character, an independent-minded teenager confronting an unplanned pregnancy and the subsequent events that put pressures of adult life onto her. Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney and J. K. Simmons also star. Filming spanned from early February to March 2007 in Vancouver, British Columbia. It premiered on September 8 at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, receiving a standing ovation. Juno won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and earned three other Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actress for Page. The film's soundtrack, featuring several songs performed by Kimya Dawson in various guises, was the first chart-topping soundtrack since Dreamgirls and Fox Searchlight's first number one soundtrack. Juno earned back its initial budget of $6.5 million in twenty days, the first nineteen of which were when the film was in limited release. It went on to earn $231 million worldwide. Juno received acclaim from critics, many of whom placed the film on their top ten lists for the year. It has received criticism and praise from members of both the anti-abortion and abortion rights communities regarding its treatment of abortion. In light of Georgia's anti- abortion law, Diablo Cody said she would not have written Juno now that people perceive it as an \\"anti-choice\\" film. Plot Sixteen-year-old Minnesota high-schooler Juno MacGuff, discovers she is pregnant by her friend and longtime admirer, Paulie Bleeker. She initially considers an abortion. Going to a local clinic run by a women's group, she encounters a schoolmate outside who is holding a one-person pro-life vigil. Once inside, however, a variety of factors lead Juno to leave. She decides to give the baby up for adoption instead. With the help of her friend Leah, Juno searches the ads in the Pennysaver and finds a couple she feels will provide a suitable home. She tells her father, Mac, and stepmother, Bren, who offer their support. With Mac, Juno meets the couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring, in their expensive home and agrees to a closed adoption. Juno visits Mark a few times, with whom she shares tastes in punk rock and horror films. Mark, who has set aside his rock band youth (now confined to memorabilia displayed in the one room of the house that Vanessa has designated for Mark's personal belongings), works at home composing commercial jingles. Juno and Leah happen to see Vanessa in a shopping mall being completely at ease with a child, and Juno encourages Vanessa to talk to her baby in the womb, where it kicks for her. As the pregnancy progresses, Juno struggles with the emotions she feels for the baby's father, Paulie, who is clearly in love with her. Juno maintains an outwardly indifferent attitude toward him, but when she learns he has asked another girl to the upcoming prom, she confronts him in a jealous rage. Paulie reminds Juno that it is at her request they remain distant and tells her she broke his heart. Not long before her baby is due, Juno is again visiting Mark when their interaction becomes emotional. Mark then tells her he will be leaving Vanessa to figure his life out. Juno is horrified by this revelation, with Mark asking Juno \\"How do you think of me?\\", revealing he is starting to develop feelings for her. Vanessa arrives home, and Mark tells her he does not feel ready to be a father and there are still things he wants to do first. Juno watches the Loring marriage fall apart, then drives away and breaks down in tears by the side of the road. Returning to the Lorings' home, she leaves a note and disappears as they answer the door. After a heartfelt discussion with her father, Juno accepts that she loves Paulie. Juno then tells Paulie she loves him, and Paulie's actions make it clear her feelings are very much reciprocated. Not long after, Juno goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital, where she gives birth to a baby boy. She had deliberately not told Paulie because of his track meet. Seeing her missing from the stands, Paulie rushes to the hospital, finds Juno has given birth to their son, and comforts Juno as she cries. Vanessa comes to the hospital, where she joyfully claims the newborn boy as a single adoptive mother. On the wall in the baby's new nursery, Vanessa has framed Juno's note, which reads: \\"Vanessa: If you're still in, I'm still in. ‚ÄîJuno.\\" The film ends in the summertime with Juno and Paulie playing guitar and singing together, in a happy relationship.  Cast  In addition, Rainn Wilson plays the convenience store clerk, Valerie Tian plays the pro-life protester and Emily Perkins plays the abortion clinic receptionist. Themes Along with Knocked Up and Waitress, two other 2007 films about women facing unplanned pregnancies, Juno was interpreted by some critics as having a pro-life theme. Ann Hulbert of Slate magazine believed that Juno \\"[undercut] both pro-life and pro-choice purism.\\" Jeff Dawson of The Sunday Times believed that the film was inevitably placed in the \\"unwanted pregnancy subgenre\\" with Knocked Up and Waitress due to its subject matter but thought that its interpretation as a pro-life film only \\"muddied the waters\\". Hadley Freeman of The Guardian criticized Juno for \\"complet[ing] a hat-trick of American comedies in the past 12 months that present abortion as unreasonable, or even unthinkable‚Äîa telling social sign\\", though she noted, \\"I don't believe any of these films is consciously designed to be anti-abortion propaganda.\\" A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, agreed that Juno has \\"an underlying theme, a message that is not anti-abortion but rather pro- adulthood.\\" Ellen Page commented, \\"What I get most frustrated at is when people call it a pro-life movie, which is just absurd ... The most important thing is the choice is there, and the film completely demonstrates that.\\" Cody and Page have openly stated that they are pro-choice; Reitman thought that it was \\"fantastic\\" that pro-life and pro-choice groups were embracing the film. He said that \\"Juno seems to be a mirror, and people [on both sides] see themselves in it.\\" Other critics labeled Juno as feminist because of its portrayal of Juno as a confident and intelligent teenage girl. Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe concluded \\"Juno serves cool, intelligent girls something they rarely see in a movie: themselves.\\" Cody said about writing the film, \\"Women are clever, women are funny, women are sharp, and I wanted to show that these girls were human and not the stereotypical teenage girls that we often see in the media\\" and \\"There was a lack of authentic teen girl characters ... I saw writing this screenplay as an opportunity to create an iconic female.\\" Page praised the film for its positive depiction of teenage girls, describing Juno's character as \\"really refreshing and allow[ing] for new possibilities in what young women can be\\" and \\"honest but original, completely devoid of stereotype\\", while also highlighting that \\"Girls haven't had that sort of character before. We don't have our Catcher in the Rye.\\" She criticized the media perception of her character as a \\"strong woman\\", arguing that if Juno were a male character, the \\"strength\\" of the character would not be considered remarkable. Reitman was interested in the personal/political conflict for Vanessa's character: \\"Feminism has paved the way for Vanessa's career, but ultimately Vanessa wants to be a full time mother.\\" Production =Development= Diablo Cody wrote the film based on many of her own high school experiences. Diablo Cody was first approached to write a screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir, Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper, after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on an adoption storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents, including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration in the story of a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah, and she used a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store in Crystal, Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself. Novick sent Cody's screenplay to his friend Jason Reitman; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script, he felt that if he did not direct the film, he would regret it for the rest of his life. Initially, Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script, because his first film, Thank You for Smoking, had not been released yet, so he did not have any feature film credits. Other directors, including Jon Poll, were considered, but Reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno. Cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing Juno (\\"I didn't ever think this film would be produced\\") and, indeed, the film was delayed by financial problems. After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios, John Malkovich's production company, Mr. Mudd, took on the project. It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co-producer Jim Miller. The funding originated from the United States. =Casting= Jason Reitman pictured Ellen Page as Juno when he first read the script. Having admired her performance in Hard Candy, Reitman cast Ellen Page in the lead role, saying that when he read the screenplay for the first time he pictured her as Juno. He visited her on the set of a film on which she was working to offer her the role. He also handed the script to J.K. Simmons, who had featured in his previous film, Thank You for Smoking, not telling him that he intended Simmons to play Mac. Simmons says that, after reading the script, he would have been happy to play even the high school teacher who has no speaking lines. Other cast members Reitman had \\"in mind right from the start\\" were Olivia Thirlby‚Äîwho had originally unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Juno‚Äîand Michael Cera. He took them with Page and Simmons to a Panavision stage in California and shot 45 pages of the script on 35mm film against a black backdrop. He presented this footage to Fox Searchlight as the initial cast. Reitman highlighted the importance of doing a screen test instead of individual auditions, saying: \\"This is a movie that's all about relationships and the idea of auditioning people outside of each other, one-on-one with the casting director, didn't make sense.\\" Jennifer Garner, who accepted a lower salary than usual to prevent the film from exceeding its budget, was confirmed by Reitman to have signed onto the project in January 2007. After working with Jason Bateman on The Kingdom, Garner recommended him to Reitman when they first met; Bateman was cast as Mark, the last cast member to be signed. Lucas McFadden, better known as Cut Chemist, a DJ and record producer, makes a cameo appearance as Juno and Paulie's chemistry teacher. McFadden was doing scoring work for Reitman when he received the Juno screenplay and asked McFadden to appear in the film; Reitman thought that it was \\"perfect irony\\" for the chemistry teacher to be played by Cut Chemist. Michael Cera stated that the film had \\"a lot of Canadian influence\\" due to the fact that he and Page were Canadian and that a lot of the other actors originated from Vancouver. Cera's comment was a response to a statement from Peter Howell of the Toronto Star: \\"I thought Juno was a very Canadian movie, even though it was set in the U.S.\\" =Filming= Eric Hamber Secondary School stood in for the fictional Dancing Elk High School. Shooting on a budget of US$6.5 million, Juno was filmed in and around Vancouver, British Columbia, standing in for Minnesota, where production was originally intended to take place. Although films commonly use a Canada-as-America location shift for budgetary reasons, Reitman insists the choice of filming location was instead at his request. Filming locations included a house in nearby White Rock as Mark and Vanessa's home, Eric Hamber Secondary School as Dancing Elk High School, and South Surrey's Athletic Park track as Dancing Elk High School's athletics track. After minimal rehearsal, filming took place in February and March 2007 on a six-week schedule, of which 30 days were designated to filming. The crew was planning to import snow for the film's winter events, but it snowed on location, and they were able to reschedule filming to shoot the winter scenes during snowfall, which second assistant director Josy Capkun says resulted in much wider snow shots than originally planned. Although the film was shot out of sequence, the final scene was scheduled for the final day and, after a long period of rain, the crew was intending to shut down production and resume months later to shoot the scene, set in summer, but the rain stopped and they were able to shoot the scene in the sun. That final scene depicted Juno and Paulie singing The Moldy Peaches' \\"Anyone Else but You\\", and band member Kimya Dawson visited the set to speak to Page and Cera while they were practicing the song. =Music= The movie features several songs performed by Kimya Dawson in her solo, Antsy Pants and The Moldy Peaches guises. This was due to a suggestion by Page. Director Jason Reitman explains: > At one point, I asked Ellen Page before we started shooting, '[W]hat do you > think Juno listens to?' And she said ['The Moldy Peaches.'] She went on my > computer, played the songs, and I fell in love with it. Diablo and I > discussed putting a Moldy Peaches song in it where the characters would sing > to each other. I got in touch with Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches[,] and > she started sending me her work, which was beautiful, and that became a lot > of the soundtrack. Kimya Dawson provided both solo songs and songs from two of her former bands. Reitman contacted Dawson, and, after reading the film's screenplay, she agreed for her songs to be used in the film, sending him a packet of CDs containing about 120 songs. The songs were almost entirely self-published by Dawson, who says she wrote nothing specifically for Juno and that all the songs had been performed and recorded before she was contacted to work on the film. Reitman asked her to additionally re-record instrumentals, which included humming over the lyrics of some of her songs. He also contacted composer Mateo Messina, with whom he had previously worked on Thank You for Smoking, to compose the film's incidental score. He gave Messina a collection of Dawson's songs and asked him to create \\"the sound of the film\\" through an instrumental score that replicated the recording quality, tone, feel and innocence of her music. Messina decided to implement an \\"acoustic guitar feel that was jangled and was really loose, like Juno.\\" Experimenting with different guitars, he ended up using \\"Stella,\\" a second-hand guitar belonging to guitarist Billy Katz that he described as \\"kind of tinny, not perfectly in tune, but [it] has all kinds of character.\\" Katz was hired to perform acoustic and classical guitar for the movie's score, using \\"Stella\\" extensively throughout. Page also suggested Cat Power's cover of the song \\"Sea of Love\\", which Reitman was hesitant to include as it had already been featured in the 1989 film Sea of Love; however, he decided that its inclusion would mark a \\"new take\\" on the film's cinematic references. Initially, Reitman had conceived of Juno being a fan of glam rock, but rejected it as too inauthentic, and he said he wanted to construct Juno to be \\"into music very real and authentic\\", making her a fan of punk rock, including The Runaways, Patti Smith and Iggy Pop and the Stooges. He felt that the Sonic Youth cover of \\"Superstar\\" defined Juno and Mark's relationship‚ÄîJuno preferring the classic 1971 version by The Carpenters while Mark preferred Sonic Youth's 1994 cover. \\"A Well Respected Man\\" by The Kinks was a song Reitman had associated with a character from another of his screenplays and says it was \\"heart-breaking\\" when he decided to include the song as an introduction for Paulie instead, despite feeling it suited the scene perfectly. He found children's songwriter Barry Louis Polisar's \\"All I Want Is You\\" after \\"surfing iTunes for hours on end\\" using different words and names as search terms and thought that the handmade quality was perfect for the opening titles, which were afterwards made to correspond to the song. The \\"Brunch Bowlz\\" jingle, Mark writes in the film, was composed by advertisement writer Chris Corley, with whom Reitman had previously worked on a set of commercials for Wal-Mart. =Design= The film was set out in a sequence of the year's seasons, which, Reitman said, \\"really resonated with me when I read it, because they mirror the three trimesters of Juno's pregnancy.\\" Because filming took place over only 30 days, fake flora were used to give the impression of different seasons while other flora were edited in post- production. Brown leaves were composited onto a fake tree outside Juno's house and cherry blossom trees outside Leah's house were touched up in a lighter shade of pink to depict autumn; a fan was used to blow leaves around in some scenes as if the leaves were falling from trees. Fake flowers were used in front of Paulie's house at the end of the film to give the impression of summer. Reitman used different colors to inform character, such as the burgundy and gold Dancing Elk High School track uniforms and an early scene with Juno in a red hooded jacket \\"walking through a world of somber greens and browns.\\" Cody was impressed with the production design team's creation of the set from only a few sentences in her script, calling Juno's bedroom \\"a very emotional set for [me] because it reminded me so much of my own little habitat when I was a teenager.\\" The walls of Juno's room are covered with posters of bands, while Leah's room includes a mural of older men she finds attractive and Paulie's room is overly childlike to indicate his innocence. Production designer Steve Saklad designed Mark and Vanessa's house with the assumption that \\"Vanessa has probably read every home magazine and tried to copy what's in them as best she could.\\" Costume designer Monique Prudhomme was nominated for a Costume Designers Guild Award in the \\"Excellence in Contemporary Costume Design for Film\\" category. She dressed Vanessa in clothes that were \\"simple and very tasteful\\" but with an \\"anal-retentive quality\\" and Mark in conservative clothing to complement Vanessa's taste. It was Page's suggestion that Juno wear flannel shirts and sweater-vests. Page also had to wear two sizes of prosthetic belly fitted like a corset in the back, a third \\"real\\" belly that is seen when Juno has an ultrasound, and a variety of sizes of fake breasts. The footage displayed on Juno's ultrasound monitor is of supervising sound designer Scott Sanders's son Matthew and was embedded into the scene in post-production. =Opening title sequence= 900 hand-cut images were composited onto a background to create the opening title sequence. Juno's opening title sequence, depicting a rotoscoped Juno walking through her town while drinking a bottle of SunnyD orange drink, was put together over 7‚Äì8 months by a small design studio, Shadowplay Studio, based in Los Angeles. Reitman had met the studio's co-founder Gareth Smith in Japan on the short film festival circuit where they each had shorts screening. Shadowplay created the opening title sequence for Reitman's previous film, Thank You for Smoking, and he contacted them again when he found out he was going to direct Juno. With vintage 1970s punk-rock posters as inspiration, Smith and artist Jenny Lee decided to create a sequence that \\"had texture and a little bit of edge, but also imparted the warmth and heart of the screenplay\\". In the last days of filming in Vancouver, Ellen Page was photographed with a high speed camera from a number of angles walking on a treadmill and drinking SunnyD. 900 still images of a walking and drinking Page were printed out and repeatedly run through a Xerox machine to degrade their quality until the pictures appeared hand-drawn. The pictures were cut out and scanned back onto the computer, then layered onto the background drawn by Lee with compositing software to create a stop motion animation sequence that corresponded to \\"All I Want Is You\\" by Barry Louis Polisar, the song Reitman had chosen. Shadowplay also designed the titlecards for each of the seasons for the film, hand-made a custom typeface for the opening title sequence and the closing credits, and collaborated on the design of the soundtrack and the DVD. Distribution =Theatrical release= With a well-received preview first screened on September 1, 2007 at the Telluride Film Festival, Juno premiered on September 8 at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival and received a standing ovation, which prompted film critic Roger Ebert to say \\"I don't know when I've heard a standing ovation so long, loud and warm.\\" It went on to feature at the Austin Film Festival, Rome Film Festival, London Film Festival, Bahamas International Film Festival, St. Louis International Film Festival, Stockholm International Film Festival, International Thessaloniki Film Festival, Gij√≥n International Film Festival, Palm Springs International Film Festival and the International Film Festival Rotterdam, earning awards and nominations at several. Although Juno was originally intended to open in theaters on December 15, 2007, it was moved forward to take advantage of the positive reviews and buzz preceding its release, and opened in limited release on December 5, playing in only seven theaters in Los Angeles and New York City. It opened in an additional thirteen cities and around 25 theaters on December 14, expanding further on December 21 before entering wide release on December 25. =Promotion= Hamburger phones were sent to critics to entice them to review the film. Anthony Breznican of the USA Today said in a 2008 article that Juno is one of three films that were \\"orchestrated to start off as word-of-mouth favorites among devoted moviegoers.\\"Breznican, Anthony. Box office: Modest films, niche marketing change landscape.\\" USA Today. February 22, 2008. Following Juno's release, Fox Searchlight sent hamburger phones styled similarly to that used by Juno in the film to journalists and critics to entice them to review the film. Though the phones were originally distributed in small numbers to viewers at promotional events, companies not affiliated with Fox Searchlight began to produce and sell the phones on eBay and other online stores. In the month after the film's release, sales of the phone on eBay increased by 759 percent and it was named one of the \\"10 Cool Gifts for Film Buffs\\" by Entertainment Weekly. =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray disc on April 15, 2008. It is available in a single disc DVD edition, which includes the movie along with an audio commentary by director Reitman and writer Cody, eleven deleted scenes, a gag reel, a 'gag take' (including a profanity laden blow-up by Rainn Wilson), a \\"Cast & Crew Jam\\", and screen tests. The two-disc DVD edition includes the same extra content and four additional featurettes (\\"Way Beyond 'Our' Maturity Level: Juno ‚Äì Leah ‚Äì Bleeker\\", \\"Diablo Cody Is Totally Boss\\", \\"Jason Reitman For Shizz\\", and \\"Honest To Blog! Creating Juno\\"), while the second disc is a DRM-encrypted version of the film for portable players. The Blu-ray version includes all the two-disc DVD edition extras and two additional featurettes: \\"Fox Movie Channel Presents: Juno World Premiere\\" and \\"Fox Movie Channel Presents: Casting Session\\". Reception =Box office performance= In limited release and playing in only seven theaters in Los Angeles and New York City, Juno grossed $420,113 over its debut weekend, averaging $60,016 per screen. When Juno became Fox Searchlight's first film to surpass $100 million at the box office, the company's president Peter Rice issued the statement: \\"This is an astonishing feat for us and the film has surpassed all our expectations. We knew this film had crossover potential and it has resonated with audiences all across the country.\\" The film has grossed $143,495,265 in the United States and $87,916,319 in other territories for a total worldwide gross of $231,411,584. It was also the highest-grossing of the five Best Picture nominees for the 80th Academy Awards. =Critical reaction= Juno received highly positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 94% approval rating from critics based on 215 reviews, with an average rating of 8.15/10. The site's consensus states, \\"One of the brightest, funniest comedies of the year, Juno's smart script and direction are matched by assured performances in a coming of age story with a 21st century twist.\\" making it the best reviewed comedy film on the website in 2007. On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 81 out of 100, based on 38 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars and called it \\"just about the best movie of the year. ... Has there been a better performance this year than Ellen Page's creation of Juno? I don't think so.\\" Ebert went on to place Juno at number one on his annual best of list. The film also ranks at number 463 in Empire magazine's 2008 list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. Juno MacGuff also ranked number 56 on Empire's list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time. Paste Magazine named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000‚Äì2009), ranking it at number 15. In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named Juno one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years. However, not all critics share the positive view towards Juno. David Edelstein of New York magazine felt that the film was desperate to be \\"a movie that confers hipness on teens, that makes kids want to use the same slang and snap up the soundtrack\\". Music reviewer Jim DeRogatis criticized the film's stylized dialogue and what he saw as a casual take on abortion and Juno's na√Øvet√© in becoming pregnant, claiming: \\"As an unapologetically old-school feminist, the father of a soon-to-be-teenage daughter, a reporter who regularly talks to actual teens as part of his beat and a plain old moviegoer, I hated, hated, hated this movie.\\" \\"The Juno Effect\\" In 2008, after 17 students under sixteen years of age at a Gloucester, Massachusetts, high school became pregnant, Time magazine called it the \\"Juno Effect\\".Kingsbury, Kathleen (June 18, 2008) \\"Pregnancy Boom at Gloucester High.\\" Time. Time stated that some adults dismissed the statistic as an outlier while others accused films such as Juno and Knocked Up for glamorizing teenage pregnancy. Kristelle Miller, an Adolescent Psychology Professor at University of Minnesota-Duluth stated that \\"[t]he Juno effect' is how media glamorizes pregnancy and how it's also ... pregnancy is also redemptive of any past problems\\". After Senator John McCain named Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate on the Republican presidential ticket, it was revealed in September 2008 that Gov. Palin's daughter, Bristol, age 17, was pregnant with the child of another teenager. News reports and editorials termed Bristol Palin's pregnancy as the latest episode in the debate over teen pregnancy of which Juno was a part, while conservative commentators made comparisons between Bristol Palin's pregnancy and the film. Noted New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier, \\"The Republicans wanted a new conversation, and they got one. Juno in Juneau!\\" Fox News' Roger Friedman wondered, \\"Juno at once violated and vindicated conservative values. The question is, will the public rally 'round Bristol Palin the way it did Juno? Or will it reject her for getting in this situation in the first place?\\" Juno actor Jason Bateman defended the film. \\"Unfortunately,\\" he said, \\"we've had these instances where guys kill people because of what they hear in rock 'n roll lyrics or some garbage like that. Look, if you're going to blame a movie or song for your actions, whether they be good or bad, I think you're looking at the wrong things to influence your life. I think people should look to other areas of their life for lessons and guidance, mainly parents, or teachers, or friends, or whomever. That should probably be where you should point your eyes and ears.\\" Amy Benfer of Salon.com wrote in 2010 that, according to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnancy rates for all teenagers dropped 2 percent between 2007 and 2008, meaning that \\"the slight uptick in teen pregnancy rates between 2005 and 2006 were probably just an anomaly and not some heinous trend brought about by pop culture\\", and that if there had been such a thing as a \\"Juno effect\\", it would have caused pregnancies to go down, not up. She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers \\"somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection\\" and that \\"by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies.\\" She concluded that \\"depicting teen parents may not glamorize them, so much as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too? So, now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting the lives of the tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won't necessarily contaminate the rest of them, it's time to stop worrying and ask what we can do to help.\\" =Top ten lists= The film appeared on critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007: *1st ‚Äì Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times *1st ‚Äì Paste magazine staff *2nd ‚Äì USCCB Office for Film and Broadcasting (tied with Bella) *3rd ‚Äì David Germain, Associated Press *3rd ‚Äì Moviefone staff *4th ‚Äì James Berardinelli, ReelViews *4th ‚Äì Lou Lumenick, New York Post *4th ‚Äì Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times *6th ‚Äì Claudia Puig, USA Today *6th ‚Äì Desson Thomson, The Washington Post *6th ‚Äì Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal *6th ‚Äì Liam Lacey and Rick Groen, The Globe and Mail *6th ‚Äì Marc Savlov, The Austin Chronicle *7th ‚Äì Corina Chocano, Los Angeles Times *7th ‚Äì Carrie Rickey, The Philadelphia Inquirer *10th ‚Äì A.

Reitman expressed disappointment that Juno was ruled ineligible for the Genie Award nominations: Sara Morton, the head of the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, issued a statement explaining that the film had never been submitted for Genie Award consideration by its studio. The Hollywood Reporter explained that Genie rules define Canadian films as financed at least in part by Canadian sources, and because American companies Mandate Pictures and Fox Searchlight were the sole funders, Juno was ineligible. Nonetheless, Genie spokesman Chris McDowall said that while the film was not evaluated for eligibility since it was not submitted, \\"Financing is one of the criteria, but it's not everything.\\" Despite this, the film was eligible for the 2008 Canadian Comedy Awards, receiving two wins from three nominations.

Under the Rhino Entertainment record label, it became the first number one soundtrack since the Dreamgirls soundtrack, 20th Century Fox's first number one soundtrack since the Titanic soundtrack, and Rhino's first number one album, topping the American Billboard 200 music charts in its fourth week of release. Rhino announced in March 2008 that Juno B-Sides: Almost Adopted Songs would be available through digital-only release, a second volume of songs that were considered for but not included in the film. The fifteen tracks include songs by previously featured artists Kimya Dawson, Barry Louis Polisar, Belle & Sebastian and Buddy Holly, as well as Astrud Gilberto, The Bristols, Jr. James & The Late Guitar, Trio Los Panchos, Yo La Tengo and Ellen Page singing \\"Zub Zub\\", written by Diablo Cody as part of the script in a deleted scene. Rhino also released a Deluxe Edition, on November 25, 2008, containing both the original soundtrack as well as B-Sides in a two-disc set, along with storyboards from the film and additional liner notes from Reitman.

Morice was the only son of Sir Nicholas Morice, 2nd Baronet and his wife Lady Catherine Herbert, the daughter of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke. He was educated at Salisbury School, and matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford on 24 August 1724, aged 17. In 1726 he succeeded his father to the baronetcy and Werrington. Morice was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Newport at the 1727 British general election. He was sometime Recorder of Launceston and at the 1734 British general election he was returned in a contest as MP for Launceston. He contributed to the election fund raised by the Cornish Tories in 1741 and was returned unopposed for Launceston at the 1741 British general election. He voted regularly with the Opposition with the exception of the vote on the Bossiney election petition in December that year when he voted with the Government. As an injured husband himself, he was persuaded in this case by Lord Abergavenny whose wife had been seduced by one of the opposition candidates, Richard Liddell. In 1744 Morice came into conflict with the Duke of Bedford over hunting rights near Werrington. He was returned unopposed again at the 1747 British general election. Bedford purchased an estate at Newport, and in 1748 began unsuccessfully to attack Morice in his boroughs. Morice married Lady Lucy Wharton, the daughter of Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton, in 1731. They were divorced in 1738 and he married secondly in 1741, Anna Bury, the daughter of Thomas Bury of Berrynarbor, Devon. He died on 17 January 1750 without issue and the baronetcy became extinct. Werrington was sold in 1775 to Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland.

History Recently, the caves have been occupied and used as temples or places to place cremation ashes. However since 10 years ago, the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act was promulgated, subsequently the Taitung County Government, East Coast National Scenic Area and Changbin Township Office had been trying to take over the caves. On 22 November 2017, they finally managed to take back the last cave and completed the reclamation of all 30 caves in the area. Geology Baxian Cave possesses a distinctive eroded look and is famous for ruins dating from the Old Stone Age. There are 10-plus caves on the high precipice, each of a different size and depth. Originally the caverns were below sea level, allowing waves to shape them, but now they are located on a high cliff‚Äîproof of the East Coast's changing surface.

It breeds in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela above or just below the treeline. It is entirely sedentary. Description Illustration by Joseph Smit This 30‚Äì32.5 cm long snipe has a stocky body and relatively short legs for a wader. Its upperparts, head and neck are streaked and patterned with dark brown and buff, and gold edges to the feathers form distinct lines down its back. The belly is white with brown barring on the flanks. The horn- coloured bill is very long and straight. The legs and feet are greyish-green. The sexes are similar, but females are longer billed; immature birds differ only in showing pale fringes on the wing coverts. The noble snipe has a clear melodious call. Andean snipe occurs within the range of noble snipe, but has broad wings, a barred belly and dark underparts. Migrant common and Magellan snipe are smaller, have more pointed wings and white trailing edged to the wings. Behaviour The noble snipe is found high altitude wet grassland marshes and swamps from 2,700 ‚Äì 4,200 m. Little is known of its biology, but it has an aerial display, which involves flying high in circles, followed by a powerful stoop during which the bird makes a drumming sound, caused by vibrations of modified outer tail feathers, lower pitched than that of common snipe. It breeds from March to July. The noble snipe is usually alone or in pairs, but is difficult to observe on the ground. It forages by pushing its long bill deep into the mud seeking insects and worms. Its cryptic plumage provides effective camouflage when the bird stands motionless amongst marsh vegetation.

Based upon his personal experiences, he argued that strenuous effort and overcoming hardship were ideals to be embraced by Americans for the betterment of the nation and the world in the 20th century. The speech Roosevelt states the main point of his speech in the opening remarks: An individual who puts great effort into his work and is not lazy, he claims, will be a success. It is the duty of someone who does not engage in manual labor for a living to devote himself to the arts or sciences. He uses the citizens of Chicago and Illinois as examples of people who embody such a spirit. Those who do not embrace the strenuous life, however, do not live meaningful lives. As the speech continues, Roosevelt claims that the strenuous life can benefit not just the individual, but also the entire country. He advocates imperialism as an extension of the strenuous life. America must become involved in global affairs, or else it will suffer as a nation. America must be a powerful country, and it must exert this power if it sees fit. Such strength necessarily requires a strong military, and a strong military presence. Roosevelt's concluding words tie together the importance of the strenuous life in the individual and the nation: The speech was published in 1900 as part of a collection of other Roosevelt writings and addresses also entitled The Strenuous Life.Roosevelt, Theodore. 1900. The Strenuous Life; Essays and Addresses Importance Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. The speech reflected his own personality and life experience. Roosevelt was sickly and asthmatic as a youngster, and had to sleep propped up in bed or slouching in a chair during much of his early childhood. He was in poor physical condition as a result. Roosevelt's father compelled the young Roosevelt to take up exercise, including boxing lessons in order to ward off bullies. The influence stuck. Upon graduating from Harvard University, Roosevelt underwent a physical examination and his doctor advised him that due to serious heart problems, he should find a desk job and avoid strenuous activity. Roosevelt disregarded the advice. As an adult, he exercised regularly and took up boxing, tennis, hiking, rowing, polo, and horseback riding. As governor of New York, he boxed with sparring partners several times a week, a practice he regularly continued as President until one blow detached his left retina, leaving him blind in that eye (a fact not made public until many years later). Thereafter, he practiced jujutsu and continued his habit of skinny-dipping in the Potomac River during winter.Thayer, Chapter XVII, pp. 22-24. As a result, the phrase \\"the strenuous life\\" has become highly connected to Roosevelt's life. Nathan Miller's biography of Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt: A Life, begins by saying that \\"the strenuous life\\" is one of \\"the things that immediately come to mind when Theodore Roosevelt's name is mentioned.\\" The speech also reflected the American spirit at the turn of the 20th century. The increasing industrialization and urbanization of America led many to become fearful of growing weak. College sports were on the rise, as were recreational athletics such as bicycling. American culture embraced masculinity, patriotism, and nationalism.Higham, John. Writing American History: Essays on Modern Scholarship. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1970. pp. 78‚Äì84. Issues of masculinity were especially predominant during this time, given the various women's movements of the age. Critics and scholars, including author Henry James, worried about a femininization of America. The time was ripe for Roosevelt to extol the masculine virtues of the strenuous life.Testi, Arnaldo. The Journal of American History. Volume 81, No. 4. (Mar., 1995), pp. 1521 Roosevelt used the speech to justify American imperialism as well.Burton, David H. Journal of the History of Ideas.

It is the sole remaining fighter base of that state and houses two squadrons of jet aircraft. Early years Graf Ignatievo is often called the German airfield by the Bulgarian aviation society, as the airfield was built with the extensive help of engineers from the Third Reich in the 1930s and was intended to house units of the Luftwaffe. In 1940, the airfield, when it became ready was turned over to the Bulgarian His Majesty's Air Troops. The first operational unit based here was the 2nd Army Aviation Regiment, comprising four yatos (squadrons): * Fighter yato, flying the Avia B.534 Dogan, Czechoslovak biplane fighters * Level bomber yato, flying the PZL.43 Chaika Polish light bombers * Reconnaissance yato, flying the Letov S.328 (Vrana) reconnaissance aircraft * Training yato, flying various training machines In 1943 the regiment was redesignated a ground attack regiment and in August the first of 12 Junkers Ju 87 R-2 dive bombers were delivered, followed from January to May 1944 by the more advanced Ju 87 D-5 (32 units), to form the regiment's 1st Orlyak. The 2nd Orlyak retained the B.534 fighters (21 units) with a secondary ground attack role. The formation relocated to Vrazhdebna airfield to take part in the war against the Third Reich. The Jet Age In 1945, the regiment converted to the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2/M3 and, in line with the Soviet air force organisational charts, transformed into a ground attack air division. For a short period, the 26th Independent Reconnaissance Air Regiment, flying the Petlyakov Pe-2, was also based at Graf Ignatievo airfield. In the beginning of 1951,the 15th, 19th and 21st fighter air regiments (FAR) were relocated to the airfield from Karlovo to form the 10th Fighter Air Division. Those were the descendants of the orlyaks of the former 6th Fighter Regiment of the His Majesty's Air Troops - their sole fighter formation, which took part in the defence of the capital of Sofia from Allied bombing in 1943 and 1944. At the time of the relocation to Graf Ignatievo, the regiments flew only a handful of Yakovlev Yak-11 and Polikarpov Po-2 training aircraft in preparation for the transition to jet aircraft - the Yak-23 and Yak-17. The first fighters started flying in April 1951. The batch comprised only 30 Yak-23s and 4 Yak-17Us, as the Bulgarian Air Force started acquiring the MiG-15 in September the same year. For that reason, the Yaks were transferred to the newly forming 1st Fighter Air Division in Tolbukhin (today Dobrich, northwestern Bulgaria). Lieutenant-Colonel Simeon Simeonov (a legendary figure in Bulgarian aviation history and future Commander of the Bulgarian Air Force) assumed command of 10th FAD. His monument is located in the front of 3rd Fighter Air Base - Graf Ignatievo's control tower. In April 1952, the 15th FAR relocated to Bezmer airfield, followed by the 21st FAR, moving to Uzundzhovo airfield. In May 1955, the 1st Squadron of the 19th FAR started flying the newly acquired MiG-17PF (12 units) with a radar targeting system. Those were the fighters involved in shooting down American spy balloons, deployed in great numbers over the country, downing seven of them. In the summer of 1957, a group of pilots, headed by squadron leader Captain Razsolkov, took an operational conversion course on the MiG-19. A batch of 40 MiG-19S arrived at Graf Ignatievo in September, re-equipping 2/19th FAR, 3/19th FAR and a squadron of 21st FAR at Uzundzhovo. In May 1959, an additional 12 MiG-19P relieved the MiG-17PFs of the 1/19th FAR, only to be exchanged for 12 MiG-19PMs a year later. In 1961, the 19th FAR became a unit of the newly formed 10th Composite Aviation Corps (after restructuring the 10th Fighter Air Division). In 1963, pilots of the 3/19th FAR underwent an operational conversion course on the MiG-21F-13 at the Soviet Air Force Operational Conversion Center in Krasnodar, and even during the course, the first batch of that new aircraft type was delivered in Graf Ignatievo. In 1969, the 2/19th FAR converted to the MiG-21M. In the 1970s, the air regiment comprised two squadrons, with the 1st Squadron flying MiG-19PM/S and 2nd Squadron flying the MiG-21M. The 3rd Squadron gave away its MiG-21F-13s to the units, based at Tolbukhin and Ravnets, upon its disbandment. 1978 saw the last MiG-19s being withdrawn from service and replaced by MiG-21MFs. The 2/19th FAR became nuclear strike-qualified, and a number of its pilots were specially trained for that task. In 1982, the air regiment took part in \\"Shield '82\\" - the year's major Warsaw Pact exercise, held in Bulgaria, as 18 MiG-21MFs were operationally deployed to Shtraklevo airfield and later to Bezmer airfield. In 1983, the unit converted to the MiG-21bis, acquiring 36 units, along with some twin-seaters. Modern days In 1990, the 21st FAR, at Uzundzhovo airfield, disbanded with its personnel and second-hand MiG-21bis forming the 19th FAR's 3rd Squadron, remaining at Uzundzhovo. In 1994, the 19th FAR also disbanded to form the 3rd Fighter Air Base (with the former 1/19, 2/19 and the ground aviation support units) at Graf Ignatievo airfield and the 4th Fighter Air Base (with the former 3/19 and the ground aviation support units) at Uzundzhovo airfield. When the 10th Combined Air Corps was transformed into the Tactical Aviation Command, the 3rd FAB went under the newly formed Air Defence Corps (successor of the 1st and 2nd Air Defence Divisions). When the 5th Fighter Air Base at Ravnets airfield was disbanded, the 1/3.FAB and 2/19.FAB were merged in order for Graf Ignatievo to house the \\"Sharks\\" squadron as the new 2/3.FAB. Today, the 3rd Fighter Air Base is Bulgaria's sole remaining air defence fighter base, taking part in and housing virtually every national and multi-national exercise, involving fighter aircraft. Future plans concern the merging of the 3rd Fighter Air Base at Graf Ignatievo airfield and the 22nd Ground Attack Air Base at Bezmer airfield in one air base in order for the 22nd GAAB to give way to future American military facilities.

It stood near the southwest corner of what are today the grounds of the Massachusetts State House. Description The Manor was built between 1734 and 1737 by Joshua Blanchard for the wealthy merchant Thomas Hancock (1703‚Äì1764). It was the first house to be erected on the top of Beacon Hill west of the summit and stood alone with no westward neighbor until around 1768, when the portrait painter John Singleton Copley built a house further down the slope.Bacon 1921. View of Hancock's house from across the Common, 1768 Thomas willed the property to his wife Lydia Henchman (1714‚Äì1776). She died childless, leaving it to her favorite nephew John. In its heyday it was considered the finest house in the entire Province of Massachusetts Bay and belonged to Boston's richest family. A three-story granite mansion, it overlooked the pastureland of Boston Common. It was surrounded by a family estate that included various outbuildings, gardens, orchards, fruit-tree nurseries, and pastures, and extended from today's Joy Street on the west to Park Street on the east and from Beacon Street on the south to near Derne Street on the north. The family farm went up the side of the then existing peak of Beacon Hill where the State House annex now stands. Slaves lived on the property. The Manor's brown stone walls were massive (the front was 56' in lengthDrake 1894, p. 5.), made of Quincy granite obtained from the surface, squared and well hammered. A balcony projected over the entrance door, upon which opened a large ornamental window. The balcony door was adorned with a cap that ended in baroque volutes. The corners and window openings were ornamented with Braintree stone, and the tiled gambrel deck roof featured a carved railing. Three dormer windows jutted out from the roof, which offered a beautiful, extensive view. The grounds were protected from the street by a low stone wall, on which was placed a light wooden fence with gateposts of the same material. A paved walk and a dozen granite steps with sandstone trim led to the mansion, situated at a little distanceThe Manor was a good distance further back from Beacon Street until it was widened. back from the street on ground elevated above it. The approach was then through a neat garden bordered with small trees and shrubbery. Before the broad front door (garnished with pillars and an ornamental door head) was a wide stone slab at the head of a flight of stone steps. A wooden hall, designed for festive occasions, sixty feet in length, was joined to the northern wing; this was moved to Allen Street in 1818. The east wing contained a great ballroom; the west was used for the kitchen and other domestic offices; beyond this lay the coach house and adjoining stable.Drake 1873, pp. 338‚Äì39.Bacon 1922, p. 39. The interior comprised a nobly paneled hall, having a broad staircase with carved and twisted balusters, which divided the house in the middle and extended through on both stories from front to rear. On the landing, partway up the staircase, was the circular-headed window that looked out upon the garden and the city, with a broad and capacious window seat. On the entrance floor, at the right of the hall, was the great dining room, 17' √ó 25', also elaborately paneled from floor to ceiling. Miss Eliza G. Gardner, who lived in the Manor for many years, described the interior and garden as follows: Revolution and Early Republic British soldiers pillaged the house about the time of the Battle of Lexington in April 1775; they also broke down and mutilated the fences for firewood, until a complaint by the selectmen caused General Gage to send Percy to occupy it. He remained there for some time during the Siege of Boston. That March, British officers had allegedly set an example to their men by hacking the fences with their swords, breaking windows, etc. A few days later Hancock was again disturbed by the redcoats, who refused to leave the premises at his request and mockingly told him his possessions would soon be theirs.Drake 1873, p. 340. The Hancock Manor became the headquarters of General Henry Clinton while he remained in Boston; he took command at Charlestown in September 1775. Both house and stables were in part occupied by the wounded from Bunker Hill. The house, however, remained relatively intact during the occupation, the furniture showing little signs of damage and the paintings none. It was in this center of Colonial society that Hancock entertained d'Estaing in 1778, Lafayette in 1781, George Washington in 1789, Jacques Pierre Brissot, and later Lords Stanley and Wortley, and Labouchi√®re and Bougainville.Drake 1873, pp. 340-41. Hancock himself continued to live in the Manor while Governor; indeed it was called the \\"seat of his Excellency the Governor\\" at the time. When d'Estaing visited, he was under a cloud for having deserted Colonial forces in Rhode Island, but the generous Hancock nevertheless entertained him hospitably. Some forty French officers dined daily at his table, and on one occasion the unusually high number of guests forced the servants to milk the cows on Boston Common (although these belonged to other owners). Brissot was astonished that Hancock was friends with Nathaniel Balch, a humorous hatter. It appears that the dying governor called Balch to his bedside and dictated to him the minutes of his will, in which he gave the Manor to the Massachusetts government. However, he died before his will could be properly drawn up.Drake 1873, p. 341. In 1795, two years after John Hancock's death, the town of Boston purchased most of the estate for ¬£4,000 and designated the pasture land as the site of the state's future capitol. Demolition and legacy The Hancock Manor, ca. 1860. The woman standing on the left of the balcony is identified as Elizabeth Lowell Hancock Moriarty, the great-grandniece of Governor John Hancock. Winter view of the Hancock Mansion, ca.1860 In 1859, Governor Nathaniel Banks proposed that the Commonwealth should purchase it for a governor's mansion, and the heirs offered it at a low valuation of $100,000. An influential joint committee of the Legislature reported favorably upon the measure, but it met with strong opposition from the rural districts and was defeated. A suggestion was also offered to make it a museum for the collection of Revolutionary relics. Though it had fallen into neglect, the house was excellently preserved: the interior woodwork was sound, the chamber of Lafayette remained as when he slept in it, the apartment in which Hancock died was intact; the audience hall was the same in which Washington, d'Estaing, Brissot, Percy, and many more had stood; the entrance hall, in which Hancock's body had lain in state for eight days, continued to open upon the broad staircase. It contained much of the furnishings and decorations of his time, with the family portraits by Copley and Smybert.Drake 1873, p. 342. State action failing, the land which it occupied was sold for $125,000 on February 18, 1863, during the Civil War. For some months it served as a museum of historical relics and efforts were made by the city to secure objects found inside the building. The heirs offered the mansion, with the pictures and some other objects of historical interest, as a free gift, with the intent of preserving it as a memento of Colonial and Revolutionary history. A scheme for its removal and re-erection elsewhere failed; the Legislature did not want to invest $12,000 to have the house transferred to another location. On June 16, 1863, at one o'clock, the Hancock Manor was sold at public auction and was purchased for $230. The terms of the sale were cash down and the purchaser, Willard Dalrymple, had ten days to have everything removed. The building was torn down despite public outcry and souvenirs of it were actively sought as it fell. The knocker on the front door was given to Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., a friend of the Hancock family, who placed it on his home in Cambridge, where it remained until it too was demolished. The flight of stone steps which led up to the entrance was purchased at the public auction and relocated to the outside of Pinebank Mansion in Jamaica Plain.Bacon 1922, p. 38. The mansion was demolished in 2007, but the steps were kept and refurbished the following year.Peter Shanley, \\"John Hancock‚Äôs stairs transcend Jamaica Pond\\", Jamaica Plain Gazette, January 18, 2013 Memorial plaque. The purchasers of the land, James Madison Beebe (No. 30) and Gardner Brewer (No. 29), two leading Boston merchants, erected a stately double brownstone house for their occupancy. Messrs. Ginn and Company publishers became established at No. 29 in 1901. For fifteen years their business offices fully occupied the spacious interior of the former Brewer residence which stood on the site of the Hancock Manor. In 1916 the marble extension of the Bulfinch Front of the State House to the west, and the taking of the surrounding grounds, necessitated the elimination of Hancock Avenue (a footway connecting Beacon and Mt. Vernon streets) and the removal of several of the houses, including 29 and 30 Beacon St. The Hancock Manor's demolition spurred a historic preservation movement that would help save buildings like the Old South Meeting House, the Old State House and the Hancock-Clarke House within the next few decades. An 18\\" x 21\\" bronze plaque, located on the iron wall below the State House's marble west wing, indicates the mansion's former location. It reads: \\"Here stood the residence of John Hancock, a prominent and patriotic Merchant of Boston, the first Signer of the Declaration of American Independence, and First Governor of Massachusetts, under the State Constitution\\". Hancock House, Ticonderoga, New York. A replica of the building, known as the Hancock House, was constructed in Ticonderoga, New York in 1926 from the original plans, for use as a museum; it is still in use, presently as the home of the Ticonderoga Historical Society.

This jurisdiction was initially established by Part XVI of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 and is now contained in Part XXII of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns hears challenges regarding the validity of federal elections (challenges regarding the validity of State elections are heard by the Supreme Court of that State as the State's Court of Disputed Returns). The jurisdiction is twofold: (1) on a petition to the Court by an individual with a relevant interest or by the Australian Electoral Commission, or (2) on a reference by either house of the Commonwealth Parliament. The Constitution A Court of Disputed Returns is a court, tribunal or some other body that determines disputes about elections in some common law countries, including the former Australian colonies. This jurisdiction of the courts evolved in England (and later in the United Kingdom), as a part of the struggle between the Crown and Parliament, and was largely settled in 1868 when the House of Commons gave the courts of common law jurisdiction to determine disputed returns. The Australian colonies enacted legislation based on the Parliamentary Elections Act 1868 (UK). At the constitutional conventions that led to federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, it was decided that election disputes would be determined by the courts, but the manner in which this was to be achieved was left to the new parliament.

Sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, the High Court declared the Senate election in Western Australia as void,. and ordered a special election. In 2017 there was series of parliamentary references to the Court of Disputed Returns, to determine the eligibility of a number of members of parliament found or alleged to be dual citizens, contrary to Constitution s 44(i). Procedure The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, which governs federal elections, provides the High Court with a jurisdiction as the federal Court of Disputed Returns. =Petition by individual or AEC= A candidate, or any person who had been qualified to vote in the election, may challenge the result,Similarly for a Senate replacement under Section 15 Constitution: . by a petition to the High Court as the Court of Disputed Returns. The petition must be filed within 40 days. Requisites of petition The Court can refer all or part of a matter to the Federal Court of Australia, but will itself determine questions of validity. The Court of Disputed Returns. A petition can also be filed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Petition by Electoral Commission The requirement that a person be entitled to vote at the specific election means that the Court of Disputed Returns does not have the jurisdiction to declare that the entirety of a general election was void. Any other person who was entitled to vote at the election may be heard in relation to the petition. 31.01 Appearances. The admissible grounds for a petition are whatever \\"the Court in its discretion thinks just and sufficient\\", but are specified to include \\"illegal practices ... committed in connexion with the election\\". \\"Illegal practices\\" are defined as actual or attempted \\"bribery and undue influence\\" by a successful candidate, who may then be criminally prosecuted; but, unless there is actual or attempted \\"bribery or corruption\\" by the candidate or with their knowledge and approval, the Court has to be \\"satisfied that the result of the election was likely to be affected, and that it is just that the candidate should be declared not to be duly elected or that the election should be declared void\\". Voiding election for illegal practices etc. Electoral officers' administrative errors will not matter unless they have affected the result. Immaterial errors not to vitiate election. See also ss 365A and 366. A complaint about being prevented from voting will require proof of the person's eligibility to vote and of their attempt to do so. The Court is empowered to compel production of documents and attendance of witnesses, and to examine witnesses on oath. Powers of Court However, the Court \\"must make its decision on a petition as quickly as is reasonable in the circumstances\\", Court must make its decision quickly it is not bound by strict rules of evidence, Real justice to be observed and all of its decisions \\"shall be final and conclusive and without appeal, and shall not be questioned in any way\\" Decisions to be final (thus there is no recourse to the High Court in its other capacities or to the Parliament). A decision of the Court of Disputed Returns may be made by a single judge, but an issue of constitutional interpretation is likely to be determined by the Full Court. The Court may dismiss or uphold a petition in whole or in part and, if upholding it, will declare: * that a person who was returned as elected was not duly elected, upon which that person will cease to be a member of the Parliament; or * that a candidate is duly elected who was not returned as elected, upon which that person may take their seat; or * that an election is absolutely void, in which case a new election is to be held. Effect of decision Costs will be as in ordinary proceedings in the High Court. The Court may order all or any costs to be paid by the Commonwealth or by \\"any unsuccessful party to the petition\\". Costs. The petitioner must lodge a returnable deposit of (only) $500 as security: Deposit as security for costs. =Parliamentary reference= In addition, there may be a reference by resolution of either house of the parliament on \\"[a]ny question respecting the qualifications of a Senator or of a Member of the House of Representatives or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament\\". Reference of question as to qualification or vacancy The reference (commonly termed a referral) is communicated to the Court by, as appropriate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President of the Senate.Media reports in 2017 that a member has \\"referred her/himself\\" are inaccurate; the member has requested (or acquiesced in) a motion for reference by the house in which they sit. There is no time limit, but in other respects the procedure is the same as with a petition, although the Court may also allow or request other persons to be heard. The Court is empowered to declare: :(a) that any person was not qualified to be a Senator or a Member of the House of Representatives; :(b) that any person was not capable of being chosen or of sitting as a Senator or a Member of the House of Representatives; and :(c) that there is a vacancy in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. Powers of court In practice, the references request the Court to determine how a vacancy so arising should be filled. The full Court may order a recount and appoint one member of the Court to supervise the process and confirm the result. Unlike an election petition there is no general right to be heard, a person must obtain leave of the Court. Parties to the reference. Thus in relation to the eligibility questions referred to the Court in 2017, in addition to the member of parliament and the Attorney General, only Tony Windsor , the unsuccessful candidate for New England, was given leave to appear. All other applications for leave were refused.. Early cases (1901‚Äì1949) The following cases were determined by the Court of Disputed Returns. It does not include numerous cases such as Sarina v O'Connor (1946) where the petition was withdrawn or dismissed by consent. =1903 Election= The first case heard by the Court of Disputed Returns was Chanter v Blackwood, in which John Chanter challenged the election of Robert Blackwood. The Court had to consider the validity of votes, and whether they had been properly accepted or rejected, and the extent to which disputed votes were proved to have affected the result of the election, by reference to section 200 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902. The High Court emphasised the extent to which errors or illegal practice may have affected the outcome of the election, with the effect that only close contests give rise to petitions. Further the costs involved mean that serious challenges to the election results are run only by the major parties. Maloney v McEacharn was a related case, in which William Maloney challenged the election of Sir Malcolm McEacharn. The main issue concerned the validity of postal votes that had not been signed in the presence of a Returning Officer or other specified person. The 300 invalid votes affected the outcome where the McEachern had a majority of only 77 votes.. Hirsch v Phillips was decided two days after Chanter v Blackwood, where Max Hirsch challenged the election of Pharez Phillips. The challenge was based on the fact that a polling booth at Ni Ni,A former village ~13 km from Nhill: was not open on the polling day. At the time electors were allocated to a polling booth and were expected to vote there, although they could vote at another polling booth if they made a declaration that they were the person enrolled to vote, that they had not voted elsewhere and promised not to vote at any other polling place. The polling booth at Ni Ni was opened one week later however voters registered at other polling places were not permitted to vote. Girffith CJ delivered the decision of the Court that a person who was absent on the original polling day was and remained entitled to vote at another polling place and there were no words to take that right away from them.. Having established the points of principle, the petition was heard by Griffiths CJ. Phillips majority was 167 and so Hirsch needed to bring evidence that at least 167 voters had been prevented from voting at Ni Ni to prove that their exclusion may have affected the result. Griffiths CJ dismissed the petition by consent. Cameron v Fysh concerned tchallenge by Norman Cameron against the election of Sir Philip Fysh with a majority of 31 votes. While Cameron alleged illegal practices, Griffith CJ held that there was no evidence that Fysh was responsible for any illegal practices, nor that undue influence affected enough votes to have affected the result of the election.. =1906 Election= Barton J held in Blundell v Vardon, that the election of Anti-Socialist Party candidate Joseph Vardon as the third senator for South Australia was void due to irregularities in the way the returning officers marked some votes. The Parliament of South Australia appointed James O'Loghlin. Vardon sought to have the High Court compel the Governor of South Australia to hold a supplementary election, however the High Court held in R v Governor of South Australia; Ex parte Vardon that it had no power to do so. Vardon then petitioned the Senate seeking to remove O'Loghlin and rather than decide the issue, the Senate referred the matter to the High Court. The Court held in Vardon v O'Loghlin that O'Loghlin had been invalidly appointed and ordered a supplementary election. Vardon and O'Loghlin both contested the supplementary election, with Vardon winning with 54% of the vote. Kennedy v Palmer, was a challenge by Thomas Kennedy against the election of Albert Palmer with a majority of 37 votes. Barton J held that the election was void due to irregularities in the way the returning officers marked some votes and Palmer won the by-election. =Crouch v Ozanne (1910)= Richard Crouch challenged the election of Alfred Ozanne. The first challenge was that Ozanne had attempted to bribe an elector by offering a silk dress if she voted for him. If bribery had been proven that would have been sufficient to void the election. O'Connor J held that the comment was merely a joke. In relation to the other challenges, O'Connor J held that while it was established that irregularities had occurred, these were insufficient to affect the result of the election where Ozanne had a majority of 1,645. =Hedges v Burchell (1913)= William Hedges challenged the election of Reginald Burchell, alleging that duplicate voting had taken place. Hedges sought to inspect the electoral rolls used at the election. Barton ACJ held the Court of Disputed Returns did not have the power to require the Chief Electoral Officer to produce the documents to be inspected by Hedges.The Court's power is now provided for in . See . =Kean v Kerby (1919) = John Kean challenged the election of Nationalist Edwin Kerby, who had defeated Labor's Charles McGrath by just 1 vote.John Kean was a scrutineer for the unsuccessful Labor candidate, Charles McGrath: Isaacs J held that there were a great number of official errors causing disfranchisement of electors. This included the \\"almost incredible carelessness\\" on the part of more than 20 local Presiding Officers who had certified that the voter had signed the declaration before him in circumstances where the voter had not signed the declaration at all. The election was declared void and McGrath defeated Kerby in a by-election. =Porter's telegram (1922)= John Porter, challenged the election of Harold Nelson for the newly created representative for the Northern Territory. People in the Northern Territory lost their ability to vote for a representative in 1911 when the Northern Territory was transferred from South Australia.. The Northern Territory Representation Act 1922, gave the Territory a representative, a position derisively referred to as a 'parliamentary eunuch', as the representative could speak but not vote in Parliament. Darwin was an isolated town, overland access was by a dirt track that was rutted and often impassable,An all-weather sealed road was not built until 1940: with no railway,Despite the Commonwealth's promise in 1911, the railway did not reach Alice Springs until 1929 and the Adelaide‚ÄìDarwin railway was not complete until 2003: nor airmail service.Airmail to Darwin commenced in 1934 as part of the Brisbane to England service: The Overland Telegraph was an important means of communication in the northern Territory, to the extent that it was reported that nominations of candidates could be made by telegraph. The grounds of the challenge were that (1) Asian and pacific islander people had voted without being naturalised Australians; (2) that ballot papers were inconsistently treated; (3) that an unqualified person had purported to witness postal votes; (5) that there was a reduced turnout in some subdivisions due to the wet season and the difficulty of obtaining qualified witnesses. Porter purported to lodge his petition by telegram. The High Court did not consider the grounds of the petition, holding there was no valid petition as a telegram was not an original document signed and attested to be true. =1928 Victorian Senate Election= The 1928 election was a half senate election in which 3 senators were to be elected for Victoria. 6 candidates were nominated, however Maj Gen John Forsyth died before the ballot. Most ballot papers were reprinted with just the 5 remaining candidates. The Labor how-to-vote card had Forsyth listed as No. 5 and more than 11,000 ballots had numbered the candidates 1, 2, 3, 4 & 6\\\\. The 2 unsuccessful Labor candidates, Albert Blakey and Edward Findley, challenged the election of Harry Lawson (Nationalist Party) and Robert Elliott (Country Party) on the grounds that these 11,000 votes had been rejected as informal. Starke J held that while the voters preferences were clear, the Electoral Act \\"absolutely and imperatively\\" required that a voter use consecutive numbers so that the votes were properly rejected as informal. =Perkins v Cusack (1929)= John Perkins challenged the election of John Cusack who had defeated Perkins, the sitting member, with a majority of 40 votes. Perkins alleged that (1) a parcel of 50 ballot papers had been tampered with, removing votes for Perkins and replacing them with votes for Cusack; and (2) people had been enrolled in Eden-Monaro despite their registered address being outside the division. Starke J held that the counting of the votes for Perkins had been an honest mistake and there was no evidence of vote tampering. The challenge to the addresses of voters was a challenge to the correctness of the electoral roll, and the Court of Disputed Returns was forbidden from considering the correctness of the roll. 1950‚Äì1999 =Crittenden v Anderson (1950)= Henry Crittenden challenged the 1949 election of Gordon Anderson on the grounds that (1) as a Roman Catholic, Anderson owed allegiance to the Vatican State and was therefore disqualified by section 44(i) of the Constitution and (2) the general advertising expenses incurred by the Labor Party exceeded the ¬£250 per candidate election expenses permitted. Fullagar J held the petition had no prospects of success and observed that the effect of the petition would be to impose a religious test for parliamentarians contrary to Section 116 of the Constitution.Crittenden v Anderson (Unreported, High Court (Fullagar J) 23 August 1950; noted in (1977) 51 ALJ 171. =Cole v Lacey (1965)= George Cole sought to challenge the 1964 Senate Election for Tasmania in which Bert Lacey was returned for the 5th and final seat. The petition alleged that the percentage of votes rejected during the scrutiny was considerably lower than that \\"in other States\\" and also \\"below that of informal votes in previous elections for the Senate in Tasmania\\". Taylor J held that it was \\"impossible to say that, having regard to the percentage of informal votes recorded at the election now in question, informal votes were admitted and counted or that it is probable that this occurred\\" and dismissed the petition.. =Re Webster (1975)= Senator James Webster who was a shareholder in and managing director of a company founded by his late grandfather. The company supplied timber and hardware, by public tender, to both the Postmaster-General's Department and the Department of Housing and Construction. The Senate referred the question of whether he was disqualified from sitting as having a pecuniary interest in an agreement with the Commonwealth to the Court of Disputed Returns. Barwick CJ considered the history of the section and its predecessors, describing it as a vestigial part of the constitution. In his view, it had been inserted not to \\"protect the public against fraudulent conduct of members of the House\\", but rather to protect the independence of the parliament against influence by the Crown. Barwick CJ took a narrow approach to the construction of section 44(v), concluding that a person was disqualified if \\"that person could conceivably be influenced by the Crown in relation to Parliamentary affairs.\\", para. [16]. =Berrill's challenges= Helen Berrill unsuccessfully challenged the results of three elections. The challenge to the 1975 Senate Election for South Australia was that large numbers of voters had been disenfranchised by having their names removed from the electoral roll.It was reported that Ms Berrill had changed her name by deed poll to \\"Stop Asian Immigration Now H-Berrill.\\" however this was not accepted by the Electoral Commission for inclusion on the roll: The Court followed its decision in Perkins v Cusack that it was forbidden from considering the correctness of the roll in determining a disputed election. Ms Berrill's challenge to the 1977 election for the seat of Boothby was dismissed because the petition did not plead the facts alleged to have constituted breaches of the Electoral Act.Re Berrill & the Poll for Electoral Division of Boothby (SA) (1978) 19 ALR 254; (1978) 52 359. Ms Berrill alleged that the entire 1983 Election was invalid because of irregularities in the electoral rolls. Mason J noted that the legislative policy that the Electoral Rolls were a conclusive record of the persons entitled to vote was \\"the product of the controversial and unsatisfactory history of Parliamentary review of disputed elections\\" and dismissed the petition.Berrill v Hughes (1984) 59 64. =Evans v Crichton-Browne (1981)= These were challenges to the 1980 election of three Liberal Party members, Noel Crichton-Browne as a senator for Western Australia, Sir William McMahon as the member for Lowe and Grant Chapman as the member for Kingston. The petition alleged that they had published misleading campaign material, including statements that \\"a vote for the Australian Democrats could be a vote for the Labor Party and could give the Labor Party control of the Senate\\" and that \\"the Labor Party was committed to the introduction of a wealth tax or capital gains tax\\" and that this misleading material was contrary to the Electoral Act.Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) s161(e). In a joint judgment the Court held at paragraph 13 that the section referred to \\"the act of recording or expressing the political judgment which the elector has made rather than to the formation of that judgment\\".. =Robert Wood (1987)= Robert Wood was elected as a Senator for NSW in 1987. The Call to Australia party's Elaine Nile challenged his election on 4 grounds: (1) that \\"His actions against the vessels of a friendly nation indicate allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power\\"; (2) Wood had served a term of imprisonment in 1972, (3) had been convicted of obstructing shipping in 1987; and (4) Wood was insolvent. The High Court, Brennan, Deane and Toohey JJ, dismissed the petition in December 1987 on technical grounds. The brief judgment made a number of observations about section 44 of the Constitution, relevantly including that the allegation of allegiance to a foreign power did not identify the foreign power nor identify any the acknowledgement of that allegiance. The Court observed that disqualification was not simply for the conviction of an offence: the offence must be punishable by imprisonment for one year or more. Similarly it was not enough to allege that Wood was insolvent; he had to have been adjudged to be an \\"undischarged insolvent\\".. The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 provided that a candidate must be an Australian citizen. Qualifications for nomination. and it was later discovered that Wood wasn't a citizen at the time of his election. The High Court unanimously held that he had never been validly elected. The High Court expressly declined to rule on the question of whether being a dual citizen would also disqualify a candidate from election.. =Sykes v Cleary (1992)= Phil Cleary won the 1992 by-election for the Victorian seat of Wills. Sykes claimed that Cleary, a permanent secondary school teacher in the Victorian public school system, was disqualified as the holder of an \\"office of profit under the Crown\\", contrary to Constitution s 44(iv), and that two other candidates were also disqualified since each was a citizen of a foreign power, contrary to Constitution s 44(i). A 6:1 majority of the High Court held in Sykes v Cleary that Cleary held an \\"office of profit under the Crown\\" as permanent employee of government. The other candidates had emigrated to Australia and become citizens. A 5:2 majority of the Court held that dual citizens are disqualified unless they have \\"taken reasonable steps\\" to renounce their foreign citizenship. Renunciation procedures had been available to the two candidates, but neither of them had taken any such step.. =1993 election= There was a flurry of activity in relation to the 1993 election, with petitions lodged, each of which were heard by a single judge and dismissed. Brennan J held that \\"the jurisdiction of the Court of Disputed Returns does not extend to the making of a declaration that the entirety of a general election is void\\". at [13]. Toohey J agreed. In two separate decisions, Dawson J also agreed. Ian Sykes had sought to challenge the entirety of the general election on the grounds that the candidate declaration contained a double negative, that the candidate was not incapable of being chosen. Dawson J held that even if the statement contained a double negative, it was not unclear or uncertain. The challenge to the election of Michael Lee was an allegation that Lee had misused his parliamentary postal allowance for party political business. Gaudron J held that the allegation was not a breach of the Electoral Act and so was not a ground on which an election could be declared to be invalid or void. at [12]. Alasdair Webster challenged the election of Maggie Deahm as the member for Macquarie by a margin of 105 votes. Webster made 22 allegations of irregularities, including widespread electoral fraud and that an advertisement mislead the voters that Deahm was a Democrat Candidate. Gaudron J dismissed all but 3 of the allegations, including a finding that the advertisement must be read as a whole.. The allegations that remained concerned allegations of multiple voting and personation. After the Electoral Commission had investigated the errors made in marking of the certified lists Webster accepted that the additional marks were explicable as scanning errors. Gaudron J dismissed the petition, ordering that the Electoral Commission bear its own costs because of its own errors, however Webster was required to pay the costs of Deahm. =1996 Election= Ross Free challenged the election of Jackie Kelly on the grounds that at the time of her nomination she was (1) a dual citizen of Australia and New Zealand and (2) a full-time officer of the RAAF. Brennan J declined to refer the matter to the Full Court to reconsider the correctness of the decision in Sykes v Cleary that a recount for a lower house seat \\"could result in a distortion of the voters' real intentions\\".. Kelly subsequently conceded that she was incapable of being chosen because she was a full-time officer of the RAAF,. a concession that meant the Court did not need to consider the question of her dual citizenship. There is some question as to the position of the RAAF as it can be comfortably read as part of the military forces, but it is harder to include it in the expression \\"navy or army\\". Blackshield has suggested that Kelly's concession may have been greater than was necessary. Kelly won the subsequent by-election with an increased margin. Warren Snowdon challenged the election of Nick Dondas on the grounds that certain provisional votes should have been counted rather than rejected. The issue concerned electors who changed address without notifying the AEC. The vast majority of voters were not disenfranchised if their new address was within the same electoral division. The exceptions were the divisions of Kalgoorlie and Northern Territory which were divided into sub-divisions due to their large geographic area. The AEC has said that the problem was acute in the Northern Territory because of its large and highly mobile aboriginal population. The Court held that the proper construction of the Electoral Act was that electors who moved to a different subdivision were not entitled to be reinstated to the electoral roll. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended \\"that the Electoral Act be amended to allow the reinstatement of provisional votes where an elector has moved between subdivisions in the Northern Territory or Kalgoorlie, but has remained within the relevant division.\\" The Electoral Act was subsequently amended to allow a person who changed sub-divisions to be reinstated to the roll. Item 181. The other unsuccessful petition was John Abbotto who challenged the Senate election in Victoria on the grounds that the \\"above the line\\" way of voting discriminated against ungrouped Senate candidates. Dawson J followed previous judgements that (1) the Court of Disputed Returns had no power to declare the entire half-Senate election to be void, and (2) that the above the line voting did not \\"so [offend] democratic principles as to render the sections beyond the power of the Parliament to enact\\". and the petition was eventually dismissed on 3 June 1997, more than 12 months after the election.. =1998 Election= Henry Sue and Terry Sharples challenged the 1998 Senate election for Queensland of Heather Hill on the grounds that she was incapable of being chosen as a senator under section 44(i) of the Constitution as she was a dual citizen of Australia and the United Kingdom and that the United Kingdom was a foreign power. The Court held in Sue v Hill,. that the United Kingdom no longer retained any legislative, executive or judicial influence over Australia and was therefore a foreign power. Ms Hill was therefore incapable of being chosen as a Senator. The other challenge to the 1998 Senate election for Queensland was the petition of Mr Ditchburn that the above the line voting system meant that the Senators were not \\"directly chosen by the people of the State\\" contrary to section 7 of the Constitution. This petition was dismissed by Hayne J.. Mr Ditchburn ran the same argument again in 2002 with the same result.. Hayne J dismissed a similar petition by Mr McLure in relation to the 1998 Senate election for Victoria.. Recent cases =Federal Court= Prior to 1998 the Electoral Act permitted matters to be referred to a State Supreme Court, however the High Court had never done so. The matter was considered by Brennan J in 1996 who held that the trial cannot be severed into parts, one part being determined by the High Court, the other part being determined by the Supreme Court.. The Electoral Act was then amended to provide that the Federal Court could determine part of the issue. Various matters have been referred to the Federal Court, however on each occasion the petition has been dismissed......... In 2009 a Full Court of the Federal Court confirmed that there is no appeal from a decision of the Federal Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns.. =2013 Senate Election for WA= The 2013 Senate election for Western Australia was close for the 5th and 6th Senate seats. The critical part of the count was which of 2 candidates should be excluded, referred to as the 50th exclusion point. The difference between the 2 candidates was 14 votes. After the original scrutiny and a fresh scrutiny the 5th seat went to Zhenya Wang and the 6th to Louise Pratt. Because the vote was so close the Electoral Commissioner had directed a re-court, during which it was discovered that 1,370 ballot papers had been misplaced. In the recount the 50th exclusion point went the other way with a margin of 12 votes, with the result that the 5th seat went to Wayne Dropulich and the 6th to Scott Ludlam. The Australian Electoral Commission petitioned the Court for a declaration that, because of the loss of the ballot papers, the election was void. The Court held that (1) the loss of the ballot papers meant that 1,370 electors had been prevented from voting, (2) the records of the earlier scrutinies could not be used by the court. The Court declared that Mr Dropulich and Senator Ludlam were not duly elected, but could not declare who was duly elected. The result was that election was declared void. A special election was held on 5 April 2014. =Re Culleton (2017)= Rod Culleton was declared elected as a Senator for WA following the 2016 federal election on 2 July, however questions were raised about his eligibility to sit as a senator. On 7 November 2016 the Senate referred that question to the Court of Disputed Returns and Culleton was subsequently found to be disqualified from sitting on 2 grounds of section 44 of the Constitution. The first was that on 23 December 2016 the Federal Court declared Culleton was bankrupt,. Culleton sought to challenge the capacity of the President of the Senate to advise the Governor of Western Australia that as a result of Culleton's bankruptcy his seat in the Senate was vacant however this was dismissed by Gageler J.. The second ground of disqualification was the decision of the Court of Disputed Returns that at the time of his election, Culleton, having been convicted, in his absence, of larceny, was \\"subject to be sentenced\\" for an offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer., =Re Day (2017)= Bob Day had been a senator since 1 July 2014. In 2016 his building company, Home Australia, went into liquidation. As Day had given personal guarantees to creditors, it was likely that he would be declared bankrupt and thus ineligible to keep his seat as a senator. Day resigned as a senator on 1 November 2016. There were questions concerning his eligibility to sit as a senator as a result of his interest in a property leased as his electorate office. On 8 November the Senate referred those questions to the Court of Disputed Returns. Questions of fact were determined at a trial before Gordon J.. The Full Court held that the financial benefit that Day obtained from the lease was an \\"indirect pecuniary interest\\" in an agreement with the Commonwealth. He was therefore incapable of sitting as a senator since at least 26 February 2016., =Dual citizenship eligibility questions= In July 2017 Senator Ludlam resigned as having dual Australian and New Zealand citizenship. 4 days later Senator Waters also resigned as result of having dual citizenship. In the following weeks questions about other members of Parliament were raised. On 8 August the Senate referred the question of the eligibility of Ludlam, Waters and Canavan to the Court of Disputed Returns. On 9 August Roberts was also referred. On 4 September MP Barnaby Joyce and senators Nash and Xenophon were also referred. The cases was heard by the Full Court over three days from 10 October, and the judgment handed down on 27 October 2017. In a joint judgment the High Court followed the reasoning of the majority in Sykes v Cleary. Having decided that the fact of citizenship was disqualifying, regardless of whether the person knew of the citizenship or took any voluntary act, it followed that each of Joyce, Ludlam, Nash, Roberts and Waters had been ineligible to be elected. Under Italian law Canavan was not a citizen of Italy and was therefore eligible to be elected.. Xenophon, as a British overseas citizen, did not have the right to enter or reside in the United Kingdom and so neither a citizen nor entitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen of the United Kingdom.

Raymond was born and studied in Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic), working later in the United States and Japan. Raymond was also the Consul of Czechoslovakia to Japan from 1926 to 1939, in which year the Czech diplomacy was closed down after the occupation of the European country by Nazi Germany. His initial work with American architects Cass Gilbert and Frank Lloyd Wright gave him an insight into the use of concrete for texture and structure that he would refine throughout his six decade career. At studio practices in New Hope, Pennsylvania and Tokyo, he explored traditional Japanese building techniques combined with the latest In American building innovations. Raymond applied these principles to a wide range of residential, commercial, religious and institutional projects in Japan, America, India and the Philippines. Along with British Architect Josiah Conder, Raymond is recognized as one of the fathers of modern architecture in Japan. Biography Raymond was born on 10 May 1888, in Kladno, Central Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) to Alois Reimann and his wife R≈Ø≈æena. Following the death of his mother and the bankruptcy of his father's shop the family moved to Prague in 1905. Raymond started at the Re√°ln√© gymnasium (secondary school aimed at more technical/practical sciences) in Kladno, then continued at a similar school in Prague. In 1906 he entered Vysok√° ≈†kola Technick√°, the Czech Polytechnic Institute, studying under Josef Schultz and Jan Koula. He completed his studies in Trieste in 1910 before leaving for New York City. There, he began a three-year employment with Cass Gilbert, working on a number of projects including external architectural details for the Woolworth Building and the Austin, Nichols and Company Warehouse in Brooklyn. His experience on the latter of these gave him an insight into the structural and textural properties of concrete. He began studying painting at the Independent School of Art in the Lincoln Square Arcade Building in 1912, but was forced to curtail a painting trip to Italy and North Africa with the onset of World War I. On his trip back to New York, he met his future wife and business partner, No√©mi Pernessin, and they were wed on 15 December 1914. In early 1916 he became an American citizen, naturalizing his name, Anton√≠n Reimann, to Antonin Raymond. = Employment with Frank Lloyd Wright = Raymond's initial encounter with the work of Frank Lloyd Wright came in 1908‚Äì1910 when he saw a small monograph and later (1910) a large portfolio of Wright's work published in Berlin. In his autobiography, Raymond recounts how deeply he and his fellow students were impressed by Wright's design: \\"Wright had restated the principles of building; he had overcome the cell, liberated the plan, made space flow, given buildings a human scale and blended them with nature, all in a romantic, sensual and original way that left us breathless.\\" Through the influence of a mutual friend, Frank Lloyd Wright agreed to employ Raymond from May 1916. Initially, Raymond and No√©mi worked with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin. In 1917 he enlisted with the United States Army serving overseas with the American Expeditionary Force. Upon his discharge from the army and his return to New York, Wright persuaded him to go to Tokyo with him to work on the Imperial Hotel. Although he remained as Wright's chief assistant for one year, he soon became bored with the work. He became concerned that \\"the design had nothing in common with Japan, its climate, its traditions, its people and its culture\\". Also, whilst his work with Gilbert showed him the great possibilities of concrete, Wright did not see concrete in the same way, preferring to encase it with brickwork or carved Oya Stone. Although Raymond proposed to continue working for Wright, he was eventually dismissed in January 1921. In February of the same year he set up the American Architectural and Engineering Company in Tokyo with Leon Whittaker Slack.  Japan and the Inter-war years  In the Tokyo Woman's Christian College, commenced in 1924, Raymond's architecture can be seen to still be heavily influenced by Wright. Its low, hipped roof and overhanging eaves are reminiscent of Wright's Prairie Houses. This early work also demonstrates his interest in Czech Cubism and the work of Auguste Perret. Reinanzaka House (1924)After their own house was destroyed in the Great Kant≈ç earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic in their use of this new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses. The house itself had metal fenestration, tubular steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater downpipes. The interior too was well in advance of other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered tubular steel furniture. After a number of staff changes, the practice was renamed Antonin Raymond, Architect. =Czechoslovak Consul in Japan= Italian embassy villa in Nikko (1928) Summer House, Karuizawa (1933), today part of the Peynet MuseumDespite becoming a naturalized American citizen in 1916, Raymond became the honorary consul for the Czechoslovak Republic, representing the government of T. G. Masaryk. This gave him influence outside those circles normally associated with an architect of his age. From 1928 to 1930, Raymond designed and remodelled the American, Soviet and French embassies. He also undertook work for the Rising Sun Petroleum Company, designing 17 earthquake- proof and fireproof employee houses, the general office building, the manager's residence and two prototype service stations, one in steel and the other in concrete. All were constructed in an International Modern Style. =Corbusier inspiration= Since the Reinanzaka House, Raymond had been interested in the work of Swiss architect Le Corbusier. He acknowledged that further contribution of Corbusier's ideas to the practice came in 1930, when Kunio Maekawa (who had just returned from two years working for Le Corbusier in his Paris Office) joined. He later applied Le Corbusier's ideas to vernacular Japanese architecture. Based upon Le Corbusier's unbuilt residential scheme for Mr. Errazuris in Chile, he designed a summer house for himself in Karuizawa, Nagano. Where Corbusier had used rough masonry and a tiled butterfly roof, Raymond used cedar with larch thatch. Although the design was criticised by an American reviewer for being a copy of Le Corbusier's design, the Frenchman was so flattered and surprised that he included a photo of it in the third volume of his Oeuvre compl√®te: > Please be assured that there is no bitterness between us, but‚Äìas you > yourself say‚Äìyou made a slight mistake, that is you neglected to send me a > note when you published the images of your Tokyo house, which is very > pretty, by the way. Extract of a letter from Le Corbusier to Antonin > Raymond, 7 May 1935. In 1922, Raymond had been admitted to Tokyo Golf Club and when it relocated to Asaka, Saitama in 1932, he was asked to design it. His links to golfer Shiro Akaboshi also led to several residential commissions. In 1937 in Tokyo, Articles of Association forming a new firm, Reymondo Kenchiku Sekkei Jimusho, were signed by Antonin, No√©mi and a number of Japanese architects, including Junz≈ç Yoshimura.  Sri Aurobindo Ashram  Golconde dormitory of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry (1935) In January 1938, Antonin, No√©mi and their son left Tokyo bound for America. This six-month journey took them initially to the Indian subcontinent and then on to Europe, including a trip to Prague. In 1935, Raymond's office had accepted a commission to design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents. Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech architect who had worked for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make door handles and hinges. Raymond sought to mitigate the effects of the Pondicherry climate and oriented the Golconde dormitory (as it became known), so that its main facades faced north and south to make use of the prevailing breeze. A combination of moveable louvres on the exterior skin and woven teak sliding doors permitted ventilation without compromising on privacy. The building is still in use as an ashram today. It was the first modernist building in India.  The New Hope experiment  In 1939, Raymond's architectural practice in the United States began with the purchase and conversion of his farm and studio in New Hope, Pennsylvania. He and his wife's goal was to \\"create a physical and intellectual environment that mirrored and supported their approach to modern design-one that synthesised International Style developments with lessons learned from Japan's craft tradition\\". They hoped that the lifestyle and design ethos that they would create, would be simpler and more in tune with nature, similar in set up to Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin Fellowship. The Raymonds modified the house to create a more open plan feel, separated by Japanese fusuma partitions and sh≈çji screens. The rooms were filled with objects of art, including rugs designed by No√©mi and crockery by the Mingei designer Minagawa Masu. Raymond developed a prospectus for aspiring architects to come and live and study at New Hope and he attracted at least 20. In addition to teaching practical design solutions, the apprentices had hands-on work with various building trades. Farm work and hay making contributed a physical aspect. Students included Junz≈ç Yoshimura and Carl Graffunder, and the farm was visited by people like Eero Saarinen and Alvar Aalto. Once the students had become settled, Raymond sought real-world projects for them to work upon, to put his theories into practice. Projects included an assortment of houses and extensions in New Jersey, Connecticut and Long Island. In May 1943, the Raymonds vouched for George Nakashima and his family, releasing them from a Japanese internment camp in Idaho, so that they could come and live at the New Hope farm.  The war years (1941‚Äì1945)  With the approach of the Second World War, Raymond moved back to New York, ending the New Hope experiment. He formed a partnership with civil engineer Arthur Tuttle, structural engineer Elwyn Seelye and mechanical engineer Clyde Place. With the country's emphasis on the war effort, the company focused on US army contracts. Their work included: prefabricated houses at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey (1942) and Camp Shanks, New York (1942‚Äì1943) and housing and an airport in Fort Dix, New Jersey (1943). Controversially, in 1943, Raymond was asked to design a series of middle class Japanese style homes on which the Army could test the effectiveness ordnance (specifically incendiaries). These houses were eventually erected on the Dugway Proving Ground, nicknamed \\"Japanese village\\". Raymond admitted in his autobiography that he was not proud of the work.  Practice with Ladislav Rado  After the war, Raymond's practice with Tuttle, Seelye and Place was dissolved. He formed a new company with Slovak architect, Ladislav Leland Rado (1909‚Äì1993), and named it Raymond & Rado. Although this company lasted until Raymond's death in 1976, they practised apart, with Rado in the New York office and Raymond in Tokyo. Whilst Raymond explored pottery and sculpture (making friends with Tar≈ç Okamoto and Ade Bethune), Rado pursued an orthogonal rationalism that Raymond would eventually distance himself from. Projects in the United States during the late 1940s allowed Raymond to gain a foothold in occupied Japan. This helped to restart the building boom in occupied Japan after the war. This was mainly achieved through contacts made in his previous practice and those that he and Rado made in New York. Their single story Great River Station on the Long Island Rail Road, expressed Raymond's fondness for inexpensive, simple materials. It had fieldstone retaining walls and a flat roof supported in each corner with a redwood post. The wide expanse of glazing created a modernist pavilion. In the St. Joseph the Worker Chapel, Victorias, in the Philippines, Raymond worked with liturgical artist Ade Bethune, to produce mosaic murals and a lacquerware tabernacle inside the reinforced concrete church. The interior was adorned with colourful frescoes by Alfonso Ossorio. The church acted as a social centre for employees of the Ossorio sugar cane refinery. The church is regarded as one of the first examples of modern sacred architecture in the country. The practice were also responsible for a number of parks and recreation buildings across the United States in the late 1940s, built largely to commemorate victory in the war.  The Reader's Digest Building  In 1947, Raymond petitioned General MacArthur for permission to enter occupied Japan in order to participate in the reconstruction process. His staff from Reymondo Kenchiku Sekkei Jimusho had looked after the drawings and documents of the office through the war and Raymond decided to reopen the office.Stewart (1987), p. 165 Raymond received the commission for the Reader's Digest Building from Mrs DeWitt Wallace on his return from Japan in 1949. She wanted a design that would show the best that America could offer. The site acquired for the building was opposite the Hirakawa Gate of the Imperial Palace. Its choice was treated with great resentment by the Japanese who felt that favouritism was shown by the Occupation authorities in allowing an American company to utilise a prominent site that would have served better as a park. Taking influence from Le Corbusier, Raymond responded to this criticism by masterplanning the site by using a Ville Radieuse inspired layout with the building set in gardens with sculptures by the Japanese American sculptor, Isamu Noguchi. The long, rectilinear, two-storey building, had a double cantilevered frame supported on a single row of concrete columns. These columns tilted outwards from a vertical position. Floor to ceiling glazing on the second storey opened out onto a balcony running the length of the building. It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles, underfloor electricity ducts and fluorescent lighting. It is considered the first large building in which Raymond managed to use his principles of simplicity, economy of materials, elegance and lightness learned from his residential works. Raymond cited the design of the Hiroshima Peace Museum by Kenzo Tange as being an external imitation of the Reader's Digest Building. Despite winning awards when first completed, the Reader's Digest Building was demolished in 1963 to be replaced by the nine-floor Palaceside Building, a mixed used office building designed by Sh≈çji Hayashi that for many years has served as the headquarters of the Mainichi Newspaper.  Experimentation in Tokyo  Gunma Music Center (1955‚Äì61) Nanzan University campus in Nagoya (1964) Raymond purchased land in the Nishi Azabu district of Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces. Raymond sought to use the design and construction of the office as a platform to inform prototype dwellings for the post war reconstruction of Japan. In 1955, Raymond began a commission in Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture for a Music Centre to house the Gunma Symphony Orchestra. Out of respect for the historic site and the budget constraints, he designed a building built on three premises: it would have an economical structural system, there would be equality of sight lines and acoustics for each seat, and the building would have a low profile without a fly tower. Raymond achieved these aims by using a series of thick, reinforced concrete ribs connected together like an accordion and spanning . In 1961, he was commissioned to design the Catholic-based Nanzan University in Nagoya. It was one of the largest projects that he would undertake. The campus was orientated on a north‚Äìsouth axis across rolling hills and the eight buildings were arranged to suit the topography and harmonise with the landscape. In-situ concrete is used throughout the scheme and each building has its own concrete form, some with pilotis, others with shells. Located to the east of the Nanzan Campus is the Divine Word Seminary Chapel (1962). This is a building that exploits the plastic capacity of concrete, with two intersecting shells forming a bell tower. These are punctured with vertical slots which allow light to radiate along the curved interior walls.  Influence of his wife No√©mi Raymond  Antonin Raymond and No√©mi Pernessin in New York, ca. 1914 Born in 1889 in Cannes to Swiss-French parents, No√©mi moved to New York in 1900, and later studied Fine Art and Philosophy at Columbia Teachers College. Here, she was influenced by the painter and educator Arthur Wesley Dow. During Raymond's period of training as a painter, No√©mi supported them both by doing graphic work for publications like the New York Sun and New York Herald Tribune. When they both moved to Taliesin she became interested in 3D design. She also polished her knowledge of Japanese crafts, becoming a broker for clients such as Rudolph Schindler's wife, Pauline Gibling. No√©mi's influence on Raymond during the inter-war years was substantial. She encouraged him to break away from Wright's rigid style and explore the design of the Reinanzaka House. She increased her interest in Japanese art and philosophy, including ukiyo-e woodblock prints and introduced Raymond to various influential people, including the mystic philosopher Rudolf Steiner. She expanded her design repertoire to include textiles, rugs, furniture, glass and silverware. No√©mi exhibited in Tokyo in 1936 and New York in 1940, and her textiles were chosen by American designers like Louis Kahn to cover furniture in their designs. No√©mi also contributed to the design of the studio in Nishiazabu and a series of Raymond's villas during the 1950s, including the Hayama Villa (1958).  A legacy in concrete  Interior of St. Anselm's Church, Tokyo (1954) Divine Word Seminary Chapel of Nanzan University, Nagoya (1962) When Wright left, Raymond set up his own office, he advertised himself as a specialist in reinforced concrete. He was aware of its textural properties from Cass Gilbert, its structural ones from Wright, and its benefits in relation to earthquake proofing. His first major independent project in 1921 was to design Hoshi Pharmaceutical School, which was one of the first reinforced concrete buildings in Tokyo. Raymond used precast concrete to form decorative elements for the building, such as window mullions. In a partially successful experiment, he used wooden formwork to imprint a texture onto the concrete (but he chose to cover it up). On the Reinanzaka House, the labourers were skilled in the use of wood, and helped Raymond engrain the texture of cedar onto the concrete. This was further explored on the Tetsuma Akaboshi and the Morinosuke Kawasaki houses, where the concrete walls of the luxurious interiors were imprinted with cypress textures. On the Karuizawa Studio, workmen polished the concrete with sand and straw to reveal the texture of the aggregate. Whilst at Nanzan University, the south facing facades were cast with checkerboard patterns, with applied metalwork casting abstract shadows on the surface. Raymond's techniques endeared him to the Japanese architectural psyche, and in 1958, the editor of the architectural magazine Shinkenchiku, Yoshioka Yasugoro remarked, \\"it is doubtful that concrete is handled with such pains anywhere except in Japan. The idea of an exposed concrete surface seems to fit in with Japanese ideas of decor.\\" Post war architects like Tadao Ando have become famous for their use of exposed concrete. Raymond's use of a traditional post and beam structure in concrete for the Reinanzaka House was a technique that was adopted by post war Japanese architects such as Kenzo Tange. Predating Le Corbusier's work in Chandigarh, the Golconde dormitory used a monolithic concrete structure with deep overhangs and louvres to adapt to specific climatic conditions. The building pioneered the use of reinforced concrete in India. Antonin Raymond died at St. Mary's Hospital in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, on 25 October 1976, aged 88. His wife No√©mi died four years later, aged 91. Raymond Architectural Design Office continues to practice in Tokyo.

After they leave, he decides to court Clarice, mistakenly thinking her name to be that of her friend, Lucrece. G√©ronte, Dorante's father, announces to his son that he has found a girl for him to marry (Clarice). Dorante, wrongly believing that the girl that he likes is Lucrece, concocts an outrageous lie that he is already married in order to avoid having to marry Clarice. Meanwhile, Clarice is secretly engaged to Alcippe, who happens to be a childhood friend of Dorante. When Alcippe confronts Dorante in a duel, Dorante clarifies that he's not in love with Clarice, but Lucrece. To build the plot, the author throws in some hysterical side characters like Dorante's butler Cliton, and Clarice's and Lucrece's foxy lady maid, Isabelle who has a twin named Sabine. After more fabrications and complications (Dorante revealing that his \\"wife\\" is pregnant), G√©ronte is infuriated to discover that he was lied to; Dorante eventually tells the truth and the plot is resolved happily. Production history The play was produced at the Old Vic theater in 1990, in a translation by Ranjit Bolt.

Transvaginal oocyte retrieval is more properly referred to as transvaginal ovum retrieval when the oocytes have matured into ova, as is normally the case in IVF. Procedure Under ultrasound guidance, the operator inserts a needle through the vaginal wall and into an ovarian follicle, taking care not to injure organs located between the vaginal wall and the ovary. The other end of the needle is attached to a suction device. Once the follicle is entered, suction is gently applied to aspirate follicular fluid and with it, hopefully, cellular material including the oocyte. The follicular fluid is delivered to a technician in the IVF laboratory to identify and quantify the ova. Next, other follicles are aspirated. Once the ovarian follicles have been aspirated on one ovary, the needle is withdrawn, and the procedure repeated on the other ovary. It is not unusual to remove 20 oocytes as women are generally hyperstimulated in advance of this procedure. After completion, the needle is withdrawn, and hemostasis is achieved. The procedure usually lasts 2060 minutes. Initially performed using transabdominal ultrasonography, TVOR is currently performed with a transvaginal ultrasound transducer with an attached needle. TVOR is performed in an operating room or a physician's office, with the (female) subject in the lithotomy position. TVOR is usually performed under procedural sedation, general anesthesia, paracervical block, or sometimes spinal anesthesia. Local anesthesia is not typically used because local anesthetic agents interfere with follicular cleavage and the technique requires multiple needle punctures. =Adjunctive procedures= Follicular flushing has not been found to increase pregnancy rates, nor result in an increase in oocyte yield. On the other hand, it requires a significantly longer operative time and more analgesia. Seminal fluid contains several proteins that interact with epithelial cells of the cervix and uterus, inducing active gestational immune tolerance. There are significantly improved outcomes when women are exposed to seminal plasma around the time of oocyte retrieval, with statistical significance for clinical pregnancy, but not for ongoing pregnancy or live birth rates with the limited data available. Timing TVOR is typically performed after ovarian hyperstimulation, where oocytes are pharmacologically stimulated to mature. When the ovarian follicles have reached a certain degree of development, induction of final oocyte maturation is performed, generally by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). TVOR is typically performed 3436 hours after hCG injection, when the eggs are fully mature but just prior to rupture of the follicles. Complications Injection of hCG as a trigger for ovulation confers a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, especially in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who have been hyperstimulated during previous assisted reproduction cycles. Complications of TVOR include injury to pelvic organs, hemorrhage, and infection. Occurring more often in lean patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian hemorrhage after TVOR is a potentially catastrophic and not so rare complication. Additional complications may result from the administration of intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. These include asphyxia caused by airway obstruction, apnea, hypotension, and pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents. Propofol-based anesthetic techniques result in significant concentrations of propofol in follicular fluid. As propofol has been shown to have deleterious effects on oocyte fertilization (in a mouse model), some authors have suggested that the dose of propofol administered during anesthesia should be limited, and also that the retrieved oocytes should be washed free of propofol. Anecdotal evidence suggests that certain airborne chemical contaminants and particles, especially volatile organic compounds (VOC), may be toxic to and impair the growth and development of embryos if present in sufficient concentrations in the ambient atmosphere of an IVF incubator. History This technique was first developed by Pierre Dellenbach and colleagues in Strasbourg, France, and reported in 1984. Steptoe and Edwards used laparoscopy to recover oocytes when IVF was introduced, and laparoscopy was the major method of oocyte recovery until TVOR was introduced.

It is one of New Zealand's two alpine species of sundew, the other being Drosera stenopetala. The specific epithet, which translates as \\"of Arthur\\" from Latin, is a reference to Mount Arthur, in north-eastern Tasmania, the type locality of the species.A.F. Mark and Nancy M. Adams, \\"New Zealand Alpine Plants\\", Reed, 1973Bruce Salmon, \\"Carnivorous Plants of New Zealand\\". Ecosphere Publications, 2001. Drosera arcturi grows in bogs, tarns and seepages, most commonly at montane or alpine elevations and is also commonly found in Sphagnum bogs. It is found in alpine areas from the East Cape of the North Island, New Zealand, southwards to Stewart Island, New Zealand. It is found above 1500m altitude in the North Island, descending to sea level in the South Island. It is also found in the mountains of southeastern Australia and in Tasmania, where it is occasionally found growing down to sea level in the west and south-west of the island. In New Zealand, D. arcturi is often found growing in clumps alongside Utricularia dichotoma.Pietropaolo, J. & P. Pietropaolo. 1986. Carnivorous Plants of the World. Timber Press, Inc. The leaves of D. arcturi are linear, 1‚Äì5 cm long, undivided, and range in colour from pale green to muddy brown, to maroon if subjected to full sunlight. Like all other species of Drosera, D. arcturi catches insects using sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves. In D. arcturi, these glandular hairs are red. Young leaves begin at the center of the plant and are folded along their center. Once the young leaf reaches full maturity it unfolds like a book. A carpet of Drosera arcturi growing in shallow water in a creek bed near Lake Pedder, Tasmania, Australia. The plants' first upright leaves emerge in spring. After two or three leaves have formed, the nominal form produces a small, solitary white flower, 13 mm across, which is borne on a short stalk in summer, and positioned near the top of the leaves. The giant, lowland form produces 1‚Äì5 flowers on a long inflorescence up to 25 cm long. Flowers are present from November to February and fruits are present in January‚ÄìMarch. D. arcturi is a summer grower, and after flowering its leaves gradually reduce in size to form an elongated, horn-shaped hibernaculum. In this form it passes the cold, harsh alpine winters. The hibernaculum is normally buried near the surface of the soil or moss and is usually covered with snow for several months during winter.

In 1990, the UK Crime Writers' Association named it one of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time. Plot Robert Blair, a local solicitor, is called on to defend two women, Marion Sharpe and her mother, who are accused of kidnapping and beating a fifteen-year-old war orphan named Betty Kane. Set in Milford, the novel opens with the Sharpes about to be interviewed by local police and Scotland Yard, represented by Inspector Alan Grant (who is the protagonist of five other Tey novels). Marion calls Blair and, although his firm does not do criminal cases, he agrees to come out to their home, \\"The Franchise\\", to look out for their interests during the questioning. Betty's account is that during the Easter holidays, she went to stay with her aunt and uncle, the Tilsits, near Larborough. After a week, she wrote to her adoptive parents, the Wynns, to say she was enjoying herself and would spend another three weeks with the Tilsits. Then one evening, waiting for a bus, the Sharpe women approached her in their car and offered her a lift. They took her to the Franchise, demanded that she become a domestic worker, and, upon her refusal, imprisoned her in the attic. Betty alleges that they starved and beat her until she escaped. When Blair meets Marion and Mrs. Sharpe, who are sensible and forthright, he believes them innocent, and he distrusts Betty. Yet Betty does have bruises from a beating, and she describes items and rooms inside the Franchise accurately. Later in the week, a newspaper runs a long story from Betty's side, based on an interview with her vengeful brother, Leslie. Robert Blair now finds that the townspeople of Milford are mostly against the Sharpes. An exception is Stanley Peters, a local car mechanic and friend of Blair, who says that Betty reminds him of an ex-girlfriend who was promiscuous and deceitful. As interest in the case builds over a few weeks, locals engage in overt hostility against the Sharpes: public snubbing, then graffiti on their walls, then smashing of the windows; the vandalism culminates when the Franchise is destroyed by arson. Stanley has become a friend and ally to the Sharpes, serving as a night guard for them, and then providing them shelter when their home is burned down. Blair is assisted in his search for clues against Betty Kane by his cousin, Nevil Bennet, who also works at the law firm, and his friend Kevin Macdermott, a flamboyant London barrister. The clues that they chiefly uncover are in the manner of character evidence, and Tey supplies a colourful variety. Examples include the facts that Betty has an eidetic memory; when Betty returns home after the alleged kidnapping, the only item she has with her is lipstick; she tells the Wynns about her abduction not right away, but in various details over a few days; Betty's mother was promiscuous, \\"a bad mother and a bad wife\\", according to a neighbour; Mrs. Tilsit, the aunt, tells Blair that Betty spent most of her holiday time not with her aunt and uncle, but in unsupervised freedom: going to the cinema, using buses, and eating lunch away from home; Betty had befriended a teenage girl who had once worked for the Sharpes as a cleaner, whom Betty had bullied. She is described by a couple of people as demure and looking as though \\"butter wouldn't melt in her mouth\\"; one of them, a restaurant waiter, tells Blair that Betty came in for tea several times, looking wholesome: \\"And then one day she picked up the man at the next table. You could have knocked me over with a feather.\\" Robert Blair, who has been a lifelong bachelor living with his woolly-minded Aunt Lin, becomes strongly attracted to Marion Sharpe, who is described as gypsy-ish (because of her dark hair, browned skin, and habit of wearing colourful scarves). Marion, who likes Blair, is however determined to remain single and stay with her sharp-tongued mother, who is her best friend. Nevil, although engaged, also finds Marion attractive; an aspiring poet, he describes her as \\"all compact of fire and metal. ... People don't marry women like Marion Sharpe, any more than they marry winds and clouds. Any more than they marry Joan of Arc.\\" The book maintains the suspense of the Sharpes' guilt or innocence for the first half, and then, when the reader feels certain they are innocent (though all the evidence points to them) the tension comes from how they will avoid being wrongfully incarcerated. Things go right down to the wire, with a lot of detailed investigative work paying off in a satisfying fashion at the trial. Inspiration Although given a contemporary (post- Second World War) setting, it is inspired by the 18th-century case of Elizabeth Canning, a maidservant who claimed she had been kidnapped and held prisoner for a month. It is most probably based on a reading of Arthur Machen's non-fiction account of the case The Canning Wonder (1925) as the plot follows a similar line to Machen's thinking.Judith Moore ‚Äì The Appearance of Truth: The Story of Elizabeth Canning and 18th Century Narrative (1994), p. 225 Adaptations The novel was adapted for the film The Franchise Affair in 1951, starring Michael Denison as Blair, Dulcie Gray as Marion Sharpe, Marjorie Fielding as Mrs. Sharpe, and Ann Stephens as Betty Kane. It has also been adapted twice for television, in 1962 and 1988, and once for radio in 2005. The 1962 version featured Michael Aldridge as Blair, Rosalie Crutchley as Marion Sharpe, Meg Wynn Owen as Betty Kane, and Veronica Turleigh as Mrs. Sharpe.

He was not a Cebuano but an Ibanag from Isabela province who came to Cebu to help the Cebuanos in their struggle against Spain and the United States. Biography General Mateo Luga was born in Paoay, Ilocos Norte, but later on migrated to Tumauini Isabela province. He responded to the call-to- arms against the Spaniards towards the end of the 19th century. He left home in 1896, joined the Katipuneros in Bulacan, Manila, Laguna, and Cavite, and he fought the Spanish forces in Balinta, Antipolo, Montalban, San Pedro de Makate, Palipanan, Monting Lupa, Kalo-okan, and other areas until early 1899. During this period, Mateo Luga gained the necessary skills and experience to lead men in combat. Between the summer of 1898 and mid-1899, the province of Cebu witnessed a so-called \\"war within a war.\\" At the time, the armed insurrection against Spain was at its peak. In December 1898, the Spanish Governor Adolfo Montero abandoned the province of Cebu and sought refuge in Zamboanga. As a consequence, Juan Faller Climaco and Arcadio Maxilom established a revolutionary government in Cebu. Climaco had served as a Capitan Municipal of Toledo, and Maxilom was a member of the Katipunan. The two Cebuanos were appointed chief of staff and councilor of peace and internal order, respectively. With the unexpected arrival of the American occupation forces in Cebu, armed hostilities broke out between the American occupying forces and the fledgling Cebuano revolutionary force in February 1899. In April 1899, General Emilio Aguinaldo and Secretary of War General Antonio Luna handpicked Mateo Luga as the Katipunan's personal adviser to the Cebu revolutionary government. With his two bodyguards, Manalo Luga and another Luga cousin, Mateo proceeded to Cebu disguised as a sailor on board the cargo ship Butuan. On the way to Cebu, the group passed through Iloilo where Mateo Luga met his future wife, Ruperta Valdez, a comely Ilongga of Spanish descent. He proceeded to Cebu where he was arrested by the local revolutionaries upon arrival, on suspicion of being a Spanish spy. He was brought before General Climaco, who freed him upon ascertaining that he was indeed sent by General Aguinaldo and General Luna to Cebu, based on a letter written by the former. The Cebu revolutionary government divided Cebu into three operational sectors: the north under General Maxilom, the south under General Troadio Galicano, and the central zone under General Luga. From then on, the combat exploits of Mateo Luga in the Visayas began. He was the only non-Visayan in the Cebu revolutionary force (except for Don Bonifacio Aranas who is from Camiguin, a province of Mindanao). The first encounter between the forces of General Luga and the Americans was in Mahayahay. Raids, assaults, ambushes, and frontal confrontations between the forces were carried out from 1899 to the latter part of 1901. General Luga's fiercest battle was at Sudlon, the Revolutionary redoubt of the Katipuneros. The confrontation lasted for nine days, until January 8, 1900. The Americans assaulted the Kota defenses of General Luga, only to turn back, leaving their dead and wounded behind. Despite the superior armaments of the Americans, it was the Katipuneros' knowledge of the terrain, their fighting acumen, and their willingness to sacrifice that gave them an edge over the Americans. In the ensuing months, forays were made into American territory. On one occasion, General Luga and his force almost captured General Henry W. Lawton at Pardo. The Americans were having a party when General Luga conducted a raid, which surprised the Americans. General Lawton, who was present, escaped by running to the seashore, boarding a launch, and remaining on board while the raid was in progress. Other bloody battles were those in San Nicolas, Bulusan, Guadalope, Mabolo, Talamban, and the city itself. General Luga was a wanted man, and his wife and children were imprisoned by the Americans to force him to surrender. Instead of succumbing to their pressure, he slipped into the city and rescued his family. General Mateo Luga was a worthy opponent against the Americans. Cunning and elusive, he earned such nicknames as Alimokon (a species of wild dove which is difficult to capture), Agta (the black giant of Cebuano folklore); and Tagolilong (a mysterious being which can make itself invisible at will).

Jungle Patrol: The Story of the Philippine > Constabulary. New York: E.P. Dutton. Chapter XVI The end of hostilities On September 15, 1901, General Robert P. Hughes, heading two thousand troops, arrived in Cebu, and towns, villages, and crops were laid to waste. Homes and the people's means of livelihood were demolished, and little distinction was made between the combatants and the victims of the war. Bereft of the necessary support to continue hostilities, terms of peace were discussed with the Americans. One by one, the revolutionary leaders surrendered after General Maxilom laid down his arms on October 27, 1901. General Luga and his troops surrendered to Captain Frank McIntyre of the 19th U.S. Infantry on the same day.Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons General Luga believed that the surrender was not the end of his fighting career. He accepted the commission to become an officer of the constabulary organized by the Americans to maintain peace and order in the locality. Despite his mistrust of the Americans, he accepted the commission they offered, hoping that he could help bring peace back to the countryside. He joined the constabulary force along with a few men, including General Rafael Crame. His exploits as a peace officer reached all the way to Samar and Leyte, running after a bandit group known as the Pulahanes. He was tasked to make Cebu clean and bandit-free. The year 1908 found Luga completely in control. He had risen to the rank of captain in the constabulary, where he was known as one of the most capable and valiant officers. Home is the soldier from the hills In 1914, rumors were rife that the United States and Japan would be the two world powers vying to control South East Asia. Captain Luga openly expressed his disagreement with this development, having been critical of the onerous provisions of the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act. The act provided for the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth, under which a ten-year transitional government supervised by the United States would be set up prior to independence, as well as the reservation of American military and naval bases in the Philippines. General Luga called the act, \\"a castle coated with honey\\". He continued: \\"Those naval and military reservations are the stumbling blocks to the granting of our freedom and in our policy on foreign relations. There is really nothing wrong with us if America will not go to war with other countries. But if she does, we will be the first ones to suffer for we will be made to pay dearly for the consequences.\\" This visionary statement would be proven later during the Second World War. Although General Luga had an unblemished record of service, his opinions led him to be placed under surveillance. Eventually, his pride led him to resign from the constabulary. Upon his resignation in 1914, he was employed by the Philippine Refining Company, an American firm that was the predecessor of Unilever Philippines. After this, he worked for the Public Lands Commission, where he was assigned the task of giving away homesteads to deserving applicants. On his own, he was able to acquire 24 hectares in Sagay, Negros Occidental where he retired into a simple country life with his wife, Ruperta, and their children, Maria, Jose, Pilar and twins Emilio and Antonio, who were named after General Emilio Aguinaldo and General Antonio Luna. A veteran's wish On January 23, 1924 (the 25th Anniversary of the establishment of the First Philippine Republic held at the Barasoain Church in Malolos, Bulacan), General Luga was interviewed by Celestino T. Alfafara of the Cebuano periodical Bag-ong Kusog. When General Luga was asked what he wished for the Filipino people, he replied: > \\"We the veterans, are already old, but before we die, there is only one wish > that I am asking from God. Even though we have no money to leave behind > because we are poor, we do wish that before we go to our final resting > ground, we can see that you who are left behind can enjoy the fruits of the > freedom we have been hoping for.\\" When his last taps were sung On his way back home to Negros from a visit to his hometown in Isabela, General Mateo Noriel Luga was found to be stricken with cancer. He died in Manila in 1935. His funeral was a reunion of his comrades-in-arms, including General Aguinaldo and the remaining Katipuneros.

Digital colored Fan art of Babman by digicatures Babman (a spoof of Batman) is an adventure story arc of the Philippine comic strip series Pugad Baboy, created by Pol Medina Jr. and originally published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. This particular story arc lasts 37 strips long. In 2002, the story arc was reprinted in Katorse, the fourteenth book compilation of the comic strip series. Synopsis Babman, the \\"Pork Knight\\", is Bab's secret identity. He is otherwise known as Bruce Swine (a spoof of Bruce Wayne) to residents of Gothom City (a spoof of Gotham City and a twist on the Filipino word, gutom, meaning \\"hunger\\" - as Gothom City is a squatters' area.) where as Babman, he patrols at night looking for situations with potential for violence and criminal activity. In Sapang Talahib (Grass Creek), a different squatters' area, Bab meet Mr. Chan, owner of the \\"Shaolin Temple\\", a restaurateur who hired him as a waiter. Mr. Chan becomes Bab's friend and master in the Kung Fu style known as the \\"Stoned Dragon\\", a martial arts technique practiced with the aid of a healthy dose of marijuana. Mr. Chan declares Bab a \\"Stoned Master\\" and has him receive the Master's mark - a Dragon and Tiger tattoo made by placing cast iron hot plates on both forearms. Bab's mother, however, discovers his \\"Stoned Master\\" status and has him rehabilitated for four months. Upon his release, he returns to Sapang Talahib, and discovers that the area had been converted into a parking lot for a nearby mall. He follows the former residents to Cavite, where they had been resettled in a place they called Gothom City, as Sapang Talahib mysteriously suffered fire, allegedly done by corrupt police officers to forcefully abandon the area, while reasoning behind the fire as \\"Faulty Electrical Wiring\\", a common cause of fire among squatter's area. =\\"Samting fishy\\"= A few months pass before the Gothom City residents are harassed by goons hired by the lot's owner. Babman decides to defend the residents from these goons, using the street fighting techniques he had learned from Mr. Chan. Some time later, Bab learns that the residents were being moved again, this time by hiring professional squatters and goons to harass the residents, despite their earlier vehement opposition to being relocated. This arouses his suspicions that something fishy was going on, while fresh and dried fish vendors walks by. His investigation reveal that a certain Do√±a Fe Bagamundo had bought the Gothom City lot. He also discovered that the same Do√±a Fe had bought all the lots formerly occupied by the Gothom City residents. Babman stakes out the residents at the new relocation site they called Malunggay Uno (Moringa One). Goons again harass the squatters, but instead of confronting them, Babman begins tailing the bad guys. As he suspected, the goons make their way to Do√±a Fe's mansion. Eavesdropping on the group, Babman learns their modus operandi: Do√±a Fe's goons pretend to be the lot owner's bad guys; they would encourage violence until public sympathy fell in favor of the squatters and the lot owner was forced to sell the land. Babman learns the awful truth - the people he had been defending are professional squatters. He tries to determine who the legitimate squatters were and also interviews the lots' former owners, before getting into a showdown with Do√±a Fe and her goons. =Unmasking the mastermind= Babman captures the goons and gathers the residents in a meeting to explain the whole plot. He prevails on the residents to cooperate when he brings the case to the Solicitor-General, in order for the lots to be returned to their rightful owners. He, however, decides not to reveal the identities of the professional squatters just yet. He is about to take Rufo, Do√±a Fe's head goon and the other bad guys to the DILG when he sees something on Rufo's arms. He asks the residents to give him two hours - there is someone missing from his list of bad guys. Babman returns to the \\"Shaolin Temple\\" he encounters the crooked cops who were part of Do√±a Fe's racket. He takes away their guns and goes looking for Mr. Chan. Babman reveals his identity to Mr. Chan, who asks how Babman was able to uncover his collusion with Do√±a Fe. Babman explains that he saw the tiger and dragon tattoo on Rufo's arms. He also details that a check of Mr Chan's files at the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation reveal that he is an illegal alien named Chian Jie Yao who just used Do√±a Fe to buy the land for him, since Philippine laws prohibit foreign land ownership. Bab attempts to arrest Mr. Chan, who blows cannabis smoke at his face and executes the \\"Stoned Dragon\\" technique. Fortunately, Bab had learned a countermeasure; the \\"Curly Joe Defense\\". As Mr. Chan and Bab square off, the crooked cops barge in with their back-up revolvers. Using the fighting technique he had learned from watching Robert Jaworski, \\"Basketball Kung Fu\\", Bab subdues all three bad guys. Mr. Chan's severed head and Do√±a Fe are turned over to the NBI after they were charged with conspiracy, grave threats and arson. The squatters move out of the land while the case is heard. At the end of the story, Polgas stresses that this battle is only one in series of battles and said Mr. Chan and Do√±a Fe are not the only masterminds of the scheme. As he unrolls a scroll near him, Mr. Chan is in the middle, Do√±a Fe in lower rank, there are more higher-ups in the chain, including the Department of Agrarian Reform (for giving Filipinos false hopes), National Housing Authority (for giving titles to foreigners, at the cost of Filipinos), Philippine National Police and AFP officers (acting as foreigners' bodyguards, often sowing discord on their fellow countrymen the supposed to protect), Bureau of Immigration (for giving foreigners citizenship for owning lands owned by Filipinos), Congressmen and Senators (for taking kickbacks on foreigner's bribes for themselves, again at the cost of Filipinos), even Presidents (for turning a blind eye on their people). He explained it all in a sarcastic manner, sarcastic voice and sarcastic facial expressions. Continuity * Babman is the Pork Knight's first appearance as a featured main character; he made his first official appearance, however, in the 1993 story arc The Olongapo Caper, where he also drove the Fatmobile.  Cultural references  * The \\"Fatmobile\\", a spoof of the Batmobile), is a borrowed Volkswagen Beetle with bat-like tailfins and a peace symbol on the hood. Its horn makes an \\"Oink!Oink!\\" sound, similar to that of a pig. * Do√±a Fe gives her complete name as Felicidad Bagamundo y Maldecaralubio viuda de Cancarrote. * Bruce Swine is known as a baryannaire philanthropist among the squatters. Baryannaire is a portmanteau of barya, a Filipino word meaning \\"small change\\", and \\"billionaire\\". * Bruce relieves himself of the pain from carrying plates of sisig in his forearms by cooling them in an ice cream freezer labeled \\"Magnolecta Ice Cream\\". Magnolecta is a portmanteau of rival ice cream companies Magnolia (now owned by the San Miguel Corporation) and Selecta. * Politicians Francisco Tatad and Juan Ponce Enrile, plus former Supreme Court Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. make cameo appearances. In an oblique reference to the 2000 impeachment proceedings against then-President Joseph Estrada, Tatad tells a poor laborer that his second pay envelope is \\"immaterial and irrelevant\\"; Enrile adds, \\"I second the motion\\". In Davide's courtroom, a squatter also admonishes his lawyer to seek a \\"writ of victor corpus\\" (writ of habeas corpus) or a \\"subpoena duces rectum\\" (subpoena duces tecum). Davide's \\"sh\\" pronunciation of words that have \\"s\\" sounds is also present. * Babman's primary weapon is, ironically, his utility belt with the peace symbol buckle. He also uses it as a bottle opener and as an ear-cleaning tool. * The names of the two crooked cops in cahoots with Mr. Chan, Jing and Jude, are an oblique reference to the sons of former Philippine President Joseph Estrada - Jinggoy Estrada and Jude Estrada. Half of one strip, in particular, shows Polgas' long diatribe against the elder Estrada (without mentioning him by name). * The tiger tattoo on Rufo's arm that led Babman to Mr. Chan is actually that of Hobbes, the tiger character from Calvin and Hobbes. *Mr. Chan spoofs David Carradine's Shaolin master in the TV series Kung Fu. This is shown by his restaurant's name, \\"Shaolin Temple\\", and Bab is called \\"Grass-smoker\\", just as Carradine's character Kwai Chang Caine was nicknamed \\"Grasshopper\\". *The back cover of Katorse, in which Babman appears, is a spoof of a cover of Frank Miller's 1986 comic book miniseries The Dark Knight Returns. * Polgas broke the wall in the last part, revealing that the corruption of land grabbing runs deep, not only from the old woman and Mr. Chan, but several Government officials was named part of the corruption.

The advent of protein sequencing allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison, and to use the differences between homologous sequences as a molecular clock to estimate the time since the last common ancestor. In the late 1960s, the neutral theory of molecular evolution provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock, though both the clock and the neutral theory were controversial, since most evolutionary biologists held strongly to panselectionism, with natural selection as the only important cause of evolutionary change. After the 1970s, nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal RNA sequences, the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life.  Early history  Before the rise of molecular biology in the 1950s and 1960s, a small number of biologists had explored the possibilities of using biochemical differences between species to study evolution. Alfred Sturtevant predicted the existence of chromosomal inversions in 1921 and with Dobzhansky constructed one of the first molecular phylogenies on 17 Drosophila Pseudo-obscura strains from the accumulation of chromosomal inversions observed from the hybridization of polyten chromosomes.Dobzhanski, Sturtevant, 1937 Ernest Baldwin worked extensively on comparative biochemistry beginning in the 1930s, and Marcel Florkin pioneered techniques for constructing phylogenies based on molecular and biochemical characters in the 1940s. However, it was not until the 1950s that biologists developed techniques for producing biochemical data for the quantitative study of molecular evolution.Dietrich, \\"Paradox and Persuasion\\", pp. 90-91; Zuckerkandl, \\"On the Molecular Evolutionary Clock\\", p. 34 The first molecular systematics research was based on immunological assays and protein \\"fingerprinting\\" methods. Alan Boyden‚Äîbuilding on immunological methods of George Nuttall‚Äîdeveloped new techniques beginning in 1954, and in the early 1960s Curtis Williams and Morris Goodman used immunological comparisons to study primate phylogeny. Others, such as Linus Pauling and his students, applied newly developed combinations of electrophoresis and paper chromatography to proteins subject to partial digestion by digestive enzymes to create unique two-dimensional patterns, allowing fine-grained comparisons of homologous proteins.Dietrich, \\"Paradox and Persuasion\\", pp. 90-91; Morgan, \\"Emile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling, and the Molecular Evolutionary Clock\\", pp. 161-162. Beginning in the 1950s, a few naturalists also experimented with molecular approaches‚Äînotably Ernst Mayr and Charles Sibley. While Mayr quickly soured on paper chromatography, Sibley successfully applied electrophoresis to egg-white proteins to sort out problems in bird taxonomy, soon supplemented that with DNA hybridization techniques‚Äîthe beginning of a long career built on molecular systematics.Hagen, \\"Naturalists, Molecular Biologists, and the Challenges of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 335-339 While such early biochemical techniques found grudging acceptance in the biology community, for the most part they did not impact the main theoretical problems of evolution and population genetics. This would change as molecular biology shed more light on the physical and chemical nature of genes. = Genetic load, the classical/balance controversy, and the measurement of heterozygosity = At the time that molecular biology was coming into its own in the 1950s, there was a long-running debate‚Äîthe classical/balance controversy‚Äîover the causes of heterosis, the increase in fitness observed when inbred lines are outcrossed. In 1950, James F. Crow offered two different explanations (later dubbed the classical and balance positions) based on the paradox first articulated by J. B. S. Haldane in 1937: the effect of deleterious mutations on the average fitness of a population depends only on the rate of mutations (not the degree of harm caused by each mutation) because more-harmful mutations are eliminated more quickly by natural selection, while less-harmful mutations remain in the population longer. H. J. Muller dubbed this \\"genetic load\\".Dietrich, \\"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 25-28 Muller, motivated by his concern about the effects of radiation on human populations, argued that heterosis is primarily the result of deleterious homozygous recessive alleles, the effects of which are masked when separate lines are crossed‚Äîthis was the dominance hypothesis, part of what Dobzhansky labeled the classical position. Thus, ionizing radiation and the resulting mutations produce considerable genetic load even if death or disease does not occur in the exposed generation, and in the absence of mutation natural selection will gradually increase the level of homozygosity. Bruce Wallace, working with J. C. King, used the overdominance hypothesis to develop the balance position, which left a larger place for overdominance (where the heterozygous state of a gene is more fit than the homozygous states). In that case, heterosis is simply the result of the increased expression of heterozygote advantage. If overdominant loci are common, then a high level of heterozygosity would result from natural selection, and mutation-inducing radiation may in fact facilitate an increase in fitness due to overdominance. (This was also the view of Dobzhansky.)Dietrich, \\"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 26-31 Debate continued through 1950s, gradually becoming a central focus of population genetics. A 1958 study of Drosophila by Wallace suggested that radiation-induced mutations increased the viability of previously homozygous flies, providing evidence for heterozygote advantage and the balance position; Wallace estimated that 50% of loci in natural Drosophila populations were heterozygous. Motoo Kimura's subsequent mathematical analyses reinforced what Crow had suggested in 1950: that even if overdominant loci are rare, they could be responsible for a disproportionate amount of genetic variability. Accordingly, Kimura and his mentor Crow came down on the side of the classical position. Further collaboration between Crow and Kimura led to the infinite alleles model, which could be used to calculate the number of different alleles expected in a population, based on population size, mutation rate, and whether the mutant alleles were neutral, overdominant, or deleterious. Thus, the infinite alleles model offered a potential way to decide between the classical and balance positions, if accurate values for the level of heterozygosity could be found.Dietrich, \\"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 33-41 By the mid-1960s, the techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology‚Äîin particular protein electrophoresis‚Äîprovided a way to measure the level of heterozygosity in natural populations: a possible means to resolve the classical/balance controversy. In 1963, Jack L. Hubby published an electrophoresis study of protein variation in Drosophila; soon after, Hubby began collaborating with Richard Lewontin to apply Hubby's method to the classical/balance controversy by measuring the proportion of heterozygous loci in natural populations. Their two landmark papers, published in 1966, established a significant level of heterozygosity for Drosophila (12%, on average).; and However, these findings proved difficult to interpret. Most population geneticists (including Hubby and Lewontin) rejected the possibility of widespread neutral mutations; explanations that did not involve selection were anathema to mainstream evolutionary biology. Hubby and Lewontin also ruled out heterozygote advantage as the main cause because of the segregation load it would entail, though critics argued that the findings actually fit well with overdominance hypothesis.Dietrich, \\"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 42-45 = Protein sequences and the molecular clock = While evolutionary biologists were tentatively branching out into molecular biology, molecular biologists were rapidly turning their attention toward evolution. After developing the fundamentals of protein sequencing with insulin between 1951 and 1955, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues had published a limited interspecies comparison of the insulin sequence in 1956. Francis Crick, Charles Sibley and others recognized the potential for using biological sequences to construct phylogenies, though few such sequences were yet available. By the early 1960s, techniques for protein sequencing had advanced to the point that direct comparison of homologous amino acid sequences was feasible.Hagen, \\"Naturalists, Molecular Biologists, and the Challenge of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 323-325 In 1961, Emanuel Margoliash and his collaborators completed the sequence for horse cytochrome c (a longer and more widely distributed protein than insulin), followed in short order by a number of other species. In 1962, Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed using the number of differences between homologous protein sequences to estimate the time since divergence, an idea Zuckerkandl had conceived around 1960 or 1961. This began with Pauling's long-time research focus, hemoglobin, which was being sequenced by Walter Schroeder; the sequences not only supported the accepted vertebrate phylogeny, but also the hypothesis (first proposed in 1957) that the different globin chains within a single organism could also be traced to a common ancestral protein.Zuckerkandl, \\"On the Molecular Evolutionary Clock\\", pp. 34-35 Between 1962 and 1965, Pauling and Zuckerkandl refined and elaborated this idea, which they dubbed the molecular clock, and Emil L. Smith and Emanuel Margoliash expanded the analysis to cytochrome c. Early molecular clock calculations agreed fairly well with established divergence times based on paleontological evidence. However, the essential idea of the molecular clock‚Äîthat individual proteins evolve at a regular rate independent of a species' morphological evolution‚Äîwas extremely provocative (as Pauling and Zuckerkandl intended it to be).Dietrich, \\"Paradox and Persuasion\\", pp. 91-94  The \\"molecular wars\\"  From the early 1960s, molecular biology was increasingly seen as a threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists‚Äîparticularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky and G. G. Simpson, three of the founders of the modern evolutionary synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s‚Äîwere extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. Molecular evolution in general‚Äîand the molecular clock in particular‚Äîoffered little basis for exploring evolutionary causation. According to the molecular clock hypothesis, proteins evolved essentially independently of the environmentally determined forces of selection; this was sharply at odds with the panselectionism prevalent at the time. Moreover, Pauling, Zuckerkandl, and other molecular biologists were increasingly bold in asserting the significance of \\"informational macromolecules\\" (DNA, RNA and proteins) for all biological processes, including evolution.Dietrich, \\"Paradox and Persuasion\\", pp. 94-100 The struggle between evolutionary biologists and molecular biologists‚Äîwith each group holding up their discipline as the center of biology as a whole‚Äîwas later dubbed the \\"molecular wars\\" by Edward O. Wilson, who experienced firsthand the domination of his biology department by young molecular biologists in the late 1950s and the 1960s.Wilson, Naturalist, pp. 219-237 In 1961, Mayr began arguing for a clear distinction between functional biology (which considered proximate causes and asked \\"how\\" questions) and evolutionary biology (which considered ultimate causes and asked \\"why\\" questions)Mayr's first published argument for the proximate/ultimate distinction was: He argued that both disciplines and individual scientists could be classified on either the functional or evolutionary side, and that the two approaches to biology were complementary. Mayr, Dobzhansky, Simpson and others used this distinction to argue for the continued relevance of organismal biology, which was rapidly losing ground to molecular biology and related disciplines in the competition for funding and university support.Hagen, \\"Naturalists, Molecular Biologists, and the Challenges of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 333-335 It was in that context that Dobzhansky first published his famous statement, \\"nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\\", in a 1964 paper affirming the importance of organismal biology in the face of the molecular threat; Dobzhansky characterized the molecular disciplines as \\"Cartesian\\" (reductionist) and organismal disciplines as \\"Darwinian\\".Dietrich, \\"Paradox and Persuation\\", pp. 100-103. Dobzhansky's famous phrase appears in the first page of: Mayr and Simpson attended many of the early conferences where molecular evolution was discussed, critiquing what they saw as the overly simplistic approaches of the molecular clock. The molecular clock, based on uniform rates of genetic change driven by random mutations and drift, seemed incompatible with the varying rates of evolution and environmentally-driven adaptive processes (such as adaptive radiation) that were among the key developments of the evolutionary synthesis. At the 1962 Wenner-Gren conference, the 1964 Colloquium on the Evolution of Blood Proteins in Bruges, Belgium, and the 1964 Conference on Evolving Genes and Proteins at Rutgers University, they engaged directly with the molecular biologists and biochemists, hoping to maintain the central place of Darwinian explanations in evolution as its study spread to new fields.Dietrich, \\"Paradox and Persuation\\", pp. 95-98; Hagen, \\"Naturalists, Molecular Biologists, and the Challenges of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 330-332 = Gene-centered view of evolution = Though not directly related to molecular evolution, the mid-1960s also saw the rise of the gene-centered view of evolution, spurred by George C. Williams's Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966). Debate over units of selection, particularly the controversy over group selection, led to increased focus on individual genes (rather than whole organisms or populations) as the theoretical basis for evolution. However, the increased focus on genes did not mean a focus on molecular evolution; in fact, the adaptationism promoted by Williams and other evolutionary theories further marginalized the apparently non-adaptive changes studied by molecular evolutionists.  The neutral theory of molecular evolution  The intellectual threat of molecular evolution became more explicit in 1968, when Motoo Kimura introduced the neutral theory of molecular evolution.Motoo Kimura, [Evolutionary Rate at the Molecular Level\\", Nature, Vol. 217 (1968), pp. 624-626 Based on the available molecular clock studies (of hemoglobin from a wide variety of mammals, cytochrome c from mammals and birds, and triosephosphate dehydrogenase from rabbits and cows), Kimura (assisted by Tomoko Ohta) calculated an average rate of DNA substitution of one base pair change per 300 base pairs (encoding 100 amino acids) per 28 million years. For mammal genomes, this indicated a substitution rate of one every 1.8 years, which would produce an unsustainably high substitution load unless the preponderance of substitutions was selectively neutral. Kimura argued that neutral mutations occur very frequently, a conclusion compatible with the results of the electrophoretic studies of protein heterozygosity. Kimura also applied his earlier mathematical work on genetic drift to explain how neutral mutations could come to fixation, even in the absence of natural selection; he soon convinced James F. Crow of the potential power of neutral alleles and genetic drift as well.Dietrich, \\"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 46-50 Kimura's theory‚Äîdescribed only briefly in a letter to Nature‚Äîwas followed shortly after with a more substantial analysis by Jack L. King and Thomas H. Jukes‚Äîwho titled their first paper on the subject \\"non-Darwinian evolution\\". Though King and Jukes produced much lower estimates of substitution rates and the resulting genetic load in the case of non-neutral changes, they agreed that neutral mutations driven by genetic drift were both real and significant. The fairly constant rates of evolution observed for individual proteins was not easily explained without invoking neutral substitutions (though G. G. Simpson and Emil Smith had tried). Jukes and King also found a strong correlation between the frequency of amino acids and the number of different codons encoding each amino acid. This pointed to substitutions in protein sequences as being largely the product of random genetic drift.Dietrich, \\"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 50-54 King and Jukes' paper, especially with the provocative title, was seen as a direct challenge to mainstream neo-Darwinism, and it brought molecular evolution and the neutral theory to the center of evolutionary biology. It provided a mechanism for the molecular clock and a theoretical basis for exploring deeper issues of molecular evolution, such as the relationship between rate of evolution and functional importance. The rise of the neutral theory marked synthesis of evolutionary biology and molecular biology‚Äîthough an incomplete one.Dietrich, \\"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 54, 57-58 With their work on firmer theoretical footing, in 1971 Emile Zuckerkandl and other molecular evolutionists founded the Journal of Molecular Evolution. = The neutralist-selectionist debate and near-neutrality = The critical responses to the neutral theory that soon appeared marked the beginning of the neutralist-selectionist debate. In short, selectionists viewed natural selection as the primary or only cause of evolution, even at the molecular level, while neutralists held that neutral mutations were widespread and that genetic drift was a crucial factor in the evolution of proteins. Kimura became the most prominent defender of the neutral theory‚Äîwhich would be his main focus for the rest of his career. With Ohta, he refocused his arguments on the rate at which drift could fix new mutations in finite populations, the significance of constant protein evolution rates, and the functional constraints on protein evolution that biochemists and molecular biologists had described. Though Kimura had initially developed the neutral theory partly as an outgrowth of the classical position within the classical/balance controversy (predicting high genetic load as a consequence of non-neutral mutations), he gradually deemphasized his original argument that segregational load would be impossibly high without neutral mutations (which many selectionists, and even fellow neutralists King and Jukes, rejected).Dietrich, \\"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution\\", pp. 54-55 From the 1970s through the early 1980s, both selectionists and neutralists could explain the observed high levels of heterozygosity in natural populations, by assuming different values for unknown parameters. Early in the debate, Kimura's student Tomoko Ohta focused on the interaction between natural selection and genetic drift, which was significant for mutations that were not strictly neutral, but nearly so. In such cases, selection would compete with drift: most slightly deleterious mutations would be eliminated by natural selection or chance; some would move to fixation through drift. The behavior of this type of mutation, described by an equation that combined the mathematics of the neutral theory with classical models, became the basis of Ohta's nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution.Ohta, \\"The current significance and standing of neutral and nearly neutral theories\\", pp. 673-674 In 1973, Ohta published a short letter in Nature suggesting that a wide variety of molecular evidence supported the theory that most mutation events at the molecular level are slightly deleterious rather than strictly neutral. Molecular evolutionists were finding that while rates of protein evolution (consistent with the molecular clock) were fairly independent of generation time, rates of noncoding DNA divergence were inversely proportional to generation time. Noting that population size is generally inversely proportional to generation time, Tomoko Ohta proposed that most amino acid substitutions are slightly deleterious while noncoding DNA substitutions are more neutral. In this case, the faster rate of neutral evolution in proteins expected in small populations (due to genetic drift) is offset by longer generation times (and vice versa), but in large populations with short generation times, noncoding DNA evolves faster while protein evolution is retarded by selection (which is more significant than drift for large populations)., pp 130-131 Between then and the early 1990s, many studies of molecular evolution used a \\"shift model\\" in which the negative effect on the fitness of a population due to deleterious mutations shifts back to an original value when a mutation reaches fixation. In the early 1990s, Ohta developed a \\"fixed model\\" that included both beneficial and deleterious mutations, so that no artificial \\"shift\\" of overall population fitness was necessary.Ohta and Gillispie, \\"Development of Neutral and Nearly Neutral Theories\\", pp. 135-136 According to Ohta, however, the nearly neutral theory largely fell out of favor in the late 1980s, because of the mathematically simpler neutral theory for the widespread molecular systematics research that flourished after the advent of rapid DNA sequencing. As more detailed systematics studies started to compare the evolution of genome regions subject to strong selection versus weaker selection in the 1990s, the nearly neutral theory and the interaction between selection and drift have once again become an important focus of research.Ohta, \\"The current significance and standing of neutral and nearly neutral theories\\", p. 674  Microbial phylogeny  While early work in molecular evolution focused on readily sequenced proteins and relatively recent evolutionary history, by the late 1960s some molecular biologists were pushing further toward the base of the tree of life by studying highly conserved nucleic acid sequences. Carl Woese, a molecular biologist whose earlier work was on the genetic code and its origin, began using small subunit ribosomal RNA to reclassify bacteria by genetic (rather than morphological) similarity. Work proceeded slowly at first, but accelerated as new sequencing methods were developed in the 1970s and 1980s. By 1977, Woese and George Fox announced that some bacteria, such as methanogens, lacked the rRNA units that Woese's phylogenetic studies were based on; they argued that these organisms were actually distinct enough from conventional bacteria and the so-called higher organisms to form their own kingdom, which they called archaebacteria. Though controversial at first (and challenged again in the late 1990s), Woese's work became the basis of the modern three-domain system of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (replacing the five-domain system that had emerged in the 1960s).Sapp, Genesis, pp. 224-228 Work on microbial phylogeny also brought molecular evolution closer to cell biology and origin of life research. The differences between archaea pointed to the importance of RNA in the early history of life. In his work with the genetic code, Woese had suggested RNA-based life had preceded the current forms of DNA-based life, as had several others before him‚Äîan idea that Walter Gilbert would later call the \\"RNA world\\". In many cases, genomics research in the 1990s produced phylogenies contradicting the rRNA-based results, leading to the recognition of widespread lateral gene transfer across distinct taxa. Combined with the probable endosymbiotic origin of organelle-filled eukarya, this pointed to a far more complex picture of the origin and early history of life, one which might not be describable in the traditional terms of common ancestry.Sapp, Genesis, pp. 230-233 References Notes * Dietrich, Michael R. \\"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution.\\" Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 27, No. 1 (Spring 1994), pp 21‚Äì59 * * Crow, James F. \\"Motoo Kimura, 13 November 1924 - 13 November 1994.\\" Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, Vol. 43 (November 1997), pp 254‚Äì265 * * Kreitman, Martin. \\"The neutralist-selectionist debate: The neutral theory is dead.

It is the credit insurance arm of Grupo Catalana Occidente (GCO.MC). Credit insurance, bonding and collections products help protect companies throughout the world from payment risks associated with selling products and services on trade credit. In 2019 the company had revenues of EUR 2 billion. The company is rated ‚ÄòA (excellent) outlook stable‚Äô by A.M. Best and ' A2 outlook negative‚Äô by Moody's. History The roots of Atradius can be found in the 2001 acquisition by German insurer Gerling-Konzern Speziale Kreditversicherung (Gerling Credit) of Dutch insurer Nederlandsche Credietverzekering Maatschappij (NCM). The company was then branded as GERLING NCM. Gerling Credit was established in 1954 as the credit insurance arm of the Gerling- Konzern insurance group of Cologne. In 1962 it opened its first international branch office in Switzerland and was the first private credit insurer to offer export credit protection. NCM had been founded in 1925 with the goal of improving trade for companies in the Netherlands. From 1932 onwards it also became the arm of the Dutch government through which it provided export credit services to Dutch companies. Atradius still performs this function through its affiliate Atradius Dutch State Business. Both Gerling Credit and NCM had made their own acquisitions before their combination, including the acquisition by NCM of the short-term arm of the UK government‚Äôs Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD) in 1991 and private insurers such as Namur Assurances du Cr√©dit S.A., Belgium by Gerling Credit in 1994, both of which have their own histories dating back to the birth of trade credit insurance around 1919. The now international group was renamed Atradius in 2004. In 2008 the group merged with the Spanish credit insurer Cr√©dito y Cauci√≥n, founded in 1929, and subsequently gained an additional foothold in the Spanish speaking world. Atradius forms part of Grupo Catalana Occidente (GCO.MC), one of the leading insurers in Spain and worldwide in credit insurance. The Atradius Group today is the amalgamation of a number of international trade credit insurers and affiliated organisations from around the world. Although now Spanish owned, the holding company Atradius N.V. and its headquarters remain in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Geography  Being an extension of the Taihang mountain range from the Hebei Province, the Western Hills covers approximately 17% of the Beijing municipality, including most of the Mentougou and Fangshan Districts as well as parts of Changping, Haidian, and Shijingshan. The elevation of the Western Hills range is between 100 m to over 1900 m above sea level and is visible from the city on clear days. A mix of deciduous and coniferous forests and highland meadows cover much of the Western Hills. Mountain streams feed into the Yongding and Juma Rivers, which flow through the Western Hills to irrigate the plains of Beijing. Coal is mined in Fangshan and Mentougou Districts. Natural and historical points of interest include river gorges, and hot springs, as well as temples, historic homes, secluded retreats and ancient ruins. Also known as the Western Hills Scenic Area, the area has long been used as a retreat by Chinese scholars, religious men, and members of the government and civil service. Nearest to Beijing's Haidian District is the Fragrant Hills Park. Nearby is the Beijing Botanical Garden and Temple of Azure Clouds. The Wofo Temple, which has a giant reclining Buddha statue, is located on the grounds of the botanical gardens. To the northwest of the Fragrant Hills Park are Jiufeng (Vulture Peak) Forest Park (Èπ´Â≥∞Ê£ÆÊûóÂÖ¨Âõ≠), Dajue Temple, and Fenghuanling (Phoenix Ridge) Scenic Area. South of the Fragrant Hills Park is Badachu (ÂÖ´Â§ßÂ§Ñ; literally \\"eight great sites\\") in Shijingshan District, which is named after eight Buddhist temples and monasteries. The Western Hills of Shijinghan are also home to the Laoshan Mountain Bike Course, where the mountain biking competition of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games was held. Fossils of the Peking Man were discovered in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District. The Western Hills also houses an underground command center of the Chinese military, a secret bunker-like underground facility built with the assistance of the USSR in the 1950s, which now serves a purpose similar to the United States Military's Pentagon. Mao Zedong briefly lived in the Western Hills, and the Politburo of the Communist Party of China retreated there briefly in 1989.  Western Hills Group  The Kuomintang (KMT) also had a secret group named Western Hills, established in 1925. Revolutionary Sun Yat- sen's coffin was kept there, with the group's members being Buddhist, believing that the presence of Sun Yat-sen's body could bless them. The group had a political goal of ousting the Communist Left, headed by Mikhail Borodin, from the KMT.Spense, The Search for Modern China, p.326  See also  *Geography of Beijing *10 spirits from Western Hills (Ë•øÂ±±ÂçÅÊàæ) Taoism stories *Xishan Society  References   External links  *Western Hills page *Article about the geology of the Western Hills Category:Landforms of Beijing Category:Mountains of Beijing Category:North China Plain Category:Hills of China ","title":"Western Hills"},{"id":"11863493","text":"Tam√°s Juh√°r (born 20 November 1972) is a former Hungarian international defender.

The dale is the valley of the River Dee, but takes its name from the village of Dent. The dale runs east to west starting at Dent Head which is the location of a railway viaduct on the Settle-Carlisle Line. Dentdale is one of the few of the Yorkshire Dales that drain westwards towards the Irish Sea.  History  Dentdale was first settled in the 10th century when Norse invaders first entered the dale. The dale was also known to the Romans although there is no evidence of settlement during that period. The dale was one of the last of the Yorkshire Dales to be Enclosed in 1859. The typical occupations in the dale were farming and worsted related. Several mills used the fast flowing waters of the River Dee to supply power to the mills. At least one of these was converted to the Dent Marble industry by 1810. Whilst fishing on the Dee at Dentdale in the 1840s, William Armstrong saw a waterwheel in action, supplying power to a marble quarry. It struck Armstrong that much of the available power was being wasted and it inspired him to design a successful hydraulic engine which began the accumulation of his wealth and industrial empire. Dentdale was originally in the Ewecross Wapentake of the West Riding of Yorkshire, but was transferred to Cumbria in 1974. Settlements Dent village is the main shopping and social centre of the dale. There are two other major villages; Dent Head and Gawthrop. Additionally there are two hamlets at the top of the dale - Cowgill (where Dent Station is located) and Stone House. It has been noted that it is increasingly difficult for young people and family groups to stay in the dale as housing becomes more unaffordable. There are over 200 listed buildings and structures in Dentdale which include the railway viaducts, bridges, barns, farmhouse, mileposts and even telephone boxes. Only one structure is Grade I listed, that of the Church of St Andrew in Dent. Transport A steam train on the Arten Gill viaduct above Stonehouse The famous Settle-Carlisle Line passes across the eastern edge of the dale being carried over the becks that feed the River Dee on Dent Head Viaduct and over Artengill Beck on Arten Gill Viaduct.Arten Gill Viaduct is the spelling from the railway even though the water below is Artengill. The walking route of the Dales Way crosses through the dale in a rough east/west axis. The route and the seclusion of the dale make it popular with walkers and lovers of The Dales. National Cycle route 68 (also known as the Pennine Cycleway) that runs from Derbyshire to Berwick-upon-Tweed passes through the dale. The C5101 road runs through the dale from the nearest main road at Sedbergh (the A683 and A684) to Newby Head Moss, east of the dale head, where it meets the B6255 Hawes to Ingleton road. Western Dales Bus operate a year round Saturday and summer Sunday service between Dent station and Sedbergh with stops en route.  Geology  The Dent Fault cuts across the valley close to the village of Gawthrop, marking a geological boundary between the Carboniferous Limestone of Deepdale and the Craven Dales to the south and the older Silurian and Ordovician rocks of the Howgill Fells to the north. The Upper Dentdale Cave System, which is east of Dent, was recognized as a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1998. The cave system extends for beneath the valley floor under the River Dee and is notable for providing a unique insight into how caves are formed in valley floors. Dent Marble was quarried and polished in Dentdale between 1760 and 1909. Both the viaducts that carry the Settle-Carlisle line over the dale are constructed from Dent Marble. The opening of the railway afforded the opportunity to export the marble out of the dale for the first time. The stone is not actually marble, it is a highly polished form of Black Limestone.

When it opened in 1985, it was called the UK's first multiplex cinema although the UK had introduced multi-screen cinemas in 1930 and had been increasing the number of screens in cinemas ever since. The front part of the building has a distinctive mirrored crystal ziggurat shape, framed by external steel beams at each corner, joined at the apex. Originally it had red neon lights connecting the apexes at each side, so that it looked like a pyramid at night. In May 2012, the building's owners Hammerson announced proposals to demolish the building and replace it with a retail-based development.MK News, Plans to demolish The Point go on display. 25 May 2012 On 6 March 2014, Milton Keynes Council voted to approve the application.Milton Keynes The Point demolition and development approved - BBC Beds, Herts and Bucks, 6 March 2014 On 26 February 2015, the Odeon cinema to the rear of the building closed, in preparation for the demolition. Historic England had refused to recommend the building for listed status. Facilities , the Point houses: *Joint Civil Aid Corps - adult/youth charity based on emergency services support have their HQ on the ground floor (since September 2015) *The Point Kiosk The Point previously housed: *Odeon cinema (closed 26 February 2015, moved to MK1 Shopping & Leisure Park in Denbigh) *Buzz Bingo (located underneath, closed 20 March 2020 due to UK Government restrictions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, announced on 15 July 2020 that it will not reopen) The Point cinema was also previously operated by the following companies: *AMC Theatres (1985-1989) *UCI (1989-2003) *easyCinema (2003-2006, building was leased on agreement with UCI, who continued to serve as landlords) Gala Bingo previously operated the bingo hall until September 2018, when it's UK bingo hall arm was rebranded as Buzz Bingo. History In the 1980s, cinema audiences were in decline nationally, due among other reasons to high ticket prices, TV channels and video recorders. Smaller cinemas were closing down as they were no longer economic to operate. The Point opened in 1985 and included a 10-screen multiplex cinema, referred to as the UK's first multiplex,JANUARIUS, M., \\"Multiplexes multiply\\" Leisure Management August 1991, pp.33-34 although the UK had introduced multi-screen cinemas in 1930. The first company to run the cinema was AMC Theatres in conjunction with Milton Keynes Entertainment Corporation (MKEC). After opening similar multiplexes across the country, in 1989, AMC sold up its UK business to UCI. The cinema was still run in part by MKEC who took the profits from the ticket sales while UCI had the profits from the concession stands. The venue was an instant success and its opening caused, at least partially, the closure of the traditional cinemas in Bletchley and Newport Pagnell. In 1991, it hosted a royal premi√®re of Harrison Ford's Presumed Innocent and was attended by Sarah, Duchess of York. The pyramid section of the Point on opening housed The Brasserie, The Croc Bar, a games arcade and a nightclub, as well as a Bingo hall (originally Gala Bingo, then Buzz Bingo after 2018) in the basement. There was a small newsagents outside the main entrance. In 1995, the owners of The Point refurbished the building and added a pizza restaurant (Deep Pan Pizza, later The Fresh Pizza Company), a health club and a bar/nightclub (Oasis, later Nexus). The opening of Xscape in 2000 was to mark the beginning of the decline of The Point's fortunes. Xscape featured a more lucrative, state-of-the-art 16 screen multiplex, operated by Cineworld. With the two cinemas virtually in close proximity to one another, it soon became apparent that The Point just couldn't compete. Xscape quickly took the vast majority of The Point's cinemagoers, and in 2003, UCI abruptly left Milton Keynes, deciding to rent out the cinema part of the building in order to continue to honour its lease with the complex's owners. =easyCinema= The cinema was rented out to the easyGroup, renaming the cinema as easyCinema.com. The ticket pricing was based on the easyJet model with low headline prices (from 20p) for early bookers, then increasing according to demand. The foyer's popcorn, drinks and sweet stands were originally removed and visitors were encouraged to bring their own food. It showed films that had just recently finished their prime location runs and it did not rely on fixed showtimes. The business plan assumed that the operators could negotiate a fixed price for films (rather than a percentage per ticket sold), but the studios refused to negotiate on this basis. In 2005, a refurbishment of the foyer saw the reintroduction of concession stands for food and drink, an easyInternetCafe was added, along with an easyPizza pick up point. The cinema and business model however was unsuccessful, and in May 2006 the lease was not renewed and the company handed back the cinema to UCI. =Odeon= By this point, UCI had been taken over by Terra Firma and was merged with rival chain Odeon Cinemas. In May 2006, the site was reopened as an Odeon cinema. Despite the high-profile presence of Odeon, this couldn't halt the continuing decline of visitors. In 2007, both the pizza restaurant and nightclub closed due to a lack of business. These remained empty for many years, before becoming a YMCA funded cafe and a Connexions careers office respectively. By 2009, the illuminated lights on the pyramid no longer lit up at night, signalling how much of a less importance it had become in recent times. Cinema closure and planned demolition In 2012, the Point's owners, Hammerson, proposed plans to restructure the building as a new shopping and leisure complex, and asked for feedback from public in an open consultation. The plans were protested by some, given the building's history. An application to Historic England for the building to be given listed grade II status was rejected on the grounds that it lacks any architectural merit.Why is the UK still knocking down historic cinemas? Justin Parkinson, BBC News Magazine, 21 August 2015 The whole complex has subsequently been slated for demolition. In 2013, Odeon announced plans to relocate to a new, 11-screen complex, complete with MK's first IMAX screen, in Denbigh, opposite Stadium mk. The cinema in the Point closed for the final time on 26 February 2015, nearly 30 years after its opening. Odeon's new cinema, officially known as 'Odeon Milton Keynes Stadium', opened for business the next day.Odeon Milton KeynesCinema Treasures In 2020, mere days before the UK went into full lockdown as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to spread, the Buzz Bingo hall closed, in line with all other hospitality venues across the country. Whilst it was anticipated at the time that it would reopen, in July 2020, it was confirmed that as part of a rescue deal for the chain, 26 Buzz Bingo locations would be closed down permanently, including the Milton Keynes site. This means that 35 years since it first opened, all of The Point's entertainment and hospitality attractions have now closed down for good. The building is now slated for demolition but an exact date for when it will commence has yet to be scheduled.

Also in 1478 he received the title of bishop of Montefiascone and Corneto, which he kept until his death. On 19 July 1482 he was appointed Apostolic Administrator of the diocese of Geneva, during the Sede vacante following the death of Joannes Ludovicus de Sabaudia. p. 158. He was transferred to the diocese of Turin on 24 July 1482, only five days later, when the Bishop of Turin, Jean de Compoys, was transferred to Geneva.Eubel, p. 247. In 1483, he laid the cornerstone for the new cathedral of S. Margherita in Montefiascone, and in his Last Will and Testament in 1501 he left money to continue the work, which had barely reached the level of the main floor of the church at the time of his death.Hans Ost, \\"Santa Margherita in Montefiascone: A Centralized Building Plan of the Roman Quattrocento,\\" The Art Bulletin, Vol. 52, No. 4 (December 1970), pp. 373-389, especially pp. 374-375, 378, 387-388. After Sixtus' death in 1484, he went to Rome to participate in the papal conclave, which elected Pope Innocent VIII. Della Rovere remained in Rome for most of the rest of his life, leaving the diocese of Turin in the hands of his vicars and procurators, including his nephew Giovanni Ludovico della Rovere. In Piedmont, he funded the Collegiate church of Saluzzo and the rebuilding of the Turin Cathedral, as well as a new castle in Vinovo to serve as his residence. In Piazza Scossacavalli, in the Borgo rione of Rome, he commissioned Pinturicchio the decoration (including the Semi-Gods Ceiling) of the Palazzo bearing his name, whose construction he had started in 1480, perhaps under design by Baccio Pontelli. He died in Rome on 22 April 1501, having made his Last Will and Testament earlier on the same day, before lunch.Eubel, p. 18, no. 23; p. 55, no. 639. The difference in date of death between 22 April and 23 April occurs because of the working of the 16th century Roman calendar, in which the day began at sunset. Della Rovere died two hours after sunset, which would have been 23 April at the time, but which in the modern calendar was still 22 April. He is now buried in the Turin Cathedral.

It comprises the main settlements of Hawkswick, Arncliffe, Litton, Foxup and Halton Gill, and farmhouses that date from the 17th century. The main waterway in the dale is the River Skirfare which is fed by many small gills and becks. The dale, first recorded by name as Littundale in 1198, is one of the few dales named from its main settlement rather than its river (Wensleydale is the best known example). Historically the dale was also known as Amerdale. The village of Arncliffe was the original setting for the TV series Emmerdale, which is believed to take its name from Amerdale. Geography Littondale is a side dale to the west of Wharfedale and follows the River Skirfare. The nature of the dale and its characteristic smooth form was the result of many ice ages, especially the one 20,000 years ago. As the glacier for that age receded it left retreat moraine, an example of which can be found at Skirfare Bridge. Like neighbouring Wharfedale, Littondale comprises mainly Great Scar Limestone and Yoredale rock. The dale has a number of shake holes and sink-holes that lead to cave systems such as at Boreham Cave. At the head of the dale is Pen-y-ghent, one of the Yorkshire Three Peaks. A narrow road leads up the dale from the B6160 near Kilnsey as far as Foxup. Two minor roads lead out of the dale to the south and west, one from Arncliffe to Malham and one from Halton Gill past Pen-y-Ghent to Stainforth in Ribblesdale. History Littondale is rich in Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements, and has been a sheltered fertile valley for 5,000 years or more. Anglian cultivation terraces (lynchets) can be seen in the valley. After the Conquest, the Normans turned it into a hunting chase before the land was granted to the monks of Fountains Abbey in the 13th century, and became extensively used for sheep farming. All of Littondale was historically in the ancient parish of Arncliffe in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1866 it was divided into the civil parishes of Hawkswick, Arncliffe, Litton and Halton GillVision of Britain website, and in 1974 became part of the district of Craven in the new county of North Yorkshire. Settlements Hawkswick is the first settlement reached travelling from the B6160. The name is derived from the Middle English Hauk meaning someone who trained Hawks and wick, meaning dairy farm. Arncliffe is the second, and largest, settlement reached travelling from the B6160, lies at the confluence of Cowside Beck and the River Skirfare. The name derives from the Old English, earna-clif, meaning eagles cliff. It is now a conservation area and is centred on its village green and has one public house. The church was built in the 16th and 18th centuries to replace the stone 11th century building, which probably superseded a wooden Anglo-Saxon church. Litton is the third settlement reached travelling from the B6160. The name has the meaning village on a roaring stream. Halton Gill is the fourth settlement reached travelling from the B6160. The name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon haugh meaning Valley and tun meaning farm. Gill is a derivation of the Olde Norse 'gil', meaning ravine, therefore the whole name means valley farm by the ravine. Foxup is the last settlement reached travelling from the B6160. The name means fox valley. Governance Littondale lies within the Mid Craven electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. The county councillor in 2020 is Gill Quinn of the Conservative Party. Littondale lies within the Craven District Council ward of Upper Wharfedale and as of 2020 is represented by Sue Metcalfe of the Conservative Party. There are four civil parishes in Littondale. Arncliffe has a parish council. Hawkswick, Litton and Halton Gill have parish meetings but no parish councils. Gallery Littondale - geograph.org.uk - 591156.jpgLittondale.

Devereux is a co-founder and the managing editor of the academic publication Time & Mind ‚Äì the Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture, a research associate with the Royal College of Art (2007-2013), and a Research Fellow with the International Consciousness Research Laboratories (ICRL) group at Princeton University. Paul Devereux' work primarily deals with archaeological themes, especially archaeoacoustics (the study of sound at archaeological sites), the anthropology of consciousness (ancient and pre-modern worldviews), ecopsychology, unusual geophysical phenomena, and consciousness studies, spanning the range from academic to popular. He has written or co-written 28 books since 1979. He originated two Channel 4 (UK) television documentaries. Biography Paul Devereux grew up in Leicester. He painted and studied at the Ravensbourne College of Art and Design in London. With a preference for abstract expressionism, he found increasing inspiration in the geometry and ground plans of ancient sites. He admits to experiencing LSD and mescaline in college, and having at least one profound epiphany under the influence in 1966. He also witnessed, along with all the students on campus, the passage of a UFO in broad daylight in 1967.Paul Devereux on LSD, leys, The RCA, and Places of Power, Artconwall.org Throughout the 1970s, he exhibited his work that a critic described as ¬´a collision between Op art and archaeology¬ª. He was also a teacher, eventually teaching an evening class in Kensington called Earth mysteries. Interested in researching the ideas behind ley lines, he took over as editor of The Ley Hunter magazine in 1976. Work =Ley lines= Devereux is indelibly associated with ‚Äúleys\\", or ‚Äúley lines\\". In 1976, Paul Devereux took over as editor of the magazine The Ley Hunter. His first order was an article on the mystical power of ley lines, but none of the writers could provide concrete documentation on the matter. According to him, Alfred Watkins' alignments ¬´were really just chance alignments of points on maps. This can be demonstrated quite conclusively¬ª. Paul Devereux' work on ley lines was mainly focused on debunking the mystical properties falsely attributed to them. He argues that fake information about ley lines started in 1936 with Dion Fortune's book Goat-Foot God where the author introduced the idea that ley lines have mystic power. He also mentions Aim√© Michel's 1958 book, Flying Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery, which stipulates that UFOs followed straight specific lines, an idea that ex-RAF pilot Tony Wedd later linked to Alfred Watkins' The Old Straight Track. This idea then bloomed in the psychedelic movement of the 1960s and became a pillar of the New Age philosophies.Jeff Belanger, Ley Lines, Old Straight Tracks, and Earth Energies, Ghostvillage.com, 13 December 2003 About the Nazca Lines, Paul Devereux argues that they are walking tracks, and that their pattern mainly reveal the religious beliefs of the Kogi Indians around sacred roads. In his 2003 book Fairy Paths & Spirit Roads, Paul Devereux studied many ley lines worldwide and concluded that these linear features are essentially ¬´paths of spirits¬ª. He led the Dragon Project for 10 years and admitted that there are places of high radiation where some participants experienced powerful and vivid hallucinatory episodes of spirit-like visits. =Dragon Project= Devereux is the director of the Dragon Project Trust, which in the past used scientific measuring instruments as well as primary sensing (using dowsers and self-proclaimed psychics) to test modern rumours and traditional folklore of there being \\"energies\\" at sacred places. Between 1990 and 2000, it ran an ambitious ancient sites dream research programme (a modern, updated research version of ancient \\"temple sleep\\" practices).Dragon Project Trust =UFOs= Devereux states that he suspects a small percentage of unexplained aerial phenomena are literally unexplained flying objects, their nature currently unknown. He strongly doubts they are extraterrestrial craft but rather exotic natural phenomena ‚Äì probably some form of plasma with extraordinary properties. He coined the term ‚Äúearth lights\\" to label these type of phenomena. Most UFO sighting reports he thinks result from misperceptions of astronomical objects, atmospheric effects such as mirages, or aircraft and other mundane objects, or downright hoaxes. Some reports, he feels, also stem from psycho-social causes. Devereux states that he became interested in unexplained aerial phenomena because of a bizarre sighting of his own in 1967.Finlo Rohrer, Saucers in the sky, www.bbc.co.uk, 4 July 2007 Devereux has written three books on the topic, Earth Lights, and, in particular, Earth Lights Revelation, and has co-authored (with Peter Brookesmith) a major work, UFOs and Ufology, and has also written numerous articles on earth lights and given several lectures (including at the Dana Centre, Science Museum, London) on the subject. =Archaeoacoustics= In 2014, the Landscape and Perception Project led by Paul Devereux led research on the rocks in Stonehenge and concluded they were resonant rocks that work like a giant prehistoric glockenspiel. This theory would explain why the rocks were brought from 200 miles away from the site.Stonehenge bluestones had acoustic properties, study shows, www.bbc.com, 3 March 2014 Other research led him to the observation that cairns on burial grounds resonate at 111 Hz (sacred resonance).

World War II and entry into the CIA During the war he served in the Pacific, participating in battles such as Guadalcanal. During the Solomon Islands campaign he suffered a severe wound as the result of being shot in the right leg by a Japanese sniper while he was helping to move his fellow soldiers who were wounded out of danger. Although the military doctors told him that his leg would have to be amputated as part of his treatment, Gougelmann was intent on returning to service and therefore refused to give his permission for the doctors to proceed with the amputation. He wound up keeping his leg but as a result his convalescence lasted for two years. During this time he was decorated with a Purple Heart in recognition of his having sustained the injury in combat. By the time he had recovered and was returned to active duty the war was drawing to a close. Regardless, Gougelmann remained in the Corps until his honorable discharge in 1949. Wanting to continue in service to his country, Gougelmann joined the then nascent Central Intelligence Agency, which had been created from the embattled Central Intelligence Group (\\"CIG\\") following the National Security Act of 1947 which Truman had signed into law only two years earlier. Although the CIG had a record of difficulty with attracting \\"the best and the brightest,\\" the newly formed CIA had no such difficulties in its early years. It was in fact a magnet for many of the nation's privileged youth who were recent graduates of top educational institutions, such as Ivy League universities. It was viewed as presenting a unique set of challenges, interesting work, and the opportunity to serve the country at the beginning of the Cold War. Cold War service Gougelmann's first assignment was to Korea during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. There he participated in covert operations, including helping agents to infiltrate the North. His experience in covert operations was subsequently put to use in the CIA's attempts to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba during the mid/late 1950s and early 1960s. Gougelmann may have been involved in the botched Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, although this is not confirmed. Following the CIA's failed attempts to remove Castro from power, and the public relations problems that it caused for the Kennedy Administration, the CIA's role with respect to Cuba was severely curtailed as Cold War's active theater moved from Cuba back to other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia. Gougelmann's assignments during that time took him to Afghanistan as well as various locations in Europe. Vietnam In 1962 Gougelmann was assigned to South Vietnam. He continued to specialize in covert paramilitary operations work, coordinating Nasty boat raids against the North using Taiwanese nationals posing as civilians as part of Operation 34A. Following the conclusion of the raiding program, Gougelmann was assigned to the CIA's Saigon Station where his knowledge of covert operations methods was put to use in the domestic counter-intelligence work of a local governmental entity. Being settled in a location for the first time in a long while, Gougelmann began a family life there with a local woman. Gougelmann retired from the CIA in 1972 and had departed South Vietnam before the Fall of Saigon and was living in Bangkok, Thailand as a civilian. When his family could not be evacuated from Saigon prior to the impending North Vietnamese victory, he returned on his own. Once there, he established contact with his family, but had difficulty finding a way to get them out of the country. In the environment of that time, his continued presence was very unsafe, as an American CIA Officer would be a prime catch for the triumphant North Vietnamese. Although he tried his best to hide, including stuffing himself into an alcove behind a refrigerator, he was eventually found during a search conducted by the police on the advice of a local Vietnamese. Capture, interrogation and torture Gougelmann was immediately taken into custody and kept in the main prison of the area, Ch√≠ H√≤a Prison. A French reporter had witnessed his arrest and he was reportedly seen by Vietnamese prisoners in Wing ED, where he was being kept. The Vietnamese government denied that they were holding him, despite being presented with evidence to the contrary. Details of his imprisonment are limited and unconfirmed, and his treatment by the Vietnamese during his captivity is based on examination of the evidence after the fact. He was removed from the prison several times to be taken for interrogation, and government officials believe he was tortured during this time. The Vietnamese government continued to deny that they were holding Gougelmann for the remainder of 1975 and 1976, but in 1977 they released his remains to U.S. authorities. Postmortem examination by U.S. government officials indicated that Gougelmann was tortured during his captivity, as evidenced primarily by a very large number of broken bones which appeared to have been broken and re-broken after healing. According to Bien Hoa CIA spymaster Orrin DeForrest in his book Slow Burn: The Rise and Bitter Fall of American Intelligence in Vietnam, Gougelmann had been retired and living in Saigon since 1973 with his Vietnamese wife. DeForrest stated: After death Before leaving Bangkok for Vietnam, Gougelmann asked a friend to try to get his family, including his youngest son, Edward who was born after Gougelmann's's arrest, out of Vietnam and to America if he ran afoul of the Vietnamese authorities. After contacting American government officials in the CIA, Congress, and other high-ranking government offices, the friend succeeded in obtaining visas which allowed the family to emigrate to the United States. After Gougelmann's remains were returned to the United States, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His grave is located next to that of Francis Gary Powers. Though not serving in an official capacity at the time of his arrest in 1975, the CIA decided that Gougelmann's death was a result of the official CIA activity that he had been involved with previously in Vietnam and granted him a star on the CIA Memorial Wall at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia which commemorates those CIA staff who died in the line of duty.

Initially it had a shelter shed, loading bank and crossing loop and was used to cross trains until the introduction of signalling at the larger Wairarapa stations. In its early years several sawmills flourished in the vicinity, with timber making up a bulk of the goods loaded. The crossing loop and private sawmill sidings have been removed. In 2006, with the introduction of the SW-class carriages for the Wairarapa Connection service looming, it was proposed that this station be closed due to its low patronage and the cost involved in building a platform so that passengers could safely board and disembark from the new carriages. After vocal opposition from local residents, this proposal was rescinded. This station was temporarily closed from 17 May 2007 to 4 June 2007 to enable construction work to proceed on preparations for the new carriages.

Flowers were tossed into the grave by loved ones, and the man picks one of these up and muses that there is something terrible about a flower, and about a child, who smiled during the funeral. He then begins to recall memories of his fianc√©e, starting a week prior to the funeral, suggesting that the death occurred suddenly. The man remembers her laughing at him as he tried to explain how she had made a better man of him. He briefly tells himself that none of this is real, that he might wake up and find it was all a dream. Then he goes back to thinking about the times they shared, waiting for Spring, most likely when their wedding date was set. He remembers sight-seeing with her, looking at the lion statues in Trafalgar Square, and the seagulls along the river, presumably the Thames. His fianc√©e seems to have been an adherent of folk beliefs, as she believed the seagulls to be the spirits of sea captains and the square's bronze lion sculptures to be watching over London. There is a legend that the lions will come to life when Big Ben strikes 13 times. This is probably the \\"bell\\" to which she refers. The man returns to the present as he recalls how they missed their wedding day by a month. He begins to imagine what their honeymoon would have been like, musing that she had never kissed him back. He remembers how he let her go and now would do anything, no matter how damning, to have her back. He remembers being a little boy at Christmas time, how happy he was and how he used to pray for God to keep him safe at night, but now he is afraid and he has decided to stay with his fianc√©e in the graveyard, so she can help him sleep. He doesn't want to go home without her as he would be lonely. But here, in the graveyard, there are plenty of souls, including hers, to keep him company. So he stays there, imagining all of the people lying under their tombstones covered with flowers, and imagines that if they were all dug up again, they would not be dead.  Analysis  The rhyme scheme of the poem starts off with a fairly regular ABAB and changes with the 5th verse, which is also where the narrator's tone changes as he tries to deny that any of this is really happening. The pattern returns once he calms down again, though only briefly. It seems to vary wildly when he reminiscences about his lost lover. The poem moves through the stages of grief, and ends with the speaker unable to leave the cemetery. This suggests that he has not come to acceptance yet. There does not seem to be a lot of information about how the poem was interpreted, but many consider it an exploration into the topics of death, loss of faith/madness, and social alienation.

It is the northernmost railway station on the West Rhine Railway in Rhineland- Palatinate.  History  Rolandseck station, 1857 The Bonn‚ÄìCologne Railway Company (') extended its line (later the West Rhine railway) from Cologne to Bonn on 15 February 1844. In 1846, the company had requested permission from the Prussian Government to extend the line to Rolandseck, but had been refused for military reasons. Finally in 1853, the Prussian Cabinet gave it provisional permission to extend the line as far as Rolandseck. The new terminus should be as close as possible to the Rhine, in order to cater for comfortable transfers to steam ships. The supervising engineer for the building of the railway line also produced the sketches for the Rolandseck station, which was set out in such a way that the terminus of the line could hold company meetings, because at this time the Rolandseck area, together with Rolandswerther, was the epitome of Rhineland romanticism. Construction started in 1856 and was finished in 1858. It became the meeting place for society. Queen Victoria of England, Kaiser William, Otto von Bismarck, Heinrich Heine, Ludwig Uhland, Karl Simrock, Brothers Grimm and Friedrich Nietzsche went there, as well as the musicians Johannes Brahms, Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt. Bernhard Shaw wrote above the station and Guillaume Apollinaire wrote some of his early poems here. There were many celebrations and concerts in the old station. Artists studios After World War II, the station was not any longer operated. In 1958 the president of the Deutsche Bundesbahn's Mainz region decided that \\"oversized\\" areas would be demolished and a small reception building would be established. Times changed, however, and in 1964 and Johannes Wasmuth developed a plan for the station as an art gallery and studio. Within a short time the station became a center of cultural life. Hans Arp, Oskar Kokoschka, , G√ºnther Uecker, Gotthard Graubner, Stefan Askenase, Yehudi Menuhin, Martha Argerich, Martin Walser and Marcel Marceau represent some of the people who participated. Only the death of Johannes Wasmuth ended the cultural life of the station.  Arp Museum ‚Äì Rolandseck railway station  After extensive reorganization and rebuilding the station reopened on 22 October 2004 and will include September 2007 the entrance to the new Arp Museum, which is being built above the station in accordance with the plans of the architect Richard Meier. The station building could not be returned to its original condition due to structural changes made at the beginning of the 20th century. The renovation work aimed at restoring the structural condition of the station in 1906 with a veranda and a pale green painted facade. The whitewashed surfaces of the dining room were restored, so that stucco work can be seen once again. The entrance is now in the basement, which along with the ground floor, serve as the exhibition areas. Works by Hans Arp are displayed in the basement and temporary exhibitions are displayed on the ground floor. The dining room and bistro are on the second floor. File:Bahnhof Rolandseck Veranda.jpgFirst floor veranda File:Bahnhof Rolandseck Sockelgeschoss.jpgView from outside into the basement with works by Hans Arp File:Bahnhof Rolandseck Festsaal.jpgDining room File:Tanzgeschmeide.jpgArp: Tanzgeschmeide, museum sculpture A characteristic of the Arp Museums is the exhibition of works by contemporary artists in its functional areas. In keeping with a tradition created by Johannes Wasmuth, works by the British painter Stephen McKenna that include colourful ironical quotations from the history of art were retained in the station's wash rooms and bistro. In the course of the modifications further functional areas of the museum were equipped by various artists: the wash room by Maria Nordman, the bistro by Anton Henning, the library by the Swiss Thomas Huber, and the museum's helicopter landing pad was developed in the style of the Ingold airline project of Swiss artist, Res Ingold (that is the logos, corporate identity, advertising and presentation material of a fictitious airline).  Sculpture banks  The Arp Museum has developed since 2000, in co-operation with the city of Remagen, the sculpture garden along the Rhine bank between Rolandswerth and south of Remagen, on either side of the station.

An old-fashioned wingman, Tregenza is a four-time SANFL premiership player with the Port Adelaide Football Club, but missed out on Adelaide's back-to-back premierships due to persistent soft tissue injuries. SANFL career Tregenza made his debut with Port Adelaide in 1988, playing just 2 games amidst the Magpies' first Premiership success since 1981. 1989 proved to be his breakout year as he performed brilliantly, playing 31 games including Port's demolition of North Adelaide in the Grand Final and finishing second in the Magarey Medal count behind Gilbert McAdam. In 1990 Tregenza once again starred, playing in yet another flag and again finishing second in the Magarey Medal count, this time to teammate Scott Hodges. After his AFL retirement Tregenza returned to play for Port Adelaide in the SANFL, playing in the club's back-to-back Premierships of 1998 and 1999. Tregenza retired at the end of the 2000 season. Tregenza's outstanding service for the club was recognised with the Life Membership in 2005. AFL career Tregenza was originally drafted by Footscray with pick #59 in the 1987 VFL Draft but chose to remain in South Australia. With the formation of the Adelaide Football Club and its entrance in the Australian Football League for season 1991, Tregenza was one of the coveted young stars expected to form the backbone of the club's pioneering years. For years Tregenza remained a valued first teamer before an ACL tear suffered in the Round 2, 1996 victory over Fitzroy marked the turning point of his career.Burtenshaw, D. 'Step Up Or Step Aside', The Advertiser, 30 December 1998. Tregenza played just 19 more times before his AFL retirement in 1999, which was largely due to persistent hamstring injuries. Despite this disappointing end to his AFL career, Tregenza won selection to the Adelaide Football Club Team of the Decade in the wing position'Adelaide Official Team of the Decade 1991-2000' and was awarded Life Membership of the club in 1999.'Adelaide Crows Life Members' In lieu of Tregenza not fulfilling the usual 10 years or 200 games stipulation for Life Membership, the Club's Board recommended that due to 'Outstanding Service' Tregenza, Matthew Liptak, David Pittman and Rod Jameson should be granted the honour. \\"While they have played nine years, and not the 10 as required normally, the board's view is that as foundation squad members, and given their service during the tough times in the establishment of the club, they are worthy recipients of this honor\\", said then CEO Bill Sanders.Rucci, M. 'Four given lifeline', The Advertiser, 2 October 1999. Coaching and cricket Following his retirement from football, Tregenza took up coaching Sacred Heart Old Collegians in the South Australian Amateur League where he guided the club to the 2001 Premiership.'SHOC Football History - 2001 Premiership Year' Following this success he was appointed Reserves coach of Port Adelaide in the SANFL for a number of years.Rucci, M.

The fruit is a green capsule that splits open to reveal the black seeds partly covered with a fleshy scarlet aril against the white inside of the fruit. Ixerba is an endemic of the northern half of the North Island of New Zealand. Common names used in New Zealand are tawari () for the tree and whakou when in flower. It is assigned to the family Strasburgeriaceae.  Description  = Stem and leaves = Tawari is a small tree of up to 10 m high with a spreading crown. The trunk is usually between 2-4 dm in diameter, and covered by a dark to grayish brown bark. Young branches have few flat- lying pale unicellular T-hairs, while the peduncles, pedicels, sepals and petals are thickly covered in such hairs, giving them a felty look. The leaves are alternately positioned along the stem and often almost create a whorl at the end of a growth period, with the bud at the end covered in stout triangular scales. These scales have entire margins fringed with simple single celled hairs. The first leaves to appear when growth recommences are an intermediate series between schales and full leaves. Stipules at the base of the leaf stem are absent. The leaf stalk is stout, fleshy and about 2 cm long. The somewhat fleshy and distinctly leathery simple leaf blades are yellowish to dark green on top and pale green beneath and measure 6-16 √ó 1‚Äì4 cm, are lanceolate to elliptic in shape, while the widest point may be at or beyond midlength, with a pointy tip, and the edges are coarsely serrated. A small gland is present at the tip of each tooth. Young leaves are often reddish and have rolled-in margins. Leaves on young shoots may be relatively narrower. Old leaves discolor to orange or red. = Flowers = Flower buds are formed in March and April and these open from October to the end of December varying according to location and altitude. The inflorescence sits at the end of the branches in an umbel-like panicle that consists of five to fifteen flowers. Each flower is hermaphrodite, starsymmetric, 2¬Ω‚Äî3¬Ω cm in diameter and produces copious amounts of nectar, but apparently does not emit a scent. The five sepals are broadly oval, covered in downy hairs and 5‚Äì6 mm long. The five petals are overlapping in the bud, white, felty, spoon-shaped with a narrow base (or claw). The claw is 1¬Ω-2 cm long and is inserted on a 5-lobed disc. The five stamens extend well beyond the corolla and alternate with the five lobes of the disc at the centre of the flower. The filaments are very long and white. The anthers are connected to the filaments midlength and open in lengthwise slits towards the middle of the flower. Pollen grains have five slits. The nectar is produced by the ledges of the disc, just above the petal inplant. The five styles that rise from the disc are sometimes free from each other at their based and are twisting and fused higher up. = Fruit and seed = The fruit is a leathery capsule, broadly oval in shape. These contain five spaces that split open outwards from the base of the style when the fruit is ripe by April. Each space contains two shiny black seeds that are shaped like a slightly curved tear drop of 6√ó3 mm, and are partly covered by a conspicuous scarlet aril, both of which starkly contrast with the horny white inside of the fruit (or mericarp). Aborted seeds are greyish. The embryo is green. Ixerba has fifty chromosomes (2n = 50).  Taxonomy  Ixerba has been assigned to different families over time. Traditionally it was regarded related to Roussea and Brexia and has been combined with them in the Brexiaceae. These three have been placed in different other famililies, such as the Escalloniaceae, but doubt remained about their proper placement. After genetic analysis showed that Ixerba was not very much related to either Roussea or Brexia, it was placed in the monogeneric family Ixerbaceae. However, further testing revealed that Ixerba was closely related to the New Caledonian genus Strasburgeria and it was assigned to the Strasburgeriaceae by the APG III in 2009. = Phylogeny = Fossil remains of Ixerba have been found from the Middle Miocene. Recent phylogenetic analysis resulted in the following tree. = Etymology = The genus name Ixerba is an anagram of Brexia, a treelet from Madagascar and the coast of East Africa, to which it bears a superficial likeness. The species epithet brexioides means \\"like Brexia\\".  Distribution  Tawari is a species endemic to the North Island of New Zealand, roughly north of a line crossing Taupo. It is said to be widespread from about Kaitaia south to Waitomo, and Te Urewera, including the Tutamoe Ranges, the WaitƒÅkere Ranges, Waipoua Forest, Te Moehau on the Coromandel Peninsula, higher elevations on the Barrier Islands and elsewhere around the Bay of Plenty.  Ecology  Tawari can often be found together with the New Zealand kauri Agathis australis in the understory of the lowland rain forest. It is common in cloud forest up to 700 m too. The species has a preference for shaded or sheltered locations, often in permanently damp soil and near streams. It is locally abundant but mostly individuals are far between. It is common in regenerating forests along with tawheowheo Quintinia serrata. Tawari has a mass flowering strategy, attracting a range of visitors with the abundant nectar it produces. Each flower produces on average 18 Œºl of nectar with an average concentration of 20% brix. Pollination is mainly by birds, however in modified forest where birds a few in number, flower visitation is most frequently by large flies and moths, followed by honey bees, bumblebees, native bees, wasps and beetles. Floral morphology, such as its wide spreading anthers, suggest adaptation to pollination by birds. Seeds capsules develop between January and April each year, and dehisce to reveal up to ten glossy, purple-black seeds that are partly covered by an orange fleshy aril. Seeds are primarily dispersed by birds, with reports including kereru, whitehead, hihi, and kaka.  Use  Tawari is a rich source of nectar, which is often so abundant that bees produce monofloral honey, that is the honey is chiefly made of nectar from tawari flowers. Tawari honey is regularly for sale from food shops in New Zealand. The nectar contains a lot of fructose and much water. The honey may be thin as a consequence, but nonetheless crystallizes quickly. The honey has a light colour and tastes a bit like butterscotch. It contains relatively few pollen, and if at least 20% of the pollen is tawari, it can be marketed as tawari honey. Bark can produce a black dye that is known to be used on flax. MƒÅori people traditionally used the flowers to make necklaces and other adornments to be worn at festivities.  Cultivation  Tawari is known to be very difficult to grow in gardens. It needs a sheltered location, humus-rich soil and good drainage, but the soil should never dry out. The species probably depends on a mycorrhiza, and if planted next to Kapuka Griselinia littoralis, tawari does much better.

It is a large inland depression, marshy in character, with rich flora and fauna. Forty-seven rivers and other waterways flow into the Chalan Beel. As silt builds up in the beel, its size is being reduced. Location and extent Overview map showing Chalan Beel among the main rivers in North Bengal Chalan Beel is an extensive lowland area in the lower Atrai basin, and spreads across Singra and Gurudaspur upazilas on Natore District, Chatmohar, Bhangura and Faridpur upazilas of Pabna District, and Ullahpara, Raiganj and Tarash upazilas of Sirajganj District. It consists of a series of beels connected to one another by various channels to form a continuous water body during the rainy season. Although the beel area expands into a vast water body with dense aquatic vegetation as long as the Jamuna remains flooded during the monsoon months, it dries out in the winter months, leaving only patches of water in the central parts of this zone. Chalan Beel is fast silting up. In the past it covered an area of about 1,085 km¬≤ but was reduced to 368 km¬≤ in 1909, of which only 85 km¬≤ remained underwater throughout the year. It has since shrunk to only 26 km¬≤. History The most important factor dominating the river history in Bengal is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers. It is the silt which has created the land and made it habitable by building it up through the centuries. It is silt which is fertilising the land, but the silt, which has been the most beneficial gift of nature, has also produced most of the river problems now confronting the people of Bengal. Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced them to change course, creating problems for abandoned areas while assisting in developing new areas.Majumdar, S.C., Chief Engineer, Bengal, Rivers of the Bengal Delta, Government of Bengal, 1941, reproduced in Rivers of Bengal, Vol I, 2001, p. 101, published by Education Department, Government of West Bengal. The main volume of water from the Ganges River began flowing through the Padma channel in the sixteenth century. Silt from the Padma helped in building up the southern portion of north Bengal. This is the most plausible explanation for the existence of a depression around Chalan Beel. The Teesta was active in the region until it changed its course in 1787. This territory lies in between the land raised in the north by the Teesta system when it was active and that in the south by the Padma.Majumdar, S.C., p. 46 However, there is another explanation for the creation of the depression. The Padma has been changing its course over the centuries. In Ven den Brouck's map of Bengal, prepared in 1660, the main channel of the Padma is shown as flowing through Faridpur-Bakharganj, but there also is a suggestion of another, possibly earlier channel. This channel runs through Rampur Boalia in Rajshahi, Chalan Beel, Dhaleswari and Buriganga before meeting the Meghna. At that time the Jamuna was virtually non-existent and the Brahmaputra used to flow through its old channel.Roy, Niharranjan, Bangalir Itihas, Adi Parba, , first published 1972, reprint 2005, p. 83, Dey‚Äôs Publishing, 13 Bankim Chatterjee Street, Kolkata, Impact of railways An estimate taken in 1945 found about 47 rivers and other waterways flowed into the Chalan Beel, a watershed of about . In addition to being a crossroads for the many waterways it also served as the origin for the many rivers flowing south or east that eventually meet with the Padma or Jamuna. In the early 1900s, Chalan Beel began to be hemmed in by the construction of the Eastern Bengal Railway main line on the west and the Santahar-Bogra branch line on the north. The natural pattern of the water's drainage channels in this area were disrupted by the obstruction caused by the railway construction since railways in these low lands had to be built on embankments. Flora and fauna The banks of the beel are covered with dense stands of kash, babla, nol, dhol kolmi, simul, and date palm. Seven species of frogs and one species of toad represent the amphibian fauna. Chalan Beel has a total of 34 species of reptiles, including ten turtles and tortoises, nine lizards and various snake species. There are 27 species of mammals from 12 families. Pollution Chalan Beel has experienced the negative effects of pesticide use in the surrounding farmlands. In 2010, Bangladesh Agricultural University research, found pesticide use has increased sixfold since 1982, and the fish population of Chalan Beel has halved in the same period. A 25 kilometre highway constructed on the Beel has divided into two and caused havoc on the fish breeding by disrupting their movement. Commercial overfishing, grill and drag net and other destructive fishing have harmed the fish population.

Modeling She was a model for two years before progressing to a career in film. She stated, \\"I started posing for photographers as a lark, and it was a lot of fun.\\" She had been known as the \\"Ipana Toothpaste Girl\\", due to her work for that product.Katz, Ephraim (1979). The Film Encyclopedia: The Most Comprehensive Encyclopedia of World Cinema in a Single Volume. Perigee Books; , pg. 170.

Kern, written by Stephen Longstreet, and starring Ronald Reagan, Alexis Smith, Zachary Scott, Peggy Knudsen, Patti Brady and Harry Davenport. It was released by Warner Bros. on April 12, 1947. Plot Based on the novel and screenplay by Stephen Longstreet, this film depicts the romance which flowers between a breezy young veterinarian (Ronald Reagan), and a lady who runs a breeding farm (Alexis Smith). The two horse-loving characters appear to be bound for an inevitable love story. And a friend of the vet (Zachary Scott), who also fancies the lady, quite obviously hasn't a chance. But then, in a moment of crisis, when the favourite mare of the lady is at death's door, the vet doesn't respond to her summons. He is off vaccinating a herd of cows which is suddenly and alarmingly threatened with the dreaded anthrax disease. And that, it seems, is an incident which the lady takes very personally: she gives the vet the cold shoulder and throws herself into the arms of his pal. Eventually, things come around when the vet contracts anthrax himself (after pulling the lady's herd of horses out of danger with a new serum he has found) and she realizes that she still loves him and that she has to save him at all costs. So, she gives him the anthrax serum, and luckily he pulls through.

It was selected as a \\"Summer Read\\" by the Richard & Judy Book Club, and was featured on Channel 4's Richard & Judy Show on Wednesday 18 July 2007. Subsequently, it was the 2007 winner of the Summer Read shortlist. It was also chosen for the First Look Book Club on Barnes & Noble before its release in the United States. An edition of the book was published by Allen & Unwin under the title of The Shifting Fog. It sold 63,218 copies in its first week of release in the United Kingdom.  Plot  Ninety-nine-year-old Grace Bradley, a maid at Riverton Manor in the 1920s, has long hidden a terrible secret. A film is being made about a famous incident at Riverton when well-known poet Robbie Hunter shot himself. Contacted by the director, Ursula, as the only surviving person from that night, Grace decides to make a tape for her grandson, Marcus, sharing her secret with him. As a young girl, Grace is sent to work at Riverton, first meeting the grandchildren of Riverton ‚Äì David, Hannah and Emmeline ‚Äì when they come to stay, and immediately feels a connection with them, Hannah in particular. It is later revealed that Grace is a half-sibling to the children. Though she suspects Hannah knows this, Grace does not say anything to her, and their relationship is strengthened by their many unsaid understandings about each other. One Christmas, David brings home a school friend, Robbie Hunter, with whom eleven-year-old Emmeline is infatuated but fifteen-year-old Hannah is less impressed. Nearly ten years later, after David has been killed in WWI, Robbie finds Hannah to return a book she had given her brother. Hannah is living in London and unhappily married to an older businessman, and Robbie provides a glimpse of the life she wanted to have. They fall in love and begin an affair. Emmeline, who has grown into a beautiful woman and one of the Bright Young People, prefers London society and often stays with Hannah, providing Robbie and Hannah the excuse they need to see each other, as Robbie ostensibly calls on Emmeline but is really slipping notes to Hannah with locations and times to meet. Robbie is suffering shell- shock from the war, and wants to run away with Hannah and begin new lives together. She assists in planning their escape to appease him but does not believe they can elope, and is further convinced when her husband announces his plans to relocate them back to Riverton. To celebrate the revival of Riverton, Hannah and her husband plan an extravagant midsummer gala. During the party, Grace goes to her room and finds two letters from Hannah. One addressed to Grace is in shorthand, which Hannah mistakenly believes Grace can read. Grace opens the second letter addressed to Emmeline, a suicide note saying that Hannah will have drowned herself in the lake by the time the letter is read. Grace rushes to find Emmeline, and takes her to the lake. They find Hannah, who passes it off as a game when questioned. As Grace and Emmeline are about to return to the house, Robbie emerges from the newly built summerhouse, carrying a suitcase. Emmeline thinks he has come to see her until it becomes apparent that he and Hannah are in love and running away together. Overcome with jealousy, Emmeline pulls out a handgun and threatens to shoot herself. Hannah wrestles the gun from her as fireworks go off around them, taking Robbie back to his time in the trenches, and he shouts at Hannah to shoot Emmeline before she ruins their plans. As Emmeline and Robbie rush toward her, Hannah shoots Robbie to save her sister. Hearing people approaching, Emmeline takes control, tells Grace to take Hannah's bags up to the house, and announces that Robbie has shot himself. The police find no suspicious circumstances and Emmeline returns to London, continuing to enjoy the high life until she is killed in a car accident. Growing depressed and distant, Hannah tells Grace that she knows Grace cannot read shorthand, the reason for which Grace does not know at the time. Hannah becomes pregnant, despite previous failures to conceive with her husband, and dies from complications during the birth. The baby, Florence, has Robbie's eyes, confirming her parentage, and is sent to live with Hannah's aunt in America. Some years later, Grace learns the shorthand letter explained that Hannah and Robbie were planning to run away together, requiring Hannah to fake her death, hence the suicide note which Grace was to give to Emmeline after the party. Hannah planned to write Emmeline once settled somewhere. Having carried this guilt her entire life, and finally telling the truth via the tapes to her grandson, Grace is able to die in peace.

The development of the H-1 Freeway took away commercial traffic that previously patronized Moiliili's businesses.Yuen, Mike. \\"Using past to buoy future\\" (Archive). Honolulu Star Advertiser. July 31, 2011. Retrieved on April 16, 2015. For a 40-year period before 2007, various members of the area community considered developing Moiliili into a college town environment. Around 2002 Evan Dobelle, the president of the University of Hawaii system, said that he would prioritize developing a college town. He also discussed the idea of moving the UH system offices from UH Manoa to Moiliili. In 2007 Kamehameha Schools bought of land from Pacific Theatres, including the Varsity Theatre and the Varsity Office Building, increasing its landholdings in Moiliili to 11.4 acres (4.6 ha), mostly along South King Street and University Avenue. Description A small and local community, composed of numerous small businesses such as florists, imported goods, ethnic foods and surf gear and apparel, the major focus of the small community is centered on the area of University Avenue and King Street, . Located beneath the busy intersection of South King Street and University Avenue lies a complex system of caves known as the Moiliili Karst. Originally the underwater stream was fed by the Manoa stream, but it has since been rerouted. A natural pond was formed and the popular Willows restaurant centered on this natural phenomenon. However, construction to the UH athletic fields and surrounding businesses caused collapses and rerouting of the underground waterway, and forced the owners to cement in the pond, making it now an artificial pond. Several species of fish and plant life live in this system of caves. This cave system is not open to spelunkers and is accessible only by a city sewer grate.

Quasi-experimental research shares similarities with the traditional experimental design or randomized controlled trial, but it specifically lacks the element of random assignment to treatment or control. Instead, quasi-experimental designs typically allow the researcher to control the assignment to the treatment condition, but using some criterion other than random assignment (e.g., an eligibility cutoff mark). In some cases, the researcher may have control over assignment to treatment. Quasi-experiments are subject to concerns regarding internal validity, because the treatment and control groups may not be comparable at baseline. With random assignment, study participants have the same chance of being assigned to the intervention group or the comparison group. As a result, differences between groups on both observed and unobserved characteristics would be due to chance, rather than to a systematic factor related to treatment (e.g., illness severity). Randomization itself does not guarantee that groups will be equivalent at baseline. Any change in characteristics post-intervention is likely attributable to the intervention. With quasi-experimental studies, it may not be possible to convincingly demonstrate a causal link between the treatment condition and observed outcomes. This is particularly true if there are confounding variables that cannot be controlled or accounted for. Design The first part of creating a quasi-experimental design is to identify the variables. The quasi-independent variable will be the x-variable, the variable that is manipulated in order to affect a dependent variable. \\"X\\" is generally a grouping variable with different levels. Grouping means two or more groups, such as two groups receiving alternative treatments, or a treatment group and a no-treatment group (which may be given a placebo ‚Äì placebos are more frequently used in medical or physiological experiments). The predicted outcome is the dependent variable, which is the y-variable. In a time series analysis, the dependent variable is observed over time for any changes that may take place. Once the variables have been identified and defined, a procedure should then be implemented and group differences should be examined. In an experiment with random assignment, study units have the same chance of being assigned to a given treatment condition. As such, random assignment ensures that both the experimental and control groups are equivalent. In a quasi-experimental design, assignment to a given treatment condition is based on something other than random assignment. Depending on the type of quasi- experimental design, the researcher might have control over assignment to the treatment condition but use some criteria other than random assignment (e.g., a cutoff score) to determine which participants receive the treatment, or the researcher may have no control over the treatment condition assignment and the criteria used for assignment may be unknown. Factors such as cost, feasibility, political concerns, or convenience may influence how or if participants are assigned to a given treatment conditions, and as such, quasi- experiments are subject to concerns regarding internal validity (i.e., can the results of the experiment be used to make a causal inference?). Quasi- experiments are also effective because they use the \\"pre-post testing\\". This means that there are tests done before any data are collected to see if there are any person confounds or if any participants have certain tendencies. Then the actual experiment is done with post test results recorded. This data can be compared as part of the study or the pre-test data can be included in an explanation for the actual experimental data. Quasi experiments have independent variables that already exist such as age, gender, eye color. These variables can either be continuous (age) or they can be categorical (gender). In short, naturally occurring variables are measured within quasi experiments. There are several types of quasi-experimental designs, each with different strengths, weaknesses and applications. These designs include (but are not limited to): *Difference in differences (pre-post with-without comparison) *Nonequivalent control groups design **no-treatment control group designs **nonequivalent dependent variables designs **removed treatment group designs **repeated treatment designs **reversed treatment nonequivalent control groups designs **cohort designs **post-test only designs **regression continuity designs *Regression discontinuity design *Case-control design **time-series designs **multiple time series design **interrupted time series design **propensity score matching **instrumental variables *Panel analysis Of all of these designs, the regression discontinuity design comes the closest to the experimental design, as the experimenter maintains control of the treatment assignment and it is known to \\"yield an unbiased estimate of the treatment effects\\". It does, however, require large numbers of study participants and precise modeling of the functional form between the assignment and the outcome variable, in order to yield the same power as a traditional experimental design. Though quasi-experiments are sometimes shunned by those who consider themselves to be experimental purists (leading Donald T. Campbell to coin the term ‚Äúqueasy experiments‚Äù for them), they are exceptionally useful in areas where it is not feasible or desirable to conduct an experiment or randomized control trial. Such instances include evaluating the impact of public policy changes, educational interventions or large scale health interventions. The primary drawback of quasi-experimental designs is that they cannot eliminate the possibility of confounding bias, which can hinder one's ability to draw causal inferences. This drawback is often used to discount quasi-experimental results. However, such bias can be controlled for using various statistical techniques such as multiple regression, if one can identify and measure the confounding variable(s). Such techniques can be used to model and partial out the effects of confounding variables techniques, thereby improving the accuracy of the results obtained from quasi-experiments. Moreover, the developing use of propensity score matching to match participants on variables important to the treatment selection process can also improve the accuracy of quasi-experimental results. In fact, data derived from quasi-experimental analyses has been shown to closely match experimental data in certain cases, even when different criteria were used. In sum, quasi-experiments are a valuable tool, especially for the applied researcher. On their own, quasi- experimental designs do not allow one to make definitive causal inferences; however, they provide necessary and valuable information that cannot be obtained by experimental methods alone. Researchers, especially those interested in investigating applied research questions, should move beyond the traditional experimental design and avail themselves of the possibilities inherent in quasi-experimental designs.  Ethics  A true experiment would, for example, randomly assign children to a scholarship, in order to control for all other variables. Quasi-experiments are commonly used in social sciences, public health, education, and policy analysis, especially when it is not practical or reasonable to randomize study participants to the treatment condition. As an example, suppose we divide households into two categories: Households in which the parents spank their children, and households in which the parents do not spank their children. We can run a linear regression to determine if there is a positive correlation between parents' spanking and their children's aggressive behavior. However, to simply randomize parents to spank or to not spank their children may not be practical or ethical, because some parents may believe it is morally wrong to spank their children and refuse to participate. Some authors distinguish between a natural experiment and a \\"quasi-experiment\\". The difference is that in a quasi-experiment the criterion for assignment is selected by the researcher, while in a natural experiment the assignment occurs 'naturally,' without the researcher's intervention. Quasi-experiments have outcome measures, treatments, and experimental units, but do not use random assignment. Quasi-experiments are often the design that most people choose over true experiments. The main reason is that they can usually be conducted while true experiments can not always be. Quasi-experiments are interesting because they bring in features from both experimental and non experimental designs. Measured variables can be brought in, as well as manipulated variables. Usually Quasi-experiments are chosen by experimenters because they maximize internal and external validity.  Advantages  Since quasi-experimental designs are used when randomization is impractical and/or unethical, they are typically easier to set up than true experimental designs, which requireCHARM-Controlled Experiments random assignment of subjects. Additionally, utilizing quasi-experimental designs minimizes threats to ecological validity as natural environments do not suffer the same problems of artificiality as compared to a well-controlled laboratory setting.http://www.osulb.edu/~msaintg/ppa696/696quasi.htm Since quasi- experiments are natural experiments, findings in one may be applied to other subjects and settings, allowing for some generalizations to be made about population. Also, this experimentation method is efficient in longitudinal research that involves longer time periods which can be followed up in different environments. Other advantages of quasi experiments include the idea of having any manipulations the experimenter so chooses. In natural experiments, the researchers have to let manipulations occur on their own and have no control over them whatsoever. Also, using self selected groups in quasi experiments also takes away to chance of ethical, conditional, etc. concerns while conducting the study.  Disadvantages  Quasi-experimental estimates of impact are subject to contamination by confounding variables. In the example above, a variation in the children's response to spanking is plausibly influenced by factors that cannot be easily measured and controlled, for example the child's intrinsic wildness or the parent's irritability. The lack of random assignment in the quasi-experimental design method may allow studies to be more feasible, but this also poses many challenges for the investigator in terms of internal validity. This deficiency in randomization makes it harder to rule out confounding variables and introduces new threats to internal validity.Lynda S. Robson, Harry S. Shannon, Linda M. Goldenhar, Andrew R. Hale (2001)Quasi-experimental and experimental designs: more powerful evaluation designs , Chapter 4 of Guide to Evaluating the Effectiveness of Strategies for Preventing Work Injuries: How to show whether a safety intervention really works , Institute for Work & Health, Canada Because randomization is absent, some knowledge about the data can be approximated, but conclusions of causal relationships are difficult to determine due to a variety of extraneous and confounding variables that exist in a social environment. Moreover, even if these threats to internal validity are assessed, causation still cannot be fully established because the experimenter does not have total control over extraneous variables.Research Methods: Planning: Quasi-Exper. Designs Disadvantages also include the study groups may provide weaker evidence because of the lack of randomness. Randomness brings a lot of useful information to a study because it broadens results and therefore gives a better representation of the population as a whole. Using unequal groups can also be a threat to internal validity. If groups are not equal, which is sometimes the case in quasi experiments, then the experimenter might not be positive what the causes are for the results.  Internal validity  Internal validity is the approximate truth about inferences regarding cause-effect or causal relationships. This is why validity is important for quasi experiments because they are all about causal relationships. It occurs when the experimenter tries to control all variables that could affect the results of the experiment. Statistical regression, history and the participants are all possible threats to internal validity. The question you would want to ask while trying to keep internal validity high is \\"Are there any other possible reasons for the outcome besides the reason I want it to be?\\" If so, then internal validity might not be as strong.  External validity  External validity is the extent to which results obtained from a study sample can be generalized \\"to\\" some well-specified population of interest, and \\"across\\" subpopulations of people, times, contexts, and methods of study.Cook, Thomas D. and Donald T. Campbell (1979), Quasi-experimentation: Design & Analysis Issues for Field Settings. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Lynch has argued that generalizing \\"to\\" a population is almost never possible because the populations to which we would like to project are measures of future behavior, which by definition cannot be sampled.Lynch, John G., Jr. (1982), \\"On the External Validity of Experiments in Consumer Research,\\" Journal of Consumer Research, 9 (December), 225‚Äì239. Therefore, the more relevant question is whether treatment effects generalize \\"across\\" subpopulations that vary on background factors that might not be salient to the researcher. External validity depends on whether the treatments studies have homogeneous effects across different subsets of people, times, contexts, and methods of study or whether the sign and magnitude of any treatment effects changes across subsets in ways that may not be acknowledged or understood by the researchers.Cronbach, Lee J. (1975),\\"Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology\\" American Psychologist 30 (2), 116. Athey and Imbens and Athey and Wager have pioneered machine learning techniques for inductive understanding of heterogeneous treatment effects.Athey, Susan, and Guido Imbens (2016), \\"Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 113, (27), 7353‚Äì7360.Wager, Stefan, and Susan Athey (2018), \\"Estimation and inference of heterogeneous treatment effects using random forests.\\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 113 (523), 1228‚Äì1242.  Design types  \\"Person-by- treatment\\" designs are the most common type of quasi experiment design. In this design, the experimenter measures at least one independent variable. Along with measuring one variable, the experimenter will also manipulate a different independent variable. Because there is manipulating and measuring of different independent variables, the research is mostly done in laboratories. An important factor in dealing with person-by-treatment designs are that random assignment will need to be used in order to make sure that the experimenter has complete control over the manipulations that are being done to the study. An example of this type of design was performed at the University of Notre Dame. The study was conducted to see if being mentored for your job led to increased job satisfaction. The results showed that many people who did have a mentor showed very high job satisfaction. However, the study also showed that those who did not receive the mentor also had a high number of satisfied employees. Seibert concluded that although the workers who had mentors were happy, he could not assume that the reason for it was the mentors themselves because of the numbers of the high number of non-mentored employees that said they were satisfied. This is why prescreening is very important so that you can minimize any flaws in the study before they are seen. \\"Natural experiments\\" are a different type of quasi-experiment design used by researchers. It differs from person-by-treatment in a way that there is not a variable that is being manipulated by the experimenter. Instead of controlling at least one variable like the person-by-treatment design, experimenters do not use random assignment and leave the experimental control up to chance. This is where the name \\"natural\\" experiment comes from. The manipulations occur naturally, and although this may seem like an inaccurate technique, it has actually proven to be useful in many cases. These are the studies done to people who had something sudden happen to them. This could mean good or bad, traumatic or euphoric. An example of this could be studies done on those who have been in a car accident and those who have not. Car accidents occur naturally, so it would not be ethical to stage experiments to traumatize subjects in the study. These naturally occurring events have proven to be useful for studying posttraumatic stress disorder cases.

It has a population of 1,217 (2005).2005 Statistics of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n  History  The village was first mentioned in 1495 as Mosty. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. During the Thirty Years' War on 21 April 1647, a battle between Swedish (led by Arvid Wittenberg) and Habsburg armies took place here. Swedish army was defeated and retreated from the region afterwards. On the spot of Swedish mass grave a chapel was erected. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 811 in 1880 to 1,209 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (between 91.9% and 98%) accompanied by a German-speaking minority (at most 64 or 8% in 1880) and Czech-speaking people (at most 14 or 1.2% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (53.4%), followed by Protestants (46.1%) and Jews (5 people). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

Despite initially being released as a B-side, the song managed to chart in its own right in the U.S., just outside the Billboard Hot 100. It was also included on the Byrds' debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. The song was written by band member Gene Clark, who also sings the lead vocal. \\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\" has been covered by a number of different artists over the years, and is regarded by fans and critics as one of the Byrds' best known songs. Composition and content The song dates from the Byrds' pre-fame residency at Ciro's nightclub in Los Angeles, as Clark explained during an interview: \\"There was a girlfriend I had known at the time, when we were playing at Ciro's. It was a weird time in my life because everything was changing so fast and I knew we were becoming popular. This girl was a funny girl, she was kind of a strange little girl and she started bothering me a lot. And I just wrote the song, 'I'm gonna feel a whole lot better when you're gone,' and that's all it was, but I wrote the whole song within a few minutes.\\" Byrds expert Tim Conners has called the song \\"the Platonic ideal of a Byrds song\\", in reference to the presence of some of the band's early musical trademarks, including Jim McGuinn's jangling 12-string Rickenbacker guitar; Chris Hillman's complex bass work; David Crosby's propulsive rhythm guitar, and the band's complex harmony singing and use of wordless \\"aaahhhh\\"s. Band biographer Johnny Rogan has also commented on the song's country-influenced guitar solo. The song is built around a riff that Clark later admitted was based on the Searchers' cover of \\"Needles and Pins\\". Music critic Mark Deming has said that, lyrically, \\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\" takes a sardonic view of romance, with Clark undecided about whether to break off a relationship with a woman who hasn't been entirely honest with him. The song's refrain of \\"I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone\\" betrays Clark's uncertainty about ending the relationship and whether such an act would be the answer to his problems or not. Deming has also pointed out that the use of the word \\"probably\\" in this refrain is key and lends the track a depth of subtext that was unusual for a pop song in the mid-1960s. Jim Dickson, the Byrds' manager, has remarked that this level of subtext was not unusual in Clark's songs of the period. Said Dickson, \\"There was always something to unravel in those songs, the non-explanation of the complex feeling. For instance, if you remember I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better, it doesn't say: \\"I'll feel a whole lot better\\", but \\"I'll probably feel a whole lot better.\\" For me, that makes the song. There's a statement followed by a hesitation.\\" Dickson would later work as a producer on Clark's 1984 album Firebyrd, which featured a re-recorded version of \\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\". Reception Although it was initially released as the B-side of the \\"All I Really Want to Do\\" single, \\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\" was itself heavily promoted by Columbia Records during the time that \\"All I Really Want to Do\\" spent on the Billboard charts. As a result, the song managed to chart in its own right in the U.S., reaching number 103. Mark Deming has commented that \\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\" was the first song written by a member of the Byrds to be commercially successful. Since its release, the song has become a rock music standard, inspiring a number of cover versions over the years. It is also considered by many critics to be one of the band's, as well as Clark's, best and most popular songs, with Rolling Stone magazine ranking it at number 234 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Cover versions Tom Petty covered the song (as \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better\\") on his 1989 solo album, Full Moon Fever. Petty's version was released as the fourth single from the album and peaked at number 18 on the US Rock chart. Don Nix on his 1976 album Gone Too Long with George Harrison, retitled \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better\\". In 1978, country singer Bobby Bare covered the song on his album Sleeper Wherever I Fall. San Francisco band The Flamin' Groovies also released a cover of the song on their 1978 Sire Records release, Flamin' Groovies Now. Paisley Underground band The Three O'Clock covered the song on their Baroque Hoedown EP. Reportedly, Gene Clark sings backing vocal on this version of the song. Argentinian rock musician Charly Garc√≠a covered the song on his 1990 album, Filosof√≠a Barata y Zapatos de Goma. The track was named \\"Me Siento Mucho Mejor\\" and the lyrics were translated into Spanish. Country pop artist Juice Newton covered the song on her 1985 Old Flame album but the song is slightly retitled as \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better\\". Newton's version also alters some of the song's verse lyrics. Likewise, The Crust Brothers covered the song on their 1998 live album, Marquee Mark, under this slightly altered title. Johnny Rivers covered the song in 1973 on his Blue Suede Shoes album and the song was also included on his 2006 compilation album, Secret Agent Man: The Ultimate Johnny Rivers Anthology. Dinosaur Jr. did a grungy cover on the Byrds tribute album, Time Between ‚Äì A Tribute to The Byrds. Reportedly, this version was Gene Clark's favorite cover of the song because he felt that the band had captured the essence of the lyrics, but successfully made the music even more uptempo. Marty Stuart's 2017 album Way Out West features a mash-up of \\"I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better\\" and some original Stuart lyrics. Not only that but the album was produced by Mike Campbell of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, who also plays guitars on the track as he did on Petty's version from Full Moon Fever.

The cause of the disease are mutations in any of the 5 genes encoding subunits of the translation initiation factor eIF2B: EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, or EIF2B5. The disease belongs to a family of conditions called the Leukodystrophies.  Symptoms and signs  Onset usually occurs in childhood, however some adult cases have been found. Generally, physicians look for the symptoms in children. Symptoms include cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, optic atrophy, epilepsy, loss of motor functions, irritability, vomiting, coma, and even fever has been tied to VWM. The neurological disorders and symptoms which occur with VWM are not specific to countries; they are the same all over the world. Neurological abnormalities may not always be present in those who experience onset as adults. Symptoms generally appear in young children or infants who were previously developing fairly normally.  Causes  VWM is a leukodystrophy which has unique biochemical abnormalities. A unique characteristic of VWM is that only oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are negatively affected while other glial cells and neurons seem to be unaffected. This is the central question behind VWM. The real reasons behind this behavior are unknown since the cells are in the brain and have been rarely studied. However, there is a theory which is generally accepted by most experts in the field. The main characteristic of these cells is the fact that they synthesize a lot of proteins. These cells produce a large amount of proteins from a small amount of precursors and so are constantly working and under a reasonable amount of stress. So with a mutation in eIF2B, slight increases in the amount of stress these cells encounter occur, making them more susceptible to failure due to stress. The large amount of oligodendrocytes which display apoptotic characteristics and express apoptotic proteins suggests cell number reduction in the early stages of the disease. Premature ovarian failure has also been associated with diminishing white matter. However through an intensive survey, it was determined that even if an individual has premature ovarian failure, she does not necessarily have VWM. = eIF2B's role = Overview of eIF2 and eIF2B's purpose in cells eIF2B is the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for eIF2, and is composed of 5 subunits. The largest subunit, eIF2B5 contains the most mutations for VWM. eIF2B is a complex which is very involved with the regulation of in the translation of mRNA into proteins. eIF2B is essential for the exchange of guanosine diphosphate(GDP) for guanosine-5'-triphosphate(GTP) in the initiation of translation via eIF2, because eIF2 is regenerated through this exchange. A decrease in eIF2B activity has been correlated with the onset of VWM. A common factor among VWM patients is mutations in the five subunits of eIF2B (21 discovered thus far), expressed in over 60% of the patients. These mutations lead to the decreased activity of eIF2B. The most common mutation is R113H, which is the mutation of histidine to arginine. The homozygous form of the mutation is the least severe form. This mutation has also been documented in rodents, but they do not acquire VWM, while humans do. Another common mutation is G584A found in the eIF2B5 subunit. A correlation with stress has also been made, as eIF2B plays a central role in stress management ‚Äì it is essential in down regulation protein synthesis in different stress conditions ‚Äì and VWM patients are highly sensitive to stress. Protein eIF2B exists in all cells, and if this protein is reduced enough the cell will be negatively affected, and if it is reduced to zero, the cell will die. In affected cells, the protein is reduced to about 50%, which is acceptable for functionality in most cells, but not in glial cells since they synthesize a large amount of proteins constantly and need as many functioning proteins within them as possible. This would lower the baseline of the amount of stress a cell can handle, and thus in a stressed environment, it would have detrimental effects on these cells. Mutations in three of the subunits of eIF2B (2,4,&5) has been seen in both VWM and premature ovarian failure. The North American Cree population has also been found to have a distinctive mutation, R195H, which can lead to VWM. All patients who have been studied only have one mutation present in the gene, causing the eIF2B to still be active, which leads to VWM. If two mutations occurred, then eIF2B activity would be stopped by the body.  Neuropathology  Upon autopsy, the full effect of VWM has been documented. The gray matter remains normal in all characteristics while the white matter changes texture, becoming soft and gelatinous. Rarefaction of the white matter is seen through light microscopy and the small number of axons and U-fibers that were affected can also be seen. Numerous small cavities in the white matter are also apparent. The key characteristic that sets VWM apart from the other leukodystrophies is the presence of foamy oligodendrocytes. These foamy oligodendrocytes tend to have increased cytoplasmic structures, a greater number of irregular mitochondria and a higher rate of apoptosis. Abnormally shaped astrocytes with fibrile infections are very prevalent throughout the capillaries in the brain. Strangely, astrocytes are affected more than oligodendrocytes; there is even a reduction in the astrocyte progenitors, yet axons remain relatively unharmed.  Diagnosis  Most diagnosis occurs in the early years of life around 2 to 6 years old. There have been cases in which onset and diagnosis have occurred late into adulthood. Those with onset at this time have different signs, particularly the lack of cognitive deterioration. Overall, detection of adult forms of VWM is difficult as MRI was not a common tool when they were diagnosed. Common signs to look for include chronic progressive neurological deterioration with cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, mental decline, decline of vision, mild epilepsy, hand tremor, the ability to chew and swallow food becomes difficult, rapid deterioration and fibrile infections following head trauma or fright, loss of motor functions, irritability, behavioural changes, vomiting, and even coma. Those who go into coma, if they do come out usually die within a few years. The diagnosis can be difficult if the physician does not take an MRI. = Case report on diagnosis of adult-onset VWM = The individual was examined at age 32, but he stated that he started noting differences 5 years before. He noticed sexual impotency, social isolation, unexplained aggression and sadness, loss of motivation, inert laughs, auditory hallucinations, thought insertion, delusions, and imperative commenting. He showed very minimal physical impairments, commonly seen in child-onsets. However, his MRI showed characteristic signs of VWM disease. = MRI = The MRI of patients with VWM shows a well defined leukodystrophy. These MRIs display reversal of signal intensity of the white matter in the brain. Recovery sequences and holes in the white matter are also visible. Over time, the MRI is excellent at showing rarefaction and cystic degeneration of the white matter as it is replaced by fluid. To show this change, displaying white matter as a high signal (T2-weighted), proton density, and Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images are the best approach. T2-weighted images also displaying cerebrospinal fluid and rarefied/cystic white matter. To view the remaining tissue, and get perspective on the damage done (also helpful in determining the rate of deterioration) (T1-weighted), proton density, and FLAIR images are ideal as they show radiating stripe patterns in the degenerating white matter. A failure of MRI images is their ineffectiveness and difficulty in interpretation in infants since the brain has not fully developed yet. Though some patterns and signs may be visible, it is still difficult to conclusively diagnose. This often leads to misdiagnosis in infants particularly if the MRI results in equivocal patterns or because of the high water content in infants' brains. The easiest way to fix this problem is a follow-up MRI in the following weeks. A potentially similar appearance of MRI with white matter abnormalities and cystic changes may be seen in some patients with hypomelanosis of Ito, some forms of Lowe's (oculocerebrorenal) disease, or some of the mucopolysaccharidoses. = Common misdiagnosis = Often with VWM, the lack of knowledge of the disease causes a misdiagnosis among physicians. As VWM is a member of the large group of leukodystrophy syndromes, it is often misdiagnosed as another type such as metachromatic leukodystrophy. More often than not, it is simply classified as a non-specific leukodystrophy. The characteristics of the brain upon autopsy are often very similar to atypical diffuse sclerosis, such as the presence of fibrillary astrocytes and scant sudanophilic lipids. Adult-onset VWM disease can present with psychosis and may be hard to differentiate from schizophrenia. Common misdiagnosis from misinterpreting the MRI include asphyxia, congential infections, metabolic diseases. Multiple sclerosis is often a misdiagnosis, but only in children due to its neurological characteristics, onset in early years, and MRI abnormalities. However, there are many differences between the two diseases. The glial cells express a loss of myelin. This loss of myelin is different from that seen in other diseases where hypomyelination occurs. In VWM, the cells never produce the normal amounts, whereas with diseases like MS, the cells' normal amounts are deteriorated. Also, with MS, the demyelination occurs due to inflammation, which is not the case in VWM. Cell differences include a lower penetration of the macrophages and microglia, as well as the lack of T cells and B cells in VWM. Finally, patients with MS have widespread demyelination, but those with VWM only express demyelination in a localized area. Some atypical forms of multiple sclerosis (multiple sclerosis with cavitary lesions) can be specially difficult to differentiate but there are some clues in MRI imaging that can help.Ayrignac et al. Brain magnetic resonance imaging helps to differentiate atypical multiple sclerosis with cavitary lesions and vanishing white matter disease, European Journal of Neurology Volume 23, Issue 6, 04 January 2016, doi=https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.12931  Treatment  There are no treatments, only precautions which can be taken, mainly to reduce trauma to the head and avoiding physiological stress. Melatonin has been shown to provide cytoprotective traits to glial cells exposed to stressors such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. These stressors would be detrimental to cells with a genetically reduced activity of protein eIF2B. However, research connecting these ideas have not been conducted yet.  Epidemiology  Extensive pathological and biochemical tests were performed, however the cause was found by studying a small population in which mutations in the eIF2B gene were found. No effective systemic studies have been conducted to determine the incidence around the world, but through the studies conducted thus far, it appears to be more prevalent in the white populations. VWM appears to have a lower number of cases in the Middle East, and Turkey has not yet had a reported case. Its prevalence is limited by the physician‚Äôs ability to identify the disease.Dr. Raphael Schiffmann (Director of Baylor Research Institute at Dallas, Texas). Telephone Interview 2008-11-08. As of 2006, more than 200 people have been identified with VWM, many of whom were originally diagnosed with an unclassified leukodystrophy.  History  The first time this disease was documented was in 1962 when Eickle studied a 36-year-old woman. Her first symptoms, gait difficulties and secondary amenorrhoea, occurred when she was 31 years old. Throughout the duration of her life, she experienced chronic episodes with extensive deterioration of her brain following minor physical trauma. Upon death, autopsy was performed in which the cerebral white matter displayed dispersed cystic areas. These areas were surrounded by a dense net of oligodendrocytes in which only mild fibrillary astrocytes and scant sudanophilic lipids were found. As the years progressed, more accounts of similar patients with similar symptoms were documented; however no one classified all the accounts as the same disease. It was not until 1993-94 when Dr. Hanefeld and Dr. Schiffmann and their colleagues identified the disease as childhood-onset progressive leukoencephalopathy. They determined it was autosomal recessive. They too saw that head trauma was a trigger for the onset of VWM. The key factor which allowed them to connect these patients together was the results of the magnetic-resonance spectroscopy in which the normal white matter signals were gone and often replaced with resonances indicative of lactate and glucose. They determined the cause was hypomyelination. in 1997-98, Dr. Marjo S. van der Knaap and colleagues saw the same characteristics in another set of patients, but these patients also expressed febrile infections. Dr. van der Knaap used MRI as well as magnetic- resonance spectroscopy and determined that ongoing cystic degeneration of the cerebral white matter and matter rarefaction was more descriptive of the disease rather than hypomyelination and proposed the name vanishing white matter. The name proposed by Dr. Schiffmann in 1994, childhood ataxia with central hypomyelination (CACH) is another commonly accepted name.

He was considered America's foremost expert on this group and was widely sought out for identification of species in this order. Biography Uhler was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of George Washington Uhler and Anna Reese Uhler. His father was a prosperous merchant and his great-grandfather, Erasmus Uhler, emigrated to America and served in the Revolutionary War.Mallis (1971) Uhler's private schooling provided a strong background in Latin and German. He attended Latin School in Baltimore and then Baltimore College. Uhler's youthful interest in entomology started when he began collecting insects at the family farm near Reisterstown. His pursuit was encouraged by a family friend, John Gottlieb Morris, an amateur naturalist and the first librarian for the Peabody Institute. Although his father set him up in business, Uhler preferred to spend his time studying geology, botany, and entomology. One of his earliest papers was the Descriptions of a Few Species of Coleoptera Supposed to be New, published in 1856. In 1861 he published his first paper on the insect order, Hemiptera (true bugs), and most of his subsequent entomological papers focused almost entirely on this group. In 1861 he translated from Latin Hermann A. Hagen's Synopsis of Neuroptera of North America, issued by the Smithsonian Institution.Schwarz (1914)Sterling (1997) In 1862 Uhler was appointed assistant librarian at the Peabody, working under Morris. A short time later he began his studies at Harvard University as a student of Louis Agassiz. In 1864 Agassiz appointed Uhler to serve as both librarian at the Museum of Comparative Zoology and curator of the museum's substantial insect collections. At the same time Uhler taught entomology to Harvard undergraduates and gave a series of lectures at the museum. He also attended the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard and studied with some of the university's most notable scientists and naturalists including Asa Gray, Jeffries Wyman, Agassiz and Nathaniel Shaler.Dictionary of American Biography (1936) Uhler returned to Baltimore in 1867, resuming his position as assistant librarian at the Peabody Institute and in 1870 he was appointed librarian, a position he held for the rest of his life. He was also actively involved in the formation of Johns Hopkins University and in 1876 became one of the first associate professors at the new research university. In addition to his work at the Peabody and Johns Hopkins, Uhler found time to continue his studies of the Hemiptera. He was the foremost American expert on this insect order and corresponded extensively with other entomologists. He described many of the Hemiptera that were gathered by exploring expeditions in the American West and in 1877 the US Geological Survey published his List of Hemiptera of the Region West of the Mississippi River, Including Those Collected by the Hayden Explorations of 1877. Over the course of his career Uhler identified about 600 new species of insects. He also wrote a few notable papers on the geology of the Cretaceous and introduced improved methods of cataloging books at the Peabody. Working with Nathaniel H. Morison, Uhler published a comprehensive five-volume catalog of the Peabody library holdings (1883-1892). Uhler was involved in numerous scientific organizations. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, founder and president of the Maryland Academy of Science, and member of the American Entomological Society, Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Entomological Society of Washington, and the Royal Society of the Arts (London). Uhler published his last paper, Recognition of two North American species of Cicada, in 1905. By then his vision was severely impaired with glaucoma and he was forced to curtail his studies. He died on October 21, 1913. Works During his career, Uhler published about fifty papers and books on entomology, geology, and library science. Some of his writings include:Henshaw (1903) *(1856) Descriptions of a Few Species of Coleoptera Supposed to be New *(1861) Hemiptera of the North Pacific exploring expedition under Com‚Äôrs Rodgers and Ringgold *(1872) Notices of the Hemiptera of the western territories of the United States, chiefly from the surveys of Dr. F.

He played in five full international matches for Scotland between 1969 and 1971. Career Curran began his career at Home Farm when his family moved to Dublin in 1954. After 6 years playing at all grades he moved to Shamrock Rovers to gain experience. After a period as an apprentice at Manchester United he was released and returned to his native Scotland with Third Lanark as a semi-pro where he struggled to see much first team action, instead joining Corby Town. Spotted by Millwall, Curran signed professional forms at The Den in March 1964. Finishing his first full season with 19 goals, he was the club's leading scorer as they won promotion from the fourth tier in 1965. This proved to be his only full campaign for Millwall, as he moved to Norwich City in January 1966. Serving the Carrow Road club for three years in the second flight, Curran scored 53 goals in total and was voted their player of the year in 1968. In January 1969, Curran joined Wolverhampton Wanderers in a ¬£60,000 deal. He finished his first full season in the First Division as the leading goalscorer at Molineux with 23 goals, adding a further 20 in the following campaign.

He won five caps in total, over an 18-month period, his one-goal coming against England in a 3‚Äì1 defeat at Wembley in May 1971. The emergence of John Richards at Wolves saw Curran's appearances limited to just eight matches during the 1971/72 season. His final game for the club was in the second leg of the 1972 UEFA Cup Final where they lost out on the trophy to their countrymen Spurs. Out of contention, Curran departed Wolves with the impressive tally of 47 goals from his 98 appearances. Curran left Wolves in September 1972, joining second- flight Oxford United for ¬£50,000.

The island‚Äôs northern tip is southwest of the port city of Prince Rupert, and due south of the southernmost extension of the Alaska Panhandle. The island is located within the Range 5 Coast Land District and the Skeena- Queen Charlotte Regional District. Porcher Island is bounded on the north by Chatham Sound and the Skeena River estuary, by Hecate Strait to the west and by Ogden Channel to the east. Metlakata Inlet and Kitkatla Channel separate Porcher‚Äôs southern flank from the Goschen, Dolphin and Spicer Islands, near the entrance to Principe Channel. Porcher Island is nearly bisected from the south by Porcher Inlet, a long, narrow channel that intrudes into the island‚Äôs interior, before emptying into a salt lagoon at the foot of the Spiller Range. Oval Bay, on the island‚Äôs western edge, features a sandy beach, which is exposed to the ferocious southeast gales that regularly sweep through Hecate Strait. The interior of the island is hilly, Egeria Mountain, southeast of Porcher Inlet, is the tallest reaching to 2,915 feet, while the Bell Range dominates to the northwest .  History  Porcher Island, part of the territories of the Gitxaala Nation, is named after Edwin Augustus Porcher, RN (1821‚Äì1878), who served as Commander of HMS Sparrowhawk at Esquimalt Naval Base, Vancouver Island, from the spring of 1865 until he returned to England in the fall of 1868. While serving with the North Pacific Squadron, Commander Porcher made four summertime voyages to the North Coast of British Columbia; in 1866, 1867 and twice in 1868. The route of the Inside Passage that the Sparrowhawk took from Esquimalt to the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company trading post at Fort Simpson (the Tsimshian village of Lax Kw'alaams) would have passed close by the island in Chatham Sound that now bears the Commander‚Äôs name. With the exception of a brief influx of homesteaders in the wake of Prince Rupert being chosen as the terminus of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1906, Porcher Island has always been sparsely populated. The island‚Äôs relative isolation, combined with wet, cool summers and severe winters, has discouraged many of those who sought to make Porcher Island their permanent home. Nonetheless, three small settlements that were established during the 20th century still boast a few inhabitants today. These settlements are to be found at Hunts Inlet (formerly Jap Inlet) and at Humpback Bay, both on the island‚Äôs northernmost tip, and at Oona River, which flows into Ogden Channel at the island‚Äôs eastern edge. Hunts Inlet is a collection of older buildings grouped around a government dock, with the more recent addition of a number of vacation homes built by Prince Rupert residents. Gillnet Floats, Humpback Bay, Porcher Island, 1964Humpback Bay is the site of the former Porcher Island Cannery, now derelict. The salmon cannery was originally built by the Chatham Sound Fishing and Packing Company in 1928, but operated for only four years before closing at the end of the 1932 salmon season. The site was later purchased by the Canadian Fishing Company and used as a summer gillnet station until 1968, when gillnet operations were transferred to North Pacific Cannery. Humpback Bay continued to serve as a net storage facility until the 1980s, when the Crown lease was sold to private interests. With 30 or so permanent residents, Oona River currently has the largest population of the three surviving Porcher Island settlements. Situated at the northern end of Ogden Channel, Oona River was originally settled by Scandinavian immigrants in the years before and after the First World War. The village has long been a source of wooden boats for the B.C. salmon fishing industry. Scores of these sturdy, seaworthy vessels were hand-built from red and yellow cedar by early settlers and their descendants, and some can still be seen in use today. The Oona River Salmon Enhancement Project, first established some 25 years ago, continues to rebuild threatened coho salmon stocks in the Porcher Island area. The island, together with some of its surrounding area, (excluding Kitkatla (Laxklan), a Tsimshian village, is situated on Dolphin Island) had a population of 37 in the Canada 2006 Census, down 26% from the 2001 census.  Ecology  Porcher Island is part of the Hecate Lowland Ecosection, a once heavily glaciated band of narrow lowland rain forest and coastal archipelago that stretches from Portland Inlet in the north to Queen Charlotte Strait in the south. Hecate Lowland terrain is generally rough and rocky, with wide areas of muskeg wetland and bog forest. Tree species include western red cedar, yellow cedar, mountain hemlock and fir. Salal, ferns, and skunk cabbage are commonly found undergrowth. Lowland climate in the Porcher Island region is dominated by frontal flows from Dixon Entrance, resulting in frequent wind storms and heavy rainfall.

Before the arrival of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1914, the Prince George area was known as Fort George and was a Lheidli T'enneh village and Hudson's Bay Company store. In 1909, two rival townsites were built and promoted. One was on the Fraser River and was called South Fort George, while the other was on the Nechako River and was called Central Fort George. Both of these townsites believed that the railway would build a station in their community, but in May 1912, the railway chose to purchase the First Nation's village instead.City of Prince George - Street History History =Early pioneers= In 1909, Nick Clark of the Northern Development Company purchased the South Fort George property from Alexander Hamilton and Joseph Thapage. Then the company subdivided the land into town lots which would be put up for sale in 1910. Meanwhile, Nick Clark built a sawmill and, with Russell Peden and William Cooke, started the Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company and arranged for the building of a sternwheeler for the community, the Nechacco. The new steamer was intended to bring prospective property buyers to South Fort George and to furnish them with supplies. The Nechacco would be the first sternwheeler to reach South Fort George from Quesnel, arriving on May 30, 1909, barely nudging the Charlotte out of the honor. Once the community had sternwheeler service, other businesses began to arrive, such as the Bank of British North America, established in 1910, and three general stores. John Houston (on left) outside the Fort George Tribune Pioneer newspaperman John Houston arrived in South Fort George in the fall of 1909 and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was published on November 6, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. John's articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while he sat at his printing press and worked on the newspaper. =The Hotel Northern= Hotel Northern (1913) Hoteliers Al Johnson and Robert Burns arrived in 1910, but wisely waited until the BC Express Company chose South Fort George as the location for their office and steamer landing. Once Johnson and Burns learned that the newly built and luxurious BX would be landing at South Fort George, they built the Hotel Northern and applied for and received a liquor license by December 1910. Unfortunately the first Hotel Northern wouldn't operate for very long and would burn down on July 1, 1911. However, Al Johnson wasted no time in replacing it and built the second Hotel Northern on Hamilton Avenue, on the corner of 3rd Street. At the height of rail construction, particularly throughout 1913, the Northern was one of the busiest bars in British Columbia, employing 12 - 15 bartenders who worked along a bar. During this period, the Northern often sold $7,000 worth of 25 cent drinks in a single day. =The ladies of the evening= The Hotel Northern wasn't the only business making a fortune from railway construction. At least four brothels were built in South Fort George during this era and one Madam, Irene Jordan, did so well that she decided to expand her business into Central Fort George and built a large house there, the first two-piano brothel in Northern British Columbia. However, it turned out that Central Fort George did not want a brothel in their town and it was shut down by Police Chief Dunwoody. But the story would not end there. Undeterred, Miss Jordan had the new brothel skidded over to where the Prince George townsite was being built and the house was later rented by Prince George's first mayor, WG Gillette, to be the Prince George City Hall. Another public outcry erupted and the local newspaper editors had a grand time making jokes and drawing cartoons about this arrangement, until the mayor and the city council moved out into a new City Hall. =Theatres= Northern Interior Amusement Company opened the 500-seat-capacity Fort George Theatre in 1911 to operate every night except Sunday.

Part of the reason for its decline was the construction of Prince George. Several of the South Fort George business had moved to better locations along George Street in the new town. Nevertheless, the main reason was the onset of the Great War, which caused many local men to enlist and travel overseas. The war also caused John Stewart of Foley, Welch and Stewart to put a halt to the local construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, which devastated the local economy even further. As the war continued, so did the decline in the population and the economy. In 1915, Al Johnson sold the Hotel Northern and moved down to Vancouver where he leased and operated the Castle Hotel until 1930. The BX sternwheeler continued to work on the river, but finished the 1915 season with a $7000 loss. By 1916, all of the sternwheelers had been taken off the upper Fraser River until 1918 when the BX operated until she sank in the Fort George Canyon and had to be rescued by the BC Express. The Quesnel ran for a few short weeks in 1921, until she too was wrecked in the Fort George Canyon. With the loss of so much of its population, Central Fort George was eventually abandoned and wouldn't be developed until 1953, but South Fort George persevered and became a village in 1968, remaining independent until 1976 when it was incorporated into the City of Prince George. South Fort George today Today South Fort George is a residential area and home to many local businesses such as pub named \\"Steamers\\", as well as some larger franchises, like Shaw Cable and 7-11. The Fraser-Fort George Museum is also in South Fort George, where residents and visitors can learn more about the area's fascinating history. The sternwheeler landing on Hamilton Avenue is commemorated by Paddlewheel Park.

In this letter, written around 1350, Petrarch claimed to be the first person since antiquity to have climbed a mountain for the view. Although the historical accuracy of his account has been questioned by modern scholars, it is often cited in discussions of the new spirit of the Renaissance. Contents Petrarch's letter is addressed to his former confessor, Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro. It says he ascended the mountain with his brother Gherardo and two servants, exactly ten years after they had left Bologna. They began at the village of Malauc√®ne at the foot of the mountain. On the way up, they met an old shepherd, who said he had climbed the mountain some fifty years before, finding only rocks and brambles, and that no one else had done it before or since. The brothers continued, Gherardo continuing up the ridge they were following, Petrarch ever trying for an easier, if longer, path.Petrarch himself applies this to his spiritual failures; this passage is one of the reasons the whole letter is regarded as allegory. At the top, they found a peak called Filiolus, \\"Little Son\\"; Petrarch reflected on the past ten years, and the waste of his earthly love for Laura. They looked out from that spot, seeing the Rhone and the C√©vennes, but not the Pyrenees (which are 200 miles away). At this point, Petrarch sat down and opened his Augustine, and immediately came upon \\"People are moved to wonder by mountain peaks, by vast waves of the sea, by broad waterfalls on rivers, by the all-embracing extent of the ocean, by the revolutions of the stars. But in themselves they are uninterested.\\" Confessions X.8.15 Petrarch fell silent on the trip down, reflecting on the vanity of human wishes and the nobility of uncorrupted human thought. When they arrived back in the village in the middle of the night, Petrarch wrote this letter \\"hastily and extemporaneously\\" - or so he says.Bishop, pp.102-112; quotes and translation from Bishop, as are the choice of points to summarize and the comment on the Pyrenees. Historic doubts It is often claimed that Petrarch was the first to climb Mont Ventoux, although he did not suggest so himself. The mountain was likely already climbed in prehistoric times and there is even a slightly older written account of an ascent, by Jean Buridan, who on his way to the papal court in Avignon before the year 1334 climbed Mt. Ventoux \\"in order to make some meteorological observations\\".Ernest A. Moody Jean Buridan in the Dictionary of Scientific BiographyMichael Kimmelman, \\"NOT Because it's There\\", The New York Times, June 6, 1999. See also Lynn Thorndike, pp. 69-74. It further seems implausible that Petrarch sat down and wrote the six thousand words we have, in elegant Latin with correct quotations from the classical poets, before dinner after an eighteen-hour hike up and down a mountain.So Bishop, p. 112 In fact, whether Petrarch himself climbed the mountain has been doubted by modern scholars; according to Pierre Courcelle and Giuseppe Billanovich, the letter is essentially a fiction written almost fifteen years after its supposed date, and almost a decade after the death of its addressee, Francesco Dionigi da Borgo San Sepulcro.O'Connell, Michael, \\"Authority and the Truth of Experience in Petrarch's 'Ascent of Mount Ventoux,'\\" Philological Quarterly, 62 (1983), p.507, citing Billanovich, Giuseppe. \\"Petrarca e il Ventuso,\\" Italia medioevale e umanisrica 9 (1966), pp. 389-401, and Courcelle, Pierre, \\"Petrarque entre Saint Augustin et les Augustins du XIVe siecle,\\" Studipetrarcheschi 7 (1961), pp. 51-71. Lyell Asher argued, indeed, that the ascent of the mountain was a figurative account of writing the letter itself.Asher, Lyell, Petrarch at the Peak of Fame; PMLA, Vol. 108, No. 5. (Oct., 1993), pp. 1050-1063. Modern reception Jakob Burckhardt, in The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy declared Petrarch \\"a truly modern man\\", because of the significance of nature for his \\"receptive spirit\\"; even if he did not yet have the skill to describe nature.Burckhardt, Civilization, Part IV ¬ß3, beginning. convenience link . Petrarch's implication that he was the first to climb mountains for pleasure,E.g. Bishop, p.104:\\"the first recorded Alpinist, the first to climb a mountain because it is there.\\" and Burckhardt's insistence on Petrarch's sensitivity to nature have been often repeated since.E.g. Kimmelman, who sees Petrarch's letter as early environmental writing. There are also numerous references to Petrarch as an \\"alpinist\\",E.g. Ernst Cassirer: The Renaissance Philosophy of Man, tr. Hans Nachod, p.28:\\"The colorful description of this enterprise has startled many readers who have been amazed to see a man of his epoch venturing to climb a mountain for a view like a modern alpinist\\" although Mont Ventoux is not a hard climb, and is not usually considered part of the Alps.Bishop, p.102,104 This implicit claim of Petrarch and Burckhardt, that Petrarch was the first to climb a mountain for pleasure since antiquity, was disproven by Lynn Thorndike in 1943.Thorndike, pp. 69-74 The Legitimacy of the Modern Age by Hans Blumenberg describes Petrarch's ascent of Ventoux as \\"one of the great moments that oscillate indecisively between the epochs,\\" namely between the medieval period and modernity. He also uses it to illustrate his theory of intellectual history: \\"The description of the ascent of Mont Ventoux exemplifies graphically what is meant by the 'reality' of history as the reoccupation of formal systems of positions.\\"Blumenberg, pp. 341, 342 James Hillman, in Re- Visioning Psychology, uses the story of Petrarch's ascent to illustrate his argument that the outer world of nature is mirrored by an equally vast inner world of images. Both worlds exist apart from the human being. The outer world may have motivated Petrarch to climb Mont Ventoux, but the inner world is what he discovered when he reached the top and read the passage from Augustine's Confessions.

Muslim British rappers Sheikh Terra and the Soul Salah Crew, or, as the video says: featuring the Soul Salah Crew. The music video begins with a CNN video clip showing US troops shooting an Iraqi individual and then rejoicing, the clip is then followed by the logo, \\"Digihad\\", playing on the terms Digital and Jihad. The Beat of Dirty Kuffar is also the same of the popular Lumidee song \\"Never Leave You-Uh Oh.\\" The soldier being interviewed at the beginning of the video is allegedly called Riddle and was interviewed by CNN.

The single version of the song is only named \\"Angel\\". The song was written as a wedding present for Lauren, the wife of principal songwriter and guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy. It is customary at Norwegian weddings that the husband-to-be professes his love for the bride in a unique way, and \\"Angel in the Snow\\" was Paul's contribution. \\"Angel in the Snow\\" appears on Memorial Beach but was recorded during a dark time in A-ha's history. The band rarely plays any songs from this era in concert. The live version of the music video is not available but was performed at the Valhall concert which was released on DVD. It is unclear why it was the only song not included in the release. There were actually two versions of this video. The first version was very similar, but included a quick scene featuring two fans, one of whom won the MTV contest to be in the video. It was only shown a few times, and version two replaced it in rotation. The single only reached number 41 in the UK Singles Chart. It also was going to be released in Germany but this was canceled.

It was a separate municipality but became administratively a part of Czech Teschen in 1960. It has a population of 1,064 (2005).2005 Statistics of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n The name of the village is possessive in origin derived from personal name ≈ªuk (≈ºuk means also a beetle).  History  The village of ≈Ωukov was first mentioned in the document of Pope Gregory IX issued for Benedictine abbey in Tyniec in 1229 as Zukow. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz, and since 1290 to the Duchy of Teschen. It was also a property of Benedictine monastery in Orlov√° founded around 1268. Probably because of financial problems the Benedictines sold part of the village, which later became known as Horn√≠ ≈Ωukov. In 1526 the Duchy of Teschen became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 692 in 1880 to 1,165 in 1910 with the majority being native Polish- speakers (between 96.8% and 99.5%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 26 or 3.2% in 1890) and Czech-speaking (at most 9 or 0.8% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Protestants (70.7%), followed by Roman Catholics (28.9%) and Jews (5 people). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

It has a population of 719 (2005).2005 Statistics of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n The name of the village is possessive in origin derived from personal name ≈ªuk (≈ºuk means also a beetle).  History  Lutheran chapel in the village The village of ≈Ωukov was first mentioned in the document of Pope Gregory IX issued for Benedictine abbey in Tyniec in 1229 as Zukow. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz, and since 1290 to the Duchy of Teschen. It was also a property of Benedictine monastery in Orlov√° founded around 1268. Probably because of financial problems the Benedictines sold part of the village, which later became known as Horn√≠ ≈Ωukov. In 1526 the Duchy of Teschen became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality dropped from 886 in 1880 to 859 in 1910 with the majority being native Polish-speakers (between 95.8% and 98.8%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 26 or 3% in 1890) and Czech-speaking (at most 10 or 1.2% in 1890). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Protestants (62%), followed by Roman Catholics (37.5%) and Jews (3 people). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

It has an area of . The town of Okushiri and the Hiyama Prefectural Natural Park encompass the entire island. It has many pastures, beech tree forests, and a rocky coastline. There are two elementary schools, one junior high school, and one senior high school. Okushiri currently has no colleges or universities. Etymology The name Okushiri comes from the Ainu name I-kus-un-sir (). The phonetic word ikus(un) means other side and sir means island. However, the Japanese meaning of the two kanji used for the name mean \\"deep inside/innermost\\" and \\"buttocks/hips\\". Geography Okushiri Island is located roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of mainland Hokkaido. It is oval in shape with a coastline of 84 kilometers (52.2 miles). The island spans 27 kilometers (16.8 miles) from north to south, and 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) from east to west. Mount Kamui is the island's highest peak, and reaches 584 meters (1,916 feet). Communities Two main towns, Aonae at the southern tip and Okushiri in the central-eastern portion, contain the majority of the island's population and infrastructure. Additional small communities and individual households are found near the coast, and are connected by a road that circumnavigates the island. History Okushiri has been struck by several natural disasters, the 1983 Sea of Japan earthquake on 26 May 1983 which killed two, and the more deadly 1993 Hokkaid≈ç earthquake and tsunami on 12 July 1993. The 1993 earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a major tsunami that caused deaths on Hokkaid≈ç and in southeastern Russia, with a total of 230 fatalities recorded. Okushiri Island was the hardest hit, with 198 casualties from the earthquake, tsunami and a large landslide. The tsunami inundated large parts of Okushiri, despite its tsunami defenses. The island subsided by . After the tsunami, the number of residents slowly declined, and continues to do so. Transportation Okushiri Airport serves the island with daily flights to and from Hakodate Airport. Regular ferry services to and from Esashi (2 hours and 20 minutes) and Setana (1 hour and 40 minutes) are provided by Heartland Ferry, and time timetable changes seasonally.http://www.heartlandferry.jp/english/e-esashi-time/ A local bus service operates year-round. Tourist activities Okushiri Island is known for \\"Nabetsuru Rock\\" translated to \\"pot-handle rock,\\" a small rock arch sitting offshore of Okushiri Town. Okushiri Island has one operating hot spring, and opportunities for fishing and swimming. The Okushiri Moonlight Marathon was started in 2013. It is the largest attraction on Okushiri Island for visitors, and attracts runners from around Japan and some foreign countries. The race starts at 3 pm and often finishes as it is getting dark. Local villagers turn out in large numbers to cheer on the runners. At the finish line, the race concludes with a seafood banquet and awards ceremony.https://www.fitjapan.com/events/2587/okushiri-moonlight-marathon/ References Category:Islands of the Sea of Japan Category:Islands of Hokkaido ","title":"Okushiri Island"},{"id":"11864898","title":"Alex Cabagnot"},{"id":"11864900","text":"Meloidogyne arenaria is a species of plant pathogenic nematodes.

Host range of Meloidogyne arenaria (Neal, 1889) Chitwood, 1949 (Nematoda: Meloidogynidae) in Spain.  History  M. arenaria has the same history as the other root knot nematodes. Meloidogyne spp were originally grouped together with the cyst nematodes (Heterodera spp) but they were later separated after they were confirmed to be significantly different from each other. The changes that were made when discovering Meloidogyne spp of nematodes are described below; *1855 ‚Äì Reverend Miles Joseph Berkeley (clergyman) noted galls on cucumbers in greenhouse in England. This was the first official report of nematodes that caused galls on plant roots. *1871 ‚Äì Schmidt described Heterodera schactii the sugarbeet cyst nematode. *1872 ‚Äì Greeff described Anguillula radicicola ‚Äì a nematode that caused galls on cereals and grasses but this was actually Ditylenchus and not a root knot nematode. *1879 ‚Äì Cornu ‚Äì described a root-knot nematode as Anguillula marioni . *1884 ‚Äì Muller decided root-knot nematode was the same as Greeff's root- galling nematode and that both should be Heterodera- Heterodera radicicola. *1887 ‚Äì Goeldi ‚Äì Brazil ‚Äì described a root knot on coffee ‚Äì Meloidogyne exigua. *1932 ‚Äì Goodey ‚Äì decided that use of Heterodera radicicola was incorrect according to International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature as original H. radicicola was not a root-knot nematode. He renamed it Heterodera marioni. *1949 ‚Äì Chitwood removed them from Heterodera because they differed from cyst nematodes. Since the oldest name for the genus was Goeldi's Meloidogyne exigua, that name had precedence. Chitwood described five species based on perineal patterns, M. arenaria being one of the five.Howard Ferris, 1999 to 2012 http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/taxadata/G076.HTM#Feeding  Distribution  Crop damage by this nematode is mostly faced in warmer regions and it is rarely found in areas where the average monthly temperatures approach freezing. The peanut root knot nematode, race 1 is found in all areas where peanuts are grown.K. Evans, D.L. Trudgill, J. M. Webster, 1993. Plant parasitic Nematodes in Temperate Agriculture pp 228‚Äì231.  Economic importance  The peanut root-knot nematode is the most serious nematode pest of the crop and questionably the most serious soil-borne disease problem. For example, the nematode is present in almost all fields where the crop is grown in Florida and economic damage is estimated to occur in greater than 50% of these fields. Individual peanut fields heavily infested with the root-knot nematode have sustained yield losses greater than 75%. In addition to causing considerable damage alone, it also increases the severity and incidence of other soil-borne diseases such as southern stem rot and Cylindrocladium blackrot.Jim Rich and Barry Tillman, 2009. Root-Knot Nematode Resistance in Peanut. M. arenaria is C-rated pest in California.  Morphology and anatomy  Different development stages of this nematode have unique features that are used to describe them. Among the characters commonly used to define nematode species and populations, morphometric characters have a marked significance. Females are swollen, pear-shaped pearly white and sedentary. They deposit their eggs in a gelatinous mass, which usually protrudes from galled root tissue. Females of this nematode are completely endoparasitic.Eisenback, J. D 1998. Plant and nematode interactions 1998 pp. 37‚Äì63. Morphology and systematics. Department of Plant Pathology, Physiology and Weed Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA Edited by Barker, K. R.; Pederson, G.A.; and Windham, G. L. Agronomy series No. 36. . Record Number 20013030208. Mature females of M. arenaria are identified by the cuticular markings in the perineal area, stylet length, punctations on the cuticle. When describing the morphology of M. arenaria race1, Eisenback et al., (1981) reported that in females, the dorsal arch is flattened and rounded. The striae in the arch are slightly indented at the lateral lines and generally form a shoulder on the arch. The stylet is very robust and the cone and shaft are broad. The labial disc and lips are dumb bell shaped and it has large lateral lips that are separated from the medial lips and the head region.Eisenback, J.D., Hirschmann, H., Sasser, J.N., and A.C.Triantaphyllou. 1981. A Guide to the Four Most Common Species of Root-Knot Nematodes, (Meloidogyne species) with a pictorial key. A Coop. Publ. Depts. Plant Pathol. and Genetics and U.S. Agency for International Development, Raleigh, NC. http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAQ221.pdf In a study in Argentina, perineal patterns of 100 females from a population of M. arenaria, race 2 growing on tomato plants were analyzed and moderate morphological variations observed. The overall shape was rounded in most cases, but it was oval-shaped in a small proportion (4%). Forty-six percent of females showed low dorsal arch while 38% depicted a high dorsal arc, while the rest were intermediate. Lines in the post-anal region were smooth or wavy, continuous or broken, occasionally forming shoulders (18% of females). Wings were generally not observed. Phasmids were visible in 25% of the patterns and the mean distance between them was 24.33 ¬± 1.61 mm. Only seven out of one hundred females presented perineal patterns with lateral lines weakly demarcated by forked striae. Adult females were pyriform and lacking a terminal protuberance in the posterior area of the body. The female body lengths ranged between 465 mm and 1,129 mm. The excretory pore of the females was located closer to the base of the stylet than to the median bulb, at approximately 2-stylet lengths, in agreement with a typical M. arenaria specimen. The stylet was dorsally curved. Second stage juveniles of this nematode are short (400‚Äì600 micrometers) with very short stylets (10-15micrometers). The stylet is lightly sclerotized with indistinct Knobs. The cephalic framework is also weakly sclerotized. The esophageal gland overlaps the intestine ventrally and the tail tapers to a pointed tip with a clear terminus In a study, second stage juveniles (J2s) averaged 458.51 ¬± 20.48 mm in length and 15.35 ¬± 0.76 mm in width. The rectum was undilated. Tail length (from anus to posterior end) was 56.21 ¬± 2.78 mm and the tail tip was rounded. Males of M. arenaria are long (1.0 to 2.0 mm). The stylet is short and has distinct knobs. The esophageal gland overlaps the intestine ventrally. The tail is short and rounded and has no bursa. Spicules open a short distance from the tail tip. The males also have a head cap that is low and slopes posteriorly with 2 or 3 incomplete annulations around the head region. The stylet is pointed and the lumen opening has a small protuberance on the ventral side. From their study, Garcƒ±¬¥a and Sa¬¥nchez-Puerta, (2012) also reported that the mean length of the male body was 1.6 ¬± 0.31 mm. The head of the males was flat to concave and showed a moderately elevated labial disc. The males also had four lateral lines, which were easily observed.  Symptoms of root knot disease of peanut  These nematodes cause symptoms both on leaves and roots. Foliar symptoms of root-knot disease may be expressed at any time during the growing season. These symptoms of nematode damage on peanut plants range from stunting, yellowing, wilting and even plant death. Ferris (1999‚Äì2012), also reported that nematodes cause yellowing; mid-day wilting; symptoms of water and nutrient stress; and sometimes death, especially if the nematode is interacting with other organisms. They can appear in a peanut crop beginning about 100 days after planting or after periods of dry hot weather. Areas of root-knot nematode damaged peanut are usually round to oblong in shape, and rows of infected plants may never overlap as those of healthy plants. It is common for plants to wilt and eventually die in areas where nematode populations are high. Root symptoms are similar to those caused by all nematodes including a reduction in number of feeder roots and root stunting, but root knot nematodes cause unique symptoms on roots and pods. Nematodes cause galls (knots) to form on both roots and pods of the peanut, and these galls are highly diagnostic for root-knot nematode presence compared to other nematodes affecting peanut. The presence of galls on roots, pegs and pods appears as single or multiple wart-like growths that may or may not be discolored. As root knot nematode infection progresses, and generally later in the season, secondary root and pod rots cause further damage and eventual death of the plants. Many soil-borne fungi, especially Sclerotium rolfsii (which causes southern stem rot) and Sclerotinia minor (which causes Sclerotinia blight), will infect the weakened peanut plants and cause more plant death. Root knot nematode infection of the peg weakens the peg so that it breaks during harvest, contributing to additional yield losses because the detached pods are then left in the soil. Infection of the pods leads to a decline in yield quality. The damage threshold, or the initial nematode population density at which peanut yields begin to decline, has been reported to be in the range of 1 to 10 eggs and second stage juveniles per 500 cm3 soil for M. arenaria on susceptible peanut cultivars.  Reproduction and life cycle  Reproduction occurs mitotically by parthenogenesis and the species has chromosome numbers that range from 30 to 50 The life cycle of all Meloidoigyne spp is similar but they have different temperature requirements. At temperatures ranging from 32.8 to 39.50C, M. arenaria reached the egg laying stage in about 21 days on peanut and completed its life cycle in 32 days. The population levels increased faster from a starting level of 10 juveniles per plant that from 1000 or 10,000 per plant. Adult females deposit eggs into a protective gelatinous matrix, near or just outside the root surface. A single female lays about 500 to 1,500 eggs during her life, which lasts about two to three months. Eggs hatch only under favorable conditions, such as adequate moisture and warm temperatures. Root knot nematode development begins inside the egg. After the completion of embryogenesis, the first-stage juvenile remains inside the egg until it molts into the second stage juvenile. The first stage juvenile (J1) lacks a stylet. Second stage juveniles (J2) hatch from the egg and move freely in the soil in quest for a suitable host plant. Once they find suitable host and enter the root with the help of the stylet, they start to feed within 24 hours, inducing giant cells to form. J2s then molt thrice (to J3, J4 and then the adult) before they mature in to adults. Adult males remain vermiform and get out of the root while females swell and obtain the pyriform/round shape. Females lay eggs in the gelatinous matrix which hatch again and the cycle is repeated if environmental conditions are favorable.Siddharth Tiwari and, Jon D. Eisenback, Roger R. Youngman, 2009. Root-knot Nematode in Field Corn Department of Entomology, Virginia Tech 2Department of Plant Pathology, Physiology, and Weed Science, Virginia Tech 3Extension Entomologist, Virginia Tech The length of the life cycle depends on environmental factors mostly temperature and host status. It may take about 1 month to complete the life cycle. The nematodes also have a very high reproductive rate.  Feeding behavior  Just like the other root knot nematodes, to be able to feed within the host, this nematode must establish an interaction with the plant. J2s are attracted to the root tip in the zone of elongation and the areas of lateral root emergence. Initially it was reported that they are attracted by CO2, and apparently by small molecules that are dialysable ‚Äì perhaps amino acids. Recent studies suggest that the attraction may not be to CO2 but to lower pH resulting from carbonic acid formed from the CO2 in solution. The second juvenile (J2) penetrates zone of elongation by mechanical (stylet thrusts) and probably chemical (cellulase and pectinase) means. It moves between, rather than through, cortical cells towards root apex, turns at the meristem, and migrates back to the vascular cylinder in the zone of cell differentiation. Once the J2 is in the root, they migrate intracellularly to the provascular cells and begin to parasitize cells within 24 hours. The nematode initiates formation of the giant cell (also called a nurse cell) from potential vascular tissue. Sub ventral gland become prominent after penetrating the root, and it could be playing a role of secreting enzymes that play a role in the formation of the giant cell which is a large cell with several nuclei. Giant cell are very large in size (100 fold increase), with reduced vacuoles and they are multinucleate containing about 40 to 100 nuclei. The female feeds from the giant cell as it expands further posteriorly accumulating eggs. After formation of the giant cells, gall development occurs though these two events are separate. Galls result from hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the cells around the giant cells. Growth regulators (IAA) are thought to have a role in cell enlargement since they increases cell wall plasticity.  Host range  M. arenaria parasitizes peanut, vegetables, grasses, fruit ornamentals and tobacco. The root-knot nematode, M. arenaria can infect almost every plant family. While characterizing the host range of the peanut root knot nematode, L√≥pez-P√©rez et al., 2011, reported that the most frequent hosts of the peanut root knot nematode were vegetables, fruit trees, tobacco, grapevine, and weeds.  Management  *Plant resistant cultivars: Although genes conferring resistance to peanut root knot nematode have not been found in cultivated peanut, other Arachis spp. have been identified to be highly resistant or immune to the peanut root knot nematode. Simpson and Starr (1991) and Garcia et al. (1996) reported successful crosses to transfer a high level of nematode resistance into A. hypogaea. The resistance was obtained from a wild species, Arachis cardenasii. Resistance was obtained by introgression of resistance genes into A. hypogaea using a series of backcrosses. Examples of resistant peanut varieties are COAN and NemaTAM. Both cultivars are highly susceptible to tomato spotted wilt virus and prevalent fungal diseases. In 2008, however, the USDA released a cultivar, Tifguard, which has resistance to both tomato spotted wilt virus and root-knot nematode. *Rotation with crops that are poor or non-hosts of the nematode. Two year rotations with cotton, bahai grass, or velvet bean are effective also. *Use of nematicides as needed. Management of root-knot nematodes on peanut has traditionally relied primarily on treatment of infested fields with nematicides such as granular aldicarb (Temik) or the fumigant 1,3-dichloropropene (Telone). Nematicides are usually recommended for high value crops such as peanuts, tobacco and peach.(http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/Mangmnt/Chemical.htm) *Plant tolerant varieties. Crop yields will not be affected even in the presence of M. arenaria. Promising ongoing research and other issues *Plant breeders and nematologists are actively pursuing the incorporation of the root-knot nematode resistance into varieties adapted to the disease situation in the southeastern U.S. Tifguard is the first of many future varieties that will be released from peanut breeding programs including the UF/IFAS peanut breeding program. These resistant varieties will not solve the peanut root knot nematode problems in peanut production; however, they hold great promise to reduce losses from this disease by more than 50%. *Since neither COAN nor NemaTAM are resistant to the tomato spotted wilt virus (Tospovirus, family Bunyaviridae), efforts to introgress resistance into other high yielding peanut varieties is ongoing. This will reduce crop losses in the areas with high incidences of the virus. The tomato spotted wilt virus, which causes substantial yield losses in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida.  Points to ponder  *The resistance in Tifguard and other varieties that will soon be released is the same single dominant gene. Continuous planting of peanut with this gene in the same fields is likely to eventually lead to resistance-breaking nematode biotypes. This can be delayed or prevented by utilizing proper crop rotation and even planting non-resistant peanut in the rotation as well. *Secondly, this resistance does not reduce damage from lesion nematodes which are a major problem in peanut production in the central peninsular production area of Florida.

They owe their name to their intuitive similarity with Haar wavelets and were used in the first real-time face detector.Viola and Jones, \\"Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features\\", Computer cool Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2001 Historically, working with only image intensities (i.e., the RGB pixel values at each and every pixel of image) made the task of feature calculation computationally expensive. A publication by Papageorgiou et al.Papageorgiou, Oren and Poggio, \\"A general framework for object detection\\", International Conference on Computer Vision, 1998. discussed working with an alternate feature set based on Haar wavelets instead of the usual image intensities. Paul Viola and Michael Jones adapted the idea of using Haar wavelets and developed the so-called Haar-like features. A Haar-like feature considers adjacent rectangular regions at a specific location in a detection window, sums up the pixel intensities in each region and calculates the difference between these sums. This difference is then used to categorize subsections of an image. For example, with a human face, it is a common observation that among all faces the region of the eyes is darker than the region of the cheeks. Therefore, a common Haar feature for face detection is a set of two adjacent rectangles that lie above the eye and the cheek region. The position of these rectangles is defined relative to a detection window that acts like a bounding box to the target object (the face in this case). In the detection phase of the Viola‚ÄìJones object detection framework, a window of the target size is moved over the input image, and for each subsection of the image the Haar-like feature is calculated. This difference is then compared to a learned threshold that separates non-objects from objects. Because such a Haar-like feature is only a weak learner or classifier (its detection quality is slightly better than random guessing) a large number of Haar-like features are necessary to describe an object with sufficient accuracy. In the Viola‚ÄìJones object detection framework, the Haar-like features are therefore organized in something called a classifier cascade to form a strong learner or classifier. The key advantage of a Haar-like feature over most other features is its calculation speed. Due to the use of integral images, a Haar-like feature of any size can be calculated in constant time (approximately 60 microprocessor instructions for a 2-rectangle feature).  Rectangular Haar- like features  A simple rectangular Haar-like feature can be defined as the difference of the sum of pixels of areas inside the rectangle, which can be at any position and scale within the original image. This modified feature set is called 2-rectangle feature. Viola and Jones also defined 3-rectangle features and 4-rectangle features. The values indicate certain characteristics of a particular area of the image. Each feature type can indicate the existence (or absence) of certain characteristics in the image, such as edges or changes in texture. For example, a 2-rectangle feature can indicate where the border lies between a dark region and a light region.  Fast computation of Haar-like features  One of the contributions of Viola and Jones was to use summed-area tables,Crow, F, \\"Summed-area tables for texture mapping\\", in Proceedings of SIGGRAPH, 18(3):207‚Äì212, 1984 which they called integral images. Integral images can be defined as two-dimensional lookup tables in the form of a matrix with the same size of the original image. Each element of the integral image contains the sum of all pixels located on the up-left region of the original image (in relation to the element's position). This allows to compute sum of rectangular areas in the image, at any position or scale, using only four lookups: Finding the sum of the shaded rectangular area : \\\\text{sum} = I(C) + I(A) - I(B) - I(D). \\\\, where points A, B, C, D belong to the integral image I, as shown in the figure. Each Haar-like feature may need more than four lookups, depending on how it was defined. Viola and Jones's 2-rectangle features need six lookups, 3-rectangle features need eight lookups, and 4-rectangle features need nine lookups.  Tilted Haar-like features  Lienhart and MaydtLienhart, R. and Maydt, J., \\"An extended set of Haar-like features for rapid object detection\\", ICIP02, pp. I: 900‚Äì903, 2002 introduced the concept of a tilted (45¬∞) Haar-like feature. This was used to increase the dimensionality of the set of features in an attempt to improve the detection of objects in images. This was successful, as some of these features are able to describe the object in a better way. For example, a 2-rectangle tilted Haar-like feature can indicate the existence of an edge at 45¬∞. Messom and BarczakMessom, C.H. and Barczak, A.L.C., \\"Fast and Efficient Rotated Haar-like Features Using Rotated Integral Images\\", Australian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA2006), pp. 1‚Äì6, 2006 extended the idea to a generic rotated Haar-like feature. Although the idea is sound mathematically, practical problems prevent the use of Haar-like features at any angle. In order to be fast, detection algorithms use low resolution images introducing rounding errors. For this reason rotated Haar-like features are not commonly used. References * Haar A.

The widespread genus contains 28 species. The genus was formally described by J. W. Carmichael in 1966. Exophiala has been implicated in causing 'saxophone lung' or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease that can be contracted by woodwind instrumentalists (saxophonists, clarinettists, oboists, etc.). A case study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology highlighted that it is possible to develop this allergic pulmonary disease through improper cleaning of instruments.http://www.livescience.com/41057-what-is-saxophone-lung- hypersensitivity-pneumonitis.html Exophiala werneckii is the organism responsible for tinea nigra. Some sources equate Hortaea werneckii, Cladosporium werneckii, Exophiala werneckii, and Phaeoannellomyces werneckii. Exophiala jeanselmei causes maduromycosis. This is usually an asymtomatic disease which presents with black or brown macular lesions which enlarge by peripheral extension. The lesion is darkest at the periphery and has very distinct margins.

Four varieties have been discovered: Exophiala jeanselmei var. heteromorpha, E. jeanselmei var. lecanii-corni, E. jeanselmei var. jeanselmei, and E. jeanselmei var. castellanii. Other species in the genus Exophiala such as E. dermatitidis and E. spinifera have been reported to have similar annellidic conidiogenesis and may therefore be difficult to differentiate. History Exophiala jeanselmei was first isolated in 1928 by Jeanselme from a case of black mycetoma on the foot. The nomenclature was based on the fungus' morphological characteristics, hence, it was originally classified as Torula jeanselmei because of its yeast like shape when grown in culture. It was later reclassified by McGinnis and Padhye in 1977 as Exophiala jeanselmei after further research on conidiogenesis. Morphology In culture, E. jeanselmei produces slow growing colonies that are green black in color. Cultures manifest a combination of mycelial and yeast-like growth forms, however the yeast-like typically predominates. Black aerial mycelium develops on the colony surface that consists of hyphae with swellings at regular intervals. Conidia are variable in size and are often formed in clusters at the tip of annellidic conidiogenous cells. The conidia are narrowly ellipsoidal in shape and 2.6-5.9 ¬µm √ó 1.2-2.5 ¬µm in size. Immature sexual fruiting bodies called ascomata have been reported but their rare occurrence are thought to be due to the lack of mating compatibility. Exophiala jeanselmei is affiliated with the ascomycete genus Capronia. Ecology Exophiala jeanselmei is commonly found in soil, plants, water, and can also be isolated from decaying wood as this fungus is a saprotroph in nature. This species has world-wide occurrence but are particularly noted in Asia and more commonly in tropical and subtropical regions. The genus Exophiala has been isolated from hydrocarbon rich environments as well as from hot, humid, and oligotrophic environments such as dishwashers, steam bath facilities and bathrooms that only provide low levels of nutrients. It has been proposed that the conditions usually found within dishwashers such as high temperature, moisture and alkaline pH can provide an alternative habitat for human pathogenic species. The fungus has optimal growth at 30 ¬∞C but growth is inhibited at 40 ¬∞C. Most strains isolated from soil cannot grow at temperatures higher than 30 ¬∞C while strains isolated from humans can grow at higher temperatures such as 37 ¬∞C of the human body. This adaptation of E. jeanselmei had developed evolutionarily in order to survive on their human hosts. This is a distinguishing factor that helps in determining the pathogenicity of a particular strain. A feature that distinguishes E. jeanselmei from Cladosporium which forms very similar colonies is that E. jeanselmei is not proteolytic. It is able to assimilate glucose, galactose, maltose, and sucrose, but not lactose. Pathogenesis Exophiala jeanselmei has versatile adaptability and acts as an opportunistic pathogen. Infections are more common in immunocompromised people and can also have manifestations in healthy people with wounded skin via traumatic implantation. Chronic steroid use has been found to increase the severity of inflammation. There were also cases where infections by E. jeanselmei occurred during solid organ transplants. Infections frequently cause inflammation in the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues of the skin, causing phaeomycotic cyst, chromoblastomycosis and can occasionally cause eumycetoma which is a chronic granulomatous disease in the form of black grains. Mycetoma, a common form of clinical manifestation of E. jeanselmei, is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease that forms abscess and draining sinuses in more advanced stages. In mycotic mycetoma, vesicles of cyst like structures are formed. Dissemination, endocarditis and arthritis could arise from an opportunistic infection by E. jeanselmei, and it was also isolated from phaeohyphomycosis with sclerotic round bodies. There have been several cases of E. jeanselmei being the etiological agent of phaeohyphomycosis in domesticated cats where diagnoses were confirmed by sequencing the fungus' ribosomal RNA. The grains of this fungus are small, black in color and have soft centers. Rare cases of keratitis, infection of the cornea, have also identified E. jeanselmei as the etiological agent. In vitro susceptibility and treatment The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fluconazole for E. jeanselmei is very high, flucytosine and miconazole also have relatively high MICs which indicate that the fungus is fairly resistant to these drugs. Amphotericin B, ketoconazole, and voriconazole have lower MICs, and E. jeanselmei is most susceptible to itraconazole and terbinafine. Novel drugs such as echinocandin and caspofungin also have favorable antifungal activity against Exophiala jeanselmei isolates. However, in vitro susceptibility in comparison to the efficacy of antifungal agents in clinical manifestations of this fungus is currently unknown, that in vitro success may or may not directly correlate clinically. Previous cases of black grain mycetoma caused by E. jeanselmei were clinically treated and cases of phaeohyphomycosis caused by this fungus were completely cured where both cases were remedied by administering itraconazole. E. jeanselmei also showed some susceptibility to being treated with antifungal agents such as amphotericin B, voriconazole and posaconazole. Amphotericin B used to be the most potent antifungal treatment for severe fungal infections, but due to its strong association with severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity, its use is now often replaced with azoles and echinocandins. The use of combinations of surgical excision and pharmacological treatments for severe infections is usually the preferred way to treat diseases caused by this fungus.

Since forming in 1991, the band has released four albums and an EP. The band split in 2005, but has reformed once more for an East Coast Australian tour in support of its final album On Demon Wings in 2009.  Background  The group was formed in 1991 by bassist Damon Robinson and guitarist Scott Edgar, who had both been members of earlier Brisbane groups Guardian, Northwinds, Savage, A.I.M. and Black Magic. The band's first line-up featured Robinson, Edgar, drummer Anthony Dwyer, Northwinds guitarist Brad Allen, and vocalist Darren Goulding. Allen was soon replaced by Laszlo Khaninghinis, and the band recorded two demos in 1992 - Sorting of the Insects and Astern Diabolus before releasing their first album A Necessary Evil in 1993. Soon after the album's release, Misery's reputation as a heavy act was immediately established, and the band undertook its first national tour in support of Pungent Stench. Goulding was fired from the group not long after the tour, to be replaced by former Mausoleum vocalist Moises Contreras. Goulding would later go on to front Sydney band Sulkus, Wagga Wagga death metal group Manticore, and Sydney nu-metal outfit Art Imitates Crime. In 1994, the band released the Insidious EP with Contreras on vocals; its accompanying video clip Torn was banned from television airplay. Supports with Deicide and Morbid Angel, and an appearance at the Big Day Out festival soon followed. Contreras' stay with the band would also be short-lived, and after his departure Robinson decided to take up the band's vocal duties himself. Contreras would go on to form melodic death metallers Sakkuth. In 1997, Misery signed to Sydney metal label Warhead Records and released their second album Revel In Blasphemy, which is regarded by many as Misery's heaviest recorded work. More touring followed, with the band playing Metal for the Brain. Another album's worth of material was set for release by 1998, but due to Warhead Records ceasing operation at the time, third album Curses would not see release until 2000 through Venomous Records. Throughout the 2000s, the members of Misery began to busy themselves with other projects. Edgar played in a group called Soundsurgery, while Kananghinis formed punk rock group Greensteam, and Robinson recorded a demo with doom metallers Cardinal Sin. All the members of Misery also began a Mot√∂rhead cover group called White Line Fever, which they would play sets of at their own shows. After a tour of New Zealand in 2001, Kananghinis left Misery to focus on Greensteam full-time. The band continued as a three-piece until 2005, when Robinson left Australia to live in the United States. Misery's fourth and final album On Demon Wings was released through Brisbane label Obsidian Records in 2007. In 2005 Edgar formed The Dead, but left in 2008 after one album, and later formed a new band with Dwyer called Laceration Mantra. Misery regrouped in March 2009 for an East Coast tour in support of On Demon Wings with Adelaide doom metal group Mournful Congregation. As of 2017, Misery reformed for a \\"one off\\" Brisbane reunion show in support of European black metallers, TAAKE.

It is served by the Wairarapa Connection, and sees five services each way Monday to Thursday, six on Friday and two on Saturday and Sunday. This station was initially known as Mangaroa and received its present name on 26 January 1959. History This station officially opened on 3 November 1955 along with the Rimutaka Deviation and Rimutaka Tunnel, and the original Mangaroa railway station was closed. The ground on which the station is located was created using fill extracted during the construction of the Rimutaka Tunnel. During construction of the tunnel, a crossing loop long enough to accommodate 116 wagons and a temporary connection to the now closed section of the Wairarapa Line were built to enable work trains to bring in materials and supplies. The connection between the old and new lines was lifted along with the old line, but the loop remained in use for many years afterwards for operational reasons. Northbound (up) passenger services used the loop and second platform, while southbound (down) passenger services used the main line and first platform. Both platforms had identical wooden passenger shelters on them. In 1990 part of the loop was lifted, reducing it to a siding, and it was completely removed by August 1999. As part of the Wairarapa station upgrade program to accommodate the SW-class carriages for the Wairarapa Connection, this station was renovated in 2007 with works completed by the end of August that year. Selective door opening is employed at Maymorn since the platform is only long enough to fit three carriages (guards check while collecting tickets re any for Maymorn). The station's wooden passenger shelter suffered extensive fire damage on 17 July 2008 in a suspected arson. As it was judged uneconomic to repair the building, it was demolished the following week. A new glass shelter was installed on the site of the old wooden shelter during the evening of Monday 18 May 2009. Today Maymorn railway station main platform (left) and disused second platform (right), looking east. Nothing remains of the crossing loop, and all sidings have also been lifted. Despite this, there is still evidence of the former presence of the loop including the second platform, the gap between it and the main line, and the extra-wide Maymorn Road overpass. There is a passenger shelter on the main line platform (the shelter on the second platform has long been removed), a couple of equipment buildings, and a shed for a surfaceman's trolley. On 14 November 2009 the Rimutaka Incline Railway excavated the back of the second (disused) platform to both retrieve fill and to make way for the formation of their own rail yard. From the station, an embankment on which the old line ran can be seen just past the end of Old School Road, and now has a fence line running along its apex. Hikers can access the old railway formation using an access road which starts near the station, from the corner of Maymorn Road and Parkes Line Road. At the top of the access road, where it meets the formation, the remains of the Dry Creek Gully bridge which carried the line over a washout, are to the right but obscured by dense foliage. Future On 14 July 2005 the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust secured a 20-year heritage lease on land at the Maymorn railway yards from KiwiRail. The trust proposes to reinstate the world-famous Rimutaka Incline, with its base of operations established at Maymorn, and is currently working through stage one of the project including preparing the yard, construction of buildings, fencing and platelaying. This will also include a rail connection of approximately in length between the station and the original railway formation, for which their preferred option is to lay their own line over the Maymorn Road overpass next to the current main line. In 2003, the Greater Wellington Regional Council proposed extending double-track from Trentham to Upper Hutt and extending electrification north of Upper Hutt to Timberlea and Cruickshank Road. A 2011 strategy published by the Upper Hutt City Council proposes extending electrification to Maymorn, to capture planned growth in the area. As part of the New Zealand Upgrade Programme announced by the government on 29 January 2020, a new passing loop will be installed at Maymorn.

It was a separate municipality, but became administratively a part of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n in 1947. The name is derived from the ≈õwiba bush, from the cornus genius.  History  Svibice in 1907 The village was first mentioned in 1461 as Swibiczi. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1,065 in 1880 to 2,386 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish- speakers (at most 79.2% in 1890, later dropping to 67.3% in 1910) accompanied by a German-speaking minority (growing in number from 212 or 20.6% in 1880 to 715 or 30.9% in 1910) and Czech-speaking people (at most 41 or 1.8% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (61%), followed by Protestants (37.4%), Jews (35 or 1.5%) and 3 people adhering to another faiths. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Before 1920 the village of B≈Çogocice was administratively a part of Svibice. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. In 1947 Svibice was submerged with ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n. During the communist era a massive construction of so-called panel√°ks occurred and Svibice was transformed into an urban neighbourhood. Some old houses still remain, although the majority of the population of Svibice live in panel√°ks.

His highest rank was sekiwake, which he held for one tournament in 1970. He won the top division championship in January 1972. After retirement he worked as a coach at his stable, Kasugano, until 1990 when he set up his own Tamanoi stable. He is the father of the former ≈çzeki Tochiazuma Daisuke, and upon his retirement as a coach in 2009 his son took over from him. Career He made his debut in November 1960, joining the then recently retired yokozuna Tochinishiki's Kasugano stable. He reached j≈´ry≈ç in May 1965 and the top makuuchi division in March 1967. He was relatively small, standing only 177 cm tall and weighing around 110 kg. In May 1968 he was runner-up to Tamanoshima with a 10‚Äì5 record, earning promotion to komusubi. He also won the first of his six Gin≈ç-sh≈ç or Technique Awards. He was runner-up once again in September of that year. He reached his highest rank of sekiwake in March 1970 but fell short with a 7‚Äì8 record. He had the unusual experience in January 1971 of defeating a yokozuna on the opening day, and then losing 13 of his remaining 14 bouts, with his only other win being a walkover. In January 1972, ranked at maegashira 5, he took his only top division y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship. He needed only an 11‚Äì4 record to do so (13 or 14 wins are normally needed). The sole yokozuna at the time, Kitanofuji, withdrew after winning only seven matches, and the only ≈çzeki Tochiazuma faced was Kiyokuni on the final day. He won the match, avoiding the need for a playoff with Wajima, Kotozakura, Hasegawa, Fukunohana, Yoshioyama and Wakafutase who all finished runners up on 10‚Äì5. Had Kiyokuni won, he would have also been involved in an eight-way playoff. After his tournament victory he was promoted back to komusubi but pulled out of the next tournament through injury and spent the rest of his career in the maegashira ranks. He was runner-up for a third time in May 1973, but was not really in contention for the championship during the tournament, finishing four wins behind the undefeated Wajima. Retirement from sumo His son, Daisuke, was born in November 1976. Tochiazuma retired two months later, during the January 1977 tournament. He remained in sumo as an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, working as a coach at his old stable. In 1990, following the death of his old stablemaster, he decided to branch out and open up his own Tamanoi stable. The purpose-built heya has some of the best facilities in sumo today. His son joined the stable in 1994 and adopted his old shikona of Tochiazuma. His son won his first tournament championship in January 2002, exactly 30 years after Tamanoi Oyakata's own triumph, and retired in May 2007. He took over the running of the stable when Tamanoi reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 in September 2009.

All species of Trichosporon are yeasts with no known teleomorphs (sexual states). Most are typically isolated from soil, but several species occur as a natural part of the skin microbiota of humans and other animals. Proliferation of Trichosporon yeasts in the hair can lead to an unpleasant but non-serious condition known as white piedra. Trichosporon species can also cause severe opportunistic infections (trichosporonosis) in immunocompromised individuals. Taxonomy The genus was first described by the German dermatologist Gustav Behrend in 1890, based on yeasts isolated from the hairs of a moustache where they were causing the condition known as \\"white piedra\\". Behrend called his new species T. ovoides, but subsequently Pleurococcus beigelii (later recombined as Trichosporon beigelii) was considered to be an earlier name for the same species and was accepted as the type of the genus Trichosporon. Over 100 additional yeast species were referred to Trichosporon by later authors. With the advent of DNA sequencing, however, it became clear that many of these additional species belonged in other genera. Based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, just under 40 species are now accepted in the genus. DNA sequencing has also shown that white piedra can be caused by more than one Trichoporon species. As a result, Trichosporon beigelii has become a name of uncertain application. McPartland & Goff selected a neotype strain that makes T. beigelii synonymous with Trichosporon cutaneum. Gu√©ho and others, however, have argued that T. beigelii should be discarded (as a dubious name) and Behrend's original T. ovoides (for which a neotype strain has also been selected) should become the type. As a result of this uncertainty, the name T. beigelii is now obsolete. Description and habitat Trichosporon species are distinguished microscopically by having yeast cells that germinate to produce hyaline hyphae that disarticulate at the septa, the hyphal compartments acting as arthroconidia (asexual propagules). No teleomorphic (sexual) states are known. Species are widespread and have been isolated from a wide range of substrates, including human hair (Trichosporon ovoides), soil (T. guehoae), cabbages (T. brassicae), cheese (T. caseorum), scarab beetles (T. scarabaeorum), parrot droppings (T. coremiiforme), and sea water (T. dermatis). Human pathogens Several Trichosporon species occur naturally as part of the microbiota of human skin. Occasionally, particularly in circumstances of high humidity, the fungus can proliferate, causing an unpleasant but harmless hair condition known as white piedra. Soft, pale nodules containing yeast cells and arthroconidia form on hairs of the scalp and body. The species responsible include Trichosporon ovoides, T. inkin, T. asahii, T. mucoides, T. asteroides, and T. cutaneum. The obsolete name T. beigelii was formerly applied to all or any of these species. Much more serious opportunistic infections, collectively called trichosporonosis, have been reported in immunocompromised individuals. Species said to be agents of trichosporonosis are T. asahii, T. asteroides, T. cutaneum, T.dermatis, T. dohaense, T. inkin, T. loubieri, T. mucoides, and T. ovoides.

Like other stubby-root nematodes, this species is microscopic, reaching up to 0.71 millimeters in length.Paratrichodorus minor. Nemaplex. University of California, Davis. Its body is rounded at both ends. It has an onchiostyle, a curved, solid stylet which it uses to puncture plant roots. It stabs the plant tissue rapidly, up to 10 times per second, to make a hole. It injects saliva, which hardens into a hollow tube, and it uses this like a drinking straw to withdraw the contents of the plant cells. It moves around the root, leaving old tubes in place and creating new ones. It is an ectoparasite, attacking the plant externally rather than entering its tissues. Damage to plants is evident when it stops the roots from growing, leaving the root system \\"stubby\\"-looking. A plant cannot obtain water and nutrients from the soil and becomes stunted and wilted. It shows signs of nutrient deficiency. An affected crop field may have patches of withered plants. The nematode also introduces viruses to plants, including tobacco rattle virus, which causes the disease corky ringspot in potatoes. A potato tuber with corky ringspot has large brown rings on its surface and discolored spots inside. Entire potato crops can be made unmarketable by the appearance of the disease. The nematode has been observed in over 100 plant hosts, including turfgrasses such as St. Augustine grass and bermudagrass, vegetables such as cabbage and tomato, and other crops such as corn, sorghum, sugarcane, peanut, and soybean. It is a pest of vineyards in California. It is most abundant in coarse soils. Most individuals of the species are female and they reproduce by parthenogenesis, producing offspring without fertilization. They lay eggs in the soil and the juveniles feed on roots as they develop. The length of the life cycle varies with temperature, but it may be as short as 16 days.

The Sri Lankan Government accuses the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) of committing the crime.Sri Lanka: The Northeast: Human rights violations in a context of armed conflict The attack is widely attributed to LTTE, who denied their involvement in the massacre, and have never retracted that denial. Background The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, is a militant rebel organization which had been fighting the Sri Lankan Civil War since 1975 in order to establish a separate state in the North and East of the country. Peace talks which began in 1989 broke down ending a 13-month ceasefire. On 11 June the LTTE attacked numerous government targets such as Police stations. On June 26, LTTE militants looted 93 shops in Kattankudy, burning 3 of them. On 24 July armed persons murdered four Muslims at a mosque in the Batticaloa District. On 29 July armed persons killed 10 worshipers in Sammanthurai, 25 miles east of the town of Batticaloa. Sri Lankan military officials claimed it was done by the LTTE. They also claimed the LTTE attacked Muslim villages, and burning their shops and homes, on the basis of suspecting them of supporting the government. Incident On 3 August around 30 heavily armed Tamil rebels crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Kattankudy. An LTTE tax collector, Ranjith Appah, had visited the house of Jinnah Hadjiaar, where LTTE gunmen shot his son-in-law dead. At around 8:10pm, the rebels entered the Meer Jumma Masjid, Hussainiya, Masjid-Jul-Noor and Fowzie Mosques, where hundreds of devotees were attending Friday Isha prayers. The persons were disguised as Muslims to avoid suspicion. As the civilians knelt in prayer when the Tamil rebels attacked them, spraying automatic fire and hurling hand grenades at the worshipers. Most of the victims were shot in the back or side. The rebels fled as Sri Lankan soldiers, notified of the ongoing massacre, arrived at the scene. The army had delayed in reaching the town, citing the possibility of landmines as the reason. This led to some Kattankudy residents suspecting the army was somehow involved in the massacre. Initial report put the death toll at around 100, but as many of the injured who were rushed to hospital succumbed to their injuries, the final death toll rose to over 147. Eyewitness accounts Harrowing eyewitness accounts appeared in the international press over the next few days. Speaking to the New York Times, Mohammed Ibrahim, a 40-year-old businessman said: Mohammed Arif, a 17-year-old student who also survived the massacre told the New York Times: Aftermath Then Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa directed Sri Lanka Air Force helicopters to rush the injured to hospitals for urgent treatment. They continued to ferry the injured to hospitals throughout the next morning. Soon after the massacre, government troops launched an operation in the area to capture the killers. One of the helicopters involved in the search shot at two boat loads of LTTE rebels off the sea at Kattankudi. They were believed to be fleeing to India following the massacre. Casualties amongst the rebels were not confirmed. The incident was the worst massacre of civilians since the resumption the conflict on 11 June. All the victims were buried in a cemetery at the Meera Jumma Mosque, where mourners dug a long common grave for a row of coffins. LTTE denied responsibility and alleged that it was done by the government to get arms from the Islamic countries.

This structured information is made available on the World Wide Web. DBpedia allows users to semantically query relationships and properties of wikipedia resources, including links to other related datasets. Tim Berners-Lee described DBpedia as one of the most famous parts of the decentralized Linked Data effort.  Background  The project was started by people at the Free University of Berlin and Leipzig UniversityDBpedia: A Nucleus for a Web of Open Data, available at , , or , in collaboration with OpenLink Software, and is now maintained by people at the University of Mannheim and Leipzig University.https://wiki.dbpedia.org/about/dbpedia-community The first publicly available dataset was published in 2007. The data is made available under free licences (CC-BY-SA), allowing others to reuse the dataset; it doesn't however use an open data license to waive the sui generis database rights. wikipedia articles consist mostly of free text, but also include structured information embedded in the articles, such as \\"infobox\\" tables (the pull-out panels that appear in the top right of the default view of many wikipedia articles, or at the start of the mobile versions), categorisation information, images, geo- coordinates and links to external Web pages. This structured information is extracted and put in a uniform dataset which can be queried.  Dataset  The 2016-04 release of the DBpedia data set describes 6.0 million entities, out of which 5.2 million are classified in a consistent ontology, including 1.5M persons, 810k places, 135k music albums, 106k films, 20k video games, 275k organizations, 301k species and 5k diseases. DBpedia uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to represent extracted information and consists of 9.5 billion RDF triples, of which 1.3 billion were extracted from the English edition of wikipedia and 5.0 billion from other language editions. From this data set, information spread across multiple pages can be extracted. For example, book authorship can be put together from pages about the work, or the author. One of the challenges in extracting information from wikipedia is that the same concepts can be expressed using different parameters in infobox and other templates, such as and . Because of this, queries about where people were born would have to search for both of these properties in order to get more complete results. As a result, the DBpedia Mapping Language has been developed to help in mapping these properties to an ontology while reducing the number of synonyms. Due to the large diversity of infoboxes and properties in use on wikipedia, the process of developing and improving these mappings has been opened to public contributions. Version 2014 was released in September 2014. A main change since previous versions was the way abstract texts were extracted. Specifically, running a local mirror of wikipedia and retrieving rendered abstracts from it made extracted texts considerably cleaner. Also, a new data set extracted from Wikimedia Commons was introduced. By 2017, DBpedia had become one of the biggest representatives of Linked Open Data (LOD).  Examples  DBpedia extracts factual information from wikipedia pages, allowing users to find answers to questions where the information is spread across multiple wikipedia articles. Data is accessed using an SQL-like query language for RDF called SPARQL. For example, imagine you were interested in the Japanese sh≈çjo manga series Tokyo Mew Mew, and wanted to find the genres of other works written by its illustrator. DBpedia combines information from wikipedia's entries on Tokyo Mew Mew, Mia Ikumi and on works such as Super Doll Licca-chan and Koi Cupid. Since DBpedia normalises information into a single database, the following query can be asked without needing to know exactly which entry carries each fragment of information, and will list related genres: PREFIX dbprop: PREFIX db: SELECT ?who, ?WORK, ?genre WHERE { db:Tokyo_Mew_Mew dbprop:author ?who . ?WORK dbprop:author ?who . OPTIONAL { ?WORK dbprop:genre ?genre } . }  Use cases  DBpedia has a broad scope of entities covering different areas of human knowledge. This makes it a natural hub for connecting datasets, where external datasets could link to its concepts.E. Curry, A. Freitas, and S. O‚ÄôRi√°in, \\"The Role of Community-Driven Data Curation for Enterprises,\\" in Linking Enterprise Data, D. Wood, Ed. Boston, MA: Springer US, 2010, pp. 25-47. The DBpedia dataset is interlinked on the RDF level with various other Open Data datasets on the Web. This enables applications to enrich DBpedia data with data from these datasets. , there are more than 45 million interlinks between DBpedia and external datasets including: Freebase, OpenCyc, UMBEL, GeoNames, MusicBrainz, CIA World Fact Book, DBLP, Project Gutenberg, DBtune Jamendo, Eurostat, UniProt, Bio2RDF, and US Census data. The Thomson Reuters initiative OpenCalais, the Linked Open Data project of The New York Times, the Zemanta API and DBpedia Spotlight also include links to DBpedia. The BBC uses DBpedia to help organize its content. Faviki uses DBpedia for semantic tagging. Samsung also includes DBpedia in its \\"Knowledge Sharing Platform\\". Such a rich source of structured cross-domain knowledge is fertile ground for Artificial Intelligence systems. DBpedia was used as one of the knowledge sources in IBM Watson's Jeopardy! winning system David Ferrucci, Eric Brown, Jennifer Chu-Carroll, James Fan, David Gondek, Aditya A.

Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Amazon provides a DBpedia Public Data Set that can be integrated into Amazon Web Services applications. Semantic structure of DBpedia with quality metrics can help in building methods for automatic enrichment of less developed language versions of wikipedia. Data about creators from DBpedia can be used for enriching artworks‚Äô sales observations. The crowdsourcing software company, Ushahidi, built a prototype of its software that leveraged DBpedia to perform semantic annotations on citizen-generated reports. The prototype incorporated the \\"YODIE\\" (Yet another Open Data Information Extraction system) service developed by the University of Sheffield, which uses DBpedia to perform the annotations. The goal for Ushahidi was to improve the speed and facility with which incoming reports could be validated managed.  DBpedia Spotlight  DBpedia Spotlight is a tool for annotating mentions of DBpedia resources in text. This allows linking unstructured information sources to the Linked Open Data cloud through DBpedia. DBpedia Spotlight performs named entity extraction, including entity detection and name resolution (in other words, disambiguation). It can also be used for named entity recognition, and other information extraction tasks. DBpedia Spotlight aims to be customizable for many use cases. Instead of focusing on a few entity types, the project strives to support the annotation of all 3.5million entities and concepts from more than 320 classes in DBpedia. The project started in June 2010 at the Web Based Systems Group at the Free University of Berlin. DBpedia Spotlight is publicly available as a web service for testing and a Java/Scala API licensed via the Apache License. The DBpedia Spotlight distribution includes a jQuery plugin that allows developers to annotate pages anywhere on the Web by adding one line to their page. Clients are also available in Java or PHP. The tool handles various languages through its demo page and web services. Internationalization is supported for any language that has a wikipedia edition.  History  DBpedia was initiated in 2007 by S√∂ren Auer, Christian Bizer, Georgi Kobilarov, Jens Lehmann, Richard Cyganiak and Zachary Ives.

Originally a tributary of the Kifissos River, it has been rechanneled to the sea. It is now largely channeled underground, though as of June 2019 there are plans to unearth the river. Etymology Its name is in all probability Pre-Greek: it features the ending -s√≥s/-ss√≥s/-tt√≥s, which it shares with many other toponyms in Attica and other rivers in Greece, all of which are considered linguistic substratum survivals. Ancient Athens During antiquity, the river flowed outside the defensive walls of Athens: Plato wrote in Critias that the river was one of the borders of the ancient walls. Its banks‚Äîin the busy intersection that presently features the Hilton Hotel and the National Gallery‚Äîwere grassy and shaded by plane trees, and were considered idyllic in antiquity; they were the favored haunts of Socrates for his walks and teaching. The temple of , a local hero, was located there, giving its name to the modern suburb of Pagkrati. Ilisos was also considered a demi-god, the son of Poseidon and Demetra, and was worshipped in a sanctuary on the Ardittos Hill, next to the current Panathinaiko Stadium. This area was named Cynosarges in antiquity and the spring of was located there. Modern route River Ilisos and Stadion Bridge, ca. 1900 Chapel of Saint Photeini and the River Ilisos The stream drains the western slopes of Mount Hymettus, and originates from multiple converging seasonal creeks. As urban Athens expanded during the 19th and early 20th centuries, the river became a source of pollution and was converted gradually into a rainwater runoff conduit, covered with streets that track its original, twisting route along the lay of the land. Its bed proper flows under Mesogeion Avenue at the Old Gendarmerie Academy, flows under Michalakopoulou (the modern-day Ilisia suburb) and Vasileos Konstantinou Avenues, and passes in front of the Panathinaiko Stadium, where it was bridged during the 19th century. It then flows to the southeastern flank of the ruined Columns of Olympian Zeus, where it is still visible amidst reed beds, next to the Byzantine chapel of Saint Photeini \\"of the Ilisos\\". In older times the river at this point expanded into shallow marshland, termed (; lit. \\"Frog Island\\") in the vicinity of the ancient spring of , now submerged under Avenue Kallirois. As is the case for the majority of the Christian churches in Greece, the church of Aghia Foteini, established in 1872, is built on the ruins of an ancient temple, dedicated to Hecate. Archaeological finds of 2014 identified the ruins of yet another temple, of the 4th Century B.C., dedicated to Zeus, \\"\\", in the vicinity of that of the 5th C. B.C. ionic temple of Artemis (Diana) Agrotera, slightly higher up on the same slope of the hill, which is thought to have been called \\"Agrai\\". It was here that the goddess was celebrated every year on the anniversary of the Battle of Marathon. The Archon in charge would offer goats for sacrifice and the tithe of the sale of war prisoners, while the Athenian youth passed in procession. The importance of this hill was due to the Lesser Mysteries, celebrated every year during the month of Anthesterion (February‚ÄìMarch) as a form of initiation of the Great Eleusinian Mysteries. The Hill of Agrai extends as far as the Stadion and is known by the name of Ardettos or Helicon. Here there is also the Shrine of the God Pan. This rocky outcrop with a small natural cave and two perpendicular faces was found to have a relief of the god Pan. This deity of wild nature was worshiped regularly in caves and rocky terrain. Pan is depicted striding to the right with the \\"pipes of Pan\\" in his right hand and a stick for hunting hares on the left. Others believe that this is the Shrine of the Nymphs and the river god Acheloos, with a spring of cold water, a plane tree and a willow, where, as Plato writes, Socrates and Phaedros sat during their philosophical chats. It then flows under Theseos Avenue, in the suburb of Kallithea, its original course turning sharply northwest to join the Kifissos River, of which it was once a tributary. The Ilisos is now routed straight to sea, coming to surface and flowing into the Saronic Gulf in the middle of Phaleron Bay.

It killed seven people, including a probationary firefighter. Hotel The Worsley Hotel was a series of interconnecting houses of four or five storeys comprising Nos 3-19 Clifton Gardens, Maida Vale, London W9, a road of Edwardian houses between Warwick Avenue and Maida Vale, London. At the time of the fire, it was used by the hotel industry to house hotel and catering employees, many of whom were of foreign origin and working or training in hotels in Central London. Fire In the early hours of Friday 13 December 1974, (as it turned out) two fires were deliberately lit in the hotel. Several occupants were aroused by the smell of smoke, and on discovering fire raised the alarm as best they could, before leaving the building. One resident tried to extinguish one of these fires while it was still small, but he did not know how to operate the fire extinguisher which he found. The first of several 999 calls were made to the London Fire Brigade at 03:32 and received by the local fire station, A21, Paddington, who were ordered to the scene along with neighbouring A22, Manchester Square and G26 Belsize, bringing the first attendance of four pumping appliances (two were pumps - P, two were pump escapes - PE, carrying the heavy but stable 50 foot (15m) wheeled escape ladders), a 100 ft (30m) turntable ladder - TL (aerial ladder) and an emergency tender - ET (for the breathing apparatus (BA) sets carried; BA wearing was then still a specialist skill). On arrival, a chaotic scene greeted the senior officer, a serious fire in progress and numerous persons needing rescue. A priority message was made to control and a \\"Make pumps 8\\" message was sent (requesting a further four pumping appliances in addition to the original four) within minutes of first arriving, whilst rescues (the priority) were being made from both the front and rear of the building. Access was impeded by parked cars. Further reinforcements were requested, first to 15 pumps, and then 20, and finally 30 with a further two turntable ladders requested. During the next hour, the building structure began to deteriorate as floors and roof structures became affected by fire. This was particularly apparent in house numbers 13, 15, and 17, the worst affected. Many of the internal stairways were stone and when heated by the fire and then suddenly cooled by water collapsed making internal movement through the building awkward and potentially hazardous. Two trapped residents escaped by jumping from high windows: one into the slender topmost branches of a tree, one across a gap onto a fireman's ladder. As further crews arrived along with increasingly senior officers to direct operations and persons were accounted for, the operation moved from rescue to fighting the fire. Crews took hoses through the doors from the street and off ladders through the windows. One of these fire fighting crews, made up of 3 firemen and a Station Officer, entered a second floor room to search out the seat of the fire. Whilst in the room, several floors above, weakened by the extra load of the partially collapsed roof and of a large water tank, came down on the crew, the devastation seemingly concentrated on that one room. The release of the trapped firemen became the priority, with what proved to be a difficult and protracted rescue operation. One by one, three firemen were released (two with serious burns and one with a serious back injury) before the body of the fourth fireman was found. 25-year-old Fm. Hamish Pettit from Rochester, Kent, who attended the fire with Red Watch A21 Paddington, was declared dead at the scene. The six other dead were residents on upper floors, which the fire had quickly spread to; their bodies were found after the fire was out. The incident was the first major incident dealt with by the control room at Wembley since their computerized mobilising system was commissioned; it had only gone live earlier that week. The final attendance involved 30 pumping appliances, 3 turntable ladders, 3 emergency tenders and other specialist vehicles such as hose layers for relaying water long distances, including from the nearby Regents Canal at Little Venice. The \\"stop\\" message (= \\"incident under control\\") was despatched at 08:02 that morning, but damping down and standby attendance went on for some days. The incident proved to be the largest fire in Central London that year, and resulted in one of the largest number of fire brigade bravery commendations from a single incident. Four of the firemen later received awards from the Queen. =London Fire Brigade attendance= This is a summary of the fire appliances (fire engines) as they were despatched to the scene. A \\"Make Pumps...\\" call in the UK fire service is a request for further reinforcements. All times quoted are in the 24-hour clock format.

Eight further pumps were requested at 05:56 to relieve the initial crews and to assist in damping down operations. As was the practice, the fire was also attended by the London Salvage Corps, whose principal task was damage control and to limit damage to property. This insurance industry funded organisation was abolished in 1984. All fire station codes quoted were those in use in 1974. Some codes have subsequently changed and some stations have since closed. Deaths Seven people died in the fire. These were: *Fireman Hamish Pettit, London Fire Brigade, aged 25 from Rochester, Kent, UK; *Patrick Dermitte, waiter, aged 17 from France; *Wilfredo Lacap, porter, aged 36 from The Philippines; *Basdeobora Loakanodah, trainee manager, aged 23 from Mauritius; *John Lloyd, trainee manager, aged 22 from Sway, Hampshire, UK; *Edward Simpson, porter, aged 64 from the UK; *Ettore Vincon, waiter, aged 22 from Italy. Breathing apparatus used The breathing apparatus widely used at the incident was the Siebe Gorman Proto industrial oxygen rebreather. This was a one-hour closed circuit constant flow unit consisting of a breathing bag (containing a CO2 absorbent material) which hung in front of the wearer, oxygen cylinder (sat horizontally across the small of the back), mouthpiece, nose clip, and separate eyes-only goggles. It was successfully used for many years by the UK fire service, but could be hot in use and was complex to use and service. On near exhaustion of the oxygen supply, a whistle sounded to tell the wearer that he had only a few minutes supply left. At the time in the London Fire Brigade and other UK authorities, the wearing of BA was restricted to a number of trained and generally more senior fire-fighters. A number of open circuit compressed air breathing apparatus sets were also used, the Siebe Gorman Airmaster carried on some pumping appliances. These represent the type used in the UK fire service and others worldwide today. The set comprises a large cylinder charged with compressed air, linked to a demand valve combined into the face mask, secured with straps around the head. This type of BA set was simpler to use and service and rather than re-cycling the breathed air, discharged it directly to atmosphere, with a typical duration of 45 minutes. Aftermath A kitchen porter, Edward Mansfield, aged 41, was charged at the Old Bailey on 10 July 1975, with three cases of arson (one at the Worsley Hotel on 13 December and two at the Piccadilly Hotel on 19 and 29 December) and the murders of seven people, including a fireman, at the Worsley Hotel. He pleaded not guilty. On 23 July the jury failed to reach the required majority verdict and were discharged. The re-trial of Mansfield at the Old Bailey on the same charges began on 12 November 1975. John Mathew was again the prosecuting counsel. It ended on 1 December. Mansfield was found guilty of the manslaughter of seven people, including Fireman Pettit, and of three charges of arson. He was gaoled for life. The building was re-built after the fire as flats, and still stands today although the buildings are now known as \\"Connaught House\\". A blue plaque is attached to the wall of No 9, commemorating the connection with pioneer electrical engineer Ambrose Fleming. Having struck up a friendship with the Station Officer of Paddington Fire Station, TV Newsreader Gordon Honeycombe wrote an account of the fire, named Red Watch after one of the colour coded shift designators used in the UK Fire Service. The book, first published in 1976 centres on the local fire station at Paddington, giving an account of the days leading up to the fire. The reader follows the crews through their working routines, and the working practices and terminology are introduced. The fire is described in detail, based on the accounts of the fire brigade personnel who were present on the night. As one of the most informative accounts of work in the UK Fire Service at that time, it has remained in print.

They count 320 members, and the leader of their tribal association is Renato Caritiana. They subsist by farming, fishing and hunting, and have almost no contact with the outside world. Their tongue, the Kariti√¢na language, is an Arik√©m language of Brazil. Studies of population genetics often use the Karitiana as a reference population for Native Americans, using DNA samples made available through the Human Genome Diversity Project and other sources. DNA from Karitiana individuals was collected in 1987 by Francis Black and in 2007 it was reported that this sampling was undertaken unbeknownst to FUNAI, the Brazilian agency that regulates contact between the indigenous tribes and the outside world, and that the samples were being distributed for a fee with no benefit to the Karitiana, giving rise to claims of biopiracy. The same newspaper report claimed that further samples were taken in 1996 by Dr. Hilton Pereira da Silva, a doctor on a documentary film crew, on the promise of medicinal supplies that were never fulfilled. A response from Dr. Silva suggests that the news story was faulty and the medicinal samples he took were never used for any commercial purpose. Origins A 2015 genetic study reached a surprising conclusion about the origins of the Karitiana people. Unlike other Native American peoples, the Paiter-Surui, Karitiana, and Xavante have an ancestry partially related to indigenous Australasian populations of the Andaman Islands, New Guinea, and Australia. Scientists speculate that the relationship derives from an earlier people, called \\"Population Y\\", in East Asia from whence both groups diverged 15,000 to 30,000 years ago, the future Australasians migrating south and the remote ancestors of the Karitiana northward finding their way to the New World and to the interior Amazon Basin.

Yarnold was a diminutive lower-order right- handed batsman and a wicketkeeper who played for Worcestershire. He made his first-class debut in an end-of-season match in the 1938 season as the deputy for Syd Buller, who would later be an umpiring colleague. He was then Buller's replacement for two months of the 1939 season after Buller was seriously injured in the car crash that took the life of opening batsman Charlie Bull during the Whitsun match with Essex. Returning to Worcestershire after the Second World War, Yarnold again understudied Buller, who played in 25 of the county's 27 first-class matches. But Yarnold himself played in 17 games, mainly as a batsman. Early in the season, in the match against Sussex at Hove, he made 64 in the first innings, his first score of more than 50. There were, however, to be only six other scores of more than 50 in his entire career and his season's batting average for 1946, at 15.45 runs per innings, was higher than he achieved in any other season. The 64 was surpassed only once: in 1947, playing for North against South in the traditional end-of-season fixture, he made 68. Buller retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 1946 season, and the following year Yarnold stepped into his position as the regular Worcestershire wicketkeeper. He remained there for the next nine seasons until he himself retired at the end of the 1955 season. In his first season as regular wicketkeeper, he broke the Worcestershire record for the most dismissals in a season, with 85 (plus three more in the North v South match). Two years later, in 1949, he broke his own record and his 110 dismissals that season - 63 catches and 47 stumpings - put him third on the all-time list for the number of dismissals by a wicketkeeper in one season, exceeded only by Leslie Ames, who made 128 in 1929 and 122 in 1928. In the match against Hampshire at Worcester, he made nine dismissals in the match, and was awarded a bonus of ¬£100 by the county club. Many of the stumpings, and some catches, were made off the bowling of the unorthodox leg-spinner Roly Jenkins, who took 183 wickets in the season and was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. The 1949 tally of dismissals remains a county record: in 1951 Yarnold achieved what may be a first-class cricket record. Playing against Scotland in a first-class match at Dundee, he equalled the then record for most dismissals in a first-class innings with seven and set what was claimed as a new world record with six stumpings among them. After retiring from first-class cricket in 1955, he became an umpire from 1959 until his death in 1974. He umpired in three Test matches, one each against India and Pakistan in 1967 and one against Australia the following year. He died on the way home from umpiring in a rain-ruined three-day game between Northamptonshire and Essex at Wellingborough when his car crashed into a lorry.

Thorverton is a village in Devon, England, about a mile west of the River Exe and north of Exeter. It is almost centrally located between Exeter and the towns of Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton, and contains the hamlets of Yellowford and Raddon. It has two churches and two public houses. The population is approximately 900, reducing to 674 at the 2011 Census. The Millennium Green provides walking alongside the stream which runs through the centre of the village. The Memorial Hall provides a centre for entertainment, with a monthly Saturday Market for local produce. A monthly local village magazine, Focus on Thorverton, is produced by volunteers. Thorverton is a major part of the Cadbury electoral ward. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 1,602. History =Early history= The name of Thorverton may be Scandinavian in origin and the village might have been named after its founder. Old records mention the parish as Toruerton in 1182. In 1340 the parish was called Thorferton. Other sources believe that the name is an ancient reference to a thorn-bush besides a river crossing. There was briefly a small settlement here during Roman times, perched on a hill overlooking a fording point across the River Exe (near to the current day bridge), a key crossing for the military garrisoned at Exeter (Isca Dumnoniorum). There is no evidence however to suggest that there was a settlement here by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, although Thorverton Mill was running at this time on the River Exe (and continued to do so until its closure in 1979). (Raddon, a hamlet W of Thorverton is mentioned in the Domesday book. \\"William holds RADDON (in Thorverton) from the abbott. Wulfmaer held it in TRE, and it paid geld for 1 virgate of land. There is land for 2 ploughs. There is 1 villan with half a plough and 1 slave and of meadow and of pasture. It is worth 5s\\") The very centre of the village is The Bury, which is likely to be the oldest part of the village. After the Anglo-Saxon conquest, Thorverton became a military plantation. The Bury today still forms a wide rectangle - a stockade from the natives based in nearby Cadbury. It could house all the cattle until the crisis passed. Over time, the space became more commonly used for cattle trading. The earliest such indication of a market comes from a charter for a fair in 1250 for 'Thormerton'. =The Civil War= During the Civil War, Thorverton, as the location of a major crossing, was often on the front line. In 1644 the Parliamentarians under the Earl of Essex were besieging Royalist Exeter. Some of the Roundhead troops marched into Thorverton, destroyed a large stock of oats, damaged possessions of the Church and took money from the parson and Mr Tuckfield at Raddon Court. Parson Travers and Mr Tuckfield were known loyalists and were therefore targeted for rough treatment. The Roundheads moved off into Cornwall and subsequent defeat, leaving Thorverton in Royalist control with a military presence. A line against attack from the Midlands was formed between Eggesford and Cullompton, with Thorverton the bridgehead and the headquarters of General Goring along with several thousand troops. It was to Thorverton that the 15-year-old Prince of Wales (later Charles II) came out from the walled city of Exeter to review his troops. The force retreated in the face of Fairfax and his Roundheads however in October 1645. Fairfax and a seemingly endless line of Parliamentary infantrymen moved through Thorverton on the way to Newton St Cyres and Crediton. Across the bridge, up Silver Street, past the Dolphin and out past Bullen Head. Parliamentary troops were then stationed in Thorverton whilst Exeter was besieged for the second time and fell in April 1646. Following that all military activity left Thorverton in peace. =The Second World War= During the Second World War, Thorverton was used as a billet for American artillery troops prior to D-Day. 'A' Battery, 953rd Field Artillery Battalion lived within the village between November 1943 and Spring 1944. 'B' Battery stayed in Silverton. During this time they prepared for the D-Day invasion using firing ranges on Dartmoor. The 953rd set sail on D-Day + 3 and landed at the Normandy beaches on D-Day +5. They were heavily involved in repulsing the German counter-offensive at the Battle of the Bulge in winter 1944/45. A memorial plaque to the 953rd's stay in Thorverton can be found in the Millennium Green. The plaque was presented to the village in 2002 by a former officer of the 953rd (W.M.C Arthur of Jaffrey, New Hampshire) and dedicated to the memory of Suzanne Easterbrook, who died in that year, \\"and other fine people of Thorverton who were so welcoming to the young American soldiers\\". Geology Thorverton, located on clay and sand, has a subsoil of red rock, which gives the fertile earth its distinctive red colouring. The area is rich in rare and unusual rocks and minerals. Manganese has been found near Upton Pyne, and small quantities of gold in local streams. An igneous rock has been quarried at Raddon since the 12th century and the bubbled rock can be seen in numerous examples of local stonework. Agriculture, fairs and the community Agriculture was the main activity associated with the village, and there are many ancient farmhouses within the parish. Raddon Court was a Saxon estate. Upcott farm, Bidwell farm and Lynch farm have also been there for many years. Traymill, to the north of the parish on the Exe, was built about 1400 and has traceried windows, arched doorways and still retains the original hall roof. The fertile red soil produced excellent wheat, barley and apples, which were the main crops. An orchard covered the rear grounds (now gardens) behind the cottages on the south side of Bullen Street. A few apple trees remain. Thorverton was also once well known locally for its apricots. There were two main fairs held in the parish each year, which were customary holidays for the scholars at the National School. One took place on the last Monday in February, chiefly for \\"fat sheep\\", and the second on the Monday following 18 July for lambs - at which upwards of 40,000 were frequently sold for rearing. There was a monthly cattle fair and Thorverton was noted for its excellent breed of sheep. The fairs have since ceased, but in their place the village still enjoys annual festivities during the summer with Church Week and the Country Show. Thorverton was once a thriving, self-sufficient community. In 1850, there were four bakers, three blacksmiths in the cottages along Bullen Street. One of the blacksmiths also covered any dentistry requirements. There were three butchers, one of which was located at the prominent stilted building in the centre of the village next to the green, built in 1763 in the local style of the time. Four grocers, two saddlers, two shoemakers, four tailors - one of which lived in Dinneford Street - two wheelwrights (a prosperous waggon-works in Jericho Street), and two plumbers. Also a builder, corn miller, apple nurseryman and a maltster. In addition to these trades, Thorverton had a parson and a curate, a surgeon, a solicitor, an accountant, an auctioneer, and a veterinary surgeon. For rural services there was a builder, a corn-miller, an apple-nurseryman, an agricultural machine-maker, a maltster, and a druggist. The Bury was lined with shops, now almost all converted to private homes, the broad windows of which still speak of a prosperous recent past. The last shop - known as 'The Dairy' closed in 2006. For ten years, the needs of the village were served by a second hand mobile ex-library vehicle situated in the car park which was driven up and down the road outside the Thorverton Arms until a permanent place at the village car park was agreed. In 2016 Berry Dairy General Stores was re-established in the original Dairy in the centre of the village, which now thrives by offering high quality local produce. The business of the Post Office is conducted from a portable cabin within the village car park. The original Post Office, now a private home in the centre of the village on the corner of Bullen Street and School Lane, was run by three generations of the Cummings family from 1870 to 1994, commemorated today by a blue plaque. The car park itself was created on the site of a former quarry. A channelled stream, which drains the Raddon (literally 'red hill') Hills to the north and runs to the River Exe, winds through the village, characteristic of several East Devon villages. A pedestrian bridge and ford cross the stream at Silver Street. The village green at the bottom of Jericho Street once hosted a large fir tree - planted by 10-year-old Mary Norrish of Raddon Court Barton at the time of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887. Its lop-sidedness is prominent in many of the old photographs of Thorverton. The tree eventually became too big and was taken down in 1947 for the price of the wood contained within it. Every December a Christmas tree, decorated with lights, is placed on the same spot as the old Jubilee tree. Cobbled streets have been preserved throughout the centre of the village, as has an elaborate system of watercourses established in the 1850s; the idea of the Rector's daughter following a serious outbreak of cholera. Bridges The current Thorverton bridge. Thorverton's population was once much larger as the village rested near the primary means for crossing the River Exe on the main road from London towards Cornwall. It remained so until the mid-18th century. Further to this, the bridge stands on the site of an ancient fordable crossing point and accounts for the main reason the village came into existence. The bridge currently spanning the River Exe is a modern concrete construction, but it is the successor to several earlier bridges. The first bridge, constructed of timber, was placed here in 1307. The timber bridge was replaced with a stone one in 1415 thanks to a donation of ¬£10 by Thomas Barton of Exeter. The quarry at the site of the Council Car Park was used in 1811 to provide stone for the new Thorverton bridge, to be built by county surveyor, James Green. The bridge was completed within two years, but Green complained that he had lost ¬£1200 in building it because of issues with the quarry. Quarry owner, John Niner of the Barliabins estate, received payment for the stone as well as compensation for the damage done to his land. Green's bridge lasted until 1912, when the current bridge was constructed to take heavier traffic. A 32-metre weir was constructed across the river here in 1973 due to the unstable condition of the riverbed. A monitoring station was put in place here by the Rivers Authority in 1956 for the purpose of flood warning monitoring in advance of Exeter. The Environment Agency has since installed web cameras here which can be viewed by the public online. Public houses Because of the centuries of national as well as local traffic crossing the bridge, there were once no less than five coaching inns in the village, two of which remain today. The Exeter and the Thorverton Arms are still open today but the Bell Inn ceased trading in 2010, having planning permission granted to turn it into residential dwellings. The Thorverton Arms in the centre of the village, for the majority of its life known as 'The Dolphin', was built in the 16th century. Amusing, if lurid, tales of its past provide a glimpse of the human life of Thorverton's past. A traveller turned up at The Dolphin one evening in 1650 and took a room for himself and his sister. The landlord, after a while, had reason to suspect their relationship and confronted them. The traveller blandly replied that as Adam and Eve were the father and mother of us all, the lady could truthfully be described as his 'sister'. The Bell Inn, Thorverton. The Exeter Inn on Bullen Street and the Bell Inn on Dinneford Street were built in the early 19th-century. The Exeter Inn was built as 'The Wellington' (honouring the recent victory in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo), but was known locally as 'West's House' after the owner Mr Walter Western. It was renamed 'The Exeter' on 17 December 1861 when the pub became a station for parcels to the city. The hanging sign on the front elevation denotes the City of Exeter's Coat of Arms. The pub was purchased on 1 February 1897 for the sum of ¬£950 by Wm Hancock & Sons (Wiveliscombe) Ltd. It has been independently owned by the Mann family since just after the Second World War. It contains a 28-foot deep well in the centre of the bar built from local stone and fed from local springs maintaining a level of 4 ‚Äì 5 feet. More recently the well has been known to have been used for the cool storage of beers. The Exeter Inn sports an impressive collection of antique firearms on its walls; a collection started by Jack Mann and continued by the current landlord. The Bell Inn was rebuilt entirely after fire destroyed its earlier incarnation but has now closed for business. Its name is derived from its position opposite Thorverton Church. Of the 'lost' inns, the 'Royal Oak' was situated at the junction of Bullen Street and The Bury, where Berry House now stands. The name was applied after the Restoration of Charles II to commemorate his flight during the Civil War. It is likely that its name prior to that was The Cornish Chough. The fifth inn in the village was located east of the Thorverton Arms at Acorn House (now a private residence). The hatch to the beer cellar is still visible. In addition to these, there are also hints of a Stag Inn in the 18th century and a Ship Inn in the 19th century, both within The Bury. Sports The village is home to Thorverton Cricket Club, founded in 1860. The club has over 100 members, both senior and junior. It fields three sides in the Devon Cricket League as well as various other competitions. The 1st XI play their matches in the third tier of the DCL, the 'B' Division. The cricket club has a thriving youth policy, which produced first-class cricketer Giles White. Thorverton Football Club field two teams in the Devon and Exeter Football League. Schools Berry House, which now stands where the Royal Oak used to, was the home of Thomas Broom Row and before 1860 was known as Pugh's House. Mr Row was the village Vestry Clerk, accountant, insurance agent who went bankrupt in 1860. The house was subsequently converted by his wife and daughters to a Ladies Seminary, and the house was renamed Berry House in keeping with the Berry School at Silverton. There was a substantial yeoman called Mr John Berry, who in the mid-17th century held five farms and 22 houses and cottages in the village, which he leased from the Dean and Chapter of Exeter and sub-let as an investment. Of his considerable fortune, he paid for the Berry's Bridge to be built, and provided a gift of ¬£60 in 1618 'to be lent to poor tradesmen', thus started a long tradition of charitable commissions within the village to support poor labouring men and widows, or bread and money to be distributed at Easter. In 1673, Thomas Adams left ¬£100, half to be spent 'teaching poor children' and the other half to be used to distribute bread. Donations to education were a constant theme. In 1710, Margaret Tuckfield donated ¬£30 towards providing 'Bibles and coats for poor children'. So the village school slowly came into existence from 1673 and grew. But by 1815 there had been no further endowments since 1743, and it had become inadequate following the rise in the village population. A petition was therefore made to the court of chancery. It appealed that of the 140 poor children in the parish, only a small number could receive education. A National School was therefore built in Thorverton in 1845 by the Rev. James Duke Coleridge, to educate 130 children. Average attendance at the school in 1893 was about 112 pupils and the school-master was John Ashton Martin. The education of children in the parish was partly supported by a small endowment from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners who were Lords of the Manor. Thorverton also added an infants school and a boarding school around the same time. Thorverton still has a thriving primary school located in the appropriately named School Lane. There are approximately 80 pupils. Churches The Dean and Chapter of the cathedral in Exeter had been the lords of the manor since the days of Edward I. The Church continues to hold significant tracts of property within the village to this day. As such the village never had a squire. The Gothic church of St Thomas a Becket was built from locally quarried stone in the late 15th early 16th centuries, although parts of it may date back to the 13th century. The western tower contains a clock and 10 bells, which date respectively from 1861, 1674, 1673 (4 and 6) the fifth from 1662 and the tenor was added in the late 1990s. The church was successfully restored in 1834 when the nave was rebuilt. In recent times a portion of the east end of the church has been converted into a Lady Chapel and as if to balance this, a vicars chapel occupies the space beside the organ. The north transept was also enclosed and is now used for meetings and other occasions. There are also slate floor slabs to the Tuckfields of East Raddon, a hamlet one mile west of the village, where the abandoned workings of a stone quarry are still visible. There is also a Baptist church on Berrysbridge Road built in 1832 by the Baptists that lived in Thorverton, with John Hockin preaching the first sermons. They began with steep standards. In 1833, Mary Squire had her membership revoked due to her 'improper walk and conduct'. Another, Mrs Harris, for 'unchristian spirit' in 1837. A Roman Catholic Chapel was located in the hamlet of Raddon, but by 1850 this had become part of a farmhouse called Chapel St. Martin. The ancient chapel of St. John the Baptist was moved from an isolated site near Thorverton and re- erected as the cemetery chapel in 1925 to Crediton cemetery. Damage caused by fires Individual fires throughout the 19th century altered the face of Thorverton. With so many thatched cottages and the only means of light and heat being fire, it was perhaps inevitable. Just opposite the ford, six dwellings and their outhouses were consumed in 1770, but an insurance policy with the Sun Fire Office allowed a new settlement to be built. In 1812 a destructive fire broke out at Raddon Court farm. The premises were very spacious, consisting of two dwelling-houses, large stables, barns, linhays, cider-cellars, and many outbuildings. The farm was insured in the Royal Exchange Fire-Office, but not to the full amount.Some Selected Reports from the Salisbury and Winchester Journal http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dutillieul/ZOtherPapers/S&WJSep281812.html; In 1816, seventeen cottages on Jericho Street burned down as a result of a boy, a candle, and some straw. The Dolphin was almost completely destroyed in 1849, despite the efforts of early fire-engines from Silverton. Much of the building today dates from the rebuilding. It was the turn of the Exeter Inn in 1855. Next to the Thorverton Arms today is Leigh Gardens, developed in 1970 over the ruins of the cob and thatch Leigh House from where the saddler and the mason worked. A fire tore across the thatched roofs of Jericho Street in 1890. Four cottages were ablaze within minutes. William Cummings (postmaster named on the blue plaque) acted quickly to summon an engine from Exeter. They used water from the nearby stream. The labourers and artisans that inhabited the houses threw their furniture into the street in desperation, but uninsured they faced destitution. The plentiful supply of water allowed the fire to be extinguished before it reached the stack of timber stored at the Waggon Works. The cottages lining The Bury, Dinneford Street and the top end of Bullen Street were almost completely cob until the spate of fires in the 19th century. Where the tall brick buildings of Ferndale and Fairfield are now, there was until the late 1880s old cob cottages known as Elyots. The then cobbed Bell Inn caught fire in June 1904 when a fire burned the pub, the bakery next door and the house next to that to the ground. The pub was rebuilt, but the location of the other two buildings remain empty. Recent excavation work on the garden of the modern Bell Inn revealed a layer of charred earth from the fire. Railway station There was once a railway station at Thorverton on the Exe Valley Railway, part of the Great Western Railway completed in May 1885. The station was located at the far end of Silver Street. The wooden signpost at the road junction still notates the location as 'Station'. Following the removal of the railway line in October 1963 as part of the Beeching Axe. A short spur to Thorverton Mill remained for a few years longer. The old station was converted into a private home knowingly named \\"Beeching's Way\\". The line crossed Silver Street on a bridge, now removed, although the bridge abutments have been removed the embankments are clearly visible on either side of the road. Street names Street names had not taken a firm hold in Thorverton until the second half of the 18th century. Bullen Street was named from Bullen's Orchard, which was located where Bullens Close now stands. It is most likely that the orchard was owned by a gentleman of, or approximating, that name. Silver Street is simply a shortening of Silverton Street. Milfords Lane, which takes a dog-legged route through the ford received its name from the well-known local family of Milfords which have played an integral part in the history of the village. The Bury comes from the Saxon word burgh for fortified enclosure. Dinneford means hidden ford and refers to the stream that crosses the road here, now bridged. Dark Lane, which links Dinneford Street with Bullen Street at Crossways was so known in the village before parish registers included addresses in 1840. School Lane was previously known as Vicarage Lane, the vicarage being along this street still to this day. Nothing more than a nameplate put in place by the District Council introduced this change. There used to be houses running from the church to Dark Lane, before the churchyard was extended, that are no longer there. The path that ran alongside them was known as Castle Hill. Cleaves Close, built in 1952, was built on a field in the Cleaves estate named originally after Henry Clyve of 1569. Contemporaries of Henry Clyve included a Mr Barlebyn and Mr Retcliffe - other names lent to properties within Thorverton. Bullens Orchard, on which Bullens Close was built in the 1970s, was also part of the Cleaves estate. Broadlands has no historic significance to the estate built on what was Burt's and Milford's estates. The Glebe was developed (in 1979) on the grounds of the former vicarage, hence the name (see glebe).

The two sets of lyrics share little but the common refrain of \\"I won't dance\\". The second set of lyrics is the much better known one, and the song in this form has been covered by many artists. Kern, Hammerstein and Harbach originally wrote \\"I Won't Dance\\" for the 1934 London musical Three Sisters. However, Three Sisters flopped and was quickly forgotten. The next year, Fields was hired to help with the music for a film version of the 1933 Kern-Harbach musical Roberta. The writing team decided to make use of \\"I Won't Dance\\" for the film, also named Roberta. However, Fields rewrote nearly all of the lyrics, making the song more playful and suggestive by having the narrator refuse to dance because \\"I know that music leads the way to romance\\". The song became such a hit, largely due to the fact that it was performed by Fred Astaire, that it is now included in all stage revivals and recordings of Roberta.

The song is anachronistically used as a musical number performed by Felicia Day in the television film biography of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Warm Springs, which largely takes place in the year 1924. The song was also performed by Lucille Bremer and Van Johnson for the 1946 Kern biopic Till the Clouds Roll By. Since the scene takes place in a 1920s nightclub, its appearance in the chronology of the film is, again, anachronistic. The song was sung and danced to by Marge Champion and Gower Champion in the 1952 film \\"Lovely to Look At\\". The version of the song by Frank Sinatra was in a scene in the movie What Women Want, where the character Nick, played by Mel Gibson, is dancing with a coat hanger.

There they are commonly known as the Chigwell Sisters. In collaboration with their associates, auxiliaries, co-workers and volunteers, the Sisters work with the poor of the world, both to identify and transform underlying causes of suffering and to meet their practical needs.  Origins  The congregation has its origin in the French religious institute of the Sisters Servants of the Sacred Heart, founded by the Abb√© Peter-Victor Braun in Paris in 1866. In the course of his ministry, Braun served in a seedy quarter of the city where he became aware of the struggle of the young women there who had come as unskilled workers, especially when they were not able to find work in the factories. With the help of a small group of volunteers he opened a hostel where the young women could find a refuge and place of support. He also opened a day care center so that mothers could be free to find employment to support their families. Additionally home visits were done by his volunteer ladies to the residences of the sick poor to care for them in their need.\\"Our History\\", Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary By October 1866, Braun had reluctantly concluded that the work had to be entrusted to a congregation of professed Religious Sisters in order to guarantee its continuity. Thus he established three of these volunteers as a religious congregation, the Sisters Servants of the Sacred Heart, under the leadership of a Bavarian woman, Sister Anna Katharina Berger, who had come to Paris already a member of a community of Franciscan Sisters founded by the Blessed Paul Joseph Nardini in Pirmasens. She was appointed by Braun as Mother Superior of the small community under the name Mother Mary Odilia. Revolution and exile The sudden outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 caused a major change in the future of the small congregation. Rumors of anti-Catholic atrocities by the Paris Commune caused a group of the Sisters to flee to England for safety. They were followed by a larger group, who brought with them Braun, who was suffering from shock due to having ministered at the battlefront. Because of her nationality, the co- founder, Mother Odilia, was forced to return to her native Germany. The German and Austrian sisters were expelled from France and formed their own Congregation, Dienerinnen des heiligsten Herzens Jesu based in Vienna, Austria.\\"Sacred Heart sisters mark 150th anniversary at Clare Priory\\", Diocese of East Anglia, March 21, 2016 The refugees were warmly received by Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, the Archbishop of Westminster, who gave them a small house in the Stratford area of the city. The Sisters quickly established themselves in the East End of London where they began again their mission of helping struggling workers and their families. Their numbers in England grew, and the Sisters began to serve in Scotland and Wales, where they provided medical care in mining towns. They also opened schools where they taught the local children. They began the tradition of the entire community going out on weekends to visit the Catholic homes of the area. Separation After the upheavals of the Franco-Prussian War, and the subsequent uprisings, with the establishment of peace in France by the late 1870s, some of the French Sisters returned to their homeland. They re-established the congregation there and its work. After a generation, however, differences in vision began to emerge between the English and French Sisters. Under the advice of Cardinal Herbert Vaughan, in 1902 the majority of Sisters in England elected to separate from the Sister Servants of the Sacred Heart and to form a new congregation. They took the name the congregation now bears at its formal establishment on 3 March 1903. The Motherhouse of the new congregation was established in the London suburb of Chigwell, from which the Sisters are popularly known in England.\\"Chigwell Convent, Chigwell, Essex\\", Parish News, St. Thomas of Canterbury, Woodford Green Sister Winifride Tyrrell, born near Monasterevin in Ireland, who had served for many years as a principal in the Mile End neighborhood of London, was elected as the first Superior General. Expansion Under the guidance of Mother Winifride the early Sisters served the poor in industrial cities, towns and villages throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Their first Irish foundation was made in Cork in 1922, followed by Cardiff in Wales. In the mid-1950s the congregation was established in the United States, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland and in Zambia. At the start of the 21st century, the Sisters started to serve war-ravaged populations in Colombia and El Salvador. In 2001 they embarked on providing computer literacy to the street children of Cebu in the Philippines.\\", Claretians Communications Foundation, Inc. Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary\\" The following year they began caring for AIDS patients in Kampala, Uganda. In 2003 the three congregations stemming from Braun's work formed the Victor Braun Federation. Made up of the three congregations which trace their roots to Braun's original group, the members are: the S≈ìurs Servantes du Sacr√©-C≈ìur de J√©sus, Dienerinnen des heiligsten Herzens Jesu in Austria, and the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Projects are developed to meet local needs. In general terms these are aimed at the education and welfare of children and training and health education for adults. The Sisters also operated a \\"mother and baby home\\" in Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland from 1930 to 1970. Life at the home features in the 2009 book The Lost Child of Philomena LeeThe Lost Child of Philomena Lee: A Mother, Her Son and a Fifty Year Search, Martin Sixsmith. by Martin Sixsmith, and in Philomena, the 2013 film that is based on it. During that period, mothers and children were often forcibly separated, with some children being removed for adoption in the US in exchange of donations to the home. In 1939 the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts took over the Priory of St. Augustine, in Old Colwyn, Wales‚Äîoriginally built as a hotel‚Äîfrom a community of Augustinian nuns.

The document specifically states that it is aimed at bishops, priests, religious and other pastoral workers in hopes of pastoral caregivers paying greater attention to expressions of human mobility. The document derived some of its material from the Old Testament, the New Testament, the American Automobile Association, and statements by Popes Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul II. On its issue this document received a lot of media attention due to its listing of Ten Commandments for Drivers. In essence, the Vatican is pointing out that the act of driving has a moral and ethical component. The Guidelines make note of both the benefits of the use of automobiles as well as its dangerous and negative consequences. The problem is not as pervasive in the Vatican City itself, which has a speed limit of 30 km/h (18-19 mph) and approximately only 1000 cars; but there were over 35 million deaths resulting from car accidents in the 20th century, and the Vatican is responding. In the same section of the document as the Drivers' Ten Commandments are the so- called Christian virtues of drivers, which include prudence, justice and hope. The Guidelines not only deal with problems on the road, but also address prostitution, caring for street children and the homeless, found in Parts Two, Three and Four of the Guidelines. The Guidelines state that driving can bring out primitive behavior in drivers, which leads to road rage, rude gestures, speeding, drinking behind the wheel, cursing, blasphemy, impoliteness, and intentional violation of the highway code. The Guidelines encourage drivers to obey the highway code, pray behind the wheel and recite the rosary, which the Guidelines insist would not distract the driver's attention.

However, the president, Franjo Tuƒëman did not allow him to proceed with his duties as mayor, leading to the Zagreb Crisis: Zagreb's local government would go on to place four other mayors from the party, each of which was blocked by Tuƒëman. As a member of the HSLS party, which was allied with SDP during the 2000 parliament elections, Graniƒá entered the newly formed government as Ivica Raƒçan's deputy prime minister.

G. Wells. The story was featured in three parts between May and August 1897 in The Idler magazine, and was later released in collected editions. The story is set during the Stone Age, and tells of a caveman named Ugh-lomi, who bonds with the young woman Eudena and kills his rival, the de facto tribal leader Uya. Whilst in exile, Ugh-lomi becomes the first man to ride a horse, and to combine stone and wood to fashion an axe. He uses this weapon, along with his wits, to survive encounters with cave bears, hyenas and rhinos, and ultimately claim the position of tribal leader for himself.

History The idea of constructing a hotel in Tigre (then named \\"Las Conchas\\") came from a group of rowing enthusiasts who met at the \\"Pulper√≠a del Portugu√©s\\" of Buenos Aires in February 1870. Besides, several rowing clubs (such as Buenos Aires R.C.) would then establish their headquarters in the area. After searching for a vacant land, they finally found one located near the confluences of Reconquista and Luj√°n. The hotel was designed by the engineer Emilio Mitre (son of the Argentine president Bartolom√© Mitre) and financed by Mitre himself with Ernesto Tornquist and Luis Garc√≠a. Works began in 1873 and the hotel was finally inaugurated on February 12, 1890. It soon became an important social, tourist and sporting centre, not only for the people of Tigre, but also for porte√±os. The hotel had 3 floors, an elevator and 50 rooms (all of them heated) with a ground floor dining room seating 200 people. There were salons for smoking, billiards, and for ladies. The hotel had a coffeehouse, tennis courts, a cricket pitch, an area for roller skating, and there was a garage for cars. In November 1892 the proprietors requested the Municipality of Tigre permission to organise regattas on Sunday and holidays. Three years later the hotel was authorised to open a casino. By those times, services also included evenings with fireworks, a permanent orchestra and other attractions on the banks of Luj√°n River. An Andalusian Patio and a winter garden were constructed afterwards. At the end of the 19th century, Ludovico Schafer and E.E. Fischer acquired Tigre Hotel. The house was re-opened in 1895 with an inaugural big lunch. Some of the changes made by the new owners included the suppression of the roulette room.Historia del Tigre Hotel In 1916 various repairs and improvements were made to the building at the height of the Belle √âpoque as the hotel became the place where the elite of society of the time met and stayed and was famous for its dancing parties. The economic crisis in the 1930s took its toll and in February 1939 the hotel closed its doors definitely. One year later the building was destroyed by fire and subsequently demolished.Viaje al 1900 en el Museo de Tigre, Clar√≠n, 10 Mar 2014 The place where the Tigre Hotel had stood remained abandoned, until the Tigre City Council building was constructed there, next to Tigre Club (nowadays the Tigre Art Museum). In popular culture Today there is sometimes a confusion between the Tigre Hotel and the Tigre Club that was built next to the Hotel in 1912 and is still standing. Following its 1979 designation as a National Historic Monument, a decade of refurbishments ensued. The Tigre Art Museum was opened in 2006.EL EDIFICIO Y SU HISTORIA on Museo de Arte de Tigre (MAT) website  Bibliography  * Graciela Clemente, Tigre y Delta, Grijalbo Mondadori, Buenos Aires, 2004.

He is author of several philosophical texts wrongly attributed by earlier scholars to the benedictinian monk Brun Candidus of Fulda, the author of the vita of Abott Eigil of Fulda. But recent research into the manuscript tradition furnishing clear evidence attested the authorship of Candidus Wizo, the learned disciple of Alcuin. But see also Celia Chazelle, The Crucified God in the Carolingian Era. Theology and Art of Christ‚Äôs Passion, Cambridge u.a. 2001, pp. 160-164 with note 96; p. 191 with note 106, who defends the traditional opinion by some new arguments. Based on his deep knowledge of the works of Saint Augustine of Hippo he tried to give proof of god‚Äôs existence, to demonstrate that the incorporeal nature of god is conceivable only by means of the spiritual eye and excludes any possibility of viewing him by means of the corporeal eyes, and to elucidate the problem of the incarnation explaining its need by the weakness of the human cognition. At the palace school he was tutor to Gisla, the sister, and Rodtruda, the daughter of Charlemagne. When Alcuin went to Tours (796), Candidus was his successor as master of the palace school. Alcuin's esteem for Candidus is shown by his dedicating his commentary on Ecclesiastes to his friends Onias, Fredegisus, and Candidus.

Iluka is the largest producer of zircon and titanium dioxide-derived rutile and synthetic rutile globally. Iluka mines heavy mineral sands and separates the concentrate into its individual mineral constituents rutile, ilmenite, and zircon. Some of the ilmenite is then processed into synthetic rutile. Iluka has operations in the Australian states of Western Australia (Eucla and Perth Basins), South Australia (Jacinth-Ambrosia Mine), Victoria and New South Wales (Murray Basin), the United States (Virginia) and Sierra Leone.  History  Iluka Resources was formed in July 1998 in a merger between Westralian Sands and the titanium mineral business of RGC (Renison Goldfields Consolidated). Westralian Sands was established in 1954 but commenced operations in 1959 when it started mining and processing the Yoganup deposit near Capel in Western Australia. By 1999, the company (now Iluka Resources) sold off or closed many parts of its business including Westlime Limited, Koba Tin, RGC Thalanga Copper, RGC South Capel operation and its share of the Narama Coal mine in New South Wales. In September 2008 the company signing a multi-million deal with rail freight operator El Zorro to carry containerised mineral sands from Portland in the south-west of Victoria to Melbourne, with Iluka saying rail transport was cheaper than road. David Robb was appointed Managing Director and CEO of Iluka Resources Limited on 18 October 2006. Company profits were $61.7 million in 2008, almost three times the size of the forecast amount, this was a result of higher Zircon prices and a devaluation of the Australian dollar. In March 2009, Iluka announced that it would bring forward the closure of one of the Synthetic Rutile kilns at the Narngulu operations and that 23 jobs would be lost. The move came in response to falling demand as a result of the Global Economic Crisis. As a result of demand from China, the 2011 net year profit increased fifteen times the 2010 result. The 2011 profit was reported as $542 million, compared to $36 million in 2010. The companies profit was driven by higher production with 158,000 tonnes of mineral sands. On 18 December 2013, Greg Martin was appointed Chairman of Iluka Resources. Greg Martin has previous had over 30 years‚Äô experience in the energy, utility and infrastructure sectors, having spent 25 years with AGL Energy, including five years as CEO and managing director. Greg Martin is currently Chairman of Prostar Investments (Australia) Pty Ltd, and a non-executive Director of Santos, Energy Developments Limited and the industry-funded Australian Energy Market Operator. Iluka established an initial 18.3 per cent interest in the UK technology company, Metalysis, which is seeking to commercialise technology to convert metals into powder, including titanium powder. Iluka increased its interest to approximately 28 percent in 2016 with additional investment. Iluka also commenced work in 2014 with Vale S.A in relation to the potential commercialisation of a large titanium ore body, with rare earth elements, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Iluka conducts international exploration, including for selected non-mineral sands opportunities, mainly on its Australian tenements. The 2015 full-year profit was $53.5 million which was up from a $62.5 million loss in the previous corresponding period. The mineral sands sales increased 1.9% to $950.8 million up from $932.8 million in the previous year. The dividen was 19c a share (full franked) and increased the annual payout to 25c a share. Tom O'Leary was appointed chief executive officer of Iluka Resources Limited on 5 September 2016. He was previously managing director of Wesfarmers Chemicals, Energy and Fertilisers division, having been appointed to the role in 2010. Mr O'Leary joined Wesfarmers in 2000 in a Business Development role and was then appointed to managing director, Wesfarmers Energy in 2009. Prior to joining Wesfarmers, Tom O'Leary worked in London for 10 years in finance law, investment banking and private equity. Tom O'Leary holds a law degree from the University of Western Australia and has attended the six-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.

In August 2016, Iluka announced its intention to acquire Sierra Leone-based and London Stock Exchange-listed miner Sierra Rutile Limited. The sale was finalised in December 2016 for A$393 million. As part of the acquisition, Iluka intends to invest A$290 million to expand production, improve operation and safety facilities and streamline operations.

His highest rank was komusubi, which he held on ten occasions. He won the top makuuchi division tournament championship or yusho in 1964 and was runner-up in two other tournaments. He won seven special prizes and seven gold stars for defeating yokozuna. After his retirement in 1968 he was an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and was the head coach of Takasago stable from 1988 until shortly before his retirement from the Sumo Association in 2002. He died of liver disease in 2003. Career Making his debut in 1953, he wrestled for Takasago stable, home of then yokozuna Azumafuji to whom the \\"Fuji\\" part of his shikona referred. He first entered the top makuuchi division in 1959 and was runner-up in two tournaments that year, winning a special prize for Fighting Spirit in each. His highest rank was komusubi, which he first reached in 1960. He spent a total of ten tournaments at that rank, the last coming in 1967, but never managed to earn promotion to sekiwake. He never managed to win more than eight bouts as a komusubi but was somewhat unlucky not be promoted after two consecutive 8‚Äì7 records at the rank in 1961, and he was regarded as certainly being of sekiwake level in ability. He holds the modern record for most tournaments at komusubi without reaching sekiwake. The highlight of his career came in July 1964 when he took the top division championship or y≈´sh≈ç with a 14‚Äì1 record. He was ranked as a maegashira at the time and did not meet any ≈çzeki or yokozuna during the tournament. He defeated sekiwake Kitanofuji on the final day, avoiding the need for a playoff with ≈çzeki Yutakayama. He was perhaps fortunate that yokozuna Taih≈ç, who won four championships in that year alone, dropped out after five days. His tsukebito or personal attendant was Hawaiian born Takamiyama, later to become the first foreigner to win a championship, and Fujinishiki was one of the wrestlers who helped introduce him to sumo and Japanese culture. His mentorship of Takamiyama continued as a coach after his retirement from the ring. Retirement from sumo Following his retirement as an active wrestler in November 1968 he stayed at Takasago stable as a coach under the elder name of Nishiiwa. In 1988 he became head of the stable, following the death of former yokozuna Asashio Tar≈ç III. He coached Konishiki, Mitoizumi and amongst others. He also served on the Japan Sumo Association's board of directors. However, after his wrestler Toki was involved in a car accident that killed a pedestrian in December 2000, he was punished by a demotion and a reduction in salary. In February 2002, in failing health, he passed on ownership of the stable to former ≈çzeki Asashio Tar≈ç IV, who merged his Wakamatsu stable with Takasago's. He let his former wrestler Mitoizumi use the old Takasago premises to launch Nishikido stable. He remained as a coach under the Wakamatsu name until his retirement the following month upon reaching 65, and continued to attend training sessions after that. He died of liver disease in December 2003. Fighting style He specialized in pushing and thrusting techniques (tsuki/oshi) and was known for his strong tachi-ai or initial charge. Personal life His eldest son , born in 1969, is a professional wrestler. His second eldest son Akihiro was once the personal manager of yokozuna Asashoryu (who was criticized for failing to attend Fujinishiki's funeral). It was Akihiro who was initially reported to have been punched by Asashoryu in a drunken brawl at a dance club in January 2010, although it soon emerged it was the manager of the club and this led to the yokozuna's enforced retirement. He was seen in the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice, fighting in a bout against Kotozakura. Career record *The Kyushu tournament was first held in 1957, and the Nagoya tournament in 1958.

In humans, centromere protein B is encoded by the CENPB gene.  Function  Centromere protein B is a highly conserved protein that facilitates centromere formation. It is a DNA-binding protein that is derived from transposases of the pogo DNA transposon family. It contains a helix-loop-helix DNA binding motif at the N-terminus and a dimerization domain at the C-terminus. The DNA binding domain recognizes and binds a 17-bp sequence (CENP-B box) in the centromeric alpha satellite DNA. This protein is proposed to play an important role in the assembly of specific centromere structures in interphase nuclei and on mitotic chromosomes.

It began operations in Stonington in 1957, and was later purchased by the Monsanto Chemical Company. It specialized in the manufacturing of plastic bottles. The General Manager was Benedict U. Feole, formerly of New Britain, Connecticut and Westerly, Rhode Island. History The building that housed 'Plax' has gone through many incarnations. It was built by John F. Trumbull in 1851. It was then leased and used to make horseshoe nails and, later, trinkets from the South Sea trade. It eventually housed the Josly Fire Arms Company and made 16,500 breech-loading carbines, used mainly by the Union cavalry during the Civil War. It was closed soon after the war and subsequently had several short term tenants. In 1876, the Atwood Machine Company took occupancy. The building was leased by 'Plax', although the dates of occupancy are unclear. 'Plax' was purchased by the Monsanto Company and eventually moved its operations from Stonington, Connecticut to St. Louis, Missouri. In the Hartford Courant, on November 11, 1963, an article was published stating that \\"...Monsanto Chemical Company Friday admitted a Connecticut division of its giant production operation -- the Plax Company at Stonington -- may undergo some changes.\\" There is a picture of 'Plax' when it was owned by The Monsanto Company, dated 1957. It can be found in the University Archives, Special Collections, of The Washington University Library in St. Louis, Missouri. This archive houses documents and pictures owned by Monsanto from 1901 to 2006. (See the second outside link, below.) This historic building was consumed by a fire on July 3, 2003, although the walls still remain standing. While the foregoing describes the manufacturing end of Plax, there was more to it than that. A Research & Development group was based in Bloomfield, Connecticut. The group developed plastics blow-molding equipment which it installed in its own manufacturing facilities and also licensed to other companies on an international basis. In the basement of the Bloomfield building it tested the machinery that it developed. The company held several patents for this type of machinery, which are listed below.

It was held on 19 July 2007. The election was triggered when Piara Khabra, the Labour Party Member of Parliament for Ealing Southall, died on 19 June 2007. Khabra had held the constituency since the 1992 election, while the Labour party has held the seat since its creation in the 1983 election, and the predecessor seat of Southall since it was created before the 1945 election. The government moved the writ for the by-election in Parliament on 28 June 2007, the day after the funeral of Piara Khabra. This by-election and the Sedgefield by-election, also being held on 19 July, were significant because they were the first elections to take place during the tenure of the new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. According to the Elections Office of Ealing Council, the electorate was 85,423 which represented an increase of 1,685 (2%) on the 2005 general election.

Released on August 7, 2007, it was their first studio effort since 2003's Natural Selection and was the last Fuel album to feature original songwriter/guitarist Carl Bell and bassist Jeff Abercrombie. No musician on this album is still with the band. It was also Fuel's only studio album to feature new vocalist Toryn Green, and their final album for Epic Records. With a new singer, the album also introduced a new Fuel logo. Former Godsmack drummer Tommy Stewart was announced as the band's new drummer but was unable to perform on the album due to other commitments so Josh Freese and Tommy Lee performed drums in his place.Matera, Joe.

Alternative Addiction. July 21, 2007. After Scallions' departure from the group was announced, rumors began to rise that American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry might be in line to replace Scallions as Fuel's frontman. Daughtry had performed a version of the band's 2000 Top 40 hit, \\"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\\" in one of his performances on the show and Bell has stated that several conversations occurred between Daughtry and the band reflecting the possibility of him joining the group, \\"[Daughtry] was saying ‚ÄòHey if I don‚Äôt make this American Idol thing, maybe there is something that both of us can work out.'\\" Ultimately Daughtry would decline the opportunity to join the band, so Bell and bassist Jeff Abercrombie continued their search for a possible replacement for Scallions. Bell and Abercrombie felt there was a paucity of singers in the Los Angeles area, so they wound up allowing potential singers to send in their auditions through the internet. After going through a large number of audition tapes that were sent in and auditioning other singers, Bell and Abercrombie chose Toryn Green as the band's new frontman. Green was chosen as he had the image, preparation, and knew the lyrics to the songs he was singing during the audition.Chad. \\"Fuel Names New Lead Singer\\" . Alternative Addiction. April 20, 2007. Writing, recording, and production Bell spent more than two years writing material for Angels & Devils, drawing inspiration from the departure of former members Miller and Scallions as well as from his own relationship troubles. Bell had most of the album written and demoed before Green joined the group. For the recording of the album, Fuel hired on producer Scott Humphrey, who had previously worked with Rob Zombie and M√∂tley Cr√ºe. Bell liked working and recording in Humphrey's studio, as Humphrey kept the instruments and amps miked up at all times, which allowed them to go back and change and/or add parts to songs that were recorded previously. According to Bell, \\"Most studios, as soon as you do the drums they will tear down the drums... So with Scott‚Äôs setup, that alone adds a different level of what you can do with as far as the record goes and as far as production style goes.\\" Angels & Devils is the first Fuel album where outside collaborators are credited in the songwriting. Promotion The first single released off of the album was \\"Wasted Time,\\" and was followed by \\"Gone\\" on October 23. The video to \\"Wasted Time\\" was released on September 24, there has been no mention about the possibility of a video being produced for \\"Gone.\\" On August 10, the band performed \\"Wasted Time\\" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.Fuel to perform on Tonight Show with Jay Leno , WWE has used two songs off this album. \\"Gone\\" for their pay-per-view event Vengeance: Night of Champions, and \\"Leave the Memories Alone\\" for their tribute videos to the retiring wrestler Ric Flair.

While not many significant publications reviewed the album, critical response to Angels & Devils was largely marginal to negative. Many reviews echoed that the end result was solid but bland. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described the album as having decreased Fuel's heaviness, brightened up their production, and become more \\"generic\\" in having such a precise vocalist. He lamented, \\"The end result is pleasant but forgettable, something no rock band should be.\\" PopMatters' Andrew Blackie described the album as \\"an ultimately frustrating listen, awash in exaggerated dynamics and production but with no soul, one hook-filled standout sandwiched between horrible, corny, outdated post-grunge.\\" In addition to criticizing the overly depressing and pessimistic lyrics, Blackie considered songwriter Carl Bell \\"a man afraid to commit and trust.\\" And while noting that some of Fuel's hallmarks are still intact, he regarded Angels & Devils \\"merely a solid rock album, when it really had the potential to be great.\\" The album did, however, receive a heavily positive response from LiveDaily's Paul Gargano who claimed that it \\"succeeds because it doesn't try to be anything more than Fuel has ever been.\\" Regarding vocalist Toryn Green, he noted the album \\"suffers none musically. . . In fact, in terms of sheer vocal ability, Fuel might be better served by the previously-unheard-of frontman.\\" Gargano favorably highlighted numerous songs and repeatedly noted how Fuel's \\"middle-of-the-road arena rock\\" serves the band well.

Hymes developed this model as part of a new methodology referred to as the ethnography of speaking. This model is a tool to assist the identification and labeling of components of interactional linguistics that was driven by his view that, in order to speak a language correctly, one needs not only to learn its vocabulary and grammar, but also the context in which words are used. In essence, the learning the components of the SPEAKING model is essential for linguistic competence. To facilitate the application of his representation, Hymes constructed the mnemonic, S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G (for setting and scene, participants, ends, acts sequence, key, instrumentalities, norms, & genre) under which he grouped the sixteen components within eight divisions.Note that the categories are simply listed in the order demanded by the mnemonic, not by importance The model had sixteen components that can be applied to many sorts of discourse: message form; message content; setting; scene; speaker/sender; addressor; hearer/receiver/audience; addressee; purposes (outcomes); purposes (goals); key; channels; forms of speech; norms of interaction; norms of interpretation; and genres.Hymes, D. (1974). Foundations in Sociolinguistics: An Ethnographic Approach. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, p.53-62. The SPEAKING model is used by linguistic anthropologists to analyze speech events (one or more speech acts involving one more participants) as part of an ethnography. This approach can be used to understand relationships and power dynamics within a given speech community and provide insight on cultural values.  Divisions  =Setting and Scene= \\"Setting refers to the time and place of a speech act and, in general, to the physical circumstances\\".Hymes (1974), p.55. The living room in the grandparents' home might be a setting for a family story. Scene is the \\"psychological setting\\" or \\"cultural definition\\" of a scene, including characteristics such as range of formality and sense of play or seriousness.Hymes (1974), pp.55-56. The family story may be told at a reunion celebrating the grandparents' anniversary. At times, the family would be festive and playful; at other times, serious and commemorative. Setting and scene also refer to implicit rules and expectations surrounding the speech event. For instance, the setting of the speech event determines who should speak and who should not, what type of speech is appropriate (code-switching), and when interrupting is acceptable. For instance, speech events in the classroom have specific implicit rules for teachers speaking and students listening, certain words are not viewed as appropriate in the classroom, and interrupting is often met with consequences. Conversely, different implicit rules and expectations apply at social gatherings and work settings. Setting of the speech event also refers to the location of participants and any physical barriers that may be present. For instance, whether participants are facing one another, what body language they are exhibiting, and whether or not they are separated by a table, chairs, or space in the room. Documentation of the physical setting is especially useful for completing an ethnography of a given community. =Participants= Participants include the speaker and the audience. Linguist anthropologists will make distinctions within these categories. The audience may include those to whom the speech act is directed, and those who are not addressed but overhear.Hymes (1974), pp.54 and 56. For example, at the family reunion, an aunt might tell a story to the young female relatives, but males, although not addressed, might also hear the narrative. When considering the participants in a speech event, one should consider implicit and explicit rules about who is, can, and should be involved; what expectations are established for the participants; who is speaking and who is being addressed. Certain ideologies are at play regarding participants in speech events. For instance, cultural norms about how child should speak to adults, how ladies should speak around men, how employees should speak to their boss. Each participant in a speech event is operating with specific rules and expectations, which are important for linguistic competence. =Ends= The end of the speech event are the purposes, goals, and outcomes.Hymes (1974), pp.56-57. The aunt may tell a story about the grandmother to entertain the audience, teach the young women, and honor the grandmother. Additionally, the ends of a speech event may differ for those participating. The exampled provided by Harriet Joseph Ottenheimer was that of a tourist seeking directions and a New Yorker providing vague answers, \\"your goal may be to get information and get to your destination, but their goal is to appear knowledgeable.\\" Differences in the goals and outcomes for speech events can be frequent, especially in classrooms and work spaced. Similarities and differences in the ends of a speech events are important for successful communication and acceptance into a culture or a speech community. =Act Sequence= Act sequence refers to the sequence of speech acts that make up the event. The order of speech acts greatly influences the speech event. For instance the initial speech acts sets the tone for the conversation; beginning a lecture by saying, \\"Ladies and gentlemen...\\" sets a different tone than beginning a lecture by saying, \\"Hello! How is everyone today?\\" Act sequence for an event also orients the participants to social cues. Important aspects of act sequence include turn-taking and interrupting. For example, an aunt's story might begin as a response to a toast to the grandmother; the story's plot and development would have a sequence structured by the aunt. Possibly there would be a collaborative interruption during the telling. Finally, the group might applaud the tale and move onto another subject or activity. =Key= \\"Key\\" refers to the clues that establish the \\"tone, manner, or spirit\\" of the speech act. The aunt might imitate the grandmother's voice and gestures in a playful way, or she might address the group in a serious voice emphasizing the sincerity and respect of the praise the story expresses. Generally, different keys are used in different situations, for instance different tones are used at birthday parties and funerals. Intonation in sentences can provide additional meaning; lighter tones communicate humor and friendship, meanwhile monotone speech acts communicate seriousness or a lack of emotion. Similarly, keys can be formal or informal, and can be influenced by word choice. For instance informal keys include the use of contractions (can't instead of cannot), use of slang or profanity, condensed or loose pronunciations (gonna), missing infinitives (\\"the kids need bathed\\" versus \\"the kids need to be bathed), and prepositional endings \\"what did you do that for?\\" Overall, the key in a speech act adds a human element to communication and provides valuable information for informing social norms and expectations for the speech event. Proper application of the appropriate key in a speech event is vital for linguistic competence. =Instrumentalities= Instrumentalities are the channels used to complete the speech act. These include the method of communication (writing, speaking, signing or signaling), the language, dialect (a mutually intelligible subset of a language) or register (a variety of a language that is used in specific settings). Hymes described these instrumentalities generally as the Forms and styles of speech.Hymes (1974), pp.58-60. For example, the instrumentality of the spoken word is different from the written word; the language spoken is unique to the speech act, as is the dialect. Similarly, the register that is spoken influences the speech event. For example, an aunt might speak in a casual register with many dialect features, but if her niece continues the conversation in a more formal register with careful grammatically \\"standard\\" forms the conversation may seem awkward. =Norms= Social rules governing the event and the participants' actions and reactions. In a playful story by the aunt, the norms might allow many audience interruptions and collaboration, or possibly those interruptions might be limited to participation by older females. A serious, formal story by the aunt might call for attention to her and no interruptions as norms. Norms will vary for each speech community. Examples of questions regarding established norms include: * When is it okay to speak? * Who should listen? * When is silence preferred? * How loud is too loud? * What speed should be used in the conversation? * What topics are acceptable? =Genre= The kind of speech act or event; for the example used here, the kind of story. The aunt might tell a character anecdote about the grandmother for entertainment, or an exemplum as moral instruction. Different disciplines develop terms for kinds of speech acts, and speech communities sometimes have their own terms for types.Anticipating that he might be accused of creating an (English language) \\"ethnocentric\\" mnemonic ‚Äî and, thus, by implication, an (English language) \\"ethnocentric\\" theory ‚Äî Hymes comments that he could have, for instance, generated a French language mnemonic of P-A-R-L- A-N-T: namely, participants, actes, raison (resultat), locale, agents (instrumentalities), normes, ton (key), types (genres) (1974, p.62). Other examples of speech genres include gossip, jokes, and conversations.  Rich Points  Rich points are instances where there is a disconnect between two speakers in a speech event resulting from differences in perceived implicit rules and expectations. These instances represent a conflict in the SPEAKING model between two people. This difference and the negotiation to reestablish the conversation is referred to as MAR (Mistake, Awareness, Repair) = Mistake = Mistakes in conversation occur when participants in the conversation are operating with different implicit rules and expectations for the SPEAKING model. Mistakes often results from disagreements about inclusion of participants, mismatched ends, unexpected act sequences, keys or instrumentalities. In general mistakes and conflicts arise when there is a deviation in the conversation from the norm. In some genres, such as gossip, rapid turn-taking and interrupting is not only accepted, but expected. If one participant is not active in this type of speech they may come across as ambivalent to the conversation; this would be an example of a mistake. = Awareness = Awareness occurs when one or more of the participants recognized the differences in expectations for the conversation. In some cases, this may mean that one speaker recognizes that the other is speaking faster or slower, using act sequences that rely heavily on fast turn-taking or accepted interrupting, speaking in a more formal or informal register, etc. In the instance of gossip, it would be important to recognize if one is not matching the speech pattern. = Repair = Repair of the conversation occurs when one or more participants in the speech event change one or more of the SPEAKING components in order to ameliorate the mistake. In some instances this may mean that the speaker increases the speed of their speech, participates in rapid turn-taking and interrupting. When repair does not occur the speech event can seem awkward. However, when one learns to repair speech events they can more easily connect with participants in the speech event, building rapport.Speaking through by maintaining grammartical rules for understand correctly.  Applications  = Standard (Linguistic) = The speaking model has been applied to understand a variety of communities and situations. Speech events are key to the foundation of culture, thus they are the subject of much analysis. Many people have approached the application of the SPEAKING model to understand conversations in unique populations and settings, to better understand the interplay between culture and language, and to analyze status, power and inequality. = Non-standard = In the rise of a variety of ERP (such as D365BC) and other software, the SPEAKING model has been relied upon to build a framework for the analysis of computer programs to help companies and individuals obtain comparable results to choose from multiple options available.

September 1923. In Javanese wayang (shadow puppets), the panakawan or panakavan (phanakavhan) are the clown servants of the hero. There are four of them ‚Äì Semar (also known as Ki Lurah Semar), Petruk, Gareng and Bagong. Semar is the personification of a deity, sometimes said to be the dhanyang or guardian spirit of the island of Java. In Javanese mythology, deities can only manifest themselves as ugly or otherwise unprepossessing humans, and so Semar is always portrayed as short and fat with a pug nose and a dangling hernia. His three companions are his adopted sons, given to Semar as votaries by their parents. Petruk is portrayed as tall and gangling with a long nose, Gareng as short with a club foot and Bagong as obese. The panakawan always appear in the second act of a wayang performance ‚Äì pathet sanga ‚Äì as servants to the hero of the story regardless of who that hero is. Similar characters appear in other Indonesian wayang and theatrical traditions, including those of Bali and Sunda, under different names. The panakawan characters are generally much-loved by audiences who attend wayang plays in Indonesia and their appearance in the plays is usually greeted with laughter and anticipation.

It is set on a site in the district of Knotty Ash, Liverpool, England. It should not be confused with Thingwall Hall, a local stately home just a few minutes walk further south. In 1921 it was bequeathed by the Bright family to the city of Liverpool on condition that it was held in trust to be used as a home for 'girls of feeble mind'. It was owned by the Knotty Ash Special School Trust with Liverpool City Council serving as its trustees. Campaign for refurbishment By the late 1990s the site was disused and proposals were put forward by property developers for the site to be used as a housing estate, but which was subsequently defeated by conservation campaigners. In 2003 comedian Ken Dodd began a campaign to use the building to house a national archive, museum and school of British comedy. He also offered to donate his own private collection of comedy memorabilia for the museum. The proposal also included plans for the grounds to become a wildlife haven and park. The campaign was supported by the local newspaper, the Liverpool Echo in its Stop the Rot campaign aimed at saving local architecture and heritage. In November 2003 the building was partially destroyed by an arson attack that had been predicted by Ken Dodd and other campaigners due to a lack of security on the site. Campaigners accused the council of deliberately supplying the house and grounds with inadequate security, with the further suggestion that if the building was vandalised beyond recovery the council could then argue there could be no public objections to selling the site for property development. A further arson attack in May 2004 badly damaged the first and second floors of the building and destroyed the roof, also causing a partial collapse in a large section of the house while the fire was still blazing. Shortly thereafter the remaining part of the house was bulldozed by the council on the grounds of health and safety. However the campaigners still insisted that the park and grounds should be preserved and that the land not be used for development. Ken Dodd and the Knotty Ash Village Conservation Society then put forward proposals for the site to become a nature reserve for children with special learning needs, supported by Mersey Forest and the Forestry Commission. In April 2006 and with campaigners having raised ¬£80,000 the overgrown site was once again damaged by vandals, this time trees were vandalised and burned before work could begin on the proposed outdoor centre. On 15 February 2008 Liverpool City Council's agreed to hand over the land to Love and Joy Ministries. Planned facilities at the nature garden include an eco house and a visitor centre. For various reasons the council delayed handing over the land to Love and Joy Ministries, however at the end of 2011 it finally did, with the land expected to be made usable by the end of 2012 and will be run by a new charity set up by LJM called Bright Park References External links *News report of the fire *Picture of the lodge on the site, the main building having been bulldozed Category:History of Liverpool Category:Country houses in Merseyside Category:Former buildings and structures in Liverpool Category:Buildings and structures in the United Kingdom destroyed by arson ","title":"Thingwall House"},{"id":"11865897","text":"Legislative elections were held in Kazakhstan on 18 August 2007.

The dam is part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a vast hydroelectricity and irrigation complex constructed in south-east Australia between 1949 and 1974 and now run by Snowy Hydro. The purpose of the dam includes water management and conservation, with much of the impounded headwaters diverted to Lake Eucumbene. The impounded reservoir is called Tantangara Reservoir. Location and features Commenced in 1958 and completed in 1960, the Tantangara Dam is located on the Murrumbidgee River, approximately downstream of its confluence with Gurrangorambla Creek and is wholly within the Kosciuszko National Park. Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra of Kent visited the dam in 1959, during its construction. The dam was constructed by Utah-Brown & Root Sudamericana on behalf of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, and is now managed by Snowy Hydro Limited. The concrete gravity dam of is high with a crest length of . At 100% capacity, the dam wall holds back of water. The surface area of Tantangara Reservoir is and the catchment area is . The spillway across the Murrumbidgee River is capable of discharging . Water flows 16.6 km from Tantangara Reservoir to Lake Eucumbene via the 3.1 to 3.35m diameter Murrumbidgee-Eucumbene tunnel falling 40 m in the process. Flow is controlled by a 1.83 x 2.13 m regulating gate such that a maximum of 20 cumecs is allowed. Flow downstream into the Murrumbidgee River is controlled at the dam and comprises two by high shafts, from the outlet works tower and tapering to diameter before passing through a diameter nozzle to river diversion tunnel, with a capacity of . =Water flows= Environmental Water The Snowy Water Initiative (SWI) is an agreement for water recovery and environmental flows between the NSW, Victorian and Australian Governments, and Snowy Hydro Limited (SHL) which is set out in the Snowy Water Inquiry Outcomes Implementation Deed 2002 (SWIOID 2002). The SWI provides three main environmental water programs as part of rebalancing the impacts of the Snowy Hydro Scheme on montane rivers. These three programs are increased flows for: (i) Snowy River, (ii) River Murray, and (iii) Snowy Montane Rivers. Williams (2017) Ecological process: the basis for flow based river rehabilitation in the Snowy Montane Rivers, 2017-18url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316739410_Ecological_process_the_basis_for_flow_based_river_rehabilitation_in_the_Snowy_Montane_Rivers The Snowy Montane River Increased Flows (SMRIF) program identifies five montane rivers to receive environmental water. The water availability for SMRIF is linked to the water availability for Snowy River Increased Flows (SRIF) (Williams 2017), which is determined by the water recovery in the western rivers and the preceding climatic conditions. The SWIOID 2002 provides for SHL to forego up to 150 Giga Watt hours (GWHrs) of electricity generation to allow for environmental releases to be made to SMRIF. This value of 150 GWHrs is converted into a volumetric allocation, but the conversion factor differs depending on the location of the releases in the Snowy Mountains Scheme, and thus influence the overall volume released. In some locations water released can be re-used to generate electricity so a smaller conversion factor is applied (SWIOID 2002), however, where water is lost to the Snowy Scheme a higher conversion factor is applied. Releases to the Murrumbidgee River are made from Tantangara dam, a much larger structure than the other release points, for which a gated release structure is available. Accordingly, the daily flow release strategy for the Murrumbidgee River differs from the other SMRIF release points. The releases comprise two components: (i) the SMRIF and (ii) a Base Passing Flow (BPF). The BPF has some key components, these being: * A 2GL year volume is targeted over the longer term. * A 32 ML/day discharge is to be targeted at Mittagang Crossing, near Cooma. * A maximum of 3.5GL is set for any one year. The Base Passing Flow releases typically occur during drier weather. A modified ‚Äòflow scaling‚Äô approach used to set SRIF releases to the Snowy River has also been applied to the SMRIF in the Murrumbidgee River (Williams S. (2014) Strategy for the Snowy Montane Rivers Increased Flows 2014-15. NSW Government, Sydney.; Williams S. (2015) Strategy for the Snowy Montane Rivers Increased Flows 2015-16. NSW Government, Sydney.5; Williams S. (2016) Strategy for the Snowy Montane Rivers Increased Flows 2016-17. NSW Government, Sydney.; Williams S. (2017) Ecological process: the basis for flow based river rehabilitation in the Snowy Montane Rivers. NSW Government, Sydney ). This modified approach uses the recorded flows in a nearby natural catchment (in a year where similar volumes of flow occurred) to set daily releases. For releases to the Murrumbidgee River from Tantangara dam, the initial daily flow targets were set using the flow sequence for the Murrumbidgee River above Tantangara (station No. 410535). Daily targets are then amended to account for operational implementation. The SWIOID 2002 identifies a target of 27GL (i.e. 30% of the Mean Annual Natural Flow- MANF) in a full allocation scenario. Since 2005-06, environmental water has been released to the Upper Murrumbidgee River to repair the condition of the river. Over the period 2005 to 2018, an average of 17.7GL/year of environmental water has been released to the upper Murrumbidgee River. The annual allocation varied between 4 GL/ year during the drought and 42.3 GL /year once sufficient water had been recovered. The environmental water portfolio does not allow for environmental water to be released everyday of the year from Tantangara Dam. Over the period 2005 to 2018, various environmental flow strategies have attempted to re-instate a winter-spring montane flow pattern. These approaches have attempted to improve instream habitat and ecological processes as the basis for river recovery, rather than the traditional Australian e-water approach of managing rarity of aquatic biota. A 2011 report by the Snowy Scientific Committee stated that the Tantangara Dam was starving the upper Murrumbidgee River of environmental water flows from the Snowy Mountains; needed to restore river health. The committee claimed that there was an apparent \\"administrative and managerial void\\", with no river management strategy and no proper monitoring because of a lack of regulatory resources. Total annual water released from Tantangara Dam (i) Base Passing Flows and (ii) Environmental water to the Murrumbidgee River, 2002-03-2017-18. The Murrumbidgee River below Tantangara Dam Water Transfers In 2005, the Australian Capital Territory Government explored the options of augmenting water supply for Canberra by developing a long tunnel alternative including weir, connecting tunnel, outflow pipes, and hydro-power plant construction to link the Murrumbidgee with Corin Reservoir; and/or a Murrumbidgee River flow alternative including weir, pumping station and pipeline construction to link the Murrumbidgee with Googong Reservoir. In 2009, the ACT Government endorsed a recommendation from ACTEW for implementation of the Tantangara Transfer Project, that involves transferring water from the Murrumbidgee River (below the Burrinjuck and Blowering dams) in New South Wales to the ACT via the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Recreation Water levels are held at 20% in the summer months so that the Port Philip Trail remains above the water. There are good populations of both brown trout and rainbow trout within the reservoir. The wet winter of 2016 saw levels exceed 70% in October- the highest for 2 decades.

They first rose to fame when they were finalists in the first series of the British television talent show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, in which they lost to the eventual winner, singer Paul Potts. The Bar Wizards started off as bartenders but now perform their Tandem Flair Show worldwide, and bartend at private parties. Background The Bar Wizards are from Manchester. Garner originally worked as a bartender in Stockport and Lowrey in Blackley. They met while competing in flare bartending competitions and teamed up as a double act. Bar Wizards International came into being in early 2005, as a result of a partnership between Lowrey and Garner. The pair already had ten years experience in the bar industry and had worked in over fifty countries. This led them to make a show which they believed would allow them to work as performers and entertainers. =Tandem Flair Show= The main performance of the Bar Wizards is their Tandem Flair show which they created. They then promoted their new show around the United Kingdom, and soon found interest in the corporate market as an after dinner show, allowing them the opportunity to develop the routine, and hone their tandem skills, whilst experimenting with new moves, music and themes. This culminated in a performance at the 2006 Roadhouse World Finals in Covent Garden, London. The act uses a variety of different tricks and music including Queen's \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\", \\"I Believe in a Thing Called Love\\" by The Darkness, and \\"Freedom\\" by Aretha Franklin. Their act includes flipping, spinning, throwing, catching, shaking and pouring their way through a routine using bottles, tins, glasses, and bar equipment. Britain's Got Talent The Bar Wizards were one of the finalists in the show and one of just two acts in the final featuring more than one person, with the other being Kombat Breakers. The Bar Wizards act consisted of flair bartending, juggling and throwing glass bottles and cocktail tins, all choreographed to music. At the finale of their act they rainbow poured drinks (up to six at one time) in Red, White and Blue to match their \\"British Theme\\". The Bar Wizards responded to criticism that their act was not varied enough to perform at the Royal Variety Performance by adding new elements, such as hitting each other over the head with sugar bottles. Overall judges comments were positive with judge Piers Morgan describing them as \\"highly amusing\\". Other work The Bar Wizards have also appeared on GMTV, as well as being the mystery guests on an episode of A Question of Sport on BBC One and have appeared on The Paul O'Grady Show. They were extras in the film Basic Instinct 2 and have appeared on China Central Television, Channel M television station based in Manchester and Britain's Next Top Model. They have made a number of guest appearances such as the opening of a new caf√© bar at the Scarborough campus of the University of Hull. The Bar Wizards were part of Hellmann's Mayonnaise squeezy campaign in a television commercial and web campaign \\"Squeezy Skills\\" where they displayed other uses for their flair skills by making sandwiches using flair bartending. The Bar Wizards continue to event bartend, have also developed a mobile cocktail bar service. They also run Flair and Mixology training courses, where they train flair bartenders. As a reward for winning the task, on the first episode of the fifth series of the BBC One show The Apprentice the boys' team was treated to a cocktail made by 'The Bar Wizards'. They were featured on Guinness World Records Smashed, where they set a new World Record They went into business together in 2009, opening their own bar/restaurant in Littleborough, Rochdale, called \\"The Barwizards Lounge\\".

At university, he came into contact with Rose Li, one of the lecturers, who taught Cook t'ai chi ch'uan. In 1970, Cook established the Durham University Karate Club,Seijinkai Karatedo Association: History Retrieved on 18 February 2010. which became affiliated to the Karate Union of Great Britain. He was tested for 1st kyu by Andy Sherry. In 1973, Cook received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chinese studies from Durham University. A year later, he earned a Postgraduate Certificate in Education from the same institution. Career Cook embarked on a career as a schoolteacher, but this was to be short-lived‚Äîonly around two years. He successfully applied for a job in Japan. Cook had originally planned to travel to China, but, as he recalled in a 1988 interview, \\"at that time it was difficult to enter, so I opted for Japan as it was more Westernized and more modern.\\" Arriving in Japan in the mid-1970s, Cook started work as a teacher of the English language. He had intended to visit the Japan Karate Association, but Terry O'Neill recommended visiting Morio Higaonna's Goju-ryu karate dojo, which Cook did. While he trained under Hirokazu Kanazawa occasionally, and also studied sword and stick fighting arts, most of his training was under Higaonna. In interviews conducted years later, Cook would speak very positively of Higaonna. After two years, Cook had reached 2nd dan. His work contract completed, he returned to England, but only stayed six months before coming back to Japan. He settled in Kyoto and began studying butokukan and naginata. Cook eventually returned to the United Kingdom, and was based in Haltwhistle, Northumberland.Traditional Japanese Shotokan Karate Academy: Shotokan Karate ‚Äì A precise history Retrieved on 18 February 2010. Cook founded his own school, the Seijinkai Karatedo Association, to teach his blend of Shotokan and Goju-ryu karate styles. The association now has branches in Ireland, Norway, and the United States of America, as well as the United Kingdom. In May 2011, Cook appeared in Newcastle Magistrates' Court facing charges of sexual assault. He pleaded guilty to charges in regard to a female from March 2006 to February 2011 and was held on remand awaiting sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court. In January 2012, Cook pleaded guilty to a further 29 charges, including indecent assault, sexual assault, making indecent images of children and possessing indecent images of children, a pornographic image of a child and a prohibited image of a child. In June 2012, he was sentenced to 10 years. Cook's family, who have renounced him, expressed their support and sympathy for the victims, and their utter condemnation of his actions.

The name alludes to the various ethnic origins of the members. Name and Identification All ethnic groups were encouraged to join thus the gang name, the United Nations (UN) or Global United Nations Syndicate (GUNS). The multi-racial gang consists primarily of Canadians of European, East Asian, First Nations, and Iranian background. The U.N. gang had pioneered an alternative sense of style and recognition that became prominent in Vancouver, BC up until the end of the early 2010s. Many U.N. members would \\"cloak\\" themselves by wearing high-end, expensive and luxury brands based on California surf-trends, biker brands and accessories that would not typically be assumed as what a gangster would wear. Many youth imitated this style before the end of around 2012. Common items included murses, high-end active wear, designer jeans, baseball caps, sandals and name brand belts. This has become a well known sense of gangster appearance in BC due to the United Nations. History =Formation= The UN gang was formed in Abbotsford in 1997 by a group of high-school friends from around the Fraser Valley. The founder of the gang was Clay Roueche, a white Canadian who grew up surrounded by Vietnamese-Canadians and Lao-Canadians. Roueche came to develop an Asian fetish as he was described as spending much of his time in Abbotsford's Vietnamtown where he loved: \\"...the fortunetellers he‚Äôd find there, grainy bootlegged kung-fu movies and Vietnamese girls\\". A Korean- Canadian said of him: \\"Clay was never white. Maybe he was born white, but his soul was never white.\\" After graduating from high school in 1993, Rouche worked in a variety of sales jobs and opened a restaurant which soon failed. Rouche began to work for a Vietnamese organized crime figure known as Vu. What began as a loose-knit group of Abbotsford thugs linked to Asian organized crime grew quickly over the years. They began a profitable drug-running enterprise involving helicopters flying across the US-Canada border trading much sought after British Columbian cannabis for cocaine to be sold in Canada. The United Nations gang was founded in May 1997. Rouche discovered that the Kootenays region was where most of the marijuana in British Columbia was grown and starting in 1997 began to export marijuana to the United States. With his new wealth, Rouche married a Lao-Canadian woman and purchased an expensive house. The name United Nations was coined at a party hosted by Rouche in Richmond when somebody commented upon the racially diverse crowd by saying: \\"What the fuck is this, an United Nations meeting?\\" Rouche borrowed much from Asian culture for his gang. Rouche took aspects of Bushido (\\"the way of the warrior\\"), the fierce code of the Japanese samurai, as the basis of the gang's philosophy, using the motto \\"Honor, loyalty, respect\\". All the members of the gang are expected to have phrase \\"honor, loyalty, respect\\" tattooed on themselves in Chinese characters and their uniform were hoodies covered with images of tigers and Asian dragons together with the phrase \\"honor, loyalty, respect\\" in Chinese characters . Members were expected to learn mixed martial arts, especially Thai kickboxing and Japanese jujitsu. Initiation ceremonies were based on those of the Chinese Triads under which new members would walk under \\"The Mountain of Knives\\" as an archway of swords were named to swear eternal loyalty to the \\"36 Oaths\\" of the gang and drinking a bowel of rooster's blood. A senior member was a dai lo (Cantonese for \\"big brother\\") who would supervise the other members who were given much freedom to operate as they pleased. The gang initially avoided the rigidly hierarchical and authoritarian structure of traditional organized crime groups like the Mafia and outlaw biker clubs such as the Hells Angels. Under the impact of gang wars, greater discipline was needed and Rouche has admitted in an interview that he ordered the beatings and the torture of gang members who disobeyed his orders, through he also claimed not to enjoy it. The dominant organized crime group in British Columbia as in much of the rest of Canada are the Hells Angels, who only accept whites, and as such the United Nations gang attracted non-white members, usually second-generation Vietnamese-Canadians and Lao- Canadians. In 2000, the United Nations gang were involved in a notably bloody brawl with the Hells Angels at the Animals nightclub in Abbotsford, which gave the gang stature in the underworld after beating up the Angels. A group of 70 United Nations members fought and expelled 30 Hells Angels from the Animals nightclub, which was perceived as \\"theirs\\". As a new criminal organization, the group fought a number of turf wars against other gangs, most notably the Red Scorpions. They also led a turf war against the Independent Soldiers gang, as it sought to establish itself. After establishing themselves against the Hells Angels, the two gangs reached a modus vivendi in 2005. One of its biggest rivals was the Hells Angels but recently the two groups have been working together as some of the UN's high-ranking members became Hells Angels and also shown by the arrest of Omid Bayani, a mid-level member of the Hells Angels, who was arrested as part of an investigation looking at criminal actions of the Hells Angels. After Rouche's arrest in the United States in 2008, leadership was assumed by Barzan Tilli-Choli. =Relationship with the Hells Angels= On 8 May 2008, former Hells Angels head hunter and UN gang member Duane Harvey Meyer, 41 and nicknamed D.W., was killed, with the funeral held on May 15, 2008. Full members of the Hells Angels and UN gang members were at the funeral, with news stations and police agencies on hand to videotape all visitors. Whenever a United Nations member dies, he gets a special tombstone featuring the letters \\"UN\\" across it. =Arrests= Before a number of its leaders were arrested the police estimated the gang had 50-100 core members in the Lower Mainland area of B.C. The alleged leader of the United Nations Gang is Clayton Roueche. Roueche grew up in Chilliwack, B.C. He later moved out to Abbotsford, B.C. and then on to Vancouver. Roueche had an obsession with martial arts and became involved in the drug scene at an early age. As part of an American investigation into drug trafficking on a stopover in Texas on a flight from Mexico City May 17, 2008, Roueche was arrested for conspiring to possess cocaine, conspiring to export cocaine, conspiring to import marijuana, and conspiring to launder money and was subsequently deported to the United States. Roueche faced up to a maximum of 220 years in prison, but he was sentenced to 30 years and $8 million in fines. He was flown to Seattle to answer to the charges. Other members arrested as part of the international investigation were UN members Kris Neri, Daryl Johnson and Douglas Vanalstine. Jong Ca John Lee is believed to have supplied the gang with guns. On June 9, 2007, the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) was called to his residence due to an unanswered 911 call. Lee answered the door, and police saw what looked like firearms inside the apartment. A subsequent search revealed a dozen guns (some loaded, and some with defaced serial numbers), including automatic and semi-automatic rifles, and almost two dozen magazines of ammunition. Lee, who had no criminal record, pleaded guilty in September 2007 to all 10 charges. Lee also pleaded guilty to possession of 3.5 kilograms of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, 900 grams of marijuana, a Panther stun gun, a silencer, and three stolen Canadian passports obtained through a home invasion. He was sentenced to five years each on two of the weapons charges and two years on each of the other charges, to be served concurrently. The former de facto leader of the United Nations gang was Barzan Tilli-Choli, an Iraqi immigrant responsible for a myriad of crimes, none more infamous than his conspiracy to murder the notorious Bacon brothers (the Bacon brothers are believed to be high-ranking members of the rival Red Scorpions Gang). Tilli- Choli's elaborate plot to murder the Bacon brothers manifested in his arrest in April 2009, along with Dilun Hung, Aram Ali, Ion Croitoru, Daniel Russell, and realtor Soroush Ansari 2004 saw the arrest at a Calgary hotel of drug and chemical importer, Paul Vincent. Known for his unmatched ability to circumnavigate border security, Vincent was in possession of a vehicle-mounted Bren machine gun, a number of barrels of banned chemicals and $585,000 in cash. In a lengthy trial, the prosecution sought a 21-year sentence. The trial was brought to close with a dismissal due to an evidence-seizure technicality. Involvement in 2009 Vancouver gang violence In late 2008 and early 2009, a violent gang war was brewing in the Lower Mainland area of B.C., with the UN gang believed to be playing a major role in it. Police have issued warnings to the public in regard to associating with Jonathan (Jon), Jarrod, and James (Jamie) Bacon, as well as Dennis Karbovanec. Known as the \\"Bacon Brothers,\\" they have been targeted by other gangs and criminal organizations. Eldest brother Jonathan Bacon survived an attempt on his life in front of his parents' home. There have also been numerous attempts on the lives of youngest brother James. The United Nations gang is believed by police and media to be the group responsible for these attacks. The Bacons are linked up with Michael Le's Red Scorpion gang from the Lower Mainland. On Sunday August 14, 2011 Jonathan Bacon was shot dead in Kelowna. Three offenders are currently serving lengthy sentences in regards to this murder.  Structure  = Hierarchy = After expanding to other parts of Canada, the criminal organization became more structured. It adopted a hierarchy system using military ranks. Each province in the country is attributed a Commander who chooses different Generals for each city. This method of work enabled the high-ranked members of the organization to stay more discreet and safe from police arrests as their identities stay unknown. According to a 2016 presentation by Sgt. Doug Spencer of the RCMP & The Odd Squad Productions, The gang currently has no hierarchy. A large percentage of the original members are all either in prison, dead, deported or have disappeared. Some members still continue to exist, however only living off the name U.N.

The RMWR concept builds upon the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor and is under active development in theoretical studies, particularly in Japan. Hitachi and the Japan Atomic Energy Agency are both involved in research. Even in Generation II PWRs, the neutron spectrum is not fully thermalised. The goal of the RMWR is to depart further from the thermal neutron spectrum in order to achieve a breeder ratio of slightly greater than one, so that after the initial fuel charge no enrichment of the uranium input to the fuel cycle is required. The RMWR concept is dependent on nuclear fuel reprocessing in order to achieve its objective of a resource renewable fuel cycle. Hitachi has proposed the FLUOREX process as reprocessing technology for this purpose, instead of the more conventional Purex technology. In contrast to regular light water reactors and in order to achieve a harder neutron spectrum, which is optimal for breeding purposes, the RMWR uses hexagonal fuel assemblies and Y-shaped control rods. The fuel is MOX (Mixed Oxide), consisting of 18% plutonium, which is surrounded by depleted uranium in the blanket region. Another RMWR breeder design intends on closing the nuclear fuel cycle by mixing thorium with reprocessed transuranics, which include plutonium, in a thorium containing MOX fuel. The neutron speed would be in the spectrum that could purportedly transmutate the long-lived fission products like Tc-99 & I-127 and as the neutron spectrum is hard/fast enough, to also be capable of burning the usually troublesome minor actinides quite efficiently.http://www.the-weinberg- foundation.org/2013/04/05/how-thorium-can-solve-the-nuclear-waste-problem-in- conventional- reactors/http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/stories/2012/safer_nuclear_future/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guanheng_Zhang/publication/283084524_Comparison_of_Reduced- moderation_Boiling_Water_Reactor_and_Sodium- cooled_Fast_Reactor_Technologies/links/5728b41808ae057b0a03306b/Comparison-of- Reduced-moderation-Boiling-Water-Reactor-and-Sodium-cooled-Fast-Reactor- Technologies.pdf?origin=publication_detail Hitachi announced a collaboration with three U.S. universities on the development of the RBWR/RMWR in 2014.http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/WR-Hitachi-collaborates-on-TRU- consuming-reactor- development-2908144.htmlhttp://www.hitachi.com/rev/pdf/2014/r2014_09_103.pdf See also * Supercritical water reactor, a similar and perhaps even overlapping concept. * Clean And Environmentally Safe Advanced Reactor, preliminary work in the 1990s.

Specifically it describes the current response when the potential is a step function in time. It was derived by Frederick Gardner Cottrell in 1903. For a simple redox event, such as the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple, the current measured depends on the rate at which the analyte diffuses to the electrode. That is, the current is said to be \\"diffusion controlled.\\" The Cottrell equation describes the case for an electrode that is planar but can also be derived for spherical, cylindrical, and rectangular geometries by using the corresponding laplace operator and boundary conditions in conjunction with Fick's second law of diffusion.Bard, A.

Halder took people in the building hostage, and they ran and barricaded themselves and hid during the seven hours that the gunman roamed the building, shooting indiscriminately. He was finally apprehended by a SWAT team. Halder was convicted on multiple felony counts and sentenced to life in prison; he lost a 2008 appeal. Shooting Dressed in camouflage, 62-year-old Biswanath Halder, wearing a flak vest and carrying a semi-automatic rifle, entered the Peter B. Lewis Building of Case Western Reserve University on the afternoon of May 9, 2003. He started roaming the halls and shooting the rifle, quickly encountering Norman Wallace, a 30-year- old graduate student, whom he shot and killed. Hearing the shots, other people ran to get away from the gunman. As it was a Friday, the school had fewer students and staff around than at other times during the week, but nearly 100 people were trapped in the building. Police and authorities advised them by e-mail to hide and barricade their offices. Some hid in closets. The irregular design of the building by architect Frank Gehry provided the shooter with places of concealment, and he proceeded throughout the building, shooting at anyone he encountered. He exchanged frequent gunfire with law enforcement forces. For more than seven hours, Halder held off Cleveland city police, SWAT officers, FBI and forces of the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department. He conducted sniper-like gun battles from positions in the building, but they gradually forced him upward in the building. As the police and other forces were able to clear each floor of the five-story building, they escorted people to safety. Halder was ultimately apprehended by a SWAT team in a closet of a fifth-floor classroom.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3015873.stm \\"One killed in US school shooting\\", BBC, Last Updated: Saturday, 10 May 2003, accessed 9 October 2015 Victims *Norman Wallace, 30, first-year MBA student from Youngstown, Ohio, was killed. *Wounded, Avi Dor, Professor of Health Care Economics *Wounded, Susan Helper, Professor of Economics Perpetrator The suspect was identified as Biswanath Halder, a 62-year-old native of Calcutta, India.

The story combined the elements of the Superman mythos with Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein where that version of Superman is similar to the Frankenstein Monster. Written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, with art by Anthony Williams and Tom Palmer, The Superman Monster is the sequel to the DC Comics Elseworlds comic book Batman: Two Faces. Plot After hearing his friend Commissioner James Gordon's sinister tale at the Iceberg Lounge in Gotham City in 1888, newspaper magnate Peregrine White tells his own macabre story. White's tale takes place five years previously in a small Bavarian town called Ingolstadt, and concerns the exploits of Vicktor Luthor, a ruthless and amoral philosophy student and scientist. Luthor is expelled from the local college after his professors react in outrage to his unorthodox experiments in raising the dead, which they view as sacrilegious and abhorrent. Increasingly obsessed and isolated, Luthor plans to secure funds for his experiments by seducing and marrying Eloise Edge, the daughter of the wealthy local Burgermeister. However, on the night of their engagement party Luthor is informed by Burgomeister Edge that the betrothal contract will prevent Luthor from financially benefiting from the marriage. Furious, Luthor storms out of the party, only to witness a strange object fall from the sky into the nearby forest. Investigating the crash, Luthor discovers that the object is an advanced spacecraft containing the remains of an infant. Luthor accidentally activates a projection of the craft's designer, an alien scientist named Jor- El, and learns that the craft was intended to safely carry the scientist's son Kal-El from the destruction of their world Krypton. Luthor uses the information stored within the craft regarding Krypton, its science and technology to his advantage, and designs a \\"Revival Matrix\\" which he believes will reanimate the dead. Luthor constructs a body from parts sourced from a local grave robber, whom he murders to keep his activities secret, and uses the Revival Matrix to bring it to life. Much to Luthor's horror, however, the process goes awry, and the resulting creature is a malformed, heavily scarred and unnaturally pale \\"superman\\" with strange abilities beyond those of mortal men. When the creature identifies Luthor as his \\"father\\", Luthor reacts in disgust and rejects the creature; this leads to a scuffle that sees Luthor injured and his lab set on fire. Among the creature's abilities is flight and invulnerability, however, which he uses to rescue Luthor. Disorientated and frightened, the creature wanders into Ingolstadt, where he is overwhelmed by the noise and activity that his enhanced senses can pick up. Out of instinct, however, the creature intervenes to stop a carriage which has lost control and rescues the inhabitant, who turns out to be Eloise. Eloise treats the creature with kindness and gratitude, but the other townspeople are terrified by his appearance and abilities and chase him away. The creature eventually makes his way to an isolated farmstead owned by an elderly couple, Johan and Martha Kant. The kindly farmers, having recently lost their own son to war, take the creature in and treat him as their own, naming him \\"Klaus\\". Using his powers to help the Kants on their farm, Klaus begins to learn the ways of humanity and his monstrous appearance gradually becomes more human. While grateful to the Kants, Klaus admits that he wishes to resolve matters with his creator -- but his powerful abilities have been noticed, and reports have already made their way back to Luthor. Determined to conceal what he has done, Luthor bribes a militia to attack the Kant farmstead. Johan and Marta are killed in the struggle, and Klaus furiously attacks Luthor, only to be overwhelmed by a green stone that Luthor had recovered from the spacecraft and fashioned into a cane. Believing Klaus to be dead, Luthor returns to town to be married to Eloise, but before he can do so Klaus storms the ceremony and demands that Luthor face justice for his actions. Klaus and Eloise are surprised to recognise each other, however, and Luthor takes advantage of the confusion to try and shoot Klaus. The bullets bounce off Klaus's impenetrable skin and strike Eloise, killing her; enraged, Luthor brutally subdues Klaus with his cane. After the wedding guests depart Luthor, driven to the brink of insanity by events, murders Burgomeister Edge and steals Eloise's body, determined to reanimate her in the Revival Matrix. When his friend James Olufsen catches him and tries to stop him, Luthor shoots him; the dying James lands at the cellar where Klaus is imprisoned, trapped by the green stones. With his dying energy, James releases Klaus, who storms into the laboratory to confront Luthor only to discover that Luthor has successfully revived Eloise. Eloise, revived with a scarred and malformed appearance similar to Klaus' original appearance, is overwhelmed by her experiences and rejects Luthor. Klaus comforts Eloise and offers to help her adjust to her new life, which she accepts; when Luthor tries to stop them, he is battered away, causing a fire to break out and destroy the Revival Matrix. Klaus and Eloise, immune to the flames, embrace and fly away, leaving Luthor to his fate. Commissioner Gordon skeptically interrupts White's story, demanding to know how he knows what happened. White reveals that, while on a ship travelling to Archangel that had become trapped in ice, he and the crew had encountered Luthor, wandering the ice and driven mad by his experiences, desperately searching for a \\"fortress of solitude\\" where he believed Klaus and Eloise had eloped to. From Luthor's journals and his ramblings, White managed to piece together what had happened, but Luthor soon died of exposure. When accompanying Luthor's body, White was astonished when Klaus appeared, now glowing angelically. After using heat produced from his eyes to free the ship from the ice, Klaus takes Luthor's body and flies away.

Plot Fire Candy takes place in a near-future fictional Earth, where unexplained but worldwide hormonal discrepancies in the human species brought a catastrophic crackdown of humanity's ability to reproduce themselves, depriving them forever of such a natural asset. Searching for a way to prevent their own extinction, humans found a way out of the crisis by means of interbreeding with animals, thus giving birth to the so-called Halfs, hybrids between human beings and beasts. This story focuses on one group of such creatures, juveniles discriminated and loathed by ordinary humans, in their daily struggles. Ryoki and his gang acts as anti-heroes, given the fact that they often brawl, steal or maim, though always against other street delinquents. It's through their acts that they demonstrate to be all too human, even though being physically half-animals. Because the manga was never finished, what happened after the second volume is left unknown to this day. (there was a message at the end of the second volume hinting that the manga may resume in the future, it is only a slight possibility as the manga artist has shown no clear intent of finishing the series and may remain unfinished) Characters Ryoki: The main protagonist, a 16-year-old half-human/half-cow youth (which technically would make him a half-bull, he being a male). Often bullied and isolated as a child due to his cow heritage, until he met Leo and formed a fast friendship with him, which endured all the way until the time the story takes place. While being depicted as lazy delinquent who is a bit lecherous, reckless and a drug user (the titular fire candy), he becomes a brutal savage while brawling, drawing insane pleasure by mauling whoever he has under his fists at the given time. He was deeply in love with Akito, and her death shook him tremendously, to the point of him deluding himself or succumbing to even greater brawling-induced madness. He founded the Jammy Angels gang with his friends as a way to impose themselves, easily find more drugs or commit other acts of delinquency. Just at the end of the manga, he gave in to his barbaric urges when he mauled to death and beheaded one of Lloyd's henchmen with his bare hands. Leo: A heavily-tanned, golden-haired half lion, Leo is Ryoki's best friend. Like him, Leo was often picked on as a child, but contrary to Ryoki he brutally fought back, and was also the first one to inspire Ryoki not to back down against abuse, but instead fight back to defend himself. This very speech started haunting him years later when Leo witnessed how brutal Ryoki became while fighting, to the point of becoming frightened of him. He himself shows off as cool and aloof, but heavily supports the fact that he himself is not a savage beast, a resolution that started to crack when he beat to death a fellow juvenile. Akito: Part of Ryoki's group. For a brief time she is presented as the main female lead, Yukito's twin sister and also Ryoki's lover - who is often her ire's object when he gropes her bust. Hitting puberty and learning what feelings and carnal pleasure were, she and Ryoki shared a night of passionate sex, after which she succumbed to the brutal after-effects of Fire Candy, burning from the inside- out and melting into a putrid mass of blood and flesh. Her death served as the main catalyst to fuel Ryoki's savagery and madness to an even greater extent. Yukito: Akito's twin sister, different only due to her longer hair and the fact that she wore a number of piercing on her ears. She boasted a proud and rebellious personality, though this was just a farce to conceal her huge crush for Ryoki, which was never reciprocated. On one of their encounters, he even mistook her for her dead sister Akito. She was kidnapped and almost gang-raped by Lloyd's henchmen, but was rescued in time by Ryoki and his friends. Haru/Haruki: Haruki, or Haru for short, is an extremely feminine-looking male prostitute and one-quarter lynx, notable due to his platinum hair that once earned him the nickname of Platinum Lynx. The oldest of Ryoki's acquaintances at 24 years old (though he looks much younger). Ten years before the beginning of the story, he was part of a fearsome gang of juveniles known as Platinum, enjoying a lifestyle of savage brawling. He was a good friend of Lloyd, Platinum's leader, though some facts (left unknown) led the two to separate ways. Sometimes after that he came to know a girl who became his lover and bore him a child, though the two were assaulted by Tetsuya and his thugs, which gang-raped both Haru and his girlfriend after forcing her to give birth, while filming the whole assault as amateur pornography. Though often used as a comic relief, Haru is even more of a monster while fighting than Ryoki, and appears to be something of a twisted sadist, getting sexually aroused by seeing Ryoki fight, or when he himself mauls others. Miyuki: The only complete human of Ryoki's group, a four-eyed juvenile which is often left behind during brawls. As a statement to the fact that he is fully human, he still has parents. Lloyd: The main antagonist of the story. Ten years earlier, he was the leader of the feared Platinum, and a friend of both Tetsuya and Haruki, especially the latter. However, something in the past disbanded the group and led Lloyd to become a powerful criminal lord of the underworld. He is the main distributor of the drug, Fire Candy, and is also the one who sent Tetsuya and his henchmen to brutalize Haruki and his girlfriend when they were together. In the story, he never took active part in anything that involved the main characters, but he became the main focus of their rage, beginning with the raise in Fire Candy's prices, which brought Ryoki to found Jammy Angels, to steal more of the drug. Tetsuya: Often shortened as Tetsu, Tetsuya is one of Lloyd's primary henchmen. Often a laid-back individual, he is a sick and twisted sadist, and the one primarily responsible in raping both Haruki and his wife. A very capable fighter, he was part of Platinum before the gang was disbanded, and ended up being used by Lloyd as a thug. He was the one who kidnapped Yukito, and almost raped her before Ryoki came and fought with him. Confident of winning, Tetsuya stabbed him with a knife, only to have Ryoki assault him and slit his throat, after which he was beheaded by Ryoki's bare hands.

He received his initial art training in the early 1970s at the Cooper School of Art, Cleveland, Ohio.  Career  Paternite began his professional art career in 1973. Since that time, he has exhibited artwork in over 185 group exhibitions and 21 solo exhibitions throughout the world. Notable exhibits include the 2010 infrared photography centennial hosted by the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain. In 1973, Paternite published two limited edition portfolios of serigraphic prints, entitled \\"Six Clouds\\" volume 1 and volume 2. In 1974, he was the recipient of an \\"Artists Fellowship Award\\" (sculpture) from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), Washington, D.C. In 1980, Paternite published \\"The Infrared Portfolio\\" a limited-edition portfolio of 10 original black-and-white infrared photographs, with an introduction by Robert M. Doty. In 1981, Paternite published \\"Below The Visible Spectrum\\" a limited-edition portfolio of 10 original black-and-white infrared photographs, with introductions by Nicholas C. Hlobeczy and Joe LaRose. In 1982, he co-edited and published the \\"American Infrared Survey\\" this book, (the first of its kind) explored artistic trends in black-and-white & color infrared photography. Over 300 photographers from across the United States participated in this project, which not only resulted in the publication of the book, but also a travelling exhibition of original infrared photographs. The \\"American Infrared Survey\\" traveling exhibition toured the following venues: *The Florida Institute of Technology, Jensen Beach, Florida, in 1983 *The County College of Morris, Morris, New Jersey, in 1984 *The Vivian Esders Gallery, Paris, France, in 1984 *Images Gallery, Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1986 In 1988, Paternite was awarded an \\"Individual Artists Fellowship\\" (sculpture) from the Ohio Arts Council (OAC), Columbus, Ohio  Media  In 1994, he co-produced a VHS video entitled \\"Creature-Nites of Ohio\\" ~ This bizarrely highlighted the life and times of 10 species of hybrid animals created by Paternite in 1989. (approximate running time: 11 minutes). Stephen Paternite has been creating art with dead creatures for over sixteen years, probably longer. As well, he has created a video called \\"Creature Nites‚Äù which is a docu-drama of non-existent creatures. In 2003, Paternite (self) produced a DVD, entitled \\"Too Gross For Discovery\\" ~ This DVD is the original (rough-cut) episode of \\"Dirty Jobs\\" with host Mike Rowe. The episode from 2003, which featured the roadkill artwork of Stephen Paternite, was ultimately rejected by the network for being \\"too gross\\" for broadcast. (approximate running time: 17 minutes) ...... In 2004, Paternite published a limited-edition lithographic art print illustrating 7 mixed-media animal sculptures he created between 2002 & 2004\\\\. Since he began his art career in 1970, Stephen Paternite has exhibited his artwork in over 130 group exhibitions, and has mounted 16 one-person shows throughout the United States and South America. Controversy In 1989, Paternite became embroiled in a controversy regarding some of his (government-funded) mixed media taxidermy sculptures.

In the accident, 32 people died and 45 were injured. Accident The accident occurred on the afternoon of Monday, 2 May 1994. After a twenty-minute scheduled stop at a depot in Zawory, the bus - an Autosan H9-21 - began its return to Gda≈Ñsk with just two passengers. However, at the next scheduled stop in Chmielenek, several more people boarded the bus. Further along the route, large crowds of travelers boarded the vehicle at stops in Chmielno and in Kartuzy. At ≈ªukowo, the driver acquiesced to the request of some travelers to make a stop. Finally, when the bus stopped in Le≈∫no, an additional eight people boarded. By this time, the overcrowded vehicle was carrying 74 passengers, far in excess of the maximum allowable capacity of 51 (39 sitting, 12 standing). Site of the accident, marked by a cross 32 kilometers after the start of its journey and 500 meters before its next scheduled stop in Gda≈Ñsk- Kokoszki, the overloaded bus veered off the road and crashed into a tree while attempting to pass a Jelcz truck. The force of the impact drove the tree 4,2 meters into the body of the bus. In the collision, 25 passengers died immediately, with five passengers dying shortly after while being transported to local hospitals (two of them before reached hospitals.) Two additional victims died five and six days after crash, respectively, while the driver, Jerzy Marczy≈Ñski, survived. Cause of accident The court case was closed in 1999, after a one and a half year inquiry into the accident. The immediate cause of the accident was found to be the explosion of the right front tire, with contributing causes given as: * Overcrowding on the bus (77 passengers instead of 51) * The excessive speed of the bus during the accident sequence (60 km/hour instead of 50 km/hour) * The generally poor condition of the 11-year-old bus The tree which the bus struck was cut down in February 2008.

The majority of recycling undertaken in the United Kingdom is done by statutory authorities, although commercial and industrial waste is chiefly processed by private companies. Local Authorities are responsible for the collection of municipal waste and operate contracts which are usually kerbside collection schemes. The Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 required local authorities in England to provide every household with a separate collection of at least two types of recyclable materials by 2010. Recycling policy is devolved to the administrations of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales who set their own targets, but all statistics are reported to Eurostat. Alt URL Incentives Local Authorities are given incentives towards meeting recycling targets set by European, national and regional Government by the imposition of financial penalties for failing to recycle. For example, levies are imposed on the proportion of waste material going to landfill under a landfill tax, which currently stands at ¬£94.15 per tonne. Unlike other European countries, there are very few deposit-refund schemes in operation. The Defra Packaging Strategy of 2009 supported reward-based programmes, but other than some trials in Scotland, they have received almost no public or political attention. This may be due to the lack of evidence that they improve the recycling rate in a UK context. In December 2018, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (DEFRA) has announced plans for a pledge of up to ¬£60m towards innovative new packaging. One initiative in this is to assess the viability of household food waste being \\"transformed into environmentally-friendly plastic bags and cups.\\" The establishment of the government body Waste & Resources Action Programme has increased the country's recycling capacity. It is a registered charity. It works with businesses, individuals and communities to achieve a circular economy through helping them reduce waste, develop sustainable products and use resources in an efficient way. WRAP was established in 2000 as a company limited by guarantee. and receives funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Northern Ireland Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, the Welsh Government and the European Union.  Household recycling  thumbrightDistricts of England by household recycling rate 2016‚Äì17. UK domestic recycling policy is geared towards encouraging individuals to recycle in their own homes, through regulation and public awareness campaigns. These include fines for people who don't cut their household waste and a greater emphasis on separating waste into different recyclable materials, with each council applying different rules. Their focus is shifting toward encouraging recycling, rather than punishing households for non-recycled waste. Recycling is most efficient when items are reused around the home rather than discarded. Other approaches include taking glass items to bottle banks at supermarkets and composting biodegradable waste, making landfill unnecessary. According to the latest figures from Defra: * 44.3% of household waste was recycled in 2015 * There was a 235% increase in household recycling in England between 2000/01 and 2009/10.Household Recycling Rate Defra * 26.7 million tonnes of household waste was generated in 2015, of which ~11.6 million tonnes was recycled, reused or composted.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/607416/Digest_of_Waste_and_Resource_Statistics__2017_rev.pdf * In 2015, dry recycling was the largest component of recycled waste, comprising 59% of the total. A 2018 survey by the Ball Corporation studied the publics concerns and thoughts on recycling in the UK: * 86% of all British adults claim to be worried about the matter, and 90% of the people aged 55 and above show the most concern. * Despite this, only 67% claim to 'often' take action to reduce plastic pollution, for example by recycling and changing shopping habits to buy alternatives to disposable plastic.  Industrial recycling  Commercial and industrial (C&I;) waste makes up a large proportion of the UK's waste. According to DEFRA, 48 million tonnes of C&I; waste was generated in England in 2009, down from 67.9 million tonnes 6 years earlier. Furthermore, 52% of C&I; waste was reused or recycled, compared to just 42% in 2002/03. This figure is also greater than the household recycling rate. The industrial and service sectors generate roughly equal amounts of waste with similar recycling rates, even though the service sector is economically larger. The reporting of C&I; waste statistics has not always met the European Commission's standards, with local councils using different methodologies for their statistics. There has also been no comprehensive survey of C&I; waste since 2003.  The European Union  The EU has introduced a number of directives which determine the targets of UK domestic recycling policy: The 1999 Landfill Directive is one of the most important of these, which demands a reduction in the amount of waste being sent to landfill from 11.2 million tonnes in 2010 to 7.46 million tonnes in 2013 Landfill Waste in 2010 Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste Landfill Waste in 2013 The EU‚Äôs new Waste Framework Directive In 2010, Defra claimed that the UK would meet its first landfill diversion target, which was 75% on 1995 levels, and that it is ‚Äòon track‚Äô to meet the next targets in 2013 (50% on 1995 levels) and 2020 (35% on 1995 levels).Defra landfill diversion targets Defra The EU Waste Framework Directive states that the UK must recycle 50% of household waste by 2020, which includes composting and reusing waste. It also stipulates a 70% minimum recycling target for construction and demolition waste by 2020.UK Framework Directive on Household Recycling Defra The British government is highly confident in meeting the 2020 recycling target, but there is a lower level of certainty with the 2020 Landfill Directive target. There may not be enough time to construct the necessary facilities for organic waste.  Main aspects of UK recycling policy  Public recycling bins for paper, cans, and plastics in Newcastle upon Tyne. UK recycling policy aims to improve recycling methods and levels across the UK, focusing on glass, paper, plastic and metal cans. = Glass = Glass can be recycled in the form of bottles and jars which are crushed down and then melted. Glass can be recycled infinitely because it does not lose any of its quality. It uses a lot less energy, fewer raw materials and produces less CO2 than manufacturing glass from scratch. The main difficulty with recycling glass is the need to remove the unwanted materials that contaminate it and avoiding the mixing of different colours. Glass collection points, known as Bottle Banks are very common near shopping centres, at civic amenity sites and in local neighborhoods in the United Kingdom. Bottle Banks commonly stand beside collection points for other recyclable waste like paper, metals and plastics. Local, municipal waste collectors usually have one central point for all types of waste in which large glass containers are located. There are now over 50,000 bottle banks in the United Kingdom, and 752,000 tons of glass are now recycled annually. The waste recycling industry in the UK cannot consume all of the recycled container glass that will become available over the coming years, mainly due to the colour imbalance between that which is manufactured and that which is consumed. The UK imports much more green glass in the form of Wine bottles than it uses, leading to a surplus amount for recycling. The resulting surplus of green glass from imported bottles may be exported to producing countries, or used locally in the growing diversity of secondary end uses for recycled glass.British Standards Institute (2005) PAS 102, Specification for processed glass for selected secondary end markets = Paper = All types of waste paper are recyclable, and recycled paper requires a lot less energy and fewer raw materials to produce than manufacturing it from scratch. However, paper cannot be recycled indefinitely, and the normal number of times it can be recycled is about six.Paper Recycling Information UK Government Recycling Guideline 12.5 million tonnes of paper and cardboard are used annually in England. = Plastic = In the UK, the amount of post- consumer plastic being recycled is relatively low,Plastics wasteonline.org.uk. Retrieved 18 October 2007. due in part to a lack of recycling facilities. The challenge with recycling plastic lies in sorting differing types of plastic, often by hand, which slows the process. The Plastics 2020 Challenge was founded in 2009 by the plastics industry with the aim of engaging the British public in a nationwide debate about the use, reuse and disposal of plastics, and hosts a series of debates on its website framed around the waste hierarchy. = Metal cans = There is a high recycling rate for metal cans in the UK, with aluminium recycling and steel cans being the most common items. Metal can be recycled indefinitely, and aluminium cans use just 5% of the energy needed to produce them from scratch and only release 5% of the amount of greenhouse gases. In addition, it is the easiest material to extract and separate from the other recyclables, using magnets for steel cans and special magnets (eddy currents) it guarantees recycling of every can. = Other materials =  Cartons  In 2013, the Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment and Sonoco Alcore opened the UK's first carton recycling facility in Halifax. Prior to this, recycling was limited because of the high shipping costs for export, but the new plant processes 40 percent of the country's carton waste. Problems also arise because cartons cannot use recycled fibre, so they are converted into cardboard instead.  Electronics  The European Union implemented the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive, 2002/96/EC) in February 2003. It requires manufacturers to shoulder the burden of recycling by reimbursing the recyclers' costs. It also set a minimum quota of 4 kg per capita of e-waste per head by 2009. The United Kingdom was the final member state to pass it into law. The success of the WEEE directive has varied significantly from state to state, with collection rates varying between 13 kilograms per capita per annum to as little as 1 kg per capita per annum. Computers & electronic wastes collected from households within Europe are treated under the WEEE directive via Producer Compliance Schemes (whereby manufacturers of Electronics pay into a scheme that funds its recovery from household waste recycling centres (HWRCs)) and nominated Waste Treatment Facilities (known as Obligated WEEE). However, recycling of ex corporate Computer Hardware and associated electronic equipment falls outside the Producer Compliance Scheme (Known as non-obligated). In the UK, Waste or obsolete corporate related computer hardware is treated via third party Authorized Treatment Facilities, who normally impose a charge for its collection and treatment.  Local councils and recycling  Although recycling is required right across the UK, recycling rules differ depending on the local council. Some local councils have implemented a one-box system for separating household waste, whereas others have provided many more boxes, and this recyclable waste is often collected at different times from standard landfill waste collections. There are also different schemes in place across the country to determine where the waste goes and how it is used. In England, the local authorities are given targets by Defra. It is these local targets which help the government to achieve its national targets. However, local authorities are given flexibility in deciding how to best meet these targets, hence the number of different schemes in place. = London = The issue of waste management and recycling is acute in London - the capital produces 17 million tonnes of waste each year, forecast to rise to 26.5 million tonnes in 2020.The London Plan, Mayor of London, (February 2004), p158. The Mayor's Greater London Authority sets the framework for dealing with waste within a London-wide Municipal Waste Management Strategy including recycling targets for the London Boroughs to meet, which are made statutory within the London Plan. The existing organisational arrangements however are complex with a number of waste disposal authorities at sub-regional and local levels. =Birmingham = Birmingham City Council have introduced three kerbside collection schemes. # Paper & Card Recycling (Blue Bag/Box). Introduced 2003. Container emptied every 2 weeks. # Plastic Bottles (PET & HDPE), Glass, Aluminium & Tins Recycling (Green Box). Introduced 2005. Container emptied every 2 weeks. # Garden Waste Recycling (Green Sacks). Introduced 2005. In 2014, Birmingham City Council introduced a ¬£35 a year charge to have a garden waste wheelie bin, which caused huge numbers of complaints These three schemes are now available to most of Birmingham's homes depending on whether they have a garden. The Paper & Garden Waste recycling facility is available to all houses in Birmingham. The Green Box scheme is going to be available to all houses later this year. Every year 3500 tonnes of paper and 8900 tonnes of wood are recycled. There are five household recycling centres and over 400 recycling banks across the whole of Birmingham. Recycling banks normally include: * Paper & Card Recycling * Glass Recycling * Clothes Recycling * Shoes Recycling * Textiles Recycling * Aluminium Cans Recycling =Newcastle-under-Lyme= Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council now has a six bin collection scheme. * Food caddy for food waste. Collected weekly. * Red box for metal and plastic. Collected weekly. * Green box for glass and cardboard. Collected weekly. * Blue box for paper, small appliances, batteries, textiles and clothing. Collected weekly. * Brown-lid 240L wheelie bin for garden waste. Collected fortnightly, alternately with non-recyclables. * Black-lid 180L wheelie bin for non-recyclables. Collected fortnightly, alternately with garden waste. There has been criticism from residents of Newcastle-under-Lyme after the council spent ¬£2.4 million to improve its recycling in the borough, however the fleet of new vehicles are too wide to fit down some narrow roads. This has left some residents going for up to a fortnight without any waste collection service.  Criticisms  There have been a number of controversies in recent years involving the recycling policies of various local councils: = Multiple containers = One of the major problems for recycling at home has been the provision of multiple containers to sort the waste. This has been criticised for being too confusing for many residents, with one of the biggest offenders being the Newcastle-under-Lyme council which implemented a nine-bin system in 2010.Nine Bin Recycling System BBC News Other councils have provided up to seven bins, although some private contractors provide only one, and separate the recyclable material themselves.One Bin Recycling Initiative Waste Concern = Fortnightly collections = When fortnightly collections were brought in during 2007, they caused a lot of controversy. Many people were against them because it meant that they had to keep hold of their waste for longer and it was feared that this could be unhygienic, with fears arising in the press about health problems being caused as a result.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7501433/Fortnightly- collections-make-bins-a-health-hazard.html Telegraph Online However research conducted by Cranfield University and Enviros in 2007, found that there is unlikely to be significantly greater health issues relating to fortnightly collections against weekly. weeklyresearchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05988/SN05988.pd In January 2014 the Secretary Of State for Communities and Local Government outlined guidance for how weekly collections could be achieved by local authorities. This was supported by a ¬£250 million scheme made available to participating waste authorities.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271435/BinBible-2-NT3.pdf The Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM) questioned ‚Äúwhether the focus of the ¬£250 million fund will deliver the best environmental and economic outcomes‚Äù and suggested that the money could better be spent on alternative options. It went on: 'the additional money could more usefully have been focused on delivering improvements in three key areas: supporting more recycling, either by expanding the range of materials collected or improving participation; supporting an expansion in food waste collections, which is the main area of householder concern regarding collection frequency; and supporting waste prevention initiatives... In economic terms, with so many constraints on council budgets, it is important to ensure that this policy initiative does not lock local councils into significantly higher waste collection costs, for which we will all have to foot the bill long after the Weekly Collections Support Scheme funding has run dry'.CIWM responds to CLG announcement on funding for weekly collections, Chartered Institution of Wastes Management, 30 September 2011  See also  *British Metals Recycling Association *Waste Disposal Authorities in Greater London *Recycling in Northern Ireland  References   Further reading  *  External links  *Waste and recycling page at DEFRA * Recycling Policy Document * Recycling Guide *Recycling at the Birmingham City Council ","title":"Recycling in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"11866371","text":"The Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB) was a South African theatre organisation based in Cape Town, serving the former Cape Province. It was one of the four state-funded performing arts councils in the four former provinces of South Africa instituted in 1963.  History  In 1961, the National Theatre Organisation was disbanded and replaced by four provincial performing arts councils. In Cape Town, the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB) was instituted in 1962 with the aim to promote the performing arts in the Cape Province and South Arica. The arts councils received sufficient government subsidies to fund various art forms as well as the operational requirements of the theatre facilities. Staff could be taken into permanent employment.  Demise  Since 1994, government policy changed dramatically. All performing arts boards were transformed to managers of playhouses and the various arts companies had to become independent. The CAPAB Drama Department staged its last production in May 1997 with a final performance of David Mowat's The Guise, a play which has the survival of the theatre as its theme. The new organisation, Artscape, was launched on 27 March 1999 to replace CAPAB and the Nico Malan Theatre Complex was renamed the Artscape Theatre Centre.  Theatres and other facilities   Nico Malan Theatre Centre  The Nico Malan Theatre Centre was opened on 19 May 1971, to be programmed and managed by Cape Performing Arts Board as a production house with four arts companies ‚Äì orchestra, opera, ballet and drama. These companies had full-time artistes, technical and administrative staff. In line with the new South African the political dispensation and the concurrent changes, the complex was renamed the Artscape Theatre Centre in March 2001.  Port Elizabeth Opera House   Maynardville Open-air Theatre  =to be added (please help edit this article)= CAPE PERFORMING ARTS BOARD (CAPAB) (Afrikaans: Kaaplandse Raad vir die Uitvoerende Kunste ‚Äì KRUIK). Founded in 1963, after the dissolving of the National Theatre Organisation, with Danie van Eeden*?? as its first director. (He was followed consecutively by G√© Korsten, George Loopuyt and Michael Maas.) Registered as a society not for gain, it was headed by a policy-making council chaired by the provincial administrator and representative of all interested parties, including the province, the city municipality of Cape Town, the department of national education, the business sector as well as representatives of the various performing art forms. Their function was to provide artists and artisans with a secure career option, to develop and promote drama, ballet, music and opera by offering audiences in the province with regular professional productions. Its first productions were Becket (Anouilh) and Hedda Gabler (Ibsen, in Afrikaans) in the Hofmeyr Theatre in November 1963. Their first opera (The Bartered Bride by Smetana) was done on 8 February 1965 in the Alhambra Theatre. Their first indigenous in play Afrikaans was *** in 196*, while the first indigenous English play was The Year of the Locust by James Ambrose Brown (1966). Initially renting theatres in the various cities, CAPAB purchased the Opera House in Port Elizabeth in 1967, and refurbished it for use as a base for their work in the Eastern Cape. In 1971 they opened the Nico Malan Theatre Complex in Cape Town, The Opera House with a performance of the ballet Sylvia, and the Theatre with a controversial [Presidential] opening production, \\"KONING LEAR\\" [Uys Krige] - directed by Dieter Reible, [\\"Christine\\" - Barto Smit was also scheduled, but banned before rehearsals commenced due to subject matter]. Feydeau's \\"Hond Se Gedagte\\" [A Flea in her Ear'] also directed by Dieter Reible followed 'Lear'. The opening of this theatre \\"for whites only\\" ‚Äì despite the protests of artists, critics and many of the population ‚Äì was to be one of the most troublesome issues for the council over the next twenty years, as it was actively boycotted by the Cape non-white population as well as their supporters. It was belatedly opened for all on 21 February 1975, but this had little effect on the boycott, which lasted for many more years. In 1972 a third venue, the Arena, was builtin a large rehearsal room, to house the work of CAPAB;'s experimental company [Aubrey berg's production of Hofmann's \\"The Burgomaster\\"]. The first head of drama was the long serving Pieter Fourie, followed by Johan Esterhuizen in 19**, and later by***. CAPAB also had a very successful youth company, founded to do educational work and originally led by Robin Malan*? Followed over the years by i.a. Eileen Thorns, ** and Ivan Abrahams and. . the CAPAB:Cape Provincial Arts Board. . Together with PACT and the Phoenix Players, they staged Athol Fugard's Boesman and Lena and People are Living There, both directed by Fugard and starring Yvonne Bryceland and Glyn Day in 1970. Peter Curtis and Pieter Fourie ran this drama company circa 1971. They staged their plays at the old Hofmeyr Theatre. They acquired their own theatre and opera house in 1971 in the form of the Nico Malan. The Nico's first performance in front of an integrated audience, the Academy Theatres‚Äô Who Saw Him Die took place on 21 February 1975. Their production of Dalene Matthee's Fiela se Kind starring Shaleen Surtie-Richards was staged at the Nico Malan in 1986. Basil Rubin in association with CAPAB staged William Luce's Zelda at the Adcock-Ingram in August 1987. Together with Volute Productions they staged Robert Hewett's Gulls which Keith Grenville directed in 1987. Together with the other three performing arts councils they staged The Great Walt for their Christmas production in 1987 and Singin‚Äô in the Rain for their Christmas production in 1988. They staged My Fair Lady in 1989/90. They presented Michael Drinn's The Phantom of the Opera in 1990. Together with PACT, the Johannesburg Civic Theatre Association and NAPAC they presented A Chorus Line in 1992. Together with NAPAC and PACOFS they presented Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! in 1993. **** (Tucker, 1997) CAPE PERFORMING ARTS BOARD (CAPAB) (****-****). Cape Town.

It is a form of cooperative multitasking, in which there is only one task. The sole task is typically realized as an infinite loop in main(), e.g. in C. The basic scheme is to cycle through a repeating sequence of activities, at a set frequency (AKA time-triggered cyclic executive). For example, consider the example of an embedded system designed to monitor a temperature sensor and update an LCD display. The LCD may need to be written twenty times a second (i.e., every 50 ms). If the temperature sensor must be read every 100 ms for other reasons, we might construct a loop of the following appearance: int main(void) { while (1) { // This loop is designed to take 100 ms, meaning // all steps add up to 100 ms. // Since this is demo code and we don't know how long // tempRead or lcdWrite take to execute, we assume // they take zero time. // As a result, the delays are responsible for the task scheduling / timing. // Read temp once per cycle (every 100 ms) currTemp = tempRead(); // Write to LCD twice per cycle (every 50 ms) lcdWrite(currTemp); delay(50); lcdWrite(currTemp); delay(50); // Now 100 ms (delay(50) + delay(50) + tempRead + lcdWrite + lcdWrite) // has passed so we repeat the cycle. } } The outer 100 ms cycle is called the major cycle. In this case, there is also an inner minor cycle of 50 ms. In this first example the outer versus inner cycles aren't obvious. We can use a counting mechanism to clarify the major and minor cycles. int main(void) { int i  0; while (1) { // This loop is designed to take 50 ms. // Since this is demo code and we don't know how long // tempRead or lcdWrite take to execute, we assume // they take zero time. // Since we only want tempRead to execute every 100ms, we use // an if statement to check whether a counter is odd or even, // and decide whether to execute tempRead. // Read temp every other cycle (every 100 ms) if ( (i%2)  0) { currTemp = tempRead(); } // Write to LCD once per cycle (every 50 ms) lcdWrite(currTemp); delay(50); i++; // Now 50 ms has passed so we repeat the cycle. } }  See also  * Arduino - a popular example of this paradigm * Event loop * Preemption (computing) References Category:Operating system technology Category:Concurrent computing ","title":"Cyclic executive"},{"id":"11866409","text":"The Jonga was a Nissan designed vehicle formerly used by the Indian Army.

History The Indian Army showed an interest at the Nissan Patrol P60 and the Nissan 4W73 in the 1960s. A decision was made to prioritize the eventual production of the jeeps in the aftermath of the Sino- Indian War.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/4561/1/pac_6_109_1979.pdf The factory manufacturing the Jonga was commissioned for a cost of Rs. 32.06 crores by November 1965. The costs were revised again twice; firstly, on December 1970 for Rs. 41.53 crores and again in January 1973 for Rs. 46.84 crores. The first Jongas made by VFJ were produced in 1969 for military use. A civilian variant of the Jonga was later made in 1996. In 1999, the production of the Jonga stopped with 100 of them sold to civilians. In 2013, it was reported that 20,000 Jongas were still in service with the Indian military. It also has reported sales of 2,000 Jongas to the state governments of Kerala, and Jammu and Kashmir. Design As the Jonga's design was based on the Nissan P60 and 4W73, it made maintenance easy due to access to COTS parts. In 1996, the VFJ introduced the new 3.0L Hino diesel engine for civilian versions, which was sourced with assistance from Ashok Leyland. It was known for its high ground clearance at 222 mm, its power at 3,800 rpm and peak torque at 1,800 rpm.\\"The Jonga and its cult following\\", Business Standard, August 25, 2018. The Jonga was originally made for 6 people before changes were made to allow seating capacity for up to 8 people. In 2014, it was reported that the Advanced Material and Process Research Centre (AMPRI) was working on an aluminum-based composite material, which was used to develop a brake drum from a combination of metal, ceramic and aluminum, and for other automobile components; this was produced in partnership with the Vehicle Research and Development Establishment (VRDE). According to AMPRI, the item was tested by VFJ on a Jonga, which reported an increase in braking efficiency. Variants The Jonga was known to be used as a general purpose vehicle, ambulance, gun carrier for recoilless rifles, recon and patrol vehicle. Criticism There were reports that the Jonga's wheel bearings were prone to falling off according to a Border Roads Organisation report. VFJ teams sent to inspect the damaged vehicles concluded that maintenance teams had not complied with the necessary procedures in conducting repairs and maintenance.

The objective of The Pit is to descend into an underground labyrinth, retrieve a gem, and escape. A game similar to The Pit, programmed by Chris Gray, inspired Peter Liepa to create Boulder Dash.Arno Eduard Weber, Interview with Peter Liepa, October/November 2005, published on boulder-dash.nl, cit. The publisher put me in touch with Chris Gray, who had submitted a game in Basic, but didn't at the time have the skills to convert it into machine language... The game was similar to an arcade game called The Pit, but after examining it more I didn't think the game had any 'legs' ‚Äì too much of it was predetermined. But I started playing with basic elements of dirt, rocks, and jewels and within a couple of days had built the basic \\"physics engine\\" of what was to become Boulder Dash.  Gameplay  Arcade screenshot The player's avatar (described as \\"The Astronaut-Explorer\\" by the game manual) lands in a spaceship and must dig his way into a series of tunnels. While there, he must avoid being crushed by rocks, eaten by monsters, impaled by arrows, or melted in a vat of acid. In lieu of a traditional timer is a tank (the \\"Zonker\\") shooting away a mountain near the player's spaceship. If the player dallies too long in the maze, the Zonker will destroy the player's spaceship, and the player loses a life. After collecting the treasure, the only route back to the spaceship is by crossing \\"The Pit\\", which is a room with a sliding retractable floor underneath which is a monster that will devour a player who tarries too long. = Scoring = The player receives 200 points for shooting each enemy, 1000 points for each crystal collected, 2000 points for collecting buried treasure, and 1000 points for crossing \\"The Pit\\" safely and reboarding the ship.  Ports  The tank is labeled \\"Zilec\\" in the U.K. version, and \\"Taito\\" in the Japanese version. In addition, the game map layout as well as the color palette differ between the regional versions. The game was ported from the original 6502 (Tangerine) processor board to Centuri's Z80 board in 1982. A port for the Commodore 64 was released in 1983 and one for the VIC-20 in 1984.

Theory of European Rationalism  Aida is best remembered for the theory that the \\"rationality\\" of Western civilization was consequential upon the practice of raising and killing livestock. This hypothesis, called the ,Alternatively the kachiku shiy≈çsetsu ) was set forth in his 1966 book Rationalism (G≈çrishugi). He associated the slaughter of domestic animals, which had been hitherto reared with great care, with the nonchalant belligerence of Western soldiers. In his view, Westerners are free from the kind of hysteria Japanese soldiers would often show at the sight of bloodshed. Aida blamed this hysteria for the excessive acts of cruelty that the Japanese were accused of during the Second World War. Westerners, on the other hand, have so long been accustomed to calmly butchering animals that they developed a rational approach to slaughter, which they extended to human conflict. The Japanese hardly had any contact with livestock owing to the Buddhist taboo of eating meat and were too emotive to master the Western sort of nonchalance.

She married Archduke Joseph of Austria, Palatine (Governor) of Hungary. Her marriage was the only Romanov-Habsburg marital alliance that ever occurred. Birth Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna was born in Tsarskoye Selo as the third child and eldest daughter of Tsar Paul I of Russia and his second wife Sophie Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg (renamed Maria Feodorovna after her wedding). The sex of the child disappointed her paternal grandmother, Empress Catherine II. She wrote: The Empress' secretary Alexander Khrapovitsky wrote that the Empress considered the newborn Grand Duchess Alexandra very ugly, especially compared with her older brothers.Evgeny Karnovich: Alexandra Pavlovna in: Remarkable and enigmatic personalities of the 17th and 19th centuries, ed. A.S. Suvorin 1884, pp. 305‚Äì376 - 520 p. The comparison with her younger sister Elena, was also unfavorable to her: the Empress noted that the six-month-old Elena was much smarter and more charming than the two-year Alexandra. However, as a gift for the birth of Alexandra, Catherine II gave her son Gatchina Palace. Gradually the Empress started to have better feelings about her granddaughter. On 12 March 1787 she wrote to her: In turn, Alexandra was particularly attached to her grandmother. Catherine II noted: Education Grand Duchesses Alexandra and Elena Pavlovna, by Elisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun, ca. 1795-1797. She received the usual education of Russian princesses and was taught French and German as well as music and drawing. Alexandra was very close to her younger sister Elena, and they were often painted together. Alexandra's upbringing, as well as her sisters, was entrusted to Charlotte von Lieven, who acted as Governess. A little Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna dressed in kokoshnik and sarafan, 1790s. The older Grand Duchess was a very diligent student. In 1787, her mother proudly wrote about her four-year-old daughter, that \\"she continues to be diligent, making notable advances and begins to translate from German\\". Alexandra was fascinated by drawing and \\"I think she has a great talent in this art\\", and the music and singing, and \\"in these arts has found remarkable abilities\\". In 1790, in her letter to the Baron von Grimm, Catherine II gave a description of her granddaughter: Gustav IV In 1794, the Empress began to think about the future of the Grand Duchess. Alexandra Pavlovna was eleven years old, and \\"that summer a girl should be considered an adult.\\" In the letters of those years Catherine II expresses the idea of bringing to Russia \\"landless princes\\", who after marrying her granddaughters would get the position and means for life in their new homeland. But the fate of Alexandra turned out differently. In 1792, news arrived at the Russian court regarding the murder of King Gustav III of Sweden (who was the Empress' first-cousin) and the accession to the throne of his 14 year old son Gustav IV Adolf. Reportedly, the desire of the late Swedish monarch was to make an alliance with the Russian Imperial family by marrying his only son to one of the granddaughters of the Empress; however, according to another version, the idea of marriage belonged to the Empress, and even became one of the secret conditions of the Treaty of V√§r√§l√§. The idea of this alliance was supported by the Swedish regent, the new King's uncle Charles, Duke of S√∂dermanland. In October 1793, on the occasion of the marriage of the Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich with Princess Louise of Baden arrived in St. Petersburg Count Stenbock with congratulations from the Swedish court, and started the official talks about marriage. Alexandra began to learn the Swedish language, as well as to prepare to think about her future husband. Negotiations went with varying success. In January 1794, Catherine II wrote to her first-cousin, the Duke of S√∂dermanland: But on two issues the parties could not reach an agreement: The religion of the future Queen and the fate of Count Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, member of the conspiracy against the Swedish regent, who took refuge in Russia. In retaliation, the regent began to negotiate a marriage between Gustav IV Adolf and Duchess Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Pretending to ignore the machinations of the Swedish regent, the Empress wrote in April 1795 to Baron von Grimm: On 1 November 1795 the Swedish court officially announced the engagement between Gustav IV Adolf and Duchess Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and the official church prayer in Sweden the intended bride began to be mentioned. Catherine II stood to protect her granddaughter: But the Empress was not limited to just words: she refused to accept the ambassador who came with the message of the engagement's announcement. Count Alexander Suvorov was sent to the Swedish border for \\"exploring the castles\\", and in Stockholm Major General Count Andrei Budberg was instructed to prevent the marriage. While the Swedish court was waiting for the arrival of the bride, the King suddenly changed his mind and broke off the engagement. In April 1796, talks about the \\"Russian marriage\\" were resumed by Catherine II, who invited Gustav IV Adolf to visit her in St. Petersburg. Gustav IV Adolf and his uncle the Duke of S√∂dermanland arrived incognito under for a meeting with the bride. A series of brilliant parties were arranged in their honor. The Swedish sovereign and Alexandra fell in love at first sight. The passion of Gustav IV Adolf for the Grand Duchess was evident: he danced with her constantly and had intimate conversations with her. On 25 August 1796, Gustav IV Adolf asked the Empress for permission to marry the Grand Duchess. The negotiations with Sweden were led by Counts Platon Zubov and Arkady Morkov. However, they were concerned with the question of the faith of the future Queen. The procurator-general Alexander Samoylov wrote: Only on 2 September Gustav IV Adolf agreed that Alexandra would keep her Eastern Orthodox faith. Four days later, on 6 September, the Swedish embassy formally requested the hand of the Grand Duchess. The groom and the bride's father visited some military maneuvers, and poet Gavrila Derzhavin wrote a \\"Concert for the engagement of the King of Sweden with Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna\\". The official engagement was scheduled to take place on 11 September in the Throne Room of the Winter Palace. However, when Counts Zubov and Morkov were to sign the marriage contract in the morning of that day, they found that there was no article about the freedom of religion of the Grand Duchess, which was erased by order of the king. Despite the pleas of the Russian envoys, the King was firm that he would never give his people an Orthodox queen, and locked himself in his room. The Empress, her court and Alexandra, who was dressed as a bride, waited for him for more than four hours. Following the announcement of the final rejection of the king, the Empress had a small attack of apoplexy, and a grief-stricken Alexandra, in tears, locked herself in her room; the Swedish embassy declared that the engagement was canceled due to illness of the King. On 12 September Gustav IV Adolf was present at the ball on the occasion of the birthday of Grand Duchess Anna Feodorovna (born Princess Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld), wife of Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich, but he was given a cold reception. Alexandra wasn't present at the ball, and the Empress had spent a little more than 15 minutes there, citing illness. Although the engagement didn't take place, talks about a marriage continued for a while. On 22 September 1796 the Swedish King had left Russia, with the Empress warned his son: \\"They're just your sons and their wives, but your four daughters should all be ill with colds.\\" Catherine II died two months later, on 17 November, and the marriage negotiations were continued by Alexandra Pavlovna's father and new Emperor Paul I of Russia. But in spite of all attempts, the main issue, the religion of Grand Duchess, was not settled, and the marriage negotiations were finally stopped. Soon, the Imperial family suffered another blow. In October 1797 Gustav IV Adolf married Princess Frederica of Baden, a younger sister of Grand Duchess Elizabeth Alexeievna, Alexandra's sister-in-law. Empress Maria Feodorovna blamed both her daughter- in-law for intriguing in favor of her sister and her husband the Emperor for \\"allowing himself these sharp and biting antics against her daughter\\". Marriage In 1799, three years after her failed betrothal with the King of Sweden, another marital project originated for Alexandra. Previously in 1798, Dukes Ferdinand Augustus and Alexander Frederick of W√ºrttemberg who were the brothers of the Empress Maria Feodorovna, arrived in St. Petersburg to serve in the Russian army. They expressed the interest of Austria to join with Russia in a coalition against the rising power of the French Republic and Napoleon, and to cement this alliance, it was decided to arrange a marriage between Alexandra and Archduke Joseph of Austria, Palatine (Governor) of Hungary and a younger brother of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. Archduke Joseph personally came to Russia to see his bride.S√°ndor Domanovszky: J√≥zsef n√°dor √©lete, els≈ë r√©sz, Budapest, Hungary Historical Society 1944, p. 231. The meeting between them was successful. In mid-February 1799 the betrothal ball was held. Later, a marriage contract was signed in which Alexandra would be allowed to kept her Russian Orthodox faith. In October, Count Fyodor Rostopchin wrote: On 25 September 1799, a decree was published about the royal title of Alexandra. In Russia, she was referred to as \\"Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess the Archduchess of Austria\\" with the French prefix of \\"Palatine d'Hongrie\\". The wedding took place on 30 October 1799 at Gatchina Palace, one week after the wedding of her sister Elena. To celebrate both events, poet Gavrila Derzhavin wrote the ode \\"the wedding celebrations of 1799\\". On 21 November the couple went to Austria. Countess Varvara Golovina remembered that Alexandra was sad to leave Russia, and her father Emperor Paul I \\"constantly repeated, would not see her since her sacrifice.\\" In Vienna, Alexandra was given a cold reception. When she was presented to Emperor Francis II, she reminded him of his first wife Elisabeth of W√ºrttemberg, who was her maternal aunt; this caused the jealousy of Empress Maria Theresa, Francis II's second wife, who also was envious of Alexandra's beauty and fine jewelry. Imperial confessor Andrew Samborski wrote: Once, Alexandra turned up to a ball beautifully dressed, with magnificent jewellery. The Empress was incensed at being upstaged by the Archduchess, and ordered her to remove her jewellery, and also told her that she could no longer wear them. Heeding her instructions, Alexandra only decorated her hair with flowers when she attended a play some time later. The flowers highlighted her beauty, leading her to be applauded and being given a standing ovation, making Maria Theresa even more furious. Archduke Joseph could not protect his wife from these attacks. Furthermore, her Eastern Orthodox faith aroused the hostility of the Roman Catholic Austrian court, who urged her to convert. Death Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna, Archduchess of Austria and Palatina of Hungary, in Hungarian dress, ca. 1800. Due to his responsibilities as Palatine, after a short stay in the Imperial court Archduke Joseph and his wife moved to Hungary, where they settled in the Alcs√∫t Castle. On May 7, 1800, the composer Ludwig van Beethoven played in the presence of Archduke Joseph and his wife Alexandra at the Buda castle. This was part and main event of a week-long celebration organized by the Archduke in honor of his beautiful wife Alexandra. Soon Alexandra was expecting her first child. The pregnancy was hard, as she was tormented by bouts of nausea. The doctor, following the orders of Empress Maria Theresa, was \\"more skilled in intrigues than in medicine, and moreover, with rude manners\\"; in addition, the cook prepared meals that she could not eat. The childbirth, which lasted several hours, tormented Alexandra. Imperial confessor Andrew Samborski wrote: A daughter, Archduchess Alexandrine of Austria, was born on 8 March 1801, but died within hours. She was named after her mother. Upon learning of the death of her daughter, Alexandra Pavlovna said: On the eighth day after the birth, Alexandra was allowed to get up, but in the evening she developed puerperal fever, which finally caused her early death on 16 March 1801 aged 17. Hungarian historian S√°ndor Domanovszky related the event as follows: Her death occurred during the same week as her father's murder. Both were terrible blows for the Romanov family. Burial According to the Russian Orthodox tradition they had to celebrate masses over the corpse during six weeks, so the body of Alexandra was unburied during this time. After the specified time elapsed, on 12 May 12, the body of the Archduchess was placed in the crypt of the Capuchin monastery of V√≠ziv√°ros (now Main Street 20). Chapel of Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna in √úr√∂m, Pest. Because the Austrian court refused her burial in any Catholic cemetery, Alexandra's remains remained unburied at V√≠ziv√°ros monastery until 1803, when her widower built a mausoleum dedicated to her in √úr√∂m near Pest (following the late Archduchess' wishes) and after her definitive burial in this place, an Eastern Orthodox service was held in her memory. In 1809, during the invasion of Napoleon's troops, Archduke Joseph ordered that the coffin with his wife's remains must be placed in Buda Castle for precaution, with a special Orthodox chapel prepared for this purpose. Once the threat of war was over, Alexandra's coffin was returned to the √úr√∂m Mausoleum, which became a place of pilgrimage for the local Orthodox community. During the Vienna Congress, Alexander I and the Grand Duchesses Maria Pavlovna and Ekaterina Pavlovna visited the grave of their sister. Archduke Joseph remained a widower for several years, and only in 1815 remarried Princess Hermine of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym, who died two years later (1817) also after giving birth, this time fraternal twins who survived. In 1819 the Archduke contracted his third and last marriage with Duchess Maria Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg, who bore him five children, of whom three survived infancy. After the death of Archduke Joseph in 1847, his children inherited the √úr√∂m state, who even survived both World Wars. The chapel was sacked, the valuables taken away and the coffins were open, but the remains weren't profaned, so the clothing and jewelry remained intact. In 1945, due to the Collectivization in Hungary near the property some farmers were established until 1953, when in the Russian Orthodox Church took over the ownership of the site. In November 1977 the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, the National Institute of Chemistry of Justice and the Budapest History Museum archaeologist and anthropologist experts carried out detailed investigations in the √úr√∂m Mausoleum. On 26 April 1981 the √úr√∂m Mausoleum was invaded by thieves, who profaned Alexandra's remains and coffin which was completely looted, taking clothing and jewelry. After this event, on 13 May Alexandra's remains were transferred to the crypt of Buda Castle, which had not yet been restored since the 1970s after the plunder and destruction made also by thieves. Until 2004, the Archduchess rested along the children and wives of her widower. Thanks to a generous financial support from a Russian and also due to the tireless organizing work of Father Nikolai since St. Petersburg, as well as √úr√∂m citizens who wanted to respect Alexandra's wishes, on 11 September 2004 her remains were returned to √úr√∂m Mausoleum in a solemn ceremony held by Bishop Hilarion, head of the Hungarian Orthodox Church. In the ceremony were present members of the Habsburg and Romanov families, Cardinal P√©ter Erd≈ë and the leaders of the Orthodox Churches in Hungary. Valery Muszatov, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian state gave a copy of Alexandra's portrait to the √úr√∂m Mausoleum.

In 1620 he served at the brief-lived English settlement of Oyapoc in present-day Guyana of South America, which was abandoned the same year. The Dutch controlled most of the territory. Warner is noted for settling on Saint Kitts and establishing it in 1624 as the first English colony in the Caribbean. Early life and education Warner was born in Suffolk, England in 1580. He entered the army at an early age, which provided him with his main training. He later married and started a family with his wife, which included their son Philip. Thomas Warner had an Island Carib mistress on St. Kitts, and their son was called \\"Indian Warner\\". Indian Warner was killed in the Dominica Massacre. Military career Warner became a captain in James I's guards. In 1620 he accepted assignment to the colonies, and took his family with him to the Oyapoc Colony in 1620 in today's Guyana. He served as a captain under the command of Roger North. Tomas Painton, another captain in the colony, suggested that Warner should try to colonise one of the islands in the Lesser Antilles, which Painton thought had more favourable conditions. In 1623 Warner abandoned his Guiana post and set sail North through the archipelago. Oyapoc was soon abandoned by the English. St Kitts =Early settlement= After checking each island, Warner decided that Saint Kitts would be the best-suited site for an English colony. He noted its strategic central position ideal for expansion, friendly native population, fertile soil, abundant fresh water, and large salt deposits. He and his family landed on the island and made peace with the local Kalinago people, whose leader was Ouboutou Tegremante. They were part of the indigenous Carib people of the islands. Warner left his family on the island and returned to England to gather more men to officially establish a colony. He was supported by Ralph Merrifield, a merchant, who provided the capital, and the brothers John and Samuel Jeaffreson. The Jeaffresons agreed to bring a second vessel with settlers and supplies. Warner returned to St. Kitts on January 28, 1624, with the Hopewell and established the colony of Saint Christopher, the first English colony in the Caribbean. He established a port town at Old Road, downhill from Tegremante's capital village. Another name for St. Kitts is St.Christopher. =French arrival= In 1625, a French captain, Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc, arrived on the island. He had organized a fleet of colonists hoping to establish an island colony, after hearing about the success of the English on Saint Kitts, but his fleet was destroyed by a run-in with the Spanish Armada. Only his flagship and its passengers survived to reach St. Kitts. Feeling sorry for the French colonists, Warner allowed them to settle on the island. Saint Kitts was thus the site of the first French settlement in the Caribbean. They took the ruins of the town of Dieppe, which they rebuilt. Warner accepted the French to gain more Europeans on the island, as he thought the local Kalinago were becoming less enthusiastic about the newcomers. =Kalinago genocide= Warner's concerns proved accurate. As the European population on Saint Kitts continued to increase, Tegremante grew suspicious of the foreigners. In 1626, after a secret meeting with Kalinago heads from neighbouring Waitikubuli (Dominica) and Oualie, the natives decided to ambush the European settlements on the night of the next full moon. The plan was revealed to the Europeans by an Igneri woman named Barbe.Jean Baptiste Du Tertre, Histoire Generale des Antilles..., 2 vols. Paris: Jolly, 1667, I:5-6 She had recently been brought to St. Kitts as a slave-wife after the Kalinago raided an Arawak island. According to the French historian Jean Baptiste Du Tertre, she despised the Kalinago and had fallen in love with Warner. The English and French joined forces and attacked the Carib at night. The colonists killed between 100 and 120 Caribs in their beds that night, with only the most beautiful Carib women spared to serve as slaves.Du Tertre (1667), I:6 The French and English set about fortifying the island against the expected invasion of Carib from other islands. According to Du Tertre, in the ensuing battle, three to four thousand Caribs took up arms against the Europeans. He did not estimate the number of Caribs killed, but said the fallen Amerindians on the beach were piled high into a mound. The English and French suffered at least 100 casualties. Others report that at Bloody Point, which then was the site of the island's main Kalinago settlement, over 2,000 Kalinago men were massacred. Many had come from Waitikubuli, planning to attack the Europeans the next day. The Europeans dumped the dead into the river, at the site of the Kalinago place of worship. For weeks, blood flowed down the river, for which it was named Bloody River. The Europeans deported the remaining Kalinago to Waitikubuli. The early accounts were by Europeans and told from their point of view. Modern scientists and historians estimate that many of their claims were fraudulent or exaggerated in order to justify the killings. Ethnologists have put the events into a different context. The killings occurred in late January, near the middle of the dry season. The Kalinago called this the season of \\"Bat man\\", due to the abundance of the species then. Usually, they made raids on the Taino and other Amerindians at this time to take sacrifices to appease \\"Bat man,\\" to ensure the dry season ended and the wet season began. (This was called the season of \\"Frog woman\\".) Kalinago had gathered from various islands at St. Christopher at the time, because of its location: on the border between the islands controlled by different groups, it was used as a base for Kalinago raids against the Taino. Evidence of atrocity was that the Europeans killed so many and defiled the Kalinago place of worship, a means of frightening the Kalinago of neighbouring islands. After the Kalinago Genocide of 1626, the Europeans partitioned the island, with the French gaining the ends, Capisterre in the North and Basseterre in the south; and the British gaining the centre. Both groups colonised neighbouring islands from their bases. The English settled Nevis (1628), Antigua (1632), and Montserrat (1632). Warner was appointed as Governor of St. Kitts, Nevis, Barbados and Montserrat in 1625. The French colonised Martinique (1635), the Guadeloupe archipelago (1635), and St. Barths (1648). In 1643 Warner was appointed as Parliamentary Governor of the Caribee Islands. After his first wife died, he was said to have taken a Carib woman in a 'common-law marriage' and they had a lasting relationship. Warner died on March 10, 1649, in St. Kitts and was buried in a tomb in Middle Island. The Carib woman was reported to have given birth to many other children after Warner's death. Slave trade After the Kalinago Genocide of 1626 and the subsequent partitioning of the island, Warner imported many thousands of African slaves for labour. They were forced to develop and work on large sugar and tobacco plantations to raise commodity crops for export. As the years passed, Sir Thomas Warner amassed a wealth that would amount to over ¬£100 million in today's terms. He died on March 10, 1649 in St. Kitts, and he was buried in a tomb in Middle Island.

She pioneered multidisciplinary research of the prefrontal cortex and working memory. Early life and education Patricia Shoer was born in Salem, Massachusetts. Her father, Irving Shoer, was the son of Latvian immigrants and her mother, Jenny Pearl, was a Russian immigrant. She grew up in Peabody, Massachusetts and attended Peabody High School. Goldman-Rakic earned her bachelor's degree cum laude in neurobiology from Vassar in 1959, and her doctorate from the University of California at Los Angeles in experimental Developmental Psychology in 1963.\\"Patricia Goldman-Rakic\\", Newsmakers, Issue 4. Gale Group, 2002. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale. 2007. http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC After postdoctoral positions at UCLA and New York University, Goldman-Rakic worked at the National Institute of Mental Health in neuropsychology and later as Chief of Developmental Neurobiology from 1965-1979. She moved to Yale School of Medicine in 1979 where she remained until her death. She was The Eugene Higgins Professor of Neuroscience in the neurobiology department with joint appointments in the departments of psychiatry, neurology, and psychology. In 1988 she was granted a five-year, $6 million grant to establish the Center for Neuroscience Research at Yale.  Research  Goldman-Rakic was the first to discover and describe the circuitry of the prefrontal cortex and its relationship to working memory. Previously, scientists thought that the higher cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex were beyond the scope of scientific study. Goldman-Rakic's research showed that methods employed to study the sensory cortices could be adapted to the highest order prefrontal cortical areas, revealing the circuit basis for higher cognitive function. Because of Goldman- Rakic, scientists began to better understand the neurobiological basis of higher cognitive function, and of such disorders as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. She used a multidisciplinary approach, applying biochemical, electrophysiological, pharmacological, anatomical and behavioral techniques to study working memory. She pioneered the first studies of dopamine influences on prefrontal cortical function, research that is critical to our understanding of schizophrenia, ADHD and Parkinson's disease. A review of her life's work, including her special role mentoring women scientists, can be found in Neuron. Goldman-Rakic co-authored over 300 scholarly articles and co-edited 3 books. She co-founded the Cerebral Cortex Journal, a specialized publication by Oxford Press, with her husband Dr. Pasko Rakic. Early in her career, she studied the capacity of the brain to repair itself in early development, and was one of the first to use radioactive tracers to examine this phenomenon. She used microelectrode recording in her research and challenged the traditional notion that memory was not controlled or involved in the frontal lobe; she asserted that working memory was in its own structure apart from long-term memory. Personal life Goldman-Rakic had two sisters, Dr. Ruth Rappaport, her identical twin, and Dr. Linda Faith Schoer. She was married to Dr. Lawrence Goldman. She re-married Pasko Rakic, also a neuroscientist, in 1979. Death On July 29, 2003, Goldman-Rakic was struck by a car while crossing a street in Hamden, Connecticut. She died two days later, on July 31 at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She is buried in Grove Street Cemetery. In memory or Goldman-Rakic, Constance and Stephen Lieber created the Goldman-Rakic Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Cognitive Neuroscience to celebrate her memory and her discoveries about the brain's frontal lobe. This prize is awarded every year to outstanding scientists, from psychiatrist to molecular neuroscientist, for their impact on the study of cognition. The prize carries an award of $40,000 and the winners are honored at the annual International Awards Dinner in New York City.https://www.bbrfoundation.org/grants-prizes/prizes-awards/goldman-rakic- prize-outstanding-achievement-cognitive-neuroscience  Honors and awards  Goldman-Rakic was also the President of the Society for Neuroscience from 1989-1990 and a fellow of The American Psychological Association.

It evaluates to the offset (in bytes) of a given member within a struct or union type, an expression of type . The \`offsetof()\` macro takes two parameters, the first being a structure name, and the second being the name of a member within the structure. It cannot be described as a C prototype. Implementation The \\"traditional\\" implementation of the macro relied on the compiler obtaining the offset of a member by specifying a hypothetical structure that begins at address zero: #define offsetof(st, m) \\\\ ((size_t)&(((st *)0)->m)) This can be understood as taking a null pointer of type structure , and then obtaining the address of member within said structure. While this implementation works correctly in many compilers, it has generated some debate if this is undefined behavior according to the C standard, since it appears to involve a dereference of a null pointer (although, according to the standard, section 6.6 Constant Expressions, Paragraph 9, the value of the object is not accessed by the operation). It also tends to produce confusing compiler diagnostics if one of the arguments is misspelled. An alternative is: #define offsetof(st, m) \\\\ ((size_t)((char *)&((st *)0)->m - (char *)0)) It may be specified this way because the standard does not specify that the internal representation of the null pointer is at address zero. Therefore the difference between the member address and the base address needs to be made. Again, since these are constant expressions it can be calculated at compile time and not necessarily at run-time. Some modern compilers (such as GCC) define the macro using a special form (as a language extension) instead, e.g. #define offsetof(st, m) \\\\ __builtin_offsetof(st, m) This builtin is especially useful with C++ es or s that declare a custom unary . Usage It is useful when implementing generic data structures in C. For example, the Linux kernel uses to implement , which allows something like a mixin type to find the structure that contains it: #define container_of(ptr, type, member) ({ \\\\ const typeof( ((type *)0)->member ) *__mptr = (ptr); \\\\ (type *)( (char *)__mptr - offsetof(type,member) );}) This macro is used to retrieve an enclosing structure from a pointer to a nested element, such as this iteration of a linked list of objects: struct my_struct { const char *name; struct list_node list; }; extern struct list_node * list_next(struct list_node *); struct list_node *current = /* ... */ while (current != NULL) { struct my_struct *element = container_of(current, struct my_struct, list); printf(\\"%s \\", element->name); current = list_next(&element-;>list); } The linux kernel implementation of container_of uses a GNU C extension called statement expressions. It's possible a statement expression was used to ensure type safety and therefore eliminate potential accidental bugs. There is, however, a way to implement the same behaviour without using statement expressions while still ensuring type safety: #define container_of(ptr, type, member) ((type *)((char *)(1 ? (ptr) : &((type *)0)->member) - offsetof(type, member))) At first glance, this implementation may seem more complex than necessary, and the unusual use of the conditional operator may seem out of place. A simpler implementation is possible: #define container_of(ptr, type, member) ((type *)((char *)(ptr) - offsetof(type, member))) This implementation would also serve the same purpose, however, there's a fundamental omission in terms of the original linux kernel implementation. The type of ptr is never checked against the type of the member, this is something that the linux kernel implementation would catch. In the aforementioned type-checked implementation, the check is performed by the unusual use of the conditional operator. The constraints of the conditional operator specify that if the operands to the conditional operator are both pointers to a type, they must both be pointers to compatible types. In this case, despite the fact that the value of the third operand of the conditional expression will never be used, the compiler must perform a check to ensure that \`(ptr)\` and \`&((type *)0)->member\` are both compatible pointer types. Limitations Usage of \`offsetof\` is limited to POD types in C++98, standard-layout classes in C++11, and more cases are conditionally-supported in C++17, otherwise it has an undefined behavior. While most compilers will generate a correct result even in cases that don't respect the standard, there are edge cases when will either yield an incorrect value, generate a compile- time warning or error, or outright crash the program. This is especially the case for virtual inheritance. The following program will generate several warnings and print obviously suspicious results when compiled with gcc 4.7.3 on an amd64 architecture: #include #include struct A { int a; virtual void dummy() {} }; struct B: public virtual A { int b; }; int main() { printf(\\"offsetof(A, a) : %zu \\", offsetof(A, a)); printf(\\"offsetof(B, b) : %zu \\", offsetof(B, b)); return 0; } Output is: offsetof(A, a) : 8 offsetof(B, b) : 8 References Category:C standard library ","title":"Offsetof"},{"id":"11866729","text":"The Four Nations Initiative (4NI) is a cooperation project started in 2005 as an initiative by Chile, South Africa, Sweden and Thailand. The initiative was created to contribute to the efforts to reform governance and management systems and structures of the UN Secretariat, departing from the perspective of the UN Member States. The Four Nations Initiative, active from early 2006 until October 2007, consists of a steering committee with representatives from all four countries, and a secretariat based in Stockholm. UN Secretariat reform is an important topic and was high on the agenda during the tenure of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. There have been many reform efforts, notably the Secretary-General's reports Investing in the United Nations and Mandating and delivering, both from March 2006, and the Comprehensive review of governance and oversight in the UN, June 2006. The Four Nations Initiative differs from the above-mentioned reform initiatives by being driven by Member States themselves.

EoPoS is a standardized method for transporting native Ethernet frames over the existing telecommunications optical infrastructure use both the established Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) transport technologies. Application of EoPoS  Description  EoPoS is a standardized method for transporting native Ethernet frames over a SONET/SDH network, by first mapping into one or more PDH tributaries such as T1, E1, or DS3. The tributaries can then be dropped from a legacy ADM, delivered to the customer premises, and the PDH links resolved back to an Ethernet connection by a piece of equipment supporting EoPDH. The technologies used in EoPoS include GFP frame encapsulation, Ethernet Mapping, Virtual Concatenation, Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme, and Management Messaging (OAM). Common practices in EoPoS equipment also include the tagging of traffic for separation into virtual networks, prioritization of user traffic. Standards from the ITU-T include: * ITU-T G.7041 Generic Framing Procedure * ITU-T G.7042 Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme * ITU-T G.7043 Virtual concatenation of plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) signals * ITU-T G.8040 GFP frame mapping into Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH) * ITU-T Y.1730 Requirements for OAM functions * ITU-T Y.1731 OAM functions and mechanisms  Use  By first mapping into one or more PDH tributaries such as T1, E1, or DS3, the component Ethernet contained in separate PDH signals from a central location can be fanned out to multiple locations. EoPoS allows transport of native Ethernet frames over a SONET/SDH network. Then the component PDH can then be separately dropped using a legacy add-drop multiplexer. Finally, the PDH links are resolved back to Ethernet connections by equipment supporting EoPDH. For proper operation each of the virtual local area network must be individually tagged using IEEE 802.1Q for example.

There was, of course, a substantial body of Latin medical writing circulating in western Europe in the early Middle Ages,Augusto Beccaria, I Codici di medicina del periodo presalernitano (secoli IX, X e XI) (Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1956). but the Pantegni was the first text to bring together, in one place, a broad array of learning on anatomy, physiology, and therapeutics. It was dedicated to Abbot Desiderius of Monte Cassino, before he became Pope Victor III in 1086.Charles Burnett and Danielle Jacquart, eds., Constantine the African and 'Alƒ´ ibn al-'AbbƒÅs al-Ma«ß≈´sƒ´: The Pantegni and Related Texts, Studies in Ancient Medicine, vol. 10 (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1994). In 2010, a manuscript at the Hague known to scholars since the early 20th century,A.

A distinction is made between theorica and practica, as it has been made before in the so-called Isagoge Johannitii, an earlier medical text that was originally written by Hunayn ibn Ishaq. Each part of al-Majusi's original, Theorica and Practica, had had ten books. The Theorica was translated in its entirety. However, in Constantine's version, the Practica was never completed, perhaps because of damage that occurred when Constantine brought his books from North Africa to Italy. Extant manuscripts show that initially only a three-book Practica was in circulation in the early part of the 12th century, consisting of Book I on regimen, the first half of Book II on simple (uncompounded) medicinal substances, and the first third of Book IX on surgery.Monica H.

Interest in the surgical material prompted two subsequent translators, a converted Muslim and a Christian physician from Pisa, to complete the translation of Book IX in 1114-15, during a siege of the Balearic Islands.J.

Research by Monica H. Green and Iolanda Ventura has demonstrated, however, that more of the Pantegni, Practica seems to have been translated by Constantine, perhaps toward the end of his life, than scholars had hitherto known. Green established that at least three twelfth-century manuscripts contain translations of Books VI and VII (on diseases of the thorax and gastro- intestinal system, respectively).Monica H. Green, ‚ÄúSalvage from an Eleventh- Century Shipwreck: Lost Sections of an Arabic Medical Encyclopedia Discovered in Pembroke College, Oxford,‚Äù Pembroke College, Oxford, Library Blog, 02 December 2015, http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/Green; Monica H.

Ventura not only identified the existence of a mid-twelfth-century manuscript copy of the tenth book of the Practica, the antidotarium (on compound drugs), but she also established that Constantine (or an associate) did complete the translation of the second half of Book II of the Practica, translating the section on simple (uncompounded) medicines.

Tanja Pommerening and Walter Bisang (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2017), pp. 101-166. There were, in other words, bits and pieces of at least six of the ten books of the Pantegni, Practica in circulation in the 12th century. But they were scattered and in some cases incoherent. A devotee of the Constantinian project did not give up the goal of seeing the Practica finally made whole. Perhaps as late as the early thirteenth century, this still anonymous editor pieced together a \\"complete\\" version of the Practica, gathering all the sections that Constantine had translated himself and fusing them with excerpts from several of Constantine's other translations (such as the Viaticum and his translation of Isaac Israeli's 10th-century book on fevers) and weaving them together into what passed as al-Majusi's full ten-book treatise.Monica H.

This \\"re-created\\" twenty-book Pantegni (now joining together the 10 books of the Theorica and the newly constituted 10 books of the Practica) began to circulate by the second quarter of the 13th century and would be printed in 1515 under Isaac Israeli's name. In 1127, Stephen of Antioch, a Pisan notary working in the Crusader state of Antioch, criticized the incompleteness and poor quality of Constantine's Pantegni and re-translated al-Majusi's Arabic treatise anew.

The operation was launched after the failure of Operation Karbala-2 and Operation Karbala-3 to move the Iraqi lines in an effort to capture Iraqi territory. Prelude The battle itself was planned and eventually executed by Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. The operation would be launched under cover of darkness in order to gain a foothold along the Shatt- al-Arab waterway. Once across, the Iranian forces would go on the offensive and eventually move onto the port city of Basra. The attack would be launched towards the Umm ar-Rasas Island in the Shatt al Arab. It most likely was meant as a diversionary attack before the upcoming Operation Karbala-5 (although it may have been called that only after it failed). It would attack from Umm ar- Rasas island to other islands and roads to help create a broad encirclement of Basra. It may have been rushed ahead to intimidate the Islamic Summit Conference meeting in then Iraqi ally Kuwait. The Iraqis had constructed heavy static fortifications around the city. They built 5 defensive rings, supported by natural waterways such as the Shatt-al-Arab, and manmade ones, such as Fish Lake and the Jasim River, along with manmade earth barriers. Fish Lake was filled with mines, underwater barbed wire, electrodes and various sensors. In addition, behind each waterway and defensive line was radar-guided artillery, ground attack aircraft, and combat helicopters; all capable of firing poison gas in addition to conventional munitions.[12] Iran's strategy was to penetrate through these massive defensive lines, and encircle Basra, cutting off the city as well as the Al-Faw peninsula from the rest of Iraq. While being the largest and most sophisticated attack since 1984, it was actually a part of Iran's strategy of attrition, in order to strike an unsustainable blow against Iraq, as the Iranians had little hope of a decisive victory in the face of Iraq's massive rearmament. There were hopes that it could bring about Iraq's downfall through sheer depletion. [75] Iran's plan was for a diversionary attack near Basra (Karbala-4), the main offensive (Karbala-5), and another diversionary attack using Iranian armor in the north to have Iraqi heavy armor diverted away from Basra (Karbala-6).[12] For these battles, Iran had swelled their military ranks by recruiting many new Basij and Pasdaran volunteers. The battle The operation began during Christmas night of 1986 with elite frogmen of the Pasdaran crossing the lake in rubber speedboats to launch a surprise attack upon Umm ar-Rasas Island. Upon landing, Iraqi searchlight operators found the frogmen. The Iranians were now totally exposed. Iraqi machine gunners opened up with a hail of bullets, killing all but a few of the Iranian force. The following morning, 60,000 Pasdaran and Basijis crossed the Shatt al-Arab north and south of Khorramshahr in dinghies and motorized seacraft, using the cover of dawn to hide their movements. Almost immediately, the Iranians met the Iraqi defenses waiting for them on the shorelines of the island. A major drawback for the Iranians came in the form of little to no artillery support against the Iraqis. However the Iranians quickly overran Umm ar-Rasas and the other islands, and they crossed them using pontoon bridges. But when they tried to move up the road along the waterway to envelop Basra from the south, they came under withering Iraqi fire. A major inadequacy in Iranian military preparations for the offensive was the practically non-existent follow up support provided to their forces once they broke out from the islands. With the exception of limited artillery support, all of it remained on the Iranian side of the Shatt al-Arab and did not follow with the initial advance of their own forces. Fighting lasted for three days, during which the Iranian forces were pummeled by the Iraqi defenses. Iraqi troops used artillery, aircraft, and machine guns firing from prepared defenses. Iranian troops died by the thousands. Iraqi casualties were one-sixth that of Iranian losses. By the time the Iranians retreated, thousands of dead Iranian soldiers covered the landscape. Iran had lost 12,000 troops, while Iraq had lost 2,000. Iran claimed Iraq's defenses benefited from US supplied intelligence which provided details of Iranian plans and preparations, thus permitting Iraq to coordinate an effective defense as precise points where the attack occurred. Iraqi mistreatment of captured Iranian forces, including the burying alive of military divers became the subject matter for the 2015 Iranian film 175 Divers.http://presstv.ir/Detail/2015/09/18/429700/Iran-divers-Iraq-war Aftermath The battle killed about 1000 Iranians (while wounding 11000) and 2,000 Iraqis in those three days alone. However, this battle proved to be the beginning of a major offensive of which would last until February. The operation had been poorly planned, and doubtlessly rushed due to the Kuwait conference. The Iranians (with the exception of the night attack and the amphibious crossings) did not use their innovative tactics and mainly used human waves.

Specifically, he served as a Mashpia (Hasidic mentor) and shochet. He was a follower of the Rebbe Rashab and the Rebbe Rayatz.  Biography  Reb Zalman Moishe was born in Nevel, Russia, to his father, Reb Dovber (\\"Berel Der Shoichet\\"), who was the Chabad shochet in Nevel. The surname HaYitzchoki indicated their lineage to Rashi. His mother was Rochel Zisselson, the daughter of a prominent Lubavitch family in Nevel. He married Neshe Reines of Zhembin, the Reineses were a prominent Rabbinic family in White Russia.Anoshim Chassidim Hoyu, Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, Israel, 2003, p. 11 After marrying, Reb Zalman Moishe began studying unofficially part-time at the Tomchei Temimim Yeshiva in Zhembin, and this brought him to become intensely devoted to the study of Chabad Chassidus. He would come to attend the lectures on this topic delivered by Reb Shmuel Groinem Esterman, the official Mashpia.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki p. 11 Several years later he moved to Schtzedrin, a small village founded by the Tzemach Tzedek, and populated exclusively by Chabad Chassidim. He accepted the request of the village's inhabitants that he come practice shechita. This was during World War I, a time when abject poverty prevailed. Nevertheless, Reb Zalman Moishe was careful to distribute all his earnings to the needy.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 14 After his father died in 1919 he returned to Nevel to replace his father as the city's shochet. He immediately became one of the central personalities in the city, and his home became a centre for Chassidic farbrengens.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 15 In the year 1933 he decided to immigrate to the Holy Land. In order to file his application he moved to Moscow, where he stayed for two years, until his application was accepted in 1935.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 35 He then moved to Tel Aviv. In the early 1940s he suffered partial paralysis, and would spend most of the day studying the Chasidic discourses of the Rebbe Rashab, and praying at great length.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 48 His children were: *Sarah (1904-1997) wife of the Mashpia Rabbi Avrohom Drizin (Mayorer) (1900-1991) *Shmuel (1906-1986) *Faya (1920-1983) wife of Rabbi Meir Borovski (1915?-1994?) He is buried in Tzfas. Personality Reb Zalman Moishe was known for his sharp and even crude style of rebuke during farbrengens. However, those who knew him well understood that the \\"real\\" Reb Zalman Moishe was refined and considerate. Nevertheless, he used this approach at farbrengens because he believed that then is the appropriate occasion to deal with the animal soul, which understands no other language.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, pp. 33-34 When he arrived in Tel Aviv, some elderly Chassidim there were upset at Reb Zalman Moishe‚Äôs sharp style of farbrengens. They wrote a letter of complaint to Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneerson, who replied, saying that their letter caused him ‚Äúgreat pain and much sorrow of the spirit,‚Äù and completely dismissed their complaints.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 41 A characteristic episode is told concerning his sense of submission to the Chabad Rebbes: The Rebbe Rayatz once turned to him at a farbrengen and said something to him. Afterwards, the other Chassidim asked him what the Rebbe had said. \\"I didn't hear one word,\\" he responded, \\"only one thought bothered me at that moment: When will the Rebbe already remove his holy eyes from my disgraceful face?\\"Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 24 Piety For many years he maintained a regimen of study of Chassidus: Early every morning he would study for six consecutive hours. He would then go to work for several hours as a shochet. He would then eat something, rest a bit, and pray for several hours.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 32 Upon the urging of the Rebbe Rashab he recited the Tikkun Chatzos midnight prayer of mourning over the destruction of the Beis HaMikdash his entire life. Held in high esteem The Rebbe Rashab would refer to him affectionately as \\"my Zalman Moishe.\\"Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 12 He was held in such high esteem by the Rebbes of Chabad that the Rebbe said that \\"an aphorism of Zalman Moishe is told over in the house of the Chabad Rebbes (Beis HoRav).\\"Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 19 In the condolence letter sent by the Rebbe to the family after his death, the Rebbe referred to him as a Tzaddik. This is extraordinary, as the Rebbe had not referred that way to any other Chossid.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 53 The Rebbe Rayatz said of Reb Zalman Moishe to the Chabad residents of Tel Aviv: ‚ÄúHe is one of the few unique ones who diligently study and comprehend Chassidus. He is expert in many discourses of my father [the Rebbe Rashab]. They should strive to find him an appropriate position as a shochet, and draw him exceedingly close.‚ÄùYosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 38  Students  Reb Zalman Moishe‚Äôs distinguished students included Reb Mendel Futerfas, Reb Nissan Neminov, and Reb Yoel Kahn.Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 50 Once Reb Nissan said to Reb Mendel, \\"Listen, Mendel, the small amount of Chassidic enthusiasm that we have is from what we received from Reb Zalman Moishe!\\"Yosef Yitzchak Kaminetzki, p. 54  Footnotes  Category:Chabad-Lubavitch rabbis Category:1952 deaths Category:Russian Orthodox rabbis Category:Hasidic rabbis in Israel Category:Hasidic rabbis in Europe Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Chabad-Lubavitch (Hasidic dynasty) ","title":"Zalman Moishe HaYitzchaki"},{"id":"11866976","title":"Equinor"},{"id":"11866980","text":"This article lists honours and records associated with Sheffield United F.C..

He was elected a representative peer in 1809, created Earl of Blessington in 1816, and inherited the title of Viscount Mountjoy in 1829. He was present at the trial of Queen Caroline. After she left her first unhappy marriage, Margaret Power had stayed for almost three years with her parents, then moved to Cahir, in 1809 to Dublin, and from 1809‚Äì1814 with a Dublin acquaintance, Captain Thomas Jenkins, of the 11th light dragoons, with whom she formed a close relationship. It was during her Hampshire stay that she met Gardiner, 7 years her senior. (Gardiner's first wife died sometime after 1812, having borne him two illegitimate children prior to their marriage and two legitimate children, Lady Harriet Gardiner and Luke Wellington Gardiner, Viscount Mountjoy). Jenkins received ¬£10,000 from Gardiner to cover the jewels and clothing that he had purchased for Margaret, buying his approval for Gardiner's and Power's marriage, after which she changed her name to Marguerite. Honeymooning in Ireland, they returned to a newly leased town mansion at 10 St. James's Square, London, in 1820. This address (now the base of Chatham House) soon became a social centre, but their heavy spending and extravagant tastes meant that, despite his annual income of ¬£30,000 from his Irish estates, they were soon both heavily in debt. On 25 August 1822 they set out for a continental tour with Marguerite's youngest sister, the twenty-one-year-old Mary Anne, and servants. They met Count D'Orsay (who had first become an intimate of Lady Blessington in London in 1821) in Avignon on 20 November 1822, before settling at Genoa for four months from 31 March 1823. There they met Byron on several occasions, giving Lady Blessington material for her \\"Conversations with Lord Byron\\". After that they settled for the most part in Naples, also spending time in Florence with their friend Walter Savage Landor, author of the \\"Imaginary Conversations\\" greatly admired by Lady Blessington. It was in Italy, on 1 December 1827, that Count D'Orsay married Harriet Gardiner to strengthen the tie between himself and her stepmother Lady Blessington. The Blessingtons and the new couple moved to Paris towards the end of 1828, taking up residence in the H√¥tel Mar√©chal Ney, where the Earl suddenly died at forty- six of an apoplectic stroke in 1829. D'Orsay and his wife then accompanied Lady Blessington to England, but the couple soon separated. D'Orsay lived with Lady Blessington until her death, and she let out the Earl's St James's house.

Its length is 8 km and its maximum width about 6 km. Horses of Delft Island Neduntheevu is a flat island surrounded by shallow waters and beaches of coral chunks and sand. It is home to a small population of Tamil people, mostly living in quiet compounds close to the northern coast.Delft web page The vegetation is of a semi-arid tropical type, with palmyra palms, dry shrubs and grasses that grow on the pale grey porous coralline soil. Papayas and bananas grow close to the local people's homes. In the western coast of the island there are remains of a 1000-year-old temple built by the Chola Dynasty, as well as the ruins of a Dutch colonial fort. The water is slightly brackish, and it is taken from shallow wells using buckets made from palmyra palm leaves.UNEP Islands Home Page A naval battle was fought off the coast of the island in 2008 during the Sri-Lankan Civil War.

G. Wodehouse, which first appeared, under the title \\"First Aid for Freddie\\", in the United States in the October 1966 issue of Playboy magazine. Part of the Blandings Castle canon, it features the absent-minded peer Lord Emsworth, and was included in the collection Plum Pie (1966).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 99‚Äì100, A89. It was published, under the title \\"First Aid for Freddie\\", in the United Kingdom in the April 1967 issue of Argosy, after being published in Plum Pie in the UK.McIlvaine (1990), p. 165, D74.4. Plot summary Freddie Threepwood is back at Blandings on Dog-Joy business, and his wife Aggie, finding country life a little dull, has headed to the French Riviera. Freddie has befriended Valerie Fanshawe, in hopes of persuading her father, local hunting bigwig Colonel Fanshawe, to invest in Freddie's dog biscuits for his sizeable pack of hounds. Gally warns his nephew Freddie of the dangers of consorting with attractive young girls while his wife is away, but Freddie, hungry for the sale, opts to give Valerie an Alsatian she covets, although the dog belongs to Aggie - he believes he can replace it without her noticing. As Freddie leaves with his gift, Gally hears worrying news - his sister Connie is thinking about sacking venerable butler Beach, who has become a little wheezy in his old age. Freddie gets a telegram from his wife, informing him of her plan to return to Blandings the following day, and in his shock on reading it tumbles down the stairs, taking Gally with him. They are both laid up with sprained ankles, so Gally insists his unwilling brother Clarence must go to Marling Hall to retrieve the dog by stealth. Gally is visited in his sickbed by Valerie, who reveals that the dog has upset her father by attacking his beloved spaniel, and that she has thus returned it. Beach then informs him that Colonel Fanshawe has telephoned, requesting Lord Emsworth's judicial services as he has caught a prowler lurking outside his house. Realising Emsworth has been captured, Gally sends Beach to the rescue, armed with a Mickey Finn to knock out the Fanshawes' butler. Beach returns, somewhat shaken but successful, and when Connie brings up the idea of replacing him, Gally easily silences her by telling the tale of Emsworth's imprisonment in Fanshawe's coal-cellar, and Beach's full knowledge of this potential embarrassment to the family name. Publication history Under the title \\"First Aid for Freddie\\", the story was illustrated by Bill Charmatz in Playboy.McIlvaine (1990), p. 154, D51.15. In Argosy, the story was published with photos of Ralph Richardson as Lord Emsworth and Stanley Holloway as Beach from the 1967 Blandings Castle series of the television series The World of Wodehouse.

History of scholarship Jack Arthur Walter Bennett attended Mount Albert Grammar School in Auckland, New Zealand. He notably wrote the Mount Albert Grammar School hymn, which is sung at school assemblies to this day. Bennett studied at the University of Auckland, where he is described by biographer James McNeish as \\"poor and deserving\\" before going on to Merton College, Oxford, where, still indigent, he survived on a diet of Cornish pasties. In McNeish's book Dance of the Peacocks, he is noted as a member of what was to be described in British academe as the Oxford \\"New Zealand Mafia\\",McNeish, James (2003). Dance of the Peacocks: New Zealanders in Exile in the Time of Hitler and Mao Tse-tung. Random House New Zealand. p. 356-364 a loose-knit group of extraordinarily gifted young men from New Zealand who studied at Oxford University, many as Rhodes Scholars, before the Second World War. The link between them was to endure for the rest of their lives. The group included John Mulgan, Dan Davin, James Munro Bertram, Desmond Patrick Costello, Charles Brasch, Norman Davis and Ian Milner. McNeish describes Bennett as \\"at an angle, separated by the exuberance of his scholarship, his saintliness, and his forgetfulness ... he considered himself lucky to have received the Scholarship [to Oxford], since he forgot to include any testimonials with his application\\". McNeish also mentions Bennett's work with the British Information Service in America during World War II: asked to help out for a few weeks, he remained for the duration, returning to Oxford in 1943 and at the end of the war. He became best known as a scholar of Middle English literature. He was editor of the journal Medium Aevum from 1957 to 1981, having earlier assisted his predecessor, Charles Talbut Onions, and was a colleague of C. S. Lewis at Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1964 he succeeded Lewis as Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. His most substantial work was the volume on Middle English Literature for the Oxford History of English Literature, which was completed after his death by Douglas Gray and published in 1986. Other works include: a lecture series of The Parlement of Foules: An Interpretation (1957); Chaucer's Book of Fame: An Exposition of \\"The House of Fame\\" (1960); and Chaucer at Oxford and at Cambridge (1974). Bennet also edited several volumes, including The Knight's Tale by Chaucer, Early Middle English Verse and Prose (1966) edited with G. V. Smithers, and a collection of Essays on Malory (1963). He was one of the Inklings, an informal literary group that included two of the most important writers of the twentieth century, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, the authors of The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings respectively. He is buried at the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge with his wife, Gwyneth (1916‚Äì1980).

History Work on the upper range lights commenced in 1885 and was completed in time to allow activation in January 1886. An initial plan to reuse the west North Point Range Light was discarded in favor of a tiny brick structure constructed on the foundation of the old light. The keeper's house was built on the shore, and a long wooden bridge allowed access to the light itself. Initially a locomotive headlight was installed to show a fixed white light. Three years after improvements to the keeper's house were made in 1890, the bridge to the light was destroyed by a storm. Rather than rebuild it, the headlight was moved to the exterior of the light, and the keeper took up residence in the light itself. The light was electrified and automated in 1929. Although there are some claims that the light was rebuilt in 1938, this is believed to be a misunderstanding based on discrepancies in the reported height of the light over the years.

It was formed on 10 May 1953. It was founded by members of Torch Commando from Natal.Two New Parties For S. Africa; The Times, 11 May 1953; pg8 col G The party was also said to have support from leaders of the Commando in other provinces. It was a British diaspora party, committed to retaining links with the British Commonwealth and monarchy. The party was centred in Natal, concerned with ensuring the province's autonomy. Federal provincial autonomy was seen as a way preventing Afrikaner nationalism from dominating the political scene and could include ceding from the Union if that occurred or English language rights in the Union were interfered with. It also wished to explore liberalising the non-white franchise. The liberal franchise policy for non- whites included Indians to be enrolled on a communal voters roll similar to the Coloureds in the Cape Province and the possibility of a voters roll for Black South Africans who were highly educated.

He entered the Dominican Order at Brescia, his native city, and in 1450 was appointed to the office of inquisitor. He aided the papal auditor, Bernardo da Bosco, in putting an end to the teaching of impious doctrines at Bergamo. He also took a prominent part in the controversy between the Dominicans and the Minorites with regard to the Precious Blood. During Easter Week, 1462, St. James of the Marches, a celebrated Minorite preacher, maintained in a sermon at Brescia that the Blood separated from the Body of Christ during His Passion was thereby separated from His Divinity, and consequently was not entitled to adoration during the time that Christ remained in the sepulchre. As this doctrine had been proscribed by Pope Clement VI in 1351, James of Brescia cited James of the Marches to appear before his tribunal in case he should not retract. A dispute at once arose between the Dominicans and Friars Minor. Shortly before, in a papal bull written at Tivoli, Pope Pius II had declared that it was not contrary to Christian faith to hold that Christ did not reassume a part of the blood he shed in his passion. This declaration narrowed down the controversy to the question: Whether the Blood which Christ shed in his passion and reassumed at his resurrection was adorable as the blood of the Son of God during the three days that it was separated from his body. The affirmative was maintained by the Dominicans, the negative by the Minorites. The pope ordered a solemn disputation to be held before the pontifical court at Christmas, 1462 (1463, according to many). James of Brescia was one of three theologians who represented the Dominicans. Among the Minorite champions was Francesco della Rovere, later Pope Sixtus IV. After a debate of three days, a consultation was held by the pope and the cardinals, but no definitive decision was pronounced. In a Constitution dated 1 August 1464, two weeks before his death, Pius forbade all further disputation on the subject. A full presentation of the Dominican side of this controversy is preserved in an unpublished treatise written by James of Brescia and his two colleagues. Other theological works attributed to James are no longer extant.

Species  There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Rhynchodoras castilloi Birindelli, Sabaj P√©rez & Taphorn, 2007 * Rhynchodoras woodsi Glodek, 1976 * Rhynchodoras xingui Klausewitz & R√∂ssel, 1961 Description Rhynchodoras species are distinguished from all other doradids by their highly modified jaws which are strongly compressed, elongate, forceps-like in appearance, and project ventrally. The head is large and longer than it is wide, with a somewhat conical shape. There are three pairs of barbels, one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of mental barbels. Barbs occur on the dorsal fin and pectoral fin spines; on the anterior surface, barbs are curved towards the tip of the spine, and on the posterior surface are recurved away from the tip of the spine. The caudal fin is forked. There is a series of spined, lateral plates called scutes. Eyes are relatively small. R. woodsi can be differentiated from R. xingui by a smaller eye and a slightly longer upper jaw than lower jaw. Also, R. castilloi differs from R. woodsi by having abundant, punctate tubercles on the body, and it differs from R. xingui in the number of form of its scutes.

The 12 books in the Jinny series were published between 1976 and 1988 by Armada. They are currently in reprint by Catnip Publishers. Two more of her novels, Dream of Fair Horses (1975) and The Horse from Black Loch (1963) have been republished by Jane Badger Books. She has also written under the pseudonym Jane Eliot. The Jinny series books often contain this brief biographical information: > \\"Patricia Leitch started riding when a friend persuaded her to go on a pony > trekking holiday - and by the following summer she had her own Highland > pony, Kirsty. She wrote her first book shortly after this and writing is now > her full-time occupation, but she has also done all sorts of different jobs, > including being a riding-school instructor, groom, teacher and librarian. > She lives in Renfrewshire, Scotland, with a bearded collie called Meg.\\" Patricia Leitch was a vegan. Animal welfare and vegetarianism are strong themes in her books. Celtic, Arabic and Buddhist mythology and philosophy are also frequently referred to. The Jinny series marks a significant departure from the traditional 'tweedy' horse and pony stories aimed at middle-class children. Jinny is a scruffy, willful, tom-boyish girl who doesn't have any social or romantic aspirations. Serious social justice issues are raised throughout the series, forcing Jinny to confront her own prejudices and character faults. Underlying the series is a sense of predestination deriving from Celtic mythology. Jinny is portrayed as a gifted or chosen child with special and dangerous tasks to perform, guided by mysterious and sometimes frightening characters such as the Red Horse (agent of the Celtic Horse Goddess Epona) and the Walker. In this way it resembles the Dark Is Rising sequence by Susan Cooper.  Bibliography  The Jinny series: *1. For Love of a Horse (1976) *2. A Devil to Ride (1976) *3. The Summer Riders (1977) *4.

World War II Atlantic operations  Assigned to the Mine Warfare School, Yorktown, Virginia, Linnet engaged in experiments and training in the intricacies of mine operations. Upon completion of training in the spring 1942, the minesweeper sailed to join Fleet operations in the South Atlantic.  South Atlantic operations  Based at Recife, Brazil, Linnet played an important role in harbor clearing operations to permit the free movement of ships from that port. She regained in Brazilian waters until 22 February 1944, when she sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving there 17 March. Linnet was reclassified IX-168 on 20 April for possible use as a small cargo ship.

He was a major player in the Kakatiya Empire. The defeat of Velanati Chodas at the hands of Kakatiya emperor Ganapatideva (1241 CE) led to many Nayaka warriors migrating to Warangal and joining the Kakatiya army. Jayapa Nayudu, a valiant commander from Kammanadu, was made the chief of the elephant wing in the army.Bouddhamu-Andhramu, Hanumantha Rao, B. S. L., 1995, Telugu University, Hyderabad He was the uncle of Rani Rudrama Devi, Emperor Ganapatideva married Naramma and Peramma, sisters of Jayapa Nayudu(Ganapatideva's brother-in-law). Lineage Jayapa was the son of Pinna Choda whose father Narappa was the governor of the estuary region of river Krishna, also known as Diviseema. Narappa had four sons‚ÄîChoda, Pina Choda, Bhima and Brahma. All the brothers served as commanders in the army of Velanati Choda kings. Contributions Jayapa participated in the Kalinga conquest of Ganapatideva and was honoured with the title \\"Vairigodhuma Gharatta\\". He built a temple (Ganapeswara) in the honour of Ganapatideva and made a grant of many villages to the temple (1231 CE). He built another temple (Chodeswara) in the name of his father Pinna Choda in Chebrolu (Guntur district) and made a grant of Modukuru village to meet the temple expenses. According to the Chebrolu inscription (21 April 1235 CE) he also built two- storied quarters in two rows for Devadasis (Temple dancers) in front of the temple. Jayapa must have been an accomplished master of dance because his Sanskrit treatise \\"Nritya Ratnavali\\" is an authoritative text on Indian dance. Jayapa is the first person who wrote about the dances prevalent in Andhra Pradesh. Both Desi and Margi forms of dances have been included in Nritya Ratnavali. It contains eight chapters. Folk dance forms like Perani, Prenkhana, Suddha Nartana, Carcari, Rasaka, Danda Rasaka, Shiva Priya, Kanduka Nartana, Bhandika Nrityam, Carana Nrityam, Chindu, Gondali and Kolatam are described. In the first chapter the author deals with discussion of the differences between Marga and desi, tandava and lasya, Natya and nritta. In the 2nd and 3rd chapters he deals with angikabhinaya, caris, Sthanakas and mandalas. In the 4th Chapter Karnas, angaharas and recakas are described. In following chapters he described the local dance forms i.e. desi nritya. In the last chapter he deals with art and practice of dance.

Biography =Dragon Gate= He is the 4th graduate from the Dragon Gate dojo. He debuted in October 2005 against Don Fujii. After losing the match he was renamed Katsuo by Fujii. The name came from the comic strip Sazae-san, and his resemblance to the character Katsuo Isono. He joined Tozawa-juku in 2006, assuming the role of their drum bearer. He reverted to his real name with the Tozawa-juku faction, but he continued to wrestle in Dragon Gate NEX as Katsuo. Like his stablemate Akira Tozawa, he became known as a troublemaker backstage, and didn't seem to catch on with fans. In 2007, he started to gain weight, and eventually reached 102 kilograms. He became a charming fat man, wearing silver tights and boots instead of the gakuran pants worn by the rest of the Tozawa- juku unit, and it resulted in a big increase of his popularity. When it surpassed Tozawa's, it caused Tozawa to begin a similar weight gain program. They began to team together as the Metabolic Brothers within Tozawa-juku, but the team found no success. Ono was derailed by injuries, and the gimmick, despite having worked well for Ono previously, did not get over with the fans. On July 11, 2008, the team came to an end when Tozawa announced his intentions to go on a diet. He asked Ono to lose weight as well, but Ono refused and vowed to balloon up to 170 kilograms. On August 26, Yuki Ono asked for ‚Äì and was granted ‚Äì a release from his contract with Dragon Gate. However, it was all a ruse, for he immediately returned the next day as the heel \\"Cyber Kongcito\\", a miniature version of Cyber Kong, and joined Real Hazard. His identity was technically secret, but his voice and weight gave him away. The new gimmick did not improve his standing in the federation, and he was sparingly used. On December 21, he interfered in a Mask vs. Hair match between Cyber Kong and Naoki Tanisaki, and his attempt to aid Cyber Kong backfired, resulting in him being pinned. Real Hazard came out to protest the result, but Cyber Kong said he would own up to the mask stipulation ‚Äì except that it would be Kongcito's mask, not his. Kongcito was unmasked, beaten up, and kicked out of the group. His last appearance in wrestling was on the December 22, 2008 NEX card. Wrestling under his old Katsuo gimmick, he lost to m.c.KZ. This makes him the first wrestler trained at the Dragon Gate dojo to leave the promotion. =Post Dragon Gate= As of October 2011, Ono is working in Okinawa Pro Wrestling under the gimmick Ultra Mango.

Her popularity in Kerala is based chiefly on her short stories and autobiography, while her oeuvre in English, written under the name Kamala Das, is noted for the poems and explicit autobiography. She was also a widely read columnist and wrote on diverse topics including women's issues, child care, politics among others. Her open and honest treatment of female sexuality, free from any sense of guilt, infused her writing with power and she got hope after freedom, but also marked her as an iconoclast in her generation. On 31 May 2009, aged 75, she died at a hospital in Pune. Early life Kamala Surayya was born in Punnayurkulam, Malabar District in British India (present-day Thrissur district, Kerala, India) on 31 March 1934, to V. M. Nair, a managing editor of the widely circulated Malayalam daily Mathrubhumi, and Nalapat Balamani Amma, a renowned Malayali poet. She spent her childhood between Calcutta, where her father was employed as a senior officer in the Walford Transport Company that sold Bentley and Rolls Royce automobiles, and the Nalapat ancestral home in Punnayurkulam. Like her mother, Balamani Amma, Kamala Surayya also excelled in writing. Her love of poetry began at an early age through the influence of her great uncle, Nalapat Narayana Menon, a prominent writer. At the age of 15, she married bank officer Madhav Das, who encouraged her writing interests, and she started writing and publishing both in English and in Malayalam. Calcutta in the 1960s was a tumultuous time for the arts, and Kamala Das was one of the many voices that came up and started appearing in cult anthologies along with a generation of Indian English poets. English was the language she chose for all six of her published poetry collections. Literary career She was noted for her many Malayalam short stories as well as many poems written in English. Das was also a syndicated columnist. She once claimed that \\"poetry does not sell in this country [India],\\" but her forthright columns, which sounded off on everything from women's issues and child care to politics, were popular. Kamala's first book of poetry, Summer in Calcutta was a breath of fresh air in Indian English poetry. She wrote chiefly of love, its betrayal, and the consequent anguish. Ms Das abandoned the certainties offered by an archaic, and somewhat sterile, aestheticism for an independence of mind and body at a time when Indian poets were still governed by \\"19th-century diction, sentiment and romanticised love.\\" Her second book of poetry, The Descendants was even more explicit, urging women to: :Gift him what makes you woman, the scent of :Long hair, the musk of sweat between the breasts, :The warm shock of menstrual blood, and all your :Endless female hungers ...\\" ‚Äì The Looking Glass This directness of her voice led to comparisons with Marguerite Duras and Sylvia Plath At the age of 42, she published a daring autobiography, My Story; it was originally written in Malayalam (titled Ente Katha) and later she translated it into English. Later she admitted that much of the autobiography had fictional elements. \\"Some people told me that writing an autobiography like this, with absolute honesty, keeping nothing to oneself, is like doing a striptease. True, maybe. I, will, firstly, strip myself of clothes and ornaments. Then I intend to peel off this light brown skin and shatter my bones. At last, I hope you will be able to see my homeless, orphan, intensely beautiful soul, deep within the bone, deep down under, beneath even the marrow, in a fourth dimension\\" An Introduction is very bold poem in which she express es her true feelings about men. \\\\- excerpts from the translation of her autobiography in Malayalam, Ente Katha Kamala's \\"An Introduction\\" is an autobiographical poem written in the colloquial style. She presents her feelings and thoughts in a bold manner. She realises her identity and understands that it is the need of every woman to raise a voice in this male- dominated society. The poet longs for love it is the result of her loneliness and frustration. The poem \\"A Hot Noon in Malabar\\" is about climate, surrounding in a town in Malabar. The people may be annoyed by the heat, dust and noise but she likes it. She longs for the hot noon in Malabar because she associates it with the wild men, wild thoughts and wild love. It is a torture for her to be away from Malabar. Kamala Surayya is essentially known for her bold and frank expression. The prominent features of her poetry are an acute obsession with love and the use of confession. The main theme of her poetry is based upon freedom, love and protection. She wrote on a diverse range of topics, often disparate- from the story of a poor old servant, about the sexual disposition of upper-middle-class women living near a metropolitan city or in the middle of the ghetto. Some of her better-known stories include Pakshiyude Manam, Neypayasam, Thanuppu, and Chandana Marangal. She wrote a few novels, out of which Neermathalam Pootha Kalam, which was received favourably by the reading public as well as the critics, stands out. She travelled extensively to read poetry to Germany's University of Duisburg-Essen, University of Bonn and University of Duisburg universities, Adelaide Writer's Festival, Frankfurt Book Fair, University of Kingston, Jamaica, Singapore, and South Bank Festival (London), Concordia University (Montreal, Canada), etc. Her works are available in French, Spanish, Russian, German and Japanese. Kamala Surayya was a confessional poet whose poems have often been considered at par with those of Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell. She has also held positions as Vice-chairperson in Kerala Sahitya Akademi, chairperson in Kerala Forestry Board, President of the Kerala Children's Film Society, editor of Poet magazine and Poetry editor of Illustrated Weekly of India. \\"Dance of Eunuchs\\" is a fine poem by Kamala Das. It has an autobiographical tone. The poet sympathises with eunuchs. The eunuchs dance in the heat of the sun. Their costumes, makeup and their passion with which they dance suggest the female delicacy. Their outward appearance and joy is contrasted with their inward sadness. Actually there is no joy in their heart, they can't even dream of happiness. In the poem 'A Request' ,the poetess Kamala Das realises that her life is meaningless.She is alone and her life colourless designed of crumbling patterns. Although occasionally seen as an attention-grabber in her early years,The histrionics of Kamala Das The Hindu, 6 February 2000 she is now seen as one of the most formative influences on Indian English poetry. In 2009, The Times called her \\"the mother of modern English Indian poetry\\". Her last book titled The Kept Woman and Other Stories, featuring translation of her short stories, was published posthumously. Kamala Das is known for her controversial writings where she openly talks about the restriction imposed on women. She is known for her rebellious nature against the conventions.https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/kamala-das Personal life Kamala married Madhav Das at the age of 15.

Today, Begley is affectionately known as 'The Queen of Country'. Background Philomena Begley was born and grew up in Pomeroy, County Tyrone, and worked in a hat factory in Cookstown before her break into music. Career Her first venture as a singer was with the popular Old Cross C√©il√≠ Band, with whom she sang as a dare, but stayed with the group. The group soon became known as the Old Cross Bandshow and released three records in Ireland in 1968 and 1969, but none made an impression in the charts. In September 1970, the band changed its name to The Country Flavour. Begley's first record following this became her first chart hit when \\"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\\" reached number seven in the Irish chart. In 1974 she formed the Ramblin' Men, while the Country Flavour continued to tour with several other lead singers (including Eileen King and Dan O'Hara) during the 1970s. Begley regularly toured with Ray Lynam from 1975 and they recorded many duets together, probably their most popular being \\"My Elusive Dreams\\", which went on to be mentioned in The Pogues' song, \\"A Pair of Brown Eyes\\". In 1975, Begley had a hit with her version of Billie Jo Spears' hit song \\"Blanket on the Ground\\" which took her to number five in the Irish charts. Spears also released the song in the United Kingdom and in Ireland at the same time, but in Ireland, Begley's version received the highest sales, as Spears' version only went to number 11. Begley occasionally performed with Spears and later recorded a tribute song to her after the American star's death in 2011. By 1977, she was undertaking a major tour of the United States, and in 1978, she was invited to sing at the Grand Ole Opry by Porter Wagoner. Since then, she has returned annually to Nashville, been a guest of honour at the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York City, and has sung at both the Grand Ole Opry and Carnegie Hall. Although few of Begley's CDs have been released in the United States, a number are available for downloading on the site Freegal Music, a service provided by many libraries to their patrons. Recognition One of Begley's biggest fans is Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell, and he once said, \\"When Philomena sings a song you believe her‚Ä¶..you feel that she's experienced every emotion she expresses.\\" Personal life Philomena Begley is married to Tom Quinn and they have three children Mary, Aiden and Carol. She is also a grandmother. They reside on a farm in Galbally, County Tyrone. Her son Aiden Quinn has also established a singing career for himself. Her niece, Andrea Begley, won the BBC TV Series The Voice in June 2013. She is a regular contributor to the Belfast Telegraph's Lifestyle section.

Designed by Sacramento architect Edwin Kado to resemble the ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats, the building was built by the Money Store in 1997 and is currently leased by the California Department of General Services (DGS) as its headquarters since 2001. Located on more than adjacent to the Tower Bridge, the unusually designed office building contains more than of usable office area. Architecture Architect Edwin Kado describes the building as follows: \\"I originally designed a building that cantilevered toward the river, so it was like a pyramid upside down. It was 12 stories, and so when you got to the top floor, it was 120 feet toward the river. When I presented it to the president of the Money Store, he thought it was interesting, but he wanted a symmetrical building... I [then] suggested this shape...because that shape connotes stability, and I thought it would be a good image for the Money Store.\\" Structure and exterior Front entrance of the Ziggurat The structure of the building is a standard column and beam steel superstructure, set upon a pre-stressed concrete pile foundation system. The structural steel is designed to resist a seismic event of up to 6.9 on the Richter scale, an extremely high standard for the Sacramento area. The exterior skin of the building consists of Minnesota Gray Buff limestone panels. Each panel weighs over four tons. The building can be illuminated at night, but since 2001 the lights are turned on only for certain events. Technology Critical areas of the building have 75 kW emergency power back-up system and 300 kW UPS (uninterrupted power system). In addition, the building has a dual electric power feed from two separate electrical components. A centralized monitoring facility allows video security surveillance throughout the interior and exterior of the building. The communications center has a dual fiber feed from two local fiber communication companies (four separate fiber connections). In addition to dedicated telephone and computer equipment rooms on each floor, there is a raised floor computer room with isolated Liebert units for controlled temperature and climatic conditions on the third floor. The building has five traction elevators serving all floors, as well as an additional hydraulic elevator that provides service between the basement parking area and the first floor. Parking The on-site parking structure contains spaces for 1,649 vehicles. There are also accommodations for secured bicycle parking. All access into and out of the structure is controlled by card key access. The first floor is enclosed by wrought iron fence. The parking structure is cast-in-place concrete with tensioned decks. It is designed to withstand a 6.8 seismic event. Two traction elevators serve each floor. Amenities The building contains an employee fitness center equipped with Nautilus-style exercise equipment, shower and locker facilities.

It was a separate municipality but became administratively a part of Hav√≠≈ôov in 1960. It has a population of 673 (2010).2007 Statistics of Hav√≠≈ôov Village lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The name is of topographic origin, supposedly derived from an older name of a hypothetical river or stream Sucha, literally dry, therefore disappearing. The supplementary adjective Doln√≠ (German: Nieder, Polish: Dolna) means Lower denoting its lower location in comparison to sister settlements: Prost≈ôedn√≠ Such√° (Middle) and Horn√≠ Such√° (Upper).  History  The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Sucha utraque. It meant that there were two villages of that name (utraque meaning both in Latin), the other being Horn√≠ Such√°. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed at least since 1880 to political district and legal district of Freistadt. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 944 in 1880 to 2,237 in 1910. In terms of the dominant language spoken colloquially the situation was shifting through the censuses. In 1880 the majority were Czech-speakers (94.3%), followed by Polish-speakers (27 or 2.9%) and German-speakers (26 or 2.8%). In 1890 Czech-speakers constituted 55.9% and Polish-speakers 44.1%. The latter continued to grow to become majority (56.7% in 1900 and 58.9% in 1910), whereas the former formed minority (42.6% in 1900 and 38.1% in 1910). In 1910 they were accompanied by 57 (2.6%) German-speakers and 8 others. In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (60.1%), followed by Protestants (38.6%), Jews (21 or 0.9%) and 10 others. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Lachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect, additionally industrial growth lured a large influx of migrant workers, mostly from western Galicia.  Dukla mine  Sucha mine in 1924 There was a coal mine in the village - Dukla Mine. It was founded in 1905 as Kaiser Franz Joseph Schacht. The mining operations began in 1911-1912. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia and it was renamed to J√°ma Such√°. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. In 1949 the coal mine was renamed to D≈Øl Dukla (Dukla Coal Mine). During the operation of the Dukla Coal Mine more than 100 million tons of coal were mined. On the 19 June 2008 the last tower of the coal mine measuring was detonated.

Biography =Early career= Born in Northern Ireland, Anderson moved to England in 1972 with the dream of becoming a racing driver but instead found work as a mechanic at Motor Racing Stables at Brands Hatch. Some time later, he found a job at Brabham, helping to build their Formula 3 cars. He then began to work with the Brabham Formula 1 team and quickly progressed to become their chief mechanic. It was during his time at Brabham that he met his future wife, who sent a letter to Bernie Ecclestone on Gary's behalf seeking a job as a mechanic on the Brabham F3 team for him. In 1975, Gary and a mechanic called Bob Simpson, who worked for Tyrrell Racing, built a Formula 3 car called the Anson SA1. It was based on the Brabham BT38 and was raced by Anderson in Formula Libre. Anderson left Brabham at the end of 1976 to focus on designing the Anson SA2 Formula 3 car for 1977. Last minute withdrawal of sponsorship left the project in great difficulties and part-way through 1977, the car was withdrawn. Anderson rejoined F1 as chief mechanic at McLaren. He remained there for two years after which he joined the Ensign team. Soon after, Anderson and Simpson relaunched the Anson project, building very competitive Formula 3 and SuperVee cars. In 1985, Anderson went to America to become the chief engineer of the Galles Indycar team. It was here that he first teamed-up with driver Roberto Moreno. The pair would go on to have great success in Formula 3000; Anderson became technical director of Bromley Motorsport with Roberto Moreno as a driver and Moreno won the 1988 International Formula 3000 title for the team, using the Reynard F3000 chassis. Adrian Reynard hired Anderson to design the 1989 and 1990 Reynard F3000 chassis. At the same time he also designed the Spa series of open wheelers for the Formula 3000 based Formula Holden. Driving for Gibson Motor Sport, Mark Skaife finished third in a Spa FB001 in the 1990 Australian Drivers' Championship, before winning the championship in a Spa FB003 in 1991 and 1992. =Jordan (1991‚Äì1998)= In 1990, Eddie Jordan asked Anderson to design the very first Jordan Grand Prix car for the 1991 Formula One season. The Jordan Ford 191 was designed by Anderson and entered for the 1991 season. It achieved points finishes on seven occasions throughout the year, finishing the season 5th in the Constructors' Championship table. Anderson was made technical director of the team for 1992 onwards. The team scored its first podium position in the 1994 Pacific Grand Prix, with Rubens Barrichello driving the Anderson-designed Jordan Hart 194 (co-designed by Andrew Green). Anderson would remain with Jordan, despite offers from McLaren and Ferrari, until midway through the 1998 season when he was replaced by Mike Gascoyne. =Post-Jordan (1999‚Äì2001)= Following his departure from the Jordan team, Anderson joined the Stewart Grand Prix team, designing the Stewart Ford SF3 for the 1999 Formula One season. This season would be the most successful season for Stewart Grand Prix, achieving four podium finishes, including a win at the 1999 European Grand Prix. The team secured 4th in the Constructors' Championship for that season. Anderson said of team owner Jackie Stewart that he was \\"the best person I've ever worked for in my life\\". After Ford bought the Stewart team and renamed it Jaguar Racing for the season, Anderson remained to design their 2000 Formula One car. The Jaguar Cosworth R1 scored two points finishes in the 2000 Formula One season, ending the season 9th in the Constructors' Championship. Anderson was then replaced at Jaguar and spent 2001 in America working for Reynard in CART. =Return to Jordan (2002‚Äì2003)= Anderson reunited with the Jordan Grand Prix team in 2002. He co-designed the 2002 Jordan Honda EJ12 (with Eghbal Hamidy), which managed five points finishes, finishing the season 6th in the Constructors' Championship. Jordan lost backing of the Honda engines for 2003, and the Anderson-designed EJ13, now powered by Cosworth engines, finished the 2003 season 9th in the Constructors' Championship, but won a race (the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix). =Later work= Since leaving Jordan in 2003, Anderson has worked for several television broadcasters: firstly for RT√â from 2003-2005 followed by Setanta Ireland's coverage from 2006-2009 and ESPN Star Sports as a technical analyst and commentator. On 12 January 2012, the BBC announced that Anderson had been recruited as technical analyst and pitlane reporter for their coverage of the FIA Formula 1 Championship. In 2013 Anderson remained with the BBC1 BBC2 TV and BBC 5 Live teams as their Technical Analyst. BBC2 now broadcasting all live F1 practice on Friday and Saturday. In 2014 having left the BBC (who wished to move away from technical reporting) Anderson continued to explain the new breed of F1 cars in Autosport magazine and web page giving the F1 fans an insight into what will be this season, the biggest changes in Formula One Cars for many years using hybrid power which is a combination of fossil fuel power from a 1600cc turbo charged V6 engine and self generated electrical power.Formula 1 - Gary Anderson: test stories to watch - Yahoo Eurosport UK In 2014, Anderson joined the TV production team at Formula One Management (FOM) who produce all track televised F1 pictures, mainly to assist them in explaining the complexities of the new breed of F1 car. FOM will later be launching an F1 App which will use Anderson's technical insight. He commentated on the GP3 series with Will Buxton for Sky Sports in 2014. Anderson was awarded an honorary doctorate of science by the University of Ulster in 2014. In 2015 he started working with the newly formed company Typhoon, a firm focusing on producing motor-assisted bicycles. Anderson currently hosts his own podcast for The Race alongside F1 Journalist Edd Straw discussing the technical side of current Formula 1 news and events as well as his personal F1 experience. He also regularly appears on The Race's Bring Back V10's podcast.

Leopold Janauschek (13 October 1827 - 23 July 1898) was an Austrian Cistercian historian. Life Janauschek was born at Br√ºnn, Moravia. In 1846 he received the religious habit at the Cistercian Zwettl Abbey, Lower Austria, where he was professed in 1848. His superiors then sent him to their house of studies at Heiligenkreuz Abbey near Vienna, where he studied philosophy and theology. After his ordination to the priesthood he was made professor of history and canon law. His scholarly works attracted attention and won for him in 1858 the chair of ecclesiastical history in the University of Vienna. In 1859 he was recalled by his superiors to Heiligenkreuz, where he continued as professor until 1877. During this time he composed his first major work, Originum Cisterciensium Liber Primus (Vienna, 1877), in which he describes the foundation of the Cistercian Order, its organization and extension, and mentions many of those who, under various titles, had honoured it. He gives a lengthy account of 742 ancient abbeys of monks, founded between the end of the 11th and the end of the 17th centuries. The genealogical and chronological tables, as well as the work itself, required a colossal labour of research and compilation. He was unable to publish the second volume, which was to have been devoted to Cistercian nunneries, and for which he had collected a great deal of material. He also published, at this period, a work of lesser importance on the history of the Cistercian Order. His second major work is Bibliographia Bernardina. In 1891, on the occasion of the eighth centenary of the birth of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, the Cistercian Congregation of Austria prepared four volumes, under the title of Xenia Bernardina. Janauschek gave assistance in the preparation of the first three volumes, but the fourth, Bibliographia Bernardina (Vienna, 1891), was entirely his own work. He there discusses successively the different editions of the works of Saint Bernard and their translations, the essays on the life of the saint, various panegyrics, his biographers, the inscriptions in his honour, the opinions of ecclesiastical historians, etc. The books noticed in Xenia Bernardina amount to 2,761 printed works and 119 manuscripts. Despite weak health, which for many years permitted him to leave his room only at rare intervals, he worked on until his death in Baden, near Vienna.

Early life  Burton was born January 2, 1958, in Beckley, West Virginia, United States. He attended high school in Bethesda, Maryland, and became a volunteer with the Bethesda- Chevy Chase Rescue Squad at age 18, in 1975. He remains a Life Member of the organization, which bills itself as the world's largest volunteer rescue squad. His volunteer activities are briefly referenced in his first book, \\"Ghost: Confessions of a Counterterrorism Agent.\\" Some of the events in his early life are recounted in the 2011 book Chasing Shadows: A Special Agent's Lifelong Hunt to Bring a Cold War Assassin to Justice. Burton has said he was deeply impacted by the murder in 1973 of a neighbor, Joe Alon, who was later discovered to have been an Israeli intelligence operative.  Career  Burton began his career in law enforcement as a police officer in Montgomery County, Maryland and later worked for the U.S. Secret Service. From 1985 to 1999, he was a special agent with the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). He eventually became the deputy chief of the DSS counterterrorism division. While with the DSS, Burton was appointed by Washington to assist in the investigation of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He also investigated the killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane; the al Qaeda New York City bombing plots before the September 11 attacks; and the Libyan-backed terrorist attacks against diplomats in Sana'a and Khartoum. He was involved in the arrest of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. Mr. Burton joined Stratfor, an Austin, Texas-based geopolitical forecasting and analysis company, in 2004. Reflections on his experiences as a counterterrorism agent are recorded in his series, Lessons From Old Case Files. Additionally, he was appointed to the Texas Border Security Council on September 11, 2007 by Governor Rick Perry. In August 2009, he was hired as the Texas Department of Public Safety's Assistant Director for Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism but left after two months to pursue his writing and speaking career. Burton regularly briefs corporate executive teams on security related issues and speaks at a variety of both public and private events, including the Southern Law Network's 18th Annual General Counsel Event On Oct. 12, 2017, he moderated a panel at the Fourth Annual Texas National Security Forum at The University of Texas at Austin with former acting Director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin, former Acting Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency David Shedd, former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Intelligence and Analysis Leslie Ireland and former Under Secretary of Defense Marcel Lettre.  Books  Burton is the author of a memoir, Ghost: Confessions of a Counterterrorism Agent, published by Random House in 2008, and Chasing Shadows: A Special Agent's Lifelong Hunt to Bring a Cold War Assassin to Justice, published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2011. Under Fire: The Untold Story of the Attack in Benghazi, written by Burton and Samuel M. Katz, was published by St. Martin's Press in September 2013 and was a New York Times bestseller. [Vanity Fair] ran a lengthy excerpt from the book shortly before it was published. HBO has purchased the film rights to the book, with executive producer Jerry Weintraub to oversee production. In addition to his own memoirs, Burton has been referenced or portrayed in other books, including 1000 Years for Revenge: International Terrorism and the FBI -- Untold Storyhttps://www.amazon.com/1000-Years-Revenge-International- FBI--/dp/0060597259/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1393122015&sr;=1-3&keywords;=peter+lance by former ABC News correspondent Peter Lance and a commemorative book of photos published by the Department of State Diplomatic Security Service, 25 Years in Pictures. Burton's involvement in the search for and capture of Ramzi Yousef was chronicled in Relentless Pursuit: The DSS and the Manhunt for the Al-Qaeda Terrorists by Sam Katz (Forge, 2002). The acquaintance that was formed as Katz was writing this book led to his collaboration with Burton more than a decade later on Under Fire. Burton contributed a sidebar article to the book Countering Hate by Bob Pearson and Haroon K. Ullah called \\"Pushing the Boulder Up a Hill: Why Are Terrorist Operations Successful.\\" Marking the book's release in March 2018, Burton appeared with Pearson and Ullah for a panel at SXSW called Countering Hate: Understanding and Stopping Extremism. Burton's latest book,Beirut Rules, is co-written with Samuel Katz and will be released by Penguin Random House h in October of 2018.https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/72572/fred-burton The book chronicles the abduction, torture and murder of CIA Station Chief William Buckley by Hezbollah in the early 1980s. After reading Beirut Rules, former President George H.W. Bush said: ‚ÄúIn these pages, Fred Burton and Samuel Katz ably describe the selfless service and ultimate sacrifice of CIA‚Äôs William F. Buckley, murdered brutally while held as a hostage in Lebanon. Beirut Rules can‚Äôt bring this quiet hero back to life. But it will show a new generation the value of a life well lived in service of country.‚Äù  Film and TV appearances  Burton is frequently interviewed as a security expert by world news media on topics ranging from terrorist attacks to corporate security and U.S.-Mexico border security. He appeared in the documentary \\"Drug Wars,\\" by writer/director Gary \\"Rusty\\" Fleming (2008). He also was featured in Liora Amir Barmatz's 2011 documentary, \\"Who Shot My Father?\\", about the 1973 murder of Israeli Air Force colonel Joe Alon and his family's subsequent quest to solve the case. In May 2008, Burton was interviewed on Comedy Central's The Daily Show by host Jon Stewart. He regularly speaks with national and international media on counterterrorism, law enforcement and other security related matters, including the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. In July 2016, Burton sat down with Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer to discuss how corporate executives are responding to recent international terrorist attacks. In November 2016, Burton was featured in a Washington Post story on the potential threats to Trump-branded properties around the world after the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States.

Its foundation is Horn clause logic with equality which consists of predicates and Horn clauses for logic programming, and functions and equations for functional programming. ALF was designed to be genuine integration of both programming paradigms, and thus any functional expression can be used in a goal literal and arbitrary predicates can occur in conditions of equations. ALF's operational semantics is based on the resolution rule to solve literals and narrowing to evaluate functional expressions. In order to reduce the number of possible narrowing steps, a leftmost-innermost basic narrowing strategy is used which, it is claimed, can be efficiently implemented. Terms are simplified by rewriting before a narrowing step is applied and equations are rejected if the two sides have different constructors at the top. Rewriting and rejection are supposed to result in a large reduction of the search tree and produce an operational semantics that is more efficient than Prolog's resolution strategy. Similarly to Prolog, ALF uses a backtracking strategy corresponding to a depth-first search in the derivation tree. The ALF system was designed to be an efficient implementation of the combination of resolution, narrowing, rewriting, and rejection. ALF programs are compiled into instructions of an abstract machine. The abstract machine is based on the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) with several extensions to implement narrowing and rewriting. In the current ALF implementation programs of this abstract machine are executed by an emulator written in C. In the Carnegie Mellon University Artificial Intelligence Repository, ALF is included as an AI programming language, in particular as a functional/logic programming language Prolog implementation.

It is situated within the civil parish of Philleigh, on the Roseland Peninsula on the River Fal, between Truro and St Mawes, north of the King Harry Ferry. Made from slatestone rubble, the building probably dates from the 17th century, but was extended in the 19th century. It was designated Grade II listed status on 25 June 1985. The area was used as the assembly point for American troops before the D-Day landings and General Eisenhower stayed at the cottage during preparations for the landing. His chair was amongst memorabilia at the cottage which was auctioned off in 2012. The cottage was also frequented by members of the SS Uganda society while the ship was laid up nearby in the Fal. History The D-Day memorial On the opposite side of the River Fal to the National Trust property, Trelissick, stands Tolverne Cottage. The cottage was run for many years as a tea room, which sold tea grown on the Tregothnan estate, the first tea plantation in the UK. There is a regular ferry which connects the cottage to Falmouth during the summer. In preparation for the D-Day landings, some 27,000 American troops gathered in the Fal Estuary, and General Eisenhower stayed at Smugglers Cottage. A granite memorial stone was placed outside the cottage to commemorate the D-Day landings. The building contained a collection of memorabilia related to the landings, including Eisenhower's chair preserved in one of the rooms but the collection was put up for auction in 2012. The auction raised a total of ¬£10,000, including a telegraph from the Torpoint ferry which sold for ¬£1,700. Eisenhower's chair sold for ¬£480. On return to the UK, the SS Uganda was laid up in the Fal near Smugglers Cottage, so the society of devotees of the ship frequented the cottage. Architecture The two-storey cottage was probably built for fishermen in the 17th or 18th century and enlarged in the 19th. Its walls are slatestone rubble and the roof is wheat reed thatched. It is hipped to the left with a rubble chimney on the right gable end and another gable at the end of the rear wing with a brick chimney. The original cottage had two rooms, with another two rooms added at the rear that formed an L shape that is slightly set back. The angle was later filled in. There is one window in the south front that may have been the original rear of the cottage. There is a nearly central doorway with a two-casement window to the right with eighteen panes. The cottage was listed on 25 June 1985 by English Heritage.

It was a separate municipality but became administratively a part of the city of Hav√≠≈ôov in 1974. It had a population of 466 in 2010.Statistics of Hav√≠≈ôov Village lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. At 218 hectares in area it is one of the smallest villages in Zaolzie, and it is one of the youngest villages in the whole of Cieszyn Silesia.  History  The settlement of Datynƒõ was first mentioned in 1577 as z Datynie. It belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia and a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Later two separate settlements were differentiated: Doln√≠ and Horn√≠ Datynƒõ. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village became a part of the municipality of Doln√≠ Bludovice but gained independent status in June 1864. It was the subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 462 in 1880 to 586 in 1910. In 1880 80.7% of the population declared speaking Czech-language at home and the rest (19.3%) Polish language. In the three next censuses the majority were Polish-speakers (between 93.3% and 96.9%) followed by Czech-speaking minority (between 3.1% and 6.3%). In terms of religion in 1910 majority were Protestants (85.7%), followed by Roman Catholics (14.3%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Lachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. The first school, which conducted classes in both Polish and German, was built in the 19th century; it is not clear in what year it was completed. In 1879 a brick Polish school was built, and in 1920, a Czech school. The Polish school was closed several years after World War II due to lack of children. Its building now houses a Czech school.  Landmarks  The most notable landmark in the village is the Protestant chapel, built in 1886 by J√≥zef Prymus and Jan Ko≈Çorz.  People  Notable people associated with the village include J√≥zef Kiedro≈Ñ, Polish politician; Josef Kotas, Mayor of Ostrava; Franciszek Czy≈º, Polish politician; and Jan Bystro≈Ñ, Polish linguist.

The route runs from PA 63 in Upper Salford Township northeast to PA 412 in Nockamixon Township. The road runs through mostly rural areas in the northern parts of Montgomery and Bucks counties. Along the way, the route passes through the northern part of Perkasie and forms a concurrency with PA 313 in East Rockhill Township. North of here, PA 563 runs through Nockamixon State Park, heading to the north of Lake Nockamixon. PA 563 was first created in 1928 to connect Bergey to Harrow, following its current alignment to PA 313 before continuing straight along Ridge Road and continuing to PA 412\\\\. By 1940, construction of the road into a state highway was completed. In the early 1970s, PA 563 was moved to its current alignment north of PA 313 as a result of the creation of Lake Nockamixon, which severed the original alignment. Route description PA 563 northbound in East Rockhill Township PA 563 begins at an intersection with PA 63 in Upper Salford Township, Montgomery County and heads in an easterly direction on two-lane, undivided Ridge Road. The route passes through wooded areas with some homes, turning southeast at the Township Line Road intersection and forming the border between Salford Township to the northeast and Upper Salford Township to the southwest. PA 563 makes a northeast turn at the Barndt Road‚ÄìMoyer Road junction, continuing northeast on Ridge Road into Salford Township. The road passes over the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476) and PA 563 turns east and heads into the community of Tylersport, where it crosses Allentown Road. After leaving Tylersport, the route heads northeast into more rural areas. Upon crossing County Line Road in the community of Naceville, PA 563 enters West Rockhill Township in Bucks County and heads into a mix of farms and woods. After running to the southeast of James Memorial Park and passing through the community of Almont, the route intersects Lawn Avenue, which provides access to the PA 309 freeway at an interchange. PA 563 passes over the freeway a short distance after this intersection. The route continues east-northeast and crosses Bethlehem Pike and Old Bethlehem Pike in a commercial area in the community of White Horse. At the intersection with the latter, the road crosses into East Rockhill Township before it enters the borough of Perkasie and passes near residential neighborhoods, running along the top of a ridge. Farther to the northeast, PA 563 passes to the southeast of Pennridge Airport. At this point, the road continues into East Rockhill Township and heads through a mix of farmland, woodland, and a few residences. PA 563 comes to an intersection with PA 313, where it turns northwest to form a concurrency with that route on Dublin Pike, with Ridge Road continuing northeast. The two routes head through more rural land, crossing Threemile Run, before PA 563 splits from PA 313 by turning northeast onto Mountain View Drive. Along this road, the route heads into forested areas with occasional homes and enters Nockamixon State Park, a park which contains Lake Nockamixon. Upon crossing the Tohickon Creek, the road continues into Haycock Township. In this area, PA 563 skirts along the northwest edge of the state park. A short distance following the Deerwood Lane intersection, the road passes the main entrance to the park. PA 563 heads through the community of Haycock Run and crosses an arm of the lake formed by Haycock Creek into Nockamixon Township. In this township, the route leaves the state park and passes through rural areas before ending at PA 412. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, present-day PA 563 was not given a number. In 1928, PA 563 was designated to run from PA 63 near Bergey northeast to PA 412 near Harrow, following its current alignment south of PA 313\\\\. From this point, it continued northeast on Ridge Road, passing near Weisel and eventually continuing northeast to Harrow. At this time, the route was unpaved. By 1930, the route was paved south of PA 313\\\\. At this time, the sections of the route between Tylersport and southwest of Perkasie and north of PA 313 were under construction as state highways. All of PA 563 was completed by 1940. In the 1960s, construction began to create Lake Nockamixon along the Tohickon Creek near PA 563 in northern Bucks County. The Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, Maurice K. Goddard, proposed the lake as part of a goal for every Pennsylvania resident to be within of a state park. Lake Nockamixon was intended to fill a gap in between the Philadelphia and Lehigh Valley areas. As a result of building the dam and creating the lake, the northernmost portion of PA 563 had to be relocated to a new alignment to the north of the planned lake as it would sever a portion of the route north of Kellers Church. Between 1970 and 1972, construction took place on the new alignment of the route. As a result, PA 563 was routed to follow PA 313 to get from Ridge Road to its new alignment.

The ship's complement was 484 officers and enlisted men.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 65 Undaunteds main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) Mk V guns, one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on pivot mounts. Her secondary armament was ten BL guns, five on each broadside. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and ten QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, most of which were mounted on the main deck in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457 mm) torpedo tubes: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water. The ship was protected by a waterline compound armour belt thick. It covered the middle of the ship and was high. Because the ship was overweight, the top of the armour belt was below the waterline when she was fully loaded.Friedman, p. 146 The ends of the armour belt were closed off by transverse bulkheads . The lower deck was thick over the full length of the hull. The conning tower was protected by of armour. Construction and service Undaunted was laid down on 23 April 1885 by Palmers at their shipyard in Jarrow. The ship was launched on 25 November 1886, and completed on 18 September 1890. It was under the command of Captain Charles Bereford, his first command. She served with the Mediterranean fleet under overall command of Sir George Tryon. Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.198 On 21 March 1893, Undaunted, under the command of the then Rear Admiral Charles Beresford struck rocks on leaving Alexandria harbour, owing to an error by the ship's navigation officer, who gave the order to turn to Port instead of Starboard. The ship received minor underwater damage in the impact. She served two commissions on the China Station. On 25 April 1901, she was paid off at Devonport and placed in the Fleet Reserve, where she stayed for a year, until she was prepared to be commissioned as tender to HMS Cambridge, gunnery school ship at the dockyard. Captain Frederick Alexander Warden was appointed in command on her commission as tender on 26 August 1902.

Note: Japanese names are all in Western order (given name before family name). Main characters =Kosuke Ueki= *Romanized as Kousuke Ueki in the Animax version\\"The Law of Ueki.\\" Animax India. March 15, 2007. Retrieved on July 23, 2009. Kosuke Ueki is the main character in the series. He is in Class 1-C at Hinokuni Junior High School. Ueki's ability to change trash into trees is given to him by his king candidate Kobayashi (a.k.a. Mr. K), who is also Ueki's homeroom teacher. His level 2 power is to return an opponent's attack back to its original form. Ueki is actually a celestial sent to Earth by his father in order to take part in this tournament, which allows him to use the sacred weapons. He can use more than one Sacred Weapon at the same time because of his given ability. Ueki's most defining character trait is his sense of justice, a recurring theme throughout the series. He detests seeing people being oppressed, abused, or manipulated by others. Ueki is a genuinely kind person who is always trying to help people. He cares for people including his enemies, even going as far as saving Robert Haydn from falling debris. Ueki cares deeply about the environment, as he is seen planting trees in the town park. According to a short profile of the main characters of The Law of Ueki (published in the end of manga vol. 16 by the author), Ueki's hobbies include cleaning up his town. Ueki is also an unusually calm individual, and does not care about what happens to him. He can be found snoozing in class, letting children use him as a target for shooting soccer balls (or in one case, a surfboard), and also calling the police without panicking when he faces a gang of rowdy teenagers. Throughout the series, Ueki's main goal is to win the tournament and keep the Talent of Blank from falling into the hands of those who would abuse it. Later he also sets a goal to rescue king candidates such as Mr. K, Inumaru, and Nero who were unjustly sent to hell. At the end of the series, Ueki ultimately wins the tournament and the Talent of Blank. This is because he was judged as the strongest celestial and power user, having advanced the most in terms of growth. The sequel The Law of Ueki Plus hints he has feelings for Mori, as he states there that, if his memories of the most important person for him were erased, it would be Mori he would forget about. =Ai Mori= Ai Mori is one of Ueki's classmates at Hinokuni Junior High School. When in a casual mood, Ai is usually upbeat and friendly, although she is often shown with a very shallow side, initially believing that all power users (with the exception of Ueki) are dangerous enemies that can't be trusted. Still, Ai cares deeply for her friends, especially Ueki. She is strict with Ueki at times, especially when he looks like he is about to do something rash. Ai continuously tries to be his voice of reason, although her shallow antics and outspoken personality often annoys him. She claims Ueki to be her best friend, but it seems she may have a crush on Ueki as she often blushes when she sees him, but it is not admitted in the series. She has hypermetropia and always carries reading glasses over her forehead. The food she cooks tends to look rather odd and off-putting (usually with squirming octopus tentacles), but it still tastes good. Mori discovers Ueki's power early on, coming to a rather unusual conclusion and at first believing him to be an alien. Upon learning of the competition Ueki is in, she decides to back him up, to keep him from losing all his talents and disappearing because of it. Later on in the series, she is given an ability by the king candidate Inumaru during Ueki's fight with Sano. Once this power is activated, her opponent falls totally in love with glasses (usually Ai's) and will do anything to keep them from harm, like listening to Ai's orders or even defeat themselves. Also, they will not attack because they may accidentally break the glasses, and will do anything to prevent Ai from breaking them. However, her power's condition is that her opponent must perform a cutesy burikko pose (raising the right leg backwards while putting both of the fists close to the mouth region). =Seiichiro Sano= Sano, a 9th grader at Inaho Junior High School, can change towels into iron by holding his breath, but due to the limitations of animation, he frequently uses his power without any apparent limitations. Sano is highly competent and creative with his power, creating shields, springboards, traps, and even boomerangs which he calls \\"boomerang cutter\\". He is a formidable opponent with a high aptitude for combat and is considered to be a genius by others. He is very cunning and works extremely well with others to create powerful combination attacks. His level 2 power adds magnetic properties to his iron towels, of which he utilizes to great effect. Sano at one point joins the Robert's Ten for unknown reasons, prompting Ueki to confront him in battle. It is later revealed that the leader of the Robert's Ten (Carpaccio) had placed a Death Pentagon insect on Sano's king candidate Inumaru, that would kill him by instantly removing all his blood should Sano disobey him. Sano has a burn over his left eye which was caused during an accident with a hot spring. Still, he loves hot springs and hopes to win the Talent of Blank to obtain the talent to discover so he can find the greatest hot spring in the world for everyone to relax and enjoy. =Rinko Jerrard= Rinko has the power to change beads into bombs and creates special accessories in order to use her beads in more constructive ways such as: *Rinko Rocket - Made of a special alloy and then filled with beads. She uses this to blast herself up into the air *Beads Cannon - Special metal tubes that are filled with beads and then go over her fingers so that she can detonate one bead and send the rest of them rapidly at her opponents. *Her recent accessory is a special glove with beads hidden inside when used with her power, producing a force impact that claims to be as great as a close- contact weapon. She loves all animals, taking an immediate liking to Tenko (whom she calls \\"Tenko-chan\\"), but her weakness for cute things makes her vulnerable to Ban's power. It is wise not to insult her no matter what, for she has an evil alternate personality that violently attacks the person who insults her. She doesn't seem to realize that she has this evil side and forgets whatever her evil side says or does. She comes from a rich family and in the past many people had pretended to be her friend so that she would buy them things. Disillusioned with the seeming coldheartedness of the world, she succumbs to Robert's hypnotic charisma and joins the Ten. Initially, Rinko has a crush on Robert since he treats her as a real friend, but she eventually sees Robert for what he really is and joins up with Ueki, indeed becoming his guardian and constant caretaker. She is seen teaming up with Sano in various episodes. Rinko's Celestial King Candidate is a man named Nike, one of Margarette's followers whom she hasn't seen since the battle began. =Hideyoshi Soya= Hideyoshi has the ability to turn voices into portraits can make voices come out of them. The condition is that he needs to bend his fingers or toes. He is prone to deception, using various novelty gags and tricks in a fight such as soy sauce bomber. Although sometimes cowardly and weak, when Soya performs his sneak attacks in conjunction with his power he can be a formidable foe. In one occasion, he put his portraits on Sano's towels, then turned them back to voices in order to launch a sonic attack on Team Marilyn. In addition, his ability to use his opponent's voices as well make it easier to deceive his foes. He first appears as a power user that Ueki and Mori try to recruit as a fifth team member. He looks out for a group of kids at a place called the House of the Sun. His first king candidate, Nero, was a kind celestial that did not want to become the King of the Celestial World; he simply wanted to help out humans which he did at the House of the Sun. Soya offered to become his power user so that Nero could stay longer on Earth. Unfortunately, he helped Soya during a fight and was sent to Hell. Soya received a new king candidate, Zack, whom he hates for turning out to be a jerk and wanting him to join forces with a nasty bunch of power users. He agrees to help Ueki when he hears that they can save Nero. At the end of the series, Ai refers to him as the useless member of Team Ueki while also being the secret savior because he accidentally gave Ueki one last talent to save him from disappearing. =Kobayashi= Kobayashi, nicknamed as Mr. K (Kobasen in the Japanese versions), is a teacher at Hinokuni Junior High School. Mr. K is a king candidate who gives Ueki his power. He is Ueki's homeroom teacher and had been carefully studying him in order to judge his worth for the tournament. Kobayashi is usually a laid-back, forgetful, and friendly man, although he can be quite serious, depending on the situation. He has a very strong sense of justice, actually inspiring Ueki long ago when he saved him from falling off a building, and acts as both his mentor and role model. He is sent to Hell for saving (and thus helping) Ueki in his first fight against Robert Haydn. He then becomes Mori's king candidate, and returns to his old life due to Ueki winning the Talent of Blank and choosing the Talent to Reunite. =Inumaru= The king candidate who gave Sano his powers. The two officially pair up for the tournament when Sano risks his life to save a child from a burning building, and Inumaru does likewise despite Sano's threats. Inumaru's credo is that he can not ignore people in danger regardless of the reason, which prompts Sano to join, and to think of Inumaru as his friend rather than his Candidate. After being told that Sano joined the Robert's Ten to save him from the Death Pentagon (a small black bug that Carpaccio attaches to Wanko's neck, that would suck all of Wanko's blood out of him on command, thus killing him), he contrives to destroy himself, so that Sano can be freed from his obligation. He gives Mori his power, thus breaking the most important rule of the tournament, in order to force himself to go to Hell so that the others would be saved. He was chosen as the King of the Celestial World at the end of the series. =Tenko= (small) and (big) A large tailless yellow fox- like creature with duiker-like horns on his head, ten blue beady eyes (with the main pair three to six times larger than the other pairs), black bat-like wings, brown stripes on his limbs and with no visible ears that helps Ueki awaken his celestial powers. He can also change his shape to fit onto Ueki's wrist like an arm protector to give him advice, and seems to be able to communicate with Ueki telepathically. He is a celestial beast who is something of a mutation among his kind (he is born as an ancient version of a celestial beast, which is a ferocious-looking Godzilla-sized creature instead of an adorable cat-sized genetically-engineered house pet). Because of this he was treated very poorly by celestials and condemned for a crime he did not commit, but Ueki is the first to actually treat him with some kindness and respect. Fairly harsh with Ueki at times, he is nevertheless happy to have found someone who actually needs him. He also is very useful at giving advice in a fight. He is able to detect the power level of celestials (his eyes lights up and changes color to red depending on which level the celestial is on) and because of his mutations has a bigger version of what is called the \\"awakening organ\\" that can awaken the hidden powers within Ueki. Unfortunately, he can only use it to train celestials up to 7 levels without dying for every celestial. He also has an ability to spit out a large, roundish bunny creature that envelops Ueki and heals him within 12 hours. =Hanon= Hanon (Anon in the Japanese version) is a main antagonist that first appears in the middle of the anime series. He is from a race known as the Infernals (Hellions in the Japanese version), from the Protector clan. Hanon can swallow and absorb people within himself, thus making their bodies his, as well as gaining whatever abilities they have such as Robert's power and his Sacred Weapons. With a surprisingly humble nature, he has a hard time understanding humans and tends to experiment on them with reckless curiosity. He first told Ueki that his dream is to destroy everything, but in fact, his real dream is to have someone who can defeat him. In his first appearance he swallows Robert and steals his powers and appearance, taking his place in the tournament with the supposed intention of advancing the Infernals' goals. Later in the series, he swallows the King of the Celestial World and changes the rules of round four, declaring that his true goal is to destroy everything. He is Ueki's final opponent in the series. =Robert Haydn= Robert Haydn is the main antagonist for the first half of the series, and is considered by many to be the strongest power user in the tournament due to his power to turn ideals into reality. Like Ueki he is a celestial, but it was not revealed until after Ueki discovered he was one himself. His power to turn ideals into reality can do anything from making his sacred weapons invincible to creating bubbles that control gravity. His ideal sacred weapons have different properties: His Kurogane always hits the target, his Hood can block any attack, his Mash moves as a two dimensional face along the surface of the ground, and his Pick is a giant drill. However, such a power comes at a price: Each time he uses this power, he sacrifices one year of his lifespan. His Level 2 power is the ability to change the gravity of whatever his ideal objects touch, making them lighter or heavier. He is extremely ruthless and cold, with a deep hatred for humanity. His goal for winning the tournament is to wipe out all of existence. This is due to his unfortunate past in which he was treated as a monster by the people of his town, due to his celestial powers. His only friends were his caretaker and fellow children at the orphanage, who eventually framed him for a theft they committed. After being betrayed by the only people he loved and trusted, he destroyed his hometown with his sacred weapon and grew to hate humanity. After his second battle with Ueki, Robert began to doubt his ways thanks to Ueki's strong sense of justice, thereby forcing his king candidate Margarette to feed him to Hanon, who proceeded to carry out Robert's initial plan using Robert's body as a vessel. At the end of the series Hanon spits out Robert, who accepts Ueki's friendship and discards his goal of world destruction. =Margarette= He is Robert's father and the king candidate who gives him his power. Margarette sends his own son to Earth as a child so that he could choose him for the tournament. He is not above sneaky tactics to ensure his son's victory. Later, he is devoured by an Infernal who steals his appearance with the intention of taking over Heaven. In this new form, he puts Ueki in his awakening organ (It turns out that his clan had eaten a lot of ancient celestial beasts), and advances Ueki to his 9 and 10 star sacred weapons. The Robert's Ten The Robert's Ten is the secret group of ten power users who fight for Robert Haydn. Because that Robert must sacrifice a year of his life whenever he uses his power, he created the Robert's Ten to do the fighting for him and prolong his lifespan. =Kageo Kuroki= Known as Black Shadow, he has the power to turn shadows into clay men. He can create more than one clay man - even altering their appearance - which can confuse the enemy and thus keep them from finding the real Black Shadow. His favorite technique though is to create a giant clay man. If the sun disappears, so does his power. He was the captain of his school basketball team, but after witnessing an enemy team beat up his teammates for defeating them, inflicted serious injuries on the enemy players. An unfair ruling disqualified his team due to this incident, and Black Shadow became the unemotional person who joined ranks with Robert. Ueki luckily got through to him (with the help of Kageo's little brother) and he began to play fair. Because of this Black Shadow was defeated by White Shadow as punishment. =Kamui Rosso= Kamui, nicknamed White Shadow has an ability similar to that of Black Shadow's with the exception that he can change his shadow into a robot, instead of clay men. He has little respect for anyone, adhering to the motto ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need any robots that won‚Äôt listen to me.‚Äù He goes so far as to defeat his own teammate Black Shadow for trying to fight fairly. =Alessio Juliano= He has the power to turn dirt into a scythe. He is very loyal to Robert and will not stand for just anyone to join the group. He is a very short-tempered individual whom Ueki cannot help but irritate. Alessio was shown wearing a pair of blue glasses and a wool hat, and was considered by Robert himself to be one of the weakest members of the Robert's Ten. =Don= Don's power is to turn his ring into a rocket. This ability suited his brute strength, and was used to maximize his punches. Don is very proud of his strength and he always has a huge grin on his face even though he has a very large mean streak to him. Don is easily pleased and flattered when somebody says he is strong, and likes to show off at certain times. In the anime Don has 320 talents, all of brute strength. In the manga Don only has 52 talents, but their strength more than makes up for their number. =Marco Maldini= His power enables him to change tomatoes into magma. This power proved difficult for Ueki to counter, since the magma simply seeped through the trees. An expert chef who is in charge of cooking for the Robert's Ten. He gets very angry when anyone insults his cooking (like Ueki did when he dumped the soup on Alessio's head). Marco is one of the members who considers victory all that matters, nearly killing former teammates Don and Alessio with his magma, and threatening Rinko when she defects. =Ogre= Ogre (Oni in the Japanese version) has the power to change bamboo swords into giant scissors. wears an all black outfit with horns and a forehead protector which is actually a form of chain mail. He doesn't say much, but he is able to defeat most opponents quickly. He is shown easily defeating Kagura (who had the power to change leaves into blades) so quickly that Ueki cannot even see it. =Becky Wolf= Her power is to change BB bullets into meteorites. She was shown using this power effectively against Tenko's barrier. The shortest member of the Ten, she hates to be ignored or being called \\"small\\" or \\"child\\". In spite of her tough appearance, in the Japanese version, she ends most of her sentences with the word, desu. Becky Wolf seems to resemble a cowgirl because of her hat, boots, and BB guns. =Taro Myojin= Myojin was the one who recruited Ueki to join the Robert's Ten. Unlike the other participants in the battle, Taro had two powers given to him by two different king candidates, who both wanted the position of King of the Celestial World. Taro's abilities were to turn a whistle into a laser, and cards (fans in the Japanese version) into buzzsaws. These were often used in conjunction, in his battle with Ueki. The buzzsaw was to simply make the opponent jump, thus making them vulnerable to Taro's laser. Myojin fits the same personality type as most of the other Robert's Ten members, seeing friendship as weakness and showing no mercy. In the Japanese version, he has a speech impediment that often causes him to elongate his pronunciation of the consonant \\"s,\\" but in the American dub he instead appends \\"like\\" to nearly each sentence he utters. Neither of these carries over into the English translation of the manga. =Carpaccio= Carl P. Accio, nicknamed Carpaccio, is Robert's second in command and has the power to copy another person's power. The condition is that he has to spend 24 hours within 10 meters of them. He used this to acquire the powers of all of the other members of the Robert's Ten. He also has two powers from outside the Ten which are the power to change the opponent's thoughts to a cell phone text message and the power to reverse one's position with the opponent's. Carpaccio is a very sneaky (yet ironically loud) type who isn't above underhanded tactics to get what he or Robert wants, such as threatening to kill Inumaru. He is portrayed as somewhat girl-crazy, and says the Robert's Ten should have more girls in it.http://img353.imageshack.us/img353/8200/thelawofueki183xw.jpg =Yunpao= A rotund youth with the power to change electricity to sugar when he opens his eyes open very wide. A replacement member of the Robert's Ten. Utilizes his limiting condition, as when he closes his eyes, the sugar turns back into electricity which can make for a devastating attack. Also, Yunpao uses strange poses to distract his enemies from his large eyes and appears to be quite acrobatic as well. He loves sweets. =Kabara= A hunter with the power to change a cape into wings. He is a replacement member of the Robert's Ten. He can also shoot out the feathers on his wings as he turns them into wing shuriken. He is an expert hunter and is able to shoot pachinko balls with as much power as a rifle bullet (In the manga, he throws kunai instead of pachinko balls). Kabara fits with most of the Robert's Ten because of his cold hunter nature. He felt no qualms about letting Ai suffocate during the Cossack dance battle, and believes that friendship is weakness. He is very fond of showing off his marksmanship skills, even to the point where he will shoot any target in front of him. Due to an exploding Cossack hat during his battle with Ai, he is bald the second time he appears. Due to the nature of his match with Rinko, he develops a fear of cats. =Rinko Jerrard, Kosuke Ueki and Seiichiro Sano= Rinko and Sano were members of the Robert's Ten for different reasons, but they later changed allegiances to Ueki's group. And though Ueki joined only to defeat the Robert's Ten and Robert himself, he was counted as an actual member. See above for more information. Tournament Teams There are five teams that made it to the final round of the tournament to choose the next King of the Celestial World. Other than Ueki's team, there is Team Capucho, Team Grano, Team Marilyn and Team Barrow. There is also Hanon (disguised as Robert) and Li Ho who made it as teams of one each. =Team Capucho= Capucho Leader of Team Capucho who can change his voice into a freezing gas. He has a level 2 power which is a red gas that freezes things and makes them easily shattered. He wants Hideyoshi to join his group so that he can use his own power to send his freezing voice from multiple directions. Tends to get impatient and repeat certain words and phrases. His name is also transcribed as Kapucho and Caption. Mario Mario has the power to change his body into a giant billiard ball. He likes to give his attacks English names that sound absolutely absurd, such as calling his billiard attack Super Dynamic Elegant Ball. This is because the anime states that English is his best subject. Ugo Ugo can change rubber balls into acid. One of the power users that is trying to get Soya to join up with them. He is quite gullible and constantly falls for Soya's tricks, even though he claims he won't be fooled. Soya defeats him by stuffing natt≈ç soybeans down his shirt and squirting wasabi sauce up his nose. Nico Nico can change his hair into a drill. He likes to attack from the ground where he can surprise people. One of the power users that is trying to get Soya to join up with them. He is very vain, especially when it comes to his hair, and also tends to use the word \\"beautiful\\" in his sentences. He looks more like a beautiful girl rather than a boy and has a tendency to wear girlish clothes. Zack Soya's current king candidate who is actually a malicious individual who wants Soya to join his newly formed group to win the tournament. =Team Grano= Grano He is the leader of Team Grano. He has the ability to turn a toy model (even a broken one) into a real life working version. His level 2 power is to control whatever he makes come to life. The condition for this power is that he has to believe whatever he is doing is right. He claims this is easy, because as far as he is concerned, anyone who stands in his way is evil. In the manga, his condition for the power is playing with the toy first. He loves toy models and know about everything related to toys. Seems to put up a nice guy front but is actually quite mean. Pecol He is a very timid individual and has the ability to change photos into toy models. When teamed with Pecol, Grano is unstoppable because he has endless supply of models to use. Pecol once saw his friend getting beaten up, but did nothing to help him because he was too afraid. He longs to be strong, but ends up being duped by Grano. He is later inspired by Ueki to follow his own path towards finding strength. Guitar He is able to turn his clothing into a barrier. His level 2 power is to create a shockwave within the barrier he makes on his opponent, but he cannot use his ability on more than a person at a time. He lied about his power saying he was born invulnerable and that he could change sounds into shockwaves, but that was just to scare his enemies. He loves music, particularly karaoke, but he is not very good at it. He has a tendency to use the word \\"baby.\\" M≈´nin He enjoys traditional poetry and tends to talk in a haiku pattern. He has the power to change bad puns into reality when his opponents laughs. He is also able to turn his power on himself to attack his enemies. He is seen wearing a ratty scarecrow-style hat. Pastello Pastello likes painting and expresses himself through colors like \\"lucky purple\\" and \\"happy pink\\". He can change his line drawings into portals and using his large brush, he can tickle the opponent through the portal, thus making them laugh and become exposed to M≈´nin's word attacks. =Team Marilyn= Marilyn Carrey Marilyn has the ability to stretch one second into ten seconds. She uses this power to make her look like she's using super speed. Her Level 2 power is to double her attack power, but it's only limited to 10 minutes. When she activates it, a gauge appears on her neck and she will collapse after the gauge empties. Marilyn, along with the rest of her team, grew up in a war zone in an unnamed country, so they spent their lives in training. Once the war was over, her family joined the upper class. She claims to be proud of her upbringing and only feel truly alive when she is fighting, but this is a facade. She holds onto a childhood promise to her dead war buddies that forces her to keep fighting, despite her actual distaste for the act. Memory Memory has the power to change blueprints into completed objects. She uses her power with Putting's to make a combination attack. This, however, was taken out temporarily by Hideyoshi blocking her sketch pad with one of his portraits, and the loss of Putting. In her fight with Ai, Memory is forced to fall back on hand-to-hand combat. She is the first victim of Mori's power. A very competent field leader who acts as a spotter from higher ground. She is also the smartest and the strictest of the team. Matthew His power is the ability to change his two arms into six arms. When used with his military weapons, he can hold either six guns or two guns and two bazookas. Matthew is something of a flirt when it comes to ladies and thought Sano's dream was pointless if it didn't include women. Like all the members of Team Marilyn, he just wants to see Marilyn smile. He wears an eyepatch. Baron Baron is a knife user. He has the ability to move to wherever his knife is when he throws it. His level 2 power is to immobilize himself and his opponent to the ground if he teleports within one meter of the person. An honest and naive fellow who always refers to himself in the third person in the Japanese version. This is toned down a little but still existent in the English dub. Baron is very loyal to Marilyn and can be quite gullible because he is tricked by Ueki repeatedly. Putting Putting's power is to change his mouth into a dimensional portal. He uses his power with Memory's to transport materials above the enemy, while she uses her power to change them into traps. He also uses his portal to hold smaller weapons such as grenades. =Team Barrow= Barrow Escarotte The leader of Team Barrow, which consists entirely of celestials. He has the ability to change images from past into current reality and he uses this power in conjunction with his sacred weapons to create endless attacks. He is largely concerned with achieving his goals, throwing aside anything that gets in the way of said objective. Notably, he cannot use any sacred weapons other than Kurogane, Mash, and Gulliver with his power, as all the others are attached to the body. Using his power with them would recreate his past selves, and defeating one of his past selves would defeat him. He has a very sad past because he accidentally used Kurogane on his adoptive mother when he mistakes her as a burglar breaking into their home. She fell into a coma for several years and wakes up terrified when he actually does use his Kurogane on several burglars. At that point, he ran out of their house thinking that he is a monster and joined Robert along with the rest of the team. Ban Dicoot Ban has the ability to change inanimate objects into living beings, usually with adorable faces attached to them. Like his teammates he is a celestial and uses his power to make his sacred weapons sentient. Likes to use the phrase To the max a lot, and is impulsive and aggressive in contrast to his more reserved teammates. He sports a green ducktail hairdo. Like Rinko, he adores all things cute (however tries to act tough to hide it from his enemies), but he is the first person to fall victim to Rinko's \\"evil\\" side for calling her an insect and a small fry. Diegostar A very tall bald man with the ability to turn all things invisible. Like his teammates he is a celestial and uses his power to make his sacred weapons undetectable. He is prone to talks of manliness and wisdom. Kill Norton Like his teammates he is a celestial, but his power was not revealed during the series. Kill Norton has an I.Q. of 179, but strangely, even though he has a high I.Q., he is constantly outsmarted by Ai, implying he's not street smart or very gullible. He named his glasses Bianca after falling in love with them during his fight with Ai. Ai suspects he is a pervert, but he denies these claims. Celestials and King Candidates Celestials dwell in heaven and are ruled by the King of the Celestial World. Each of them are innately capable of awakening up to ten abilities called sacred weapons, beginning with the 1 star and ending with the 10 star weapon: Kurogane (1 star): Generates a cannon that fires an enormous sphere. The first sacred weapon that all celestials automatically acquire from the beginning, and thus the most commonly used. Hood (Fudo in the Japanese version) (2 star): Generates an arm with a shield as defense. Ranma (3 star): Generates a large blade. Mash (Masshu in the Japanese version) (4 star): Generates a box-like set of jaws that chomp on the enemy. Pick (5 star): Elongates a square column towards the enemy. Raika (6 star): Generates skate-like shoes that grant the user super speed. Gulliver (Galiper in the Japanese version) (7 star): Summons a box from a grid on the ground to entrap the opponent. Namihana (8 star): Generates a large whip. Seiku (9 star): Sprouts wings from the user's back. Archenemy (Mao/Satan in the Japanese version) (10 star): The last and most powerful sacred weapon, which few celestials have ever attained. Its exact form varies between individuals, being a manifestation of the user's dreams, its power increasing based on its user's willpower. =The King of the Celestial World= The King of the Celestial World (God in the original Japanese version) is the one who set up the whole tournament. As shown in the anime, the King of the Celestial World is a pervert who likes women and drinking. In a flashback he was inspired to start the tournament due to the actions of Ueki's adoptive mother, Haruko Ueki, who at the time was a high school student just before she was deceased. He started the tournament to give all beings, whether human or celestial, a chance to create their own futures. Although his front is a mindless idiot who likes to slack off, he is actually very wise and powerful. He's considered the best King of the Celestial World in history, which is a fact that he is very proud of. Although he was pierced by Hanon's Ranma and swallowed by him, he survived and managed to restore some of the years to Robert's life that Hanon had used up. =Yodogawa= Yodogawa, nicknamed Yo-chan replaces Kobayashi as Ueki's king candidate. Yo-chan had a deal with another more promising king candidate, Margarette, to get Ueki to lose as soon as possible in order to take a cushy job as his assistant advisor. He does his best to persuade Ueki to quit the tournament, but never succeeds. He rejoins to help Ueki later and apologizes for his previous behavior when Ueki is forming his team. He is at least a level 6 celestial, since in one episode, he used Raika to transport the rest of Team Ueki. For the rest of the series, he is seen either helping Team Ueki or ingratiating himself with Kobayashi and Inumaru. =Pag= A celestial who sent his son, Kosuke Ueki, to Earth as a baby with the same selfish intents as Margarette: to choose his son for the tournament so that he himself could benefit. Unfortunately for him, he was not chosen as a king candidate like Margarette was. He does however seem to express regret when he meets up with Ueki and company later, not revealing his true identity to Ueki due to his shame. Pag also teaches Ueki a way to advance to his level 2 power stating that it would be \\"the first and last time\\" he would aid Ueki. =Lafferty= The king candidate who gave Taira his powers. She tried to cheat during a fight by giving Taira more water and was sent to Hell for it. =Ganju= The king candidate who gave Li Ho his powers. He is also Li Ho's coach, and Li Ho wears a hat that looks like his but with different colors. Not even Ganju himself has seen Li Ho use his powers before. Other power users =Maruo Taira= Taira has the power to change water into fire when he puts it into his mouth. Usually likes to just blast fire, but he can manipulate it by gargling, making it an explosive fireball. He wants the talent to manipulate if he wins. He was Ueki's first fight. =Hayao Adachi= His supernatural power allows him to turn cotton into stakes. Adachi wants to obtain the talent to run because he absolutely loves track but he is not a very good runner. He meets Ueki, who Adachi is envious of for his talent to run, but promises to keep running and maybe even beat him someday. =Li Ho= Li Ho refuses to use his power to turn his hair into a telescoping bat, in favor of using his incredible martial arts skills to defeat his enemies. Li Ho considers Ueki his rival and wants to become a strong fighter in honor of his father, who fell victim to the plague. Originally, he fights Ueki using a move he calls The Count of Monte Cristo ( in the Japanese version) but succumbs to its weakness when Ueki grabs hold of his shoulders. He covers this weakness in round four by rotating his arms and shoulders, but his technique fails once again when Hanon grips onto his head to stop his movement. During the third round, Li Ho displays a distinct growth in power, utilizing his inner power to perform powerful attacks. Channeling his power into his feet, for instance, allows him rapid movement. Li Ho has developed a defense called T'ai chi ch'uan which is a circular strike used to repel any attack. Ueki battles him before facing Marilyn, and learns new ways to use his powers and skills in battle. =Junichi Baba= Junichi Baba, nicknamed B.J. can turn coins into wind. B.J. loves hip-hop music. He has a tendency to lie a lot. Particularly when fighting other power users, he lies that he is Robert Haydn to win through intimidation. His defeat at the real Robert Haydn's hands spurs Ueki to challenge him the first time. He is a pervert especially towards Ai. During Ueki's first battle with him, he maximizes the speed of his whirlwinds to see her underwear and during their second meeting, he rubbed her body which resulted in a punch his face. =Bolo T.= Bolo T can turn his forehead into diamond, which he uses to headbutt his opponents. He can only use this power when his hands are in his pocket, which Ueki takes advantage off by accurately tearing off his pockets. Has many talents which he uses quite skillfully in battle, such as the talents to capture, break tiles, kick rocks, corner, and sew (to repair said pockets). He often incorporates the word \\"jan\\" at the end of his sentences, which is changed to \\"yo\\" in the English dub. =Monjiro Oniyama= Monjiro Oniyama, nicknamed Onimon, has the power to change dirt into iron balls when he kicks them, and he has 299 talents. He believes in fair and square fights and has a tendency to shorten words and phrases. He loves his home village and wants the talent to build in order to build his own village back up. He teaches Ueki some basic fighting techniques to help win the fight against the Black Shadow, the first person Ueki fights from the Robert's Ten. Ueki's family =Gengoro Ueki= Ueki's adoptive father. He is a writer and likes anything weird or unusual. Rather than being shocked or scared at peculiar things, he shouts in excitement, especially when he saw Tenko for the first time ever. He also enjoys sports very much. He often says \\"Reality is Stranger than Fiction!\\" =Shoko Ueki= Ueki's stunningly beautiful adoptive sister, she is a student in a nursing school. She is extremely protective of Ueki, as when she first hears that he has taken part in the tournament, she reacts by complaining about all the bruises and scraped knees he will get, and that she could not bear the thought of him getting hurt. In the series, she likes to play video games, owning a myriad of games along with the PlayStation 2, a Dreamcast and a GameCube consoles. She is very enthusiastic about playing video games with Ai. =Haruko Ueki= Ueki's adoptive mother who died in a car accident the same day that Ueki arrived on Earth. She is the first person the King of the Celestial World meets while on a trip to Earth 25 years ago when he was a newly elected King of the Celestial World and she was a high school student. Her maiden surname is Ueki and she mentions that she has a boyfriend who is a writer, which is also Gengoro's occupation. Her daughter is her spitting image with the exception that Haruko wears her hair in a ponytail. Manga only =Fukusuke Hibiki= Fukusuke Hibiki appeared exclusively in the manga. He pursues Ueki, convinced that he is the fictional \\"tree devil\\" from a children's book he read. The Law of Ueki Plus =Nagara's Laundromat= Kosuke Ueki Job power: the ability to apply on a mop. Unlike in original series where Kosuke Ueki had the power to transform trash into trees and the Sacred Weapons, Ueki starts this series powerless (since he can't use his Sacred Weapons or he would lose his last two talents). He follows Wool to Hangekai and with the help of Nagara he discovers a new power. When the mop is applied with this power, the mop is able to stretch as long as the user pleases. It also can be stretched to turn directions at the user's whim, but it has a restriction; it cannot grab things that the user cannot see. Ueki trains very hard with his power. Later he is able to bend the mop's direction and make in turn into giant hammers to beat people with. The mop seems to have great strength but it can be cut easily. Wool A sheep from Hangekai, who insists he is a dog. He has 3 forms: one where he acts quite human (he can talk and smoke) and the other where he acts like a dog (and only barks), the third form is as known as its original form where Ueki's rainbow coloured mop's pole plug-into the back of Wool and transform into a huge winged-sheep-like creature. But the original form can only be awaken by the recognized mop-holding master of Wool. While in its original form, Ueki can apply his \\"Grab\\" effect on Wool as Wool's indestructible wools can act like Ueki's mop. In human mode, his attitude is similar to a rude uncle. His fur is very defensive and can withstand almost any sort of impact. In order to restore the cube (the lost memories of important people) in his body, he must be taken to a place called \\"MegaSite\\" in Hangekai. Nagara Job power: The ability to apply on an hourglass. A 22-year-old shopkeeper of the Nagara's Laundry Shop. He may be the shopkeeper of the shop, but he is actually very bad at operating washing-machines. He is PLUS's little brother. As a job-power user, he is somewhat strong - every team that participated in the competition always kept an eye on him and his team. In order to help Ueki and achieve his own success, he used the name of the shop to participate in the competition. Nagara's hourglass absorbs the damage that is caused by attackers. The absorbed damage is then gradually displaced on to himself. The more damage that is absorbed, the more volume of healing therapy is stored. He is killed trying to save Ueki, Haiji and Sora after PLUS's attack but is reborn due to his unexplained ability to revive his dead cells. Haiji Job Power: The ability to apply on a washing machine. Age 17. He loves to fight and loves animals- Hence, every time he throws punches or attack moves, he will mention the name of that attack as he has named them after some form of animal. For example, \\"\\" (\\"Red Badger Hundred Floor Punches!\\") or \\"\\" (\\"Scottish 29 ball Punches!\\"), etc. Haiji is Milee's older brother, and ever since their parents had died, they had to live together with Nagara. Haiji has somewhat of a sister complex, and is overly protective of Milee. He can summon a 3 ton, small washing machine on his knuckle as a weapon. The Gun, when applied to the washing machine, gives it an advantage to shoot out water-element shots or beams. Haiji can fire attacks like \\" (\\"Tornado Gun Cannon\\") or \\" (\\"Gun MAX\\"), etc. Milee Milee is Haiji's little sister. She loves animals just like her brother. Watching his brother struggling just to protect her and all the innocent little animals from bullies, she gets upset. At the same time, she is happy because although Haiji was called a bully or spoiled child, she knew that her big brother never wanted to fight back like a bully. All Haiji wanted was to protect her. Sora Job Power: The ability to apply on a hamburger. Sora is a hamburger loving, 14-year-old teenage girl. At times, she acts silly, but she is alert and good at teamwork. She lives in the orphanage's home. Sometimes, she will come to Nagara's laundry shop and play with Milee. She has her own law on burgers: \\"As a good burger-lover, I should punish those other burger- lovers who illegally steal other people's burgers!\\" Whenever she eats a hamburger applied with that power, everything on her doubles: *: Doubles her size and become a tall, powerful giant. *: Doubles her personality, splits into two Sora's without any side effects. *: Doubles her speed, she can run twice as fast. *: Doubles her strength, she is twice as strong. *: Doubles her jumping skills, her jumping length is doubled. *: Her secret move. Allows 2 Sora's to use increased speed at the same time. Sometimes, depending on Sora, it doesn't work well. =Tekurin Finance= Ginzo Job power : the ability to apply on He is an old, big, fat guy that wears glasses. He appears to be the boss of the finance company. He always picks on people that haven't returned the money that they borrowed by increasing the interest. In order to use his power, he must have the foe's permission with their signature on the contract of lending as proof. Then he can borrow all the damage done by the foe on him to attack the foe without receiving any damage. And once the contract is broken, the agreement is broken and if that happens, all of the damage that he had borrowed will be returned to the owner in a blow. It's not perfect, however, as other things can take the damage if put in the attack's path. Shiro Job Power : The ability to apply on A greedy, rich and self-centered guy who work for Ginzo. Everything he owned and bought is always expensive and attractive. He hates people that are not concerned about the attraction of money and people that ruin his appearance, especially his extremely expensive clothes.

He was given orders by Shiro to knock out Haiji. But instead of defeating Haiji, he was defeated by Haiji with his . He and Shiro then realize that his 1 ton, heavy coffer is no match to Haiji's 3 ton, washing machine. =Pitch-Black Hair Salon= Necroman Job-power : The ability to apply \\"Whirl\\"„ÄåÊ∏¶(„Éà„É´„Éç)„Äçon \\"Blowdryer\\"„Äå„Éâ„É©„Ç§„É§„Éº„Äç Age 28.

Early years  Born in Portland, Maine, on October 15, 1815, Hall moved with his family to Harpers Ferry, Virginia, at a young age and attended the local schools there. He attended Yale College, relocated to Missouri in 1840, and was admitted to its bar in 1841.  Political career  Hall was a captain in the American-Mexican War. He served as judge of the Circuit Court in Missouri from 1847 to 1861 and as delegate to the Missouri Constitutional Convention in 1861. That year, he was elected to the 37th Congress as a replacement for John Bullock Clark, who had been expelled from Congress for taking up arms against the United States. He was elected on his own merit in 1862 and served from January 20, 1862 to March 4, 1865. He did not seek an additional term in 1864. In 1855, he was the judge who presided over the trial of Celia, a 19-year-old pregnant slave woman who was on trial for the alleged murder in self-defense of her master, who had been sexually abusing her for years. In response to the defenses' motion that the 1845 law protecting \\"any woman\\" legally entitled Celia to defend herself from a would-be rapist just as a white woman, Hall instructed the jury that a slave had no right to resist her master, even in the case of sexual assault. The jury found Celia guilty and sentenced her to death. He served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1864.  Later years  After his term in Congress ended, Hall returned to the practice of law. Ge died near Darksville, Missouri, on December 15, 1888 and was buried in a family plot.

Their music is inspired by classic progressive rock style of the 1970s and in particular by the music of Genesis. Melody and energy are the main aspects of The Watch music and the live dimension is one of the greatest features of the band. History The band was initially formed in 1997 under the name 'The Night Watch', and consisted of vocalist Simone Rossetti, guitarist Franceso Zago, bassist Antonio Mauri, keyboardist Giovanni Alessi, and drummer Diego Donadio. In this formation the band released their debut album, Twilight, before the line-up collapsed in 2000 leaving only Rossetti to continue the band under the shortened name 'The Watch'. Following the name change, Rossetti rebuilt the band with a line-up that initially consisted of himself, guitarist Ettore Salati, bassist Marco Schembri, keyboardist Gabriele Manzini, and drummer Roberto Leoni, and it is in this formation that the band released their next two albums, 2001's Ghost and 2004's Vacuum. Manzini departed following Vacuum's release and was replaced by longtime band collaborator Sergio Taglioni (who had performed some keyboards on the band's previous two albums), who remained in the band for the fan released Live Bootleg in 2006, as well as the band's fourth studio album, 2007's Primitive, and the band's first official live album in 2008. It was at this point in 2008 that the band underwent its second major line-up change, as once again all of the members with the exception of Rossetti (Leoni, Salati, Schembri, and Taglioni) departed the band, with the new line-up consisting of Rossetti, drummer Marco Fabbri, guitarist Giorgio Gabriel, keyboardist Fabio Mancini, and bassist Cristiano Roversi. Further line-up changes occurred in 2009 when Mancini and Roversi departed the band and were replaced by Valerio De Vittorio and Guglielmo Mariotti respectively. It was at this point that the band once again found stability, and over the following four years would release the Planet Earth? (2010) and Timeless (2011) studio albums, and the Green Show 2011 - Official Live Bootleg (2012) live album. In 2013 the band underwent a further line-up change when Mariotti left the band, and was replaced by Stefano Castrucci, who himself was replaced the following year by Mattia Rossetti, the son of the band's frontman Simone Rossetti. It is this line-up of the band which has produced the band's most recent studio output, in the form of 2014's Tracks from the Alps and 2017's Seven, and continues to exist to this day.

The ship's complement was 484 officers and enlisted men.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 65 Narcissuss main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) Mk V guns, one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on pivot mounts. Her secondary armament was ten BL guns, five on each broadside. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and ten QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, most of which were mounted on the main deck in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457 mm) torpedo tubes: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water. The ship was protected by a waterline compound armour belt thick. It covered the middle of the ship and was high. Because the ship was overweight, the top of the armour belt was below the waterline when she was fully loaded.Friedman, p. 146 The ends of the armour belt were closed off by transverse bulkheads .

After a college course at Nancy, he entered the diocesan seminary there. He was ordained priest on 20 September 1834, then appointed professor of Scripture, and soon afterwards rector of the seminary at Pont-√†-Mousson. At this time he became acquainted with Bautain, Gerbet, Maria Alphonse Ratisbonne, and many other distinguished men, among them Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire. Such was the impression made on him by Lacordaire, that he began to think of entering the Dominican Order. The great preacher proposed to restore it in France, where it had been destroyed by the French Revolution. In 1839 he therefore went to Rome, consulted Pope Gregory XVI on the matter, and finally received the habit on 15 May 1841. Two years afterwards Jandel and Lacordaire commenced the work of re-establishing their order in France. Lacordaire was an orator; Jandel was a ruler of men: calm, grave, sagacious, tenacious of traditions and customs, and pre-eminently practical. Though he had not the genius of his associate, he preached with great results. It is told how a sermon at Lyon on the power of the Cross led to his being challenged by a Freemason to prove the truth of his words in the lodge; he entered it, produced his crucifix, and made the sign of the cross; instantly the lights were extinguished, the furniture was thrown about, and all but he fled in terror from the scene of confusion. Many persons in France placed themselves under his guidance. Pope Pius IX, however, called him to Rome, and made him in 1850 vicar-general of the order ad beneplacitum, and in 1855 general for six years. He was soon recognized as a great religious superior and one of the most enlightened spiritual directors in the city. Of those whom he instructed at this time, two may be mentioned: Cardinal Manning and Father Burke. A born administrator, he infused new life into the order. Several provinces were re-established, and houses opened everywhere. The Dominican nuns (second order) and tertiaries were also indebted to his zeal. He also did much to promote devotion to the rosary and to propagate the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas. Such were the services he rendered to the Holy See especially as regarded the Zouaves, that Pius IX, who was warmly attached to him, intended to make him a cardinal; but he was elected general of the order, on 7 June 1862. He visited Ireland twice, and only weak health prevented him from visiting America. New editions of liturgical books and of the \\"constitutions\\" or legislation formed part of his characteristic work. He also paid great attention to foreign missions. During his term of office sixteen Dominicans were beatified or canonized. He presided at two chapters of the order, and he is considered as one of its greatest generals.

It was a separate municipality but in 1960 became administratively a part of the city of Hav√≠≈ôov built in 1955. It has a population of 21,214 (2010).Statistics of Hav√≠≈ôov It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. It was formerly a village but during the communist era a massive construction of so-called panel√°ks occurred during the construction of a new city of Hav√≠≈ôov, and ≈†umbark was transformed to an urban neighbourhood. Still some old houses remain although the majority of the population of ≈†umbark live in panel√°ks.  Etymology  The name is of German origin (Sch√∂nberg, German: beautiful hill) and was later polonized (not czechized as in Czech berg tends to change into perk, compare: ≈†umperk, Vimperk, etc.).  History  The village was first mentioned in a written document in 1430 as Schomberg. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish probably prior to the 16th century. After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 25 March 1654. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 744 in 1880 to 1,380 in 1910. In 1880 the majority of inhabitants declared speaking Czech language (94.6%), followed by German (23 or 3.1%) and Polish (17 or 2.3%). In the next censuses majority declared speaking Polish (dropping from 98.9% in 1890 to 93.7% in 1910), minority declared speaking Czech (growing from 3 or 0.3% in 1890 to 64 or 4.9% in 1910) and German (growing from 7 or 0.8% in 1890 to 19 or 1.4% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Protestants (50.4%), followed by Roman Catholics (47.9%), Jews (22 or 1.6%) and 2 persons adhering to another faiths. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Lachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

The stories were written by John Tomlinson, with art by Simon Jacob. Fictional character biography Armoured Gideon is a robot created by a race known as The Silent Ones to prevent evil beings escaping from a parallel dimension to that of Earth's. Gideon is armed with a wide variety of weaponry to destroy anything it finds trying to escape the dimension known as \\"The Edge\\". When Gideon attacks, he does so uttering the word \\"Annihilate!\\" In 2018 the character made a surprise return to 2000AD after nearly 25 years in the series \\"The Order\\". Other major characters A counterpart to Gideon was created called Armoured Jerubaal. Jerubaal was meant to carry out the same task as Gideon (using its own catch phrase, \\"Obliterate!\\"), but disabled Gideon to win the favour of their creators, The Silent Ones, by guarding \\"The Edge\\" itself. Jerubaal was however, overcome by the beings inhabiting \\"The Edge\\" and buried on Earth. When it re-emerged in Gideon's debut story, damaged heavily and bent on revenge, Gideon came to Earth and destroyed it. Gideon was pursued and disabled once more by photographer Frank Weitz, once again in the debut story. Beings from \\"The Edge\\" are invisible to photographic film, but Frank is in possession of psychic powers that enable him to capture Gideon's image which spurs him on. His editor rejected his stories, driving Frank to \\"The Edge\\" again where he disables Gideon to take better pictures of the robot but is knocked unconscious and transported back to Earth whilst photographing Gideon before it is completely disabled.

Several Atlantic City casino operators, including Donald Trump, fought the proposal. Trump was fined for not disclosing his lobbying efforts. In January 2008, Dirk Kempthorne, Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior vetoed any Mohawk plans for a casino saying the Mohawk reservation on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border was too far from the track. The casino at the raceway operates under a state license permitting slot machines at designated race tracks. In 2006, the track was the site of the so-called \\"Monticello Miracle\\", in which a racehorse hit World War II veteran Don Karkos in the exact spot where he had received shrapnel and lost sight in one of his eyes during a World War II naval battle.

The duo's history, which spans several bands, encompasses several acquired musical styles that are reflected in Bang Lime's music. Musicians' history Drummer Joules Scott-Key and Guitarist/Vocalist Joshua Winstead met in 1991 while attending school in Denton, Texas. As a newly formed duo, Winstead and Scott-Key played several venues on the Texas Noise rock scene, as well as the underground goth/rock genre in New York City. Later, as the rhythm section for the Canadian new wave/indie quartet Metric, the duo received mass exposure via world tours. This was Scott-Key and Winstead's introduction to a wider spectrum of musical styles that would be heard later in their first Bang Lime album. While still involved with Metric, Winstead and Scott-Key decided to create their own group to continue creating music while not working with their primary ensemble. This ensemble became Bang Lime. The name was inspired by a poem about sex written by Winstead, and chosen by Scott-Key. At present, Bang Lime is based in Oakland, California, where they have further experimented musically with facets of the punk genre. Their musical incarnation to date is described by the duo as an experiment with punk, noise, rock and 1960s blues. Musical attributes The complexity of Bang Lime's sound stems from Winstead's and Scott-Key's exposure to several different genres of music over their years of experience that have been compressed into one conglomerate sound. Although both Winstead and Scott-Key enjoyed playing the repertoire of Metric, when asked about it, Winstead admitted that he had songs that were \\"not in the Metric style and they [had] to come out or [he would] go crazy.\\" Bang Lime's musical style is a departure from that of Metric; according to Winstead, Bang Lime is \\"a little more male driven rock\\" with a \\"heavier\\" sound. Discography Bang Lime released their first album Best Friends In Love on August 14, 2007, on Last Gang Records in New York City. This is the group's only released album. As reviewed by The Tripwire, Best Friends in Love combines \\"the best parts of Death From Above 1979, [mashed together] with a little Electric Six, and [served] with a side order of White Stripes.\\" This conglomeration of sounds is present from the opening track \\"Kings and Queens\\", which is described by The Tripwire as \\"no-frills, grimy indie rock\\" but \\"in a damn good way\\". With the subsequent song \\"The Death of Death\\", a new sound is expressed, one that sounds almost \\"like a stripped down version of Queens Of The Stone Age\\" in terms of Bang Lime's incorporation of \\"fat guitar licks and infectious melodies\\".

Early life Mary Ann Adams was born in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, to William Lewis Adams, a lawyer, and Agatha Strother (Lewis) Adams. Her maternal grandmother was a cousin of James Madison, while her father's family had founded Lynchburg, Virginia. Her parents lived along the James River in Virginia, where her father exported flour and tobacco. During the War of 1812 her father left Virginia for what is now Alabama and bought a plantation near the site of Tuscaloosa. While purchasing supplies in Mobile, Robert Adams answered Andrew Jackson's call for volunteers to help defend New Orleans and raised a company which he led at the Battle of New Orleans.Marks (1989), p. 64. In 1816, her mother came to live permanently in Alabama as well. In Alabama, Robert Adams practiced law, and in 1827 he served as an agent of U.S. Treasury Department. He died in June 1827, leaving his widow to raise their six surviving children, all under the age of 12.Marks (1989), p. 65. Mary attended boarding school in Tuscaloosa to meet her father's wish that his children be appropriately educated.Marks (1989), p. 66. On August 4, 1836, Mary Adams married Samuel Augustus Maverick, a Yale graduate who had been the Alamo garrison's delegate to the Convention of 1836 declaring Texas' independence from Mexico.Marks (1989), pp. 53-54. Sam Maverick sold his Alabama plantation at the beginning of 1837, and Mary Maverick accompanied her husband to New Orleans so that he could conduct business and be closer to news of Texas. While she was in New Orleans, her brother William Adams left for Texas.Marks (1989), p. 69. In March 1837, she and her husband visited his father in South Carolina, where they refused the elder Maverick's gift of his plantation. On May 14, 1837, she gave birth to her first child, Samuel Maverick, Jr. in South Carolina.Marks (1989), p. 70. Establishment in San Antonio In 1838, Maverick drew this sketch of the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Bexar. In October 1837, Mary Maverick, her brother, son, and seven slaves left South Carolina. After a brief stop in Tuscaloosa, they left for the Republic of Texas on December 7, accompanied by her fifteen-year-old brother, Robert Adams, and three additional slaves. The party crossed into Texas near New Year's Day 1838.Marks (1989), p. 71. On February 4, they rented rooms at the home of George Sutherland, and for four months Maverick remained there while her husband continued on to San Antonio.Marks (1989), p. 72. Maverick and the rest of her party reached San Antonio on June 15, 1838.Marks (1989), p. 78. In her memoirs, she claims to have been the first U.S.-born female to settle in San Antonio, but letters to her mother mentioned another American lady, married to an Irishman, who died shortly after the Mavericks arrived. The family rented rooms at the same home where her brother William resided.Marks (1989), p. 80. Shortly after moving into a new home along the San Antonio River, Maverick gave birth to her second child, Lewis Antonio Maverick, who became the first Anglo-American child to be born in and grow up in San Antonio.Marks (1989), p. 85. During the next few years, more Anglo families moved to San Antonio.Marks (1989), p. 86. Her brothers returned to Alabama, but William came back to Texas in 1839 with another brother, Andrew, to begin farming.Marks (1989), p. 87. Mary was often left alone, as her husband spent months traveling for business or combing the Texas wilderness on surveying missions. The Mavericks participated in the so- called Council House Fight on March 19, 1840 when half of a peace-delegation of sixty-five Comanches, consisting of men, women and children, was slaughtered and the other half taken hostage. The Comanche delegation arrived in San Antonio, a traditional safe haven for peace talks, to negotiate a peace treaty and a demarcation line and bargain for the ransom of white captives. The army had ordered prior to the meeting that, if not all Anglo-Texans believed to be Comanche captives at that time were returned at the beginning of the talks, all the negotiators of the band be held until the captives were returned, and then the ransom would be paid.Marks (1989), pp.90-91. Maverick and a female neighbor had been watching several Indian children playing when they heard gunfire within the council house and saw Indians fleeing from the building. She alerted her husband and brother Andrew, and, while Samuel Maverick rushed outside to chase down the Indians, Maverick and Andrew hurried outside to find the children. They discovered three of the fugitive Indians in the back yard, while their slave cook, Jinny, tried to protect the two Maverick children and her own four children by threatening the Indians with a large rock. Andrew Adams shot two of the three Indians and joined the main fight. Maverick hid her children in the house and watched the battle through the windows. At one point she was curious enough to go outside for a closer look, but was ordered to return indoors by a soldier. The skirmish continued until all of the Indians were dead or captured.Marks (1989), p. 91. In her diary, Maverick wrote that \\"'All [Indians] had a chance to surrender ... and every one who offered or agreed to give up was taken prisoner and protected.'\\"Marks (1989), p. 92. Two days after the battle, Samuel Maverick again left his wife and children alone, under the protection of her two brothers.Marks (1989), p, 93. During his business trip, Sam sold many of his lands in South Carolina and Alabama, and bought two years worth of provisions, which he had shipped to Linville, Texas. Before he could escort the goods on to San Antonio, Linville was raided by a party led by Buffalo Hump, during the Great Raid of 1840, and all of their provisions were destroyed.Marks (1989), p. 95. In December 1840, Maverick's aunt and uncle, John and Ann Bradley, arrived in Texas from Alabama along with their young children. Happy to be surrounded by family again, Maverick expanded her own family in April 1841 with the birth of her daughter Agatha.Marks (1989), p. 97. Later that year, Maverick's mother, Agatha Adams, planned a journey to visit them and to consider settling in Texas. She fell ill days before she was scheduled to leave, however, and died on October 2.Marks (1989), p. 98. Runaway of '42 The citizens of San Antonio received word in February 1842 that Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna was again sending troops into Texas, which Mexico still did not recognize as a separate country. The Mavericks left some of their possessions with Mexican neighbors and joined their other Anglo neighbors in the Runaway of '42. With her brothers William and Andrew, Maverick and her immediate family travelled east, the first time Maverick had left San Antonio since her arrival.Marks (1989), p. 100. For several days, she and the children boarded with a rancher outside of Seguin while her husband and brothers returned to San Antonio to fight. On March 6, the sixth anniversary of the fall of the Alamo, Maverick received word that San Antonio had fallen to Santa Anna. She worried about her men for several days until they appeared, having turned back before reaching San Antonio. The Mavericks moved on to Gonzales, where they squatted in a house left empty when its residents had fled in the Runaway.Marks (1989), p. 101. The men accompanied Texas army troops to retake San Antonio, and the Mexican army retreated without a fight, although they caused a great deal of damage to the homes of American citizens. Samuel Maverick returned to his wife and moved her to LaGrange so that she would be farther from the threat of Indian attacks. On April 30 he left Maverick alone there while he returned to Alabama to get her younger sister, Elizabeth, who had been living as a boarder since her mother died the previous year.Marks (1989), p. 102. Samuel Maverick returned to San Antonio without his family in late August 1842 to argue a case before the district court. The Mexican army, under General Adrian Woll, surrounded San Antonio and captured the small number of Anglo-American men in the city.Marks (1989), p. 104. On September 15, Samuel Maverick and his countrymen were forced to march toward Mexico. Mary Maverick's brothers participated in the Battle of the Salado on September 18, where their company ambushed some of the Mexican soldiers, killing 60 of them. Her uncle John Bradley joined another company, and Maverick sent her slave Griffin to go with him. She instructed Griffin to pose as a runaway slave bound for Mexico in the hope that he would be able to help free Samuel Maverick. As an extra assurance, she gave Griffin funds that could be used to ransom back her husband. This band of Texans was surprised by a Mexican cavalry detachment.Marks (1989), p. 106. Griffin was killed in the battle, and Bradley was taken captive and marched to join Samuel Maverick and the other prisoners.Marks (1989), p. 107. Maverick continued to receive letters from her husband during his captivity, so that she could be comforted that he was still alive.Marks (1989), p. 108. Other Mary Maverick bore ten children over a span of 21 years. Four died of illness before the age of eight, which led Mary to seek solace in the spiritualism which was increasingly popular in mid-19th-century America. As her surviving children grew up, she became active in the public sphere. During the Civil War, while four of her sons served in the Confederate States Army, she was active in San Antonio relief efforts. Her memoirs relate her attempts to revive the then-dying art of homespun cloth production to supply the needs of the Confederate cause. A devout Episcopalian, she was instrumental in establishing St. Mark's Church in San Antonio and served as president of the Ladies' Parish Aid Society. Later life After Sam's death in 1870, as San Antonio grew, Mary Maverick made efforts to see that the pioneer past was not forgotten. She was a prominent member of the San Antonio Historical Society and the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. She helped promote the annual Battle of Flowers celebration, and devoted effort to the restoration and preservation of the Alamo as an historic site. Her watercolor sketch of the Alamo, completed during her first residence in San Antonio, is one of the earliest-known depictions after the battle. Although she did not herself immigrate to Texas until two years after the fall of the Alamo, in 1889 she wrote a brief account of the battle based on the recollections of witnesses. She died on February 24, 1898, and was buried beside her husband at San Antonio City Cemetery Number 1.Handbook of Texas Online Memoirs Throughout her life, Mary had kept diaries of her experiences. In 1895, with the help of her son George Madison Maverick, she published these as her memoirs. They provide an engrossing and vivid picture of life on the Texas frontier and mid-19th-century San Antonio, including household management, child-rearing and family life, medical practices, and social and political observations. Mary Maverick's writings, in particular her eyewitness account of the Council House Fight in San Antonio in 1840, are often cited in studies of Texas pioneer life. In particular, she claimed that Matilda Lockhart, the white captive who was returned by the Comanches to white authorities on that day, had been beaten, raped and had suffered burns to her body. Allegedly, her face was severely disfigured, with her nose entirely burned away, a detail which has been commonly included in Texas history descriptions of the incident since the publications of the Maverick memoirs in 1895. Reports of abuse are, however, conspicuously missing in primary documents authored by eyewitnesses immediately after the event. Neither Col. Hugh McLeod mentioned any abuse in his report of March 20, 1840 (commenting on the intelligence of the girl but nothing like a missing nose), nor any other Texas officials at the time nor Matilda Lockhart's own sister-in-law, who was in San Antonio, in a letter written to her own mother shortly after the release. Anderson writes: \\"While published in the 1890s, this description has been used by historians to claim that the massacre came about as a result of the justifiable rage of Texas men. Yet none of the Texas officials claimed this to be the case at the time; evidence of abuse is conspicuously missing in the primary documents, however no reliable narrative counters it. Maverick may have exaggerated Lockhart's condition because of the growing criticism of Texas in the American and European Press. The most significant source on Matilda's condition is a brief statement made in a letter by her sister-in-law, Catherine Lockhart, who was in San Antonio. Catherine describes Matilda's release but says nothing of abuse.\\"Anderson(2005) pp. 181 f. Footnotes References * * Memoirs of Mary A. Maverick, Rena Maverick Green, ed.

The station, which was previously part of the East Lincolnshire Railway, closed in 1961 to passengers and 1964 to freight, but was taken over by the preservation society in 1984. The first trains from the station to , to the north, ran in August 2009, the first for 47 years. There are proposals to extend the line further in both directions towards and Louth. History The station was opened on 28 March 1848 and was originally named Ludborough for Fulstow although the for Fulstow was later dropped. Although its name is taken from the Lincolnshire village of Ludborough, the station is in fact situated halfway between that village and Fulstow. It was constructed by contractor John Waring and Sons of Rotherham who, in December 1846, had agreed to construct the line between and for the sum of ¬£46,102 (). The architects of the station buildings were John Grey Weightman and Matthew Ellison Hadfield of Sheffield. Ludborough, some from Louth, was provided with staggered platforms either side of a level crossing; the up platform to the south of the crossing and the up to the north. A third lower platform was later added in connection with the rail motor service introduced from 1905. Situated opposite the up platform, the rail motor platform is adjacent to a brick stationmaster's house which also comprised the booking office and passenger waiting room. The architectural style of the house and the station layout is similar to the stations at , and . A signal box on the up platform which contained a 20 lever frame controlled the crossing gates as well as access to the small goods yard with two sidings on the opposite side. Ludborough had the most comprehensive goods facilities on the line between Louth and Grimsby, having cattle pens and a large brick goods shed; one siding ran into a loading dock behind the down platform. The design of the shed is based on the warehouse built by the Louth Navigation at Austen Fen. The station closed to passengers on 11 September 1961, the same day as and to the south and and to the north. This made the only intermediate station open between Louth and Grimsby . It closed completely on 25 May 1964 when goods facilities were withdrawn.After the closure of the line to passengers in 1970, the down line was removed between Louth and Hainton Street leaving only the up line through Ludborough to remain open until December 1980. Preservation and reopening In 1978, the Grimsby-Louth Rail Group was formed with the aim of reintroducing a service between Grimsby and Louth. They were unsuccessful in saving the line intact. After BR ripped up the track and destroyed all the buildings the group decided to rename themselves the Grimsby-Louth Railway preservation society. The society focussed their efforts into restoring the two sole remaining signalboxes on the line: Hainton street in Grimsby and Louth North. Both these boxes were left behind by BR as they had gate wheels in them which made it easier to operate the crossing gates for the last few years. Both the boxes suffered severe vandalism. In 1984, the Society took a lease from British Rail of Ludborough station site which became its base. A new company was formed with the intention of buying the remains of the track bed as BR would not sell to a society at that time. The new company was called the Great Northern and East Lincolnshire railway company plc. On 28 September 1991, the company Great Northern and East Lincolnshire Railway co plc obtained a Light Railway Order authorising the reinstatement of the East Lincolnshire Railway between and the former Keddington Road level crossing near Louth, which would include the line through Ludborough. The signal box at Hainton street was destroyed by fire in the early 1990s. The frame and the gate wheel were removed and placed into storage at Ludborough ready for re- use. The frame is now in use as Ludborough's frame. The wheel is also in Ludborough box but will never be used in this location. Louth North was restored by the society but suffered continual vandalism. The box is a grade II listed structure and has been converted into a house but still retains its signal box look. With the order in place, this allowed the company to acquire track, locos and rolling stock with the society supporting the company as much as it can. The company (now trading as the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway) have had to rebuild all of the station's facilities, including a replica Great Northern signal box in its original position, a two-road locomotive shed and a passenger waiting room which houses a museum and shop. In 1997 the level crossing was relaid and allowed access over the road for the railway to bring rolling stock that had been stored on the north side of the crossing. Between 2001 and 2004, the north (down) platform was developed with a toilet block, garden and running in board. By this point, the track extended north for a distance of ¬æ of a mile. A major step for the LWR came in 2004 when HMRI approved the signalling for use. This then enabled the railway to run trains in the dark for the first time at Hallow'een. Tracklaying reached North Thoresby in 2008 and the first train for 47 years between the two stations ran on 26 August 2009. The Lincolnshire Wolds Railway plans to extend the line in both directions to Louth via Utterby and Fotherby and via Grainsby to the former Holton-le-Clay station, recreating 8 miles between Holton Le Clay and Louth. The trackbed through to Waltham has been built over at Waltham and Holton Village halt and thus making it impossible to rebuild the railway to Waltham. The stationmaster's house has survived and is available as a holiday let. The goods shed also remains, but is in private ownership. References Sources   External links * Ludborough on navigable O.

The term of office for Texas constables is four years. However, when vacancies arise, the commissioner's court of the respective county has the authority to appoint a replacement to serve out the remaining term. If no person is elected and qualified under law to fill an office of constable for seven consecutive years, the respective commissioner's court may declare the office dormant and it may not be filled by election or appointment. However, the commissioner's court may reinstate the office by a majority vote or by calling an election where a majority of precinct voters approve it. Authority In Texas, constables and their deputies are fully empowered peace officers with county-wide jurisdiction and thus, may legally exercise their authority in any precinct within their county. However, some constables‚Äô offices limit themselves to providing law enforcement services only to their respective precinct, except in the case of serving civil and criminal process. Constables and their deputies may serve civil process in any precinct in their county and any contiguous county and can serve arrest warrants anywhere in the state. The duties of a Texas constable generally include providing bailiffs for the justice of the peace court(s) within his precinct and serving process issued there and from any other court. Moreover, some constables‚Äô offices limit themselves to only these activities but others provide patrol, investigative, and security services as well. The Constable's authority considerably overlaps with that of the County Sheriff, especially with respect to serving civil documents as well as criminal warrants.https://www.county.org/About-Texas-Counties/%E2%80%8BAbout-Texas- County-Officials/%E2%80%8BTexas-County-Sheriff RET. September 06, 2018 17:22 CST On April 13, 2018, the Texas Supreme Court held that deputy constables fall within the definition of \\"police officers\\" and are, as such, entitled to engage in collective bargaining with their public employers under Local Government Code chapter 174. Strength In 2000, there were 2,630 full-time deputies and 418 reserve deputies working for the 760 constables‚Äô offices in Texas. Of this number, 35% were primarily assigned to patrol, 33% to serving process, 12% to court security, and 7% to criminal investigations. The Harris County Precinct 4 and 5 Constables‚Äô Offices are the largest constables‚Äô offices in Texas with over 500 deputies each. New constable qualifications Constable qualifications as changed by HB 1588 of the 79th Regular Session of the Texas Legislature: Local Government Code 86.0021 (Qualifications; Removal) *(a) A person is not eligible to serve as constable unless: **(1) the person is eligible to be licensed under Sections 1701.309 and 1701.312, Occupations Code, and: ***(A) has at least an associate degree conferred by an institution of higher education accredited by an accrediting organization recognized by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board; ***(B) is a special investigator under Article 2.122(a), Code of Criminal Procedure; or ***(C) is an honorably retired peace officer or honorably retired federal criminal investigator who holds a certificate of proficiency issued under Section 1701.357, Occupations Code; or **(2) the person is an active or inactive licensed peace officer under Chapter 1701, Occupations Code. *(b) On or before the 270th day after the date a constable takes office, the constable shall provide, to the commissioners court of the county in which the constable serves, evidence that the constable has been issued a permanent peace officer license under Chapter 1701, Occupations Code. A constable who fails to provide evidence of licensure under this subsection or who fails to maintain a permanent license while serving in office forfeits the office and is subject to removal in a quo warranto proceeding under Chapter 66, Civil Practice and Remedies Code. *(c) The license requirement of Subsection (b) supersedes the license requirement of Section 1701.302, Occupations Code. Grounds for removal include the failure to present permanent peace officer license on or before the 270th day after taking office. He can also be removed if he was convicted of a felony crime and a misdemeanor charge of official misconduct, in addition to incompetence and intoxication. History On March 5, 1823, John Tumlinson Sr., the first alcalde of the Colorado district of the Old 300 of Stephen Fuller Austin's colony, is considered by many Texas Ranger historians to be the first Texas Ranger killed in the line of duty.[Transactions, Texas Lodge of Research, Captain Peter F. Tumlinson: Texian Ranger and Mason. Doyle, Brett Laird XXXIX (2004-2005) 83-91.] He wrote to the Baron de Bastrop in San Antonio that he had \\"appointed but one officer who acts in the capacity of constable to summon witnesses and bring offenders to justice.\\" That appointee, Thomas V. Alley, thus became the first Anglo law enforcement officer in the future republic and state of Texas. Other prominent colonists who served as constable included John Austin and James Strange. The Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1836) provided for the election in each county of a sheriff and \\"a sufficient number of constables.\\" During the ten years of the republic's existence, thirty-eight constables were elected in twelve counties, the first in Nacogdoches County and the largest number (thirteen) in Harrisburg (later Harris) County. Court records indicate that violent crime was rare in the republic, except when horse or cattle thieves entered Texas from Arkansas or Louisiana; most indictments were for nonlethal crimes such as illegal gambling or assaults resulting from fights or scuffles. Juan N. Segu√≠n and Elliott M. Millican both served as constables during the republic. Shortly after Texas became a state, an act passed by the legislature specified that the constable should be \\"the conservator of the peace throughout the county,\\" adding that \\"it shall be his duty to suppress all riots, routs, affrays, fighting, and unlawful assemblies, and he shall keep the peace, and shall cause all offenders to be arrested, and taken before some justice of the peace.\\" Constables were the most active law-enforcement officials in many counties during the early statehood of Texas. After Texas seceded from the United States in 1861, many county offices, including that of constable, remained unfilled or were filled by men less competent than their predecessors. During the military occupation of Texas after the Civil War, the election of county officials all but ceased, as the Union military appointed more than 200 individuals to state and county offices. A number of these appointees refused to serve; from 1865 to 1869, over one-third of the county offices in Texas were vacant. Many counties had no appointed or elected constables during this period. Austin, DeWitt, Fayette, McLennan, and Navarro counties had but a single constable each, appointed by Gen. Edward R. S. Canby, head of the Fifth Military District, in 1868-69. Under the Constitution of 1869, a Reconstruction document that centralized many governmental functions, no constables were elected in Texas from 1869 to 1872, though some were appointed by justices of the peace. Many of these appointees lacked experience in handling violent offenders and access to secure jail facilities, and had few deputies to call upon for assistance. They were no match for the poor, embittered, and heavily armed former soldiers from both sides who roamed the state, often turning to crime. As a result, the office of constable began to diminish in importance, and the better-equipped county sheriffs began to assume a leading role in law enforcement. Still, a number of prominent Texas peace officers of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries began their careers as constables or deputy constables, including Thomas R. Hickman, George A. Scarborough, and Jess Sweeten. In 1896, while serving as a United States deputy marshal, Scarborough shot and killed the controversial El Paso constable John Selman, who had himself gunned down the notorious John Wesley Hardin in 1895. The Constitution of 1876, designed to decentralize control of the state government, reduced the power of many state officials and mandated that constables would once again be elected at the precinct level. A 1954 constitutional amendment extended their term of office from two years to four. Today, constables numbering approximately 780 are elected from precincts in most Texas counties. Their law-enforcement roles vary widely, but in general their police powers are no different from those of other peace officers in the state. Complete records do not exist, but the most recent estimate is that at least ninety-three Texas constables have died in the line of duty, including sixty-seven in the twentieth century. In some Texas counties, the constable position remains unfilled for several years and this is attributed to several factors such as the refusal of people appointed to the job. In 2002, an amendment to the Texas Constitution was approved since this was the only way to abolish these seats. The change allows a commissioners' court to abolish a constable office that has been vacant for seven years. The court can also restore it or by voter approval. Constable's jurisdiction The constable's original jurisdiction covers the county of election but also the entire state in most criminal and civil matters. Constables may make a warrantless arrest for any offense committed in their presence or view anywhere in Texas, except for offenses under Texas Transportation Code, Title 7, Subtitle C, which covers most moving traffic violations.Texas Code of Criminal Procedure 14.03(g)(1) However, they may enforce all state and local laws while in their county, including traffic offenses. Constables may serve arrest warrants anywhere in Texas. There is a popular misconception in Texas that a constable is the only official that can arrest a sitting sheriff or governor. However, a constable is not the only official with the power to arrest a sheriff or governor. There is no statute that grants those officials immunity from arrest. Notes *1. Precinct boundaries are set by the County Commissioners Court. See Texas Local Government Code ¬ß81.021 and based on population. There are two to eight precincts per Texas county. *2. Constables (and the justice of the peace, and county commissioners) are elected by these precincts and they must provide bailiffs for the Justice Court(s) in their precinct. *3. They can also serve civil process in any precinct in their county and any contiguous county to their home county. See Texas Local Government Code ¬ß86.021. *4. Moreover, they can serve warrants throughout the state. See Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 15.06. *5. Furthermore, their jurisdiction to arrest, without warrant, extends throughout the county, where they have full arrest powers. See Texas Local Government Code ¬ß86.021 and Texas Attorney General's Opinion GA-0189. *6. They also have full arrest powers outside of their jurisdiction, while in the state, except for certain traffic violations. See Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 14.03(g). Finally, constables and their deputies in Texas are official, certified Texas law-enforcement officers. Constables and their deputies must graduate from a state-certified law enforcement academy. All peace officers in Texas are trained to the same state requirement. Constables also have identical powers of arrest as county sheriffs and their deputies. In the Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, 2000, which was published by the US DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics, it was noted that there were 2,630 full-time, sworn constables/deputy constables in Texas. Recent figures cite the number to around 3,500 and these include clerical and other personnel. Of this number, 35% of constables/deputy constables were primarily assigned to patrol duties. For example, in Harris County Precinct 4 and 5 (Greater Houston area), there are over 1400 patrol deputies. Additionally, 15% handled criminal investigations, i.e. they are detectives and investigators. Also, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE) the regulatory agency for all peace officers in Texas (sheriffs, constables, security police, police officers and marshals) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice considers the Texas constable to be a unique peace officer position.

Emberiza sulphurata MHNT The yellow bunting or Japanese yellow bunting (Emberiza sulphurata) is a passerine bird of eastern Asia in the bunting family Emberizidae. It is 14 cm long and has a conical, grey bill, pinkish-brown feet and brown eyes. The male is grey-green above with black streaks on the back. The underparts are yellow-green (brightest on the throat and belly) with streaks on the flanks. It has black lores, a narrow black chin, a pale eye ring and white outer tail feathers. There are two bars on the wing, formed by pale tips to the median and greater wing coverts. The female is similar to the male but paler without the black on the lores and chin. The species has a twittering song and a soft ' call. The breeding season lasts from mid-May to early July. The nest is built low in a bush and three to five eggs are laid. The yellow bunting breeds only in Japan where it is uncommon. It is found mainly on the largest island Honshu but may also breed on Kyushu and possibly bred on Hokkaido in the past. It occurs in forest and woodland between 600 and 1500 metres above sea level, mainly in the central and northern parts of Honsh≈´. A few birds winter in the warmer regions of Japan but most migrate further south. It has been recorded from the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong and south-east China at this season but is scarce everywhere. It occurs in woodland, scrub, grassland and farmland during winter. Small numbers pass through Korea on spring and autumn migration. The total population of the yellow bunting is small and decreasing and the species is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. It is threatened by habitat loss, the use of pesticides and trapping for the cagebird industry. References *BirdLife International (2007) Species factsheet: Emberiza sulphurata.

The route runs from PA 841 in West Marlborough Township to U.S. Route 322 Business (US 322 Bus.) in downtown West Chester. PA 842 runs through rural areas with some development between PA 841 and West Chester as a two- lane undivided road. Along this stretch, the route forms a concurrency with PA 82 in Unionville, where it intersects the western terminus of PA 162. In West Chester, PA 842 is routed along one-way streets. PA 842 was first designated by 1928 between PA 82 in Unionville and US 122/PA 5/PA 62 in West Chester. The route was extended west to PA 841 in 1937. Route description PA 842 westbound past Brandywine Street in West Chester PA 842 begins at an intersection with PA 841 in West Marlborough Township, Chester County, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Upland Road. The road passes through farmland and woodland, curving to the east. The route continues through rural areas and crosses Newark Road, becoming the border between East Marlborough Township to the north and West Marlborough Township to the south before fully entering East Marlborough Township. PA 842 curves northeast andf reaches an intersection with PA 82, where it turns east to form a concurrency with that route on Doe Run Road.

Her voice has appeared as backup vocals for artists such as Kings of Leon, The Good, the Bad & the Queen, Razorlight, Boy George and the Spice Girls, as the featured vocalist on big screen productions such as Dark City, and more recently as the singer and songwriter for a series of successful dance projects. Since 2009 she has worked as a cat behaviour consultant.  Music career  Kelsey appeared on the dance scene in 1997. She won the UK's MOBO Award for her first album on Dorado Records with the UK garage act Sunship. Her next single, \\"Try Me Out\\" from the second Sunship album, became a UK club hit and was an Agia Napa anthem of 2001. Kelsey also worked on two of Dorado label-mate Matt Cooper's Outside albums, penning the singles \\"If You Come with Me\\" and \\"Somewhere New\\". In 1998, film composer Trevor Jones asked Kelsey to perform on the soundtrack to sci-fi cult film Dark City. This resulted in American actress Jennifer Connelly miming to Kelsey's voice in two prominent scenes as well as the Kelsey rendition of \\"Sway\\" being featured on the end credits. (The director's cut of Dark City uses Connelly's vocals both in the film and the version in the credits.) The tracks \\"Sway\\" and \\"The Night Has 1000 Eyes\\" were included on the film's soundtrack, released on TVT Sountrax. Other major films featuring Kelsey's voice include Bring Me the Head of Mavis Davis and Merlin. More success came in 2002 for Kelsey's work with D*Note's \\"Shed My Skin\\". During that same year, she appeared in the opening scenes of the horror movie Long Time Dead in which she participates in a ouija board s√©ance just before dying a horrific death. In 2004, Kelsey signed to BMG Music Publishing. In 2005, Markus Schulz teamed up with Kelsey to release the single \\"First Time\\" on Armada Music in the Netherlands. This led to the track being included on Schulz' debut album Without You Near, on which she sang on a second track, \\"Travelling Light\\". Schulz' second album, Progression (released 2007) featured a new collaboration with Kelsey, \\"On a Wave\\". In 2006, Kelsey was approached by dance producer TTLC, also known as TDR (Tom de Ridder), to collaborate on electro track \\"Never Ever\\". This track was released by Belgian label Mostiko and has culminated in DJs such as Judge Jules and Sasha championing the Filterheadz remix (live and on their weekly shows on BBC Radio 1), as well as the Housetrap mix receiving heavy air rotation on Belgian national radio. Kelsey also co-wrote Virgin Records's Lost Witness singles \\"Home\\" and \\"Coming Down\\", performed by Tiff Lacey. \\"Falling\\", co-written with First State, was included on Tiesto's In Search of Sunrise 6: Ibiza. A collaboration, \\"Wicked World\\", with Dutch production duo Hardsoul resulted in the track being picked up by Fedde Le Grande to remix for his debut album, Sessions, released on Ministry of Sound in 2007. In 2010, she collaborated with producer Stonebridge and released a single called \\"Rescue Me\\".  Later life  Kelsey changed her career in 2009 and studied to become a cat behaviourist. She runs a cat behaviour consultancy in London's Notting Hill after leaving Middlesex University with a first class honours degree in Feline Behaviour & Psychology. She is believed to be the first person in the UK to be awarded a first class degree in this field. In July 2016 she was awarded the Gerry Fowler prize by Middlesex University, for outstanding work in her studies and chosen field. She is a member of the Canine and Feline Behaviour Association (CFBA). She also writes for various cat related magazines including Your Cat as well as online pet magazine Style Tails and UK cat blog Katzenworld. Her book Claws: Confessions of a Cat Groomer, was published by John Blake in September 2017.

Ofinran was then made king in a foreign land and joined his host in expeditions around the Niger River and the two communities co-existed. However, the favorable treatment of the Oyos in Borgu was short-lived. Hostilities soon emerged and Ofinran and his men decided to leave for a town called Kusu. In the process of their ill luck of being driven away from their original homes, they may have believed their problems was due to the unfavorable disposition they originally had towards the If√° deity. While in Kusu they embraced the If√° divinity and called for a man named Alado to initiate the Alafin and his subjects in order to wade away any ill wind related to their original rejection of If√°. Also, according to Oyo fables, it was during this period that the Egungun festivities also emerged in Yoruba land. It was thought that the Egungun priest followed the Yorubas from Borgu into Kusu.

The fleet's frequent destination was the salt manufacturing lands of the Bay of Bourgneuf, which they duly plundered. In 1449, a fleet organised by Henry VI to keep the Channel free of pirates, turned to piracy themselves under the charge of Robert Winnington, attacking the Bay fleet in an unprovoked peace time assault. Sixty Hanseatic ships and fifty ships from the Low countries were taken by the privateers to the Isle of Wight, released only after diplomatic pressure. Appearing crown-sanctioned, the attack sparked outrage amongst the Hanseatic League and a period of reprisals occurred. Most importantly, English goods (significantly wool) were now excluded from the continental markets. This had severe consequences for a country with an increasingly large and powerful merchant class who relied on trade with the continent. It could also be argued that the effects permeated throughout society, with 2/3 of wool being produced by peasants who must have suffered from the lack of foreign demand. The attack on the Bay Fleet came at a time of English foreign policy setbacks on the continent, culminating in Charles VII's entry into Normandy in 1459‚Äì60. The attack is an example of how English foreign policy resulted in domestic discontent at the poor governance of the King's Council. This was a major factor for Jack Cade's Revolt of 1450. A letter describing the attack on the Bay Fleet was written by Robert Winnington to Thomas Daniel on 25 May 1449.

The empire of which she ruled is located in what is modern day western and north-central Nigeria. History Orompoto was the sister of her predecessor, Eguguojo. She became the first woman to become \\"king\\" of the Oyo in the imperial era, and the first woman since the pre-imperial ruler Yeyeori. Orompoto assumed the throne because there was no male successor within her family at the time. She helped drive the Nupe from Oyo in 1555. Orompoto lived in the 16th-century. Orompto was the second Oyo monarch to reign in the new capital of Igboho. Some traditions of the oral record hold that she was miraculously transformed into a man before assuming the throne there. Orompoto used horses extensively in military battles and may have obtained them from Borgu. She was reportedly masterfully skilled on horseback, and created a specialized order of cavalry officers within her army that were subject to the Eso Ikoyi. The first of its kind, the cavalry was a force to be reckoned with in the various wars with Oyo's enemies. Considered a skillful warrior herself, she is said to have distinguished herself at the battle of Illayi. While fighting her enemies there, she lost three war chiefs in quick succession, titleholders that are known as Gbonkas in Oyo. The third of them is believed to have fallen with his face locked in an unnerving grin. The enemies thought that he was still alive and was making a mocking gesture, and were overwhelmed by what they considered to be their inability to best the Oyo gbonkas. They abandoned the battlefield thereafter, and the Oyo later claimed victory. She was succeeded by Ajiboyede.

He writes picture books, young adult novels and the 4 for 4 middle-grade series. He is best known for his books on basketball, Strong to the Hoop, Around the World, and Hoop Genius as well as Night Driving, Their Great Gift, and his coming-of-age novel, Crackback. He lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota and visits schools around the world. Biography =Early life= Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, John Richard Coy was the oldest of four children. His parents were both educators: Coy's father taught college history and his mother taught high school English. Graduating from Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, he later received his master of arts degree in children and creativity from St. Mary's University in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Coy worked at a variety of jobs‚Äîdishwasher, tour guide, mattress maker‚Äîbefore deciding on a career as a writer. =Career= His first picture book, Night Driving, was inspired by cross-country driving trips on which his father took his family of six when the author was young. John, the oldest, usually sat in front with his father, talking during the wee hours of the night, learning more about his dad than he did when the family was at home. John's book Strong to the Hoop involved him in the National Basketball Association's Read to Achieve program. Strong to the Hoop was translated into Spanish as Directo al Aro four years later. The publisher asked that John write a book about basketball as it is played in countries all over the world. That book became Around the World. Working with boys during school visits, talking to them, hearing the reasons they do and do not read, John has written books he would have liked reading as a teen. Crackback is set within the realities of high school football and Box Out perceptively follows a sophomore as he is called up to play varsity basketball. His third young adult novel Gap Life is about Cray Franklin, a boy whose parents will pay for college, but only if he studies what they want, which is not what he wants. John's popular 4 for 4 series offers readers four novels about four friends engaged in sports, making the transition from elementary school to middle school. Middle grade readers will enjoy: Top of the Order, which is all about baseball; Eyes on the Goal, which tells an exciting soccer story; Love of the Game,', in which the four friends hope to make the football team; Take Your Best Shot, a hoops story that concludes the series. Strong to the Hoop, Night Driving, and Vroomaloom Zoom have been produced as children's theater throughout the United States. John has worked as a librettist with the Minnesota Orchestra, an editor for the Youth Computer Center at the Science Museum of Minnesota, and a tour guide for the Minnesota Historical Society. He has also worked extensively with developmentally disabled adults and children.

It was established in 1854, as one of the earliest French-speaking settlements in southern Ontario. Pain Court was founded when English and French-speaking squatters from the Detroit, Michigan, area began to settle the indigenous lands along the lower Thames River in the region in the 1780s. It derived its name from the small loaves of bread which the impoverished parishioners offered to Roman Catholic missionaries.Ontario Heritage Trust Pain Court By the 1820s in the nearby \\"Pain Court Block\\", one of the earliest French- speaking (franco-ontarian) communities in southern Ontario had developed. Named Pain Court (literally meaning \\"short bread\\") by Catholic missionaries in reference to the small loaves of bread which was all the impoverished parishioners could offer, the settlement was surveyed in 1829. In 1852 a chapel was built and two years later construction of a church commenced. It quickly became the cultural and educational centre of French-speaking Catholics in the area.

The ship spent a brief time in reserve before she was assigned to the Channel Squadron for two years in 1890. In 1893 Aurora became a coast guard ship in Ireland for two years before she was placed in reserve again. The ship recommissioned in 1899 for service on the China Station and some of her crew participated in the Battle of Tientsin in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. Aurora returned home two years later and was again reduced to reserve. She was taken out of service in 1905 and sold for scrap on 2 October 1907. Design and description The Orlando-class cruisers were enlarged versions of the with more armour and a more powerful armament. Like their predecessors, they were intended to protect British shipping.Gardiner, p. 109 Aurora had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of . Designed to displace , all of the Orlando-class ships proved to be overweight and displaced approximately . The ships were powered by a pair of three- cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by four boilers with forced draught. The ship carried a maximum of of coal which was designed to give her a range of at a speed of . The ship's complement was 484 officers and enlisted men.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 65 Auroras main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) Mk V guns, one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on pivot mounts. Her secondary armament was ten BL guns, five on each broadside. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six quick- firing (QF) 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and ten QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, most of which were mounted on the main deck in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457 mm) torpedo tubes: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water. The ship was protected by a waterline compound armour belt thick. It covered the middle of the ship and was high. Because the ship was overweight, the top of the armour belt was below the waterline when she was fully loaded.Friedman, p. 146 The ends of the armour belt were closed off by transverse bulkheads . The lower deck was thick over the full length of the hull. The conning tower was protected by of armour.

She was transferred to Bantry, Ireland, in 1893 to serve as the local coastguard ship until 1895. That year the ship was reassigned to the Devonport Reserve and remained there until 1899. Aurora participated in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet review on 26 June 1897 at Spithead. Aurora was recommissioned for service in the Far East in 1899 under the command of Captain Edward Bayly and some of her crew, including Bayly, took part in the Battle of Tientsin in July 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion.Perry, pp. 45‚Äì47 In early February 1902 she was ordered to leave, homebound, arriving at Aden on 3 March, at Malta 17 March, and at Plymouth on 26 March.

County jailers and public security officers are also regulated by TCOLE. With the passage of Senate Bill 686 in the 83rd Legislative Session, the commission's name was changed from \\"Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Education\\" to \\"Texas Commission on Law Enforcement\\" on January 1, 2014. Overview TCOLE operates under the authority granted by the Texas Legislature in Chapter 1701 of the Texas Occupations Code. Among its duties, TCOLE grants peace officer, county jailer, and public security officer licenses after minimum standards are met or suspends or revokes licenses for noncompliance, verifies that continuing education requirements are fulfilled, promulgates requirements for obtaining proficiency certificates, and regulates police academies. TCOLE also employs investigators that are designated as peace officers to assist in the enforcement of Chapter 1701. Structure The TCOLE Board of Commissioners formulates agency policies and makes recommendations to the Governor of Texas and the Legislature regarding related matters. Its nine members are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Texas Senate, to serve without pay for staggered, six-year terms. Three members must be sheriffs, constables, or chiefs of police. Three other members must be TCOLE licensees for at least five years (two of which must hold non- supervisory, peace officer positions). The last three members are chosen from the general population. The Board employs an Executive Director to lead the day-to-day operations of the agency. TCOLE is divided into the following divisions: *Credentialing Division *Enforcement Division *Special Services Division * Field Services Division * Legal Division * Finance Division History The impetus for the creation of TCLEOSE in 1965 was to improve law enforcement proficiency. By 1969, mandatory standards were promulgated for the employment of peace officers appointed after September 1, 1970. The first iteration of the standards for the Basic Peace Officer Course (BPOC) was issued in 1970, which called for a 140-hour minimum curriculum. In 1971, the appointment of trained reserve officers was authorized. Medical and psychological examinations were added for licensure in 1976. Continuing education was not required until 1983. The Texas Peace Officers' Memorial project was started in 1989 and the memorial was dedicated in 1999. In 2004, the current BPOC standards were implemented, which call for a minimum of 618 hours of instruction for new peace officer licenses. The Texas Sunset Commission is charged with recommending if a public need exists for the continuation of each state agency or its advisory committees or for the performance of their functions.

The Habsburgs and the Ottomans engaged in a series of military campaigns against one another in Hungary between 1526 and 1568. While overall the Ottomans had the upper hand, the war failed to produce any decisive result. The Ottoman army remained very powerful in the open field but it often lost a significant amount of time besieging the many fortresses of the Hungarian frontier and its communication lines were now dangerously overstretched. At the end of the conflict, Hungary had been split into several different zones of control, between the Ottomans, Habsburgs, and Transylvania, an Ottoman vassal state. 1530s Following Suleiman's unsuccessful Siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand I launched a counter-attack in 1530 to regain the initiative and avenge the destruction brought by Suleiman's 120,000 strong army. Suleiman's response came in 1532 when he led a massive army of over 120,000 troops to besiege Vienna again. Ferdinand withdrew his army, leaving only 700 men with no cannons and a few guns to defend G√ºns (K≈ëszeg).Turnbull, Stephen. The Ottoman Empire 1326‚Äì1699. New York: Osprey, 2003. pg 51 In the Siege of G√ºns, the Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, Ibrahim Pasha, did not realize how poorly defended Koszeg was; in fact Constantinople in 1453 stood a better chance. Nonetheless, under the leadership of Croatian Captain Nikola Juri≈°iƒá, the city fought off every assault. The exact outcome of the battle is unknown, since it has two versions which differ depending on the source. In the first version Nikola Juri≈°iƒá rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and in the second version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. In any case, the Ottomans withdrew at the arrival of the August rains. During their retreat, they suffered a defeat at the Battle of Leobersdorf against an imperial army led by Frederick II, Elector Palatine. The Treaty of Constantinople (1533) was signed between Ferdinand and Suleiman. John Szapolyai was recognized as King of Hungary as an Ottoman vassal. However, the Ottomans recognized the land under Habsburg rule in Hungary.Turnbull, Stephen. The Ottoman Empire 1326‚Äì1699. New York: Osprey, 2003. pg 52 This treaty did not satisfy John Szapolyai or Ferdinand whose armies began to skirmish along the borders. Ferdinand decided to strike a decisive blow in 1537 at John by sending his ablest generals to take Osijek, thereby violating the treaty. The siege failed and led to the Battle of Gorjani, which was a disaster of similar magnitude to that of Moh√°cs with an Ottoman relief army smashing the Austrians. However, rather than attack Vienna again, Suleiman sent an army of 8,000 light cavalry to attack Otranto in southern Italy the same year. The troops were withdrawn from Italy after an expected French invasion designed to coordinate with Ottoman efforts failed to materialize. Nonetheless, an Ottoman victory at the naval Battle of Preveza in 1538 gave the Habsburg-led coalition another defeat. 1540s In 1541, the Ottomans failed to take the fortress of Szigetv√°r. However a humiliating defeat was inflicted on the Habsburgs in the Siege of Buda (1541). John Szapolyai had died in 1540 and his son was only a few weeks old. An Austrian attack on Buda followed the news of the death of John, but the appeals of John's widow to Suleiman were not unanswered and in 1541 the elderly General Rogendorf was defeated outside of Buda, before he could even cross the Danube to take it. The next year Ferdinand besieged Pest but was repulsed. Siege of Esztergom, 1543 (detail). In April 1543 Suleiman launched another campaign in Hungary, bringing back Bran and other forts so that much of Hungary was under Ottoman control. As part of a Franco-Ottoman alliance (see also: Franco-Hungarian alliance and Petar Kegleviƒá), French troops were supplied to the Ottomans in Hungary: a French artillery unit was dispatched in 1543‚Äì1544 and attached to the Ottoman Army.The Ottoman Empire and early modern Europe by Daniel Goffman, p.111 Firearms of the Islamic world, p.38The Cambridge History of Islam, p.328 In August 1543, the Ottoman succeeded in the Siege of EsztergomGround warfare: an international encyclopedia by Stanley Sandler p.387 The siege would be followed by the capture of the Hungarian coronation city of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in September 1543.Slovak history: chronology & lexicon J√∫lius Bartl p.59 Other cities that were captured during this campaign are Sikl√≥s and Szeged in order to better protect Buda. However, continuous delay of the push toward the west, because of the siege of these fortresses, meant that the Ottomans could not launch any new offensive against Austria. From 1548 to the end of the war, a Habsburg Spanish infantry tercio which had fought in the Schmalkaldic War, led by Maestre de campo Bernardo de Aldana, was detached in Hungary to fight against John Z√°polya's supporters on behalf of Ferdinand.Korp√°s, Zolt√°n: La correspondencia de un soldado espa√±ol de las guerras de Hungr√≠a a mediados del siglo XVI.

Scott; Fuchs, Martina: The histories of Emperor Charles V: nationale Perspektiven von Pers√∂nlichkeit und Herrschaft. M√ºnster: Aschendorff, 2005. , p. 235 Aftermath Peace was finally concluded in Edirne in 1568, and renewed in 1576, 1584, and 1591. War would not again break out between the Habsburgs and Ottomans until 1593, in the Long Turkish War. However, throughout this period of peace small-scale warfare continued, a conflict known as the \\"Little War\\" (). No large armies or sustained campaigns were launched, but authorities on both sides continually struggled with hostile raiders and forays across the poorly-demarcated border. Both sides, however, desired that peace continue.

The route runs from the Maryland border in the Lewisville section of Elk Township, where it continues as Maryland Route 213 (MD 213), north to PA 82 in the Doe Run section of West Marlborough Township. The route heads through rural areas of southwestern Chester County on a two-lane undivided road. PA 841 passes through West Grove, where it has an interchange with U.S. Route 1 (US 1). PA 841 was first assigned to an unpaved road running from Springdell to PA 82 in 1928. The route was extended south to its current terminus in 1937 and was completely paved by 1940. Route description PA 841 northbound at PA 472 in Lewisville PA 841 begins at the Maryland border in the community of Lewisville in Elk Township, Chester County, where the road continues south into that state as MD 213. From the state line, the route heads north on two-lane undivided Chesterville Road, intersecting the southern terminus of PA 472 a short distance past the state line. The road continues north through a mix of farms and woods with some homes, crossing the Big Elk Creek into New London Township. The route turns to the east and enters Franklin Township, where it curves to the northeast. PA 841 comes to an intersection with PA 896 and continues through rural areas with some residences. In the community of Chesterville, the route turns northwest onto Wickerton Road. PA 841 curves to the north and heads into London Grove Township as it continues through rural land with increasing residential subdivisions. The road enters the borough of West Grove and becomes Prospect Avenue, where it is lined with homes. In the center of town, the route passes a few businesses and crosses an East Penn Railroad line at-grade. PA 841 turns east onto Evergreen Street and curves northeast past residences and commercial establishments. The route splits from Evergreen Street by heading north onto Chatham Road. PA 841 leaves West Grove for London Grove Township again and comes to an interchange with the US 1 freeway. The road continues into a mix of farmland and woodland with occasional homes, crossing a stream on a one- lane bridge. In the community of Chatham, the route turns east onto London Grove Road and comes to a junction with PA 41. Past PA 41, PA 841 turns north onto Coatesville Road and continues north through agricultural areas with a few homes, reaching an intersection with PA 926. Upon crossing PA 926, the road heads into West Marlborough Township on North Chatham Road and makes a turn to the northwest through farmland and woods. The route intersects the western terminus of PA 842 and makes a curve to the north before bending to the northeast. PA 841 continues north to the community of Springdell, where it makes a sharp turn to the east. The route curves northeast through farmland and continues to its northern terminus at PA 82 in the community of Doe Run. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, present-day PA 841 was not given a route number. In 1928, PA 841 was designated onto an unpaved road running from Springdell northeast to PA 82. In 1937, PA 841 was extended south from Springdell to its current southern terminus at the Maryland border, following its current alignment. By 1940, the entire length of the route was paved. PA 841 has remained along the same alignment since.

He succeeded Orompoto. Events of reign According to Oyo tales, the empire was attacked by the King of Nupe, Lajomo, during Ajiboyede's time in office. Originally, the battle was going in favor of the invaders until a bit of trickery and heroism by Ajanlapa, the Osi-wefa, changed the course and gave favor to the Oyos. To commemorate Ajanlapa's valor in war, the King created a special honor in the palace for Ajanlapa's son. The son was given a full-time and rare permission to be a guest in the palace of the Alaafin and to take the stead in place of the king at some occasions. Unfortunately, this honor required that he had to become a eunuch, as this was the tradition for high court offices. Ajiboyede thought it would be ungrateful to have Ajanlapa's son castrated, but his advisers strongly recommended the procedure. The King agreed and the boy was castrated. Ajiboyede is credited with starting the three-year festival known as Bebe, to celebrate peace after the victory over the Nupes and to celebrate Ajiboyede's long reign. During the peaceful period, commerce and agriculture thrived, and the new capital of Igboho began to grow as a result of a favorable geographical location and population concentration. In the process, two major markets were established during his reign, and the city became a major trade route for acquiring horses from Hausaland. Shortly after the Bebe festival began, Ajiboyede's firstborn son, the Arema Osemolu, died. Whilst Ajiboyede was mourning and fasting he reportedly had some chiefs visiting him executed for supposedly having eaten food, which nearly caused a rebellion. Ajiboyede was succeeded by Abipa.

Its creation is the sole instance in the law of the Kingdom of Ireland recognising a peerage by writ. Origin of the title James Power, 3rd Earl of Tyrone, who was also the 8th Baron Power, held both his titles by letters patent (dated 1535 and 1637 respectively), which specified that the titles would be inherited by heirs male of the grantee. When he died in 1704 however, his only child was a daughter, Lady Catharine Power. The Earldom became extinct, and in an ordinary course of events, the Barony of Power would have been inherited by his distant cousin, Colonel John Power (or Poore) of the French R√©giment de Dublin. The colonel was however a Jacobite and therefore outlawed and attainted in 1688. Although inheriting none of the titles, Lady Catharine therefore inherited the land. Lady Catharine grew up and married in 1717 an Irish freemason and politician, Sir Marcus Beresford, 4th Baronet. After a lawsuit with John Power, Sir Marcus and Lady Catharine retained the Power property, and Sir Marcus was raised into the Peerage of Ireland by creating him Viscount Tyrone in 1720. After the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, he was further elevated in 1746 as Earl of Tyrone (the same name of title as that of his father-in-law, but a new creation). After he died in 1763, Lady Catharine, now the Dowager Countess of Tyrone, had petitioned the Irish House of Lords to restore to her the \\"Barony de la Poer\\", which she asserted was created by writ for her grandfather Richard Power. He was summoned to the Parliament of Ireland somewhere in the 1650s, but was not yet a peer. He became the 6th Baron Power in 1661, and was created the 1st Earl of Tyrone and 1st Viscount Decies in 1673. =Petition= The petition was based on another writ received by Nicholas (fitz John) le Poer, of Kilmeadan, who was summoned to the Parliament of Ireland on 23 November 1375, 22 January 1378, and 11 September 1380. The Dowager Countess of Tyrone was a descendant of Nicholas's daughter Ellen, who married David Poer or Power, known as \\"Davey Rothe\\", of Conoughmore, ancestor of the Barons Power. Since Nicholas le Poer also had sons who left children, the Countess was not heiress of Nicholas. Nevertheless, on 9 November 1767 the Irish House of Lords resolved that she had proved her case; the Crown confirmed this on 19 December 1767 and allowed her \\"all the rights and privileges belonging to the said Barony\\", as they had been held by \\"her grandfather Richard, who sat and voted as Baron La Poer\\". As Complete Peerage remarks, the effect of a resolution that \\"a lady was entitled to a barony that never existed\\" (and to which she would not be heiress if it had) is open to question; so is the confirmation in all the rights of a man who never held the barony. =Successors= When the Dowager Countess died, 27 July 1769, any title she may have held passed to her son George, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, who was promoted to Marquess of Waterford in 1789, as part of the British government's effort to manage Grattan's Parliament; all his titles are held today by Henry Beresford, 9th Marquess of Waterford. \\"Barony by writ\\" vs. \\"barony by patent\\" Instead of a barony by patent, a \\"barony by writ\\" is a hereditary title created by a writ of summons, but without issuing a letters patent. Other differences are that a barony by writ is inherited in strict order of succession by the heirs general of the recipient of the writ: daughters of barons, if they are only children (like Countess Catharine), do therefore inherit such baronies. A barony by writ is a typical creation of English common law, but aside from this case, they are now almost non-existent in the Peerage of Ireland. Spelling Both titles and the surnames le Poer, Power, Poore are all forms of the same name, originally Anglo-Norman le pover, \\"the Poor\\". It was quite common in medieval England and Ireland; the spellings de la Poer and La Poer, in the feminine, originate from the Countess's petition, although it is ungrammatical, and J. H. Round called it \\"idiotic\\"; the feminine article may be the result of applying it to a peeress. Her spelling has been widely used as a middle name by her Beresford descendants; some of the Powers also adopted this fashionable spelling. Some romantics also claimed a connection with Poher in Brittany. One of these changes of name was made by Frances Power, daughter of Sir John Power, Baronet of Kilfane, who happened to marry another John Power (of Castle Gurteen de la Poer), the lineal heir of Colonel John Power above-mentioned; as a widow she changed her name legally to Frances de la Poer, in commemoration of a companion of Strongbow; her son styled himself Edmond James de Poher de la Poer; his son, John William Rivallon de la Poer, petitioned the Crown in 1920 to recognize him as Baron Power; the Committee of Privileges of the British House of Lords decided that he would be Baron le Power and Conoughmore, if it were not for his ancestor's outlawry, but they did not reverse it.

Biography  Yoshimi Takeuchi was a Sinologist, a cultural critic and translator. He studied Chinese author Lu Xun and translated Lu‚Äôs works into Japanese. His book-length study, Lu Xun (1944) ignited a significant reaction in the world of Japanese thought during and after the Pacific War. Takeuchi formed a highly successful Chinese literature study group with Taijun Takeda in 1934 and this is regarded as the beginning of modern Sinology in Japan. He was a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University from 1953 to 1960 when he resigned in protest. He was known as a distinguished critic of Sino-Japanese issues and his complete works (vols. 17) were published by Chikuma Shobo during 1980-82. In 1931, Takeuchi graduated from high school and entered the faculty of letters at Tokyo Imperial University, where he met his lifelong friend, Taijun Takeda. Together they formed the Chinese Literature Research Society (Chugoku Bungaku Kenkyukai) and in 1935, they published an official organ for the group, Chugoku Bungaku Geppo in order to open up the study of contemporary Chinese literature as opposed to the \\"old-style\\" Japanese Sinology. During 1937 to 1939 he studied abroad in Beijing where he became depressed due to the geo-political situation and drank a lot (cf. Second Sino-Japanese War). In 1940, he changed the title of the official organ from Chugoku Bungaku Geppo to Chugoku Bungaku in which he published a controversial article, \\"The Greater East Asia War and our resolve\\" in January 1942. In January 1943, he broke up the Chinese Literature Research Society and decided to discontinue the publication of Chugoku Bungaku despite the group becoming quite successful. In December, he was called up for the Chinese front and stayed there until 1946. This encounter what he saw as the real living China and Chinese people, as opposed to the abstract China of his studies, made a deep impression on him. He threw himself into a study of the modern colloquial languageDuus (1988: 770-2) and during this time, his maiden work was published, the book-length study Lu Xun (1944). After repatriation, his essays On leader consciousness and What is modernity? became the focus of public attention in 1948 during the Japanese occupation. It is from such essays that his status as an important postwar critic was gradually acknowledged. After 1949, he was greatly moved by the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and he continued to refer to the PRC in his articles and books. In 1953, he became a full professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University, a post he eventually resigned from in protest at the abuses of parliamentary voting procedures during the period of civil unrest and protest that arose while the ratification of the revised Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan took place in May 1960. During the struggle, he led the movement as one of the foremost thinkers in post-war Japan under the slogan \\"democracy or dictatorship\\". From 1963, he argued in favor of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Cultural Revolution in his magazine Chugoku published by Chugoku no Kai until the diplomatic normalization between Japan and the PRC (1972). He was particularly interested in Mao's \\"Philosophy of base/ground\\" (konkyochi tetsugaku) which involves the principle of making one's enemy one's own. For Takeuchi, this was similar to Lu Xun's notion of cheng-cha, or endurance/resistance. In his later years, Takeuchi devoted himself to doing a new translation of Lu Xun's works. Yu Dafu In his graduation thesis, Takeuchi discussed Yu Dafu. He concluded: > Yu Dafu‚Äîhe was an agonal poet. He pursued self-agony with a sincere manner > and brought abnormal influence in the Chinese literary world by coming to > light in bold expression. Because his agony sums up his young > contemporaries' agony.Takeuchi Yoshimi zenshu (vol.17, p.160) \\"Not (accommodating oneself to external authority) but (digging down self- agony). Yu Dafu did not reign over the people but was connected with others' agony. Takeuchi described his style as 'art of the strength that devoting oneself solely to weakness'.\\" Oguma (2002: 398-9), Takeuchi Yoshimi zenshu (vol.14, p. 62) Japan as a humiliation =Shina and Chugoku= Takeuchi felt guilty about the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. At that time, Tokyo called China as not \\"Shina\\" but \\"Chugoku\\" for directing friendship between Japan and the Wang Jingwei regime. In Japanese, \\"Shina\\" is a discriminatory word for China. Takeuchi attempted to culturally resist such a manner in a period of a total war. However, as he knew the Greater East Asia War was also to some extent intended and characterized as a war to liberate East and Southeast Asian nations, Takeuchi pathetically declared his resolve (1942) for what he saw as a war of justice, which is generally interpreted as his cooperation with the war effort. After defeat in 1945, however, he knew that the declared aims of the war were deceptive and he tried to explain its aporias of both the liberation of colonies and anti-imperialism. =Overcoming modernity= > \\"Overcoming modernity\\" was one of the catchwords that took hold of Japanese > intellectuals during the war.

In other words, it would be impossible > to form tradition.Calichman (2005: 110) After the defeat of 1945, Japanese journalism was full of discussion surrounding the issue of war responsibility, particularly that intellectuals and a famous wartime symposium entitled \\"Overcoming Modernity\\" which involved literary critic, Kobayashi Hideo and Kyoto-school philosopher, Nishida Kitaro. Wartime intellectuals were classified into three groups: Literary World, the \\"Japanese Romantics\\" (such as Yasuda Yojiro) and the Kyoto School. The \\"Overcoming Modernity\\" symposium was held in wartime Japan in (1942) and sought to interpret Japanese imperialism‚Äôs Asian mission in a positive historical light, as not any kind of simple fawning on Fascism, but rather ultimately, a step in the proper direction of Japan's destiny as an integral part of Asia. This was only a step, however, as, according to Takeuchi, while highlighting the aporias of modernity, the \\"Overcoming Modernity\\" debates failed to make those aporias themselves the subject of thought. Critic Odagiri Hideo criticized the symposium as an \\"ideological campaign consisting in the defense and theorization of the militaristic tenn≈ç state and the submission to its war system\\". His view was accepted widely in post-war Japan. However, Takeuchi strongly opposed this easy pseudo-leftist formula. > The Pacific War's dual aspects of colonial invasion and anti-imperialism > were united, and it was by this time impossible to separate these > aspects.Calichman (2005: 125) For the Kyoto School, it was dogma that was > important; they were indifferent to reality.

The > intellectual role played by Yasuda was that of eradicating thought through > the destruction of all categories. ...

And the role that everyone had \\"eagerly > anticipated\\" was that of the medium itself, who appears at the end as the > \\"lead actor in a great farce.\\" Yasuda played this role brilliantly. By > destroying all values and categories of thought, he relieved the thinking > subject of all responsibility.Calichman (2005: 143‚Äì144) Kobayashi Hideo was > able to divest all meaning from facts, but he could not go beyond this. > Literary World could only wait for the \\"medium\\" that was Yasuda to come and > announce the disarmament of ideas.Calichman (2005: 144) In sum, the > \\"Overcoming Modernity\\" symposium marked the final attempt at forming > thought, an attempt that, however, failed. Such formation of thought would > at least take as its point of departure the aim of transforming the logic of > total war. It failed in that it ended in the destruction of > thought.Calichman (2005: 145) In wartime 1942, Takeuchi declared a resolve on the war without fanatical chauvinism. In the postwar, Takeuchi's discussion was centred on the dual aspects of the Greater East Asia War. He attempted to resist war characteristics by using his own logic. However, for him, the wartime symposiums failed in the end. \\"Overcoming Modernity\\" resulted in scholastic chaos. Kobayashi Hideo of Literary World, who beat \\"World-Historical Standpoint\\" of the Kyoto School, was unworthy at this time. On behalf of such Kobayashi, Yasuda Yojuro of the Japanese Romantics showed only contempt. =National literature criticism= During 1951 to 1953, Takeuchi argued with literary critic, Sei It≈ç over the nature of a national literature (cf. Treaty of San Francisco). In 1954, Takeuchi published Kokumin Bungaku-ron [Theory of a national literature]. He criticized Japanese modernism for avoiding the problem of the \\"nation\\". Takeuchi envisaged national literature as needing to address the aporia of the nation as a cultural practice. =Foresight and mistakes= In 1960, the Japanese government rammed a revised version of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security through the House of Representatives. Takeuchi saw it undemocratic and he decided to resign as professor of Tokyo Metropolitan University. Takeuchi attempted to generalize war experiences of the Japanese people to establish Japanese democratic subjectivity. As a result, he failed to accomplish his goal. Takeuchi said, \\"Now, I think the Japanese nation will die out. Maybe, there is a possibility to be restored to life in the future. However, Japan is stateless in the present.\\" \\"Asia as method\\"  = Lu Xun= \\"According to Takeuchi, the core part of Lu Xun 'is awareness of the literature which was acquired through a confrontation with politics'. Literature in itself is directly powerless. However, as a result, literature could be involved in politics by devoting literature to literature. A writer could be powerful if he would dig down mental \\"darkness\\" and realize self-denial and self-innovation without dependence. Lu Xun was aware of this, so Takeuchi calls it \\"reform\\" ('eshin').Oguma (2002: 414), Takeuchi Yoshimi zenshu (vol.1, pp.55) =Chinese modernity and Japanese modernity= For Takeuchi, Japanese society was authoritative and discriminatory. Takeuchi criticized Japanese modernists and modernization theorists who adopted a stopgap measure and recognized Japan as superior to Asia aiming at though revolutions. Takeuchi argued that Chinese modernity qualitatively surpassed Japanese one. However, those modernists looked down on Asia and concluded Japan was not Asian. Generally speaking, the Japanese have a tendency to interpret Asia as backward. For Takeuchi, Japan and his greatest \\"darkness\\" were nothing but the issue of war responsibility. In What is modernity? (1948), Takeuchi stated: > \\"Ultranationalism and Japanism were once fashionable. These were to have > banished Europe; they were not to have banished the slave structure that > accommodates Europe. Now modernism is fashionable as a reaction against > these ideologies, but the structure that accommodates modernity is still not > problematized. Japan, in other words, attempts to replace the master; it > does not seek independence. This is equivalent to treating Tojo Hideki as a > backward student, so that other honor students remain in power in order to > preserve the honor student culture itself. It is impossible to negate Tojo > by opposing him: one must go beyond him. To accomplish this, however, one > must even utilize him.\\"Calichman (2005:79-80) \\"<Class-A war criminals> and <Non-class-A war criminals> are supplement relations.See International Military Tribunal for the Far East and war crime. It is meaningless to declare 'Japanism' to oppose with the West. Likewise, it is meaningless to declare Western modernism to oppose with 'Japanism'. In order to deny <Tojo>, you must not oppose with <Tojo> and must surpass <Tojo> by facing up to your image of <Tojo>. And it was equal to war-time Takeuchi himself who adopted <December 8> and criticized the Greater East Asia Writers' Congress.\\"In autumn of 1942, Nihon Bungaku Hokokukai requested Takeuchi (the Chinese Literature Research Society) for a cooperation to their meeting. However, Takeuchi refused it from the front. Takeuchi stated that he did not consent this meeting from the aspect of the choice of the personnel because it did not represent both Japanese and Chinese literature circles for honour of the both sides. He also stated that the reason \\"was because I was sure to be able to realize December 8 in the literature\\". For Takeuchi, he was going to do seriously <resistance> in aggressive reality by advocating <true liberation of East Asia>.\\" (Oguma, 2002:408))Oguma (2002: 429-30) =Japanese Asianism= Takeuchi admitted modern Japanese Asianism ended with an empty official slogan \\"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\\" and Japanese defeat of 1945 after all. In post-war Japan, the Greater East Asia War thoroughly denied at all. Takeuchi questioned Japanese pacifism which led to lose the attitudes and responsibilities towards Asia as an Asian nation. Takeuchi depressed such a situation. He set to reviewing Japanese modern history through Asianism. Takeuchi edited an anthology of Asianism in which he commented that Asianism is not an ideology but a trend and that it is impossible to distinguish between \\"invasion\\" and \\"solidarity\\" in Japanese Asianism. He explained that \\"Asianism\\" originated from Tokichi Tarui and Yukichi Fukuzawa in the 1880s. The former Tarui argued for unionizing Japan and Korea equally to strengthen Greater East Asian security. Takeuchi appreciated Tarui's work as an unprecedented masterpiece. The latter Fukuzawa argued for Japan casting off Asia who was barbarian and vulgar company.Fukuzawa was not a non-Pan-Asianist at all. His thesis just relied on a realist view. Takeuchi appreciated Fukuzawa's article as a stronger appeal to the public than Tarui's. The victories of the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War made Japanese solidarity with Asia further and further. After the victories of the above wars, Japan inclined to build a \\"new order\\" in East Asia. Japan could not be a hope of Asia. Takeuchi indicated Japanese structural defect derived from wrong honours. He interpreted Japanese Asianism as Ko-A (raising Asia) taken over Datsu-A (casting off Asia). For Takeuchi, Asia is not a geographical concept but a concept against \\"modern Europe\\", and so, Japan is non-Asian. When the Japanese accomplish to overcome modernity, they can be Asian. By \\"modern Europe\\", it is feudal class society full of discrimination and authoritarianism. \\"Asia\\" could be liberation from imperialism, which cut off a relationship between dominant and subject. Perhaps, his views were non- realist and progressive in a sense. Takeuchi wished Japan to be Asianized. The concept of Asia is nothing but an ideal for him. He said: \\"In a political dimension, post-war Bandung conference made an idea of Asianness in history\\". Referring to Rabindranath Tagore and Lu Xun, Takeuchi addressed: > Rather the Orient must re-embrace the West, it must change the West itself > in order to realize the latter's outstanding cultural values on a greater > scale. Such a rollback of culture or values would create universality. The > Orient must change the West in order to further elevate those universal > values that the West itself produced. This is the main problem facing East- > West relations today, and it is at once a political and cultural > issue.Calichman (2005: 165) =The origin of peace= After 1945, Takeuchi has called upon the normalization between China and Japan. In 1972, the Joint Communiqu√© of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China was concluded. Takeuchi criticized the Japanese attitudes towards the past. The issues of history have been a big concern in the Sino-Japanese relations.

Headly. His father was a captain in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. He was raised on a farm near Providence, Kentucky and came to Louisville at age 21 to take a job in a tobacco warehouse. He worked his way up through the tobacco industry for the rest of his professional career. In 1894 he was elected to the Kentucky General Assembly as a Democrat. With the support of the John Henry Whallen's Democratic machine, he defeated James F. Grinstead to be elected mayor of Louisville in 1909. Local newspapers ran stories intended to scare white voters into voting for Head, exploiting fears of the growing black community in Louisville. Head oversaw efforts to reform the city's tenement housing, adding code to the city's charter forbidding various unacceptable practices by landlords. The city also began appropriating funding for the University of Louisville during his administration. After his term as mayor, he served as a delegate to the Democratic National Committee and as president of the Louisville Water Company. Death He died on April 19, 1931 in Clearwater, Florida and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery.

Mission  The mission of the formerly known European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) was to provide scientific and technical support for the conception, development, implementation and monitoring of EU policies on chemicals and consumer products. It co-ordinated the EU risk assessment programmes that covered the risks posed by existing substances and new substances to workers, consumers and the environment. It also developed guidance documents and tools in support of the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) Regulation, the Testing Methods Regulation, the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), the notification of new substances, the information exchange on import and export of dangerous substances, the development and harmonisation of testing methods and the authorisation of biocides.  Biocides  The Biocides Work Area provided scientific and technical support for the approval of active substances in biocidal products as laid down in Directive 98/8/EC (Biocidal Products Directive, BPD) concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market. Currently, these tasks are dealt with by the biocides group within the IHCP.

However, the twelfth Imam disappeared into what Shia believe is \\"occultation\\" (ghaybat) in 939 AD and so has not been present to rule over the Muslim community for over a thousand years. In the absence of the Imam, Shia scholars/religious leaders accepted the idea of non-religious leaders (typically a sultan, king, or shah) managing political affairs, defending Shia Muslims and their territory, but no consensus emerged among the scholars as to how Muslims should relate to those leaders. Shia jurists have tended to stick to one of three approaches to the state: cooperating with it, becoming active in politics to influence its policies, or most commonly, remaining aloof from it.Moojan Momen, An Introduction to Shi'i Islam (1985), p. 193. For some years, Khomeini opted for the second of these three, believing Islam should encompass all aspects of life, especially the state, and disapproving of Iran's weak Qajar dynasty, the western concepts and language borrowed in the 1906 constitution, and especially the authoritarian secularism and modernization of the Pahlavi Shahs. Precedents for this approach included the theory of \\"co-working with the just sultan\\" put forward by Sayyed Murtaza during the Buyid era in his work \\"Al-Resala Al-Amal Ma'a Sultan\\" about 1000 years ago, and his idea was developed further by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. Clerical political influence was institutionalized during the Safavid Empire about 500 years ago. In modern times the Grand Ayatollah Mirza Shirazi intervened against Nasir al-Din Shah when that Qajar Shah gave a 50-year monopoly over the distribution and exportation of tobacco to a foreign non-Muslim. Shirazi issued the famous fatwa against the usage of tobacco as part of the Tobacco Protest. In 1970 Khomeini broke from this tradition developing a fourth approach to the state, a revolutionary change in Shia Islam proclaiming that monarchy was inherently unjust, and religious legal scholars should not just become involved in politics but rule. (see below) Legacy At least one scholar has argued that Khomeini's \\"decrees, sermons, interviews, and political pronouncements\\" have outlasted his theological works because it is the former and not the latter that the Islamic Republic of Iran \\"constantly reprints.\\" Without the decrees, sermons, interviews, and political pronouncements \\"there would have been no Khomeinism [ideology]. Without Khomeinism there would have been no revolution. And without the Islamic Revolution, Khomeini would have been no more than a footnote to Iranian history.\\" =Improvisational ability= Outside of his doctrinal beliefs, Khomeini has also been noted for being a \\"brilliant tactician,\\" with a great \\"ability to improvise.\\" > Khomeini once protested the shah's enfranchisement of women, and then > encouraged women to participate in his revolution and vote for his > government when he needed their numbers. He once promised that clerics would > hold only temporary positions in government and then allowed them to hold > the most senior positions. He pledged to continue the war against Iraq until > its defeat and then abruptly made peace. He once said that the fact that \\"I > have said something does not mean that I should be bound by my word.\\" > Indeed, it is that suppleness, that ability to improvise that has outlived > Khomeini and that continues to pervade the Islamic Republic, keeping it > going. At least one scholar has argued that Khomeini's ability to swing from one \\"religiopolitical ... perspective to another\\" has been exploited by followers to advance their various and competing agendas. In particular reformists such as Muhammad Khatami in search of more democracy and less theocracy.Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini (2001) p.ix Another argues that Khomeini's \\"ideological adaptability\\" belie the \\"label of fundamentalist\\" applied to him in both the West and in Iran.Abrahamian, Khomeiniism, p.3, 13‚Äì16 =Governance= Rulers As to how jurists should influence governance, Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership changed direction over time as his views on governance evolved. On who should rule and what should be the ultimate authority in governance: *Khomeini originally accepted traditional Shia political theory, writing in \\"Kashf-e Asrar\\" that, \\"We do not say that government must be in the hands of\\" an Islamic jurist, \\"rather we say that government must be run in accordance with God's law ... \\"1942 book/pamphlet Kashf al-Asrar quoted in Islam and Revolution, p.170 suggesting a parliament of Shi'a jurists could choose a just king. ( ÿßŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿÆŸÖŸäŸÜŸâÿå ŸÉÿ¥ŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ±: €±€∏€∑ ‚Äì ÿµ €±€∏€µ) *Later he told his followers that \\"Islam proclaims monarchy and hereditary succession wrong and invalid.\\" Velayat-e Faqih, Hokumat-e-Eslami or Islamic Government, quoted in Islam and Revolution p.31 Only rule by a leading Islamic jurist (velayat-e faqih 1970 book Velayat-e Faqih, Hokumat-e-Eslami or Islamic Government, quoted in Islam and Revolution) would prevent \\"innovation\\" in Sharia or Islamic law and ensure it was properly followed. The need for this governance of the faqih was \\"necessary and self-evident\\" to good Muslims. *Once in power and recognizing the need for more flexibility, he finally insisted the ruling jurist need not be one of the most learned, that Sharia rule was subordinate to interests of Islam (Maslaha ‚Äì \`expedient interests\` or \`public welfare\`Abrahamian, Ervand, A History of Modern Iran, Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.165), and the \\"divine government\\" as interpreted by the ruling jurists, who could overrule Sharia if necessary to serve those interests. The Islamic \\"government, which is a branch of the absolute governance of the Prophet of God, is among the primary ordinances of Islam, and has precedence over all secondary ordinances such as prayer (salat), fasting (sawm), and pilgrimage (hajj).\\" Machinery of government While Khomeini was keenly focused on the ulama's right to rule and the state's \\"moral and ideological foundation\\", he did not dwell on the state's actually functioning or the \\"particulars\\" of its management. According to some scholars (Gheissari and Nasr) Khomeini never \\"put forward a systematic definition of the Islamic state and Islamic economics; ... never described its machinery of government, instruments of control, social function, economic processes, or guiding values and principles.\\" Gheissari, Ali Democracy in Iran: history and the quest for liberty, Ali Gheissari, Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, Oxford University Press, 2006. p. 86-87 In his plan for Islamic Government by Islamic Jurists he wrote: \\"The entire system of government and administration, together with necessary laws, lies ready for you. If the administration of the country calls for taxes, Islam has made the necessary provision; and if laws are needed, Islam has established them all. ... Everything is ready and waiting. All that remains is to draw up ministerial programs ...\\" Islamic Government Islam and Revolution I, Writings and declarations of Imam Khomeini, p.137-8 Danger of conspiracies Khomeini preached the danger of plots by foreigners and their Iranian agents throughout his political career. His belief, common among all political persuasions in Iran, can be explained by the domination of Iran's politics for the past 200 years until the Islamic revolution, first by Russia and Britain, later the United States. Foreign agents were involved in all of Iran's three military coups: 1908 [Russian], 1921[British] and 1953 [UK and US].Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.116 In his series of speeches in which he argued for rule of the Muslim (and non-Muslim) world by Islamic jurists, Khomeini saw the need for theocratic rule to overcome the conspiracies of colonialists who were responsible for > the decline of Muslim civilization, the conservative \`distortions\` of Islam, > and the divisions between nation-states, between Sunnis and Shiis, and > between oppressors and oppressed. He argued that the colonial powers had for > years sent Orientalists into the East to misinterpret Islam and the Koran > and that the colonial powers had conspired to undermine Islam both with > religious quietism and with secular ideologies, especially socialism, > liberalism, monarchism, and nationalism. He claimed that Britain had instigated the 1905 Constitutional Revolution to subvert Islam: \\"The Iranians who drafted the constitutional laws were receiving instructions directly from their British masters.\`\\" Khomeini also held the West responsible for a host of contemporary problems. He charged that colonial conspiracies kept the country poor and backward, exploited its resources, inflamed class antagonism, divided the clergy and alienated them from the masses, caused mischief among the tribes, infiltrated the universities, cultivated consumer instincts, and encouraged moral corruption, especially gambling, prostitution, drug addiction, and alcohol consumption.Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.122 At least one scholar (Ervand Abrahamian) sees \\"far-reaching consequences\\" in legacy of belief in ever- present conspiracy. If conspiracy dominates political action then > \\"those with view different from one's own were members of this or that > foreign conspiracy. Thus political activists tended to equate competition > with treason, ... One does not compromise and negotiate with spies and > traitors; one locks them up or else shoots them. ... The result was > detrimental for the development of political pluralism in Iran. ... > Differences of opinion within organizations could not be accommodated; it > was all too easy for leaders to expel dissidents as 'foreign agents'. Abrahamian believes that what he calls this \\"paranoid style\\" paved the way for the mass executions of 1981‚Äì82, where \\"never before in Iran had firing squads executed so many in so short a time over so flimsy an accusation.\\" Populism One scholar argues that Khomeini, \\"his ideas, and his movement\\" (an ideology he dubs \\"Khomeinism\\") bears a striking resemblance to populist movements in other countries, particularly those of South America such as Juan Per√≥n and Get√∫lio Vargas. Like them Khomeini led a \\"movement of the propertied middle class\\" that mobilized \\"the lower classes, especially the urban poor\\" Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.17 in a \\"radical but pragmatic\\" protest movement \\"against the established order.\\" It attacked \\"the upper class and foreign powers,\\" but not property rights, preaching \\"a return to \`native roots\` and eradication of \`cosmopolitan ideas.\`Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.38 It claimed \\"a noncapitalist, noncommunist \`third way\` towards development,\\" but was intellectually \\"flexible\\",Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.2 emphasizing \\"cultural, national, and political reconstruction,\\" not economic and social revolution.\\" Like those movements it celebrated the oppressed poor which it designated with a label (mostazafin by Khomeini, descamisados (coatless ones) by Peron, trabalhadores by Vargas), while actual power flowed from its leader who was \\"elevated ... into a demigod towering above the people and embodying their historical roots, future destiny, and revolutionary martyrs.\\" Others would say Islam is distinct from Roman Catholicism and that its Middle Eastern beginnings separate it from Fascism. Democracy Whether Khomeini's ideas are compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be democratic is disputed. Notable Iranians who believe he did not include Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi (a senior cleric and main theorist of Iranian ultraconservatives who opposes democracy), Akbar Ganji (a pro- democracy activist and writer who is against Islamic government) and Abdolkarim Soroush (an Iranian philosopher in exile), according to Reza Parsa writing in the state-run Aftab News.Ganji, Sorush and Mesbah Yazdi (Persian) Other followers of Khomeini who believe he did support democracy and that the Islamic Republic is democratic include Ali Khamenei,The principles of Islamic republic from viewpoint of Imam Khomeini in the speeches of the leader (Persian) Mohammad Khatami and Morteza Motahhari.About Islamic republic(Persian) Khomeini preached for theocratic rule by jurists, but did not completely disavow \\"democracy\\", making statements at different times indicating both support and opposition to it.\\"Democracy? I meant theocracy\\", by Dr. Jalal Matini, Translation & Introduction by Farhad Mafie, August 5, 2003, The Iranian, http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2003/August/Khomeini/ For example, telling a huge crowd of Iranians a month after his return to Iran, \\"Do not use this term, \`democratic.\` That is the Western style,\`\\" 1979 March 1, quoted in Bakhash, Shaul The Reign of the Ayatollahs, p.72, 73) One explanation for this contradiction is what Khomeini meant by \\"democracy.\\" According to scholar Shaul Bakhash, it's highly unlikely Khomeini defined the term to mean \\"a Western parliamentary democracy\\" when he told others he wanted Iran to be democratic.He agreed during his meeting with Karin Samjabi in Paris in November 1978 that the future government of Iran would be \`democratic and Islamic\`. Bakhash, The Reign of the Ayatollahs, (1984), p.73 Khomeini believed that the huge turnout of Iranians in anti-Shah demonstrations during the revolution meant that Iranians had already voted in a \`referendum\` for an Islamic republic,Bakhash, The Reign of the Ayatollahs (1984), p.73 and that in Muslim countries Islam and Islamic law, > truly belong to the people. In contrast, in a republic or a constitutional > monarchy, most of those claiming to be representatives of the majority of > the people will approve anything they wish as law and then impose it on the > entire population.Khomeini, Islam and Revolution, (1982), p.56 In drawing up the constitution of his Islamic Republic, he and his supporters agreed to include Western-democratic elements, such as an elected parliament and president, but some argue he believed Islamic elements, not Western-style elected parliaments and presidents, should prevail in government.source: Yusef Sane'i, Velayat-e Faqih, Tehran, 1364/1986, quoted in Moin, Baqer, Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, Thomas Dunne Books, c2000, p.226 After the ratifying of the Islamic constitution he told an interviewer that the constitution in no way contradicted democracy because the \`people love the clergy, have faith in the clergy, and want to be guided by the clergy\` and that it was right that Supreme Leader oversee the work of the non-clerical officials \`to make sure they don't make mistakes or go against the law and the Quran.' Fallaci, Oriana. \\"Interview with Khomeini\\", New York Times, 7 October 1979. As the revolution was consolidated terms like \\"democracy\\" and \\"liberalism\\" ‚Äì considered praiseworthy in the West ‚Äì became words of criticism, while \\"revolution\\" and \\"revolutionary\\" were terms of praise.Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p.228 Still another scholar, non-Iranian Daniel Brumberg, argues that Khomeini's statements on politics were simply not \\"straightforward, coherent, or consistent,\\" and that in particular he contradicted his writings and statements on the primacy of the rule of the jurist with repeated statements on the importance of the leading role of the parliament, such as \`the Majlis heads all affairs\`,Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini (2001) p.1 and \`the majlis is higher than all the positions which exist in the country.\`Address by Ayatollah Khomeini on the Occasion of the Iranian New Year,\` broadcast 20 March 1979, FBIS-MEA-80-56, 21 March 1980 quoted in Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini (2001) p.113 This, according to Brumberg, has created a legacy where his followers \\"exploited these competing notions of authority\\" to advance \\"various agendas of their own.\\" Reformist seizing on his statements about the importance of majlis, and theocrats on those of rule by the clergy. Over the decades since the revolution, Iran has not evolved towards a more liberal representative democratic system as some reformists and democrats had predicted, nor has theocratic rule of Islamic jurists spread to other countries as its founder had hoped. Human rights Before taking power Khomeini expressed support for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\"We would like to act according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We would like to be free. We would like independence.\\",Sahifeh Nour (Vol.2, Page 242) However once in power Khomeini took a firm line against dissent, warning opponents of theocracy for example: \\"I repeat for the last time: abstain from holding meetings, from blathering, from publishing protests. Otherwise I will break your teeth.\\"in Qom, Iran, October 22, 1979, quoted in, The Shah and the Ayatollah : Iranian Mythology and Islamic Revolution by Fereydoun Hoveyda, Westport, Conn. : Praeger, 2003, p.88 Khomeini believed that since Islamic government was essential for Islam, what threatened the government threatened Islam. > Since God Almighty has commanded us to follow the Messenger and the holders > of authority, our obeying them is actually an expression of obedience to > God.Khomeini, Islam and Revolution, (1981), p.91 Iran adopted an alternative human rights declaration, the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, in 1990 (one year after Khomeini's death), which differs from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, requiring law to be in accordance with Sharia,Mathewson Denny, Frederick. \\"Muslim Ethical Trajectories in the Contemporary World\\" in Religious Ethics, William Schweiker, ed. Blackwell Publishers, 2004. , p.272 denying complete equality with men for women, and forbidding speech that violates the \\"dignity of Prophets\\", or \\"undermines moral and ethical values.\\" One observer, Iranian political historian Ervand Abrahamian, believes that some of the more well- known violations of international human rights initiated by Khomeini‚Äîthe fatwa to kill British-citizen author Salman Rushdie and the mass executions of leftist political prisoners in 1988‚Äîcan be explained best as a legacy for his followers. Abrahamian argues Khomeini wanted to \\"forge unity\\" among \\"his disparate followers\\", \\"raise formidable ‚Äì if not insurmountable ‚Äì obstacles in the way of any future leader hoping to initiate a detente with the West,\\" and most importantly to \\"weed out the half-hearted from the true believers\\",Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions by Ervand Abrahamian, University of California Press, 1999, p.218-9 such as heir-designate Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri who protested the killings and was dismissed from his position.Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions by Ervand Abrahamian, University of California Press, 1999, p.220-1 Economics In the realm of economics, Khomeini was known both for his lack of interest and conflicting views on the subject.Moin, Khomeini, (2001), p.258 He famously replied to a question before the revolution about how the Islamic Republic would manage Iran's economy by saying economics was \\"for donkeys\\"Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.134 (also translated as \\"for fools\\"economics is for fools (eqtesad mal-e khar ast) from Gheissari, Ali Democracy in Iran: history and the quest for liberty, Ali Gheissari, Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, Oxford University Press, 2006, p.87), and expressed impatience with those who complained about the inflation and shortages following the revolution saying: \\"I cannot believe that the purpose of all these sacrifices was to have less expensive melons,\\" (Khomeini July 1979) [quoted in The Government of God p.111. \\"see the FBIS for typical broadcasts, especially GBIS-MEA-79-L30, July 5, 1979 v.5 n.130, reporting broadcasts of the National Voice of Iran. His lack of attention has been described as \\"possibly one factor explaining the inchoate performance of the Iranian economy since the 1979 revolution,\\" (along with the mismanagement by clerics trained in Islamic law but not economic science). Khomeini has also been described as being \\"quite genuinely of two minds\\", and of having \\"ambiguous and contradictory attitudes\\" on the role of the state in the economy.Abrahamian, Khomeinism\\", p.38 He agreed with conservative clerics and the bazaar (traditional merchant class) on the importance of strict sharia law and respect for the sanctity of private property, but also made populist promises such as free water and electricity and government-provided homes for the poor, which could only be provided, if at all, by massive government intervention in the economy in violation of traditional Shariah law. While Khomeini was alive the conflict attitudes were represented in the clash between the populists of the Parliament and the conservatives of the Guardian Council.Abrahamian, Khomeinism, (p.55) After his death until 1997, the \\"bazaari side\\" of the legacy predominated with the regime of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, emphasized \`reconstruction,\` \`realism,\` \`work discipline,\` \`managerial skills,\` \`modern technology,\` \`expertise and competence,\` \`individual self-reliance,\` \`entrepreneurship,\` and \`stability.\`\\" Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.139 The populist side of Khomeini's economic legacy is said to be found in Iran's last president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who allegedly \\"mirrored\\" Khomeini's disdain for the \\"donkey\\" science of economics, wearing \\"his contempt for economic orthodoxy as a badge of honour\\", and overseeing sluggish growth and rising inflation and unemployment under his administration. Khomeini strongly opposed Marxism. \`Atheistic Marxists\` were the one group he excluded from the broad coalition of anti-Shah groups he worked to rally behind his leadership.Abrahamian Iran Between Revolutions (1982), p.479 In his last will and testament, he urged future generations to respect property on the grounds that free enterprise turns the \`wheels of the economy\` and prosperity would produce \`social justice\` for all, including the poor. > Islam differs sharply from communism. Whereas we respect private property, > communism advocates the sharing of all things ‚Äì including wives and > homosexuals.Abrahamian, Ervand, History of Modern Iran, Columbia University > Press, 2008, p.184 What one scholar has called the populist thrust of Khomeini can be found in the fact that after the revolution, revolutionary tribunals expropriated \\"agribusinesses, large factories, and luxury homes belonging to the former elite,\\" but were careful to avoid \\"challenging the concept of private property.\\" Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.42 On the other hand, Khomeini's revolutionary movement was influenced by Islamic leftist and thinker Ali Shariati, and the leftist currents of the 1960s and 1970s. Khomeini proclaimed Islam on the side of the mustazafin and against exploiters and imperialists.Abrahamian Iran Between Revolutions (1982), p.534 In part for this reason, a large section of Iran's economy was nationalized during the revolution.\\"Law for the Protection and Expansion of Iranian Industry\\" July 5, 1979 nationalization measure reportedly nationalized most of the privately industry and many non-industrial businesses. Mackey, Iranians, (1986) p.340 Today, Iran's public sector and government workforce remains very large. Despite complaints by free marketers, \\"about 60% of the economy is directly controlled and centrally planned by the state, and another 10‚Äì20% is in the hands of five semi-governmental foundations, who control much of the non-oil economy and are accountable to no one except the supreme leader.\\" Women in politics Before the Revolution, Khomeini expressed the following: > In an Islamic order, women enjoy the same rights as men ‚Äì rights to > education, work, ownership, to vote in elections and to be voted in. Women > are free, just like men to decide their own destinies and activities.Pithy > Aphorism: Wise Sayings and Counsels (by Khomeini), quoted in The Last Great > Revolution by Robin Wright c2000, p.152 After the Revolution, Khomeini opposed allowing women to serve in parliament, likening it to prostitution. > We are against this prostitution. We object to such wrongdoings ... Is > progress achieved by sending women to the majlis? Sending women to these > centers is nothing but corruption.Speech in Qom quoted in Esfandiari, Iran: > Women and Parliaments Under the Monarch and Islamic Republic pp.1‚Äì24, quoted > in The Last Great Revolution by Robin Wright c2000, p.151 =Religious philosophy, fiqh, teachings= Khomeini made a number of changes to Shia clerical system. Along with his January 1989 ruling that sharia was subordinate to the revolution, he affirmed against tradition that the fatwa pronounced by a grand ayatollah survived that ayatollah (such as the fatwa to kill Salman Rushdie), and defrocked Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, a political opponent. Fiqh In Fiqh, (Islamic jurisprudence) some scholars have argued Khomeini championed innovative reinterpretations of doctrine, prompted by the challenges of managing a country of 50 million plus. *Use of Maslaha, or maslahat (\`expedient interests\` or \`public welfare\`). This was a common concept among Sunni, but \\"before the 1979 revolution most\\" Shi'ite jurists had \\"rejected maslahat as a dangerous innovation (Bid‚Äòah).\\" Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini (2001), p.61 *Wider use of \\"secondary ordinances\\". Clerics had traditionally argued that the government could issue these \\"when addressing a narrow range of contractual issues not directly addressed in the Qur'an.\\" Khomeini called for their use to deal with the deadlock between the Majles and the Council of Guardians \`Khomeyni Addresses Majlis Deputies January 24\` broadcast 24 January 1983, quoted in Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini (2001), p.129 *Ijtihad Esmat Esmat is perfection through faith. Khomeini believed not only that truly just and divine Islamic government need not wait for the return of the 12th Imam/Mahdi, but that \\"divinely bestowed freedom from error and sin\\" (esmat) was not the exclusive property of the prophets and imams. Esmat required \\"nothing other than perfect faith\\"Dabashi, Theology of Discontent, p. 463, quoting Khomeini, Jehad-e Akbar (Greater Jihad), pp. 44 and could be achieved by a Muslim who reaches that state. Hamid Dabashi argues Khomeini's theory of Esmat from faith helped \\"to secure the all-important attribute of infallibility for himself as a member of the awlia' [friend of God] by eliminating the simultaneous theological and Imamological problems of violating the immanent expectation of the Mahdi.\\" (Dabashi, Theology of Discontent, p. 465 Thus by \\"securing\\" this \\"attribute of infallibility for himself\\", Khomeini reassured Shia Muslims who might otherwise be hesitant about granting him the same ruling authority due the 12 Imams. The Prophets Khomeini believed the Prophets have not yet achieved their \\"purpose\\". In November 1985 he told radio listeners, \\"I should say that so far the purpose of the Prophets has seldom been realized. Very little.\\" Aware of the controversial nature of the statement he warned more conservative clerics that \\"tomorrow court mullahs . . . [should] not say that Khomeini said that the Prophet is incapable of achieving his aims.\\" Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini p.133 He also controversially stated that Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad, was superior in status to the prophets of God. Khomeini's authority and charismatic personality prevented less popular jurists from protesting these changes as un-Islamic Bid‚Äòah. Istishhad =Iran‚ÄìIraq War= Perhaps the most significant legacy of Khomeini internationally is a broader definition of martyrdom to include Istishhad, or \\"self-martyrdom\\".Ruthven, Malise A Fury For God, Granta, (2002), p.? Khomeini believed martyrdom could come not only from \\"inadvertent\\" death but \\"deliberate\\" as well. While martyrdom has always been celebrated in Islam and martyrs promised a place in heaven, (Q3:169‚Äì171) the idea that opportunities for martyrdom were important has not always been so common. Khomeini not only praised the large numbers of young Shia Iranians who became \\"shahids\\" during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War but asserted the war was \\"God's hidden gift\\",Moin, Khomeini (200)) p.249, 251 or as one scholar of Khomeini put it, \\"a vital outlet through which Iran's young martyrs experienced mystical transcendence.\\"Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini p.123 Khomeini explained: > \\"If the great martyr (Imam Husayn ibn Ali) ... confined himself to praying > ... the great tragedy of Kabala would not have come about ... Among the > contemporary ulema, if the great Ayatollah ... Shirazi ... thought like > these people [who do not fight for Islam], a war would not have taken place > in Iraq ... all those Muslims would not have been martyred.\\" \`Ayatollah > Khomeyni Message to Council of Experts,\` broadcast 14 July 1983, FBIS- > SAS-83-137, 15 July 1983; Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeinip.130 Death might seem like a tragedy to some but in reality ... > If you have any tie or link binding you to this world in love, try to sever > it. This world, despite all its apparent splendor and charm, is too > worthless to be lovedIslam and Revolution, p.357 Khomeini never wavered from his faith in the war as God's will, and observers have related a number of examples of his impatience with those who tried to convince him to stop it. When the war seemed to become a stalemate with hundreds of thousands killed and civilian areas being attacked by missiles, Khomeini was approached by Ayatollah Mehdi Haeri Yazdi, a grand ayatollah and former student with family ties to Khomeini. He pleaded with Khomeini to find a way to stop the killing saying, \\"it is not right for Muslims to kill Muslims.\\" Khomeini answered reproachfully, asking him, \\"Do you also criticize God when he sends an earthquake?\\"Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.120 On another occasion a delegation of Muslim heads of state in Tehran to offer to mediate an end to the war were kept waiting for two hours and given no translator when Khomeini finally did talk to them.Niaz Naik, former Pakistan foreign secretary who accompanied General Zia on trip, in interview with Nasr in Lahore 1990. In Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, p.141 Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq While suicide martyrdom did not win the Iran‚ÄìIraq War for Iran, it did spread to Lebanon, where it won victories for the Iraqi Islamic Da'wa party, Shia 'allies' of the Islamic Revolution there. The 1983 bombings against U.S. and French peacekeeping troops by Hizballah killed over 300 and drove the US and French from Lebanon. Another longer bombing campaign did likewise to the Israeli army. Khomeini is credited by some with inspiring these \\"suicide bombers\\". The power of shaheed operations as a military tactic has been described by Shia Lebanese as an equalizer where faith and piety are used to counter superior military power of the Western unbeliever: > You look at it with a Western mentality. You regard it as barbaric and > unjustified. We, on the other hand, see it as another means of war, but one > which is also harmonious with our religion and beliefs. Take for example, an > Israeli warplane or, better still, the American and British air power in the > Gulf War. .... The goal of their mission and the outcome of their deeds was > to kill and damage enemy positions just like us ... The only difference is > that they had at their disposal state-of-the-art and top-of-the-range means > and weaponry to achieve their aims. We have the minimum basics ...

Unlike earlier Iranian shahs or the Awadh's nawabs, he never presided over any Ashura observances, nor visited the enormously popular shrine of the eighth Imam in Mashad. This discouraging of popular Shia piety and Shia traditions by Khomeini and his core supporters has been explained by at least one observer as a product of their belief that Islam was first and foremost about Islamic law,Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.135 and that the revolution itself was of \\"equal significance\\" to Battle of Karbala where the Imam Husayn was martyred.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.136 This legacy is reflected in the surprise sometimes shown by foreign Shia hosts in Pakistan and elsewhere when visiting Iranian officials, such as Fawzah Rafsanjani, show their disdain for Shia shrines. And perhaps also in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's May 2005 statement that \\"the Iranian revolution was of the same \`essence\` as Imam Husayn's movement.\\" =Sternness and austerity= Companions and followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini have many stories of his disinterest in his personal wealth and comfort and concern for others.Khomeini: life of the Ayatollah, By Baqer MoinRays of the Sun: 83 Stories from the Life of Imam Khomeini (ra) \\"He would never pass on his work to anyone else\\": While the Imam was sometimes flexible over doctrine, changing positions on divorce, music, birth control, he was much less accommodating with those he believed to be the enemies of Islam. Khomeini emphasized not only righteous militancy and rage but hatred, > And I am confident that the Iranian people, particularly our youth, will > keep alive in their hearts anger and hatred for the criminal Soviet Union > and the warmongering United States. This must be until the banner of Islam > flies over every house in the world. Wright, In the Name of God 1989, p.196 Salman Rushdie's apology for his book (following Khomeini's fatwa to kill the author) was rejected by Khomeini, who told Muslims: \\"Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time, it is incumbent on every Muslim to employ everything he has got, his life and wealth, to send him to Hell.\\" Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p.284 Khomeini felt let down by advisers who he felt had persuaded him to make unwise decisions against his better judgment, appointing people to posts who he later denounced. \\"I swear to God that I was against appointing Medi Bazargan as the first prime minister, too, but I considered him to be a decent person. I also swear to God that I did not vote for Bani Sadr to become president either. On all these occasions I submitted to the advice of my friends.\\" letter to Montazeri March 1989.

The following was published in 1942 and republished during his years as supreme leader: > Jihad or Holy War, which is for the conquest of [other] countries and > kingdoms, becomes incumbent after the formation of the Islamic state in the > presence of the Imam or in accordance with his command.

Also, he declared it permissible for Shiites to pray behind Sunni imams.\\"Islamonline. Frequently Asked Questions on Iran These measures have been viewed as being legitimised by the Shia practice of taqiyya (dissimulation), in order to maintain Muslim unity and fraternity. Shortly before he died the famous South Asian Islamist Abul Ala Maududi paid Khomeini the compliment of saying he wished he had accomplished what Khomeini had, and that he would have like to have been able to visit Iran to see the revolution for himself.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.138 He supported Unity WeekAnsari, Hamid, The Narrative of Awakening, The Institute for the Compilation and Publication of the works of the Imam Khomeini, (date?), p.253 and International Day of Quds.Palestine from the viewpoint of the Imam Khomeini, The Institute for the Compilation and Publication of the works of the Imam Khomeini, (date?), p.137 However, according to Sa\`id Hawwa in his book al-Khumayniyya, Khomeini's real aim was to spread Shi'ism through the use of such tactics as taqiyya and anti-Zionist rhetoric. This pan-Islamism did not extend to the Wahhabi regime of Saudi Arabia. Under his leadership the Iranian government cut relation with Saudi Arabia. Khomeini declared that Iran may one day start good diplomatic relation with the US or Iraq but never with Saudi Arabia. Iran did not re-establish diplomatic relation with Saudi Arabia until March 1991, after Khomeini's death. =Shia revival= The Iranian revolution \\"awakened\\" Shia around the world, who outside of Iran were subordinate to Sunnis. Shia \\"became bolder in their demands of rights and representations\\", and in some instances Khomeini supported them. In Pakistan, he is reported to have told Pakistan military ruler Zia ul-Haq that he would do to al-Haq \\"what he had done to the Shah\\" if al-Haq mistreated Shia.Interview by Vali Nasr with former Pakistani foreign minister Aghan Shahi, Lahore, 1989. from Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.138 When tens of thousands of Shia protested for exemption from Islamic taxes based on Sunni law, al-Haq conceded to their demands.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.138-9 Shia Islamist groups that sprang up during the 1980s, often \\"receiving financial and political support from Tehran\\" include the Amal Movement of Musa al-Sadr and later the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, Islamic Dawa Party in Iraq, Hizb-e Wahdat in Afghanistan, Tahrik-e Jafaria in Pakistan, al-Wifaq in Bahrain, and the Saudi Hezbollah and al- Haraka al-Islahiya al-Islamiya in Saudi Arabia. Shia were involved in the 1979‚Äì80 riots and demonstrations in oil-rich eastern Saudi Arabia, the 1981 Bahraini coup d'√©tat attempt and the 1983 Kuwait bombings.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.139 =Neither East nor West= Khomeini strongly opposed alliances with, or imitation of, Eastern (Communist) and Western Bloc (Capitalist) nations. > ... in our domestic and foreign policy, ... we have set as our goal the > world-wide spread of the influence of Islam ... We wish to cause the corrupt > roots of Zionism, capitalism and Communism to wither throughout the world. > We wish, as does God almighty, to destroy the systems which are based on > these three foundations, and to promote the Islamic order of the Prophet > ...Bayan, No.4 (1990), p.8) In the Last Message, The Political and Divine Will of His Holiness the Imam Khomeini, there are no less than 21 warnings on the dangers of what the west or east, or of pro-western or pro-eastern agents are either doing, have done or will do to Islam and the rest of the world.The Political and Divine Will of His Holiness the Imam Khomeini In particular he loathed the United States > ... the foremost enemy of Islam ... a terrorist state by nature that has set > fire to everything everywhere ... oppression of Muslim nations is the work > of the USA ...The Prologue to the Imam Khomeini's Last Will and Testament and its ally Israel > the international Zionism does not stop short of any crime to achieve its > base and greedy desires, crimes that the tongue and pen are ashamed to utter > or write. Khomeini believed that Iran should strive towards self-reliance. Rather siding with one or the other of the world's two blocs (at the time of the revolution), he favored the allying of Muslim states with each other, or rather their union in one state. In his book Islamic Government he hinted governments would soon fall into line if an Islamic government was established. > If the form of government willed by Islam were to come into being, none of > the governments now existing in the world would be able to resist it; they > would all capitulate.Khomeini, Islam and Revolution (1981), p.122 In the West While the Eastern or Soviet bloc no longer exists, Khomeini's legacy lives on in the Western world. From the beginning of the Iranian revolution to the time of his death Khomeini's \\"glowering visage became the virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture\\" and \\"inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam.\\" He is said to have made the word \`Ayatollah\` \\"a synonym for a dangerous madman ... in popular parlance.\\"His fatwa calling for the death of secular Muslim author Salman Rushdie in particular was seen by some as a deft attempt to create a wedge issue that would prevent Muslims from imitating the West by \\"dividing Muslims from Westerners along the default lines of culture.\\" The fatwa was greeted with headlines such as one in the popular British newspaper the Daily Mirror referring to Khomeini as \\"that Mad Mullah\\",February 15, 1989 observations in a British magazine that the Ayatollah seemed \\"a familiar ghost from the past ‚Äì one of those villainous Muslim clerics, a Faqir of Ipi or a mad Mullah, who used to be portrayed, larger than life, in popular histories of the British Empire\\",Anthony Harly, \\"Saving Mr. Rushdie?\\" Encounter, June 1989, p. 74 and laments that Khomeini fed the Western stereotype of \\"the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer.\\" Marzorati, Gerald, \\"Salman Rushdie: Fiction's Embattled Infidel\\", The New York Times Magazine, January 29, 1989, quoted in Pipes, The Rushdie Affair, (1990) The fatwa indicated Khomeini's contempt for the right to life; for the presumption of innocence; for the rule of law; and for national sovereignty, since he ordered Rushdie killed 'wherever he is found' Geoffrey Robertson, Mullahs without mercy, 2009 This was particularly the case in the largest nation of the Western bloc‚Äîthe United States (or \\"Great Satan\\")‚Äîwhere Khomeini and the Islamic Republic are remembered for the American embassy hostage taking and accused of sponsoring hostage-taking and terrorist attacks‚Äîespecially using the Lebanese Shi'a Islamic group HezbollahWright, Sacred Rage, (2001), p.28, 33,for example the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing see:Hizb'allah in Lebanon : The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis Magnus Ranstorp, Department of International Relations University of St. Andrews St. Martins Press, New York, 1997, p.54, 117‚Äîand which continues to apply economic sanctions against Iran. Popular feeling during the hostage-taking was so high in the United States that some Iranians complained that they felt the need to hide their Iranian identity for fear of physical attack even at universities.

The route runs from PA 896 in New London Township north to PA 41 in Londonderry Township. PA 796 heads through rural areas with some development along its route. In Jennersville, the route crosses Baltimore Pike and has an interchange with the U.S. Route 1 (US 1) freeway. PA 796 crosses PA 926 a short distance south of its northern terminus. PA 796 was originally designated by 1930 between the Maryland border near Kemblesville and north of Jennersville. In 1937, the southern terminus was moved to its current location, with PA 896 replacing the route south to the Maryland border, while the northern end was extended to PA 926 by 1940. PA 796 was extended north to PA 41 in the 1940s. Route description PA 796 northbound past Baltimore Pike in Jennersville PA 796 begins at an intersection with PA 896 in New London Township, Chester County, heading north on two-lane undivided Jennersville Road. The route soon crosses into Penn Township and curves northeast through a mix of fields and woods with some development. In the residential community of Kelton, PA 796 comes to a bridge over an East Penn Railroad line. The road continues north and passes residential neighborhoods and commercial establishments along with some farms. PA 796 reaches the community of Jennersville, where it gains a center left-turn lane and crosses Baltimore Pike. The route comes to an interchange with the US 1 freeway a short distance later. Following this, the road narrows back to two lanes and heads north through agricultural areas with some woods and homes. PA 796 crosses into Londonderry Township and curves northwest. The route curves north again and crosses PA 926. PA 796 continues to its northern terminus at PA 41, where the road continues as unnumbered Derry Meeting Road. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, present-day PA 796 was not legislated as part of any route. By 1928, the current route of PA 796 was paved between the southern terminus and north of Jennersville; at this time it did not carry a route number. By 1930, PA 796 was designated to run from the Maryland border southeast of Kemblesville north to a point north of Jennersville, heading through Kemblesville and New London before picking up its current alignment. In 1937, the southern terminus was cut back to its current location, with an extended PA 896 replacing the route south of that point. By 1940, the northern terminus was extended to PA 926 along a newly- paved road. The route was extended north to PA 41 along a paved road during the 1940s. By 1970, the interchange with the US 1 freeway was built, with the route having previously intersected US 1 at the Baltimore Pike intersection.

Biography Gerbet was born at Poligny, Jura. He studied at the Acad√©mie and the Grand-S√©minaire of Besan√ßon, also at St-Sulpice and the Sorbonne. Ordained priest in 1822, he joined Lamennais at \\"La Chesnaie\\" (1825) after a few years spent with Antoine de Salinis at the Lyc√©e Henri IV. An admirer of Lamennais, he nevertheless accepted the papal encyclical Mirari vos of 15 August 1832, and the Singulari nos of 13 July 1834, which condemned the traditionalism of Lamennais. After fruitless efforts to convert the master, he withdrew to the Coll√®ge de Juilly (1836). The years 1839-49 he spent in Rome, gathering data for his \\"Esquisse de Rome Chr√©tienne\\". Recalled by Monseigneur Sibour, he became successively professor of sacred eloquence at the Sorbonne, Vicar-General of Amiens, and bishop of Perpignan (1854). His episcopate was marked by the holding of a synod (1865), the reorganization of clerical studies, various religious foundations, and by the pastoral instruction of 1860 sur diverses erreurs du temps pr√©sent, which served as a model for the Syllabus of Pope Pius IX. He died at Perpignan, Pyr√©n√©es Orientales, aged 66. Besides many articles in \\"Le M√©morial catholique\\", \\"L'Avenir\\", \\"L'Universit√© catholique\\", and some philosophical writings (\\"Des doctrines philosophiques sur la certitude\\", Paris, 1826; \\"Summaire des connaissances humaines\\", Paris, 1829; \\"Coup d'oeil sur la controverse chr√©tienne\\", Paris, 1831; \\"Pr√©cis d'histoire de la philosophie\\", Paris, 1834; under the names of Salinis and Scorbiac), all more or less tinctured with the thought of Lamennais, he wrote the following: \\"Consid√©rations sur le dogme g√©n√©rateur de la pi√©t√© chr√©tienne\\" (Paris, 1829); \\"Vues sur la P√©nitence\\" (Paris, 1836) ‚Äî these two works are often published together; \\"Esquisse de Rome Chr√©tienne\\" (Paris, 1843), previously mentioned. In the two former books Gerbet views the dogmas of the Eucharist and Penance as admirably fitted to develop the affections ‚Äî nourrir le coeur de sentiments ‚Äî just as he uses the r√©alit√©s visibles of Rome as symbols of her essence spirituelle. Sainte-Beuve (Causeries de lundi, VI, 316) says that certain passages of Gerbet's writings \\"are among the most beautiful and suave pages that ever honoured religious literature\\". Gerbet's \\"Mandements et instructions pastorales\\" were published at Paris in 1876.

The first rebbe of this dynasty was Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner, author of Mei Hashiloach, in the city of Izhbitza. (Izhbitza is the Yiddish name of Izbica, located in present-day Poland). Rabbi Mordechai Yosef founded his own Hasidic movement in the year 5600 (1839), with Rabbi Mordechai Yosef leaving the court of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk. His son and successor, Rabbi Yaakov Leiner of Izhbitza, moved to Radzin. The dynasty today is therefore known more as the \\"Radziner Dynasty\\". The third Rebbe, Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner of Radzin, re-instituted the use of techeiles of the tzitzis. The more known works of the Izhbitzer-Radziner Rebbeim are Mei Hashiloach, Beis Yaakov, Sod Yesharim, and Tiferes Yosef. Today, the largest center of Radziner Hasidim is found in Bnei Brak, Israel, under the leadership of Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Englard of Radzin.  History  = First generation = The Izhbitzer-Radziner dynasty was established on Succos 5600 (1839) by Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner, author of the \\"Mei Hashiloach\\". He was a close disciple of Rabbi Simcha Bunim of Peshischa. After Rav Simcha Bunim's death, Rav Mordechai Yosef joined the court of his long-time childhood friend, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk. The Kotzker Rebbe appointed him to guide the young chassidim who joined the ranks in Kotzk. When the Kotzker Rebbe began distancing himself from his chassidim, Rav Mordechai Yosef felt it was time for him to begin leading those who were in need of a Rebbe. He left Kotzk, settling in Izhbitza, being known hence as the \\"Izhbitzer Rebbe\\". The Mei Hashiloach died 7 Teves 5614 (1854), and was buried in Izhbitza. A number of years after his death a small part of his ideas were put to writing by his grandson, Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner of Radzin. = Second generation = After the death of the Mei Hashiloach, most of his followers appointed his eldest son, Rabbi Yaakov Leiner, author of \\"Beis Yaakov\\" and \\"Sefer Hazemanim\\", as Izhbitzer Rebbe. He expanded vastly the Torah of his father, and constantly spoke Torah to his chassidim. During his days the numbers of Izhbitzer Chassidim grew vastly, as he was much more accommodating for newcomers. Many of his thoughts were later published in Beis Yaakov, by his son and successor, Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner of Radzin. The Beis Yaakov died 15 Av 5638 (1878) in Druzgenik, Lithuania, and was buried in the nearby village of Rotnica, Lithuania. = Third generation = After the death of the Beis Yaakov, his followers appointed his eldest son, Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner, author of \\"Orchos Chayim\\" (on the Tzava'ah - the will - of the Tana Rabbi Eliezer HaGadol) as his successor. He was the first rebbe in the dynasty known as \\"The Radziner Rebbe\\". Rav Gershon Henoch was a student of his grandfather and father. The Rebbe is referred to by Radziner Chasidim as the \\"Orchos Chayim\\", based on his above-mentioned work. (When the Rebbe published this work, he commented to his brother that he's happy that he got to print his Tzava'ah). In the larger world, the Rebbe is better known as the Ba'al HaTecheiles. He led his followers with a more extreme leadership, similar to that of his grandfather, differing from his father's style. The Orchos Chaim died 4 Teves 5651 (1890), and was buried in Radzin. = Fourth generation = After the death of the Orchos Chaim, his followers appointed his only son, Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Elazar Leiner, the \\"Tiferes Yosef\\", as Radziner Rebbe. The Tiferes Yosef led his followers with a very calm leadership. Thus in his days Radziner Chassidim numbered in the thousands. He was very instrumental in the establishment of Agudat Yisrael, and served as its vice president until his death. During World War I he moved to Warsaw, leading his followers from there. The Rebbe re-instituted the famous shiurim on the Talmud, based on chassidic approaches, which were popular during the times of the Mei HaShiloach. Many of these shiurim were later printed in his sefer, Tiferes Yosef. The Tiferes Yosef died on 26 Shevat 5689 (1929), and was buried in Warsaw. = Fifth generation = After the death of the Tiferes Yosef, his followers appointed his only son, Rabbi Shmuel Shlomo Leiner, as Radzyner Rebbe. At first, the Rebbe refused to take over his father's position. Only due to the enormous pressure put on him by the thousands of Radziner Chassidim, did he finally consent. The final push was the pressure put on him by his great-uncle, Rav Mottel Leiner, son of the Beis Yaakov, and Rav Michel Rashes of Brisk, one of the most prominent Radziner Chassidim. The Rebbe led his followers with a very sharp and extreme leadership, similar to that of his grandfather, the Orchos Chaim. This caused many chassidim to have to leave Radzin. The Rebbe went as far as to close various shteiblach, which he believed were not appropriate of being called Radziner Shtieblech. His greatest strength of character was brought to light during the years of the holocaust. The Rebbe was known for encouraging resistance to the orders of the Nazis and the Judenrat, and for urging people to break out of the ghettos, flee to the forests and take up arms. The Nazis searched for him intensively, and he was eventually shot to death on 29 Iyar 5702 (1942). He was buried in Wladawa. = Radzin post-Holocaust = After the Holocaust, the surviving Izhbitzer-Radziner Chassidim crowned Rabbi Avrohom Yissochor Englard (1905-2005), son-in-law of the Tiferes Yosef, as Radziner Rebbe. The Rebbe was also the great-grandson of the second Radomsker Rebbe, Rabbi Avraham Yissachar Dov Rabinowicz, author of the Chessed Le'avrohom.\\"A World That Was\\", Hamodia Magazine, 21 July 2011, p. 7. In pre-war Radzin, he was appointed by his brother-in-law, Rabbi Shmuel Shlomo of Radzin, to head the network of Radziner Yeshivos Sod Yesharim. According to the elder chassidim, Rav Shmuel Shlomo crowned him during the Holocaust, before his death, to lead in his place. Under his leadership, the Izhbitzer-Radziner Dynasty rebuilt itself, with the Center of Radziner Institutions being established in Bnei Brak. The Rebbe also established Radziner Shtieblech in many cities where Radziner Hassidim were concentrated. This includes Jerusalem, Haifa, Netanya, Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak, Holon and Petah Tikva. The Rebbe also re-established the Radziner Yeshiva Sod Yesharim in Jerusalem. In Bnei Brak he established the Radziner Yeshiva Ateres Shlomo, and the Radziner Yeshiva Tiferes Yosef, with many Kollelim located in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, and Haifa. An important achievement of Rav Avrohom Yissachar was the re-institution of the dyeing of the techeiles. Much effort was put in by him to re establish the exact procedure as was done in prewar Radzin. Due to his countless efforts, the establishment of the \\"Center for the Dyeing of the Techeiles\\" was completed in Bnei Brak. The Rebbe appointed his son, Rabbi Yitzchok Englard, to head this institution. Rav Avraham Yissachar led his followers with a calm and loving leadership, similar to that of his father-in-law, the Tiferes Yosef. The Rebbe died 20 Tishrei 5766 (2005), and was buried in the Rabbinical section (Chelkas HoRabbanim) of Har HaMenuchos, Jerusalem. Grand Rabbi Avrohom Yissochor Englard of Radzin = Radzin today = After the death of Rabbi Avrohom Yissochor of Radzin, his followers crowned his son, Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Englard, as Radziner Rebbe. He currently resides in Bnei Brak, leading the Radziner Chassidim from the Central Radziner Institution. The Radziner Shtieblech continue to thrive in various cities. In Yerushalayim, the eldest grandson of Rav Avrohom Yissochor, Rabbi Nosson Nochum Englard, was appointed as Radziner Rav, leading the Radziner Shtiebel and community there. Chanukkah Tisch 5769 (2008) Grand Rabbi Avraham Yissachor Englard of Radzin with his eldest grandson Rabbi Nosson Nochum Englard of Radzin-Yerushalayim (seated right)  Additional Branch of Radzin  In the third generation, after the death of the Orchos Chaim, his younger brother, Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heshel Leiner, became Rebbe in the city of Chelm. He was one of the top students of his older brother, the Orchos Chaim. After his death on 27 Shevat 5680 (1920), two of his sons became Rebbe in Chelm, Rabbi Gedalya and Rabbi Ovadya. A number of years later, his son, Rabbi Yeruchem Leiner, became Radziner Rebbe in Cricklewood, England. After the holocaust, he relocated to the Boro Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, opening a Radziner Shtiebel there. His ideas were later published in \\"Tiferes Yeruchem\\". After his death on 20 Av 5724 (1964), his son, Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner, took his place, until his death on 3 Shevat 5751 (1991). After Rabbi Mordechai Yosef's death, his eldest son, Rabbi Yaakov Leiner, became Radziner Rebbe, until his sudden death on 5 Iyar 5769 (2009). Rav Yaakov studied at Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, and then at Rabbi Nosson Dovid Rabinowitz's kollel in Shaarei Chesed. He received semichos from the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Rabbi Yitzchok Kolitz and Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg. In the summer of 1996, he left the kollel to learn for six years in Beth Medrash Govoah in Lakewood, New Jersey, once again reuniting with a Radziner, the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Yerucham Olshin. During those six years he reviewed his Yoreh Deah many times and went through many Talmudic tractates. In 1992, at the age of 30, he married Miriam, of the Bookson family of Monsey, New York. They had ten children. Rabbi Yaakov published all the writings of his grandfather, Rabbi Yeruchem, a few months before the former's death and considered that work to be his crowning achievement. After Rabbi Yaakov's death, his ideas were published in \\"Tiferes Yaakov\\". Rabbi Moshe Leiner, second son of Rabbi Mordechai Yosef, serves as Radziner Rebbe in the Bayit VeGan neighborhood of Yerushalayim. Among many other noted Talmudic academies, Rav Moshe learned at the Yeshiva of Rabbi Meir Soloveitchik in Yerushalayim. Grand Rabbi Yerucham Leiner of Radzin BP Grand Rabbi Yaakov Leiner of Radzin BP Grand Rabbi Moshe Leiner of Radzin, about to give over a Dvar Torah at Tish for the Yahrtzeit of the Mei HaShiloach 7 Teves 5768 (2008)  Biskivitz-Reivitz branch  In the second generation, after the death of the Beis Yaakov, his younger brother, Rabbi Shmuel Dov Asher Leiner, became Rebbe to a small and select group. At first he remained in Izhbitza, moving shortly after to the city of Biskivitz. The Biskivitzer Rebbe's ideas were printed in \\"Naos Deshe\\". He died Acharaon Shel Pesach, 22 Nisan 5665 (1905), and was buried in Biskivitz. After the death of the Naos Deshe, his followers appointed his nephew, Rabbi Moshe Chaim Sochachevsky, in his place. Rav Moshe Chaim was a son-in-law of the Beis Yaakov, and a grandson of Rabbi Dovid Sochachevski, father-in-law of the Beis Yaakov. Rav Moshe Chaim relocated to the city of Reivitz, hence being known as the Reivitzer Rebbe. After his death, his son, Rabbi Yehoshua Avraham Alter Sochachevski, became Reivitzer Rebbe. In his later years, he moved to Chelm. The Reivitzer Rebbe, with his children and son-in-law, Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner, (son of Rabbi Chanina Dovid Leiner of Tomashov), were killed by the Nazi murderers.  Extended family  Here is a list of additional family members not mentioned above: *** Rabbi Akiva Tannenbaum of Mord the son of Rabbi Nateh Tannenbaum of Mord, and son-in-law of the \\"Bais Yaakov\\", was one of the respected chassidim of the Mei Hashiloach (his grand father-in-law), and a descendant of Hagaon Rabbi Akiva Eiger zt\\"l. * One of Rabbi Akiva Tannenbaum‚Äôs decedents, Rabbi Elchanan Tuvyah Tannenbaum escaped the fiery ovens of the Nazis and settled in N.Y. with the intention of rebuilding the Radziner dynasty. Rabbi Elchanan Tuvyah, his son Reb. Yosef Aryeh, and grandson Reb. Moshe Mordechia worked tirelessly in building a Shul (Synagogue) on the upper West Side of Manhattan. From letters found in Bnei Brak, Israel we know that Rabbi Elchanan Tuvyah worked tirelessly to move Rabbi Shmuel Shlomo Leiner (the son of Rabbi Mordechia Yosef Alazer and grandson of the Baal Hatecheiles) to safety in the USA. But Rabbi Shmuel Shlomo refused saying his place was with his chassidim. After the passing of Rabbi Shmuel Shlomo at the hands of the Nazis, Rabbi Elchanan Tuvyah, being of the elders of Radzin, lead the group crowning Rabbi Avrohom Yissachor Englard (brother-in-law of Rabbi Shmuel Shlomo) as the Radziner Rebbe. Rabbi Elchanan Tuvyah went as far as giving the new Radziner Rebbe his own talis that had techeiles from the Baal Hatecheiles, Rabbi Gershon Chanoch Henach Leiner. This talis was worn by the Radziner Rebbe only on special occasions. Rabbi Elchanan Tuvyah's great grandchildren (sons of Reb. Moshe Mordechia Tannenbaum) A. Elchanan Tuvyah C. and A.
