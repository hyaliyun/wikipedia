Biography Bide was born at 3 Blithfield Street, Kensington, on 11 September 1915, the son of Ernest Arthur Bide and his wife, Eliza, n√©e Young. He was brought up by his mother after his father, a gardener who had become a lance bombardier in the Royal Garrison Artillery, was killed in France in October 1918. After attending Acton County Grammar School, Bide joined the Laboratory of the Government Chemist at age 16, while also studying in the evenings for a chemistry degree. He was awarded a first in 1939. In 1940 he joined Glaxo Laboratories and, as part of the war effort, worked on the synthesis of vitamin B1 and the development of penicillin. In 1944 he was appointed as department head, with responsibility for patents and chemical development, thus beginning his career in management. In 1951 he was entrusted with supervising the construction of a new factory at Montrose, Angus.Reports differ as to the purpose of the factory: some say to manufacture cortisone, others say penicillin. Three years later he was back in London, first as deputy company secretary, then company secretary in 1959, and a director in 1963. He became deputy chairman in 1971. Bide was heavily involved when Beecham launched the biggest ever takeover bid for Glaxo. It was blocked by the Monopolies Commission in 1972 on the grounds that it would damage the UK's research into new drugs. Bide became chairman and chief executive of Glaxo in 1973, and immediately put in place a process of structural reform by rationalising Glaxo‚Äôs technical divisions. He retired in 1985 and, controversially, was named life president. Bide had been knighted in 1980. He then started a second career by becoming deputy chairman of BL, a large and largely failing car manufacturer. He was appointed by Sir Michael Edwardes, by whom he was greatly valued. Even so, he failed to get the whole or parts of the company sold. Family On 28 June 1941 he married Irene Ward (b. 22 September 1920),1939 England and Wales Register a milliner, and daughter of Ernest Auckland Ward, upholsterer; they had three daughters: Ann {1946), Susan (1951) and Patricia (1958}. Sir Austin Bide died on 11 May 2008 in St. Anthony's Hospital, North Cheam, of bronchopneumonia following a stroke; he was survived by his wife and their three daughters. Lady Irene died on 13th November 2013, aged 93. She was survived by her three daughters and six grandchildren.

It is one of the most important Orthodox shrines of pilgrimage in Greece. The shrine is dedicated to the Mother of God of the Life-giving Spring Orthodox wiki article about Life- Giving spring. It is built on a steep cliff almost 30 meters high, near to sea. The many and impressive miracles which occur through the intercessions of the Virgin Mother have consecrated the church in the conscience of the faithful as a national shrine. Thousands of believers, from all over Greece, arrive at Aigio on Bright Friday every year, to get Panagia's grace and to get Her blessing. In the 14th volume of the French monthly magazine Revue des deux Mondes of the year 1876 it is mentioned that it was a big fest for the people of Aeghion Revue des deux Mondes, TOME QUATORZI√àME, 1876,(Link to books.google.com digital library) \\"grande f√™te locale √† Aigion ... D√®s le matin, tous les habitans, hommes, femmes, enfans, s'y rendent en p√®lerinage; puis tous reviennent ensemble au milieu des fusillades et des d√©tonations des varellota (petit baril)\\". It even mentions the use of firecrackers that day. This day every year there is a procession of the Holy Icon through the streets of Aigio and it is an official religious holiday (recognized as an official holiday by a Royal decree of 8 May 1933). The name Trypiti comes from the Greek word tripa () meaning hole, cave, because the miraculous icon of Panagia was found in a hole in the rock. In the narthex of the church (which is on the ground floor) there is a spring of water ().The faithful drink this water as a blessing since it is believed that it works miraculous cures. History The church was built on the site where the grace-filled Icon of Panagia was miraculously discovered in the middle of the sixteenth century by a voyager who was ship-wrecked off the shores of the Corinthian Gulf. In the darkness of the night the castaway saw from far a strong light shining near the shore. This light fitted him with courage and determination. When he finally made his way ashore he managed to reach the place where the light shone and there he was amazed to find himself before an icon of Panagia which was surrounded by light. The shipwrecked kneeled down and prayed. Out of gratitude he contributed money for the erection of a small chapel on the spot. The shipwrecked became the first monk and servant of the Virgin Mary and he lived all his life in an asceterion just behind the church. The first church was intended to be built beside the place where the icon was found (because of the morphology of the rock) but miraculously few days after the start of the construction works, there was enough space exactly on the place of the icon in the rock for building a small church. This church in the rock is till today the heart of the shrine but later in the 19th century it was expanded and took the form that it has today. Restoration works As of 2019, the church is not open to visitors due to restoration works. The restoration project has a budget of 1,200,000 euros and it is expected to be completed in 2023. The funding of the project comes from the European Territorial Cooperation programm Interreg Greece - Italy 2014 -2020.Interreg Greece-Italy Programme 2014-2020 Cross-border Cooperation Programme between Greece and Italy co- funded by the European Union, Official website Till the completion of the works, the holy icon of Panagia Trypiti has been transferred to Panagia Faneromeni church in the centre of Aigio. The restoration project includes the installation of external elevators, car parking lot, renovation of flower beds and gardens, restoration of all the mural paintings and all icons, maintenance of roofs, external paintings of the church, and general maintenance of all the buildings beside the main church building.Aigio: Elevator, parking and rock support in Panagia Tripiti - The implementation of the restoration project begins, Article in Achaia local newspaper Peloponnisos, 05/04/2020 (in Greek) Gallery File:Church of Panagia Tripiti the Life Giving Spring in Aigio.jpgThe sacred shrine of Panagia Trypiti File:View of the port from the gardens of Panagia Trypiti shrine.jpgView of the port of Aigio from the gardens of the shrine of Panagia Trypiti File:Agiasma panagia trypiti 2.jpgthumbThe sacred spring at the entrance of the church of Panagia Trypiti.

The territory is the traditional homeland of the Murrawarri people, an Aboriginal nation, but the population now comprises mostly non-Indigenous Australians. The Government of Australia has not acknowledged the declaration of independence, and their independence has been wholly unrecognised. Declaration of the Continuance of the State of Murrawarri Nation On 30 March 2013, the Murrawarri Republic released a declaration announcing its independence. The Peoples Council of the Murrawarri gave the Queen of England [sic] (Elizabeth II), the Prime Minister of Australia (Julia Gillard), as well as the Premiers of Queensland (Campbell Newman) and New South Wales (Barry O'Farrell) 21 days to respond to the declaration. The specific requests made to Queen Elizabeth II were: * Treaty documents between the Murrawarri Nation and the Crown of Great Britain outlining the conditions of such a treaty, * A Deed of Cession document that show the Murrawarri Nation has ceded Sovereignty, Dominion and Ultimate (Radical) to the Crown of Great Britain, or * Documents showing a declaration of war against the Murrawarri Nation and its people by the Crown of Great Britain. The deadline expired on 8 May 2013, with the Crown failing to give a response. The Council interpreted their failure to produce the requested documents to be affirmation by the Crown of \\"the Murrawarri Republic to be a continued Free and Independent State, in line with International law and covenants\\". On May 12, 2013, the Murrawarri people took their sovereignty campaign to the United Nations, asking that they be recognized as the world's newest country. On 13 May 2013, the Murrawarri Republic established a Ministry of Defence. The Declaration of Continued Independence, states that there shall be a referendum for the establishment of the elected not later than 1 April 2014 and that until such a referendum the People's Council shall act as the governing body. On 30 May 2013, Time reported that Attorney-General‚Äôs Department of the Australian Government had not replied because there was no legal basis for a reply, a view backed by George Newhouse, a Sydney-based human-rights lawyer known for his work with indigenous Australians. Geography The Murrawarri Republic website identifies its territory as being roughly triangular in shape, traversing the Queensland/New South Wales border with its easterly apex close to the two state borders about 600 km from the Pacific Ocean, on the landward side of the Great Dividing Range, its north-westerly apex close to the Queensland town of Cunnamulla and its southwesterly apex at the confluence of the Darling and Warrego Rivers. It is roughly 200 km from east to west and about 250 km from north to south. The republic‚Äôs website quotes its area as being , but this area is inconsistent with measurements taken from the map.The area of quoted on the website does not correspond with the coordinates cited in the same website. If the territory claimed is approximated by a triangle with its northerly apex at , its southerly apex at (quoted in the website) and its easterly coordinate at (estimated using A55 and A71 highways as reference points), the triangle will have sides of 263.3 km, 186.5 km and 254.6 km respectively. Using Heron's formula, such a triangle has an area of about , significantly less than the quoted area of the territory--namely . The inconsistency between Murrawarri's land claim and the claimed land's true area has been specifically examined in a study published by Indigenous Policy Journal, which confirms that Murrawarri's true area is about , less than one third of what is officially claimed. The study also concluded that \\"the proclamation of the Republic of Murrawarri is currently exerting a significant influence over similar contexts in Australia\\", thus reinforcing the debate on Aboriginal sovereignty. The First Peoples Worldwide website quotes the population of the Murrawarri republic as being approximately 4000, but this value is inconsistent with census figures.Maps published by the Murrawarri Provisional Council of State show that most, if not all, of the republic lies within the Shire of Paroo (Queensland) or Bourke Shire (New South Wales): the 2010 census quotes the Shire of Paroo as having a population of 1951 and Bourke Shire as having a population of 2868. Of this total of 4819, 3362 (or 69.76%) of the population of these shires are shown as living in the towns of Bourke and Cunnamulla, which lie outside the republic, leaving a population of about 1450. The dominant vegetation and climate, based on the K√∂ppen classification, is described as hot, persistently dry grassland. The average maximum and minimum temperatures in January are about 36¬∞C and 18¬∞C respectively and in July are 22¬∞C and 5¬∞C respectively. The rainfall is approximately 360 mm per annum, with more rain falling in the summer than in the winter.These figures are the averages of the figures for Bourke and Cunnamulla. The Mitchell Highway (A71) traverses the territory from north to south. Provisional Council of State The Provisional Council of State is the governing body of the Murrawarri Republic. The first meeting of the People's Council was held at Weilmoringle on 13 July 2013, where the meeting passed a unanimous resolution to establish the Provisional Council of State. It is made up of 11 members who are Fred Hooper, Kevin Hooper, Phyllis Cubby, Evelyn Barker, Sam Jefferies, Desmond Jones, Phillip Sullivan, Julie Johnston, Gloria Johnston, Sharni Hooper, and Alison Salt. Fred Hooper is the current chairman of the Provisional Council of State. Flag meaning The brown and the light blue represent mother earth. The brown representing the land and the light blue as the sky from where Murrawarri spirits reside until their return on the falling star, as well as the water and the people. The white star in the upper left corner has eight points which represent the eight clan groups of the Murrawarri Republic.

In the United States it was released under the alternative title Hideout in the Alps. It was based on the play of the same title by Neil Grant. Production The film was produced by Julius Hagen, the owner of a film production empire based around Twickenham Studios. The film was shot at one of his other studios, located in the Elstree complex, and also included extensive location filming in the Alps.Richards p.194 It was directed by Vorhaus who had worked on a number of earlier films for the company. Vorhaus was so impressed by the performance of Margaret Rutherford in a theatre production he saw her in, that he insisted on casting her in the film. He added a new comic relief role to the original play especially for her.Richards p.181 & 194 The film's art direction was by Andrew Mazzei. Hagen had an ambitious programme of films for 1936, but his failure to secure effective distribution led to financial problems and the collapse of his company the following year during the Slump of 1937.Richards p.50-55 Vorhaus directed one further British film, Cotton Queen, before returning to America. Synopsis After being released from prison Jim Kent, a leading forger, is approached by an international counterfeiting organisation. He rejects their offer of employment as he intends to go straight, but when he discovers that his nephew is now working for the outfit he travels to Switzerland to try to help him out. An ambitious young detective from Scotland Yard is also on the trail of the forgery ring, and mistakenly comes to the conclusion that Jim Kent is still working as a master counterfeiter.

During the early 1960s, he with Ishwor Ballav and Indra Bahadur Rai searched unexplored realms of Nepali literature. They added a new dimension ‚Äì the third dimension ‚Äì to Nepalese literature.gorkhapedia.wikidot.com He is currently working in the field of Folklore of Limbu ethnic people of Eastern Nepal. He is also working to promote the culture, language and literature of the minor community, nationalities and indigenous people of Nepal. Bairagi Kainla was nominated as a member of the Royal Nepal Academy in 1990. Early life and education Bairagi Kainla's house, known as Building Ghar, Kainla's Birthplace, in Panchthar Bairagi Kainla was born in 1939 and learnt his first letters at home. He was taught by local teachers. He lived in a joint family and his father had six wives. Kainla's father was quite ahead of his times. He was liberal enough to send him to study Science in Darjeeling. But more than formal studies, Kainla became busy in literary programmes. In Darjeeling, Kainla met Indra Bahadur Rai and Ishwar Ballav in college whose encouragement became pivotal in shaping his poet-personality. These trio's incessant debates on writing incited the publishing of their magazine titled Phool Paat Patkar where they published poetry, essays and short stories. Born in joint family, Kainla grew up with eight brothers and six sisters. Always having someone around him was the best part of being grown up in big family, Kainla remembers. He also remembers that the sad part of big family was that the women in the family had to wake up around four o'clock in the morning and start their daily chores. He recalls that his father was among the first of Limbu to emphasize education and he had sent his children far away from home for further studies. His father had also published the first Limbu lyrical poetry Kirat Mikhan Samlo (Kirat Jagaran Geet) which was later translated to Devnagari by Kainla in 2038 BS. In conversation with Para Limbu, Chairperson of Spiny Babbler, he said, He studied Science and completed Intermediate of Science (ISc) from Darjeeling Government College affiliated to Calcutta University.

Kainla published lot of his work in them. The Third Dimension (Tesro Aayam) Kainla met Indra Bahadur Rai and Ishwor Ballav in college in Darjeeling, whose encouragement became pivotal in shaping his poet-personality. Their incessant debates on writing incited the publishing of their magazine Phool Paat Patkar with their pocket money where they published poetry, essays and short stories. Kainla formed a trio with Indra Bahadur Rai and Ishwor Ballav who came like a thunder with new literary trend and a powerful movement called Tesro Aayam (The Third Dimension). In 1963 AD, Kainla, Rai and Ballav first experimented with Tesro Aayam writing. They started the Aayameli movement from Darjeeling with the publication of a journal titled Tesro Aayam triggering a theoretical jolt in Nepali literature at the time. Kainla did not write much, whatever he wrote he did most powerfully. He hails from Limbu community of eastern Nepal. He uses local myths and lore in his poetry leading to a diversion in traditional writing. Kainla's poetry is the song of freedom. He is a great freedom-fighter and participated actively in different movements. Deep undertone of love and revolt can be heard in his work. His poems of Bairagi kainlakaa Kavitaharu contains some masterpieces in Nepali. Chancellor of the Nepal Academy Kainla served as a Chancellor of Nepal Academy from 2066 BS to 2070 BS.

Biography Born in Trieste to a Gorizian father of Jewish descentGruber, Ruth Ellen. Jewish Heritage Travel: A Guide to East-Central Europe. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc, 1992 and a Genoese mother, Dorfles graduated in medicine, specializing in psychiatry. He was a professor in aesthetics at the University of Trieste, Milan and Cagliari and, in 1948, established the MAC (Movimento per l'arte concreta) with artists Atanasio Soldati, Galliano Mazzon, Gianni Monnet, and Bruno Munari. His paintings were displayed in two personal exhibitions held in Milan in 1949 and 1950 and also in numerous collective MAC exhibitions in the 1950s. In 1956 Dorfles co-founded the ADI (Associazione per il disegno industriale). Having stopped painting, he devoted himself to the study of aesthetics and art criticism, dealing with the problem of the vanguard, the relationship between art and industry, analyzing artistic phenomena, and tastes in the contemporary society. According to Dorfles, aesthetics should focus on culture as a whole, which combine elements of fantasy, symbolic, metaphorical and even mythical suggestions. Among his major works, L'architettura moderna (1954), Kitsch (originally published in Italian in 1968 and translated in English the following year), La moda della moda (1984), Il feticcio quotidiano (1988), Horror pleni. La (in)civilt√† del rumore (2008). In the same period, however, Dorfles continued to hold personal exhibitions: in 1986 his works were displayed in Milan, in 1988 in Aosta, and in 1996 in Rome. In 2010, for his 100th birthday celebrations, L'avanguardia tradita took place at the Royal Palace of Milan. Another exhibition was held in 2012 at the Triennale di Milano, organized by Dorfles himself, entitled Dorfles. Kitsch ‚Äì oggi il kitsch. At 103, Dorfles published a new book (Poesie, Campanotto Editore, 2013), containing previously unpublished poems written from 1941 to 1952.

It is endemic to Taiwan. Taxonomy It has been suggested that Pareas chinensis should be treated as a synonym of P. formosensis, but recent genetic research does not support this: P. formosensis does not appear closely related to P. chinensis but is instead a sister species to P. hamptoni. The delineation of these species is not clear. In future, P. formosensis might become a subspecies of P. hamptoni, or some snakes from the mainland might be classified as P. formosensis. Further studies have shown that Pareas komaii is a valid species, instead of being a synonym of P. formosensis. The study also described a new species, Pareas atayal, that have been confused with P. formosensis. Thus, three Pareas species occur in Taiwan. Description The Formosa slug snake is a small snake with total length up to . These snakes are widespread in mountainous, moist forests. Formosa slug snakes are nocturnal and feed on land snails and slugs. Female snakes produce a clutch of 2‚Äì9 eggs; the hatchlings measure about in total length. P. formosensis is readily distinguished from P. komaii and P. atayal by its red iris and totally smooth dorsal scales.

Released under the terms of the GPL, it is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X (Intel only). Luminance HDR supports several High Dynamic Range (HDR) as well as Low Dynamic Range (LDR) file formats.  Functionality  Prerequisite of HDR photography are several narrow-range digital images with different exposures. Luminance HDR combines these images and calculates a high-contrast image. In order to view this image on a regular computer monitor, Luminance HDR can convert it into a displayable LDR image format using a variety of methods, such as tone mapping. Currently fifteen different tone mapping operators (algorithms) are available, each one with its tunable parameters. Different image processing techniques can be applied to the generated HDR images, such as resizing, cropping, rotating and a number of projective transformations. The software also provides batch processing functionality for creating HDR images and for tone mapping them in a non-interactive way. A module for copying EXIF data among sets of images is also provided. For users who prefers the command line, a non-GUI, non-graphical interface is also available on all supported platforms. A common problem with HDR photography is that images need to be aligned exactly. If the subject is static, this can be achieved using a tripod or a stable surface on which the camera is placed. In the case of image data that does not align exactly, an automatic alignment can be performed using a tool provided by the Hugin project. If this automation doesn't provide the desired result, the user may improve it manually.

Parry is the founder and principal of Eric Parry Architects established in London in 1983. His built work includes the restoration and renewal of St Martin-in-the-Fields in London, the Holburne Museum in Bath, 50 New Bond Street, 23 Savile Row, One Eagle Place in Piccadilly, Aldermanbury Square by London Wall, 30 Finsbury Square in London, and the London Stock Exchange. His projects also include a number of residential developments. Eric Parry's architectural work and design has been shown internationally on major exhibitions, including the Royal Academy of Arts, the British School at Rome, and the 2012 Venice Biennale of Architecture. Personal life Holburne Museum, Bath, restoration and renewal, 2002‚Äì2011 Born in Kuwait City, Kuwait on 24 March 1952, to British parents Marion and Eric Parry, Parry's father was Chief Medical Officer in the Kuwaiti health service between 1948 and 1962. In his book Context: Architecture and the Genius of Place (2015), Parry alludes to his memories of growing up in Kuwait within sight of the nomadic life of Bedouin tribes. Later moving to Britain, Parry was educated at Shrewsbury School. From 1970, he attended Newcastle University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts' degree in Architecture in 1973. He later registered with the Royal College of Arts, where he obtained his Master of Arts in 1978. Parry completed his formal architectural education at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, where he was taught by Dalibor Vesely and Peter Carl, both of whom he would again later encounter while teaching in Cambridge. Parry obtained his Diploma in Architecture by the Architectural Association in 1980. He taught at the Cambridge Department of Architecture from 1983 to 1997, as a Lecturer in architecture. Parry was conferred an honorary Master of Arts by the University of Cambridge, and is a member of Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 2006, Parry was elected at the Royal Academy of Arts, and in 2012 received the degree of Doctor of Arts Honoris Causa from the University of Bath. Professional life Eric Parry began his professional life as a Lecturer at the Department of Architecture, University of Cambridge from 1983 to 1997. Since then he has taught at numerous universities, including the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University, the University of Houston and the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. He founded Eric Parry Architects in London in 1983. His early work included Artists' Studios in London for Antony Gormley and Tom Phillips, completed in 1988, as well as a private rehabilitation of the Ch√¢teau de Paulin in Tarn, France, which included the work of sculptor Stephen Cox. From this period dates also his masterplan for Pembroke College, Cambridge that was followed in 1993 by the project for the College's New Lodge and Student Accommodation. This was accompanied by a number of invited competition entries, namely for the extension of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (1993), and to rebuild St George's Hall, Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992. Interior of St Martin-in-the-Fields, 2002‚Äì2008 Parry's body of work also includes the corporate and commercial projects for W3 Stockley Park, completed in 1991, additional offices and conference rooms for the Royal Lancaster Hotel, London, and a complex of apartments for Damai Suria, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, completed in 1997. This work led to further commissions, such as the office buildings in London for 30 Finsbury Square, completed in 2002 as well as 23 Savile Row, 60 Threadneedle Street, 50 New Bond Street, all of which were completed in 2009. This involvement with the corporate world included the project for the new London Stock Exchange. At the same time, on the historical and educational fronts Parry developed a number of projects for schools, from the Bedford School Library and Music School to Wells Cathedral School Cedar's Hall completed in 2017. The cultural side to the practice is reflected in Parry's projects for London art galleries such as the Timothy Taylor Gallery in Dering Street and Carlos Place, as well as the restoration and renewal of St Martin-in-the-Fields, completed in 2008, and the Holburne Museum in Bath, Somerset. Parry's later work includes the residential building N10 for the East Village, London, formerly Olympic Village during the London 2012 Games. In 2013, Parry's completion of One Eagle Place, Piccadilly, was announced in the press, featuring a cornice by Turner Prize winner, artist Richard Deacon. The news was followed by Parry's completion of the neighbouring 8 St James's Square, a building that broke the UK office rent record.

The chronological position of Senusret IV is unclear and even the dynasty to which he belongs is debated.  Chronological position  According to J√ºrgen von Beckerath Senusret IV belonged to the late 13th Dynasty,J. von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der Zweiten Zwischenzeit in √Ñgypten, Gl√ºckstadt, 1964.J. von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen √Ñgyptens, M√ºnchner √Ñgyptologische Studien 46.

Ryholt: The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. 1800-1550 B.C, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications 20., Copenhagen, 1997, . Alternatively, Norbert Dautzenberg proposed that Senusret IV is part of the 17th Dynasty. Dautzenberg bases this hypothesis on his reading of entry 11.4 of the Turin canon as referring to Senusret IV. He also attributes graffiti on a gate of the Medamud temple mentioning a king \\"Senusret\\" to Senusret IV since the gate was decorated by Sobekemsaf I, who lived during the early 17th Dynasty.Norbert Dautzenberg: SeneferibRe Sesostris IV. ‚Äì ein K√∂nig der 17. Dynastie?, (G√∂ttinger Miszellen 129), G√∂ttingen 1992, p. 43‚Äì48 Both arguments are rejected by Ryholt: first, Ryholt notes that the Turin canon entry 11.4 is not compatible with Senusret IV's prenomen and second, he observes that the gate of the temple of Medamud was built by Senusret III so the graffiti is likely to refer to this king rather than Senusret IV. In the new arrangementOn Digital Egypt for Universities the dynasty of Senusret IV is left partially undetermined, being simply categorized as late 13th to early 17th.  Attestations  Senusret IV is attested on the Karnak king list under his prenomen \\"Senefer[...]re\\". The most important contemporary attestation of the king is a 2m 75 cm tall colossal statue of him, sculpted in pink granite and discovered in Karnak in 1901 by Georges Legrain.Statue Cairo CG 42026, description in G. Legrain, Annales du Service des Antiquit√©s de l‚ÄôEgypte 2 (1901), 272; and Legrain 1906, I, 15‚Äì16, pl.16. Other attestations include a block from El-Tod and the upper- right corner of a stela discovered in 1907 by Legrain in Karnak and which is inscribed with the date II Shemu 1 of the first regnal year of Senusret IV. Finally, a lintel from Edfu and an axe-blade bearing the nomen Senusret have also been attributed to Senusret IV based on stylistic considerations. In the case of the axe blade, however, some have attributed it to Senusret I.Axe- blade: Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology 16324, visible online here.

Written by Park Yeon-seon and directed by Kim Yong-soo, it aired as part of the Drama Special Series on KBS2 from January 30 to March 20, 2011 on Sundays at 23:15 for 8 episodes. A series of deaths, including murder and suicide, take place over eight days in a private, elite high school deep in the mountains, with the students cut off from the outside world and in highly volatile and unstable emotional conditions. The drama deals with the question of whether evil is organic or environmental, and the potential for adolescents to be extremely empathetic as well as equally cruel. Plot Deep in the mountains of Gangwon, the private, elite Soo-sin High School is attended by the top 1% of students in the country. Their stellar marks are the result of constant pressure and a strict punishment system, to the point where students avoid any activities outside of studying. It is in this atmosphere that seven students and a teacher remain at school for the winter break, joined by Kim Yo-han (Kim Sang-kyung), a psychiatrist who was forced to take shelter with them after he was injured in a car accident nearby. Stranded from heavy snow, they spend eight days together ‚Äï from Christmas Eve to New Year's Day. Park Mu-yeol (Baek Sung-hyun) is an honor student who chooses to remain in school during the winter break after receiving an abusive letter. Jo Young-jae (Kim Young-kwang) is a detested bully who attacks other people to hide his inferiority complex. Yoon Soo (Lee Soo-hyuk) is a disturbed, but rich student fronting a rock band.

It had a unique variant of the Dreadnaught Wheel design. Alternating bearing plates gave support to each wheel, allowing it to travel over soft ground without bogging down. This was an early attempt to solve the problem that was later addressed more effectively by the caterpillar track. After running into financial difficulty, Bottrill spent the later part of his working life clearing bush and hauling loads in the west of New South Wales and Victoria. Big Lizzie has been preserved, and stands in a small park in Red Cliffs, Victoria. Early years Frank Bottrill was born on 1 April 1871 into a Methodist family in Sturt, Adelaide. His father, John Lucas Bottrill, was a market gardener. His mother was Eliza Bottrill, n√©e Macklin. He apprenticed as a blacksmith, and worked in the Moonta and Wallaroo mines in South Australia, qualifying as a steam engine driver. He moved to Broken Hill, New South Wales, around 1889. In an early venture, Bottrill formed a steam-engine company to transport supplies to Broken Hill and set out from Adelaide with his first vehicle. The engine became bogged down in the sand north of Morgan, to the north of the Murray River, and had to be abandoned. By 1896 Bottrill had returned to East Payneham in Adelaide and was working there as a blacksmith. He submitted a patent application in September 1896 for improvements to the design of windmills. Frank Botrill and his brother Reuben were hired to clear bush in Tintinara, South Australia, in the early 1900s. Engineer and inventor Illustration from Bottrill's 1912 patent filing in the United Kingdom In 1846 James Boydell had obtained a patent in Britain for a steam traction engine with \\"Dreadnaught Wheels\\", where each wheel had hinged plates attached loosely at regular intervals around the outside of the rim. Each plate in turn would lie flat on the ground as the wheel rolled over it, providing better support in muddy or sandy ground. Bottrill heard of Boydell's system, and in 1906 filed a patent for an improved design. He used crossed wire ropes to attach the \\"bearer\\" shoes to the wheel rims. The plates alternated on each side of the rim, which was split, to give a smoother ride. Bottrill's \\"Dreadnaught\\" or \\"Ped-rail\\" patent was approved on 6 September 1907. He installed his dreadnaught wheels on two McLaren steam traction engines between 1906 and 1910. \\"Big Lizzie\\" on 14 August 2009 at Red Cliffs, Victoria, Australia Bottrill moved to Victoria in 1908, and joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Ballarat. On 31 March 1909 he married Margaret Young, a bible worker with the church. Botrill moved to South Melbourne, where he collaborated with the A. H. McDonald company as an engineer as well as a blacksmith. The Mount Gunson copper mines in South Australia bought the first set of Dreadnaught wheels on a tractor built by Austral Otis with a forty-horsepower twin-cylinder McDonald engine. It was tested in swampy land near the Austral Otis works in August 1911, then dismantled and shipped to Hummock Hill (now Whyalla), where Frank and Reuben Bottril re-assembled the tractor and drove it to Port Augusta, South Australia. For a while Bottril's pedrails were offered as an optional feature by McDonald's on their farm and industrial tractors. They were used on tractors in Cloncurry, Queensland, mines. In 1913 McDonald's won contracts to build two tractors with pedrails for Commonwealth Railways, who were building a section of the Trans-Australian Railway across the Nullarbor desert. Reuben Bottril brought the tractors into operation. He wrote to his brother, Botrill's patented wheels were also used on \\"Big Lizzie\\", a huge traction engine which McDonald's built to his design in 1915. Big Lizzie could carry almost 90 tons when two trailers were attached. There were just six bearers on each wheel, compared to Bottril's earlier designs which had as many as twelve bearers. This placed more strain on the cables retaining the bearers, and had the effect of reducing the tractor's speed to one mile per hour. Big Lizzie was awkward to manoeuvre, with a turning radius of . Later years \\"Big Lizzie\\" in 2006 Bottrill planned to drive Big Lizzie to the Broken Hill mines, with two pedrail-equipped wagons in tow. He left Melbourne early in 1916, taking his family with him. He travelled at a maximum speed of 1 mph, going off road where bridges were not strong enough or the road bends were too sharp. The tractor broke through a bridge near Kilmore. The Campaspe River was flooded, and it took three weeks to remove snags and build earthworks before a crossing was possible near Elmore. The Murray River could not be crossed at Echuca as planned since the river was flooded and Bottrill was not allowed to take the tractor into the town over the approach bridge. Bottrill reached Kerang in January 1917, where he spent five months working on improvements. He reached Ouyen in August 1917 and Mildura in October 1917. After a journey of 21 months, he found that the Murray was flooded and impassable. Urgently needing work, Bottrill began taking on contracts to haul wheat and clear bush in the area. He was to continue with this work for the rest of his working life. From 1920 to 1924 Bottrill worked in Red Cliffs, in the Rural City of Mildura, clearing the ground for a irrigated farming settlement for World War I veterans. Up to 16 men helped attach cables to trees and stumps which Big Lizzie then hauled out. After this job was over, Bottrill drove Big Lizzie to Western Victoria to continue clearing land. He lived near Balmoral, Victoria, from 1926 to 1931, and from 1926 to 1928 cleared land at the nearby Glendinning station. However, disputes arose with the station owners, one being due to the fact that Bottril would not work on Saturday, considered to be the Sabbath by his church. He sold out in 1928, reluctantly abandoning Big Lizzie. Botrill lived in Lismore near Camperdown, Victoria from 1931 to 1934, then moved to Dareton, New South Wales, near Mildura, where he was an elder of the church and the treasurer for the rest of his life. He died on 7 January 1953 at Mildura. Despite all the frustrations, Bottrill was never known to drink, swear or lose his temper. Big Lizzie stood idle for many years. The Blackstone engine was sold in 1938, powered stone crushing equipment at Pyramid Hill until 1942 and was scrapped in 1945. Big Lizzie was recovered and brought to Red Cliffs in 1971. She is now displayed in Barclay Square on the Calder highway. Visitors may listen to a recording that tells the history of the machine.

Listed at 5' 11\\", 185 lb., he batted and threw left handed.Figueredo, Jorge S. (2003). Who's Who in Cuban Baseball, 1878‚Äì1961. McFarland and Company. Early life Born in Sag√ºa la Grande, Villa Clara Province, Mayor enjoyed a distinguished pitching career between 1938 and 1953. Even though he never reached the major league level, Mayor won more than 250 games while pitching in Cuban professional baseball, the Mexican League and Minor League Baseball, being also highly competitive while representing Cuba in international tournaments. Mayor was raised and grew up in Caibari√©n, another municipality of Villa Clara, where he started to play baseball at the school at age 12. Originally, he began playing at first base but was quickly turned into a pitcher by the school's coach. (Spanish) Following his graduation in 1933, he moved to Havana in search of better working conditions and remuneration. After that he focused in baseball and pitched for several industrial teams sponsored by companies, which included the Central Algodones, Deportivo C√°rdenas and Central Hershey of the Cuban National Amateur Baseball League. In 1937, he led the circuit with a 1.13 earned run average and also pitched in an exhibition game against the New York Giants when they visited Cuba during their spring training.Jamail, Milton. (2000). Full Count: Inside Cuban Baseball. Southern Illinois University Press. Video footage of the New York Giants in Cuba for spring training in 1937 He later joined the Fortuna BBC and represented Cuba in the 1938 Central American and Caribbean Games held at Panama City. Mayor was almost the whole story in the baseball competition, either starting or relieving, picking up four of Cuba's five victories in their Gold medal tournament, a feat not duplicated by any pitcher before or since in this long standing event.Bjarkman, Peter C. (2007). A History of Cuban Baseball, 1864‚Äì2006. McFarland and Company Cuban Baseball: A Statistical History Cuban league career Mayor came back triumphantly to Cuba and then signed professionally with the Alacranes de Almendares. He debuted in the 1938‚Äì39 season and played for them through 1953. He emerged in 1941-42, going 6-2 with a 1.55 ERA in 15 pitching appearances, tying with Max Macon for the best winning percentage (.750). His most productive season came in 1946-47, when he posted a 10-4 record and a 2.26 ERA in 28 games, including career-highs in wins and starts (nine).Who's Who in Cuban Baseball The Cuban left-handed formed part of many memorable moments in the history of Almendares, although two of them stand out above the rest. The first was in the 1946-47 season, when the Alacranes came back and swept their eternal rivals Leones de la Habana to win the championship, while the other was when the team represented Cuba in the inaugural Caribbean Series played in Havana in 1949. The 1946‚Äì47 season represented the most significant pennant race in Cuban League history. During the last month of the season Almendares began making up a 6¬Ω games deficit to Habana. The Alacranes won 10 of their next 11 games, while Mayor earned four of these wins. On February 23, 1947 Habana had a 1¬Ω game lead over Almendares with a three-game series remaining against them. Almendares would need to win all three to win the league's title. Then, their pitching star Max Lanier defeated the Leones, 4‚Äì2, in the first game. The next day, Mayor won a four-hit complete-game pitching duel against Fred Martin and the Leones by a score of 2‚Äì1, being highlighted by Andr√©s Fleitas, who tripled the winning run in the 7th inning to obtain the narrow victory. In decisive Game 3, Lanier returned on only one day of rest to beat Habana 9‚Äì2, and Almendares completed the feat. Mayor and Lanier were born on the same day (August 18, 1915).Juan F. P√©rez website ‚Äì Agapito Mayor entry (Spanish) After that, Almendares won easily the 1948-49 title. As the league champions, the team represented Cuba in the Caribbean Series. Then, once again, Mayor made history in an international competition. He went 3-0, equaling the total of wins of any other club, while leading his team to the Series title. On February 21, 1949, he started and defeated Puerto Rico's Indios de Mayag√ºez. Three days later he faced again Mayag√ºez, handling a long relief role and was credited with the win. The next day he relieved against Panama's Spur Cola and earned his third win. Overall, he allowed four earned runs on 11 hits and two walks, while striking out nine in 10‚Öî innings of work. He earned Caribbean Series MVP honors, while his three wins in the tournament is a pitching record that has not been matched since. Mayor thus established a mark of three Series victories that would still 11 seasons, when Camilo Pascual collected his 3rd and 4th wins in the 1959 Series.Nu√±ez, Jos√© Antero (1994). Serie del Caribe de la Habana a Puerto La Cruz. JAN Editor. La Primera Serie del Caribe ‚Äì 1949 (Spanish) Mayor only missed one season with Almendares (1947‚Äì48). In a 15-season career, he posted a 68-64 record with 314 strikeouts and a 3.27 ERA in 308 games, including 53 complete games and 972 innings pitched. He ranked 2nd for the most games and innings pitched in the Cuban League all-time list, 5th in losses, tied for 6th in seasons pitched, and 10th for most games won. Minor league career Dating back to 1940, the Washington Senators showed interest in Mayor and signed him a contract. He split the season with Class B Springfield and Class A Greenville, sporting a collective 16-9 record and a 2.80 ERA, ending second in the South Atlantic League in ERA (2.37) behind Lefty Guise (2.06) while surpassing Fred Martin (2.53).1940 South Atlantic League pitching leaders He went 15-13 with a 3.89 ERA for Greenville the next year,1941 South Atlantic League pitching leaders leading his team in wins and innings pitched (229.0). Mexican league career After playing two seasons in the Senators system, Mayor was well on the path to the major leagues before a higher salary offer from Jorge Pasquel lured him to the Mexican League. He pitched from 1942 through 1948 with six different teams of the league, most prominently with the Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo. Mayor registered an 8-7 record and a 3.89 ERA in 1942, going 16-15 with a 3.91 ERA in 1943, while declining slightly to 14-13 and 4.62 in 1944. These records were posted during his interminable journey with five clubs, but he improved considerably after joining Nuevo Laredo. In 1945 he boosted his record to 23-14 with a 3.45 ERA with the Tecolotes, while leading the circuit in wins. At the end of the season he was named pitcher of the year.Treto Cisneros, Pedro (2002). The Mexican League/La Liga Mexicana: Comprehensive Player Statistics, 1937‚Äì2001. McFarland & Company. He was especially sharp in the 1946 season, going 20-9 with a 3.45 ERA and 157 strikeouts, including six shutouts, while the rest of Nuevo Laredo's pitchers combined for a paltry 28-41 record. In addition, Mayor led the league in shutouts and complete games (23), tied Sal Maglie for the most wins, and finished second in strikeouts behind Booker McDaniels. For the second consecutive season, he gained pitcher of the year honors. Mayor played one more season in Mexico before rejoining the Senators organization briefly in 1948. He returned to the Mexican League during the middle of the year, pitching for two teams during that span. He then played again in the minors from 1949 to 1952 and returned to the Mexican circuit in 1954, his last year as a ballplayer. Career statistics During his minor league career, Mayor pitched in parts or all of seven seasons spanning 1940‚Äì1952, sporting an 87-68 record and a 3.45 ERA in 214 pitching appearances. In an eight-year career in Mexico (1942‚Äì1948, 1954), he posted a 98-76 record and a 3.79 ERA. Overall, including his 68-64 and 3.27 ERA in the Cuban winter league from 1938‚Äì1953, he amassed a career record of 253-208 with a 3.50 ERA in 17 years, averaging more than 250 innings pitched in each of those years. Final years He later coached for Almendares in the 1953‚Äì54 and 1954-55 seasons. In 1970 he gained induction into the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame (Phase 2). Following his retirement, Mayor was a long time resident of Tampa, Florida, where he died in 2005 at the age of 89, after dealing with Alzheimer's disease for many years.Cuba Encuentro Deportes ‚Äì Falleci√≥ en Tampa el pitcher cubano Agapito Mayor Valenzuela (Spanish) Sources Category:1915 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Alijadores de Tampico players Category:Almendares (baseball) players Category:Azules de Veracruz players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Cuban baseball players Category:Cuban expatriates in the United States Category:Diablos Rojos del M√©xico players Category:Greenville Majors players Category:Greenville Spinners players Category:Hartford Bees players Category:Havana Cubans players Category:Laredo Apaches players Category:Pericos de Puebla players Category:Rojos del √Åguila de Veracruz players Category:Sherman‚ÄìDenison Twins players Category:Shreveport Sports players Category:Springfield Nationals players Category:Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo players Category:Temple Eagles players Category:Texarkana Bears players Category:Tuneros de San Luis Potos√≠ players ","title":"Agapito Mayor"},{"id":"39368197","text":"The Most Illustrious Order of Queen Salote Tupou III is a knighthood order of the Kingdom of Tonga.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Diaz teamed up with Joshua Ilika Brenner, Alejandro Siqueiros, and Leonardo Salinas Saldana in the men's 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay. Swimming the third leg, Diaz recorded a split of 1:53.34, and the Mexicans rounded out an eight-team field to last place and fifteenth overall in a new national record of 7:29.54. Shortly after his second Olympics, Diaz retired from swimming to work as a sports analyst for Televisa Deportes Network. He also became a network's swimming commentator for the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, and eventually, for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

Sears and starring Dan Duryea, Frances Gifford and Mike Connors (credited as \\"Touch Conners\\"). The Cold War period provides the background, although the plot concerns a flashback to World War II aerial action. Sky Commando was the last major film feature for Frances Gifford as her postwar career was affected by serious personal problems. The film was one of Connors' first, having made his debut in Sudden Fear (1952); he had previously appeared in Sears' The 49th Man, earlier in 1953. Plot During the Korean War, while American Air Force pilots Lt. John Willard (William Bryant) and his brother Frank (Dick Paxton) are flying a routine reconnaissance mission, their commanding officer, Col. Ed Wyatt (Dan Duryea) orders them to bomb an enemy position. Frank's aircraft is shot down, and John returns to confront his commander over the reason for the dangerous mission. Wyatt's executive officer, Maj. Scott (Michael Fox) stops him and relates a story about Wyatt's career during World War II. In the 8th Air Force, Wyatt commanded a bomber group whose reconnaissance missions provided valuable information for future bombing raids. War correspondent Jo McWethy (Frances Gifford) who was assigned to cover Wyatt's group, wanted to know the truth about his reputation for being a hard-driving and unsympathetic commanding officer. His pilots held Wyatt responsible for the death of his co-pilot during a dangerous mission and new co-pilot, Lt. Hobson \\"Hobbie\\" Lee (Mike Connors), becomes the replacement. During a \\"milk-run\\", Wyatt changed the mission to photograph heavily defended Bremen. German anti-aircraft batteries shot down several fighter escorts and badly damaged Wyatt's aircraft, killing three of his crew. Nursing the stricken bomber back home, Wyatt made the decision to dump everything to save the aircraft and its important film. Hobbie and waist-gunner Danny Nelson (Freeman Morse) had to ditch the bodies of the dead crew and parachute out. Wyatt then flew back with the injured navigator aboard. During his recuperation, Hobbie met Jo who was also unsure about Wyatt's decisions and when Hobbie followed Wyatt to North Africa, he was seeking confirmation that his commander was a ruthless martinet. During a dangerous mission over Romanian oil fields, Wyatt's bomber was shot down. Although five of the crew were saved, gunner Danny Nelson was killed. With the aid of partisans, Hobbie reconciled with the badly wounded Wyatt, and managed to convey the crucial roll of film safely back to England. When Scott concludes his story, Lt. Willard realizes that Wyatt does care for his men. A wire the next day informs him that his brother is still alive and has been rescued.

Combs A predominance of stock footage was used in Sky Commando. Production Sky Commando was a typical Fred F. Sears actioner, combining an array of stock footage with live action. As one of the many features that Sears helmed in a very short period, the film was a \\"B\\" feature, although it did star Duryea, Gifford and future TV star Mike Connors. With principal photography done over an eight-day span, March 16‚Äì23, 1953, most of the production work that remained involved merging the stock combat footage of USAF and USAAF action. The preponderance of stock footage was not always carefully integrated; Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, North American B-25 Mitchell, North American F-86 Sabre and Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star footage was, at times, jarringly spliced together, with a view of a bomber changing dramatically to a different aircraft. Most of the action in the cockpit between Conners and Duryea was filmed in a B-25 bomber cockpit.\\"Original Print Information: Sky Commando.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: 12 May 2013.

Kichhauchhwi is a patron of various social, academic and other developmental activities of Sufi Sunni Muslims in India. He is the Founder and National President of the All India Ulema and Mashaikh Board (AIUMB), a Sufi movement in India. AIUMB Kichhouchhwi, as leader of the AIUMB, has gathered Sufi clerics (Ulama and Mashaikh) and other Muslim leaders in India to build up community resilience against terrorism. Kichhowchhwi led a Sufi delegation that met the Indian PM on August 26, 2015 to raise the concerns of growing extremism in the name of Islam. The delegation members said the spread of terrorism in the name of Islam represents a danger to peace all over the world, and there is urgent need to take action to marginalise the forces which are promoting extremism for social, economic or political considerations. He has said that there is need to spread awareness among the Muslim community that organisations such as the ISIS and al Qaeda do not represent the path of Islam. He gave several suggestions for the promotion of Sufi thought and culture in India, including creation of a \\"Sufi circuit\\" to promote tourism, and steps for the rejuvenation of Sufi shrines and sites in India. Kichhouchhwi opines that ‚ÄúIslam has been conflated in media with extremism... We have to keep the Muslim youths away from the politically motivated ‚ÄòIslamists‚Äô and recognize the real culprits who cause greater defamation of Islam and Muhammad than the Islamophobes.‚Äù In recent years, Kichhouchhwi has organized large-scale conferences, popularly known as ‚ÄúMuslim Maha Panchayats‚Äù, in addition to small gatherings, in many parts of India. In these gatherings, Sufis have declared that they accept neither the religious nor the political leadership of the Wahhabis. The AIUMB plans to organize an international Sufi conference or Religious Leaders‚Äô Summit in the beginning of 2016. AIUMB protest against Zakir Naik As a result of Kichhouchhwi's efforts, opposing Muslim preachers and televangelists including Zakir Naik faced protests from the All India Ulama & Mashaikh Board. Naik, who is President of the Mumbai-based Islamic Research Foundation and a frequent public speaker in Muslim countries, organized a public lecture on January 17, 2015 at the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC), New Delhi. A large number of Muslims, both Sunnis and Shias, led by All India Ulama & Mashaikh Board, gathered outside the premises of the IICC, strongly protesting against his address at the venue. They held that Naik had not only hurt the sentiments of Shia and Sufi Muslims and non- Muslims, but had also desecrated the values of religious harmony and respect for all faiths. Therefore, they did not think it appropriate for Naik to be a guest-speaker at the IICC, which is meant to stand for communal harmony and amity amongst the people of India. Foreign visits and lectures In his visit to the First Asia & Pacific Countries Muslim Religious Leaders' Summit organized by the Presidency of Religious Affairs of Turkey (Dƒ∞B), Kichhouchhwi stated that at a time when the extremism has penetrated the Asia-pacific countries in different forms, Sufi Ulama, Mashaikh, Imams and muftis, need to oppose the menace of Islamist radicalism and religious extremism. He also stated in his address: \\"at a time when the extremism has penetrated the Asia- pacific countries in different forms, Sufi Ulama, Mashaikh, Imams and muftis from Morocco to India to Bosnia to Chechnya to Pakistan to UAE to wartorn Syria ‚Äìincluding Shia community, have come out to tackle the onslaught of religious extremism... So far, Sufi Islamic scholars and clerics and their organisations have held back the tide of extremism and radicalism.\\" Kichhouchhwi strongly condemned all groups who are perpetrating terrorist acts in the name of Islam. ‚ÄúTerror is terror, it has no relation to any religion, and it is a grave threat to all humanity,‚Äù he said. He also condemned the last terror act in Turkey. ‚ÄúNo matter which religion it comes from, we condemn such terror incidents, he said. He hoped that the summit would help rebuild deep cultural and historical relations and values between Muslim countries. Stance against ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Taliban and other extremist outfits Against the backdrop of a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris On the evening of 13 November 2015, Kichhouchhwi stated: ‚Äúthe Paris attack is not just an aggression against the people of France, but this is an infringement against the universal values of Islam. It was Islam which set example centuries ago by sheltering the Spanish Jews when Spain threw them out. It was Islam which taught Muslims to be the most compassionate towards the strangers and the guests, both Muslims and non-Muslims alike. But the ISIS aims at completely run down the history of Islam which is replete with these universal and egalitarian values.‚Äù Syed Muhammad Ashraf also denounced al-Qaeda‚Äôs plan to form Qaiadat ul Jihad in South Asia.

It is one of the Coal Region's biggest discharges of mine water. The tunnel is five miles (eight kilometers) long and was constructed between 1891 and 1894, and at the time of its construction, was reputed to be the largest mine drainage tunnel in the world. It consists of major tunnels A and B, and minor tunnels C, D and X. Description The Jeddo Tunnel drains four large coal basins over an area of close to . It also drained the collieries of G.B. Markle & Company. On average the tunnel drains of water each minute. Sometimes the tunnel drains up to 100,000 gallons per minute.. The tunnel is about 5 miles (8 kilometers) long and runs between Black Creek and the hills in Butler Valley. It is . The Jeddo Tunnel is located close to the community of Drums. The tunnel drains the nine major minepools in the area via gravity. The Jeddo Tunnel drains the mines in 13 nearby communities. These communities are Hollywood, Lattimer, Minesville, Drifton, Harleigh, Sandy Run, Ebervale, Humboldt, Cranberry, Harwood, Stockton, and the Eckley Miners' Village. Hydrology The level of precipitation in the watershed of the Jeddo Tunnel between 1996 and 1998 was per year. The average level of surface runoff during the same period was . The base runoff was inches and the evapotranspiration was inches. The Jeddo Tunnel is the largest carrier of water away from the Jeddo Tunnel watershed. There are several streams on the surface, such as Black Creek, Little Black Creek, Hazle Creek, and Cranberry Creek. Besides minepools, contributors to the flow of the tunnel include precipitation draining through mines, seepage of streams, and water falling through sinkholes and cave-ins. 39% of the Jeddo Tunnel's discharge, or per second, comes from the Black Creek watershed. 26%, or per second comes from the Cranberry Creek watershed. 21%, or per second, comes from the Hazle Creek watershd. 14%, or per second, comes from the Little Black Creek watershed. The tunnel's discharge is lowest in November. The specific conductance of the water in the Jeddo Tunnel is on average around 728 micromohs. Water quality More than of acid drain from the Jeddo Tunnel into the Susquehanna River (via Little Nescopeck and Nescopeck Creeks) every day. At the end of the 1990s, the sulfate, iron, manganese, and aluminum levels in the Jeddo Tunnel were significantly lower than in previous years. The pH of the tunnel water has also risen significantly. The pH of the water in the Jeddo Tunnel ranges between approximately 3.6 and 5.0, and averages around 4.3. The tunnel water's pH level is the lowest at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. The most commonly occurring cation in the water of the tunnel is magnesium, which occurs in concentrations of 52 mg/l. Calcium is another cation that occurs in the tunnel water, at concentrations of 35 mg/l. Sodium and potassium also occur in the water from the Jeddo Tunnel, at concentrations of 12 and 2.2 mg/l, respectively. There are also several other metals in the tunnel's water. The iron concentration ranges from 2 to 90 mg/l and averages at 9 mg/l. The manganese concentration ranges from 1.4 to 6.8 mg/l and averages at 4.2 mg/l. The aluminum concentration ranges from 2.5 to 44 mg/l. The zinc concentration in the tunnel water averages at 0.7 mg/l. The iron, aluminum, and manganese concentrations are all several times higher than the ideal concentration. Common anions in the tunnel's water include sulfate and chloride. These occur at concentrations of 284 and 13.5 mg/l, respectively. The concentration of solids in the water of the Jeddo Tunnel ranges between 265 and 6800 mg/l. The average concentration is 900 mg/l. The solids consist of 125 milligrams per liter of suspended solids and 140 to 6675 mg/l of dissolved solids. The concentration of solids in the water has been decreasing since at least the 1990s. An average of of aluminum, of manganese, and of iron per day flow through the Jeddo Tunnel.. History The original builders of the Jeddo Tunnel suspected that the local farmers, who used Little Nescopeck Creek as their water supply, would not approve of mine waters from the tunnel polluting the creek. Because of this, the lawyer Thomas McNair bought the right of way along the creek. The basic geology of the Jeddo Tunnel's watershed was created 345 million years ago, during the Carboniferous Period. The Jeddo Tunnel itself was established at the end of the 19th century. John Markle was one of the people involved in designing the tunnel; he spent three years and $1,000,000 on the construction of the tunnel. Two teams of workers used compressed air drills and explosives to build the tunnel from both ends. A total of 250 workers were involved in the construction of the tunnel. The construction finished on September 15, 1894. The construction of the Jeddo Tunnel used up 170 tons of forcite, a Belgian gel dynamite.. The Jeddo Tunnel's original purpose was to remove the water from deep coal mines in the eastern middle anthracite field. However it also connects to mining operations near Hazleton. The construction of the tunnel involved the channeling of streams, as well as the construction of haulageways. When constructed, the tunnel was considered to be an engineering marvel; however, in modern times, Alan C. Gregory describes it as \\"a dinosaur that survived extinction\\". The tunnel ceased to be used in 1955, when the deep-mining industry stopped, and the mines in the area were largely abandoned in 1961. However Pagnotti Enterprises still mines anthracite in the vicinity of the tunnel. The water quality of the Jeddo Tunnel has improved slightly since the deep-mining industry stopped. The Jeddo Tunnel has been the subject of a number of studies. Between 1949 and 1950, group led by a person named Ash gathered data on the tunnel's water quality and discharge. The Hazleton City Authority conducted a study at the beginning of the 1970s, attempting to determine if the tunnel's outflow was of suitable quality for drinking water. The United States Geological Survey monitored the tunnel's water quality and flow in 1975 and again in 1991. The Wildlife Conservancy, Bloomsburg University, and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission all studied the Jeddo Tunnel between 1995 and 1998. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory once conducted a study to determine whether it would be worthwhile to install a hydroelectric system in the Jeddo Tunnel. Several studies have attempted to fix the pollution coming from the tunnel but their proposed plans cost at least $15,000,000 and take at least 20 years. Construction of additional tunnels The main tunnels of the Jeddo Tunnel A and B were built in 1895. In later years, several more tunnels were added to the system, increasing its length to close to . Jeddo Tunnel A goes from Ebervale Mammoth Vain slope number 2 to Little Nescopeck Creek and is long. Jeddo Tunnel B goes from Jeddo Mammoth Vain slope number 9 to the beginning of Jeddo Tunnel A, a distance of feet. Jeddo Tunnel C was created in 1926. It stretched from the Highland Number 5 mine to the beginning of Jeddo Tunnel B for a distance of . Jeddo Tunnel D was created in 1929. It stretched from Drifton Number 2 mine to the beginning of Jeddo Tunnel C for a distance of . The final addition to the Jeddo Tunnel was Jeddo Tunnel X, which was constructed in 1934. It started at the Hazleton Shaft Colliery and was long. It joins the main tunnel system at the confluence of Jeddo Tunnels A and B. Environmental impact, media impact and controversies The Jeddo Tunnel was initially received positively. The Philadelphia Press and the New York Herald both printed a piece on the tunnel on December 9, 1894, calling the tunnel a \\"remarkable feat of engineering\\". The water that the Jeddo Tunnel drains is polluted due to past mining in its vicinity. The Jeddo Tunnel drains into Little Nescopeck Creek, thus polluting the creek and consequently Nescopeck Creek, the Susquehanna River, and the Chesapeake Bay. The construction of the tunnel has partially contributed to the width of Little Nescopeck Creek increasing from around 10 feet to between 30 and 40 feet. The tunnel is the only source of acid mine drainage that flows into Little Nescopeck Creek. The Jeddo Tunnel has eroded the banks of Little Nescopeck Creek. One contaminant in the Jeddo Tunnel is aluminum. The tunnel also discharges coal dust and sediment containing heavy metals. These materials collect along the banks of Little Nescopeck Creek. Two people were killed in the Jeddo Tunnel on February 5, 1894. The tunnel also takes in sewage, hydrocarbons, and runoff pollution. Reducing tunnel discharge  Several proposed measures have been introduced to reduce the discharge of the Jeddo Tunnel. One of these methods is to seal fissures, cave-ins, and sinkholes in the Jeddo Tunnel watershed. This could reduce the Jeddo Tunnel's discharge by 11%. Diverting runoff from the hills around the coal basins near the Jeddo Tunnel is another method of reducing the tunnel's discharge, and this could reduce the discharge by 10%. Creating perimeter drains to pick up runoff from nearby ridges is another proposed method of reducing the tunnel's discharge.

Plastic films and coated papers are sometimes used as inner layers to provide a moisture barrier, and resistance to rodents and insects. Usually consists of several layers to provide strength, with high elasticity and high tear resistance, designed for packaging products with high demands for strength and durability and resistant outer surface where instructions are printed, trademark, etc. Paper sack are produced on paper sack machine consisting of tuber and a bottomer.Industrial Bags Production, Mondi Group Sack Paper manufacturing Wood pulp for sack paper is made from softwood by the kraft process. The long fibers provides the paper its strength and is added wet strength chemicals to even further improve the strength. Both white and brown grades are made. Sack paper is then produced on a paper machine from the wood pulp. The paper is microcrepped to give porosity and elasticity. Microcrepping is done by drying with loose draws allowing it to shrink. This is causing the paper to elongate 4% in machine direction and 10% in cross direction before busting. Machine direction elongation can be further improved by pressing between very elastic cylinders causing more microcrepping. The paper may be coated with polyethylene (PE) to ensure an effective barrier against moisture, grease and bacteria. A paper sack can be made of several layers of sack paper depending on the toughness needed. Properties Paper sacks are usually made of Kraft paper having the advantage of being soft and strong at the same time. The stretch or elongation increases the energy required to break the material. They easily carry and protect products up to 50 kg, and adapt easily to the nature of their contents and to handling constraints. At the same time sacks are provide an excellent media for promotional messages and sophisticated printing designs. Paper sacks capacity is variable, each country sets a maximum ground rules such as job security, it comes in a variety of calipers, basis weights, and treatments. Testing Filled bags or sacks can be evaluated in the field by careful observation. Laboratory package testing is often conducted using drop testing , shock table testing , puncture testing, etc. Applications Plastic hazard free paper sacks also called multiwall paper sacks are used for cement, food, chemicals, consumer goods, flour bags etc. References * Yam, K.

The polity was established in the 1870s on territory carved out of the ruling Majeerteen Sultanate (Migiurtinia).Helen Chapin Metz, Somalia: a country study, (The Division: 1993), p.10. Ali Yusuf's brother, Osman Yusuf Kenadid, would go on to invent the Osmanya writing script for the Somali language. In an attempt to advance his own expansionist objectives, Kenadid p√®re in late 1888 entered into a treaty with the Italians, making his realm an Italian protectorate.The Majeerteen Sultanates The terms of the agreement specified that Italy was to steer clear of any interference in the sultanate's administration. However, the relationship between Hobyo and Italy soured when the elder Kenadid refused the Italians' proposal to allow a British contingent of troops to disembark in his Sultanate so that they might then pursue their battle against the Somali religious and nationalist leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's Dervish forces. Viewed as too much of a threat by the Italians, Sultan Kenadid was eventually exiled to Aden in Yemen and then to Eritrea, as was his son Ali Yusuf, the heir apparent to his throne.

It is composed for soprano or tenor soloist and string orchestra, and sets verse and prose poems written in 1872‚Äì1873 by Arthur Rimbaud, part of his collection Les Illuminations. History Britten began writing the cycle in Suffolk in March 1939 and completed it a few months later in the United States. It was the first of his song cycles to gain widespread popularity. The cycle was originally written for a soprano; Britten's biographer David Matthews comments that the work is \\"so much more sensuous when sung by the soprano voice for which the songs were conceived\\".Matthews, p. 56 Nevertheless the work can be, and more often is, sung by a tenor: Britten conducted the piece with Peter Pears as soloist within two years of the premiere. Pears was the dedicatee of the song \\"Being Beauteous\\". Wulff Scherchen was the dedicatee of the song \\"Antique\\". Both men were in romantic relationships with Britten. The first performance of the cycle was given on 30 January 1940 at the Aeolian Hall, London, by Sophie Wyss, to whom the cycle is dedicated. (There are also dedications for individual sections.) Boyd Neel conducted his string orchestra.\\"Music in London: Les Illuminations A Remarkable Work\\", The Observer, 4 February 1940, p. 11 Structure The work takes about 21 minutes in performance. The nine sections are: * 1. Fanfare * 2. Villes * 3a and 3b. Phrase and Antique * 4. Royaut√© * 5. Marine * 6. Interlude * 7. Being beauteous * 8. Parade * 9. D√©part The work begins with a single sentence (taken from the poem \\"Parade\\") \\"\\" (\\"I alone have the key to this savage parade\\"). Seemingly, Britten takes this to mean that only the artist, observing the world with detachment, can make sense of the \\"savage parade\\" that is human life. The sentence is sung three times during the cycle.Program Notes , Chamber Orchestra of Boston, accessed 12 May 2013. 1\\\\. Fanfare J'ai seul la clef de cette parade sauvage. 2\\\\. Villes Ce sont des villes! C'est un peuple pour qui se sont mont√©s ces Alleghanys et ces Libans de r√™ve! Des chalets de cristal et de bois se meuvent sur des rails et des poulies invisibles. Les vieux crat√®res ceints de colosses et de palmiers de cuivre rugissent m√©lodieusement dans les feux‚Ä¶Des cort√®ges de Mabs en robes rousses, opalines, montent des ravines. L√†-haut, les pieds dans la cascade et les ronces, les cerfs tettent Diane. Les Bacchantes des banlieues sanglotent et la lune br√ªle et hurle. V√©nus entre dans les cavernes des forgerons et des ermites. Des groupes de beffrois chantent les id√©es des peuples. Des ch√¢teaux b√¢tis en os sort la musique inconnue‚Ä¶Le paradis des orages s'effondre‚Ä¶Les sauvages dansent sans cesse la f√™te de la nuit‚Ä¶ Quels bons bras, quelle belle heure me rendront cette r√©gion d'o√π viennent mes sommeils et mes moindres mouvements? 3a.

Autour de ton front couronn√© de fleurettes et de baies, tes yeux, des boules pr√©cieuses, remuent. Tach√©es de lies brunes, tes joues se creusent. Tes crocs luisent. Ta poitrine ressemble √† une cithare, des tintements circulent dans tes bras blonds. Ton c≈ìur bat dans ce ventre o√π dort le double sexe. Prom√®ne-toi, la nuit, en mouvant doucement cette cuisse, cette seconde cuisse et cette jambe de gauche. 4\\\\. Royaut√© Un beau matin, chez un peuple fort doux, un homme et une femme superbes criaient sur la place publique: \\"Mes amis, je veux qu'elle soit reine!\\" \\"Je veux √™tre reine!\\" Elle riait et tremblait. Il parlait aux amis de r√©v√©lation, d'√©preuve termin√©e. Ils se p√¢maient l'un contre l'autre. En effet ils furent rois toute une matin√©e o√π les tentures carmin√©es se relev√®rent sur les maisons, et toute l'apr√®s-midi, o√π ils s'avanc√®rent du c√¥t√© des jardins de palmes. 5\\\\.

Des sifflements de morts et des cercles de musique sourde font monter, s'√©largir et trembler comme un spectre ce corps ador√©: des blessures √©carlates et noires √©clatent dans les chairs superbes. Les couleurs propres de la vie se foncent, dansent, et se d√©gagent autour de la Vision, sur le chantier. Et les frissons s'√©l√®vent et grondent, et la saveur forcen√©e de ces effets se chargeant avec les sifflements mortels et les rauques musiques que le monde, loin derri√®re nous, lance sur notre m√®re de beaut√©, ‚Äîelle recule, elle se dresse.

On January 15, 2015 the first Virgin Hotel opened. In February 2019, Virgin Hotels opened at its second location in San Francisco, CA on 4th street, near to Yerba Buena Gardens. One element of Virgin Hotels' business plan was to acquire distressed properties in North America cheaply during the property downturn, but banks decided to hold distressed real-estate assets until the market for them rebounded rather than sell them so the company fell well behind its planned timetable. Development Further hotels are being planned in New York City and Nashville. The 300 room New York site will be located on the corner of 29th Street and Broadway. The 240 room Nashville property is to be located at One Music Row. The San Francisco hotel opened on 4th street in February 2019.

Liquid fluorine Fluorine condenses to a bright yellow liquid at ‚àí188 ¬∞C (‚àí307 ¬∞F), which is near the condensation temperatures of oxygen and nitrogen. The solid state of fluorine relies on Van der Waals forces to hold molecules together, which, because of the small size of the fluorine molecules, are relatively weak. Consequently, the solid state of fluorine is more similar to that of oxygen or the noble gases than to those of the heavier halogens. Animation showing the crystal structure of beta-fluorine. Fluorine solidifies at ‚àí220 ¬∞C (‚àí363 ¬∞F) into a cubic structure, called beta-fluorine. This phase is transparent and soft, with significant disorder of the molecules; its density is 1.70 g/cm3. At ‚àí228 ¬∞C (‚àí378 ¬∞F) fluorine undergoes a solid‚Äìsolid phase transition into a monoclinic structure called alpha-fluorine.

Both members are flare stars, meaning they are red dwarf stars that undergo random eruptions that increase their brightness. This pair lies physically near the red dwarf star AU Microscopii, which may mean they form a wide triple star system. Observational history In 1926, Dutch-American astronomer Willem Jacob Luyten reported that the lines in the spectrum of this star underwent variation. A photographic plate taken on June 23, 1895, showed bright lines of hydrogen that were much weaker on a plate taken June 29, 1895. A photograph taken on July 1, 1903, showed no such lines. The net variation in brightness of the star was small, not exceeding 0.5 in magnitude. Luyten noted that the star has a large proper motion, changing its position by 0.43 seconds of arc between 1899 and 1923. By 1927, the object was found to be a pair of stars with an angular separation of 2.95 arcseconds. Both were shown to be of 'dwarf Me' type, indicating they are red dwarfs with emission lines in their spectrum. This was the first such pair of matching dwarf Me stars to be discovered. The first parallax measurements of the pair showed an annual shift of about 0.1 arcseconds, while their radial velocity was measured to be +5 km/s away from the Sun. A nearby star HD 197981, later named AU Microscopii, was shown to have a similar radial velocity of +10 km/s. For this reason it was suggested that the three stars are physically associated. Following the discovery in 1949 that certain types of variable stars are characterized by rapid but brief changes in brightness, accompanied by emission lines in their spectrum, in 1954 both HD 196982 A and B were listed as suspected flare stars by Czech solar physicist Zdenƒõk ≈†vestka. With the introduction of photometric instruments to astronomy, the variability of stars could now be monitored over intervals of time. Measurements of HD 196982 during 1969 showed them to be the most active flare stars known at that time: over a period of 16.31 hours, 54 flares were observed. The flares increased the combined magnitude of the pair by more than 0.05 for more than half of this observation period. By 1972, the pair had received the variable star designation AT Microscopii. Properties Position measurements of the pair made with the Hipparcos spacecraft show an annual parallax shift of 0.0935 seconds of arc, which is equivalent to a distance of about from the Sun. It is a binary star system with an angular separation of 4.0 arcseconds. Both members are pre-main sequence, red dwarf stars and are among the youngest of this type in the neighborhood of the Sun. Relative to the Sun, component A has about 27% of the mass and 3.6% of the luminosity, while component B has 25% of the mass and 3.3% of the luminosity. Both members of this system have active stellar coronae, show luminosity variations of the BY Draconis type, and are X-ray emitters. The average flare rate for the pair is 2.8 per hour. Their X-ray spectrum is consistent with a plasma density of around and a magnetic field strength of at least 100 G in the flare regions. Neither star shows any indication of lithium in their spectrum, having depleted this element through nuclear fusion at their cores. This binary system is located in close proximity to the young star AU Microscopii, with a projected separation of . This indicates that the three may form a wide hierarchical triple system, with the AT Microscopii pair orbiting AU Microscopii over a period of 10 million years. All three stars are candidate members of the Beta Pictoris moving group, one of the nearest associations of stars that share a common motion through space. This group averages a distance of about from the Earth, but are scattered across a volume roughly in diameter. Estimates for the age of this group range between 10 and 21 million years.

Grant, Demi√°n Bichir and Emilia Clarke. It was shown at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Safecracker Dom Hemingway (Jude Law) is released after spending 12 years in prison and seeks payment for refusing to rat out his boss Ivan Fontaine (Demi√°n Bichir). He reunites with his best friend Dickie (Richard E. Grant) and they travel to Fontaine's villa in the French countryside. Dom flirts with Fontaine's Romanian girlfriend Paolina (MƒÉdƒÉlina Diana Ghenea) and becomes angry that he spent 12 years in jail for Fontaine. He begins to mock Fontaine and storms out. At dinner, he apologises and Fontaine presents Dom with ¬£750,000. They spend the night partying with two girls, one of whom, Melody (Kerry Condon) strikes up a conversation with Dom. When the group go driving in Fontaine's car, they crash into another car. While unconscious, Dom has a vision of Paolina asking for his money. He wakes up, resuscitates Melody, and finds Fontaine impaled on the car's fender. Melody tells Dom that, because he saved her, he shall gain good luck when he least expects it. Dom and Dickie head back to the mansion, where they find Paolina has taken Dom's money, but they see her leaving in a car. Dom runs through the forest and into the road, where he is almost hit by Paolina. She asks him if she strikes him as a woman who wants to be poor, and drives away. A few days later, Dom returns to London and collapses outside the apartment of his estranged daughter, Evelyn (Emilia Clarke). He wakes up and Evelyn's boyfriend Hugh (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) introduces Dom to his grandson, Jawara. Hugh says that Evelyn is upset that Dom left her and was in prison, missing out on her childhood and his wife Katherine's death. Hugh suggests Dom visit Evelyn after her concert at a local club and attempt to reconcile. He goes to the concert, but leaves and meets Dickie. Dom says he wants to work for Lestor McGreevy Jr., the son of Fontaine's old rival. Dickie says Lestor is even worse than his father, but Dom says he needs work. Dom follows Lestor on his daily jog and learns Lestor holds a grudge for Dom killing his cat when he was a child. Lestor tells Dom to go to his club that night. They make a bet. If he opens an electronic safe he gets work, if he fails to open it in 10 minutes, Lestor will cut off his genitalia. Dom and Dickie go to Lestor's club and Dom opens a safe in 10 minutes with a sledgehammer, only to learn the real safe is inside that safe. Before Lestor can cut off Dom's penis, Dickie smashes Lestor on the head with a statue and Dom knocks out his thugs with the sledgehammer. They run away from Lestor's club and Dom goes back to the local club where Evelyn was performing. There, Evelyn tells Dom he would only have spent three years in prison if he had ratted on Fontaine; because he didn't, he missed out on her childhood and her mother dying. Evelyn tells Dom that all she wanted was a real father. She turns her back on him and leaves. The next day, Dom sees Melody on her scooter and says he hasn't received good luck. She says it will come soon. Dom visits the grave of his wife Katherine and apologises. He turns and sees his grandson Jawara sitting next to him. He walks Jawara out of the cemetery and takes him back to Evelyn. He asks if he can walk with them in silence, but she says they have to hurry home. She says Dom can take Jawara to school on Monday if he doesn't get drunk on Sunday night. As they walk away, Jawara waves to Dom, who waves back. He walks in the opposite direction and sees Paolina enter a restaurant with an older man. He enters the restaurant and grips Paolina's hand. He whispers threats and continues to clutch her hand, before leaving he kisses her. As he leaves the restaurant, he smiles as it is revealed that he has stolen Paolina's diamond ring.

Rosati sued ≈ªu≈Çawski and the book's publisher for violating her right to privacy and dignity as a woman as the book included intimate details about her. She won the case in 2015. In September 2013, she was a passenger in a car driven by her then-partner, Polish actor Piotr Adamczyk, which was involved in a road accident. Due to leg injury sustained in the accident, she was unable to walk, and required several surgeries and a continual long-term physiotherapy, which prevented her from working for several months. Rosati and Adamczyk broke up in 2015. She was engaged to Polish orthopedic surgeon Robert ≈ömigielski, whom she was in relationship with between 2016 and 2018. She gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth Valentina, on 11 December 2017. While in relationship with ≈ömigielski, Rosati experienced domestic abuse. She later became an advocate for domestic abuse victims. As of 2020, Rosati splits her time between homes in Warsaw and Los Angeles. Rosati was included on the annual list of 100 most valuable stars of Polish show business compiled by the Polish edition of Forbes magazine between 2012‚Äì2014. She ranked 84th, 85th, and 83rd, respectively. She was the Polish ambassador of Procter and Gamble hair products Pantene (2004), Dr Irena Eris skin care line and fragrance Sin Skin (2007‚Äì2008), and Avon Products fragrance Femme (2014). She participated in season 10 of Taniec z gwiazdami (Polish version of Dancing with the Stars) in 2009, and was also a guest judge alongside her mother on the second season of Project Runway Poland in 2015, and guest hosted SNL Poland in 2018. Rosati has also written articles about Hollywood stars and cinema for the website Stopklatka and the magazine Film, among others.

See also This station is not to be confused with which was about 250 yards away on the same street and which was also called \\"Staveley Town\\" from opening in 1892 until it was renamed by British Railways in 1950. Nor is it to be confused with which in its early years was named \\"Staveley\\". Barrow Hill was the next stop along the line towards from Staveley Town. Nor is it to be confused with between and in Cumbria. Context The station was on the circuitous to line via Clowne and Barlborough and the equally circuitous Barrow Hill to via line. These routes diverged at Seymour Junction, about half a mile to the east of the station. The line to Pleasley was known as the Doe Lea Branch because it followed the River Doe Lea for several miles. The line to Creswell was known as the Clowne Branch. History The station opened without ceremony on 1 November 1888 for services along the Clowne Branch. It was initially called Netherthorpe, being in the Netherthorpe area of Staveley. On 25 October 1893, it became \\"Netherthorpe for Staveley Town\\". It was renamed \\"Staveley Town\\" on 1 June 1900. Services calling at the station increased with the opening of the Doe Lea Branch on 1 September 1890.The service in 1890 Old Miner The station was situated in a cutting between the Lowgates overbridge and a footbridge from Fan Road to Netherthorpe, both of which survive. It had two opposing platforms with small buildings on each of which no trace remains. There was a further building at street level which survived for many years after closure, having been bought privately for commercial use. Normal passenger traffic over the Doe Lea Branch ceased in 1930 and the route was severed by the closure of Rowthorn Tunnel near Hardwick Hall. Coal traffic nevertheless remained the lifeblood of the line. The station closed to passenger traffic on 5 August 1952. In the 1960s pits began to be worked out. Ramcroft Colliery near Glapwell closed in 1966, followed by Glapwell Colliery in 1974 after which the line beyond fell into disuse. The line between Bolsover and Glapwell Colliery was taken out of use as from 31 October 1978; it was eventually lifted later in 1978. Bolsover and Markham Collieries continued to produce coal in large quantities. This was supplemented by traffic to and from the Coalite and Chemical Works at Bolsover. Bolsover Castle station remained open for goods until 1 November 1962 and in usable condition for passenger traffic at least until 1981, which led to some remarkable trains, notably by Miners' Welfare specials to distant points and by specials in connection with the Queen's Jubilee in 1977. These passed through the site of Staveley Town station. The last steam trains to use the line were enthusiasts' specials. On 16 October 1965 a \\"Last 4F\\" Midlands Tour ran along the Clowne Branch and to Glapwell then through the site of Staveley Town. On 1 October 1966 an RCTS Notts & Yorks railtour passed through and is believed to have been the very last. Normal passenger traffic over the Clowne Branch ceased in 1954. Remarkably, the very last train was operated by a brand new Diesel Multiple Unit. Timetabled Summer weekend excursion traffic, notably from to Blackpool continued until 1962, along with football specials. These duly passed through the site of Staveley Town.Site of Staveley Town: via PictureThePast Occasional freight and light engine movements over the Clowne Branch continued until the 1990s when an underground fire threatened to undermine the line, compounded by the expensive need to replace the points connecting the branch to what is now known as the Robin Hood Line at Elmton and Creswell. These points were replaced by plain line, as were those at Oxcroft Colliery Junction. The single track between is largely intact, but heavily overgrown. Bolsover Colliery closed in 1993 and Markham Colliery closed in 1994, followed by Coalite in 2004, which left no traffic on the Doe Lea Branch. A temporary reprieve for the line through the site of Staveley Town station was obtained following the closure of Arkwright Colliery in 1988. The Arkwright site was eventually opencasted then landscaped, with startling visual impact. The opencasted coal was transported by lorry along the trackbed of the Great Central Main Line north of Arkwright, thence to Oxcroft Disposal Point near Shuttlewood where it was loaded onto Merry-go-Round (MGR) trains which ran through Oxcroft Colliery Junction, Seymour Junction,the station site and Hall Lane Junction to join the ex-MR Chesterfield to Rotherham \\"Back Line\\" at Foxlow Junction. This traffic came to a natural end in 2006. On 4 March 2006 the Branch Line Society ran a \\"last train\\" special through the station site to the disposal point boundary. Possible Futures The line through the station site to Seymour Junction and Oxcroft Disposal Point has been mothballed as there remains the possibility of opencasting in the area. For example, in 2005 UK Coal (now Coalfield Resources), expressed an interest in extracting c530,000 tons near Mastin Moor. The Doe Lea line South to Bolsover (now known as \\"The Bolsover Branch\\") has been mothballed as it runs through the new Markham Vale Enterprise Zone at M1 Junction 29A It is hoped that someone will invest in this infrastructure to create road-rail interchange facilities. The branch beyond Bolsover is now a public bridleway known as The Stockley Trail.

History The royal pavilion Frydenlund painted by Johan Jacob Bruun in 1749 The first structure at the site was a hunting lodge built just north of the royal deer park J√¶gersborg Dyrehave which was established in 1670. It was acquired by Conrad von Reventlow in the 1680s. Originally from Holstein, he now lived at Clausholm Castle and gave the pavilion the name Freudenlund. After his death, the property was passed on to his daughter, Anne Sophie, who married King Frederick IV Morganatically in 1712. From 1722 to 1726, after their second marriage in 1721, which gave Anne Sophie status of queen, court architect Johan Cornelius Krieger carried out an expansion of Frydenlund. In the first half of the 1740s, the house was put at the disposal of General Charles Christian Erdmann, Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Oels along with the W√ºrttemberg Mansion in Copenhagen (now Lerches G√•rd). King Frederick V refurbished the house and gave it to Crown Prince Christian in 1760. In connection with their marriage in 1764, he gave Frydendal to Queen Caroline Mathilde. It was the preferred hideaway for her and Struense during their love affair. A new wooden mansion designed by Caspar Frederik Harsdorff was built in Lille Dyrehave in 1770. Later changes Frydenlund's vatehouse painted by Karl Schou in 1915 Harsdorff's mansion was destroyed by fire in 1793. The Crown then sold the estate to Karl Adolf Boheman, a Swedish mystic, Freemason, merchant who worked for the mystic society \\"The Enlightened of Avignon\\" on the commission of Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel. He refurbished and expanded Krieger's old house with the assistance of J√∏rgen Henrich Rawert. Recent history American-Danish entertainer Victor Borge purchased the property in 1957. In 1960, he sold it to Haldor Tops√∏e who established a research centre in the buildings. Architecture The house viewed from the orchard1749 The current house is a three-winged Neoclassical building. The architect is unknown but may have been. Jrieger's original house from the 1720s was a tall, octagonal building with timber framing. It is still clearly visible as a rounded projection on the main wing. The complex was listed in 1918. The architectural firm Berten && Schewing was commissioned to make a masterplan for restoration and development of the buildings in 2010.  Owners * (-1669) H. Ehm (kobberm√∏lle) * (1670-1683) M.

Mining is important to the national economy of Mongolia. Mongolia is one of the 29 resource-rich developing countries identified by the International Monetary Fund and exploration of copper and coal deposits are generating substantial additional revenue. Coal, copper, and gold are the principal reserves mined in Mongolia. Several gold mines are located about north of Ulaanbaatar, such as Boroo Gold Mine and Gatsuurt Gold Mine. Khotgor Coal Mine is an open-pit coal mining site about west of Ulaangom. √ñmn√∂govi Province in the south of Mongolia is home to large scale mining projects such as the Tavan Tolgoi coal mine and the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine. Oyu Tolgoi mine is reported to have the potential to boost the national economy by a third but is subject to dispute over how the profits should be shared. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated that 71 percent of the income from the mine would go to Mongolia. Mongolia Energy Corporation, a mining and energy company operating in Mongolia and Xinjiang and Erdenet Mining Corporation, a joint Mongolian-Russian venture, account for a large percentage of the mining in the country, but Anglo-Australian companies such as Rio Tinto and Canadian companies such as Turquoise Hill Resources are active in the country and have agreements with the government. The government institution responsible for overseeing mining development in the country is the Mineral Resource Authority of Mongolia (MRAM). Coal mining Tavan Tolgoi coal mine in √ñmn√∂govi Province Mongolia hosts 10% of the world's known coal reserves at an estimated 162 billion tonnes in 2011 with 17 operating coal mines. Mongolia exported 73% of the 25 million tons of coal produced in 2010, making it the country's largest export (which had previously been copper). The largest customer for coal was China, accounting for over 82% of all exported coal. The Tavan Tolgoi, the largest coal site in Mongolia, which has high-grade coal deposits is expected to yield six billion tonnes of coal. While the biggest client for this coal is China (Mongolia's trade with China is about 85%), Russia is also likely to be bidder for this coal once the 1,000-kilometre (621-mile) rail link to the country is completed; Japan, Korea and Taiwan are also likely to be beneficiaries to this coal through the Trans- Siberian railway. Mongolia has also initiated coal based power projects and coal-washing plants which will be beneficial to its economic advancement. Coal mining companies include Hunnu Coal. Copper mining Shaft #1 at Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in √ñmn√∂govi Province Erdenet Mining Corporation is a joint venture between the governments of Mongolia and Russia and was established in 1976. Erdenet was accounted for 14% of Mongolia's gross domestic product (GDP). While the mine has been exporting copper concentrate since production began, there are plans to create industry within the country to manufacture finished products (such as copper wire) from concentrate from the mine. In 2001 Canadian-based Ivanhoe Mines (now known as Turquoise Hill Resources) discovered the gold-copper ore deposit of what would be developed into the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The deposit is in the Gobi Desert in an area known as Oyu Tolgoi (Mongolian for Turquoise Hill), where in the time of Genghis Khan outcropping rocks were smelted for copper. By 2003 there were 18 exploration drill rigs on the property employing approximately 200 people, and Oyu Tolgoi was the \\"biggest mining exploration project in the world.\\" In January 2013 Oyu Tolgoi started producing concentrate from the mine. Its location in the South Gobi province, is 50 miles away from the border with China and is termed as a mega- mine in Mongolia. Its mining operations are a joint venture of Rio Tinto (a UK-based mining transnational), Ivanhoe Mines of Canada and the Mongolian government. As of 2010, the estimated cost of bringing the Oyu Tolgoi mine into production was US$4.6 billion, making it (financially) the largest project in Mongolian history; however, by 2013 costs had increased to $10 billion. When in production Oyu Tolgoi will account for more than 30% of Mongolia's GDP. The copper production from this mine (the investment was reported to be of the order of US$5 billion) has been projected at 450,000 tonnes of copper for the next 50 years; the mining reserves are reported to extend up to 20 miles beneath the Gobi Desert and is also estimated to yield 330,000 ounces of gold annually. A comparative analysis of its progress in 2011 revealed that it exceeded China's progress by double and recorded a 17% growth which has even generated a comment in some quarters that it is no more Mongolia but \\"Minegolia\\". Junior mining company Kincora Copper has announced plans to conduct exploration along strike of the Oyu Tolgoi mine with drilling planned in 2017. Gold mining The gold mines of importance are the Zaamar gold mine, the Boroo hard rock gold mine (discovered and extracted since 1979 by open cast mining), Gatsuurt Gold Mine, and tracer gold extraction by the process of dredging the Tuul River. In addition to Copper, Oyu Tolgoi also has large reserves of gold, and the deposit is assessed to contain 14 million ounces of gold in addition to the 19 million tons of copper. This huge ore deposit is stated to be the second largest discovered and valued at US$46 billion at 2003 prices. Other minerals Molybdenum has been found at Erdenet-Ovoo and silver found in Asgat and both are under mining. Uranium is found in Dornod and its mining extraction is a joint venture of Russia and Japan. At Dornod, Russia started mining uranium from 1995 but has been discontinued for some time. The Red Book 2011, Mongolia assessed uranium resources at 74,000 tU, as aginsy a geological prospecting report it could go up to 1.47 million tU. Other areas where uranium prospecting has been fruitful are the Mongol-Priargun uranium province and Gurvanbulag apart from Dornod, in the east and northeast of the country in a volcanogenic mineralisation formation. It is also found in the Gobi-Tamsag uranium province in southern Mongolia which are part of sediments in smaller Dulaan Uul and Nars deposits. Illegal mining Many illegal miners in Mongolia are referred to as ninja miners. They get the name from the resemblance the green bowls they carry on their backs (which are used to pan for gold) have to the shells of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. After the fall of the People's Republic of Mongolia many people became traditional herders. Two harsh winters in the early 2000s resulted in a massive loss in livestock. After this thousands of Mongolians turned to illegal mining on properties abandoned by larger mining companies.Channel 4 UK TV program \\"Unreported World\\", 7.30 to 8.00 pm, Friday 15 June 2007 Impact Cashmere wool The mining activities also have several negative impacts which need timely remedial interventions. The social impacts relate to: A negative feeling that politicians and the rich would exploit the revenue denying benefits to the poor; the resource is non-renewable and could last for another 100 years or so and during this time the traditional livestock herding which sustained the country through its ancient Mongolian cashmere industry (the Gobi Cashmere Company in Ulan Bator is feeling the pinch) should not be allowed to wither away (an example cited in this regard is that of the Netherlands where the Shipbuilding industries went into a tailspin after that country embarked on exploitation of offshore oil; it could turn out to be a \\"resource curse\\" as in the case of Nigeria or \\"Dutch Disease\\" as in the case of the Netherlands when they found oil to exploit. It is perceived that in the enthusiasm to mine mineral resources, the government authorities are not paying adequate attention to enforce environmental laws and in monitoring of natural resource base. Some of the issues cited are: Encroachment of pasture lands for building houses and airport to meet the needs of the mine owners; extraction of the meager water resources (of lakes, water holes and ground water) to meet the large water requirements (requirement for the new copper mines alone is reported to be about 920 liter of water per second during its agreed period of operations) for mining operations affecting the surface and ground water sources (wells are drying up); dirt ridden clouds enveloping the villages, day and night, as the trucks carrying coal and other minerals move on the dirt roads creating health hazards for people as well as to cattle; oft repeated refrain of the people is that there will be \\"more dust and less water.\\"Mining boom in Mongolia, CEE Bankwatch Network. Economic incentives to people Initially, under the Human and Development Fund generated by mining operations, outright cash was distributed to the people. The future plans drawn by the government envisages coverage of health insurance to people, provided free public housing and free education. Under the Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi (ETT) a state enterprise, every citizen shall get 536 shares as an investment in the mining work. Environmental mitigation measures Addressing the environmental concerns raised by the people it is now proposed to build permanent tarred roads to avoid dust. Water extraction will be done from fossil aquifers, which will be treated for removing salinity and used for mining operations and not from lakes and water holes. Water shall be recycled and not let out to flow. Special under passages for animals to cross shall be built wherever required. Taxation In 2006 Mongolia implemented a 68% windfall tax, which was the world's highest. The tax was based on profits made by mining companies on copper and gold sales above $2,600 per ton and $850 per ounce respectively. The tax was repealed in 2009 and phased out over the next two years.

It consists of a group of microphones, also called a microphone array, from which signals are simultaneously collected and processed to form a representation of the location of the sound sources.  Terminology  The term acoustic camera has first appeared at the end of the 19th century: A physiologist, J.R. Ewald, was investigating the function of the inner ear and introduced an analogy with the Chladni plates (a domain nowadays called Cymatics), a device enabling to visually see the modes of vibration of a plate. He called this device an acoustic camera. The term has then been widely used during the 20th century to designate various types of acoustic devices, such as underwater localization systems or active systems used in medicine. It designates nowadays any transducer array used to localize sound sources (the medium is usually the air), especially when coupled with an optical camera.  Technology   General principles  An acoustic camera generally consists of a microphone array and optionally an optical camera. The microphones ‚Äì analog or digital ‚Äì are acquired simultaneously or with known relative time delays to be able to use the phase difference between the signals. As the sound propagates in the medium (air, water...) at a finite known speed, a sound source is perceived by the microphones at different time instants and at different sound intensities that depend on both the sound source location and the microphone location. One popular method to obtain an acoustic image from the measurement of the microphone is to use beamforming: By delaying each microphone signal relatively and adding them, the signal coming from a specific direction \\\\left(\\\\theta_0, \\\\phi_0\\\\right) is amplified while signals coming from other directions are canceled. The power of this resulting signal is then calculated and reported on a power map at a pixel corresponding to the direction \\\\left(\\\\theta_0, \\\\phi_0\\\\right) . The process is iterated at each direction where the power needs to be computed. While this method has many advantages ‚Äì robustness, easy to understand, highly parallelizable because each direction can be computed independently, versatile (there exist many types of beamformers to include various types of hypothesis), relatively fast ‚Äì it also has some drawbacks: the produced acoustic map has artifacts (also called side lobes or ghost sources) and it does not model correctly correlated sound sources. Various methods have been introduced to reduce the artifacts such as DAMAS or to take in account correlated sources such as CLEAN-SC, both at the price of a higher computational cost. When the sound sources are near the acoustic camera, the relative intensity perceived by the different microphones as well as the waves not being any more seen as planar but spherical by the acoustic camera add new information compared to the case of sources being far from the camera. It enables to use more effective methods such as acoustic holography. = Reprojection = Results of far-field beamforming can be reprojected onto planar or non-planar surfaces.  Two-dimensional  Some acoustic cameras use two-dimensional acoustic mapping, which uses a unidirectional microphone array (e.g. a rectangle of microphones, all facing the same direction). Two-dimensional acoustic mapping works best when the surface to be examined is planar and the acoustic camera can be set up facing the surface perpendicularly. However, the surfaces of real-world objects are not often flat, and it is not always possible to optimally position the acoustic camera.Meyer, Andy, and D√∂bler, Dirk. \\"Noise source localization within a car interior using 3D-microphone arrays.\\" Proceedings of the BeBeC (2006). Additionally, the two-dimensional method of acoustic mapping introduces error into the calculations of the sound intensity at a point. Two-dimensional mapping approximates three-dimensional surfaces into a plane, allowing the distance between each microphone and the focus point to be calculated relatively easily. However, this approximation ignores the distance differences caused by surfaces having different depths at different points. In most applications of the acoustic camera, this error is small enough to be ignored; however, in confined spaces, the error becomes significant.  Three-dimensional  Three-dimensional acoustic cameras fix the errors of two-dimensional cameras by taking into account surface depths, and therefore correctly measuring the distances between the microphone and each spatial point. These cameras produce a more accurate picture, but require a 3-D model of the object or space being analyzed. Additionally, if the acoustic camera picks up sound from a point in space that is not part of the model, the sound may be mapped to a random space in the model, or the sound may not show up at all. 3-D acoustic cameras can also be used to analyze confined spaces, such as room interiors; however, in order to do this, a microphone array that is omnidirectional (e.g. a sphere of microphones, each facing a different direction) is required. This is in addition to the first requirement of having a 3-D model.  Applications  There are many applications of the acoustic camera, with most focusing on noise reduction. The camera is frequently applied to improve the noise emission of vehicles (such as cars, airplanes) and trains, structures‚Äîsuch as wind turbines. Acoustic cameras are not only used to measure the exterior emission of products but also to improve the comfort inside cabins of cars, train or airplanes. Spherical acoustic camera are preferred in this type of application because the three-dimensional placement of the microphone allows to localize sound sources in all directions. Troubleshooting of faults that occur in machines and mechanical parts can be accomplished with an acoustic camera. To find where the problem lies, the sound mapping of a properly functional machine can be compared to one of a dysfunctional machine. A similar setup of the acoustic camera can be used to study the noise inside passenger carts during train operation. Alternatively, the camera can be set up outside, in an area near the train tracks, to observe the train as it goes by. This can give another perspective of the noise that might be heard inside the train. Additionally, an outside setup can be used to examine the squealing of train wheels caused by a curve in the tracks.  Challenges   Dynamic range   Low frequencies in the far-field   Computational power  The signal processing required by the acoustic camera is very intensive and needs powerful hardware and plenty of memory storage. Because of this, signal processing is frequently done after the recording of data, which can hinder or prevent the use of the camera in analyzing sounds that only occur occasionally or at varying locations. Cameras that do perform signal processing in real time tend to be large and expensive. Hardware and signal processing improvements can help to overcome these difficulties. Signal processing optimizations often focus on reduction of computational complexity, storage requirements, and memory bandwidth (rate of data consumption).Zimmermann, B.; Studer, C., \\"FPGA-based real-time acoustic camera prototype,\\" Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on , vol., no., pp.1419,1419, May 30 2010-June 2 2010  References   External links  *http://blog.prosig.com/2010/03/15/comparison-between-sound-intensity-probes- and-acoustic-cameras/  Manufacturer links  *https://www.sorama.eu/ *https://www.acoustic-camera.com/ *https://www.cae-systems.de/en/ *https://www.distran.ch/ *https://www.fluke.com/en-us/product/industrial- imaging/sonic-industrial-imager-ii900 *https://nlacoustics.com/ *https://web2.norsonic.com/product-cat/acoustic-camera/ *https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/simcenter- sound-camera.html *http://www.signalinterface.com/index.html *http://smins.co.kr/en/ *https://www.microflown.com/ Category:Acoustics Category:Imaging ","title":"Acoustic camera"},{"id":"39369529","text":"Arbuckle Place is a historic home located at Assawoman, Accomack County, Virginia.

E. caninus has been observed in two morphotypes; the first population being \\"pauciflorum,\\" with the second being \\"caninus.\\" Found in the forest regions throughout Europe and stretching as far as west Asia, Elymus caninus is a type of self-pollinating wheatgrass. It is described as green, lax-leafed, and caespitose. The widespread distribution of E. caninus has led to sizable differences in morphology, isozyme, prolamine, and DNA levels. Morphological differences seen throughout E. caninus populations include: the number of florets per spikelet, the length of lemma awn, and the pubescence of leaves and their sheaths. Populations from China, Italy, Pakistan, and Russia were determined to have the lowest levels of intra-population variation among E. caninus morphologies. These lower levels may be due to selection factors, population bottlenecks, genetic drift, or a combination of the bunch. While generally a self-pollinating perennial, the rate of outcrossing varies among Elymus caninus populations. This outcrossing occurs when the species florets are open during anthesis. Researchers determined that when E. caninus is grown near or among other Elymus species (specifically studied were E. mutabilis and E. fibrosus), hybridization occurred and these hybrids were mainly found to be sterile. Populations of E. caninus grown among other Elymus species showed higher levels of variation when compared to populations grown alone. This finding shows that gene flow may be occurring between the Elymus species‚Äô and that the gene flow is one-sided (E. mutabilis to E. caninus). Backing up the one-sided gene flow into Elymus caninus, an introgression study of Triticum aestivum into E. caninus populations was performed in order to determine if a hybridization would occur in which no spontaneous hybridizations were shown. This concludes that an introgression of the T. aestivum traits into the E. caninus population were improbable, disregarding the fact that these populations tend to grow in the same vicinity. Being an allotetraploid, E. caninus derives its genome (StStHH) from both new and old world Pseudoroegneria (St) as well as from the small-seeded Hordeum (H) species. A study completed in 1999 concluded that the fixed heterozygosity without segregation leads to the conclusion that E. caninus is allotetraploid by nature. A fixed heterozygosity occurs when the diploid parental genomes are homozygous for different alleles, and this trait has been reported in other Elymus species.

Jamming occurs when non-target sounds interfere with target echoes. Jamming can be purposeful or inadvertent, and can be caused by the echolocation system itself, other echolocating animals, prey, or humans. Echolocating animals have evolved to minimize jamming; however, echolocation avoidance behaviors are not always successful.  Self jamming  Echolocating animals can jam themselves in a number of ways. Bats, for example, produce some of the loudest sounds in nature, and then they immediately listen for echoes that are hundreds of times fainter than the sounds they emit. To avoid deafening themselves, whenever a bat makes an echolocation emission, a small muscle in the bat's middle ear (the stapedius muscle) clamps down on small bones called ossicles, which normally amplify sounds between the ear drum and the cochlea. This dampens the intensity of the sounds that the bat hears during this time, preserving hearing sensitivity to target echoes. Jamming can occur if an animal is still producing a sound when an echo returns, for example, from a nearby object. Bats avoid this type of jamming by producing short sounds of 3-50 ms when searching for prey or navigating. Bats produce progressively shorter sounds, down to 0.5 ms, to avoid self-jamming when echolocating targets that they are approaching. This is because echoes from nearby targets will return to the bat sooner than sounds from distant targets. Another form of jamming occurs when an echolocating animal produces many sounds in succession and assigns an echo to the wrong emission. To avoid this type of jamming, bats typically wait enough time for echoes to return from all possible targets before making the next sound. This can be seen clearly when a bat attacks an insect. The bat produces sounds with progressively shorter time intervals, but always allowing enough time for sounds to travel to the target and back. Another way bats overcome this problem is by producing successive sounds with unique time- frequency structures. This allows bats to process echoes from multiple emissions at the same time, and to correctly assign an echo to its emission using its time-frequency signature.  Jamming by other echolocation systems  Like electric fish, echolocating animals are susceptible to jamming from other animals of the same species emitting signals in the nearby environment. To avoid such jamming, bats use a strategy also employed by electric fish to avoid this jamming: a behavior known as jamming avoidance response (JAR). In a JAR, one or both animals change the frequency of their sounds away from that used by the other animal. This has the effect of allowing each animal a unique frequency bandwidth where jamming will not occur. Bats can make this adjustment very rapidly, often in less than 0.2 seconds. Big brown bats can avoid jamming by going silent for periods of time when following another echolocating big brown bat. This sometimes allows the silent bat to capture a prey in competitive foraging situations.  Jamming by prey  The moth Bertholdia trigona is the only animal in nature known to jam the echolocation of its predator Many tiger moths produce ultrasonic clicks in response to the echolocation calls bats use while attacking prey. For most species of tiger moth these clicks warn bats that the moths have toxic compounds that make them distasteful. However, the tiger moth Bertholdia trigona produces clicks at a very high rate (up to 4,500 per second) to jam bat echolocation. Jamming is the most effective defense against bats ever documented, with jamming causing a ten-fold decrease in bat capture success in the field.  History  The possibility that moths jam bat echolocation arose with an experiment report published in 1965 by Dorothy Dunning and Kenneth Roeder. Moth clicks were played through a loudspeaker as bats tried to capture mealworms catapulted through the air. Moth clicks caused bats to veer away from the mealworms, but echolocation calls played through the speaker did not, causing the authors to conclude that the moth clicks themselves dissuaded the bats. However, it was later determined that the moth clicks were played at an unnaturally loud level, invalidating this conclusion. In subsequent years Dunning conducted further experiments to show that moth clicks serve a warning function. That is, they communicate to bats that the moths are toxic, as many moths accumulate toxic chemicals from their host plants as caterpillars and keep them in their tissues through adulthood. Roeder agreed with Dunning‚Äôs findings. James Fullard and colleagues published findings in 1979, and 1994 arguing in favor of the jamming hypothesis based on the acoustic characteristics of moth clicks, however this hypothesis was still widely debated in the literature during that time. In the 1990s experiments were conducted broadcasting clicks to bats performing echolocation tasks on a platform and with neurophysiological methods to demonstrate a plausible mechanism for jamming. The researchers concluded that most tiger moths do not produce enough sound to jam bat sonar. The first study to conclusively demonstrate that moths jam bats was published in 2009 by researchers at Wake Forest University. In this study big brown bats were raised in captivity to ensure they had no prior experience with clicking prey and trained to attack moths tethered to a thin line attached to the ceiling in an indoor flight room. Over a nine-night experiment the bats attacked non-clicking control moths and clicking Bertholdia trigona ‚Äì moths that were selected for their extraordinary clicking abilities. Bats had substantial difficulty catching the clicking moths compared to silent controls, and ate the B. trigona moths when they had the opportunity, thus refuting the hypothesis that the clicks were warning the bats of moths‚Äô toxicity. Moth clicks also disrupted the stereotypical pattern of the bats echolocation, confirming the clicks‚Äô jamming function.  Humans jamming animals  Humans may jam echolocating animals deliberately or accidentally. Recent efforts have been made to develop acoustic jamming deterrents to exclude bats from buildings or bridges, or to keep bats away from wind turbines where large numbers of mortalities occur. These deterrents have been shown to reduce bat activity over a small area. However, scaling up acoustic deterrents to large volumes for applications such as keeping bats away from wind turbines is difficult because of the high atmospheric attenuation of ultrasound.

It preserves the largest continuous tract of coastal temperate rainforest in the world. Beginning at the head of Gardner Canal, the park stretches inland along the Kitlope River to the border of Tweedsmuir Provincial Park. History The Kitlope River area is within the ancestral homeland of the Haisla people. The Haisla used the area for hunting and fishing, especially the production of oolichan grease, for which the tribe was famous along the Pacific coast. By the early 1990s, the West Fraser Timber logging company had acquired logging leases for large tracts of forest in the drainage. The Haisla, along with Portland, Oregon-based advocacy group Ecotrust, lobbied the company and the provincial government to place a moratorium on logging in the watershed. In 1994, West Fraser agreed to relinquish its lease without compensation. In consultation with the Haisla Nation, the provincial government established a Protected Area around the Kitlope on February 20, 1996. In 2008, it was renamed a Conservancy, reflecting the co-management of the park by BC Parks and the Haisla. Conservancies in the park system are a lower level of protection than full Provincial Parks, allowing \\"low-impact\\" economic activities such as eco-tourism, but prohibiting heavy industries such as logging, mining, power generation and road construction. The push for a park in the Kitlope valley was part of a larger effort to protect more of the coastal temperate rainforest in B.C., an ecological zone that has been heavily logged in the south of the province. The Kitlope region is considered part of the Great Bear Rainforest (GBR), a term coined by environmental groups. The Conservancy was the first major portion of the GBR to receive protection. Geography The Conservancy covers of coastal temperate rainforest, making it the largest such preserve in the world. It lies at the head of the Whidbey Reach of the Gardner Canal, and encompasses the drainages of the Kitlope, Kalitan, Gamsby, Tsaytis, Kapella, and Tezwa rivers. During the spring melt, these rivers are subject to heavy flooding and carry large amounts of debris. Much of the park is mountainous; south of the Kitlope River the granite domes and ridges are part of the Kitlope Range, a sub-range of the Kitimat Ranges. In the north, they form part of the Tochquonyalla Range, a sub-range of the Tahtsa Ranges. Icefields and glaciers occupy the higher elevations. The valley floors of the park are narrow, most being between one and two kilometres wide. Many, such as the Gamsby valley, are covered by braided channels of gravel deposited by the rivers. The park has one major lake, Kitlope, which is fed by the Tezwa River and enters the Kitlope River near its estuary. The park is part of a large continuous area of protected wilderness. Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, which abuts Kitlope in the northeast, is the largest protected area in the province. The Fiordland Conservancy protects over 80,000 hectares of coastal fjords on the KHC's western boundary. Together the major parks and several smaller reserves represent over 2.3 million hectares of undeveloped land in a variety of ecological zones.

It is the only surviving High Victorian Gothic commercial building in Grand Rapids and one of only a few High Victorian buildings in the city. The building originally had an \\"L\\"-shaped layout; the head of the \\"L\\" formed the narrow facade on Pearl Street and the foot of the \\"L\\" had a couple storefronts on a former pedestrian walkway.

The Abbey had been founded in 1265 by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, styled King of the Romans,'Parishes: Burnham with Lower Boveney', A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 3 (1925), pp. 165-184 Retrieved 12 May 2013. the brother of King Edward III, who endowed it with several manors, including the manors of Burnham and Cippenham. The Abbey, of which only some old walls and a fishpond remained in the mid-1800s, was situated about a half-mile from Burnham. At the dissolution of the monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII, Burnham Abbey's revenues were valued at ¬£51 2s 4-1/2d. The document of surrender, dated 19 September 1539, was signed by Alice Baldwin, as Abbess, and the nine remaining nuns who were still living there at the time. In return, it is said, for her readiness to surrender the Abbey to the Crown, Alice Baldwin was granted a small pension. After the surrender she appears to have spent her remaining years at Aylesbury at the home of her father, Sir John Baldwin, who both by deed and in his will left her well provided for with a life estate in his lands. Sir John Baldwin died on 24 October 1545, and Alice survived him by only a few months; her will was proved on 2 March 1546. After Alice's death Sir John Baldwin's heirs at law, Sir Thomas Pakington and John Borlase (c.1528 ‚Äì 6 May 1593) inherited the Baldwin estates. Sir John Baldwin had been buried in Aylesbury Church, and in her will Alice requested that her executor erect a tomb of marble over his grave with figures depicting her father and mother and their children. It appears that Alice's executor, Richard Cupper (d.1584), carried out this request, although no trace of the monument now remains in Aylesbury Church.Cupper (Couper), Richard (by 1519-83/84), of London, Powick and Worcester, History of Parliament Retrieved 12 May 2013. In 1518 Sir John Baldwin had married for a second time, and Alice Baldwin was survived by her stepmother, Anne (n√©e Norris), widow of William Wroughton (d. before 1515), and daughter of Sir William Norris (d.1507) of Yattendon, Berkshire, by his third wife, Anne Horne. Anne had become insane before Baldwin's death, and shortly afterwards was placed in the care of her kinswoman, Mary (n√©e Norris) Carew (d.1570), widow of Vice-Admiral Sir George Carew (c.1504 ‚Äì 19 July 1545), and daughter of Henry Norris (b. before 1500, d. 1536) of Bray, Berkshire, and his wife, Mary.Wroughton, Sir William (1509/10-59), of Broad Hinton, Wiltshire, History of Parliament Retrieved 13 May 2013.Baldwin, John (1468/69-1545), of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, History of Parliament Retrieved 13 May 2013.

In 1544 a grant of the site of the abbey surrendered by Alice Baldwin was made to William Tyldesley, a Groom of the Chamber, and in 1574 Queen Elizabeth granted a lease of the property to Paul Wentworth, who had married Tyldesley's widow, Helen. In 1569, during Wentworth's tenure, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, was detained there before being sent to the Tower of London.

Episodes Critical reception Reviews for the show were mixed. It currently holds a 41% approval rating with an average score of 5.69/10 on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. The consensus states: \\"Gang Related focuses more on being dark and edgy than delivering an original narrative, resulting in a fairly ordinary cop drama.\\" It has also received mixed critical reception on Metacritic, with a Metascore of 52, signifying \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Dorothy Rabinowitz at The Wall Street Journal wrote: \\"the writing is sharp, the atmosphere thick with tension from, among other things, car and foot chases\\". In contrast, The Hollywood Reporters Tim Goodman wrote: \\"it's pretty clear right away that you're dealing with a pile of clich√©s that, pushed together and financed, can never be more than dreadful\\". Development In January 2013, Fox announced that it had received a pilot order for the project. In February 2013, Ramon Rodriguez was the first to be cast as the protagonist Ryan Lopez - a gang member sent in to infiltrate the LAPD. Shortly after, Sung Kang was cast in the role of Tae Kim, Asian gang specialist on loan from the FBI who refuses to celebrate Ryan's achievements because he considers Ryan's tactics dangerous and wasteful. Jay Hernandez later joined the cast as Daniel Acosta, gang lord Javier Acosta's son, and Ryan's best friend since childhood. In March 2013, RZA and Cliff Curtis were then added to the cast with Curtis cast in the role of Javier Acosta, the head of one of the most dangerous gangs in Los Angeles.

Heikkenen, Architectural Research Files, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. See also Cary Carson and Carl R. Lounsbury, The Chesapeake House: Architectural Investigation by Colonial Williamsburg, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2013 The house is a single story, single-pile, three-bay, brick structure. The mason hired to construct it laid its brickwork in an extraordinary fashion, which reflects its early date. He set glazed brick headers in large chevron patterns in recessed panels between the front windows and door. He seemed also to have raised the chimneys as exterior features, but they were demolished and rebuilt as interior stacks in the 19th century. To date no archaeological evidence for their original form have been found. Timber work in the house is as unusual as the brickwork. The carpenter raised the roof in common rafter pairs with rafters set flat, as is typical of early work. He spiked the rafters to a tilted false plate. While one would expect these details, the setting of the false plate directly over the brick wall is unusual. The reason for this alignment of the false plate allows for kick rafters, common to late 17th and early 18th century buildings, and for a boxed cornice, the latter quite unusual for country dwellings in the Chesapeake at this date. This is the earliest recorded tilted false plate in the mid-Atlantic states that includes a boxed cornice. The carpenter then covered the roof with weatherboards to act as sheathing for wooden shingles that were pegged (instead of nailed) in place. Dormers which survived until recently date to the late 18th century, reportedly replacing wider ones thought to have been part of the original construction. Original mantels do not survive, but window frames, sash, door trim and the staircase do. In general, the trim is spare but distinctive. At least one door architrave used on the ground floor includes a wide plane that transitions to the adjoining plaster wall with a cyma in a manner uncharacteristic of typical Georgian-era work. Similar architraves were used at Larkin's Hundred, a ca. 1740 dwelling in Anne Arundel County Maryland, and in the original 1740s wing of Myrtle Grove in Talbot County on Maryland's Eastern Shore. The joiner built the stair as a closed string, with heavy, symmetrically-turned balusters set over a skirt board finished as an Ionic entablature complete with a pulvinated frieze. A large, molded newel post is reminiscent of late 17th-century work in England and its handrail, molded in the form of early Georgian work, is quite large in cross section. The rail and molded treads are made of oak. Partitions between first-floor rooms are of frame construction. That between the passage and the \\"hall\\" was originally insulated for sound with \\"filling\\"‚Äîa clay material packed between the wall studs. The baseboard was installed and painted black (with some of the paint slopping onto the filling) before the wall was plastered. Widely spaced riven lath was then nailed to the studs to help to bind the plaster to the walls. Such widely spaced plaster lath, while uncommon in the period, is nevertheless frequently discovered on the Shore, most recently at Grape Valley (1742), nearby in Birdsnest. The house is an early example of one laid out with a center passage. A parlor (or master bedchamber) and hall flank the passage on the ground floor. Two chambers flank the passage in the attic. A frame wing was added in the late 19th century. Researchers at Colonial Williamsburg discovered a handmade paint brush used during original construction as a wedge to prop the front wall plate in position. Masons then sealed it when they plastered the interior wall, attesting to its date of insertion. Paint analysis by Susan Buck demonstrates that despite its crudity it had been used to coat something with a paint that included hand-ground Prussian blue pigments, making it the earliest recorded use in America.See report in files, Department of Architectural Research, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.

The ashram was shifted to Gendaria in Dhaka in 1318 B.S. Sri Gouranga Anath Niketan was founded there on the 26th Agrahayana 1318 B.S. The purpose behind it is to serve the distressed, the grieved, the sick and the poor. There was a disciple of named \\"Saruram Kalita\\" purchased a plot of 80 bighas at \\"Kumarveti Chapri village\\" of \\"Kokilamukh\\", Jorhat in Sibsagar district after taking money from Nigamananda.

Nigamananda himself founded the \\"asan\\" (seat) of Brahama at \\"Kokilamukh\\" near Jorhat on the occasion of Akshay Tritiya on 7th Baisakh 1319 B.S. and named it Shanti Ashram. Seven self-denying swami disciples (Chidananda, Premananda, Swarupananda, Yogananda, Suddhananda, Bodhananda and Saradananda) were initiated in asceticism by Nigamananda. He named this ashram as \\"Saraswat Math\\". It has been called \\"Assam Bangiya Saraswat Math\\" since 1325 B.S. Being an ascetic relating to the title of \\"Saraswati\\" (tradition name) under the Sringeri Math Nigamananda gives the name to his Math as \\"Saraswata Matha\\".

It was enlarged in the 19th and 20th centuries when it was a private house and then a hotel. It is a Grade II* listed building. History The oldest part of the house was built as an inn for pilgrims attending the chapel of St Mary which was built by the monks of Cleeve Abbey in the mid-15th century. The chapel was built to replace one which had fallen into the sea, however the later version no longer exists. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries the house was leased by Henry VIII to Anthony Busted however this was revoked and the estate given to Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex for his services to the king. In the early 17th century the property was owned by the Stewkley family who used it as a family home until 1723. It was then purchased by Sir James Langham, 7th Baronet. In the early 19th century woods were planted on the estate, when the house was extended following designs by Richard Carver. In World War I the house was occupied by the Lysaght family who added the current main entrance and a ballroom, which is now used as the dining room. The house used to be surrounded by a landscape park, however most of this had been built on by the 1970s, including the development of a holiday park. In the 1980s it was being used as the Chapel Cleeve Manor Hotel. Present day In 1998 the house was bought for ¬£360,000 by a couple who intended to restore it with friends. Part- restoration of some areas was completed in 2002. After having parted ways, the remaining owner, Jeannie Wilkins, unable to afford further restoration works and upkeep, placed the 17-bedroom house, with of land, up for sale with a price of ¬£1,695,000 however it is estimated it would take at least ¬£500,000 to make it habitable. In 2012, after having been on the market unsold for over a year, the manor was used in an episode of the Channel 4 television series Country House Rescue. Strategies were discussed and tested, with the house used as a location for ghost hunting tours and special excursions were run by the West Somerset Railway to the building to help raise funds to assist the current owner to continue restoration works and to reside in the manor. In June 2015 the manor remained on the market with approximately ¬£500,000 of renovation work needed, although some restoration has been undertaken by students from Somerset College. , the Manor was still on the market for ¬£1,475,000.

He was married three times, including to Thelma Todd and Gloria Vanderbilt. He was a cousin of Albert R. Broccoli and gave him his well-known nickname \\"Cubby\\".  Personal life  DiCicco married Thelma Todd in 1932. The couple had a particularly unstable marriage, and they frequently erupted in drunken brawls, one of which resulted in a broken nose for DiCicco and an emergency appendectomy for Todd. They divorced in 1934. Todd died a year later from what was ruled to be accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. In 1941, DiCicco married Gloria Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt, who was only 17, had moved to Hollywood that same year. DiCicco was allegedly a temperamental and abusive husband who called Vanderbilt \\"Fatsy Roo\\" and regularly beat her. Vanderbilt later said, \\"He would take my head and bang it against the wall. I had black eyes.\\" They divorced in 1945. In 1953, DiCicco married actress Mary Jo Tarola (born February 27, 1928), also known by her stage name, Linda Douglas. The marriage lasted seven years before ending in divorce in 1960. DiCicco died in 1978 after a long bout with cancer.  Ted Healy incident  DiCicco is alleged to have been involved in an altercation with comedian Ted Healy just before the latter's death in 1937. A source alleged that actor Wallace Beery, producer Albert R. Broccoli and DiCicco beat Healy so badly that he fell into a coma and died. While there is no documentation in contemporaneous news reports that either Beery or DiCicco was present, Broccoli admitted that he was indeed involved in a fist fight with Healy at the Trocadero. He later modified his story, stating that a heavily intoxicated Healy had picked a fight with him, the two had briefly scuffled, then shook hands and parted ways. In other reports, Broccoli admitted to pushing Healy, but not striking him. There is disagreement over whether Healy died as a result of the brawl or due to his well-known alcoholism. Because of the authorities' lack of interest in investigating Healy's death, an autopsy was not performed until after Healy's corpse had been embalmed, rendering the examiner's note that Healy's organs were \\"soaked in alcohol\\" and useless in determining a cause of death. Following the autopsy, the Los Angeles county coroner reported that Healy died of acute toxic nephritis secondary to acute and chronic alcoholism. Police closed their investigation, as there was no indication in the report that his death was caused by physical assault.

The same month, it was revealed that the season will feature crossover episodes connecting with the upcoming spin-off series Once Upon a Time in Wonderland. In August 2013, it was announced that the season would be split into two parts, with the first eleven episodes premiering from September 29 to December 2013, while the second half would broadcast from March 9 to May 2014. The first eleven episodes were set primarily in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis spoke about the setting of the third season stating, \\"Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It‚Äôs really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland is going to have a profound effect on each of the characters. It‚Äôs really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it‚Äôs like for Emma to [be with] her parents. Neverland is really a place where we can sit down and think about that.\\" The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more \\"complicated\\" version of the character, with Kitsis saying, \\"We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!\\" In a further interview, Horowitz stated, \\"Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil.\\" At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours. Casting The primary characters of the third season.

In May 2013, it was revealed that season two regular Meghan Ory (Red Riding Hood/Ruby) would be departing the show to star in CBS's upcoming sci-fi drama Intelligence.

Promotion On September 12, 2013, ABC released the original cast promotional photos for the season. However, due to fan backlash, the photos were removed. Instead, new photos were promoted via social networking outlets with the tag-line '#SaveHenry'. The second half of the season used the tag- line \\"#WickedIsComing\\" for promotion pre-release and \\"#WickedVsEvil\\" during its run from March ‚Äì May 2014. Filming Set in Neverland, filming of the first half of season three was shot in a versatile set inside a Vancouver soundstage, re-dressed to represent up to twelve different tropical locales, including the camps of Peter Pan, Mr. Gold and the other residents of Storybrooke. The expensive set took a month to construct and was inspired by both Disney's animated Peter Pan movie and the Ewok village from Return of the Jedi. Foliage wrangler Sarah McCulloch spoke of the set-up saying, \\"It took us five days to assemble all the plants. We have 200 real plants that have to be watered and pruned every day and heated at night, 30 actual tree stumps and 450 fake branches\\" to which silk leaves were added. The Storybrooke scenes were again shot in Steveston, British Columbia, Canada.

During this period many villages were burned down by Col. John Winslow.  Historical Context  Before the deportation in 1755 there were many hamlets of Acadian families living in Nova Scotia. These hamlets were scattered throughout the country side. The villages were typically named after the head of the family.  Village Trahan  One such village was named after the family Trahan. This village was located to the south of Windsor, Nova Scotia. John Duncanson wrote two books in which he mentioned the Trahan family. On page six he lists several Pisiquid villages, their location and deputies. Village Trahan is one of these villages. The present location is at 1754 is St. Croix. Another book by Duncanson is Newport Nova Scotia. This book mentions village Trahan through a reference to the journal of Colonel John Winslow. Winslow wrote that in 1756 village Trahan was burned at the location St. Croix. John Mack Faragher wrote A Great and Noble Scheme. His book mentions Guillaume Trahan three times in his book but for just a few lines at a time. The greatest piece of information discovered from his book is that Guillaume arrived in Port Royal as one of the skilled tradesmen. Faragher writes that he is a steel smith. Later in his book he also writes that Guillaume was a syndic of Port Royal. Faragher also provides the information of when Guillaume arrived in Port Royal on the Saint-Jehan and who accompanied him. Sally Ross and Alphonse Deveau wrote the book The Acadians of Nova Scotia Past and Present. Their book contains less information than the other books already mentioned. There are two spots in the book where they make mention of Trahan for only a few lines. They make mention again of Guillaume leaving La Rochelle on April 1, 1636. John G. Reid, Maurice Basque, Elizabeth Mancke, Barrey Moody, Geoffrey Plank, and William Wicken write The ‚ÄòConquest‚Äô of Acadia, 1710 Imperial, Colonial, and Aboriginal Constructions. The only mention is a brief sentence where it says Guillaume was a syndic. It also makes mention in the same sentence that Jacob Bourgeois marries the daughter of Guillaume, Jeanne. There is also an article in the Hants Journal by John V. Duncanson. This article contains a map of the village Trahan as being under Fort Edward.

The Late Shows on teeshirts History The programme started as a one-night event with 14 cultural venues taking part including Discovery Museum, Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art and the Laing Art Gallery. All the venues stayed open late and put on free events and exhibitions, which aimed to entice a new, younger audience through their doors. From the outset many different agencies came together to open their doors and this has continued. In mid-May 2013, more than 50 attractions feature in what an arts site for the region describes as \\"The North East‚Äôs legendary culture crawl, The Late Shows\\". An Arts Council of England case study demonstrates its impact. That report gives headline information thus \\"In 2009, 54 events held over two nights across the 29 venues taking part attracted 15,116 visitors. This involved nine commissions, 126 artists and four education sessions. The total audience, including print, broadcast and online was 701,800.

Family Born in Cheam, Surrey to William Aherne (b. 1841) and Emma Paterson (b. 1842), de Lacy Aherne came from a family of devout Plymouth Brethren, a faith that he ceased to share in early adulthood. He married Annie Louise Thomas (1872 ‚Äì 1942), daughter of William Thomas (1841 - 1901) and Mary Louise Wright (1847 - 1912) in 1898 and they had the following children: *Patrick de Lacy Aherne (1901 - 1970) a film actor and a member of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. *William Brian de Lacy Aherne (1902 - 1986) *Elana Louise de Lacy Aherne (1904 - 1980) When he died on 4 December 1945 he was living at 25 Ladbrooke Road, London. Career In 1886 or 1887 he took a job as an architect's apprentice in Birmingham, where he worked for the King's Norton and Northfield Sanitary Authority. His earliest recorded private commissions were in the King's Norton area and date from 1889, and in 1890 he was elected to the Birmingham Architectural Association. In 1898 de Lacy Aherne was commissioned to build a series of houses by his father-in-law, whose local contacts in the Moseley area were helpful to the rising young architect, whose work quickly became fashionable among the rapidly growing and wealthy professional middle class of the area. From 1903 onwards he designed a large number of speculative houses in high-status Moseley roads such as Russell Road, Salisbury Road, Amesbury Road, Reddings Road and Oxford Road, financed either himself or in conjunction with local building firms. Several of these houses, including 9 St Agnes Road and 110 and 112 Oxford Road are now listed buildings. He was probably also the architect of Blackhill, the home of Birmingham Repertory Theatre founder Barry Jackson in the Malvern Hills.

The church was once part of a Benedictine nunnery located at Schwarzrheindorf, now part of Bonn. The \\"double church\\" has an upper church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and a lower church dedicated to Pope Clement I. The church is famous for its fine 12th-century frescos. History The church was probably built as a private chapel for Arnold of Wied, provost of Limburg Cathedral, Cologne Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht. Adjacent to the church, archaeological finds indicate that the chapel was once part of a castle belonging to the Wied family. In 1151 the Doppelkirche in Schwarzrheindorf was dedicated in the presence of King Conrad III of Germany. In the same year Arnold became archbishop of Cologne, a powerful position in that time. After Arnold's death in 1156 his sister Hadwig of Wied turned the buildings into a monastery for Benedictine nuns. Hadwig was already abbess of Gerresheim and Essen Abbey and she now also became head of the Schwarzrheindorf congregation. Two of her sisters joined as well. Later, the monastery became a stift, a collegial body for female canons of noble origin. The upper gallery of the Doppelkirche was accessible only to the noble members of the religious community, where they were able to attend Holy Mass, separated from the commoners in the church below. In 1803 the stift was dissolved and the church was used for secular purposes until in 1868 it became a parish church. Art historical significance The Doppelkirche Schwarzrheindorf is a well-preserved example of a double church from the High Middle Ages. The church has recently been plastered white but it is believed that this is what it looked like in the 12th century. It was originally conceived as a ZentralbauCf. Zentralbau on German wikipedia. (central structure without a nave), following the example of the Palatine Chapel in Aachen. The church has a tall crossing tower and a dwarf gallery that not only encircles the entire apse but also both transepts. The dwarf gallery is accessible via an external staircase. The Romanesque capitals of the gallery are closely related to the carved capitals seen at the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht, where Arnold of Wied had initiated an extensive building campaign during his provostship.The similarity between the carved capitals in both churches (as well as the Wartburg in Eisenach) was noted first by A.H. Diepen in 1931. According to Dutch art historian Elizabeth den Hartog both the carving and painting workshops were probably based in Maastricht (Den Hartog, pages 14, 101, 117, 119, 327). The 12th-century frescos are largely original. In 1863 they were rediscovered underneath a layer of white plaster that had covered them for several decades. Both the painted upper chapel and the lower chapel are of great art historical significance. The subject matter for the frescos was derived from the teachings of contemporary theologians like Rupert of Deutz and Otto of Freising. In the upper chapel Arnold and Hadwig of Wied are painted below a Majestas Domini, stretching out on the floor as a token of humility.

Background Holyfield's previous fight was a tough victory over journeyman fighter Bert Cooper, who was a last- minute replacement for Francesco Damiani, who himself was a replacement for Mike Tyson, after Damiani determined that he could not compete due to a foot injury. Cooper nearly managed to dethrone Holyfield of his title in the third round when he was able to deliver the first knockdown of Holyfield's professional career. Holyfield, however, was able to rebound from the knockdown to earn the victory via 7th round technical knockout. After his defeat of Cooper, Holyfield had hoped to next fight Tyson. The two men were originally scheduled to fight each other on November 8, 1991, before Tyson pulled out of the fight with a rib injury. Then on February 10, 1992, Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison, leading to the cancellation of the Holyfield‚ÄìTyson fight. On March 5, 1992, it was announced that Holyfield's next opponent would be 42-year-old former Heavyweight champion Larry Holmes.Match Is Made Official Holmes Getting Shot At Holyfield, Philadelphia Inquirer article, 1992-03-06, Retrieved on 2013-05-12 Holmes had twice retired, first after losing a rematch to Michael Spinks in 1986 for the IBF Heavyweight Championship, and then again after a loss to Mike Tyson in 1988 for the Undisputed Heavyweight Championship. In 1991, Holmes launched a successful comeback, winning five consecutive fights before facing undefeated Olympic Gold Medalist Ray Mercer in a match to determine the number one contender. Though Holmes came into the fight as an underdog, he was able to outpoint Mercer en route to a victory by unanimous decision.Holmes Defeats Mercer by Decision, N.Y. Times article, 1992-02-08, Retrieved on 2013-05-12 The fight The fight went the full 12 rounds with Evander Holyfield earning the victory via unanimous decision with two scores of 116‚Äì112 and one score of 117‚Äì111. Holyfield was able to control most of the fight as Holmes took a more defensive approach. Holmes' best offensive showing came in round 2 when he was able to hit Holyfield with a combination of uppercuts and hooks in the second minute of the round. Holmes was also able to open a cut above Holyfield's right eye after catching him with an elbow following a missed right hand. Nevertheless, Holyfield was the aggressor for the entire duration of the fight with Holmes spending most of the fight seemingly trying to avoid trading punches with Holyfield. Ultimately, neither man was able gain a knockdown throughout the relatively uneventful fight.Boring, Not Boxing, Sports Illustrated article, 1992-06-29, Retrieved on 2013-05-12 In what was surely not intended as a reflection on the evening's proceedings, Holmes vomited as the final bell rang. Aftermath Holyfield would next face arguably his toughest opponent, the undefeated Riddick Bowe. In what was named The Ring magazine's Fight of the Year, Riddick Bowe was able to defeat Holyfield by a close unanimous decision to become the new Undisputed Heavyweight Champion. Though it was not known if Holmes would continue to fight after his loss to Holyfield, he ultimately decided to continue his comeback, racking up seven consecutive victories after the Holyfield defeat to earn another chance at a major heavyweight title, this time facing Oliver McCall for the WBC Heavyweight Championship on April 8, 1995. Though he was again able to go the full 12 rounds, he was unable to pick up the victory, instead losing to McCall by another unanimous decision.

In the 20th century they will migrate to Africa (Asmara of Eritrea, Belgian Congo, Burundi, etc.), Jerusalem, Cyprus, the United States, Australia and other places.Cangelaris History 2011, p.56, 66-68, 177, 179, 189, 247-248, 252-253, 269, 285, 294-295, 296, 306-309, 331, 341Cangelaris Migrations 1991, p.110-118  Family branches  Founder of the family in Cephalonia and head of a long tradition of clergymen in the family is reported Protopapa Georgio Cangelari.Cangelaris History 2011, p.54-55, 347, 454 In the service of the Most Serene Republic of Venice, members of the family will be appointed during the 16th century military commanders in the region of Erisso and will distinguish themselves in the defense of Cephalonia and in spying activities at the then Ottoman-ruled neighboring regions (Lefkada, Central Greece, Peloponnese). They will also participate and distinguish in military operations of the time (and at sea, as privateers), while during the War of Crete (1645-1669) many will fall in action or will be enslaved. Apart from their military and ecclesiastical duties, members will be elected ambassadors of the Community, or be appointed notaries, elders, superintendents or constables, as well as teachers and medical doctors. By the mid-17th to 18th centuries family branches will be created with the following new surnames: Alissandrato, Vangelato (or Evangelato), Valianato, Velissarato, Galiazzato (or Galiatsato), Giacomato, Giannato, Giorgato, Danato, Diacato, Zamani, Zeppato (or Zepato), Teodosato, Todorato, Livierato, Liosato, Lurando, Marango, Marcato, Matiato, Batistato, Paluchi, Papadimitrato, Papastatato, Pavlato, Prassa, Rissiano, Sara, Stamatato, Stamatelato, Stafieri, Tacugni, Zuganato and Psaro, many of whom are to be found to date on the island and elsewhere. It has to be clarified that the affinity of those who bear surnames with the ending \\"-ato\\" can only be proved after a genealogical research, since such surnames may derive from more than one original families. Among the co- fraternal family churches are included two of the most important in the region of Erisso, those of Virgin Mary at Cugiana and of St. Stephen at the village of Vari.Cangelaris History

The series is based on the Argentine crime drama Mujeres Asesinas, which was adapted into an American setting by writer Hannah Shakespeare. Shakespeare also serves as an executive producer alongside Sof√≠a Vergara, Ben Silverman, Luis Balaguer, and Martin Campbell for Pol-Ka Productions, Silverman's Electus Productions, Vergara and Balaguer's Latin World Entertainment, and ABC Studios. The series stars Tricia Helfer. The pilot episode was directed by Lawrence Trilling. On May 9, 2014, ABC canceled Killer Women after only one season. Premise The series follows the life of Molly Parker, a former beauty queen and daughter of a sheriff who is recently separated from her abusive State Senator husband. She rises to the top ranks of one of the most elite and male-dominated law enforcement establishments, the Texas Rangers. The perpetrators of the episodic crimes she solves are all female. Cast and characters Main cast *Tricia Helfer as Molly Parker, a Texas Ranger *Marc Blucas as Dan Winston, a DEA agent and Molly's love interest *Alex Fernandez as Luis Zea, Molly's boss *Michael Trucco as Billy Parker, Molly's brother *Marta Milans as Becca Parker, Billy's wife Guest stars *Nadine Velazquez as Martina Alvarez *Beth Riesgraf as Jennifer Jennings *Melora Hardin as Nan Reed *Jeffrey Nordling as Jake Colton *Vincent Fuentes as Paco La Mosca *Paul Howard Smith as Sherriff Lloyd Watkins *Aisha Hinds as FBI Agent Linda Clark *Peyton McDavitt as Andrea Corbett *Paola Turbay as Carmen Garza *Alexandra Pomales as Hailee Parker *Michael Shamus Wiles as Colt Ritter *Arlin Alcala as Nurse Sanchez Episodes Critical response The series premiere was panned by critic Tim Goodman, who wrote: \\"Killer Women wants to be styled as a kind of cheap, broadcast network knockoff of Quentin Tarantino or something, but ends up redefining 'hokey' in the process.\\" ABC initially placed an eight-episode order for Killer Women, but after low ratings for the first two episodes, especially in the 18‚Äì49 demographic (0.9 and 0.7), the first season run was shortened to six episodes. Episode 7 was aired on February 18 as series finale instead of episode 6, because it provided a better ending with the granting of Molly's divorce. As a result, ABC moved up the premiere of the rookie drama Mind Games from March 11 to February 25.

The episode was written by executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Michelle MacLaren. It aired on . The episode is centered on the wedding of Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark in King's Landing, Gendry's arrival at Dragonstone and Daenerys's meeting with the mercenary company of the Second Sons before the walls of Yunkai. Plot In the Riverlands Arya tries to kill the Hound while he is sleeping, but he is revealed to be awake, and thwarts her attempt on his life. They depart their camp and head for the Twins, where the Hound intends to ransom Arya to Robb. In King's Landing Tyrion visits Sansa to ease her apprehension at the prospect of being his wife. In the Sept of Baelor, Cersei threatens Margaery with the story of House Reyne, former Lannister vassals whom Tywin exterminated when they rebelled against him. After arriving at the Sept, Sansa is walked down the aisle by Joffrey. At their wedding feast, Tyrion gets drunk. Joffrey, after threatening to rape Sansa, calls for Sansa to be stripped for the traditional bedding ceremony, but his plan is thwarted when Tyrion threatens to castrate an outraged Joffrey. Tywin defuses the situation. Tyrion leaves the feast with Sansa, and he tells Sansa he will not share her bed until she wants him to. At Dragonstone Melisandre returns to Dragonstone with Gendry and takes him to see Stannis, who recognizes Gendry as one of Robert's bastards. When Gendry is taken to his chamber, Stannis and Melisandre discuss what they intend to do with him. In the dungeons, Davos continues to learn to read. Stannis visits him to discuss Melisandre's plan to sacrifice Gendry. Davos objects to the plan, but Stannis remains resolved. He then makes Davos swear to never raise his hand to Melisandre again, and frees him. Melisandre visits Gendry and seduces him, tying him to a bed in the process. She lays three leeches on him to draw his royal blood. Stannis ritually burns the leeches, speaking the names of the usurpers to his throne: Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy, and Joffrey Baratheon. At Yunkai Jorah tells Daenerys that Yunkai has employed a mercenary group called the Second Sons. Daenerys meets with Mero, his co-captain Prendahl na Ghezn, and his lieutenant Daario Naharis. She attempts to bribe Mero to fight for her, and gives him two days to make a decision. Back at camp, Mero decides to kill Daenerys; Daario is randomly selected to commit the assassination. After nightfall, Daario enters Daenerys' camp, disguised as an Unsullied. He enters her tent and revealed he killed Mero and Prendahl instead, admitting that he is smitten by Daenerys. She demands his loyalty and he accepts. Beyond the Wall Sam and Gilly stop at an abandoned hut for the night while travelling to the Wall. When they hear a murder of crows cawing nearby, Sam leaves the hut to investigate. He is attacked by a White Walker intent on taking Gilly's son, but Sam stabs it with his dragonglass dagger, causing the Walker to disintegrate. Production Writing The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. \\"Second Sons\\" was written by the show creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on material from George R. R. Martin's novel A Storm of Swords. The episode adapts parts of the book's chapters 19, 29, 37, 43, 47 and 48 (Samwell I, Sansa III, Davos IV, Daenerys IV, Samwell III and Arya IX). Casting The episode introduced the mercenary captains in service of Yunkai: Mark Killeen was cast as Mero (known as the Titan's Bastard), Ed Skrein the recurring role of Daario Naharis, and Ramon Tikaram the part of Prendahl na Ghezn. Tikaram is mistakenly credited as \\"Ramon Tikrum\\" in the closing credits. Filming locations Most of the scenes of the episode were shot in the Belfast studios of The Paint Hall, including the wedding of Tyrion and Sansa that was filmed at the huge semicircular set of the Great Sept of Baelor in mid September 2012. For this scene, a few hundred extras were recruited. Reception Ratings The episode received 5.1 million viewers, an increase from the previous week, with an 18-49 demographic of 2.6. In the United Kingdom, the episode was seen by 0.907 million viewers on Sky Atlantic, being the channel's highest-rated broadcast that week. Critical reception \\"Second Sons\\" received critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 20 reviews of the episode and judged 100% of them to be positive with an average score of 8 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\" 'Second Sons' shines through efficient storytelling -- and a comparatively low number of storylines to keep track of this week.\\" Writing for IGN, Matt Fowler rated the episode a 9.0/10, and wrote \\"This week's well-crafted and wonderfully acted Game of Thrones gave us a cold wedding, a hot bath and a blood-letting.\\" He especially praised the scenes between Sansa and Tyrion and between Ser Davos and Stannis. David Sims and Emily VanDerWerff, both writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode \\"B\\" ratings. Sims was frustrated by the episode's meandering pace, but praised the end of the episode, with Sam killing the white walker, as \\"the most crucial, fascinating, electric moment of the night\\". VanDerWerff praised the use of nudity in the episode, writing \\"...I actually think Game Of Thrones has gotten quite a bit better at utilizing nudity and sex in the midst of everything else as a method of telling its story. It‚Äôs come a long way from the 'sexposition' days of season one, when it sometimes seemed like the series would toss some breasts into the background of a scene just in case we got bored of hearing somebody talk at length.\\" Accolades Due to his nomination, Peter Dinklage submitted this episode for consideration for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards.

He was slain in 1480, along with all his priests, by the Ottoman force that invaded Otranto. He is among the 813 martyrs of Otranto canonized by Pope Francis in 2013. Life Stefano Argercolo de Pendinellis was born in 1403 in Galatina and studied in Nard√≤, where he became bishop on 8 February 1436, shortly after the death of his uncle, a Franciscan friar. In 1451, he was appointed archbishop of Otranto. He assumed the archbishopric on 16 June. Martyrdom On 28 July 1480 an Ottoman force commanded by Gedik Ahmed Pasha, consisting of 90 galleys, 40 galiots and other ships carrying a total of around 150 crew and 18,000 troops, landed beneath the walls of Otranto.De Vargas, Ivan. \\"The 800 Martyrs of Otranto\\", Zenit, May 13, 2013 The city strongly resisted the Ottoman assaults, but the garrison was unable to resist the bombardment for long. The garrison and all the townsfolk thus abandoned the main part of the city on 29 July, retreating into the citadel while the Ottomans began bombarding the neighboring houses. When Gedik Ahmed asked the defenders to surrender, they refused, and so the Ottoman artillery resumed the bombardment. On 12 August, after a 15-day siege, the citadel was captured. In the massacre which followed, all men over 15 years old were killed and all the women and children were enslaved. According to some historical accounts, a total of 12,000 were killed and 5,000 enslaved, including victims from the territories of the Salentine peninsula around the city. Some survivors and the city's clergy took refuge in the cathedral to pray with the elderly Archbishop Pendinelli. Gedik Ahmed ordered them to convert to Islam, but received a flat refusal and so broke into the cathedral with his men and killed all those inside. This included Pendinelli, who was cut down before the altar. Accounts of means of his martyrdom differ. One account says that he was skewered and cut to pieces with scimitars before having his head cut off, put on a pike and carried around the city. Another account, given by Antonio de Ferrariis in his work De situ Japigiae, states that the archbishop, \\"after having heartened the population the previous day by the sacrament of the Eucharist, climbed from the crypt of the cathedral into the choir, and there, a martyr of the faith in Christ and dressed in ecclesiastical vestments, was murdered on his cathedra by the Turks, when they broke into the church.\\" Yet another source claims that he was sawn in half with a wooden saw. Veneration A portrait of Pendinelli hangs in the Church of the Assumption, Mother of the Church (Chiesa dell'Assunta della Chiesa Matrice) in his hometown of Galatina. A canonical process for the martyrs of Otranto began in 1539 and ended on 14 December 1771, when Pope Clement XIV beatified the 800 killed on the Colle della Minerva and authorised their cult. At the request of the archdiocese of Otranto, the process was resumed and confirmed in full the previous process. On 6 July 2007, Pope Benedict XVI issued a decree recognising that the martyrs were killed \\"out of hatred for their faith.\\" A miracle was confirmed in 2012. The announcement of the canonization was made on 11 February 2013 by Pope Benedict XVI in the consistory in which Benedict also announced his intention to resign the papacy. Pendinelli was canonized with the other 812 martyrs of the Ottoman invasion by Pope Francis on 12 May 2013.

It probably lay along the important road from Complutum to Gaul.Garc√≠a Moreno 1993, 186. Several of its monks became bishops of Toledo during the seventh century. Agali was one of the earliest sites of regular monasticism‚Äî\\"monastic communities following received rules\\"‚Äîin central, southern or western Spain, although such communities did exist prior to the late sixth century on the Mediterranean coast and in the northeast.Collins 2004, 153. In the rest of Spain there was \\"an older tradition of individual or family asceticism, represented by voluntary celibacy and the setting up of private monastic households\\". Regular monasticism seems to have been introduced by exiles from Africa, fleeing the Byzantine government's enforced resolution of the Three Chapters controversy and the Berber raids precipitated by Byzantine military weakness. Agali may have been founded by African expatriates. Agali's second abbot, Helladius, became bishop of Toledo in 615, and was succeeded as abbot by Justus, a monk of Agali from childhood.Collins 2004, 167‚Äì68. In 633, Helladius returned to Agali to die. During his final days, he consecrated as a deacon the monk Ildefonsus, who subsequently became abbot and finally bishop in 657. Helladius was succeeded as bishop by Justus, who was succeeded as abbot by Richila. While bishop, Justus sent a now lost treatise to Richila, but its contents are unknown. In 636, Justus was succeeded by Eugenius II, another monk of Agali and student of Helladius, who had followed his teacher to Toledo in 615. Notes Sources *Collins, Roger. Visigothic Spain, 409‚Äì711.

Since photography was first introduced to the Cape Colony through the colonising powers, photography has variously been used as a weapon of colonial control, a legitimating device for the apartheid regime, and, in its latest incarnation, a mechanism for the creation of a new South African identity in the age of democracy, freedom and equality. Early photography Photography arrived in South Africa with the British and Dutch colonists in the 19th Century. Early ethnographic photography, conducted primarily by anthropologists and missionaries, documented the native populations. The collections from this time are often critiqued as being exploitative projects of colonial domination, essentialising the native Khoi khoi and San populations of the Cape in order to legitimate ideologies of racial hierarchies that underpinned the colonial endeavour. Resistance photography Photographers played a pivotal role, during apartheid, of documenting and communicating the liberation struggle to the outside world. The term resistance photography arose to describe work that challenged the beliefs, policies or actions of the apartheid government. Apartheid, a violent system of harshly enforced racial segregation that characterised South African society from 1948‚Äì1994, was legitimated by a historically received discourse based on religious, racial, ethnic and social grounds. Visual culture, as popular medium of expression, was positioned either to reinforce or to subvert such discourses. Resistance photography came to disrupt this consensually validated rhetorical construction, by presenting the humanity of non-white racial groups in ways that contravene the racist ideologies of the apartheid state. Contemporary photography Photography in contemporary South Africa has developed into a lively and burgeoning cultural movement, which, since 1994, has exploded into a democratised and accessible form of artistic expression. The weight of its apartheid past no doubt heavily influences its present, and the legacy of resistance photography has transformed into an abiding focus on the ongoing social issues faced by the new South Africa. Popular themes include HIV/Aids, racism and social inequality, the democratic transition, and persistent injustices of post-apartheid South Africa. Graeme Williams‚Äô exhibition entitled The Edge of Town is paradigmatic of this new movement, exploring the liminal spaces of informal settlements on the peri- urban fringes of contemporary metropolises such as Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban. Through capturing these life-spaces, work such as Williams' personalises issues that too often become dehumanised. Anthropologist Johannes Fabian suggests that in the African context, such pop cultural expressions represent ‚Äòmoments of freedoms‚Äô, allowing for the conceptualisation and cultivation of alternative modes of being, that liberate the individual, albeit in fleeting, contestatory and conflictual spaces. Much South African photography such as Williams‚Äô work, embodies Fabian's notion of ‚Äòmoments of freedom‚Äô, depicting lives both limited, but not completely contained by the harsh realities of life. Moreover, South Africa's unique status as an African nation with incredible wealth and incredible poverty provides fertile ground for challenging discourses of afro-pessimism and neo-colonialist attitudes towards Africa. Exhibitions such as Swedish photographer Jens Assur's Africa is a Great Country, seek to dismantle essentialist notions of Africa as a poverty-stricken, war-torn continent, by drawing on impulses of the African Renaissance, to project images of everyday life, of a continent of real and normal people, whose lives are as rich and as varied as anyone's. As an influential voice on the continent, the artistic output of South Africa has a key role in forging new ways of imagining Africa that complicate received notions of a ‚Äòstruggling‚Äô continent. Paul Weinberg's photo-essay Durban: Portrait of an African City exemplifies this new current of work that refuses to constrain engagement with African art to the familiar tropes of poverty and violence, depicting instead the dynamism and vivacity of life on the continent. Notable photographers Key institutions The South African Centre for Photography is a Cape Town-based not-for-profit organisation that endeavours to promote a broader understanding of photography across the African continent through regular and accessible exhibitions and programs. Professional photographers of Southern Africa is a representative body for practising photographers and other practitioners affiliated to the photography industry in South Africa that seeks to, amongst other aims, recognise and promote excellence in the field of Southern African photography. The officially recognised body representing photographers in Southern Africa is the Photographic Society of South Africa. A not-for-profit organisation, it seeks to promote interest in, and standards of photography in South Africa. Amongst its official functions is the task of monitoring and censoring images deemed unfit for public viewing. The Annual General Meeting of the Society involves a Photographic Congress, giving exposure to photographers. There is a rich array of educational and training opportunities for South African photographers. The Vega Photography School, located in Pretoria, Gauteng, offers the highest level photographic instruction in the country. The Stellenbosch Academy of Design and Photography is another of the nation's premier tertiary visual communication institutes, offering undergraduate and post-graduate courses, located in Stellenbosch, Western Cape. The College of Digital Photography, with campuses in Pretoria, Fourways, Cape Town and Saxonwold, offers specialised programs in photography and videography, designed for digital cameras. South African photographers nationwide also run their business through various means such as Tapsnapp which is one the most prominent platforms designed to connect with South African consumers and helps photographers with their livelihood.

The building continues its original function of housing county offices and is an active courthouse. History Shiawassee County was established in 1822 by Lewis Cass, governor of Michigan Territory. Due to its low population, it was not until 1837 that a county government was organized. In 1839, the Shiawassee County Seat Company donated a piece of land to the county which was designated as a public square. Temporary facilities held county offices on the square until the construction of a brick courthouse in 1851. A new courthouse, designed by Claire Allen, was built from 1903 through 1904 at the square, with the cornerstone laid on May 4, 1904. The project cost $75,000. The courthouse was designated a Michigan State Historic Site on November 14, 1974, and an informational marker was erected on December 31, 1974. The building was renovated in 1981. On November 12, 1982, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Further renovation work took place from 2009 through 2010, with the primary goal of increasing security. Begun in September 2009, the $424,000 project reduced the number of entrances and added metal detectors and an elevator. The work was cognizant of the building's history, keeping renovations in line with the structure's original appearance. The building continues to house most county offices and is still an active courthouse. Architecture The building is a three-story structure built of Bedford Limestone in the Classical Revival style. The front face is visually divided into five bays. The lower two levels have a rusticated facade. In the center of the front face is a projecting portico with a column-supported pediment. The structure has a hipped roof, on top of which is an elaborately decorated three-tiered clock tower with a tile roof.

The Compact became effective in 1951 and provided for the creation of the Yellowstone River Compact Commission to administer the provisions of the Compact as between the states of Montana and Wyoming.  Montana v. Wyoming  In 2007, Montana motioned the Supreme Court of the United States for leave of Court to file a bill of complaint against Wyoming and North Dakota, claiming that Wyoming had violated the Yellowstone River Compact by permitting the citizens of Wyoming to employ more efficient irrigation systems, causing Montana to receive less run off water than the state had originally received. When the Compact was agreed to, irrigation was accomplished mostly by flooding crop fields. Around 65% of the water would be absorbed into the soil or evaporate, leaving 35% of the water to flow back into the source rivers and downstream. With more efficient irrigation systems such as sprinkling, 10% or less of the water flows downstream, effectively allowing Wyoming to utilize more water. The Supreme Court granted the motion for leave of Court and appointed Stanford University natural resources law professor Bradford H. Thompson, Jr. as Special Master to try the case and recommend a decision to the Court. Special Master Thompson concluded that because the Compact did not specify a fixed volume of water from the Yellowstone River or its tributaries that would be available to Montana, Wyoming's use of more efficient irrigation methods did not violate the Compact. In the opinion for Montana v. Wyoming filed May 2, 2011, the Supreme Court agreed, holding that Montana had failed to state a claim for breach of the Compact, and that Wyoming's more efficient irrigation systems do not violate the Compact.

She began playing varsity basketball in high school when she was an eighth grader and played for five years. She is notable for playing basketball while being completely covered showing no skin, except for her hands, and while wearing a hijab - a head-dress for Muslim women. Not only is she successful on the court, but she is also successful in the classroom, in which she is an honor student. She had a very successful high school career, scoring over 3000 points, breaking both male and female scoring records in Massachusetts. She graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in health and human performance/exercise science from the University of Memphis. She finished up her college basketball career at Indiana State University, where she is currently the graduate assistant with Indiana State's Women's Basketball team and is completing her master's degree in coaching. Early life and high school career Abdul- Qaadir was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on November 11, 1990, to Tariq and Alooah Abdul-Qaadir. Her brother Yusuf Abdul-Ali also had a successful basketball career where he played at Bentley College and helped lead his school to two NCAA Division II final four appearances. Abdul-Qaadir attended New Leadership Charter School. She began playing varsity basketball in the 8th grade at New Leadership Charter School, where she recently visited once again to speak to this years eighth grade. She not only played there but started as well. As a freshman in high school, she scored her 1,000th point, being the only freshman in Massachusetts history since Rebecca Lobo and Kelsey O'Keefe to do so. As a senior in High school, she scored 3,070, surpassing Lobo's previous record of 2,740 points. Lobo began her varsity career in the 7th grade whereas Abdul-Qaadir started in 8th grade, which gave Lobo an extra year and yet she still managed to surpass Lobo's scoring record. Abdul-Qaadir was named 2009 Massachusetts Gatorade Player of the Year as she averaged 42 points per game as a senior. In her final game in high school, Abdul-Qaadir scored 51 of her team's 56 points in a regional loss. She also graduated New Leadership Charter School as an honor student. From a young age, Abdul-Qaadir, Barakah, and Vanessa her cousins all knew she wanted basketball to be a part of her life. After first picking up a ball at the age of four at a local YMCA, her love for the game grew. Growing up in a practicing Muslim household, Abdul- Qaadir was to follow her religious beliefs as she grew older. She began wearing a hijab, a traditional head covering for Muslim women, and practiced modesty on the court by covering all skin except her hands. She became a standout at New Leadership Charter School in Springfield, Mass. where she excelled on the court and in the classroom. The school's valedictorian, Abdul- Qaadir set the Massachusetts state record for both boys and girls, with 3,070 points scored ‚Äì breaking Connecticut and WNBA star Rebecca Lobo's previous state record of 2,740. She was also named the state's 2009 Gatorade Player of the Year and a McDonald's All-American nominee. Her skills transitioned into a full ride scholarship to the University of Memphis where she played four years (2009‚Äì13) and graduated with magna cum laude with a degree in exercise science. During her freshman year at Memphis, she was invited to the White House for Ramadan feast and was acknowledged by President Barack Obama for being the first Muslim woman to play covered in collegiate basketball. In 2011, Abdul-Qaadir was awarded the United States Basketball Writers Association ‚ÄúMost Courageous‚Äù award at the NCAA Women's Final Four for being recognized as the first Muslim woman to play covered in NCAA history. Abdul- Qaadir battled through a torn ACL during her freshman season and wrapped up her time as a Tiger in 2013. Using her extra year of NCAA eligibility, she transferred to Indiana State where she led the Sycamores to a Missouri Valley Conference title on her way to becoming the league's Newcomer of the Year. She ranks 10th all-time in a single season for points scored (454), was also named First Team All-MVC, Second Team Scholar Athlete and earned a combined seven conference Player, Newcomer and Scholar Athlete of the Week awards. Her hopes were to continue playing professionally in Europe, but were quickly diminished when she was informed of the rule from the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) that prohibits head gear larger than five inches. Unwilling to stray in her beliefs, Abdul-Qaadir has stood up to the international rules, petitioning to the league for an exemption to the rule. Without any success, she has had to put her dreams of playing professionally aside as she works to now pave a way for other Muslim women in sports. She has started an online campaign called ‚ÄúMuslim Girls Hoop Too‚Äù to raise awareness for Muslim women in sports with emphasis on female basketball players. Through her campaign, Abdul-Qaadir was once again invited to the White House in March 2015 for the Muslim Leaders Meeting as one of 15 representatives that met with President Obama and his senior officials. That experience led her to an invitation to the 2015 White House Easter Egg Roll where she was able to raise awareness for physical activity under the First Lady's ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Move‚Äù campaign. After finishing her master's degree in May 2015 at Indiana State, Abdul-Qaadir looks to continue inspiring young Muslim women by starting her own non-profit organization under the name ‚ÄúMuslim Girls Hoop Too.‚Äù In its beginning phase, she hopes to use the organization to travel the world to empower young women to stay true to themselves while using physical activity and basketball as a platform. College Abdul-Qaadir signed with the University of Memphis after her senior season. Due to her name being hard to pronounce, the team called her by her nickname Qisi in order to make calling her name quicker and more effective. As a freshman, she tore her anterior cruciate ligament (a major ligament in the knee) in the preseason and had to be red-shirted for the 2009‚Äì2010 season. The following 2010‚Äì2011 season she played in 34 games and averaged 3.9 points per game and 1.3 rebounds per game. Her freshman season marked the first time in NCAA history that a player played in a hijab, which is a traditional Muslim headdress. In her 2011‚Äì2012 season, Abdul-Qaadir upped her scoring from 3.9 to 7.8 points per game and became the third Tiger point guard to record over 100 assists in a single season. She set a team record by making 26 consecutive free throws in the regular season. In the 2012‚Äì2013 season, she only played in 25 games, due to breaking her wrist early in the season. She averaged 10.6 points per game and 3.2 rebounds per game. She was very successful in class as well, being awarded numerous academic honors. Abdul-Qaadir graduated from the University of Memphis and used her final season of eligibility at Indiana State University in Terre Haute. She adopted the nickname, \\"Qisi\\" and continued her outstanding play with her new team, the Sycamores, being named Conference Outstanding Newcomer of the 2013-2014 season. In the 2014-2015 season, Abdul-Qaadir works as Graduate Assistant on the Women's Basketball staff.

The president spoke about how much of an inspiration Abdul-Qaadir was, due to her being an honor student as well as an athlete, and how she was not only an inspiration to Muslim girls but an inspiration to everyone in the world today. He also joked and said how he wanted to play her in a game of 1-on-1. In attendance were multiple ambassadors as well as the Defense Secretary and Attorney General.

The attainment gap between Bristnall and the other local schools closed during the late 1970s when all the local secondary schools became comprehensive schools. The school received Technology College status in 2005. In 2006, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council announced plans to merge Bristnall with nearby Langley High School. However, it was announced in 2007 that the school would be rebuilt on the site of Langley High School as part of the Building Schools for the Future scheme. Langley High School merged with nearby Warley High School to become Oldbury College of Sport (now Oldbury Academy). The school opened its Sixth Form Centre within the School at the start of the 2010 academic year to Post-16 Students. The school became an academy in December 2012 and was renamed Bristnall Hall Academy supported by the Academy Transformation Trust. In October 2019, the school announced plans to build an extension to the academy. In 2021, the number of students allowed to join the academy will increase from 190 to 210.

More than 250 Country Fire Service volunteers and four aerial water bombers were deployed to fight the fire. One house was destroyed, and the area burnt exceeded . It began at about 2:30p.m. on Thursday 9 May amid unseasonably warm weather when a private burn-off north of Cherryville became out of control and began to burn east into inaccessible country. Warm temperatures, high winds, and heavy fuel loads contributed to the spread of the fire. Firefighters were initially unable to fight the fire directly, due to the inaccessibility of the terrain. Firefighters eventually managed to contain the fire around 5p.m. on 11 May, assisted by a change in the weather which brought approximately 10mm of rain. The fire was notable in that it began over a week after the official fire-ban season ended. This prompted calls for the season to be extended into May; the Government announced on 12 May that a review of the policy would be conducted. However, concerns were raised that this would limit the ability of residents and the CFS to conduct fuel-reduction burns.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on April 30, 2013. The episode is written by George Schenck and Frank Cardea and directed by James Whitmore, Jr., and was seen by 18.29 million viewers. The story arc was initiated in January when secondary characters Eli David (Michael Nouri) and Jackie Vance (Paula Newsome) were killed off in a shooting at the end of \\"Shabbat Shalom\\". Subsequent episodes featured Ziva David and Leon Vance's efforts to find the killer, eventually revealed to be Eli's prot√©g√© Ilan Bodnar, and exact vengeance. In the closing scenes of the previous episode, \\"Berlin\\", Tony and Ziva are in a car crash instigated by Bodnar. \\"Revenge\\" focuses on the team's hunt for Bodnar against the wishes of Homeland Security, culminating in Vance and Ziva finally getting closure when the latter kills him in a physical fight to the death.  Plot  As the episode opens, Tony and Ziva are semi-conscious in the aftermath of the crash. Bodnar (Oded Fehr) approaches the vehicle and retrieves a parcel of illicit diamonds, despite efforts from a dazed Ziva to stop him. Later, in the ER, Ziva is anxious to resume the search for Bodnar, despite having sustained injuries and being instructed to halt all fieldwork for the time being. She and DiNozzo sneak out of the hospital and return to NCIS headquarters, questioning Abby about the details of the case. Despite Abby‚Äôs unwillingness to talk, they are able to deduce the location of the rest of the team. McGee and Gibbs are shown investigating Bodnar's former hideout and processing the body of a man (Billy House) who had apparently assisted Bodnar in exchange for diamonds in payment. They are unable to identify him through facial recognition and eventually learn that this is due to extensive plastic surgery the man underwent. Tony and McGee locate the surgeon and learn that the man was a South African mercenary named Clive Goddard (Branden Cook). Ziva begins to undergo intensive training, evidently in hopes of a confrontation with Bodnar, including forcing herself to practice boxing with an injured shoulder. Homeland Senior Division Chief Tom Morrow (Alan Dale) demands that Vance rein in Ziva's efforts and leave the case to Homeland Security. Vance is reluctant to accept this but mildly suggests to Ziva that she back down. Bodnar contacts Ziva at NCIS and insists that, while he was responsible for the deaths of Eli David and Jackie Vance, he did not kill the Iranian ambassador. McGee is able to pinpoint the area in the background of Bodnar's video as a park in New York and alerts Homeland. However, they quickly realize that the video was a ploy to throw them off and that the background was staged. Ziva, meanwhile, manages to figure out Bodnar's true location from a note attached to Goddard and confronts him on a ship about to depart. Bodnar insists that he will not be apprehended, and when Ziva refuses to shoot him unarmed, a fight ensues. The team, having become aware of Ziva's absence, rushes to the scene in time to see Bodnar fall to his death. In the closing scene, Ziva is taken to Vance's office, where she tells him that \\"it's over.\\"  Production  \\"Revenge\\" is written by George Schenck and Frank Cardea and directed by James Whitmore, Jr. The episode is the second part of a 4-episode act ending the 10th season. Originally the writers intended the first part \\"to end after the crash, with Ilan Bodnar taking the diamonds and driving away, [and] Ziva shooting after him\\", but during post production parts of the ending of \\"Berlin\\" was moved to the cold opening of \\"Revenge\\". The reason for this move was because the writers now felt the ending in \\"Berlin\\" would be a \\"much stronger cliffhanger on \\"Tiva\\", the mystery of Tony and Ziva‚Äôs fate\\". Another change was done with early drafts of the scrip when the fight between Ziva and Bodnar aboard the ship changed from day to night. Mark Harmon asked the writers \\"if [they] didn't think it would play better at night\\", and they agreed. In August 2012, Cote de Pablo, who portrays Ziva, admitted to missing aspects of her character that were more prevalent in earlier seasons. She elaborated, \\"I'm going into my eighth season so I do believe that much like me, Cote, who has gone through a whirlwind of changes in these past eight years...I think the character has also changed. She came with a little bit more of an edge, she trusted people less, she had a little bit more violence in her. Those are the things that I actually miss about the character. The character to me has gotten a little bit softer, perhaps more inclined to listen before acting out - and that's one of the things that I noticed. However, I don't know if it's an actual positive for me because I really like the old, old Ziva.\\" Before the episode aired, showrunner Gary Glasberg hinted that \\"Revenge\\" would delve into this somewhat, remarking, \\"it really gives Ziva fans an opportunity to see a strong, determined, relentless Ziva David that they haven't seen in a while.\\" Oded Fehr returned as ex-mossad deputy director Ilan Bodnar, making it his third appearance this season. Alan Dale also returned as Homeland Senior Division Chief Tom Morrow.  Reception  \\"Revenge\\" was seen by 18.29 million live viewers following its broadcast on April 30, 2013, with a 3.1/10 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Revenge\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night. The spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles drew second and was seen by 13.07 million viewers. Compared to the last episode \\"Berlin\\", \\"Revenge\\" was up in viewers and adults 18‚Äì49. Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.8/5 and stated that \\"Once again, the writers for NCIS have done a tremendous job. They kept us guessing all the way through. [...] All in all, this was a great episode. The final scene was just about as perfect as it gets. Ziva, battered and bruised, walking into Vance's office. Vance struggling with his warring emotions over his concern for her, and his need to know if Bodnar was dead.\\" Laurel Brown from Zap2it criticized the relatively mild nature of Tony and Ziva's injuries following the crash, believing that the damage should have been more severe. A reviewer from TV Overmind wrote, \\"I was a little saddened by Ziva‚Äôs actions throughout the episode. No matter how many steps she takes toward a happier life she always seems to be flung backwards whenever her family or past connections to Mossad resurface. Watching her punch her way through the pain of a dislocated shoulder in order to prove to herself that she was in control of her own body was such a desperate but pointless exercise...In general 'Revenge' was a good episode. The storyline was solid as usual and Cote De Pablo always delivers the goods when she is portraying her characters dramatic side. She manages to slide smoothly between vengeful agent and emotionally shattered daughter which leaves me in awe of her acting skills.\\" Michelle Calbert from BuddyTV included \\"Shiva\\" in her list of \\"The 10 Best Ziva Episodes\\" and said, \\"In this episode, Ziva and the rest of the team have had a fairly long while to deal with the deaths of both her father and Vance's wife. All of them want justice for the man behind the murders, but it's Ziva who wants revenge. Even after being injured in a car accident, Ziva doesn't let that [stop her] from going after Bodnar and ultimately ending his life by her own hand (though she may deny it in later episodes).\\" References Category:2013 American television episodes Category:NCIS (season 10) episodes ","title":"Revenge (NCIS)"},{"id":"39371061","title":"Athletics at the 2005 Summer Universiade ‚Äì Women's 3000 metres steeplechase"},{"id":"39371066","text":"John Trevor Key (10 July 1947 ‚Äì 6 December 1995) was a British photographer and designer, best known for his work for musical artists of the 1970s and 1980s.

It was an alternative to investing in the more productive Northrop automatic looms in the 1930s. It caused resentment, industrial action and failed to achieve any significant cost savings. Traditional weaving For one hundred years the weaving sheds of Lancashire had been equipped with cast iron constructed looms not dissimilar to the original Roberts loom, invented by Richard Roberts. They were driven by leather belts from line shafts. They were closely packed together in pairs with a narrow alley. One weaver was responsible for four looms; it was her duty to replace the weft in the shuttle when it ran out. The weft was on a pirn, so she stopped the loom, found the shuttle, removed it, and bent the shuttle peg containing the pirn towards her; removed the pirn and replaced it with a fresh one. She placed a loop of thread close to the inside of the eye and in an operation called kissing the shuttle, sucked it through. The shuttle was ready. It was placed back in the sley, and all loose threads cut off and removed. A final check and the loom was restarted. The loom operates at 220 picks per minute and the weaver is paid by the piece. She was adept at balancing her work keeping all the looms running, so only one would be stopped at one time. Labour costs were a significant proportion of the cost in producing cloth. Depression In the UK depression of the 1920s and the subsequent world depression, methods were sought to reduce the labour cost by reducing the number of weavers employed. This was controversial, as the weaver saw themselves as underpaid per piece and were being forced to underwork as production had exceeded demand. Before the war, the weaver had been paid 25% more than an unskilled engineering worker but in the late twenties the skilled weaver has paid less. However, for a woman it was a well paid job. The weavers were represented by the Amalgamated Weavers' Association. The more looms system was one management inspired solution to bring more looms into production using a reduced number of weavers overall. The Lancashire cotton industry had considered re-equipping with the Northrop automatic loom with automatic weft stop and shuttle replenishment. Experiments in 1932 showed that with Northrops a weaver could tenter 40 looms though 24 was more usual. This solution was rejected as the industry couldn't raise the capital needed to reinvest, and there were doubts whether the investment could be recouped. The mechanics of their contract were such that an underemployed weaver could not claim unemployment insurance, and unlike the spinners who had a strong union system they were not prepared to work to a rota of staggered employment and voluntary unemployment, so the insurance would cut in.  More looms weaving The more looms system was designed to substantially reduce labour costs in order to make the industry more competitive. It would take out some looms and reduce the workforce by thirty percent. The more looms system aimed at doubling the number of looms that a weaver would tenter while making modest changes to the conditions of working. One was to respace the looms using horizontal alleys at the end of each eight loom set making access easier. Another was to increase the size of the cop on each pirn to make refilling times longer. The speed of the loom was reduced to 180 picks per minute. The piece rates were to be adjusted so the weaver on more looms would be marginally better off. Experiments carried out in Burnley in 1929 showed a wage saving of 20% to 30% could be made which would reduce the overall cost of the cloth by 2% to 7%.  Implications in the weaving areas The unions' approach was confusing. They wanted to implement more looms, but were opposed to it as it didn't pay a man enough so his wife could stay at home. The employers' associations would not pay such a rate. The Burnley Employers Association attempted to introduce the system without union agreement in 1931. This resulted in the industrial disputes of 1931, when the Amalgamated Weavers' Association (AWA) organised a strike, which led to a country-wide lockout. The Nelson Weavers' Association, in which Independent Labour Party members were prominent, felt that the AWA was too keen to make concessions, and organised its own delegation. Led by Zeph Hutchinson, this met with Arthur Greenwood and ILP Members of Parliament. The employers were not united and backed down. In 1932 the employers issued a wage cut, and after a month of struggle an agreement was brokered which included a 6 looms more-looms option. In 1933 Burnley employers introduced a 6-looms system for about a third of its workers. A third continued on the four loom rates and a third continued a four loom system while paying 6 loom rates. The Cotton Industry Act 1934 legalised weavers' wage rates forcing employers to pay the standard wage rates that had been negotiated through collective bargaining. The effect of the 1934 rates were that a four loom weaver would have an average wage of 33s 9d while a six- loom more-loom weaver would get 41s 7d. By 1935 employers in other towns had discovered that they were not realising any savings and would incur costs in implementing the system, the employers enthusiasm for change waned. Improvements in weaver's rates were made in 1936, though not an agreement for a minimum wage. An upturn in demand in 1937 reduced the number of underemployed weavers, and more-looms was put on hold.  World war two and weaving out  During the hostilities all manufacture was under Government control. Buildings were requisitioned for the war effort, and the quiet spinning mills and weaving sheds of Lancashire were put to other purposes. A good example is how Rover and Rolls-Royce moved into Barnoldswick to produce and later design aero engines. When weaving was re-established in the early 1950s, expectations and attitudes had changed, and the thousand loom sheds such as Queen Street Mill were laid out in eight and ten loom sets and the weavers were on minimum wage contracts. Britain had become a net importer of cotton cloth. Slowly each mill began weaving out. The last mill Bancroft Shed closed in December 1978.

In the early twentieth century, the art scene was dominated by the work of the members of the Glasgow School known as the Four, led Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who gained an international reputation for their combination of Celtic revival, Art and Crafts and Art Nouveau. They were followed by the Scottish Colourists and the Edinburgh School. There was a growing interest in forms of Modernism, with William Johnstone helping to develop the concept of a Scottish Renaissance. In the post-war period, major artists, including John Bellany and Alexander Moffat, pursued a strand of \\"Scottish realism\\". Moffat's influence can be seen in the work of the \\"new Glasgow Boys\\" from the late twentieth century. In the twenty-first century Scotland has continued to produce influential artists such as Douglas Gordon and Susan Philipsz. Scotland possess significant collections of art, like the National Gallery of Scotland and National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh and the Burrell Collection and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. Prominent schools of art include the Edinburgh College of Art and the Glasgow School of Art. The major funding body with responsibility for the arts in the country is Creative Scotland. Support is also provided by local councils and independent foundations. Early twentieth century Glasgow School Sleeping Princess, 1909, by Frances Macdonald For the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The most important grouping, active from about 1890 and known as \\"The Four\\" or the \\"Spook School\\", was composed of acclaimed architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868‚Äì1928), his wife the painter and glass artist Margaret MacDonald (1865‚Äì1933), her sister the artist Frances (1873‚Äì1921), and her husband, the artist and teacher Herbert MacNair (1868‚Äì1955). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style.S. Tschudi-Madsen, The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), , pp. 283‚Äì4. Scottish Colourists The Coffee Pot, by Samuel Peploe (1905) The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was retrospectively given to John Duncan Fergusson (1874‚Äì1961), Francis Cadell (1883‚Äì1937), Samuel Peploe (1871‚Äì1935) and Leslie Hunter (1877‚Äì1931). They knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914I. Chilvers, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), , p. 575. and looked for inspiration to Paris, particularly to the Fauvists, such as Monet, Matisse and C√©zanne, whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland. They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post- impressionism reached Scotland. Fergusson in particular would later be a major influence on bringing modernism to Scottish art. Edinburgh School The group of artists connected with Edinburgh, most of whom had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, became known as the Edinburgh School,\\"The Edinburgh School\\", Edinburgh Museums and Galleries, retrieved 10 April 2013 many of whom belonged to the informal 1922 Group.http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/1922-group, retrieved 7 October 2015 They were influenced by French painters and the St. Ives School.D. Macmillan, \\"Culture: modern times 1914‚Äì: art\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 153‚Äì4. Their art was characterised by use of vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and the use of bold technique above form. Members included William Gillies (1898‚Äì1973), who focused on landscapes and still life, John Maxwell (1905‚Äì62) who created both landscapes and studies of imaginative subjects, William Geissler (1894-1963),http://www.s-s-a.org/presidents-and- secretaries/http://www.rsw.org.uk/pages/past_members.php?pageNum_rsPastMembers=10&totalRows;_rsPastMembers=313 watercolourist of landscapes in Perthshire, East Lothian and Hampshire,The Life and Art of William Geissler (1894-1963): Norman Shaw, MPhil Thesis, Edinburgh College of Art, 1994The Art of William Geissler 1894-1963, Poetry of Place, Author: Alistair (Introduction) Rowan, Publisher: Edinburgh College of Art, 1996 William Crozier (1893‚Äì1930), whose landscapes were created with glowing colours, William MacTaggart (1903‚Äì81), noted for his landscapes of East Lothian, France and Norway and Anne Redpath (1895‚Äì1965), best known for her two dimensional depictions of everyday objects. Modernism and the Scottish Renaissance Stanley Cursiter Regatta (1913) The philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854‚Äì1932) coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance in his magazine Evergreen. He argued that technological development needed to be in parallel with the arts. These ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet Hugh MacDiarmid who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art and the creation of a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including Stanley Cursiter (1887‚Äì1976), William McCance (1894‚Äì1970), William Johnstone (1897‚Äì1981) and Fergusson.D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , p. 348. Stanley Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism, as can be seen in his Rain on Princess Street (1913) and Regatta (1913). He went on to be a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney, director of the National Gallery of Scotland and proposed the creation of a National Gallery of Modern Art in 1930.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 163‚Äì4. Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism and probably played a major part in the formulation of MacDiarmid's thought. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings like Damaged Destroyer (1918). He co-operated with MacDiarmid on the journal Scottish Art and Letters and MacDiarmid quoted extensively from his work.Macmillan, Scottish Art , p. 350. William McCance's early work was in a bold post- impressionist style. After the First World War he moved to London with his wife, fellow student Agnes Miller Parker (1895‚Äì1980), where he joined the same circles as Fergusson, vorticist Wyndham Lewis (1882‚Äì1957) and nationalist composer Francis George Scott. Under these influences his work became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in Women on an Elevator (1925) and The Engineer and his Wife (1925).Macmillan, Scottish Art, pp. 348‚Äì50. William Johnstone (1897‚Äì1981) was a cousin of F. G. Scott and met MacDiarmid as a student at Edinburgh. He studied cubism, surrealism and was introduced to new American art by his wife the sculptor Flora Macdonald. He moved towards abstraction, attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, A Point in Time (1929‚Äì38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as \\"one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century and one of the most remarkable pictures by any British painter in the period\\".M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 173.Macmillan, Scottish Art, pp. 351‚Äì2.D. Macmillan, \\"Review: Painters in Parallel: William Johnstone & William Gillies\\", Scotsman.com, 19 January 2012, retrieved 8 May 2012. The MacDiarmid Memorial by Jake Harvey (1982‚Äì84) Other artists influenced by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907‚Äì98) and Edward Baird (1904‚Äì49). Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of Bruegel. They focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's Traquair House (1938) and more overtly Baird's The Birth of Venus (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included William Wilson (1905‚Äì72) and Ian Fleming (1906‚Äì94).MacDonald, Scottish Art, pp. 175‚Äì6. New Scottish Group The longest surviving member of the Scottish Colourists, Fergusson, returned to Scotland from France in 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, where he became a leading figure of a group of Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established Glasgow Art Club. In 1942 they held the first exhibition of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president.D. Macmillan, Scottish Art in the 20th century, 1890‚Äì2001 (Mainstream, 2001), p. 80. The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904‚Äì79), who was influenced by expressionism. William Crosbie (1915‚Äì99) was strongly influenced by surrealism. Marie de Banzie (1918‚Äì90), was influenced by expressionism and particularity post-expressionist Gauguin. Isabel Babianska (b. 1920), was influenced by expressionist Chaim Soutine. Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900‚Äì88), which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of Van Gogh. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees Josef Herman (1911‚Äì2000), who was resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943D. Macmillan, Scottish Art, 1460‚Äì1990 (Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 370‚Äì1. and Jankel Adler (1895‚Äì1949) who was in Kirkudbright from 1941‚Äì43.MacDonald, Scottish Art, p. 187. Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914‚Äì85) and Bet Low (1924‚Äì2007), who with painter William Senior (b. 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art. Their work included industrial and urban landscapes such as MacDonald's Transport Depot (1944‚Äì45) and Bet Low's Blochairn Steelworks (c. 1946). Photography In the early twentieth century notable photographic work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882‚Äì1966), whose produced illustrations for the work of Robert Louis Stevenson and Paul Strand (1890‚Äì1976), as well as atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy (1913‚Äì95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and Oscar Marzaroli (1933‚Äì88), but, having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in the early twentieth century.D. Burn, \\"Photography\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 476‚Äì7. Later twentieth century to the present Post-war artists The \\"CLAUDI\\" Bridge at Ian Hamilton Finlay's Little Sparta Notable post-war artists included Robin Philipson (1916‚Äì92), who was influenced by the Colourists, but also Pop Art and neo- Romanticism.MacDonald, Scottish Art, pp. 189‚Äì90. Robert MacBryde (1913‚Äì66), Robert Colquhoun (1914‚Äì64) and Joan Eardley (1921‚Äì63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo- Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler. The English-born Eardley moved to Glasgow and explored the landscapes of Kincardineshire coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets.MacDonald, Scottish Art, pp. 191‚Äì2. Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the St Ives School were Wilhelmina Barns-Graham (1912‚Äì2004) and Margaret Mellis (1914‚Äì2009).MacDonald, Scottish Art, p. 193. Paris continued to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with William Gear (1916‚Äì97) and Stephen Gilbert (1910‚Äì2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde COBRA group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution.Macmillan, Scottish Art, p. 376. Also a visitor to Paris was Alan Davie (b. 1920-2014),MacDonald, Scottish Art, p. 194. who was influenced by jazz and Zen Buddhism, and moved further into abstract expressionism. Ian Hamilton Finlay's (1925‚Äì2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially concrete poetry) and landscape architecture. His most ambitious work, the garden of Little Sparta opened in 1960. Scottish Realism and the Glasgow Pups David Mach's Big Heids, Lanarkshire, a tribute to the steel industry John Bellany (1942‚Äì2013), mainly focusing on the coastal communities of his birth, and Alexander Moffat (b. 1943), who concentrated on portraiture, grouped under the description of \\"Scottish Realism\\", were among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s.C. Richardson, Scottish Art Since 1960: Historical Reflections and Contemporary Overviews (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), , p. 58. The artists who came to prominence in the 1980s, sometimes known as the \\"new Glasgow Boys\\", or \\"Glasgow pups\\", were associated with Moffat and the Glasgow School of Art.Chilvers, The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists, p. 255. They included Steven Campbell (1953‚Äì2007), Peter Howson (b. 1958), Ken Currie (b. 1960) and Adrian Wisniewski (b. 1958). Their figurative work had a comic book-like quality and put an emphasis on social commentary.D. Reid, The Rough Guide to Edinburgh (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 114. Campbell and Wisniewski's post-modern painting adopted a whimsical approach to history. Campbell often employed figures reminiscent of characters from 1930s novels confronted by the disorder and confusion of the real world, as in his Young Men in Search of Simplicity (1989).Macmillan, Scottish Art, p. 405. Currie revived historical painting devoted to the socialist history of Glasgow in a series of paintings for the People's Palace in 1987. Currie also approached the problems of historical painting through his series of prints The Saracen Heads (1988).Macmillan, Scottish Art, p. 406. A parallel movement in Edinburgh, focused around the 369 Gallery in the city, included Caroline McNairn (b. 1955‚Äì2010), Robert Maclaurin (b. 1965) and Gwen Hardie (b. 1962).MacDonald, Scottish Art, p. 212. Sculpture The sculpture of Eric Schilsky (1898‚Äì1974) and Hew Lorimer (1907‚Äì93) was in the existing tradition of modelling and carving. In contrast sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi (1924‚Äì2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world.L. A. Rose, M. Macaroon, V. Crow, Frommer's Scotland (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 12th edn., 2012), , p. 25. New sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation among a new generation of sculptors that incorporated aspects of modernism, such as Jake Harvey (b. 1948), Doug Cocker (b. 1945), Ainslie Yule (b. 1941) and Gavin Scobie (1940‚Äì2012). In contrast Sandy Stoddart (b. 1959) works primarily on \\"nationalist\\" figurative sculpture in clay within the neoclassical tradition. He is best known for his civic monuments, including bronze statues of the philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith, on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.C. Aslet, \\"Alexander Stoddart: talking statues\\" The Daily Telegraph, retrieved 12 July 2008. Photographic renaissance The first room of the installation The Object Moved by its Own Success, by Sandy Smith and Alex Gross (2008) In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough (1945‚Äì85) who founded the Stills Gallery for photography in Edinburgh in 1977 and Murray Johnston (1949‚Äì90), who was its director (1982‚Äì86).C. Henry, \\"Scots photography loses a champion\\", Glasgow Herald, 6 January 1990, retrieved 9 February 2013. Notable practitioners in Scotland included the American Thomas Joshua Cooper (b. 1946). More recent exponents who have received acclaim include Pradip Malde (b. 1957), Maud Sulter (1960‚Äì2008) and Owen Logan (b. 1963). Contemporary artists Since the 1990s, the most commercially successful artist has been Jack Vettriano (b. 1959), whose work usually consists of figure compositions, with his most famous painting The Singing Butler (1992), often cited as the best selling print in Britain. However, he has received little acclaim from critics.Chilvers, The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists, p. 657.

Plot Uneducated, disaffected white youths known as skinheads are attacking racial minorities in the US. A government agent investigating the incidents traces them to a wealthy, extreme right-wing, neo-Nazi businessman who is secretly bankrolling the skinheads to carry out his wishes, allowing him to keep his hands clean as he preaches a non-violent message to his wide following. Nick Stone (McColm) is an agent with the National Security Agency who wants to retire after his last job going undercover as a weapons dealer resulted in the death of a fellow agent. He meets up with his boss Col. West to tell him about his retirement, but West offers him one last mission. To take down Andrew Kendrick (Savage), a charismatic and dangerous white supremacist and his Neo-Nazi militia group hellbent on taking over the United States with his sleeper cells. Nick often works alone but West tells him that he will be working with a team composed of Commander Sam Guinness (Rubin), Vince D'Angelo (Ben Paul- Victor), a womanizing computer expert from Hollywood, Billy Ryan (Michael Covert), a redneck sharpshooter, Joe Nakamura and Winston Mad Dog Powell, (Real Andrews), a disgraced Detroit cop. Forming an elite group of soldiers, each with their own set of skills, the group's first assignment is to infiltrate a warehouse owned by Kendrick which may be housing \\"The Spear of Destiny\\", an ancient spear used in the crucifixion of Jesus and believed by Kendrick to give him ultimate power in his goal. The team storm the warehouse. The team however don't work together despite constant orders from Commander Guinness which results in Nakamura's death and the spear not being recovered. Despite the failed mission, Col. West's boss Colonel Gregori proposes to take the team to his cabin in the pacific Northwest. Under his guidance and training, the team become better and Gregori names them The Red Scorpions. A second infiltration is planned in which Winston enters one of Kendrick's gatherings and Ryan, who establishes himself there as a violent racist redneck from the south. Impressed, Kendrick offers Ryan a chance to work for him. Billy is taken to the group's own heavily guarded camp where Kendrick is training an army. However, after he sleeps with Kendrick's female assistant Donna (Kaiser), the game is up and Ryan gets thrown in a dungeon. Stone and Guinness then infiltrate the camp, who are about to launch a nationwide campaign of violent action unless they are stopped in time. The pair pose as a couple interested in investing within the group, however they are soon discovered, although they manage to successfully lead their team of high specialized assassins and technicians on the raid of the covert American hate group. Stone is later tortured by Hans (Kulich) who later fights him in a battle to the death. Guinness manages to kill Donna and help Winston and D'Angelo infiltrate the camp and in the chaos, the team take out the Neo- Nazi's. Kendrick dies when his lair where he planned to launch his sleepers explodes and he slowly burns to death. The team are then picked up by helicopter after killing Hans whom they viciously gun.

Plot Bo is a young girl who was born with special supernatural abilities that she could not control. As these powers started evolving, the people who were protecting her were forced to turn to an outsider for help. This led them to William Tate, a wrongfully convicted death-row inmate, whom they break out of prison. Although he is reluctant to take on the role as her protector, the two eventually form a bond that guide them to helping each other, as well as others, while staying one step ahead of the evil forces that want the girl. Cast and characters Main * Jake McLaughlin as William Tate, Jr. ‚Äì Originally a death row inmate in a national security prison, Tate is weathered and jaded from seven years of imprisonment and the painful loss of his soul mate Nina Adams (not knowing Skouras forced her to end their relationship). Tate has recurring anger problems, leading to a long history of violence and brushes with the law. Minutes before his execution for two counts of felony murder (of which he claims he is innocent, something no one ever believed, having been framed by his friends during a robbery), Winter (disguised as a priest) visits him and offers a chance at freedom if he agrees to protect Bo. Tate reluctantly agrees to accept Winter's assistance, and later his employment offer as Bo's protector. Originally he is unaware that he is actually Bo's father (a fact known by Winter's team, the Orchestra Project and the FBI), but Winter is later encouraged by Bo to tell him ‚Äì while the news sounds unbelievable, he senses he somehow knew all along. Afterwards, he becomes a more kind and supportive parent figure. * Johnny Sequoyah as Bo Adams ‚Äì An extraordinarily gifted girl with the power to change the world. She was one of Winter's most promising subjects, born and raised at Orchestra and displaying extraordinary psychic and telekinetic powers inherited from her mother, Nina. To the government, Bo's existence is highly classified government property and is officially a national defense priority. Bo herself is regarded as a federal asset and ward of the U.S. government, with no family. Winter is the only person Bo knows she can trust, and also she considers his team the closest thing to a family she has, but she steadily develops a bond with Tate after he repeatedly risks his life and freedom for her. Originally, she was unaware that Tate is her father, although later correctly guesses, and accepts, the truth. * Jamie Chung as Janice Channing ‚Äì Winter's second in command and an Orchestra fugitive. Dedicated, tough and strong-willed, Channing is devoted to protecting Bo. She frequently clashes with Tate, openly doubting his loyalty and feels the arrangement for him to act as Bo's protector is never going to work ‚Äì Channing sees herself as a mother figure to Bo, and believes she would be better at protecting the child, although later accepts Tate as a worthy parent figure. According to her background, she is a combat-trained fighter who was Orchestra's head of security ‚Äì she worked at the Orchestra Campus for Skouras for several years, hired to effectively keep Bo captive. Later she deployed as an operative to recover Bo, although she instead turned Channing against Skouras after she had healed the injuries Channing sustained trying to capture her. * Kyle MacLachlan as Dr. Roman Skouras ‚Äì A world-famous geneticist and head of Orchestra - a government sanctioned program and top secret classified operation designed to weaponize individuals with psychic abilities, funding it through his corporation Skouras Worldwide. Skouras is Winter's old partner, now mortal enemy. He is admired by many people for his work, and is a publicly awarded humanitarian, although others know he only cares about his own ideas and doing anything to achieve them. Skouras is a very powerful man working in cooperation with high-level elements of the U.S. government to locate Tate and recover Bo unharmed. He subsequently employs assassins, hires mercenaries and uses every resource at his command to recover the gifted prodigy and return her home to Orchestra. He claims he is only acting to protect Bo and offer proper guidance as a gifted telekinetic and psychic, but in truth he wants to market Bo's abilities as a weapon to the military. His nefarious schemes cost him his partnership with Winter who, with his team, broke ranks and fled with Bo, as Skouras's goals would endanger her. Skouras's erratic behavior and questionable experimentation methods (which are caused in no small part by pressure from the military, who are putting him under increasing pressure to deliver a telepathic weapon as he had originally promised) leads his other researchers to doubt his intentions, but also to improvements in his other telepathic subjects, which he uses to further his objectives for Bo. According to his background, his parents are named Evelyn and Ronald, and he was born in Oak Park, Illinois on December 1, 1954. According to Winter, Skouras's darkest secret is he has established another program, a top secret black ops plan for other telepaths; he plans to use his weaponized telepaths to build his own psychic army. * Delroy Lindo as Dr. Milton Winter ‚Äì A cunning and brilliant scientist and the leader of a shadow organization responsible for protecting individuals with rare and incredible powers. He is Skouras's old partner, now mortal enemy. He is dedicated to protecting Bo from Skouras and the army of henchmen he employs. Originally, Winter and his team used to work at Project Orchestra beside Skouras, and Winter raised Bo in the facility from infancy. At some point in the process, Winter and his entire team defected from Orchestra, took Bo, and went on the run. Winter also faked his death, working from that point to protect Bo. According to his background, he worked at DARPA and MIT, and was a CIA field agent psychologist ‚Äì Skouras describes Winter as \\"the global authority on the conscious and unconscious mind\\". Recurring *Juri Henley-Cohn as Luke Hayden ‚Äì One of Winter's team and an Orchestra fugitive. Hayden later becomes disillusioned with the mission to protect Bo after the deaths of four of the ten team members, and ultimately feels he could not make the necessary sacrifices. He abandons the team, and is arrested by the FBI shortly after. Ferrell turns Hayden to apparently give up Winter's command center in New York, only for Ferrell's team to find it deserted. *Richard Hollis as Robert Gilman ‚Äì One of Winter's team and an Orchestra fugitive. *Katie McClellan as Lilah Leeds ‚Äì One of Winter's team and an Orchestra fugitive. She is a technology specialist, and was on the team that developed Orchestra's prototype telepathic tracking computer. *Kerry Condon as Dr. Zoe Boyle ‚Äì Orchestra's head of research and Winter's replacement, Zoe is Skouras's head researcher and loyal confidant at Orchestra, who runs the research program following Winter's departure ‚Äì working to continue experiments with the other talented telepaths at the facility. Zoe helped Winter raise Bo, and cares about her very deeply. After Winter's departure, Zoe wants Bo returned home to Orchestra (primarily due to the possibility that Bo's health could degrade due to her abilities), seeing her as one of a kind and vulnerable in the outside world. Nevertheless, Bo remains the common ground that allows Winter and Zoe to trust each other - she is aware that Winter took Bo as the military would use her as a weapon, and also isn't comfortable with Skouras's excessive experimentation methods. In no position to challenge his authority, Zoe secretly acts as Winter's mole inside the Orchestra Campus, until she is exposed to Skouras by Dani, another test subject. Skouras has Dani mentally erase all of Zoe's memories of Bo and Orchestra. *Arian Moayed as Corey ‚Äì A technology specialist working at Orchestra. He is completely loyal to Skouras. *Erik LaRay Harvey as Marcus Krakauer ‚Äì A mercenary on loan from the CIA, and a tracker not on the FBI's radar, who is rumored to be psychotic. He is hired by Skouras as an operative to track down Bo and Tate. *Nick Tarabay as Niko Zepeda ‚Äì Skouras's henchman working at Orchestra. *Peter McRobbie as FBI Director Lofton ‚Äì The Director of the FBI and Ferrell's superior. He is one of the government administration members working with Skouras and Orchestra. He acts as a liaison with Skouras to the government, while also giving Ferrell permission to use federal orders and other ample resources for the investigation to locate and recover Bo. Later, Ferrell informs Lofton she has quit the Tate case but will still remain with the FBI. *Trieste Kelly Dunn as FBI Special Agent Elizabeth Ferrell ‚Äì The FBI agent in charge of full-fledged manhunt launched to recapture escaped death row inmate William Tate, Ferrell is solicited by the Director of the FBI to help and work with Skouras and Orchestra to track down Tate and Bo. Skouras emphasizes repeatedly that Bo is his top priority, assuring her that Bo's safety is his main concern, but she can tell he's not being entirely honest with her. Ferrell issues a nationwide AMBER Alert, broadcasting photos of Bo and Tate on every news channel over Skouras's repeated objections. Originally adopting traditional FBI methods to apprehend Tate, whom she sees as a very dangerous fugitive, and \\"rescue\\" Bo, whom she sees as an endangered minor, Ferrell steadily begins to understand what Bo is capable of, and also begins realizing there is more behind the manhunt than originally assumed. According to her background, she has a young daughter named Sasha. After Tate and Bo save Ferrell and her daughter from a subway bombing, Ferrell finally accepts Tate's innocence and abandons her pursuit. *Matthew Rauch as FBI Agent Martin ‚Äì One of Ferrell's two best agents. *Ato Essandoh as FBI Agent Garner ‚Äì One of Ferrell's two best agents. *Rob Morgan as Joshua Carpenter ‚Äì An Orchestra test subject, Joshua was a promising telepath capable of matter manipulation, who has been with Orchestra almost three years, and was one of Skouras's most talented subjects. His experimentation had left him fully weaponized as an active telepathic assassin. Skouras sent his new weapon on a field assignment ‚Äì to track down Bo and locate and neutralize Orchestra's unknown insider leak (Zoe Boyle). During the confrontation, however, Bo attacked and left him incapacitated as he is mentally erasing a blogger's mind. Left in a coma with no possibility to recover, Skouras encouraged Shawn, his friend and fellow test subject, to \\"help\\" Joshua by putting him out of his misery, as well as showing his own strength. Shawn reluctantly kills his friend at Skouras' request. *Owen Campbell as Shawn ‚Äì An Orchestra test subject, Shawn is a promising telepath, not as powerful as Bo. He has suffered severe behavioral and emotional problems due to his ability, although Orchestra has worked hard to harness his gifts. Skouras orders Shawn's rapid development to satisfy Orchestra's military superiors, over Zoe's objections that Shawn's control over his abilities was fragile, and the risk of instability was too great. Skouras encourages Shawn to accept and embrace his gifts, and manipulates him into becoming an active telepathic assassin. Shawn reluctantly kills Joshua, his friend and fellow test subject now comatose, with his powers to show his strength. *Mia Vallet as Dani ‚Äì An extremely powerful telepath who was inadvertently discovered by Orchestra (when her powers are detected by Skouras's telepathic tracking computer), Dani is the most powerful telepath Orchestra has come across since Bo, but she is untrusting and fiercely independent when she quickly realizes the extent of her power. Skouras meets with Dani and eventually convinces her to be taken to Orchestra, and accepts Skouras' training to make her abilities stronger. Skouras sees Dani as his next masterpiece ‚Äì intending to turn her into his new weapon. Dani discovers Zoe is the Orchestra mole, and threatens to out her to Skouras if she interferes with Skouras' plan. According to her background, she is a homeless runaway with no family or friends, previously involved in foster care and group homes. Her earliest memory of having an ability was when she was five, while at school, she started telekinetically moving pencils, but her parents thought she was lying. When she was twelve, they became afraid of their daughter when they thought Dani killed her brother in an angry rage over her stolen diary. Episodes Development and production The series first appeared as part of NBC's development slate in September 2012. In January 2013, NBC green-lit production of a pilot episode. On May 12, 2013, the series was placed on the network's 2013‚Äì14 schedule, where it was expected to debut after the 2014 Winter Olympics. On July 17, 2013, co-creator and executive producer Mark Friedman departed the series. Cuar√≥n stayed on board as executive producer alongside J.J. Abrams. Friedman was ultimately succeeded by Dave Erickson. A few months later, in December, Erickson also stepped down as executive producer/showrunner and was replaced by Jonas Pate, who was serving as a co-executive producer and series director. Pate now runs the day-to-day production of the series along with Hans Tobeason, who serves as \\"on-set\\" producer in New York, where filming takes place. To allow a smoother transition for the new showrunners and accommodate script re-writes, production went on hiatus from December 20 to January 6, 2014. Every scene in the pilot episode is a long take (One of Cuaron's trademarks), but that format was dropped beginning with the second episode. Casting McLaughlin (Tate) was the first regular to be cast in February 2013, followed by Lindo (Winter),\\"Delroy Lindo to Co-Star in NBC's J.J.

The station broadcasts on 1280 kHz with a signal strength of 99 watts as well as online.https://services.crtc.gc.ca/pub/DocWebBroker/OpenDocument.aspx?AppNo=201401497\\"Campus radio poised for a return to the dial\\". The Ryersonian, September 12, 2014.\\"The Scope tries to catch some waves\\". The Eyeopener, September 17, 2014. The station officially launched on the AM band on March 31, 2016 after several weeks of test transmissions. CJRU's current license expires on August 31, 2021. The 1280 AM frequency was previously used by CFBN. Background CJRU has operated as an internet radio station since April 2013. In February 2014, an application was filed with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission for an AM license. The CRTC held a hearing on September 25, 2014 and released its decision approving a license December 11, 2014.\\"Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2014-644\\". Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, December 11, 2014. The internet station was started after Ryerson Radio's previous application to acquire a license for an FM license for CKLN-FM's former frequency of 88.1 MHz was rejected by the CRTC on September 11, 2012 in favour of indie rock station CIND-FM.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-485, Licensing of a new radio station to serve Toronto, CRTC, September 11, 2012\\"Indie-rock station coming to Toronto\\". Toronto Star, September 11, 2012. Ryerson-based CKLN-FM had previously broadcast on 88.1 from 1983 to 2011 when the station lost its license due to compliance issues.\\"CKLN appeal shutdown\\". Toronto Star, April 15, 2011. The station contrasts itself from its predecessor, CKLN. According to volunteer co- ordinator Emily Joveski: \\"One of the stigmas associated with radio at Ryerson is some of the mistrust [from some older students and faculty] lingering from the previous station. But we are different. We are actually accessible to all students, and we will be a positive influence on Ryerson as well as the community.\\" The application to the CRTC was supported by intervenors such as musician Ron Sexsmith, Blue Rodeo founding member Bob Wiseman, Toronto city councillors Kristyn Wong-Tam and Mike Layton, Liberal MP Chrystia Freeland and the National Campus and Community Radio Association. Governance CJRU is governed by a nine-member board of directors with includes three representatives of the student body, three representatives of Ryerson University's administration, one representative of the station's volunteers and two directors, chosen by the board, to represent the community at large. The board's chair is Gerd Hauck, the dean of Ryerson's Faculty of Communication & Design. Ted Rogers School of Management dean Steven Murphy and Radio Television Arts chair Charles Falzon also sit on the board on behalf of the university, while the president of the Ryerson Students Union sits as one of the student representatives. While two individuals intervening at the CRTC hearing opposed the station's application alleging too few community directors, the station responded by telling the CRTC that \\"it was appropriate to restrict membership in this case to avoid governance problems such as those that led to the revocation of CKLN-FM's licence, where a second competing board of directors was elected by members\\". The CRTC agreed in its decision that \\"the proposed governance model is appropriate and provides for balanced representation from students, the community, the university and volunteers\\". Format The terms of its license require CJRU to air at least 120 hours of local and Canadian programming a week with a format that will be \\"a mixture of pop, rock, dance, acoustic, folk, folk-oriented, world beat international, jazz, blues, hip-hop, and experimental music\\" with a \\"music discovery approach\\" focusing on emerging artists. The schedule also includes \\"in-depth spoken word programming and programming targeted to specific groups within the community\\". Transmitter CJRU leases transmitter space from a tower in Toronto's Port Lands district, at Unwin Street and Cherry Street, which is also used by CHHA 1610 Voces Latinas.

It was taken over by the Union Army to provide control of the Mississippi River south of the city. Plaque for Fort Pickering Fort Pickering Memphis Tennessee Topographical Map of Memphis and Vicinity. Surveyed & drawn by order of Maj. Genl. W. T. Sherman. History mound bunker entrance This area had earthwork mounds built by ancient indigenous peoples and used by the historic Chickasaw people, a band led by Chief Chisca. The former fort site is located within what is now the Chickasaw Heritage Park. In 1739, French colonists and militia built Fort Assumption here. During the American Civil War, the Confederate States Army built Fort Pickering on the site. The Confederates dug out the top of the mound and placed artillery there. An ammunition bunker was dug into the side of the mound. Union forces captured Memphis in June 1862. The Union army enlarged and expanded several areas of the fort. \\"The newly constructed fort stretched nearly two miles along the south Memphis bluffs from where DeSoto Park (Chickasaw Heritage Park) is located, all the way to Beale Street. It was outfitted with 55 guns and included structures needed to serve the large number of troops living in Memphis and those passing through. The Indian mounds were hollowed out and artillery was placed there, along with an ammunition bunker which was dug into the side of the mound. Buildings included a hospital, rail depot, water works, and a saw mill.\\" However, Fort Pickering's defenses were never put to the test and Union forces held Memphis throughout the war. The fort served as a major Union staging area during the Vicksburg Campaign. Status After Fort Pickering was demolished in 1866, all traces of the fort were removed and Memphis forgot about it - until 2007, when there was interest about the possibility of finding Civil War remnants still around. Trenches were excavated and archaeologists were able to identify two cisterns, brick foundation piers, and particularly, evidence of the defensive parapet and ditch. Further excavations found very few actual Civil War items. They had been thorough in the demolition of 1866. The items that were found were mostly evidence of an earlier residential area of a young Memphis. References External links * Archaeological Survey Weaver & Associates, 2007.

She then tells him the story of her murder and assists him as he takes revenge for her death. Utagawa Kuniyoshi 1845 In mythology and folklore, a vengeful ghost or vengeful spirit is said to be the spirit of a dead person who returns from the afterlife to seek revenge for a cruel, unnatural or unjust death. In certain cultures where funeral and burial or cremation ceremonies are important, such vengeful spirits may also be considered as unhappy ghosts of individuals who have not been given a proper funeral. Cultural background The concept of a vengeful ghost seeking retribution for harm that it endured as a living person goes back to ancient times and is part of many cultures. According to such legends and beliefs, they roam the world of the living as restless spirits, seeking to have their grievances redressed, and may not be satisfied until they have succeeded in punishing either their murderers or their tormentors. In certain cultures vengeful ghosts are mostly female, said to be women that were unjustly treated during their lifetime. Such women or girls may have died in despair or the suffering they endured may have ended up in early death caused by the ill-treatment or torture they were subject to.Henry Whitehead, The Village Gods of South India, Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1988 (First ed. 1921), Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom, Barcelona 1999, Exorcisms and appeasement are among the religious and social customs practiced by various cultures in relation to the vengeful ghost. The northern Ach√© people group in Paraguay cremated old people thought to harbor dangerous vengeful spirits instead of giving them a customary burial.Pierre Clastres, Chronique des indiens Guayaki. Ce que savent les Ach√©, chasseurs nomades du Paraguay. Plon. Paris, 1972 In cases where the person has been killed and the body disposed of unceremoniously, the cadaver may be exhumed and reburied according to the proper funerary rituals in order to appease the spirit. Others have been known to salt and burn their body, the place where they were killed or the instrument that they were killed with. Media Vengeful ghosts have been featured in many contemporary movies of different countries such as Candyman, The Grudge, The Pit and the Pendulum, Mostly Ghostly: Who Let the Ghosts Out?, Poltergeist, Ghost, The Fog, High Plains Drifter, The Ward, Cassadaga, Kaal, Left for Dead, Bees Saal Baad, Darling, Ragini MMS, Dark Shadows and the Troublesome Night film series, as well as the television series Spooky Valentine, Spooky Nights, Charmed, Ghost Whisperer, Supernatural and the popular Thai television soap opera Raeng Ngao.

Hurricane Mitch, the strongest storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, formed on October 22, and after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, it weakened and struck Honduras on October 29\\\\. While near peak intensity, Mitch struck the offshore Guanaja island, where it nearly destroyed the mangrove forest. On the mainland, the hurricane dropped torrential rainfall, and many gauges were washed away in mountainous areas where unofficial rainfall totals were as high as 1900 mm (75 in). The highest official total was at Choluteca in southern Honduras, which was more than half of the annual precipitation average there. The rains caused widespread flooding and landslides, although impact from winds was not as severe. The President of Honduras estimated that Mitch set back 50 years of economic development. The storm wrecked about 35,000 houses and damaged another 50,000, leaving up to 1.5 million people homeless, or about 20% of the country's population. Mitch directly caused $2.005 billion in damage, with an additional $1.8 billion in indirect costs. Most of the damage was ruined crops, and cash crop exports were cut by 9.4% in 1999, largely due to the storm. Over 70% of the transportation infrastructure was damaged, mostly damaged highways and bridges. Widespread areas experienced power outages, and about 70% of the country lost water after the storm. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, a large landslide affected three neighborhoods and formed a temporary dam. Floods in the city damaged buildings that were over 350 years old. Throughout the country, there were at least 7,000 fatalities, some reported in each department. Following the storm, officials in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8 billion over a several year period. Despite this, the gross domestic product began decreasing at the end of 1998, and contracted by 1.9% in 1999. Officials enacted a widespread curfew following the storm, and for 15 days temporarily restricted constitutional rights to maintain order. There were outbreaks in various diseases, and many residents faced food and water shortages. Due to the heavy damage, the name Mitch was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list. Preparations and background Satellite animation of Hurricane Mitch to the northeast of Honduras Hurricane Mitch formed on October 22 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, and it eventually intensified into a Category 5 on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale by October 26\\\\. By that time, the hurricane was just north of the coast of Honduras, and was expected by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models to turn to the north. When the track was more westward than expected, the NHC recommended early on October 26 for a hurricane warning to be issued for the northeastern Honduran coast, although difficulties in communications prevented their immediate implementation. Within a few hours, a hurricane warning was in place between Lim√≥n to the Honduras and Nicaragua border, including the offshore Swan Island. When Mitch still failed to turn to the north, the government of Honduras issued a hurricane warning for the remainder of their coastline. The hurricane weakened while turning to the south, and made landfall in Honduras 134 km (83 mi) east of La Ceiba, with estimated winds of 130 km/h (80 mph). Mitch continued to weaken while moving slowly westward across the country. On October 26, the Honduran Permanent Contingency Commission coordinated with neighboring countries regarding the storm. Officials initially issued a state of emergency for the offshore islands and five coastal departments, which was later extended to the rest of the country. The government increased emergency spending and created a National Emergency Commission. Officials advised residents to evacuate in flood-prone areas, although many people stayed for fear of being looted. Some left to stay with relatives during the hurricane. Prisoners in Tegucigalpa Central Penitentiary were evacuated to the national stadium. Before the storm struck, Honduras was facing decreased food supplies due to ongoing El Ni√±o conditions. The economy had been growing at a rate similar to the previous year until Mitch struck, and was largely dependent on exports. About 73% of the population was living in poverty when the storm struck. Hurricane Mitch set back the economies of various countries in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, after they had improved throughout the 1990s. Meteorological effects Landslide in Tegucigalpa from Mitch Due to weak steering currents, Hurricane Mitch moved slowly for about a week, both offshore and while moving through Honduras. Rainbands drew moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, producing high amounts of rainfall of over per day, beginning on October 26. In some areas, high mountain peaks contributed to high precipitation totals, and the highest amounts occurred in southern Honduras. The highest official total was at Choluteca, which represented more than half of the annual precipitation average; at the same location, fell in a 24-hour period on October 31, which was more than double the previous record set in 1985. At Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Honduras in the capital Tegucigalpa, rainfall totaled 294 mm (11.58 in). The total of on October 30 broke the record set in 1966 for the wettest day. At La Ceiba near where the storm made landfall, Mitch produced of rainfall, which is 30% of its annual rainfall; of the total, fell on October 27, which was the third highest amount there on record. There were unofficial rainfall totals in Central America as high as 1900 mm (75 in); rain gauges in mountainous areas were washed away. The high rainfall caused many rivers in the country to overflow \\"to an unprecedented extent this century\\", as described by the United Nations. The flooding caused the Choluteca River to change its course, forming an avulsion. Widespread flooding near the northern coast left behind about of sediment, which ruined forests and shrimp ponds. Flooding also affected the Pacific coast along the Gulf of Fonseca, leaving behind debris and sediment. In the country's interior, particularly the southern portion, the high rainfall caused hundreds of landslides, many of them shallow and about 95% in the form of debris flow. However, two earthflows caused significant damage near Tegucigalpa. In mainland Honduras, the winds were not as damaging as the rainfall, although offshore islands sustained heavy damage due to high winds. Offshore northern Honduras, it was estimated that Mitch produced waves as high as 13 m (44 ft). Impact Overall, Hurricane Mitch caused an estimated $3.8 billion in damage, of which $2.005 billion was from direct damages and the remainder from indirect costs. The overall impact represented about 70% of Honduras's annual gross domestic product (GDP). Offshore On October 27, the S/V Fantome, a schooner, last reported its location to the south of Guanaja, while trying to escape the brunt of the storm. The United States Coast Guard searched until November 4, when they observed the debris from the ship. All 31 people on board were presumed killed. On the offshore Guanaja island, waters rose about during the storm. The combination of storm surge and high winds severely damaged offshore islands. High waves eroded northern coastlines and damaged lagoons. Most of the Bay Islands had damage to their water facilities. Two days of winds exceeding destroyed nearly all of the plants and trees on Guanaja, uprooting or knocking down almost the entire mangrove forest. Most mangrove trees were an average of in height before they fell. Those remaining standing were damaged internally and unable to regrow. All trees lost their leaves on the island, and 70% of conifer trees were knocked down. Montane trees likewise experienced severe damage, although they made a recovery within a year. However, no mangrove trees had regrown there by three years after the storm struck, indicating the level of destruction. Tree damage also occurred on nearby Roat√°n island, although to a much lesser degree, and occurring on the eastern end. Winds there were generally less than 185 km/h (115 mph), and the tree damage was more random. Mainland Damaged house due to flooding Hurricane Mitch wrought significant damage to Honduras, affecting nearly the entire population and causing damage in all 18 departments. High winds near the coast knocked down trees, particularly in mountainous areas. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimated that Mitch caused the worst floods of the 20th century in the country. Severe flooding occurred in the northern region, which washed away more than 25 entire villages. In San Pedro Sula in northwestern Honduras, flooding covered several neighborhoods and the international airport. Near the coast, high waves destroyed hotels and houses while swollen rivers flooded nearby areas. Damage was heaviest in Col√≥n and Atl√°ntida departments. In the latter department, the Cangrejal River left heavy damage along its path after it flooded. In Choluteca and Valle departments in the southern portion of the country, river flooding swept away houses and affected neighborhoods. An estimated 70-80% of transportation network was destroyed, including most bridges and secondary roads, amounting to $236 million in damage. In mountainous areas, floods carrying debris damaged roads and bridges. A total of of bridges were damaged or destroyed, and an additional of approach roads were likewise damaged. Several vehicles were washed away due to the floods. In contrast to roads, there was little railway damage. There was minor impact to the nation's airports, limited to some damage to air traffic equipment. Seaports also sustained minor damage, although many lost electronic equipment. Hurricane Mitch left widespread power outages after damaging more than of power lines and several power plants. About 11% of Honduras's telephone lines were damaged during the storm. Landslides and flooding contaminated aqueducts in several cities, including 1,600 systems in rural areas. Many cities sustained damage to their water network, and about 70% of Honduras lost access to fresh water after the storm, although many rural areas had already been experiencing water shortages. The combined damage to transportation, communication, utilities, including power and water, was estimated at $665 million. Communications were disrupted after power outages, and there were also fuel and water shortages. Flooding damaged or destroyed industrial areas of Honduras, which affected exports and domestic products. Six maquiladora factories were damaged in the northern portion of the country, and one was destroyed in La Ceiba. Many businesses shut down, leaving many people unemployed who already lost their homes. Mitch also destroyed 123 health facilities nationwide and wrecked 4,835 classrooms, or 23%, of the classrooms. As a result, most classes that would have gone until November 30 were ended about a month early, allowing teachers to assist in helping others. Flooding in Tegucigalpa High water levels along the Choluteca River affected the capital, Tegucigalpa, reaching levels above their banks. Mitch largely destroyed the center of the city, including many residential buildings along river banks. The floods damaged about one-third of buildings, including some more than 350 years old. The storm destroyed the primary water mains in Tegucigalpa and neighboring Comayag√ºela, and of water piping had to be repaired. In central Tegucigalpa, there was a large earthflow along Cerro El Berrinche mountain that weighed . This landslide, the largest generated by Mitch in the country, destroyed the Colonia Soto section and damaged portions of two other neighborhoods. It carried debris, trees, and rocks, forming a temporary dam along the Choluteca River laden with sewage. Because the landslide was slow-moving, officials were able to evacuate before the river was stopped due to the temporary dam. Another smaller landslide destroyed several houses in the Colonia El Reparto section of the capital, although it was also slow-moving, and the residents were able to evacuate. Other landslides destroyed over 20 houses along the rivers in the city due to erosion along river banks. Across Honduras, agriculture sustained serious damage, with initial estimates of 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered for an extended period of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take a long period of time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000 bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1 billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage. Honduras's Social Fund for Housing estimated that 35,000 houses nationwide were destroyed with another 50,000 damaged, many of which were poorly built or in flood-prone areas. This left up to 1.5 million people homeless - about 20% of the total population - and was the highest number of victims from any natural disaster in Honduras's history. Over 30% of the populations of Choluteca, Col√≥n, and Cort√©s departments were left homeless. Housing costs were estimated at $344 million, including $221 million in housing damage; the rest included the costs for shelters, removal of debris, and loss of rent. Deaths and injuries Overall, Hurricane Mitch killed about 7,000 people in Honduras, with 11,000 missing in the months after the storm. There were 8,000 people listed as missing about ten days after Mitch struck, although problems with record-keeping made it difficult to determine the exact total. Choluteca Department in the southern portion of the country had the most deaths, with 1,200 fatalities. Francisco Moraz√°n Department, which includes Tegucigalpa, had about 1,000 deaths, and Yoro Department had 911 fatalities. There were deaths in every department, however. Many of the dead were buried in mass graves or were cremated. The storm injured 12,272 people nationwide, mostly in Choluteca and Cort√©s departments. Aftermath San Juancito Then-president Carlos Roberto Flores estimated that Mitch reversed 50 years of progress in the country. Officials estimated it would take at least 15 years to rebuild completely. The national gross domestic product (GDP) only grew at a rate of 3% due to the storm, compared with 5.1% in 1997, due to damaged infrastructure and lingering effects. In 1999, the economy of Honduras contracted by 1.9%, largely due to the storm. The Honduran government increased spending by 24.7%,. much of it emergency funds to restore communications and provide relief, which caused economic deficits. This caused inflation to increase from 13.6% to 15.7%. The Honduran government adjusted its economic plan, including privatization of various federal entities. For two years, the government temporarily halted taxes to businesses affected by the hurricane. In the storm's immediate aftermath, officials enacted a widespread curfew after reports of looting and vandalism. The government temporarily restricted constitutional rights for 15 days. Officials urged residents to restrict water and fuel use, and alcohol sales were halted. The widespread flooding and the crippled infrastructure forced officials to rely on a limited number of helicopters to operate search and rescue missions and deliver supplies. A helicopter carrying four people, including Tegucigalpa mayor and potential presidential candidate C√©sar Castellanos, crashed on November 1 while touring flood damage, killing everyone aboard. In some areas, residents did not receive assistance until November 12, more than two weeks after Mitch's landfall. About 285,000 people remained in 1,375 shelters, many of them schools, by three weeks after the hurricane struck. Some sports stadiums and churches were also used as makeshift shelters. Overcrowding at shelters caused various diseases. Due to the hurricane and the widespread destruction, the hurricane caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused an outbreak of Leptospirosis, notably in Cort√©s Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000 people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water. Even before the storm struck, the government of Honduras issued an appeal for international assistance. In the immediate aftermath, the United States provided $875,000 in aid. A portion went to purchasing and delivering food, while the majority utilized airplanes to participate in rescue missions and deliver supplies, such as plastic sheets and water. The United States ultimately gave $15 million in aid to Honduras through various United Nations organizations. Mexico donated food, medicine, and clothing, and Cuba sent a team of doctors and mobile hospitals. Uruguay donated a pump for the city of Choluteca to restore water there. Several European Countries sent aid to Honduras, in addition to donations from the European Union. France sent medical equipment, and the government of Japan provided a field hospital that helped 300 patients per day in the center of Tegucigalpa. Following the storm, the United Nations Development Programme sent a team to Honduras and El Salvador to determine the needs of the population. The Honduran government requested the team to assess the socio-economic impact of the storm. The World Food Programme provided $17 million worth of food to the country. The Pan American Health Organization focused on restoring water systems by providing latrines, while UNICEF sent large water tanks. The Inter-American Development Bank approved $197.4 million in loans in 1998, most of which due to Hurricane Mitch. The loans were to assist in rebuilding damaged infrastructure, including for water systems, transportation, and houses. Various countries provided nearly $2.8 billion to the country in aid, which limited the annual debt following the hurricane's damage. The foreign aid due to the storm largely ended by 2003. Overall cost for reconstruction was estimated at $2.5 billion, which was estimated to take four years. The cost for repairing the damaged houses was estimated at $484.8 million. Following the storm, workers made emergency repairs to the destroyed bridges and roads. The cost for rebuilding roads was higher than their damage cost due to planning for future flooding. Within a month, there were repairs to the power grid to a level of 550 MW, or 91.7% of what it was before Mitch struck. Water companies restored water to 60% of Tegucigalpa within a month of the storm striking. The Honduras delegation to the World Meteorological Organization requested the name \\"Mitch\\" be retired, following the hurricane. The 25 member committee voted in support to replace the name with \\"Matthew\\", which was first used in 2004. That name was later retired following its usage in 2016 due to the devastation it caused in Haiti in early October of that year, and was subsequently replaced by \\"Martin\\".

This is broadly defined as a synallagmatic contract between two parties, the lessor and the lessee, in terms of which one, the lessor, binds himself to give the other, the lessee, the temporary use and enjoyment of a thing, in whole or in part, or of his services or those of another person; the lessee, meanwhile, binds himself to pay a sum of money as compensation, or rent, for that use and enjoyment. The law of lease is often discussed as a counterpart to the law of sale. South African law, like its Roman counterpart, recognises three forms of the contract of lease: # locatio conductio rei, or renting or hire of a thing, movable or immovable; # locatio conductio operarum, or employment contract or hire of labour between an employer and an employee; and # locatio conductio operis, or contract for the supply of services, like the construction of a building, between an employer and independent contractor. So much in their incidents do these differ, however, that they are best regarded as three different types of contract. This entry is concerned with the first of the three, or what is known in English law as, and commonly called in South Africa, the contract of landlord and tenant.Bradfield and Lehmann Sale & Lease 136.  Nature of the contract  In dealing with a contract of lease, one has to distinguish between a lease of movable property (motor vehicles and office equipment) and a lease of immovable property. The lease of movable property is subject to the provisions of the National Credit Act (NCA).  Definition  In terms of the NCA, a lease is an agreement in terms of which * temporary possession of any movable property is delivered to or at the direction of the consumer, or the right to use any such property is granted to or at the direction of the consumer, * payment for the possession or use of that property is ** made on an agreed or determined periodic basis during the lifetime of the agreement; or ** deferred in whole or in part for any period during the lifetime of the agreement; * interest, fees or other charges are payable to the credit provider in respect of the agreement or the amount that has been deferred; and * ownership of that property, at the end of the term of the agreement, either ** passes to the consumer absolutely; or ** passes to the consumer upon satisfaction of specific conditions set out in the agreement. This definition has changed or departed from the common law, because in a contract of lease there has always been an expectation that, at the end of the terminal period, the goods will be returned in the same condition as they were received. A contract of lease of a movable is treated in the same way as an instalment agreement. The NCA does not apply in respect of lease of immovable property; the common-law rules governing such contracts have been left intact. Part C of the NCA,ss 8-11. dealing with the various categories of credit agreements, excludes a lease of immovable property from these categories. This means that a credit agreement does not include a lease of immovable property. It also means that the definition of a contract of letting and hiring of immovable property remains the same. Most sources describe the contract of lease as one whereby one party (the lessor) undertakes to grant to the other (the lessee) the temporary use and enjoyment of a thing in return for the latter's undertaking to pay rent. This definition differs from the one contained in the NCA. Some commentators on the Act have observed that it has in fact blended the lease of movables with a sale, and that this could create the problem of determining which naturalia of the contract will apply. In terms section 8(4) of the NCA, if the agreement provides that ownership will always remain with the lessor, the agreement is not a lease for the purposes of the NCA. It will, however, be a credit transaction in terms of section 8(4)(f), and will therefore be subject to the NCA, provided that a fee, a charge or interest is payable. A lease in terms of which the lessee pays rent which does not include a fee, charge or interest, and in terms of which ownership remains with the lessor throughout, will not be subject to the NCA. A contract in which a lessee hires property permanently is not a lease; it is another type of contract. See the case of Mutual Construction Co v Komati Dam Joint Venture.  Bilateral juristic act  The contract of lease is a bilateral juristic act: It gives rise to rights and duties between the parties. There are several statutes applicable to the contract of lease. The parties must be mindful of the relevant statutory provisions when drafting the lease. The rights and duties afforded by legislation may not be waived. For example, section 5(3) of the Rental Housing Act (RHA) sets out certain rights and duties, while section 5(4) states that such provisions may not be waived by either party, as they are for the mutual benefit of both parties. The contract of lease will be deemed to include these provisions. Such provisions include the provision that, before the tenant takes occupation, there must be a joint inspection of the leased premises for defects and the right to privacy. The contract of lease may be entered into orally, expressly or impliedly. One must bear in mind the provisions of the RHA, especially with regard to what constitutes a \\"dwelling,\\" as this includes a shack. If the tenant requests that the contract be reduced to writing, the landlord has no choice in the matter and must comply. The tenant has the right not to have the property searched and seized except in terms of a law of general application.Soffiantis v Mould.  Synallagmatic contract  It must be noted that the tenant is still protected by the common law naturalia. The exceptio non adimpleti contractus, whereby a defendant may avoid his obligations to the plaintiff based on poor performance by the plaintiff, still applies. See the case of Pete's Warehousing and Sales CC v Bowsink Investments and Ntshiqa v Andreas Supermarket.  Huur gaat voor koop  As noted above, in Roman law the contract of lease (locatio conductio) had three forms: the locatio conductio rei, the locatio conductio operis and the locatio conductio operarum. Roman-Dutch law adopted this position, and it is still in force in South Africa. The modern contract of lease is therefore the Roman locatio conductio rei, the rental or hire of a thing. Contrary to Roman law, however, is that in South Africa prevails the Roman-Dutch doctrine of huur gaat voor koop (‚Äúlease trumps sale‚Äù). The lessee has under a lease only a personal right against the lessor, allowing him to demand possession of the leased property (res locata). Once the lessee takes possession of the res, he acquires a limited real right erga omnes in the res for the duration of the lease and will thereafter be protected by the maxim huur gaat voor koop. For long leases, every successor-in-title of the lessor is automatically bound by the lease, but for short leases, the successors are not bound until the transfer of the res has been registered, irrespective of whether they are aware of its existence. The lessee's protection under the rule is conditional on payment of the rent for the unexpired term of the lease to the new lessor. The rule applies only to material terms; it therefore covers the option to renew a lease but does not bind the new lessor in respect of an option to purchase.  Lease and other branches of the law  = Law of property and lease = A lease is a property right which can either be ceded. = Contracts of sale and loan and lease = The NCA has blended the lease of movables with a sale. The rules of a contract of sale are sometimes applied in terms of a contract of lease, as where, for example, a third party fixes the sale or rental price. The rules of a contract of loan are also sometimes applied in terms of a contract of lease. In NBS Boland Bank v One Berg River Driver and Others, the court held that, save, perhaps, where a party is given the power to fix his own prestation, or to fix a purchase price or rental, a stipulation conferring upon a contractual party the right to determine a prestation is unobjectionable. This does not mean that an exercise of such a contractual discretion is necessarily unassailable; it may be voidable at the instance of the other party. It is a rule of the common law that, unless a contractual discretionary power is clearly intended to be completely unfettered, an exercise of such a discretion must be made arbitrio bono viri. The discretionary powers vested in mortgagees in terms of mortgage bonds conferring upon the mortgagees the right unilaterally to increase the original rate of interest payable by the mortgagor must therefore be subject to the aforesaid inherent limitation. Such a provision in a mortgage bond is therefore valid. In this case, in Van Heerden DCJ's obiter dictum, he noted that it is conceivable, albeit unlikely, that a stipulation may be so worded that an absolute discretion to fix a prestation is conferred on one of the parties. In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to express a view as to whether such a stipulation will be invalid as being in conflict with public policy, or whether the fixing of the prestation may only be assailed when it is done in bad faith. See also the case of Benlou Properties v Vector Graphics.  Source of rules and proof of contract's existence  The main source of the rules pertaining to the contract of lease is the common law, as modified by the Constitution, and the rules creating statutory naturalia. Examples of such statutes are ESTA, PIE, Land Reform Labour Tenants Act, RHA and NCA. Note the case of Pete's Warehousing, noted above. Regarding the common law in terms of competing leases, see the case of Croatia Meat v Millennium Properties. In these circumstances, it is noted that one must apply the rules of contract. See also the cases of De Jager v Sisana, Schmidt v Dwyer and Southernport Developments v Transnet.  Essentials of the contract  A lease is formed by agreement between the parties that one of them is # to let or to give the other the use # of ascertained property # at a fixed or fixable rent. = Agreement on use and enjoyment = Undistrubed use and enjoyment of property is known by the Latin term commodus usus. According to Karin Lehmann, the word \\"use\\" encompasses both * jus utendi, the right of using the property; and * jus fruendi, the right to gather and enjoy the civil and natural fruits of the property. The lessee does not, however, obtain jus abutendi: the right to take any of the substance of the leased property. Consequently, so-called mining leases, which allow the lessee to mine for and keep minerals, are not true leases. Nor is a contract allowing a person to cut timber on a farm, unless the trees are self-generating. See Drymiotis v Du Toit1969 (1) SA 631 (T). and Business Aviation Corporation v Rand Airport Holdings. Where premises are let for the purpose of conducting business, the commodus usus includes the fact that the lessor may not do anything which might impact negatively on the business. The lessee's right to commodus usus is one of the naturalia of a contract of lease. Where the profitability of the lessee's business has been reduced, the lessee's commodus usus has been impaired. In Sishen Hotel v Suid-Afrikaanse Yster en Staal Industri√´le Korporasie, the Appellate Division extended the right to commodus usus by interpreting the lessee's right against the lessor to include a restraint upon the latter to refrain from direct or indirect conduct which negatively affects the profitability of the leased thing. Botha AJ thus introduced the principle of equality into the law of lease by protecting the interests of the lessee against both direct and indirect interference with the profitable use of the leased thing. The conclusion that the right to profitability is an ex lege term in all commercial leases appears to have been received with mixed feelings and remains under suspicion. The extension was challenged in Sweets from Heaven v Ster Kinekor, where the question of the future profitability of leased premises arose when the lessor let property in the close vicinity of the lessee's premises to a business competitor of the first lessee. In Sishen, Botha JA had approached the question of whether or not a breach of the duty to provide commodus usus by the lessor constitutes a breach of contract as a question of the content of the lessor's common-law obligations to the lessee. Malan J, in Sweets from Heaven followed the approach submitted by Cooper: that the question of whether or not a lessor has committed a breach of contract can be decided only with reference to the terms of the contract. A tacit term is implied where the contract is silent on the point, but it is clear that the parties intended the term to be part of their agreement; they would not have contracted otherwise than on the basis of that term. In such a case, the common intention of the parties is inferred by the court from the express terms of the contract and the surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary that the parties should have consciously envisaged the situation; it is sufficient that their common intention was such that a reference to such a situation by the hypothetical bystander would have obtained a unanimous assertion of the implied term. Conversely, a term implied by law is one that the law attaches to the particular class of contract in the absence of agreement to the contrary by the parties. These terms are the naturalia of the contract. The obligation to provide the lessee with commodus usus is one such term; therefore, where the parties do not explicitly include a term in the contract which excludes this obligation, it will be implied by law. Ultimately, the lessor's obligation to provide the lessee with commodus usus is one of the naturalia of the contract of lease and, unless explicitly excluded in the contract, an ex lege term of all leases. It has not been disputed that profitability is included in commodus usus in commercial leases. Correct perusal of all contractual terms, argues Hawthorne, would have led Malan J to the same conclusion as Botha JA in the Sishen case. It must be noted that it is essential that the leased property be identified or identifiable. Furthermore, the lessor need not be the owner of the premises; lack of title does not affect the validity of the contract. If the lessor fulfils the obligation to give the use and enjoyment which he has promised to give, the lessee is not entitled to question the lessor's lack of title and is bound to perform his own obligations. If the lessor does not fulfil his obligation and has no title to the property, specific performance will not be ordered; damages is the appropriate remedy. Where the lessee already has the right to the use and enjoyment of the property to which the lease refers, there is no contract. Where, however, another has the right to the use and enjoyment of the property, the fact that the lessee is the owner does not invalidate the contract. If the property once existed but, without the parties being aware of the fact, ceased to exist before the negotiations were concluded, there is no contract. If the lessor deceives the lessee into thinking that it exists when it does not, however, the lessee has an action for damages for any loss he suffers. If a lessor bona fide represents that the property exists, when in fact it does not, the lessee has a claim for restitution and, if any loss has been suffered, damages for such loss. = Payment of rent = According to the common law, there is no contract of lease if there is no agreement on rent. Furthermore, the RHA requires rent to be agreed upon for the purposes of a rental agreement. The rent is usually a sum of money, in which case it must be either fixed in a definite sum or fixable by a method or standard, but may be in some other form, like a certain quantity, weight or measure of fruits or produce, or a certain proportion of the gross produce of the property. Whatever form the rent takes‚Äîand it cannot take the form of services‚Äîit must be definite or ascertainable. It may be agreed upon expressly or impliedly. The parties may nominate a third party to fix the rent. (See the Southernport Development and NBS Boland cases mentioned above.) This is, however, subject to a proviso: The determination must not be dependent entirely on the unfettered will of one party. Furthermore, it is assumed that the party will use his discretion arbitrium boni viri: that is, according to the judgment of a good man. The discretion, therefore, must be exercised reasonably and equitably; the determination may be set aside if it is unjust. In Proud Investments v Lanchem International, it was pointed out that it is essential in contracts of lease that the rent agreed upon by the parties be fixed in a definite amount (merces certa) or be determinable by a third person in accordance with the maxim certum est quod certum redid potest.  Certain and ascertainable  Agreement by the parties on a certain amount of rent, orally or in writing, is the most common way in which the rent is determined in contracts of lease. Subject to there being sufficient evidence to allow conversion into a particular sum of money in the circumstances of the case, the following formulae are acceptable: * \\"the amount paid by the previous lessee;\\" and * the \\"usual\\" or \\"customary\\" amount. If nothing is said, and there is a usual or customary amount, that amount will readily be implied. \\"A fair and reasonable amount\\" may lead to particular difficulties. This question was raised but not decided in Genac Properties v NBC Administrators. In Lobo Properties v Express Lift Co, the court held that the \\"fair and reasonable amount\\" formula was acceptable in appropriate circumstances. Note, however, that the actual decision on this aspect of the case was that the facts alleged did not justify an inference that the parties had agreed either upon any sum of money or any formula. In cases where the parties expressly or impliedly agree upon a \\"reasonable amount\\" or a \\"fair and reasonable amount,\\" the court must first consider what the parties meant when concluding the agreement and look to evidence in this regard, and then consider whether evidence is available to establish the amount in money in the circumstances of the case in question. There are four main possibilities when it comes to what the parties thought was a \\"fair and reasonable\\" amount: # They may have had in mind the usual amount paid for that kind of property. # Each may have had a separate amount in mind but within the same financial bracket (if, for example, they thought that the rent would be between R4,000 and R5,000, and each party had a different figure). # The contract may lay down a test to allow the rent to be charged if circumstances change. The test must be one that can be described as objective. Alternatively, there could be a procedure agreed upon by the parties to vary the rental under a particular set of circumstances. # There may be no similar or usual fee, because the property is unique. The parties may have meant a sum of money which can only be determined when one party or an indefinite third party applies his mind to the matter. Kerr states that it does not seem to be in accordance with the law to leave the decision to an arbitrium boni viri as that would mean leaving it to an indefinite third person. This Voet would not permit. Alternatively, if it were left to the court's discretion, this would not be in accordance with the law either, as it is not the duty of the court to make a contract between the parties. See Totoyi v Ncuka.  Amount of rent   Economic rent  The parties may arrive at the rental value which the property commands in the economic circumstances of the time or which the parties consider to be fair in the circumstances.  Nominal rent  This occurs where the parties intend to establish the legal relationship of lessor and lessee, but where the lessor is content not to make a profit out of the transaction because he has an overriding religious, social or even economic objective in view. Voet says that rent cannot take the form of ‚Äòa single coin‚Äô (= penny rent). This would imply that there is no lease, because it comes more to resemble a gift. The court must still consider the true nature of the transaction, however, as it is not legally impossible to have a lease with a nominal rent.  Commodities in which rent may be paid  The rent must be made in money or in quantities of the fruits of the property. Therefore, with regard to a lease of land for agricultural purposes, it is possible for the parties to agree that the rent is a percentage of the produce of the farm. The question has arisen: Is a contract is one of lease if payment is made other than in money or fruits? Many authorities take the view that, by law, rent cannot consist in anything other than money or fruits, but this prevents the enquiry's being pressed to its proper conclusion. It must be regarded as incorrect. In Roman law, the position was that, in an exchange, one cannot distinguish which party is buyer (lessee) and which the seller (lessor). This presents a problem, as their duties are very different. The fundamental question, however, is not whether or not rent may be paid in something other than money or fruits, but rather this: Can rent be paid in something other than money? In partiarian contracts, one of the reasons why payment in fruits does not affect the nature of the contract is that there can be no doubt about who is the lessor and who is the lessee, and no doubt, furthermore, about the residual obligations that each incurs. See Rubin v Botha and Jordaan NO and Another v Verwey. = Period of lease = The duration of the lease is for such period of time as the parties have agreed upon, either expressly or impliedly. Leases fall into three main categories in this regard: # those entered into for a fixed period, short or long, or until the occurrence of a certain event; # those whose duration is at the will of either party; and # those which have no fixed terminal point. This last category includes * periodical leases, which continue from week to week, month to month, or year to year, until it is terminated by reasonable notice from either party; and * leases in which the duration has to be determined by the residual rules If the parties have not made any agreement about the duration of the lease, it is a periodic lease, the period being that in terms of which the rent is payable. A lease at the will of one party cannot last longer than the lifetime of that party. If the relevant party dies during the course of a year, Pothier considers that the year must be completed. This is in the case of rural property and is based on the fact that the fruits are produced annually. If the parties enter into a periodical lease, they may stipulate the length of the period. If only the period for payment of rent is stated, this is an indication of the intended period required for notice. The parties may agree otherwise, however. If the parties leave the duration of the lease undefined, * in the case of urban tenements, the law requires that reasonable notice be given; and, * in the case of rural tenements, the unspecified period is understood to be a year, or the whole time necessary to enable the lessee to gather the fruits. The lessee must be allowed sufficient time to enable him to reap some real benefit from the transaction. In appropriate circumstances, a lease may be ended before the date originally set, or extended beyond the original date. This is usually done by mutual consent. New leases, whether express or implied, may also be entered into between the same parties. Pothier states that a lease entered into in perpetuity ‚Äòpasses over the bounds into another contract, namely emphyteusis‚Äô.  Formalities and types  In the law of contract, the contract may be subject to formalities that are prescribed either by the parties themselves or by statute governing specific conduct. No formalities are necessary for the validity of a lease as between lessor and lessee. The parties may agree, however, that the contract of lease is not binding until it has been reduced to writing and signed. See Woods v Walters. There is no vinculum iuris or binding tie between the parties until the formalities have been complied with. If it is unclear whether or not the written contract alone is intended to constitute the agreement, any mention of a written document made between negotiations will be assumed to record or facilitate proof of an oral agreement. No variation is allowed without including it in the written agreement. See SA Bus and Taxi Association v Cape of Good Hope Bank. In terms of formalities laid down by statute, one must distinguish between statutes which merely lay down penal provisions (like section 5(2) of the Rental Housing Act) and those statutes in respect of which non-compliance with formalities will render the contract invalid. See Eastern Cape v Contract Props. The legal position with regard to a lease not subject to the provisions of the NCA is that, as between the parties, there are no formalities required for the validity of the lease agreement, but formalities often will be necessary for effectiveness against third parties (like the landlord's creditors).  Movables  When dealing with leases of moveable property, one should note the formalities introduced by the NCA, particularly those relating to pre-agreement disclosures, delivery of the relevant documents free of charge, compliance with plain-language requirements, provisions relating to unlawful agreement and unlawful provisions in a contract, and the consumer's right of cooling off.ss 92-93. Other important legal provisions are those governing the rescission and termination of credit agreements.ss 121-122. Section 121, dealing with the consumer's right to rescind credit agreements expressly, states that the section applies only in respect of a lease or instalment agreement entered into at any location other than the registered business premises of the credit provider. In terms of section 121(2), a consumer may terminate a credit agreement within five business days after the date on which he signed the agreement, either by delivering notice in the prescribed manner to the credit provider, or by tendering the return of any money or goods; alternatively, he may pay in full for any services received by the consumer in respect of the agreement.  Registration of leases and subleases  Other aspects of the contract of lease that deserve special mention are those relating to the lease of land, in particular the requirements for the registration of leases and subleases. These are governed by sections 77 to 79 of the Deeds Registries Act (DRA).Act 47 of 1937. In terms of section 77(1), save where provision to the contrary is made in any law, any lease or sublease of land or of any rights to minerals in land, and any cession of such a lease or sublease intended or required to be registered in the Deeds Registry, shall be executed by the lessor and the lessee, or by the lessee and the sub-lessee, or by the cedent and the cessionary, as the case may be, and shall be attested by a notary public‚Äîprovided that any such lease shall be registered for the full term thereof. Section 77(1)bis states that, whenever a cession of a lease is to be registered in respect of any port ion of the land leased, a notarial copy of the lease shall be attached to such cession and after registration such cession with the notarially certified copy of the lease annexed thereto shall be deemed to be the title to the portion of the lease so ceded, and for any subsequent registration in respect thereof it shall be part of the title. The termination of a registered lease is regulated by section 78 of the DRA. It is important to note the steps to be taken by the registrar upon termination of a registered lease or sublease. Registration has a bearing on cessions of such leases or subleases. In terms of section 80 of the DRA, no cession of a lease or sublease shall be registered in any deeds registry unless the lease or sublease has been registered therein. In terms of section 81, no hypothecation of a lease or sublease shall be registered in any deeds registry unless such hypothecation is effected by means of * a mortgage bond, if the lease or sublease is immovable property; or * a notarial bond, if the lease or sublease is not immovable property. Registration is a requirement of the law in respect of long leases. The much-criticised section 2 of the General Law Amendment Act (GLAA) was repealed by the Formalities in Respect of Leases of Land Act, which came into operation on 1 January 1970. The main provisions of the Act are contained in section 1, which provides that ‚Äòno lease of land shall be invalid merely by reason of the fact that such lease is not in writing‚Äô.s 1(1). In terms of section 1(2), a long lease entered into after the commencement of the Act‚Äîthat is, after January 1, 1970‚Äîshall not be valid against a creditor or a successor under onerous title of the lessor for a period longer than ten years after having been entered into, unless * it has been registered against the title deed of the leased land; or * the aforesaid creditor or successor at the time of the giving of credit or the entry into the transaction by which he obtained the leased land or a portion thereof, or obtained a real right in respect thereof, knew of the lease. This section purports to remedy the defects inherent in the proviso to the old section 2, which reads as follows: > Provided that no lease of land which is entered into for a period of not > less than ten years or for the natural life of the lessee or any other > person mentioned in the lease, or which is renewable from time to time at > the will of the lessee indefinitely or for periods which together with the > first period of the lease amount in all to not less than ten years, and no > cession of such lease, shall be valid as against third parties if executed > after the commencement on this Act, unless registered against the title > deeds of the leased land. The general effect of the Formalities in Respect of Leases of Land Act is to reinstate substantially, if not completely, the alw as it existed prior to 1956, when the GLAA was enacted. In any event, the huur gaat voor koop doctrine is revitalized in so far as the previous legislation may have diminished its application to unregistered long leases. The overall result is that, apart from its validity inter partes, an unregistered long lease may be set up against all comers for the first ten-year period, but thereafter does not avail against creditors and onerous successors who had no knowledge of the lease. One of the worst features of the GLAA was believed to be the obscurity of the phrase \\"third parties.\\" If strictly construed, the proviso would abolish the well-established rule that registration is not necessary as against a successor who had notice of the long lease. A further difficulty was whether \\"third parties\\" included gratuitous successors. Again, on a strict interpretation, the question could have been answered in the affirmative. In Hitzeroth v Brooks,1964 (4) SA 443 (E). however, it was correctly decided that gratuitous successors were not \\"third parties.\\" The new section 1(2) clarifies the ambiguities of its predecessor: There is no mention of \\"third parties.\\" It seems clear that, after the first ten-year period, the only persons against whom an unregistered long lease may not be invoked will be onerous successors (and creditors) without knowledge of the lease. In view of the wording of section 1(2)(b) of the present Act, the tenant will only have to prove, after the initial ten year-period, that the landlord's successor‚Äîand he must be an onerous successor‚Äî\\"recognized and adopted\\" the lease in circumstances where he did not know of the unregistered lease at the time he entered into the transaction by which he obtained the leased land. Wille states that actual knowledge is required; it remains to be seen if constructive knowledge will suffice. Registration requirements are also mentioned in section 25(2)(a) of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, which provides for the registration of mining rights at the Mining Titles Office. In terms of section 11(4) of the Act, transfers, cessions, leases, subleases, alienations and mortgages, or variations thereof, must also be so registered. In terms of section 11, prospecting and mining rights may be transferred, let and sublet. Such dealing may not occur, however, save with ministerial consent. Draft regulations refer to sketch plans and diagrams that are required to be certified by a surveyor. = Formalities in Respect of Leases of Land Act = The much-criticised section 2 of the General Law Amendment Act was repealed by the Formalities in Respect of Leases of Land Act, which came into operation on 1 January 1970. The main provisions of the Act are contained in section 1, which provides that ‚Äòno lease of land shall be invalid merely by reason of the fact that such lease is not in writing‚Äô. This is subject to the following qualification:  Rental Housing Act  The Rental Housing Act came into operation on August 1, 2000. Its purpose is to give effect to the right of every citizen to have access to adequate housing, by promoting investment in the rental housing market. The Act creates measures aimed at protecting both landlords and tenants. In addition to repealing the Rent Control Act, as well as sections of the Sectional Titles Act, the Act also has an effect on the common law of lease, in that it creates statutory naturalia; it also limits the parties' contractual freedom. The RHA governs only leases of dwellings for housing purposes, but extends to all urban and rural areas. The RHA provides that a lease between a tenant and a landlord need not be in writing or be subject to the provisions of the Formalities in Respect of Leases of Land Act,s 5(1). but a landlord must, if requested to do so by a tenant, reduce the lease to writing.s 5(2). It is unusual to lay down that a contract need not be subject to the provisions of a specified statute. The question arises, therefore, of whether there are circumstances in which the provisions of the FRLL Act do not need to be applied. The answer is that this is possible when a lease is not in writing; if, however, the FRLL Act does not apply, cases must be decided as if this Act were not on the statute books. The law applicable, therefore, will be the non-statutory law before June 22, 1956. Under the non-statutory law, the result would be the same as it would be if the provisions were applicable. Under both, the lessee may claim registration against the title deeds only if the lease is in writing, and only if there is a title deed against which it can be registered. As the RHA applies, inter alia, to huts and shacks, there will in practice be many instances of dwellings on land for which there is no title deed, but this is not the result of, nor is it influenced by, the applicability of the FRLL Act. Furthermore, in the case of a long lease of properties for which there is a title, the parties (particularly the lessee) would be well advised to have the lease registered against the title deeds, and so bring themselves within the provisions of the FRLL Act. It appears, then, that the legislature, in providing in section 5(1) of the RHA that a lease ‚Äúneed not [‚Ä¶] be subject to the FRLL Act,‚Äù believed that those provisions imposed a burden of which the parties to leases of dwellings should be relieved. If so, as shown above, the legislature was under a misapprehension. Section 5(6) of the RHA provides that a lease contemplated in terms of section 5(2) must include the following information: * the names of the tenant and the landlord, and their addresses in South Africa, for purposes of formal communication; * a description of the dwelling which is the subject of the lease; * the amount of rental of the dwelling, and reasonable escalation, if any, to be paid in terms of the lease; * the frequency of rental payments, if rentals are not paid on a monthly basis; * the amount of the deposit, if any; * the lease period or, if there no lease period is determined, the notice period requested for termination of the lease; * obligations of the tenant and the landlord, which must not detract from the provisions of section 5(3) or the regulations relating to unfair practice; and * the amount of the rental, and any other charges payable in addition to the rental in respect of the property. Lastly, section 16 of the RHA makes it an offence to fail to comply with section 5(2), and provides a penalty of a fine or imprisonment. It is a crime, therefore, for the lessor to fail to reduce the lease to writing if the lessee asks for this to be done, or to fail to ensure that the information required by section 5(6), together with the list of defects and the copy of any House Rules there may be,These are required by ss 5(7)-(8). are found in the lease and its annexures.  Categories of leases of immovable property and effectiveness against third parties  = Long leases = A long lease (in longum tempus) must be notarially executed and registered against the title deed of the leased property. This is a lease for a period of not less than ten years, on which has been computed for the natural life of the lessee. This includes a lease which is renewable from time to time at the will of the lessee indefinitely. If it is not registered, it is not binding for a period in excess of ten years. There are exceptions to this general rule in the case of: # creditors who have acknowledged its existence at the time of entering the transaction or giving credit; and # a successor-in-title for value with no knowledge of the lease, who will be bound by it if he subsequently adopted it. In cases where there is a long lease, therefore, the lessee is protected from the time of registration. The rules relating to the effectiveness of long leases against persons other than the parties differ according to the time of entry into the lease. Three periods have to be distinguished.  Before 22 June 1956  The legal position during this period was summed up by O'Hagan J in Hitzeroth v Brooks. A long lease entered into before June 22, 1956, if it is to be binding on onerous successors and creditors of the lessor, must be registered against the title of the leased property, unless the successor has had notice of the lease. An unregistered long lease is always binding as between the immediate parties thereto, and upon gratuitous successors of the lessor, and is binding upon a purchaser who had no notice of the lease, for a period of not more than ten years, if the lessee was in occupation of the property when it was sold. In the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, however, it was provided by statute that no long lease should be of any force or effect against creditors or any subsequent bona fide purchaser of the property leased, unless it were registered against the title deeds of such property. Notarial execution was made an essential to the validity of such a lease inter partes. In Natal, it was prescribed that certain contracts, including a lease for a term of more than two years, had to be evidenced in writing in order to be enforceable.  22 June 1956 to 31 December 1969  Section 2 of the General Law Amendment Act, which began by laying down that no formalities were necessary for validity inter partes, contained a provision which read, > Provided that no lease of land which is entered into for a period of not > less than 10 years or for the natural life of the lessee or any other person > mentioned in the lease, or which is renewable from time to time at the will > of the lessee indefinitely or for periods which together with the first > period of the lease amount in all to not less than 10 years, and no cession > of such lease, shall be valid against third parties if executed after the > commencement of this Act (22 June 1956) unless registered against the title > deeds of the leased land. The provision suffered from considerable absurdity on the point of who the third parties were. The case of Hitzeroth establishes that a wife married in community of property, and subject to the marital power, being bound by a lease executed by her husband, is not, either during the subsistence of the marriage or after her husband's death, a \\"third party\\" as contemplated. Furthermore, one cannot merely say that \\"third parties\\" were all persons other than the original parties. The question which presented the greatest difficulty was the position of persons other than \\"third parties\\" who, before 1956, were bound by unregistered long leases: * gratuitous successors; * onerous successors who knew of the lease; and * onerous successors without knowledge of the lease who were bound for not more than ten years if the lessee was in occupation. The difficulty is one of interpretation: What did the legislature intend when it enacted the provision? The answer is suggested to be found by following the approach adopted by the Appellate Division \\"for the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general.\\" This is to consider the following questions: * What was the law before the Act? * What was the mischief and effect for which the law did not provide? * What did remedy the Parliament resolve and appoint to cure the disease of the commonwealth? * What was the true reason of the remedy? The office of all the judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. The law \\"before the Act\\" is the law before June 22, 1956. The term \\"mischief\\" applied to two matters: # There was some doubt about whether writing was necessary for validity inter partes. # There was a lack of uniformity in the law of the different provinces. The remedy in respect of validity inter partes was to lay down that writing was not necessary. This involved the repeal of the sections in the statutory law of the Transvaal, Orange Free State and Natal, which required writing for validity inter partes. Nothing further need have been done, as the removal of the repealed sections resulted in the fact that the common law would have been in force in all provinces and uniformity would have been achieved. Parliament included in the GLAA, however, the proviso on registration quoted above. Where, therefore, long leases entered into during the period under discussion are concerned, gratuitous successors are bound to recognise an unregistered lease; so are onerous successors who know of its existence. Onerous successors without knowledge are bound for the first ten years of the lease if the lessee is in occupation. In addition, a successor is bound if he recognises and adopts the lessee as a lessee under a lease.  On or after 1 January 1970  Section 1(2) of the Formalities in Respect of Leases of Land Act (in force from January 1, 1970) provides that > no lease of land which is entered into for a period of not less than ten > years or for the natural life of the lessee or any other person mentioned in > the lease, or which is renewable from time to time at the will of the lessee > indefinitely or for periods which together with the first period of the > lease amount in all to not less than ten years, shall, if such lease be > entered into after the commencement of this Act, be valid against a creditor > or successor under onerous title of the lessor for a period longer than ten > years after having been entered into unless‚Äî > (a) it has been registered against the title deeds of the leased land; or > (b) the aforesaid creditor or successor at the time of the giving of credit > or the entry into the transaction by which he obtained the leased land or a > portion thereof or obtained a real right in respect thereof , as the case > may be, knew of the lease. The form of the subsection does not call for any mention of gratuitous successors, but the express mention of a successor \\"under onerous title\\" shows that the legislature adopts the distinction between gratuitous and onerous successors in preference to that between universal and particular ones. Further, the difficulties introduced into the law by the enactment of the proviso to section 2 of the GLAA were repealed; the law returned to the common-law position. It is clear, therefore, that a gratuitous successor is bound by an unregistered long lease even though he did not know of its existence. Furthermore, there is no mention of the fact that, if the lessee is in occupation at the time of the sale, onerous successors are bound for the first ten years of the currency of the unregistered long lease, even though they did not know of its existence. On the principles and authorities mentioned, they are bound for the period mentioned. An onerous successor is bound for the whole period of a long lease if it is registered, whether or not he knew of its existence. In addition, an onerous successor is bound for the whole period of the long lease if he \\"knew\\" of the existence of the lease at the time of the entry into the transaction by which he obtained the leased land. In this regard, mere knowledge is insufficient, because occupation could be evidence of a short lease. There must be knowledge that there was a long lease. The onus of proving the requisite knowledge is on the lessee. With regard to the time period when the onerous successor has knowledge, the expression \\"at the time of entry into the transaction\\" leads one to think that Parliament meant \\"at the time of sale,\\" because one commonly refers to sale, but not to registration, as a transaction. In particular, one does not normally speak of \\"entering into\\" registration. The continuation of the phrase by the words \\"by which he obtained the leased land\\" leads one to think that Parliament meant \\"at the time of registration,\\" because one obtains land on registration and not on sale. In light of these obscurities, the purpose of the Act as a whole is to return to the common law. Unfortunately the common- law position is not clear. There are indications that the courts tend to prefer the date of sale, but such statements have been subjected to strong criticism. For the sake of completeness, note that a lessee of land which is owned by the lessor is entitled to have a long lease registered, and can compel the lessor to render whatever assistance is necessary to obtain registration. If ownership of the land leased does not vest in the lessor, the owner's consent must be obtained before the lease can be registered against title. In South Africa, differing in this respect from Zimbabwe, the consent of a mortgagee is not necessary. = Short leases = Short leases, whether oral or in writing, are effective against all others if the lessee or another holding under or through him is in occupation. Short leases are leases for a period shorter than ten years. Two approaches are possible if neither the lessee nor anyone else holding under him is in occupation: # A distinction is drawn between gratuitous and onerous successors. The rule is that, if neither the lessee nor anyone else holding under or through him is in occupation, a short lease is effective against the lessor's gratuitous successors, and also against purchasers who knew of its existence, but not against creditors of the lessor or purchasers who did not know of its existence. # Alternatively, a distinction is drawn between universal and particular successors. It is unclear how helpful the second distinction is. A universal successor is bound by all his predecessors' obligations, but there are no universal successors nowadays other than black South Africans on whom an estate devolves under customary law. Among those who are bound to recognise and continue the lease, now that the Roman-Dutch Law principle that lease takes precedence over sale (huur gaat voor koop) has been adopted, Van Leeuwen mentions purchasers and donees, while Voet lists \\"usufructuaries, legatees, donees and the like successors on particular title,\\" and says that their position is in no way distinguished from that of purchasers. This position is accepted by proponents of the universal-or-particular-successors distinction, as it has been agreed that the doctrine applies not only to purchasers of leased property, but also to gratuitous successors in title of the original lessor. Therefore, the lessee in occupation acquires a limited real right for the duration of the lease. Every successor in title will be bound by the lease. On both approaches, even if neither the lessee nor anyone else holding under or through him is in occupation, a short lease is effective against heirs, legatees, donees and other gratuitous particular successors. Purchasers are particular successors. If the universal or particular distinction is adopted, they should not be bound, but they are bound on the huur gaat voor koop principle. On the first approach, purchasers who did not know of the existence of the lease are not bound if neither the lessee nor anyone else holding under or through him is in occupation. Occupation is an outward sign to prospective purchasers that there is a lease. If the lessee does not take up occupation when he has an opportunity to do so, he has himself to blame if a purchaser is persuaded to pay the price appropriate for the property which he (the purchaser) thinks he will be able to occupy. Creditors of the lessor are in a separate class. Voet says that, in the case of long leases, their rights are preserved. This is the position in relation to long leases today. There seems to be no decision concerning their position if the lease is a short one. Professor Wille considered that creditors' rights took preference over those of a lessee who was not in occupation, but the point was left open in Kessoopersadh v Essop. See also Genna-Wae Properties v Medico-Tronics. = Unregistered long leases = In respect of unregistered long leases, the huur gaat voor koop rule applies for the first ten years of its existence. The lessee must be in occupation of the leased property. An unregistered long lease is enforceable against the new owner of the property on the basis of the doctrine of prior knowledge: that is to say, if he has prior knowledge of the lease. This is to ensure that people do not take advantage of the law to eject lessees. See De Jager v Sisana and Schwedhelm v Hauman.  Alternative common-law land-use rights  = Partiarian lease = The partiarian lease is said to be a special kind of land lease, which applies to the use of agricultural land where the owner and the lessee agree that the lessee shall farm the land against payment in the form of a certain percentage of the crop or produce. See Lubbe v Volkskas. = Labour tenants = This situation in respect of labour tenants is governed by the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act, but a person may only rely on the protection of the Act if he complies with the requirements of section 1. See Department of Land Affairs and Others v Goedgelegen Tropical Fruits and Brown v Mbhense and Another.

Roughly $5 million was stolen around the world on December 21, 2012. Success led to expansion of the crime, when an additional $40 million was stolen on February 19, 2013. The thefts included $2.4 million withdrawn from almost three thousand ATMs in New York City in a matter of hours during the February 2013 theft. Eight suspects were charged in May 2013 for the New York portion of the thefts - though one of the eight had already been found dead in the Dominican Republic, the previous month. The thefts were reported to be based on a sophisticated computer hacking procedure, whereby prepaid debit card information was stolen from the computers of financial institutions.https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/nyregion/atm-robbery-suspects- may-have-caused-own-undoing.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 The cards were then adjusted to have unlimited balances, so that gangs of criminals across the world could use the cards to withdraw the maximum amount the ATMs would allow in their target region. By using prepaid debit cards rather than customer bank cards or customer credit cards, the criminals were able to avoid the alarms or suspension-of-activity that might happen with these other types of cards.

She performed the songs \\"\\" and \\"\\" in the 1961 film The Guns of Navarone, and co-starred in the 1971 Steve McQueen film Le Mans. Together with her second husband, Peter Gimbel, she embarked on a 1981 diving expedition of the sunken . Early life She was born Helga Hymen (or Hymmen) in Dortmund, Germany. She was the only child of her parents; her father was a civil engineer. Her father enlisted with the Wehrmacht two weeks before World War II ended and was dispatched to the Russian front; he was never heard from again. Hymen dropped out of high school at age 16 and worked as an English and French interpreter to help support her and her mother. When she was 18 she moved to Paris and worked as a model. Film career She made her acting debut in Les Collegiannes, a 1957 French film directed by Andr√© Hunebelle, under the name Elga Hymen. Otto Preminger selected her for a small role in his film Bonjour Tristesse in 1958 and gave her the stage name \\"Elga Andersen\\". Her first starring role was in 1960 in Brazilian Rhapsody. Into the 1970s she appeared in many predominantly European productions. Her American productions included A Global Affair (1964), starring Bob Hope, and Le Mans (1971), in which she played opposite Steve McQueen. Andersen and McQueen reportedly had an affair during the filming. One of the Porsche 911S sports coupes used in the production was given to Andersen as partial compensation for her work in the film. Personal life Her first husband was Christian Girard, a Parisian architect. In 1978 she remarried to the American millionaire Peter R. Gimbel. In 1981 the couple engaged in a million-dollar project to try to recover the vault of the . Andersen said that their main objective was to determine why the ship sank so quickly after being struck by an ocean liner near Nantucket, Massachusetts, on July 25, 1956. At the same time, the salvage crew searched for shipboard vaults that they believed contained thousands of dollars in cash and currency. At the beginning of September 1981, after salvaging one of the vaults, the expedition members decided to end the project. The couple produced two documentaries for American television about their expedition. Andersen died of cancer on December 7, 1994. In 1995 her ashes and those of Gimbel, who had died in 1987, were interred in the Andrea Doria during a diving expedition.

The most important sights are the Alc√°zar, the Seville Cathedral, and the Archivo General de Indias (General Archive of the Indies), which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Landmarks Cathedral of St. Mary of Seville. The Giralda The Cathedral of St. Mary was built from 1401‚Äì1519 after the Reconquista on the former site of the city's mosque. It is among the largest of all medieval and Gothic cathedrals, in terms of both area and volume. The interior is the longest nave in Spain, and is lavishly decorated, with a large quantity of gold evident. The Cathedral reused some columns and elements from the mosque, and, most famously, the Giralda, originally a minaret, was converted into a bell tower. It is topped with a statue, known locally as El Giraldillo, representing Faith. The tower's interior was built with ramps rather than stairs, to allow the Muezzin and others to ride on horseback to the top. Courtyard of the Maidens in the Alc√°zar of Seville The Alc√°zar facing the cathedral was developed from a previous Moorish Palace. Construction was started in 1181 and continued for over 500 years, mainly in the Mud√©jar style, but also in the Renaissance style. Its gardens are a blend of Moorish, Renaissance, and English traditions. General Archive of the Indies The General Archive of the Indies, is the repository of extremely valuable archival documents illustrating the history of the Spanish Empire in the Americas and the Philippines. The building itself, an unusually serene and Italianate example of Spanish Renaissance architecture, was designed by Juan de Herrera. Torre del Oro (The Gold Tower) and the Guadalquivir River. The Torre del Oro was built by the Almohad dynasty as a watchtower and defensive barrier on the river. A chain was strung through the water from the base of the tower to prevent boats from travelling into the river port. Since 1944, it has housed a naval museum. The City Hall was built in the 16th century in high Plateresque style by master architect Diego de Ria√±o. The fa√ßade to Plaza Nueva was built in the 19th century in Neoclassical style. The Palace of San Telmo, formerly the University of Sailors, and later the Seminary, is now the seat for the Andalusian Autonomous Government. It is one of the most emblematic buildings of baroque architecture, mainly to its world-renowned churrigueresque principal fa√ßade and the impressive chapel. The Royal Tobacco Factory is housed on the original site of the first tobacco factory in Europe, a vast 18th-century building in Baroque style and the purported inspiration for the opera Carmen. Metropol Parasol (popularly known as The Mushrooms). The Metropol Parasol, in La Encarnaci√≥n square, is the world's largest wooden structure. A monumental umbrella-like building designed by the German architect J√ºrgen Mayer, finished in 2011. This modern architecture structure houses the central market and an underground archaeological complex. The terrace roof is a city viewpoint. The Plaza de Espa√±a, in Maria Luisa Park (Parque de Maria Luisa), was built by the architect An√≠bal Gonz√°lez for the 1929 Exposici√≥n Ibero-Americana. It is an outstanding example of Regionalist Revival Architecture, a bizarre and loftily conceived mixture of diverse historic styles, such as Art Deco and Neo-Mud√©jar and lavishly ornamented with typical glazed tiles. The neighbourhood of Triana, situated on the west bank of the Guadalquivir River, played an important role in the history of the city and constitutes by itself a folk, monumental and cultural center. On the other hand, La Macarena neighbourhood is located on the northern side of the city centre. It contains some important monuments and religious buildings, such as the Museum and Basilica of La Macarena or the Hospital de las Cinco Llagas. Museums Expo 92, today the Navigation Museum. Museum of Fine Arts of Seville The most important art collection of Seville is the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville. It was established in 1835 in the former Convent of La Merced. It holds many masterworks by Murillo, Pacheco, Zurbar√°n, Vald√©s Leal, and others masters of the Baroque Sevillian School, containing also Flemish paintings of the 15th and 16th centuries. Entry to the most of the museums in Seville is free on Mondays. Other museums in Seville are: *The Archaeological Museum, which contains collections from the Tartessian and Roman periods, placed in Am√©rica square at Mar√≠a Luisa Park. *The Museum of Arts and Traditions, also in Am√©rica square, in front of the Archaeological museum. *The Andalusian Contemporary Art Centre, placed in La Cartuja. *The Naval Museum, housed in the Torre del Oro, next to the Guadalquivir river. *The Carriages Museum, in the historic Convento de los Remedios. *The Flamenco Art Museum *The Bullfight Museum, in La Maestranza bullring *The Palace of the Countess of Lebrija, a private collection that contains many of the mosaic floors discovered in the nearby Roman town of Italica. *The \\"Centro Vel√°zquez\\" (Vel√°zquez Centre) located at the Old Priests Hospital in the turistic Santa Cruz neighbourhood. *The Antiquarium at Metropol Parasol, an underground museum that exhibits in situ Roman and Muslim remains. *The Castillo de San Jorge (Castle of St. George) remains, below the Triana market, next to Isabel II bridge. It was the last seat for the Spanish Inquisition. *The Museum and Treasure of La Macarena, where the collection of the Macarena brotherhood is exhibited. This exhibition gives visitors an accurate impression about the Seville Holy Week. Parks and gardens Monument dedicated to Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer in Mar√≠a Luisa Park Pergola in Mar√≠a Luisa Park Columbus monument (2014) in The Gardens of Murillo * The Parque de Mar√≠a Luisa (Mar√≠a Luisa Park), is a monumental park built for the 1929 World's Fair held in Seville, the Exposici√≥n Ibero-Americana. The so-called Jardines de las Delicias (literally, Delighting Gardens), closer to the river, are part of the Parque de Mar√≠a Luisa. * The Alc√°zar Gardens, within the grounds of the Alc√°zar palace, consist of several sectors developed in different historical styles. A Renaissance terrace garden fronts the space leading from the Gothic part of the palace, whereas the outermost part is an English style garden. The areas closest to the Mud√©jar buildings were kept in Moorish style. * The Gardens of Murillo and the Gardens of Catalina de Ribera, both along and outside the South wall of the Alc√°zar, lie next to the Santa Cruz quarter. They were developed from parts of the Alcazar gardens after being transferred to the City. The appearance of the gardens is due to aesthetic improvements made at the beginning of the 20th century, following classic gardening styles with a predominant Moorish Revival influence. There is a monument to Columbus, which consists of the caravel Santa Maria between two towering white columns with a lion on top. * The Parque del Alamillo y San Jer√≥nimo, the largest park in Andalusia, was originally built for Seville Expo '92 to reproduce the Andalusian native flora. It lines both Guadalquivir shores around the San Jer√≥nimo meander. The impressive 32-meters-high bronze sculpture, \\"Birth of the New World\\" (popularly known as Columbus's Egg, el Huevo de Col√≥n), by the Georgian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli, is located in its northwestern sector. Birth of the New World in the Alamillo and San Jer√≥nimo Park * The American Garden, also completed for Expo '92, is in La Cartuja. It is a public botanical garden, with a representative collection of American plants donated by different countries on the occasion of the world exposition. Despite its extraordinary botanical value, today it is a mostly abandoned place and lacks basic maintenance. Although it is not properly a park, most of the Guadalquivir's banks constitute a linear string of parks and green areas from \\"Delicias\\" bridge to the Parque del Alamillo. The Chapina green, between the Plaza de Armas bus station and the Isabel II bridge, offers a panoramic view of the Triana old quarter neighbourhood, and is a popular zone for relaxing and sunbathing. La Cartuja's rivershore has a well-developed shady river forest, panoramic piers, and floating walkways.

MC 567, folder 4.7. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. ‚Äì April 28, 1923), born Harriet Melusina Fay in Burlington, Vermont, was an American feminist, author, teacher, music critic, organizer and activist best known for spearheading the 19th century \\"cooperative housekeeping\\" movement. Peirce believed that gender equality would only come with women's economic independence and \\"identified the cause of women's economic and intellectual oppression as unpaid, unspecialized domestic work.\\" Her proposed solution to this oppression was \\"cooperative housekeeping,\\" a system in which women would do domestic chores together and profit from it by requesting payment from their husbands. An important component of her plan was the spatial reorganization of neighborhoods and homes to accommodate domestic cooperation between women. In 1869, Peirce created the Cambridge Cooperative Housekeeping Association. In addition, she was active in the Boston Woman's Education Association and the Cambridge Woman's Union and promoted the founding of Radcliffe College. Peirce was also the president of the Woman's Parliament's first convention, which met in New York in 1869. She championed causes besides feminism as well, such as street cleaning and historic preservation, leading initiatives to address these issues. In 1887‚Äì1888, she organized the street cleaning committee of the Ladies' Health Protective Association of New York, and in 1900‚Äì1901, she organized the Women's Auxiliary to the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. Peirce also spearheaded \\"the New York Women's World Fair committee [in] 1876; the New York women's movement for cheap summer-night concerts [in] 1895; [and] the New York movement to save the Poe cottage [in] 1896; and Fraunces Tavern [in] 1897\\".Brown, John Howard. Lamb's Biographical Dictionary of the United States. Boston: James H. Lamb Company, 1900. California Digital Library. Web. 14 May 2013. p. 200. In 1898‚Äì1899, she organized the Women's Philharmonic Society of New York. Her writings appear in the Atlantic Monthly, the Boston Post, and the Chicago Evening Journal. She wrote Cooperative Housekeeping: How not to do it, and How to do it: A Study in Sociology (1884), Cooperative Housekeeping (1889), and New York, A Symphonic Study. She also edited Music-Study in Germany (1881), written by her sister Amy Fay.  Family, ancestry and early life  On February 24, 1836, Peirce was born in Burlington, Vermont in her grandfather Right Reverend John Henry Hopkins's house. She was of English, French, German, and Irish backgroundSylvia Wright Mitarachi Papers, 1834-1990; The Life of Melusina Fay Peirce, final typescript, pages 1‚Äì100; includes notes and work by Susana Robbins, 1990, MC 567, folder 1.1. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. At age four, Peirce began learning to sew, but openly expressed her distaste for it. By age eight, however, Peirce was an obedient, \\"dutiful and conscientious,\\" Christian child. According to her mother, young Peirce was \\"above the common grade of children of her age [and] mature in Christian principle and self-government.\\" Young Peirce was also a writer. When she was eight-years-old, Peirce wrote \\"On Temptation\\" and \\"On Carelessness,\\" two personal documents decorated with ornate calligraphy that showcased her religious upbringing: ;;;On Temptation ;;;On Carelessness According to her sister Amy Fay, Peirce played the melodeon, as well as hymn tunes in her father's church starting at age nine. At 19, Fay wrote to Ralph Waldo Emerson, strongly criticizing his Unitarianism. Peirce's father was Dr. Reverend Charles Hopkins Fay (1808‚Äì1888), an Episcopal bishop from Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Reverend married twice in his lifetime, to Sophronia Adams White and to Emily Hopkins Fay.Ancestry.com. \\"Charlotte Emily Hopkins.\\" Ancestry.com. n.d. Web. 9 May 2013. His parents were Judge Samuel Phillips Prescott and Harriet (Howard) Fay. Peirce's mother was Emily Hopkins Fay (May 4, 1817 ‚Äì September 23, 1856), whose maiden name was Charlotte C. Hopkins. Emily was born in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, but also had significant ties to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. One of thirteen children, she was forced by her clergyman father to quit school at fourteen. Emily would go on to become a severely overworked housewife. She died at age 39 in St. Albans, Vermont. The toil that plagued her life instilled in Peirce an ardent desire to improve the lives of housewives. Emily's parents were the Right Reverend John Henry Hopkins and Melusina (Muller) Hopkins. Right Reverend John Henry Hopkins was the first bishop of Vermont. One of nine children, Peirce had six sisters, including Amy Fay (a pianist), Rose Emily Fay, Laura Matilda Fay, Amelia Muller Fay, Katherine Maria Fay, and Lily Valeria Fay. Her brothers were Alfred St. John Fay, Herman Theophilus Fay, and Charles Norman Fay. Peirce's predecessors included John Fay, Anne Hutchinson and Caroline Howard Gilman.  Education  As a child, Peirce studied in schools run by her parents in the various towns she lived in, including Montpelier, Georgia; Bayou Goula and New Orleans, Louisiana; and St. Albans, Vermont. \\"As well as the usual reading, writing, and arithmetic, her studies included Latin, French, and drawing, and a great deal of music. She played the piano, the organ, trained choirs, and sang alto\\". She also taught in these schools. Two weeks after the death of her mother in September 1856, Peirce was in contact with Ralph Waldo Emerson, who recommended that she attend the Young Ladies' School of Professor Louis Agassiz in Cambridge. In November 1859, she started school there, where she studied \\"science, philosophy, literature, history, and other subjects usually well outside of the educational limits for young women, even of her class\\". She also developed a liking for scientific thinkingElbert, Monika Maria. Separate Spheres No More: Gender Convergence in American Literature, 1830-1930. University of Alabama Press, 2000. Print. p. 182. and was an exemplary student. Peirce graduated in the summer of 1861, when she gave the graduation speech. Peirce would go on to consider herself a sociologist.  Later years  Melusina Fay married Charles Sanders Peirce in the early 1860s, but separated from him in 1876 and divorced him in the early 1880s. Following the failure of her cooperative housing experiment, Peirce continued to advocate the \\"cooperative housekeeping\\" cause, traveling to London and Berlin to meet with European champions of cooperation. Peirce was also involved in a number of talks, in which she spoke about new insights gathered during her trip abroad, as well as views on \\"womanhood\\" suffrage. On October 4, 1876, Peirce spoke at the Fourth Woman's Congress in Philadelphia about what she had learned about cooperation in Europe. In 1880, Peirce spoke at the Illinois Social Science Association, where she advocated the creation of a \\"Woman's House\\" as an alternative to the United States Senate.  Death  On April 28, 1923, Peirce died of chronic arthritis and valvular heart disease in her home in Watertown, Massachusetts. She was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Watertown two days later.

It is referred to as the Dependent Origination DhƒÅra·πáƒ´. These words were used by the Arahat Assaji (Skr: A≈õvajit) when asked about the teaching of the Buddha. On the spot Sariputta (Skt: ≈öƒÅriputra) attained the first Path (SotƒÅpatti) and later told them to his friend MoggallƒÅna (Skt: Maudgalyayana) who also attained. They then went to the Buddha, along with 500 of their disciples, and asked to become his disciples.Text and Translation of their story: http://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Texts-and- Translations/Mahakhandhako/41-Sariputta-Moggallana.htm Original Sanskrit text The Dependent Origination DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ in Ranjana and Tibetan scripts ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§π‡•á‡§§‡•Å-‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§µ‡§æ ‡§π‡•á‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§§‡§•‡§æ‡§ó‡§§‡•ã ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§¶‡§§‡•ç ‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§ö ‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß ‡§è‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§£ Transliterations In Roman transliteration this dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ is variously transliterated, depending on the language it was written in.

Meaning The meaning is: Of those phenomena which arise from causes: Those causes have been taught by the TathƒÅgata (Buddha), And their cessation too - thus proclaims the Great Ascetic.  Pali version  Ye Dharma Hetu has been found in Pali Canon of Tripitaka as shown in Maha Vag section of Vinaya Pitaka at Verse No. 68 with the same meaning as sanskrit version as shown here: ye dhammƒÅ hetuppabhavƒÅ tesa·πÉ hetu·πÉ tathƒÅgato (ƒÅha) tesa√±ca yo nirodho eva·πÉvƒÅdƒ´ mahƒÅsama·πáoti. The PƒÅ·∏∑i commentaries take the first line as pointing to suffering (dukkha), the second to its cause (samudaya) and the third to its cessation (nirodha). Miniature Chaityas The mantra has been widely used. It has been used at Sarnath, Tirhut, Kanari Copperplate, Tagoung, Sherghatti, near Gaya, Allahabad column, Sanchi etc. On Buddha images The mantra was often also carved below the images of the Buddha.

On September 4, a tropical cyclone developed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico near the Bay of Campeche. Moving slowly in a general westward direction, the disturbance reached hurricane intensity on September 7 prior to making landfall south of Tampico, Mexico the following day. The storm weakened over land, and lost cyclonic characteristics later that day. However, a nearby high-pressure area forced the remnants of the system northward into Texas. Due to an orographic lifting effect, the remnants were able to produce torrential and record rainfall over the state. Precipitation peaked over Central Texas, where the highest rainfall amount measured was 40 in (1,016 mm) near Thrall, Texas; this was the fourth-highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall total in Texas since record keeping began. Similarly, an observation of 36.40 in (925 mm) elsewhere in Williamson County, Texas ranked as the sixth-highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall total for the state. The high precipitation totals set nationwide records which would stand for several years. Meteorological history In early September, a trough of low-pressure persisted in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, near the Bay of Campeche. The area of disturbed weather gradually organized, and was analyzed to have become a tropical depression by 1200 UTC on September 4\\\\. In its initial stages after tropical cyclogenesis, the disturbance moved very slowly and did not intensify. Its lack of organization resulted in its estimated misplacement inland over Mexico in the Signal Corps's weather map for September 5. At the time, the storm was estimated to have a minimum barometric pressure of at least 1010 mbar (hPa; 29.83 inHg). The system remained a tropical depression until 0000 UTC on September 6, when it was estimated to have attained tropical storm intensity. Despite the analyzed intensification, the updated Signal Corps weather maps for the tropical cyclone that day indicated that the system had degenerated back into an open trough. Continuing to intensify throughout the day, the tropical storm was estimated to have reached hurricane intensity by the following day. Shortly after, the hurricane made landfall south of Tampico, Mexico near La Leja at 0300 UTC on September 7. At the time, the cyclone had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), making it a Category 1 on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The storm's minimum barometric pressure at landfall was 985 mbar (hPa; 29.10 inHg); this would be the lowest pressure estimated in association with the storm, though it was not included in HURDAT. Just prior to landfall at 0100 UTC, a ship had reported winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) from the southeast and a pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; 29.42 inHg). Upon landfall, a barometer in Tampico reported a minimum pressure of 1003 mbar (hPa; 29.62 inHg). The Signal Corps map of the cyclone for September 7 indicated a pressure of at least 1007.5 mbar (hPa; 29.75 inHg) for the storm's outermost closed isobar, with a storm of similar nature positioned a short distance west of Jalisco, Mexico in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Once inland, the hurricane weakened, and made a northward curve before degenerating into a remnant low after 0600 UTC on September 8\\\\. The remnant low progressed northward, and moved into Texas from the state border with Mexico near Webb County. In Texas, moisture associated with the system and other contributing forces produced excessive rainfall over Central Texas, causing numerous rivers to overflow. Impact alt=Colored map of rainfall totals as represented by filled contours Despite making landfall on Tamaulipas, its impact in Mexico, if any, remains unknown. However, the decaying remnants of the hurricane moved northward as the result of a retrograding high-pressure area over East Texas, helping to produce torrential precipitation across South and Central Texas. The area of high-pressure was a westward extension of the Bermuda High, which is typically centered in the Central Atlantic. The pressure anomaly provided an abundant moisture supply to the region, increasing convergence. In addition, a separate tropical cyclone located near Barbados was able to alter the positioning of isobars over the area, such that heavy rainfall would result. Precipitation was further aided by the Balcones Escarpment and Edwards Plateau, which provided orographic lift. The rains caused severe flooding, particularly to low-lying areas. Due to the rapid accumulation of floodwaters, the United States Weather Bureau issued numerous flood warnings. The first warnings pertinent to the storm system were issued early on September 9 for areas adjacent to the Rio Grande between Rio Grande City and Brownsville. While the warnings for the Rio Grande were discontinued shortly after, areas near the Colorado River downstream of Austin were issued a flood warning on September 10\\\\. At the same time, flood warnings were posted for areas of the Brazos River from Valley Junction to Richmond; this specific warning was later extended further downstream to include Freeport. Similar warnings were issued for portions near the lower Guadalupe River on September 11\\\\. All warnings were later discontinued after the floods ended. Despite being effected by the floods, warnings were not issued for areas of the Nueces, San Antonio, and Little Rivers, due to a lack of river services. Though peak rainfall estimates have been widely disputed, it has been most recently estimated that the peak precipitation amount in Texas associated with the storm to have been a recording of 40 in (1016 mm) in Thrall over a three-day period; this would make the storm the fourth wettest tropical cyclone to impact Texas since record keeping began. The same station had observed 38.20 in (971 mm) of precipitation in a 24-hour period, as well as 32 in (813 mm) of rain in just 12 hours; this would be a national record. Similarly, another location in Williamson County reported 36.40 in (925 mm) of rain in 18 hours, which would be a national record for most amount of rainfall in its respective period. In Thrall, the extreme rainfall washed out numerous roads and created deep gullies into the ground. In nearby Thorndale, rains estimated as high as 25 in (635 mm) caused streams to overflow, reaching levels unseen since the 1900 Galveston hurricane. Map of rainfall in the San Antonio area When the remnants of the hurricane moved into Texas, they first impacted parts of the Rio Grande. Though rainfall was not considerable, a station in Laredo, which straddles the river, reported 6 in (152 mm) of precipitation. There, the river rose by 8.6 ft (2.6 mm). Since rainfall was mostly concentrated upstream of the mouth of the Rio Grande, the resulting river rises caused a wave of high water which pushed downstream. In Rio Grande City, the river rose 3 ft (0.9 m) above flood stage, though no damage resulted. Further north, the drainage basin of the Guadalupe River saw torrential rainfall and flooding. High precipitation observations in the drainage basin include 11.50 in (292 mm) in San Marcos, 9.56 in (243 mm) in New Braunfels, and 7.85 in (199 mm) in Blanco. In Gonzales, the Guadalupe River peaked at a crest of 31.4 ft (9.57 m), 9.4 ft (2.87 m) above flood stage on September 11\\\\. The unusually high crest damaged adjacent low-lying corn crops. Damages to Gonzales County totaled to $3,500. Though damage along the river was minor, damage due to the rain in Blanco, Hays, Comal, and Guadalupe Counties was estimated at $218,500. Rainfall was most concentrated around the Colorado River, particularly from September 9‚Äì10. The highest rainfall amount reported along the river was 19.03 in (483 mm) in Austin. There, the river rose by 18.2 ft (462 mm). Although the river itself did not cause any damage in the city, its creek tributaries caused severe devastation. Flood in Austin was estimated at $850,000, mostly to the city's road network. Squalls and other thunderstorms caused an additional $30,000 in damages in Austin and Creedmoor. The excess floodwaters moved downstream, inundating low-lying areas. In Smithville, the rising water levels submerged areas up to 2 mi (3 km) outwards from the river. Damages there were estimated at $8,000. Further south in La Grange, damage to crops, livestock, and property was valued at $17,250, though it was estimated that $20,000 in damages was mitigated by flood warnings. Losses to the corn crop were increased since the ground in the area was already highly saturated. Overall, the floods associated with the remnant tropical cyclone caused $19 million in property losses, particularly in the counties of Bell, Bexar, Milam, Travis, and Williamson. The floods also killed 215 people, greatly exceeding the 117 caused by floods in Texas in December 1913. Aftermath The floods would spur the construction of Olmos Dam and a bypass channel in Downtown San Antonio. The original plans called for the bypass channel to be followed by creation of a paved-over storm sewer along a prominent bend of the river. However, that option was unpopular. Later, local architect Robert Hugman developed plans for commercial development of the bend, which ultimately became the world-famous San Antonio River Walk.

Bloss (1930 ‚Äì June 6, 1995) was a scientist known for his work in the field of photovoltaics. He was the director of the Institute of Physical Electronics at the University of Stuttgart.  Biography  Werner H. Bloss studied Physics at the University of T√ºbingen and the University of Stuttgart. In 1955 he took the position of a research assistant at the Institute of Gas Discharge Techniques and Photoelectronics at the University of Stuttgart. Here he came into contact with various methods of energy conversion. In his doctoral thesis he described the noble gas filled thermionic converter developed by him. In the early sixties, very successful research work on various types of thermionic converters was performed under his guidance at the above-mentioned institute. In the autumn of 1967 he took a position as Associate Professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida. During his two-year stay in the United States his field of interest widened again to take in optical methods of image processing. After returning from the US he implemented this novel field of research at the institute in Stuttgart. On October 1, 1970, Dr. Bloss became the director of his institute at the University of Stuttgart. He renamed it \\"Institute of Physical Electronics\\" (IPE).

It was founded in 2005 by the CEO and Chairman of the organization, Mo Islam. The association is based in Stevenage, United Kingdom. It was recognised by Sport England as the national governing body of dodgeball in the UK until 2018.  League Activity  Premier League The Premier League was established in 2010. The six highest ranked teams in the UK competed over six weeks in the inaugural season. Jammy Dodgers claimed the title seeing off Warwick Warriors, Leicester City Ligers, Balls of Steel, Vipers and Derby Seahawks. Season 2 saw the league expanded to eight teams and it was Bedford Bulls, one of the promoted sides, who stormed to the title in a dramatic final week. Derby Seahawks claimed the 2012/13 title winning 11 out of their 14 matches over the five-week season. The league expanded again for the 2013/14 season, increasing to 10 teams. Going into the final week of the season Dirty Ducks lead Meteors at the top of the table by 1 point. In the final week The Meteors went on to win the 2013/14 title by the narrowest of margins. The 2014/15 season was also very close but newly promoted Bedford Mighty Eagles clinched the title with Meteors falling runners up by just two points. National League The National League is the second tier of UK dodgeball from which teams are promoted annually to the Premier League. The first season, 2010/11, saw every team outside the Premier League divided into four regional conferences. Teams were ranked based on tournament performances throughout the season, with the top two teams from each conference qualifying for the play-offs. Bedford Bulls claimed promotion alongside play-off winners Meteors. The 2011/12 season saw a change in format with the creation of an eight-team Division 1 in a traditional league setup. Division 2 was also set up in this season, running a similar setup to the National League in 2010/11 season, with four conferences divided between university and club teams and regional, North and South. Reepham Raiders claimed the Division 1 title and promotion alongside runners-up Imperial Wolverines. Division 2 play-offs were won by Bullet Dodgers beating fellow promoted side Winchester Bullets in the play-off final. Fellows Appreciation Society claimed the Division 1 title in 2012/13 season, winning promotion alongside Bullet Dodgers. Balls of Steel reclaimed their Premier League place in a relegation/promotion play-off game against Leicester City Ligers. Fellows Appreciation Society allowed club mates Dirty Ducks to take their place in the Premier League. Division 2 Play-offs were won by Bedford Mighty Eagles, with all teams that made the play-offs getting promoted due to the league restructure. In the 2013/14 season, the National League was restructured. Division 1 and 2 were split into three regional conferences of five teams, North, South West and South East. In Division 1 the top two from each conference win a place in the promotion play- off for the two Premier League places, the bottom two from each conferences enter the relegation play-offs with the bottom three being relegated into Division 2. In Division 2 the top two from each conference win a place in the promotion play-off for the three Division 1 places, the bottom two from each conferences enter the play-offs to avoid being relegated into non-league.  University League  As mentioned above, there is a University Premier League and in addition there runs a University League 1, divided into North and South. Women's Premier League In 2013 the Women's Premier League was created. The six highest ranked teams in the UK competed over five weeks in the inaugural season. Bedford Mighty Eagles claimed the title with one week remaining, seeing off Leicester City Ligeresses, Southampton Dodgettes, Leeds Dodge Ladies, Derby Seahawks Women and Bedfoedshire Bulls Women. Leicester League Leicester League is a county league comprising Bullet Dodgers, Leicester City Ligers, Leicester Minotaurs, Hinckley Dodgeball Club, Hinckley Revolution. Social & Fun League The Social & Fun League is run in London by an organization called GoMammoth.

He is an original character and has no counterpart in the British version of the series. Clark, along with Pete Miller, is one of two staff members hired as customer service representatives at the Scranton branch of fictitious paper distributor Dunder Mifflin, replacing the outgoing Kelly Kapoor and Ryan Howard at the start of the show's ninth and final season. Biography Little has been established about Clark's backstory, apart from his admitting he had \\"gigantic inner ears\\" which prove useful when keeping balance when slacklining. His and Pete's vague resemblance to salesmen Dwight Schrute and Jim Halpert led to several office staff members initially referring to them as \\"Dwight Jr.\\" and \\"New Jim,\\" respectively, though Clark would prove to have little in common with Dwight. Season 9 Clark and Pete are introduced in \\"New Guys\\" as the new Customer Service Representatives. Several co-workers note their resemblance to Jim and Dwight, dubbing them \\"New Jim\\" and \\"New Dwight\\". Dwight initially took to Clark as a surrogate son (due to his disappointment at apparently not being the father of Angela Martin's baby), but when Clark attempted to use this to persuade Dwight to give Clark some of his sale leads, Dwight came to see Clark as a threat (a fear Jim would stoke for his own amusement). Clark later upstaged Dwight by managing to balance on a slackline, something Dwight was unable to do. In \\"Roy's Wedding\\", Clark attempted to trick receptionist Erin Hannon into recording herself on camera in a series of revealing outfits, supposedly for a news anchor audition. Though Erin's then-boyfriend and Clark's boss Andy Bernard quickly found out, he too was fooled and even gave Clark his credit card and instructed Clark to take Erin shopping for outfits. Pete, however, quickly saw through the ruse, and, not wanting to see Erin exploited, convinced Andy to come along to read along with her, ruining Clark's plans. To add insult to injury, Andy had Pete take Erin out to eat, leaving him alone to \\"audition\\" more. In \\"Andy's Ancestry\\", Pete and Clark immediately applaud at the news that Andy may be distantly related to Michelle Obama, having learned that Andy appreciates enthusiasm, and therefore have learned to clap for almost any action or announcement. In \\"Work Bus\\" the entire staff is confined to work on a bus rented by Dwight while the office undergoes renovations. When the staff take the bus out to get pies, Clark and Darryl Philbin are left behind, something which doesn't bother either of them. In a deleted scene, Darryl then bothers Clark with questions about operating computers. In \\"Here Comes Treble\\", Clark applauds enthusiastically when the a cappella group from Andy's alma mater of Cornell performs \\"Car Wash\\". In a deleted scene Clark did not appear in \\"The Boat\\". In \\"The Whale\\" he grows a mustache with Pete and several other male co-workers for \\"Movember\\" at the suggestion of Toby Flenderson. Clark is later summoned by Dwight to the office of Jan Levinson at the Scranton White Page, to help Dwight make a sale. Clark is eager to become a salesman, but in fact Dwight intended to set him up with Jan, knowing she had a taste for younger men. The two apparently then traveled to Europe for several weeks, leaving him absent for the next three episodes. Clark returns to Scranton in \\"Suit Warehouse\\". He compares his sexual encounter with Jan to \\"a swarm of bees... bees that find something wrong with every hotel room\\". He also presents the office with an espresso machine from Jan, something which causes hyperactivity among most of the staff after they try the various flavors. Clark, meanwhile, accompanies Dwight on a sales call to Stone and Sons Suit Warehouse, posing as father and son. In \\"Customer Loyalty\\", Dwight, attempting to prevent Darryl from leaving to work at Athlead, instructs Clark to bring up any complaint files on Darryl by keyword. Clark tells Dwight he's \\"kinda dreaming\\", pointing out the computers run on Windows 95, with dot matrix printers. In \\"Junior Salesman\\", Clark hears that Dwight will be hiring a junior sales associate to cover for Jim and urges Dwight to choose him, reminding him he helped Dwight get accounts with Stone and Sons and the Scranton White Pages. Dwight agrees to give him an interview, but has no intention of giving him the job, intending to give the job to one of his various friends. Jim, not wanting Pam to have to sit with one of Dwight's friends, helps him give an excellent interview (which is made easier by the fact that even Dwight acknowledges that none of his friends he brought in to interview were qualified). Dwight ultimately chooses Clark. In \\"Vandalism\\", Dwight and Pam Beesly send Clark down to the warehouse as a spy to find something to use against warehouse worker Frank who had vandalized Pam's mural. Clark is certain no one will believe him and is proven right when he's stripped and tied up with duct tape by the warehouse workers. In \\"Couples Discount\\" the entire staff skips work to go to the mall on Valentine's Day, with Clark and Nellie Bertram posing as a couple to get a couples' discount. When Nellie teases him in front of women at a salon, however, an irritated Clark drops the ruse. In \\"Moving On\\", Clark was one of the few people who initially knew Pete and Erin had begun dating in secret after Erin broke up with Andy. Clark seemed amused at the awkward situation, particularly after Andy, upon finding out, retaliated by hiring Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice to cause him discomfort. In \\"The Farm\\", Clark and the rest of the staff end up eating cupcakes from Todd Packer laced with laxatives and hallucinogens. In \\"Promos\\", he assisted Dwight in determining if his new girlfriend Esther was taking advantage of him. In \\"Paper Airplane\\", Clark competes against Erin in a paper airplane throwing contest. Both Clark and Pete are taken aback when this sets off a highly competitive streak in Erin. In \\"Stairmageddon\\", Clark reluctantly helps Dwight move an incapacitated Stanley Hudson to help on a sales call. In \\"Livin' the Dream\\", Clark refuses to give back Jim's seat when he returns. A newly promoted Dwight sends Clark back to the annex, however In \\"A.A.R.M.\\", Clark, along with the rest of the staff, is dismayed when Darryl (who is quitting to work at Athlead full-time) attempts to leave without saying goodbye. Clark expresses an interest in \\"recording some of (his) stories... just let the tape roll for six, eight, or ten hours, see what we get.\\" He's later seen dancing with staff after Darryl agrees to one last activity together. He's later seen with the others at Poor Richard's, watching the airing of the documentary. Relationships Pete Miller Despite being roughly the same age, working in the same department, and being hired at the same time, Pete explicitly states in \\"Roy's Wedding\\" that Clark is not his friend, but is merely \\"the douche that sits next to me at the office\\". He clearly disapproves of Clark's attempt to exploit Erin with a fake news audition in that episode and successfully foils it. There has not been any apparent tension between the two since then, however, and the two do agree on several things, such as how to behave around Andy. The two were seen playing QWOP together in \\"New Guys\\". In \\"The Whale\\" the two were seen hanging out with Toby Flenderson, Darryl Philbin, and Kevin Malone, all having grown mustaches for \\"Movember\\". Clark was apparently aware that Pete and Erin had been dating before anyone else in the office. He appeared somewhat amused at Pete's awkwardness around Andy before Andy found out, and later found it funny when Andy later hired Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice to work with him to get back at him. Pete and Clark's relationship has apparently improved over time. When Clark takes Jim's desk, briefly relegating Jim to Clark's desk in the annex, Jim suggests to Pete that he probably missed Clark, which Pete seems to acknowledge. Clark, for his part, sardonically warns Jim \\"it is very easy to get lost in Pete's beautiful, dead eyes.\\" Andy Bernard Both Pete and Clark are largely deferential to Branch Manager Andy Bernard, not having known him before his promotion, unlike most of the other staff. When Pete is first introduced to Andy in \\"New Guys\\", Andy assigns him the nickname \\"Plop\\", much to Pete's discomfort, because Andy claims Pete is \\"always taking dumps\\". The nickname would persist even after Andy quit. In \\"Andy's Ancestry\\", Pete and Clark have taken to applauding nearly any announcement or action by Andy, however mundane, after discovering that Andy appreciates enthusiasm. The two note in a talking head that their applause is beginning to have a reverse effect, causing them to genuinely believe simple actions like making copies or drinking water are impressive. Reception Clark Duke, one of two additions to the cast for the show's final seasons was met with mixed responses at first. Myles McNutt found the storyline in \\"Roy's Wedding\\" somewhat awkward. \\"I raise this point not because I dislike Pete and Clark, but rather because I actually sort of enjoy them, and wonder how the show is going to manage their tenuous position as it relates to the series‚Äô narrative. Clark Duke continues his streak of characters that turn out to be creepy sexual predators, and Jake Lacey is likeable playing the second string Jim, but it feels weird for one part of the show to be invested in exploring characters‚Äô lives when another part of the show is deploying newly introduced characters to play out the kind of stock sitcom fare the show has done a dozen times over.\\" Over time, however, responses grew more favorable. Of his performance in \\"Stairmageddon\\", Joseph Kratzer said \\" I contend that the strength of this story was carried most predominantly by Clark Duke. I‚Äôve mentioned on several occasions how talented Duke is at just nailing the odd comedic timing necessary to really reach the full potential of The Office‚Äôs writing, and this episode is a perfect example. His reluctance in helping Dwight from the scene in the break room just before Dwight fires off the bull tranquilizers at Stanley (‚ÄúCan I just get out of here before whatever comes next?‚Äù) to trying to load the bubble-wrapped man into Dwight‚Äôs car (‚ÄúUse the vernacular I‚Äôm comfortable with!‚Äù) was the exact performance needed to offset the all too familiar ludicrous behavior of Dwight. We all know that the ninth season is the final one of the series, but it‚Äôs sort of pleasantly bittersweet to know that if in another world NBC did renew the show for at least one more, it would have a suitable heir to John Krasinski‚Äôs deadpan throne.\\" References  External links  * Clark Duke at NBC.com Category:The Office (American TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Clark Green"},{"id":"39372617","text":"Picture Page was an early Australian television series which aired from 1956 to 1957 on ABC.

HMS Versatile (D32) was an Admiralty V-class destroyer of the British Royal Navy that saw service in World War I, the Russian Civil War, and World War II. Construction and commissioning Versatile, the first Royal Navy ship of the name, was ordered on 30 June 1916 as part of the 9th Order of the 1916‚Äì17 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 31 January 1917 by Hawthorn Leslie and Company at Tyneside, England, and launched on 31 October 1917. She was completed on 11 February 1918 and commissioned into service the same day. Her original pennant number, F29, was later changed to G10 and became D32 during the interwar period. Service history World War I All V- and W-class destroyers, Versatile among them, were assigned to the Grand Fleet or Harwich Force. Versatile saw service in the last year of World War I. Interwar years During 1919, Versatile took part in the British campaign against Bolshevik forces in the Baltic Sea during the Russian Civil War. Ferguson, Harry, Operation Kronstadt: The Greatest True Story of Honor, Espionage, and the Rescue of Britains Greatest Spy, The Man with a Hundred Faces, New York: Overlook Press, 2010, , pp. 109, 111. Sailors of the ship took part in the Royal Navy mutiny of 1919. She then served in the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Atlantic Fleet. On 23 March 1922, Versatile was steaming off Europa Point, Gibraltar, at 20 knots with other destroyers while British submarines practised attacks on them.Navy Net: Remembrance Sunday: H42 is Still On Patrol The submarine surfaced unexpectedly only 30 or 120 yards (27 or 110 meters) ‚Äì sources differ ‚Äì ahead of her. Versatile went to full speed astern on her engines and put her helm over hard to port, but had not yet begun to answer her helm when she rammed H42 abaft the conning tower, almost slicing the submarine in half. H42 sank with the loss of all hands. An investigation found H42 at fault for surfacing where she did against instructions.Richardson, Alexander and Archibald Hurd, eds. Brasseys Naval and Shipping Annual 1923, London: William Clowes, 1923, p. 31. In 1931, Versatile joined her flotilla in a three-week cruise to various ports on the Baltic Sea.holywellhousepublishing.co.uk A HARD FOUGHT SHIP: The story of HMS Venomous: As the clouds gather ... In October 1936, she was decommissioned, transferred to the Reserve Fleet, and placed in reserve at the Nore. With tensions between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany rising, the Royal Navy recommissioned Versatile in 1939. World War II =1939‚Äì1940= When the United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939, Versatile deployed with the 11th Destroyer Flotilla for convoy defence duty in the Southwestern Approaches and North Atlantic Ocean, based at Plymouth. She and the destroyer escorted Convoy OB 1 on 8 September 1939, and on 15 September 1939 she, Vimy, and the destroyer escorted Convoy OB 5; both convoys were carrying troops and equipment of the British Expeditionary Force from the United Kingdom to France. On 3 February 1940, she joined the destroyers and and the sloop as they briefly escorted Convoy OG 17F during the first hours of its voyage from the United Kingdom to Gibraltar. She performed a similar duty for Gibraltar- bound Convoy OG 18F on 11 February 1940 with the sloops and . From 12 to 15 February 1940, Versatile joined Enchantress, the sloop , the minesweeper , and the submarine as the escort for Convoy HG 18F during the final leg of its voyage from Gibraltar to Liverpool. In May 1940 ‚Äì the month in which her pennant number was changed to I32 ‚Äì Versatile was detached from convoy duty after escorting Convoy OB 144 and, after refuelling at Plymouth, was assigned to operations related to the evacuation of Allied personnel from the Netherlands, Belgium, and France in the face of the successful German offensive there. On 12 May 1940 she ran aground on the Dutch coast but was towed off by the destroyer . Early on 13 May 1940, Versatile arrived off the Hook of Holland to take part in Operation Ordnance, the evacuation of Allied personnel from that port. That evening, she was underway in the North Sea as an escort for the destroyer , upon which Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands was embarked for passage to Breskens, when German aircraft attacked at 20:45 hours. One bomb struck Versatiles upper deck, causing her engine room to flood, and splinters from that bomb and several near misses killed nine men, fatally injured another, wounded a third of her crew, and damaged her steam pipe, causing her to go dead in the water. The destroyer towed her to Sheerness, England, for repairs.BBC WW2: People's War After completing repairs in June 1940, Versatile was assigned to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla at Sheerness and began convoy duty in the English Channel and Southwestern Approaches. On 27 June 1940, about 150 nautical miles (278 km) west of Ushant, France, at , she rescued 13 of the 40 survivors of the Royal Navy special service vessel , a submarine decoy vessel or \\"Q-ship\\" which the German submarine had sunk on 21 June 1940 at with the loss of 56 lives.uboat.net Ships Hit By U-boats: HMS Prunella (X 02) In July 1940, Versatiles duties expanded to include anti-invasion patrols as the threat of a German invasion of the United Kingdom grew. She came under air attack again on 3 July, avoiding damage, and again escaped damage on 10 July when German aircraft attacked a convoy she was escorting in the English Channel off Dungeness, although one ship of the convoy was sunk. She had frequent encounters with German aircraft through August 1940. On 25 August 1940, Versatile and Vimy were transferred to the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands and on 31 August 1940 were ordered to raise steam to intercept a German naval force reported to have shelled Eastbourne on Englands east coast. In early September Versatile escorted Convy BAS 31 from the River Clyde to Iceland and received orders en route to alter course to avoid a reported German invasion force bound for Iceland. On 11 September 1940, she, Vimy, and the destroyer escorted the auxiliary minelayers , , , and of the 1st Minelaying Squadron as they laid mines in the Southwestern Approaches in Operation SN41, after which Versatile remained on convoy duty around Scotland for the rest of September. On 30 September, she cooperated with a Royal Air Force Avro Anson aircraft in a search for a German submarine after the merchant ship Fort George reported sighting a periscope. From 3 to 5 October 1940, Versatile was part of the escort of Convoy WS 3A Slow during the portion of its voyage that took place in the Southwestern Approaches, joining the destroyer in screening the passenger liner Highland Brigade. During this activity, her Asdic and degaussing coil both failed, and the following day she began to experience serious oil leaks into her living spaces. After undergoing temporary repairs at Derry (also called Londonderry) in Northern Ireland, on 10 October 1940, she proceeded to the River Tyne for a refit and repairs. =1941‚Äì1942= Upon completion of her refit, Versatile returned to escort duty in the Southwestern Approaches. Almost all the convoys she escorted came under German air attack. On 27 January 1941, her steering gear failed in the English Channel while she was operating near merchant ships in rough waters and with little manoeuvring room, but she managed to avoid a collision with the ships she was escorting. In February 1941, Versatile was transferred to Harwich for convoy defence duty in the North Sea. She was in action along with the destroyer and corvette with German motor torpedo boats ‚Äì S-boats, known to the Allies as \\"E-boats\\" ‚Äì in the North Sea off Lowestoft on 6 March 1941 while escorting Convoy FN 26. On 13 March 1941, she attacked a submarine contact. She reported on 14 March 1941 that the merchant ship Hereport had struck a mine and sunk, and she rescued 11 survivors and took them to Sheerness; that evening, a German S boat attacked her unsuccessfully. She reported on 16 March that the merchant ship Mexico had struck a mine and sunk, and on 26 March she shot down a German Messerschmitt Bf 110 that attacked a convoy she was escorting in the North Sea. For the rest of 1941 and throughout 1942, Versatile escorted convoys in the North Sea, defending them against frequent German air attacks. She was \\"adopted\\" by the civil community of Tipton in Staffordshire in a Warship Week fundraising campaign in February 1942. On 12 February 1942, she was one of the few British warships able to respond to the \\"Channel Dash\\" of the German battleships and and heavy cruiser from Brest, France, to Germany via the English Channel, Strait of Dover, and North Sea. =1943‚Äì1945= Near the end of 1942, the Royal Navy selected Versatile for conversion into a long-range escort, and in January 1943 she left her North Sea duties and entered the shipyard of the Grangemouth Dockyard Company at Grangemouth, Scotland, for conversion. After its completion and passing her post-conversion sea trials, Versatile was assigned to the 7th Escort Group in September 1943 and began convoy escort duty in the Western Approaches. She continued in this role until April 1944, when she was selected for service in Force J in support of the upcoming Allied invasion of Normandy, scheduled for early June 1944. In May 1944 she took part in exercises with Force J in the English Channel to prepare for the invasion. In early June 1944, Versatile deployed in The Solent with Force J to escort convoys to the invasion beaches, and she and a Royal Navy Coastal Forces motor launch joined Convoy J 14 ‚Äì consisting of the infantry landing ship , 12 infantry landing craft, 24 tank landing craft, two antiaircraft landing craft, one rocket tank landing craft, and one United States Coast Guard vessel ‚Äì as its escort on 4 June 1944. The invasion was postponed from 5 to 6 June due to bad weather, but on 5 June Convoy J 14 began its voyage to Juno Beach, arriving at its launch point on 6 June 1944 half an hour before the landings. On 7 June, Versatile embarked Rear Admiral William G. Tennant, who was in command of the Mulberry harbour operation and of the undersea pipeline effort known as Operation Pluto, to witness the sinking of blockships off Sword Beach to form a Mulberry harbour. On 8 June 1944, she arrived at Portland to begin the daily escort of the EPL 2 series of tank landing ship convoys between the United Kingdom and the invasion beaches. Released from operations related to the invasion in July 1944, Versatile returned to convoy defence and patrol duties, conducting them in the English Channel and Southwestern Approaches until the surrender of Germany in early May 1945. Decommissioning and disposal Versatile was decommissioned soon after Germanys surrender, no longer being carried on the Royal Navys active list by July 1945. By 1947 she was on the disposal list, and she was sold on 7 May 1947 for scrapping by M. Brechin at Granton, Scotland. She arrived at the shipbreakers yard on 10 September 1948.Colledge, J.J., Ships of the Royal Navy: The Complete Record of Fighting Ships of the Royal Navy From the Fifteenth Century to the Present Day, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1987, , p. 366.

An actor hired to portray the legendary terrorist the Mandarin, he first appeared in the 2013 film Iron Man 3. General response to the character was mixed, with many comic fans criticizing the character and how his reveal affected the film's Mandarin portrayal, while others defended the twist by noting its social commentary and how it avoided the supposedly racist caricature of the comics' Mandarin. Kingsley reprised the role in All Hail the King, a 2014 Marvel One-Shots short film also set in the MCU.  Marvel Cinematic Universe   Iron Man 3  Slattery is a washed-up, drug-addicted actor hired by Aldrich Killian and the think tank Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM) to portray the Mandarin, a persona influenced by many modern terrorists and named after a supposed legendary Chinese title. Slattery stars in propaganda videos that are broadcast to the world as a cover for AIM's explosive Extremis experiments. Slattery lives oblivious to the true meaning of his actions, surrounded by wealth and drugs provided by AIM, until he is discovered by Tony Stark. Slattery is arrested following Stark's defeat of Killian, but was pleased by the publicity he received as he was arrested.  All Hail the King  In Seagate Prison, Slattery lives luxuriously, with his own personal \\"butler\\" and adoring fans among the other inmates, until he is broken out by Jackson Norriss, a Ten Rings terrorist posing as a documentary filmmaker, who explains that the real Mandarin is angered with Slattery's use of the title, and wishes to take it back.  Concept and creation  While writing the screenplay for Iron Man 3, Shane Black and Drew Pearce wanted to thematically reflect \\"the idea for Tony [Stark] of false faces and the idea of the dual personality of Tony as an out superhero who is basically using his self-definition through the false face of Iron Man.\\" Pearce pitched, \\"what if the Mandarin is an actor?\\" to Black, and the character was developed from there. Ben Kingsley entered negotiations for the role in April 2012, and had joined the cast of Iron Man 3 by September, when he stated, \\"Quite soon I'll be with everybody and we'll be discussing the look and the feel and the direction of the character. It's very early days yet, but I'm so thrilled to be on board.\\" The idea for a Marvel One-Shot centered on Slattery was conceived on the Iron Man 3 set by Pearce and producer Stephen Broussard. Marvel Studios and consultant Joss Whedon were positive about the short, reliant on Kingsley's involvement. In October 2013, Kingsley said he was working on a secret project with Marvel involving \\"many members of the crew that were involved in Iron Man 3.\\" This was later revealed to be the short, written and directed by Pearce. Though some of the dialogue is written in response to critics of Iron Man 3s Mandarin portrayal, the story was written simply as an extension of the Ten Rings and Mandarin storyline featured throughout the Iron Man films. Pearce wrote the short to be ambiguous enough that the storyline could be further explored in future films or television series.  Characterization  For his performance as Slattery as the Mandarin, Kingsley \\"wanted a voice that would disconcert a Western audience. I wanted a voice that would sound far more homegrown and familiar‚Äîa familiarity like a teacher's voice or a preacher's voice. The rhythms and tones of an earnest, almost benign, teacher‚Äîtrying to educate people for their own good.\\" Black explained that part of altering the character from the comics was to avoid the Fu Manchu stereotype, and instead say that he \\"draws a cloak around him of Chinese symbols and dragons because it represents his obsessions with Sun Tzu in various ancient arts of warfare that he studied.\\" The videos where the Mandarin gives historical background to the \\"attacks\\" show how he was created by \\"a think tank of people trying to create a modern terrorist\\", and so \\"represents every terrorist in a way,\\" from South American insurgency tactics to the videos of Osama bin Laden. Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now was also an influence for the Mandarin.  Reception  The reveal of Trevor Slattery in Iron Man 3, after only his terrorist Mandarin persona had been marketed, was met with mixed responses, as many fans of the comics opposed the changes made to the original character. Matt Singer of Business Insider defended the twist, saying, \\"They are not upset with the movie because it's bad‚Äîthat would be a legitimate complaint‚Äîthey're upset because it's good, but not in the same way that the original comic books were good.\\" Singer felt that the film \\"rather brilliantly evades that minefield [of the comics' racist caricature] by using it as the fuel for satire; revealing the Kingsley Mandarin's mish-mosh of Orientalist imagery as a construction designed to play into ignorant people's fears. Black suggests we should be far more worried about the well-dressed, amoral CEO than the vaguely defined \\"Other\\" of so many bad pieces of pop culture....Part of what I liked about Iron Man 3 was the fact that it did something different. Where some readers saw a slap in the face, I saw a refreshing change.\\" Devin Faraci at Birth.Movies.Death. found the character more \\"satisfying\\" than a more faithful version of the character could have been, stating, \\"the reveal of the truth behind The Mandarin would be worthless if it was handled poorly. Thankfully Black has cast Sir Ben Kingsley in the role, and he demolishes the part. As The Mandarin he's a heart of darkness, a stylized amalgamation of four decades' worth of demagogues and terrorists. As Trevor Slattery ... he's a comic dream, a dissolute mess into which Kingsley just hilariously collapses. It's a brilliant performance\\". Joey Esposito, writing for IGN, was \\"totally shocked\\" by the fan backlash to the character, feeling that the update was an improvement by avoiding \\"the traditional portrayal of the character[, that] being the perpetuation of a stereotype that has no place in modern society.\\" Esposito thought that even the film's initial depiction of the Mandarin was \\"ridiculous and silly\\", and that the Slattery reveal \\"redeemed\\" that part of the film for him. In response to the fan controversy, Pearce said, \\"I'm unbelievably proud of what we did, and also the fact that we actually snuck a surprise into a big summer movie, which is, on a logistical level alone, really hard to do, now. I was surprised at the small but vocal group's venom about [the character change], but...I could see how that surprise might be a bit of a shock. And I'm sorry that it pissed people off, but I'm also like, it's kind of our job to push the boundaries and surprise and hopefully delight.\\" Black, also responding to the controversy, said, \\"What was of use about the Mandarin's portrayal in this movie, to me, is that it offers up a way that you can sort of show how people are complicit in being frightened ... hopefully, by the end you're like, 'Yeah, we were really frightened of the Mandarin, but in the end he really wasn't that bad after all.' In fact, the whole thing was just a product of this anonymous, behind-the-scenes guy\\" rather than the \\"available and obvious target\\", \\"a message that's more interesting for the modern world\\". Reviewing All Hail the King, Cliff Wheatley, also at IGN, described the short as \\"a return to the loveable personality of the hapless Trevor ... that should satisfy both lovers and haters\\" of the character. He added that \\"Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans.\\" Faraci felt that the character \\"was used the perfect amount in Iron Man Three, and giving him more screen time here, in a side project, feels the right way to return to him. Kingsley is having a blast, delivering plenty of wonderful jokes and sinking right into the clueless, egocentric character who represents all of our worst stereotypes of actors.\\" See also *Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe  References   External links  * Trevor Slattery on IMDb Category:Fictional actors Category:Fictional drug addicts Category:Film characters introduced in 2013 Category:Fictional English people Category:Fictional impostors Category:Iron Man characters Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe original characters Category:Superhero film characters ","title":"Trevor Slattery"},{"id":"39372787","text":"S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine deaminase (, MTA deaminase, 5-methylthioadenosine deaminase) is an enzyme with systematic name S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine amidohydrolase.

Paul's early research explored the relationship between the Dead Sea Scrolls and Karaite Judaism. In 2011 Paul was made an Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government, in recognition of his contribution to French culture. Life Early life Paul was born in 1933 on a tiny farm in the Pyrenees, one of four children. At the age of 11, through a government scholarship, he enrolled in the College of Notre-Dame de Comminges, in Montr√©jeau. His father, Thomas Paul, died shortly after this. As a young man of 18, Paul entered the seminary in Toulouse to become a Catholic priest, where he began the study of Hebrew, which he has said determined his future. He then fulfilled his military duty for the next three years, serving in Algeria and Morocco. Returning to France and his studies, Paul enrolled at University Seminary of Pope Pius XI in Toulouse, where he earned a licentiate in theology. He then went to Paris, where he joined the Society of Saint- Sulpice, dedicated to the training of the Catholic clergy, and continued his studies. He has since left both the priesthood and the Society and married Isabelle Le Corre. Academic career In Paris, Paul came to know the biblical scholar, Jean Carmignac, who introduced him to Karaite Judaism, which developed in the 9th century. It became the topic of his doctoral thesis. During this time, he furthered his knowledge of Aramaic and learned Syriac and Coptic, earning a diploma in Semitic languages. He was given the job of editing the article Karaites in the supplement to the Dictionnaire de la Bible published in 1962. In October 1963 Paul moved to Rome, where he began studies at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. During this time, he was able to observe firsthand the proceedings of the Second Vatican Council. He returned to Paris after two years and submitted his first thesis on the origins of Karaism in May 1966. This resulted in the publication of his first book, in 1968, L‚Äô√©vangile de l‚Äôenfance selon Saint Matthieu (The Infancy Narrative in the Gospel of St. Matthew). During this time he was the professor of exegesis at the Regional Seminary of the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es. Paul's research on the origins of Karaism were published in 1969, the same year in which he began to teach at the Institut Catholique de Paris. In September of that year, he gave an address at the Congress of the French Catholic Association for Biblical Studies held at Chantilly, Oise, where Paul Ricoeur and Roland Barthes acted as responders. In 1970, he was appointed as the editor of the influential journal, Recherches de science religieuse, succeeding the noted Jesuit scholar and cardinal, Jean Dani√©lou. Paul began to explore the significance of Structuralism for his work. He was greatly by two books: The Archaeology of Knowledge by Michel Foucault and The Logic of Life: A History of Heredity by Fran√ßois Jacob. Working with this new perspective, he went on to earn the degree of Doctor of Arts in 1974. That same year, he was the Literary Director for √âditions Descl√©e, a noted Catholic publishing firm. At the same time, he released his work L‚Äôimpertinence biblique (The Impertinence of the Bible). This book so disturbed the French Catholic hierarchy that he was forced to leave the Institut Catholique in 1977. In collaboration with the French historian, Charles Pietri, Paul launched his monumental History of Christianity in 1981. The process took 20 years to complete, and produced 14 volumes. The work has since been translated into German and Italian. Meanwhile, together with Bernard Sesbo√º√©, he launched a 4-volume History of Dogmas in 1989. In 2004 Paul was entrusted with the direction of a new series of books on Qumran called La Biblioth√®que de Qumr√¢n, published by √âditions du Cerf, which was to be written by a team of young scholars in the field. The first book in the series was published in 2008. In turn, this sparked a successful exhibit on the Dead Sea scrolls held at the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris in the spring of 2010.

A number of journal, book publications, book chapters, and presentations at professional meetings in each area have ensued. Based on the pioneering empirical effectiveness research on brief closed groups in the 1970s, he developed a vertically-integrated group leader training program. The model program was instituted at the University of Hawaii (1972) and subsequently at Santa Clara University (1982), where it continues.[4] The training involves separate classes in group theory and practice, membership in a training group, advanced class in group leadership, co-leadership of a training group with an experienced professional and finally senior leadership after licensure. Shapiro‚Äôs signature work was a two decade study of the male experience of fatherhood. These interview and clinically-informed studies ranged from expectant fathering (When She‚Äôs Pregnant: The Essential Guide for Expectant Fathers, When Men are Pregnant: Needs and Concerns of Expectant Fathers, Becoming a Father) to lifelong fatherhood and father-child interactions (The Measure if a Man: Becoming the Father You Wish Your Father Had Been). Most importantly, the work underscores the psychological influence of a man‚Äôs relationship with his own father (or significant male figures) to the manner in which he subsequently approaches his children. His fatherhood work was part of a renewed interest in men and fatherhood that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. Until this time, during most of the twentieth century, parenting and research was almost exclusively focused on motherhood. Publications Shapiro has authored, edited, and contributed to over twenty books, many of which have been published in numerous languages. His book publications include: *Pragmatic Existential Counseling and Psychotherapy: Intimacy, Intuition and the Search for Meaning\\" (2016, Sage).Pragmatic Existential Counseling and Psychotherapy: Intimacy, Intuition and the Search for Meaning.

It is recognized as a collection of usually low quality films with low budgets. Although the films had sexual tones and used double entendre, they were not particularly explicit. The genre is possibly based on the Italian erotic comedies. The popular term for it came from the film Las ficheras, produced and released in 1975, which described the experiences of many women who entertained men at nightclubs. The settings and plots of these films tended to be simple. Though they enjoyed box-office success and were popular, they are now generally regarded as poor examples of Mexican cinema ; moreover, they frequently received classification as being unsuitable for minors. Some of the films of this Mexican genre included El rey de las ficheras, La pulquer√≠a, Mu√±ecas de medianoche, Bellas de noche, and Entre ficheras anda el diablo. The best-known Mexican and international actors and actresses who were known to have participated in ficheras films were: * Sasha Montenegro * Ang√©lica Cha√≠n * Andr√©s Garc√≠a * Mauricio Garc√©s * Lina Santos * Lyn May * Marcia Bell * Carmen Salinas * Alfonso Zayas * Jorge Rivero * Alberto Rojas \\"El caballo\\" * Rafael Incl√°n * Roberto Iba√±ez * Leopoldo Garc√≠a Pel√°ez Ben√≠tez \\"Polo Polo\\" * Antonio Raxel * Ra√∫l Padilla \\"El Choforo\\" * Miguel M.

History The idea for the Tiumpan Head Lighthouse in the village of Portvoller in Point, Isle of Lewis was long promoted, but refused for many years by the Board of Trade. After a recommendation by the Western Highlands and Islands Commission to additionally keep a watch on illegal trawlers, it was approved in May 1879. The lighthouse and building were designed by David and Charles Stevenson and built by John Aitken, at an estimated cost of ¬£9000. William Frew was appointed as inspector of works. Chance Brothers made the optics and Dove and Co. the revolving machine. The light was first exhibited on 1 December 1900. Six lightkeepers were attached to the station, three lightkeepers and their families at the station, with a local assistant and two occasional lightkeepers coming in from Portnaguran village nearby. Elizabeth II visited the lighthouse in 1956, with the young Duke of Cornwall and the Princess Anne. The seven-year-old heir to the throne sounded the first blast on a new fog siren. The fog signal was operated by compressed air supplied from a compressor, driven by a Kelvin Diesel engine. There were three Kelvin engines and compressors, and when the fog signal was in operation, two of them were in service to maintain the required air pressure with one standby, in rotation. In 1984, the fog signal was discontinued and the fog horn building was demolished. The lighthouse was automated in 1985 and is monitored from Edinburgh. The former keepers' accommodation is no longer needed and is now home to kennels and a cattery.

It is found in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. In its specific name Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg honoured his late partner the Prussian naturalist Wilhelm Hemprich; they were among the first to study the marine life of the Red Sea. Description Lobophyllia hemprichii is a colonial species of coral that may form hemispherical or flattened mounds up to in diameter. Several adjacent colonies, sometimes of different colours, may grow together to form a composite colony. The corralites (skeletal cups) may be phaceloid (having a tubular form and growing from a common base) or flabello- meandroid (arranged in valleys with the neighbouring valleys each having a ridge, with the valleys dividing irregularly). Each corallite has a number of septa (vertical blades inside the corallite cup) which taper in thickness and have tall sharp teeth. This coral is some shade of grey, pink, violet or yellowish-brown, sometimes a uniform colour or sometimes with contrasting regions. L. hemprichii is a zooxanthellate coral, having single-celled photosynthesizing organisms known as dinoflagellates living within the tissues. Photosynthesis of these protists provides the coral with nutrients. The thick, fleshy polyps can retract back into the corallite cups in which they sit or extend their tentacles to feed. Distribution Lobophyllia hemprichii is native to the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific. Its range extends from the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the east coast of Africa through the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal to Japan, Indonesia, New Guinea and Australia. It is most common at depths between but can occur down to about . It is found on upper reef slopes, where it is often the dominant species of coral and sometimes the only species. Status The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists this species as being of \\"least concern\\", on the basis that it has a wide range and is common in most of that range. Although susceptible to bleaching and to other damage caused to corals by a rise in sea temperature and ocean acidification, it is thought to be more resilient than many other species because of its large population size and wide genetic variability. It is collected for the aquarium trade, Indonesia being the main exporter. It is included in CITES Appendix II as are all stony corals.

Other common names include mahaze, Japanese river goby, Oriental goby, and spotted goby. It is native to Asia, where its range includes China, Japan, Korea, parts of Russia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It has spread beyond its native range to become an introduced, and often invasive, species. It has been recorded in Australia, Mexico, and Florida and California in the United States.CABI, 2013. Acanthogobius flavimanus. In: Invasive Species Compendium. Wallingford, UK: CAB International. Description This fish reaches 25 to 30 centimeters in length. It is light brown with darker saddle-marks and spots. The ventral fins are yellow. These fins are fused to form a cup. There are two dorsal fins. The species can be identified by the arrangement of pores on its head, the spines and rays in the dorsal fins, and the scales and papillae on the head and face. The yellow ventral fins also distinguish it from other gobies. The lifespan is generally up to 3 years, but some individuals may get older.Acanthogobius flavimanus. California Fish Website. University of California. Biology This fish spends most of the year in rivers and streams. During the winter it descends to more saline environments, such as bays and estuaries, where it breeds. There it is a bottom-dweller, living on the muddy or sandy beds. Spawning only occurs when the temperature is between about 7¬∞ and 13 ¬∞C. One fish may produce up to 37,000 eggs. Each egg is about 5.5 millimeters long. The eggs are deposited in a nest, which is a burrow up to 35 centimeters deep, constructed by the male. The nest may be guarded by both male and female. In optimal conditions the eggs hatch in about 28 days. The fish tolerates fresh and saline waters, and rapid movements between them. It can live in a wide variety of water habitat types. The adult can spend its whole life in freshwater, but the larvae generally develop in saltwater. The diet of the goby includes many kinds of small organisms, such as copepods, amphipods, mantis shrimp, mysids, small fish, and polychaetes. It has also been known to consume fly larvae, bivalves such as the Asian clam, ostracods, and various detritus.Workman, M. L. and J. E. Merz. (2007). Introduced yellowfin goby, Acanthogobius flavimanus: Diet and habitat use in the Lower Mokelumne River, California. San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science 5(1). Natural predators of the goby include yellow goosefish (Lophius litulon), ocellate spot skate (Okamejei kenojei), Japanese whiting (Sillago japonica), leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata), ashishirohaze (Acanthogobius lactipes), and suzuki (Lateolabrax japonicus). Fish of this species are often found to carry heavy parasite loads. They play host to the metacercariae of flukes, including Echinostoma hortense, Heterophyes nocens, Heterophyopsis continua, Pygidiopsis summa, Strictodora fuscata, S. lari, and Acanthotrema felis. These, particularly E. hortense, pose a risk to humans. People in Korea catch and eat the yellowfin goby raw, and often become infected with flukes.Sohn, W., et al. (2009).

As an introduced species A. flavimanus, the largest species of goby found in estuaries of California, was first discovered in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system of California in 1963. It had probably been introduced a few years earlier, around the same time as the chameleon goby (Tridentiger trigonocephalus). It may have arrived in ballast water or as eggs on biofouling animals such as oysters on ship hulls. Anglers using the goby as bait in the local river system may have aided its dispersal.Nico, L., et al. 2013. Acanthogobius flavimanus. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, FL. Now it is one of the most common bottom-dwelling fish in the rivers and the Delta, as well as San Francisco Bay. There it has become an important prey item for the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). On the other hand, it has negative effects on the local ecosystem. It may compete with native fish such as the tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi). The fish was first encountered in Southern California in 1977, when it was found in Los Angeles Harbor; it was found in San Diego a few years later. This fish is thought to have been introduced to Australia in ballast or on imported oysters.Acanthogobius flavimanus. Global Invasive Species Database. 2013.

Although procreation continues to be the primary explanation for sexual behavior in animals, recent observations on animal behavior have given alternative reasons for the engagement in sexual activities by animals. Animals have been observed to engage in sex for social interaction, demonstration of dominance, aggression relief, exchange for significant materials, and sexual stimulation. Observed non-procreative sexual activities include non-copulatory mounting (without penetration, or by the female), oral sex, genital stimulation, anal stimulation, interspecies mating, and acts of affection. There have also been observations of animals engaging in homosexual behaviors, as well as sex with dead animals and sex involving juveniles.  Social interaction and bonding  Lions are known to engage in sex to create bonds and interact with each other. Lions live in a social group known as a pride that consists of 2‚Äì18 females and 1‚Äì7 males. The females found in these prides were born into the pride. The males enter the pride from other prides. The success of reproduction for each individual lion is dependent on the number of male lions found in their social group. Male lions create coalitions and search for prides to take over. Successful coalitions have usually created a strong bond with each other and will take over prides. Once winning in a competition, all current males in the pride will be kicked out and left to find another pride. While in search for another pride these males will often engage in sexual behavior with each other; creating a strong bond in this new coalition created. Sex is a basic form of communication in bonobos‚Äô life. It seems to infuse everything from simple expressions of affection to the establishment of dominance. Female bonobos have been observed to engage in sexual activities to create bonds with dominant bonobos. Having created this bond with the male, they will share food with each other and not compete with each other. All members of the group are potential sex partners, males participate in sexual activity with other males, as do females with other females. These bonds made between females are for protection against male bonobos. If a male bonobo attempts to harass a female bonobo, the other females will help the female defend herself because of the strong bonds they have with each other.  Aggression  Several species in the animal kingdom turn to sexual activity as a way to solve a disagreement. Bonobos are one species notoriously known for using sexual behavior to relieve their aggression with each other. Sex is part of bonobo's daily routine and social life. Unlike other primates aggression is substituted with sex. Sexual activity in bonobos is very high, yet the rate of reproduction is the same as a chimpanzee. In a study concentrated on primate aggression, researchers wanted to observe primates in conflict. How primates coped and resolved conflicts was a main concern in this study. Researchers stated that after primates participated in a heated, physical fight; both primates involved in the fight would hug and have a mouth-to-mouth kiss. This action was considered as a demonstration of affection and reconciliation. Sexual interaction has also been witnessed in female bonobos to avoid aggression. When hungry, the female bonobo will approach a male bonobo and engage in sexual activity to avoid aggression. After their quick sexual activity, the female will take a portion of the male's food. The male will not demonstrate any form of aggression towards the female.  Proximate causes  Awareness in species is difficult to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have instinct and a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell it if it carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will fall out of the hole in the wall. It does not need awareness, but it does seem to work on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed. Studies of the brain have proven that pleasure and displeasure are an important component in the lives of animals. It has been established that the limbic neural mechanism that generates reactions are very similar across all mammals. Many studies have concentrated on the brain reward system and how similar it is across mammals. Through extensive research, scientists have been able to conclude that the brain reward system in animals is extremely similar to that of humans. The mechanism of core pleasure reaction is significantly important for animals and humans.  Case study  In a case study, female Japanese macaques were studied to find evidence of possible female copulatory orgasms. Through the study the frequency of orgasms did not correlate with the age of the Japanese macaques or the rank. Researchers observed that the longer and higher number of pelvic thrusts, the longer copulation lasted. There was an orgasmic response in 80 of the 240 Japanese macaques studied.  Reward system  Evolutionary principles have predicted that the reward system is part of the proximate mechanism underlying the behavior. Because animals possess a brain reward system they are motivated to perform in different ways by desire and reinforced by pleasure. Animals establish security of food, shelter, social contact, and mating because proximate mechanism, if they do not seek these necessities they will not survive. All vertebrates share similarities in body structure; they all have a skeleton, a nervous system, a circulatory system, a digestive system and excretory system. Similar to humans, non-human animals also have a sensory system. The sensory system is responsible for the basic five senses from touch to tasting. Most of the physiological and biochemical responses found in animals are found in humans. Neurophysiologists have not found any fundamental difference between the structure and function of neurons and synapse between humans and other animals. = Case study = Recent studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has provided evidence proving that chemical changes that occur with emotions are similar between humans and non-human animals. In a study comparing guinea pigs and humans, it was determined that the distress experienced by offspring separation in a guinea pig and a human going through depression activates the same region of the brain. The opiate receptor was also examined, allowing observation of the pleasure stimuli. In the procedure both a human and a rat had their receptors blocked with a certain drug. Once receptors were blocked, both the rat and the human were exposed to pleasurable food, but both were disinclined to eat the food.  Types of behavior  Engagements of sexual activities during non-breeding seasons have been observed in the animal kingdom. Dolphins and Japanese macaques are two of the many species that engage in sexual activities that do not lead to fertilization. Great varieties of non-copulatory mounting are expressed in several species. Male lions engage in mounting with other male lions, especially when in search for another pride. The varieties of mounting include mounting without erections, mounting with erection but no penetration, and mounting from the side. Expressions of affection are displayed in the animal kingdom as well. Affectionate behaviors do not include penetration or genital rubbing, but are still seen as a manner of sexual behavior. An affectionate activity can be as simple as licking. Male lions are known for head rubbing, bats engage in licking, and mountain sheep rub horns and faces with each other. Animals have also engaged in kissing, touching of noses, mouths and muzzles have been witnessed in African elephants, walruses, and mountain zebras. Primates also engage in kissing that is incredibly similar to human display of kissing. Chimpanzees have full mouth-to-mouth contact, and bonobos kiss with their mouth open and mutual tongue stimulation. There are a variety of acts to show affection such as African elephants intertwining their trunks, giraffes engaging in ‚Äúnecking‚Äù, and Hanuman langurs cuddling with each other in a front to back sitting position. Non-penetrative genital stimulation is very common throughout the animal kingdom. Different forms of self and partner genital stimulation have been observed in the animal kingdom. Oral sex has been observed throughout the animal kingdom, from dolphins to primates. Bonobos have been observed to transition from a simple demonstration of affection to non-penetrative genital stimulation. Animals perform oral sex by licking, sucking or nuzzling the genitals of their partner. Another form of genital stimulation is masturbation. Masturbation is widespread throughout mammals for both males and females. It is less common in birds. There are several techniques, in which animals engage in masturbation from using paws, feet, flippers, tails, and sometimes using objects like sticks, pebbles, and leaves. Masturbation occurs more often in primate species with large testes relative to their body size.  Anal penetration  Anal penetration with the penis (both in heterosexual and male homosexual dyads) has been observed among some primate species. Male homosexual anal penetration has been recorded in Old World primate species, including gorillas, orangutans, and some members of the Macaca genus (namely, stumptail, rhesus, and Japanese macaques). It has also been recorded in at least two New World primate species, the squirrel monkey and the spider monkey. Morris (1970) also described one heterosexual orangutan dyad where all penetration was anal. However, the practice might have been a consequence of homosexual rearing, as the male orangutan in this dyad had had extensive same‚Äìsex experience. A case of male homosexual anal penetration with the finger has also reported among orangutans, and Bruce Bagemihl mentions it as one of the homosexual practices recorded at least once among male chimpanzees.  Autoeroticism or masturbation  Vervet monkey It appears that many animals, both male and female, masturbate, both when partners are available and otherwise. For example, it has been observed in cats, dogs, male deer, rhinoceroses, boars, and male monkeys. A review from the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine says: > [The] behavior known within the horse breeding industry as masturbation ... > involves normal periodic erections and penile movements. This behavior, both > from the descriptive field studies cited above and in extensive study of > domestic horses, is now understood as normal, frequent behavior of male > equids. Attempting to inhibit or punish masturbation, for example by tying a > brush to the area of the flank underside where the penis rubs into contact > with the underside, which is still a common practice of horse managers > regionally around the world, often leads to increased masturbation and > disturbances of normal breeding behaviour. Castration does not prevent masturbation, as it is observed in geldings. Masturbation is common in both mares and stallions, before and after puberty. Sexologist Havelock Ellis in his 1927 Studies in the Psychology of Sex identified bulls, goats, sheep, camels and elephants as species known to practice autoeroticism, adding of some other species: > I am informed by a gentleman who is a recognized authority on goats, that > they sometimes take the penis into the mouth and produce actual orgasm, thus > practicing auto-fellatio. As regards ferrets ... \\"if the bitch, when in > heat, cannot obtain a dog [ie, male ferret] she pines and becomes ill. If a > smooth pebble is introduced into the hutch, she will masturbate upon it, > thus preserving her normal health for one season.

Blumenbach observed a bear act somewhat similarly on > seeing other bears coupling, and hyenas, according to Ploss and Bartels, > have been seen practicing mutual masturbation by licking each other's > genitals. In his 1999 book, Biological exuberance, Bruce Bagemihl documents that: and that: > Apes and Monkeys use a variety of objects to masturbate with and even > deliberately create implements for sexual stimulation ... often in highly > creative ways. David Linden, professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University, remarks that: > ... perhaps the most creative form of animal masturbation is that of the > male bottlenose dolphin, which has been observed to wrap a live, wriggling > eel around its penis. Among elephants, female same-sex behaviours have been documented only in captivity where they are known to masturbate one another with their trunks.  Oral sex  Animals of several species are documented as engaging in both autofellatio and oral sex. Although easily confused by laypeople, autofellatio and oral sex are separate, sexually oriented behaviors, distinct from non- sexual grooming or the investigation of scents. Auto-fellatio or oral sex in animals is documented in fruit flies, spiders (Darwin's bark and widow), brown bears,These Bears Are Having Lots Of Oral Sex, And Scientists Think They Know Why (The Huffington Post) By: Grenoble, Ryan. stump-tailed macaques, Tibetan macaques, wolves, goats, primates, hyenas, bats, cape ground squirrels and sheep (see section Masturbation for details). In the greater short-nosed fruit bat, copulation by males is dorsoventral and the females lick the shaft or the base of the male's penis, but not the glans, which has already penetrated the vagina. While the females do this, the penis is not withdrawn and research has shown a positive relationship between length of the time that the penis is licked and the duration of copulation. Post copulation genital grooming has also been observed.  Homosexual behaviour  Two male mallards, Anas platyrhynchos. Mallards have rates of male-male sexual activity that are unusually high for birds, in some cases, as high as 19% of all pairs in a population.Bagemihl The presence of same-sex sexual behaviour was not scientifically reported on a large scale until recent times. Homosexual behaviour does occur in the animal kingdom outside humans, especially in social species, particularly in marine birds and mammals, monkeys, and the great apes. As of 1999, the scientific literature contained reports of homosexual behavior in at least 471 wild species. Organisers of the Against Nature? exhibit stated that \\"homosexuality has been observed among 1,500 species, and that in 500 of those it is well documented.\\" > To turn the approach on its head: No species has been found in which > homosexual behaviour has not been shown to exist, with the exception of > species that never have sex at all, such as sea urchins and aphis. Moreover, > a part of the animal kingdom is hermaphroditic, truly bisexual. For them, > homosexuality is not an issue. Homosexual behavior exists on a spectrum, and may or may not involve penetration. Apart from sexual activity, it can refer to homosexual pair- bonding, homosexual parenting and homosexual acts of affection. Engaging in homosexual behavior may allow species to obtain benefits such as gaining practice, relieving tension, and experiencing pleasure. Georgetown University professor Janet Mann has specifically theorised that homosexual behaviour, at least in dolphins, is an evolutionary advantage that minimizes intraspecies aggression, especially among males. \\"Humans have created the myth that sexuality can be justified only by reproduction, which by definition limits it to hetero sex,\\" says Michael Bronski, author of The Pleasure Principle: Culture, Backlash, and the Struggle for Gay Freedom. \\"But here is an animal society that uses homosexuality to improve its social life.\\" After studying bonobos for his book Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape, primatologist Frans de Waal, a professor of psychology at Emory University in Atlanta, says that such expressions of intimacy are consistent with the homosexual behaviour of what he terms \\"the erotic champions of the world\\". \\"Same-sex, opposite-sex ‚Äî bonobos just love sex play,\\" de Waal said in an interview. \\"They have so much sex, it gets boring.\\" Homosexual behaviour is found in 6‚Äì10% of rams (sheep) and associated with variations in cerebral mass distribution and chemical activity. > Approximately eight percent of [male] rams exhibit sexual preferences [that > is, even when given a choice] for male partners (male-oriented rams) in > contrast to most rams, which prefer female partners (female-oriented rams). > We identified a cell group within the medial preoptic area/anterior > hypothalamus of age-matched adult sheep that was significantly larger in > adult rams than in ewes ... Male bighorn sheep are divisible into two kinds: the typical males among whom homosexual behaviour, including intercourse, is common and \\"effeminate sheep\\", or \\"behavioural transvestites\\", which are not known to engage in homosexual behaviour.In Brief: Rams Will Be Rams. washingtonpost.com (4 July 2004).

Male-male copulation has been observed in captive penguins\\"Central Park Zoo's gay penguins ignite debate\\" by Dinitia Smith, San Francisco Chronicle, 7 February 2004 and homosexual behaviour has been observed among bats, in particular, the fruit bat. = Pair-bonding in homosexuality = Homosexual pair-bonding can be established several ways; two of the main ways are pair bonding as partners or as companions. As partners, both animals will engage in sexual activities with each other. In companions bonding, sexual engagement is not necessary in the relationship. This form of homosexuality is more of a partnership and friendship; they spend all their time together. More than 70 species of birds engage in one of these two bonding. = Homosexual parenting = Homosexual parenting is very common, especially in birds. Homosexual pairs have better skills and larger nests than heterosexual pairs. Homosexual pairing can occur different ways, one example would be two female animals with offspring coming together and helping each other raise their offspring. = Genital-genital rubbing = Genital-genital rubbing, or GG rubbing, among non-human animals is sexual activity in which one animal rubs his or her genitals against the genitals of another animal. The term GG rubbing is frequently used by primatologists to describe this type of sexual intimacy among female bonobos, and is stated to be the \\"bonobo's most typical sexual pattern, undocumented in any other primate\\". The term is sometimes used in reference to GG rubbing among male bonobos, under the term \\"penis fencing\\", which is the non-human form of frot that human males engage in. Such rubbing between males is thought, according to varying evolutionary theorists, to have existed before the development of hominids into humans and bonobos, and may or may not have occurred in the homosexual activity of both of these genetically related species. Genital rubbing has been observed once among male orangutans and several times in a small group of lar gibbons, where two males thrust their genitals together, sometimes resulting in ejaculation in one of the partners. It has been observed among bull manatees, in conjunction with \\"kissing\\",Bagemihl and is also common among homosexually active mammals.  Inter-species sex  A dog mates with a coyote to produce a dog-coyote hybrid. Some animals opportunistically mate with individuals of another species. This is more commonly observed in domesticated species and animals in captivity, possibly because captivity is associated with a decrease in aggression and an increase in sexual receptivity. Nevertheless, animals in the wild have been observed to attempt sexual activity with other species. It is mostly documented among species that belong to the same genus, but sometimes occurs between species of distant taxa. Alfred Kinsey cites reports of sexual activity involving a female eland with an ostrich, a male dog with a chicken, a male monkey with a snake, and a female chimpanzee with a cat. A 2008 review of the literature found 44 species pairs that had been observed attempting interspecies mating, and 46 species pairs that had completed interspecies matings, not counting cases that had resulted in hybridization. Most were known from laboratory experiments, but field observations had also been made. It may result in fitness loss because of the waste of time, energy, and nutrients. Male sea otters have been observed forcibly copulating with seals, and male seals have been observed forcibly copulating with penguins. Inter-species sexual behavior has also been observed in sea lions.Miller, Edward H., Alberto Ponce de Le√≥n, and Robert L. Delong. \\"Violent interspecific sexual behavior by male sea lions (Otariidae): evolutionary and phylogenetic implications.\\" Marine mammal science 12.3 (1996): 468-476. Male grasshoppers of the species Tetrix ceperoi often mount other species of either sex and even flies, but are normally repelled by the larger females. Males of the spider mite species Panonychus citri copulate with female Panonychus mori mites almost as often as with their own species, even though it does not result in reproduction. The Japanese macaque has been observed attempting to mate with the sika deer.  Sex involving juveniles  Male stoats (Mustela erminea) will sometimes mate with infant females of their species. This is a natural part of their reproductive biology ‚Äì they have a delayed gestation period, so these females give birth the following year when they are fully grown. In one reported observation, a male spotted hyena attempted to mate with a female hyena, but she succeeded in driving him off. He eventually turned to her ten-month-old cub, repeatedly mounting and ejaculating on it. The cub sometimes ignored this and sometimes struggled \\"slightly as if in play\\". The mother did not intervene.Kruuk, H. (1972) The Spotted Hyena, University of Chicago Press, , p. 232 It appears to be common in the Ad√©lie penguin.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/09/sex-depravity-penguins- scott-antarctic Among insects, there have been reports of immature females being forcibly copulated with. Juvenile male chimpanzees have been recorded mounting and copulating with immature chimps. Infants in bonobo societies are often involved in sexual behaviour. Immature male bonobos have been recorded initiating genital play with both adolescent and mature female bonobos. Copulation-like contact between immature bonobo males and mature female bonobos increases with age and continues until the male bonobo has reached juvenile age. In contrast, adult gorillas do not show any sexual interest in juvenile or infant members of their species. Primates regularly have sex in full view of infants, juveniles and younger members of their species.  Necrophilia  black and white tegu mounts a female that has been dead for two days and attempts to mate. Photo by Ivan Sazima. Necrophilia describes when an animal engages in a sexual act with a dead animal. It has been observed in mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs. It sometimes occurs in the Ad√©lie penguin. Homosexual necrophilia has been reported between two male mallard ducks. One duck was believed to be pursuing another duck with the goal of rape (a common aspect of duck sexual behaviour) when the second duck collided with a window and died immediately. The observer, Kees Moeliker, suggested that \\"when one died the other one just went for it and didn't get any negative feedback‚Äîwell, didn't get any feedback.\\" The case study earned Moeliker an Ig Nobel Prize in biology, awarded for research that cannot or should not be reproduced.

Life He was the son of Henry Newcome LL.D. of Hackney (died 1756) and Lydia Morland. His father established Newcome's School there, a noted private academy. Richard Newcome was his uncle. His paternal grandfather was Peter Newcome, son of Henry Newcome the nonconformist minister, and his maternal grandfather was Benjamin Morland; the school was previously run by Morland. Peter Newcome the son matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge in 1732, graduating B.A. in 1735 and M.A. in 1738. He was then a fellow of the college from 1740 to 1742. The Newcome family had a social connection to the family of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, who died in 1740. Lord Charles Cavendish married the Duke's daughter Anne Grey, and Henry Cavendish the natural philosopher was their son, and a pupil at Newcome's School from 1742. His father recommended Peter Newcome for the Royal Society in the same year. The other sponsors were Philip Yorke who was an alumnus of Newcome's School, Thomas Birch and Daniel Wray. Through this connection to the Cavendish circle, Newcome participated in scientific life in London. He joined the informal Royal Society dining club in 1744.Archibald Geikie, Annals of the Royal Society Club; the record of a London dining-club in the eighteenth & nineteenth centuries, (1917), p. 11; archive.org. He attended Sir William Watson's 1747 experiments in the conduction of electricity across the River Thames. Later, in the 1760s, Newcome was on the Royal Society's council. He published in the Philosophical Transactions a paper on an earthquake of 1750.A Letter from Mr. Peter Newcome F. R. S. to the President, concerning the Same Shock Being Felt at Hackney, Near London (January 1, 1753). Newcome took over the school on his father's death.

He previously held dual Polish-South African citizenship from 1986 until his South African citizenship was revoked in 2017. Walu≈õ is, , serving a life sentence in C-Max in Pretoria for the 1993 assassination of Chris Hani, General Secretary of the South African Communist Party and chief of staff of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC). He was refused parole for the third time on 7 October 2019, despite his lawyer's claim that he is completely rehabilitated. Life Walu≈õ was born in Zakopane in Communist-ruled Poland and, in 1981, emigrated to South Africa to join his father and brother. They had arrived in South Africa in the 1970s and established a small glass factory. After the family business went bankrupt some years later, Walu≈õ, then a truck driver, joined both the National Party and the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, becoming more and more involved in the far right politics supporting South Africa's apartheid regime. The assassination of Chris Hani took place on Easter Saturday, 10 April 1993, a time when negotiations to end apartheid were taking place.Murder with a Political Motive. Economic and Political Weekly. 1993 Walu≈õ drove to Chris Hani's house in Boksburg, Johannesburg, around 10:20 am. Hani had just returned home and, as he got out of his car, Walu≈õ called out his name, at which Hani turned around and was shot once in the body and then three times in the head. Hani died on the scene, while Walu≈õ fled. A neighbour noted the registration of the car fleeing the scene, which resulted in Walu≈õ's capture. Although Walu≈õ denied any participation in the assassination, he made the mistake of assuming one of the policemen was a right-winger and exposed his own story. Thorough investigation revealed that Clive Derby-Lewis had instigated the assassination and organized the acquisition of the weapon for Walu≈õ. The police found a hit-list that suggested Hani was only the third on Walu≈õ's and Derby-Lewis's list, which also included the names and addresses of Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo, among others. Janusz Walu≈õ and Clive Derby-Lewis were sentenced to death for their actions, but after the abolition of the death penalty in South Africa their sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. With the introduction of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission after apartheid, Walu≈õ applied for amnesty, which would give him parole. After extensive investigation the commission found that he and Derby-Lewis were not acting on higher orders and refused amnesty; he remained in prison. Clive Derby-Lewis was released from prison in June 2015 after serving 22 years; he died over a year later, on November 3, 2016, from lung cancer. On 10 March 2016, the High Court in Pretoria ruled that Walu≈õ should be released on parole. The Department of Home Affairs indicated in September 2016 that Walu≈õ would be stripped of his South African citizenship and deported back to Poland if he was released on parole. In May 2017, Justice Minister Michael Masutha introduced an application to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein to overturn Walu≈õ's parole. Meeting on 29 May, the court reserved judgment in the case, citing a procedural irregularity involving the Hani family's victim impact statement. During the hearing, Walu≈õ's advocate, Roelof du Plessis, stated that his client's South African citizenship had been revoked by the Department of Home Affairs \\"just a few weeks\\" earlier, and that a warrant for his deportation had been issued. On 18 August 2017, the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned Walu≈õ's parole, a decision that was welcomed by the SACP. On 16 March 2020, Walu≈õ was again denied parole by Justice Minister Ronald Lamola. Aftermath Walu≈õ has become a symbol for the Far-right in Poland. They glorify what he did and admire him for trying to stop Communism in South Africa. Football fans in Poland were seen carrying scarves with his photo, bearing the hashtag StayStrongBrother, amid calls for his release. There is even a song calling for his release.

The Lerma shared parts with other vehicles by VAM's license partner American Motors (AMC) to cut down manufacturing costs. It was VAM's top-of-the-line flagship model, which the company did not have since the discontinuation of the Classic (Matador) line in 1976. The VAM Lerma was unusual in offering a hatchback design focused at the top-end luxury market. The model was an indirect replacement of the VAM Classic and to some extent the VAM Pacer lines. History The name for the cars was taken from Lerma, a city in the state of Mexico, where VAM engines were manufactured.Jos√© Luis Alarc√≥n Vela. \\"√ârase una vez un auto mexicano...\\" (Once upon a time a Mexican car...) El Universal, Mexico. September 11, 2004, retrieved on August 3, 2008. The made in Mexico Lerma was a unique hybrid since it used a chassis and some body panels from the AMC Concord sedan, but the rear of the car featured the AMC Spirit's hatchback design. Although the finished Lerma units were single unit body design (monocoque), a British newspaper article described it as \\"a bolt-together kit of a car\\". This is actually confusion in regards to the part of the Lerma production process which was made by hand labor, cutting existing mass production panels (as well as manually creating new panels) and welding them together to create a final single unit body. There were two body styles available, a 3-door hatchback and a 5-door hatchback (a body style not available for any of AMC's models at that time). The designs were presented to AMC's management as a potential model, but it would have less cargo capacity than the Concord wagon and the company had other priorities at the time. Considered for other international markets, the Lerma was marketed only in Mexico starting in 1981, and competed in an expanding market segment that at the time was considered the way of the future, the four-door hatchback market. The Lerma's most remarkable and striking hatchback design feature also proved to be its biggest drawback, because the built-in closed trunk resulted in a car with a very limited space for storage. Nevertheless, between 1981 and 1983 it represented VAM's entry in the most exclusive luxury market. Arguably, the VAM Lerma was the first successful fully Mexican sedan. Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos is remembered as the first Mexican automotive company that created a car that is regarded by many as totally national. With the exception of the instrument panel, the interior of the Lerma did not share several parts with other models and featured uniquely designed and upholstered seats as well as interior door panels. Style and Equipment The 1981 VAM Lerma was available as a single edition and carried a VAM I6 engine with Motorcraft two-barrel carburetor, 8.0:1 compression ratio and 266 degree camshaft designed by VAM's engineering department. It was rated at at 3900 rpm and torque of of torque at 2200 rpm. The only transmission was the Chrysler Torque-Flyte A998 three-speed automatic with 3.07 rear differential gear ratio. Suspension consisted of a front independent design with coil springs with stiff shocks and front sway bar while the rear design incorporated leaf springs with stiff shock absorbers. Brakes were power-assisted units with front disks and rear drums. The cooling system incorporated a three-line radiator, flexible seven-bladed fan, fan shroud and coolant recovery tank. The car carried the same 70 liter (18.5 gallon) fuel tank as the American line. Tire specification was ER78x14. Interiors were available in four colors: black, nut brown, sky blue, and wine red. With the only exceptions of the A and C-pillar inner plastic moldings, the windshield and rear hatch inner plastic surrounding moldings, the door latches, the door cranks, the side armrests, the door ashtrays, the steering wheel and column plus the dashboard the rest of the interior is 100% made and designed in Mexico by VAM's styling department. The most striking features of the Lerma's interior design relied on its door panels, side panels, trunk and seats. The first two incorporated high trim fabric and lower portion horizontal carpet inserts with fake horizontal chrome (lower portion) and woodgrain (upper portion) moldings. The seats consisted of a fixed rear bench seat and individual recling front wide bucket seats with adjustable headrests. The pattern on these seats is nothing short of impressive, incorporating a design of four squared buttons forming another square over the seat bottoms and backs. These portions are actually outer ones over the main body of the seat and is not stretched out, giving the feeling and impression of having a cushion over both the main seat bottom and back. The bases of both sets of seats are covered in carpet. The VAM Lerma was the only four-door VAM car not to incorporate a fixed front bench seat, making it also the only four-door VAM car to incorporate individual (reclining) front seats. The Lerma's trunk is unique among VAM (and AMC) cars alike. It is a closed compartment covered in carpet and incorporated both rear stereo speakers at each side of the lid. The lid itself is hinged to the back of the frame near the rear seat back and had a fixed rear light similar to the ones used in the hood, it would flick on and off depending on the position of the lid. Despite how truly elegant the trunk looked, its design made to follow the side lines of the interior of the car as well as the dimensions of the massive rear hatch glass ended up creating a truly low amount of trunk space for barely anything other than the spare tire. This situation forced owners to buy an external roof rack fixed to the side drip rails in order to be able to carry any luggage, which might compromise the looks of the car. In the exterior, the VAM Lerma showed its influence from the Concord and Spirit models it was based on. The most unusual parts being the rear quarter panels, the rear side windows, the squared grid grille design divided into two sets of four horizontal rectangular portions (not shared with any other VAM car), the gold and black VAM logo on the hood ornament, the manuscript \\"Lerma\\" emblems over both fenders and right corner of the hatch. One final detail would be added in the middle of the year production; the round side marker lights used in the Rally (Spirit) models were replaced by rectangular units with chrome surrounding area for a more luxurious appearance. The Lerma incorporated an exclusive design of side protective moldings running through most of the length of the car placed higher than the regular moldings. A bright molding package was standard consisting of wheel lips moldings, drip rail moldings, rocker panel moldings, as well as the already chromed bumpers, dual squared chromed mirrors plus the rear glass and windshield moldings. The wheels used by the model was VAM's in-house five spoke 14x6 units complemented by AMC's \\"Noryl\\" wheelcover design. The full length of the Lerma was only two inches shorter than that of the VAM American (Concord) sedan models. Convenience standard accessories included power steering, tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, woodgrain panels applied on dashboard, luxury steering wheel, heater with front defroster, Quartz clock, 180 km/h-110 mph speedometer, water temperature and gasoline level gauges, warning lights with international symbols, inside hood release, rear defroster, lighted vanity mirror on passenger's side sunvisor, AM FM stereo radio with four speakers, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, parcel shelf, complete light group (hood, trunk, front ashtray, glovebox, courtesy, reading dome light), dual remote-controlled remote mirrors (non- electric), three-point retractable front seatbelts, side armrest safety reflectors on front doors, dual rear ashtrays, spare tire cover and locking gas cap. Optional equipment included air conditioning system, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, electric antenna, power seats, tilt steering column, headers. Reception The introduction of the VAM Lerma in 1981 was an unexpected move for the whole of the auto industry, creating absolute amazement. Despite the fact that the car was a design based on two previously existing body styles originated in a different country, instead of an all-new body made from a scratch exclusively by Mexican designers and engineers, a feat like the conception and materialization of an original automobile had never been attempted before in the Mexican auto industry. VAM was well known for creating original design features such as interiors (seats and side panels, with special mentions for the 1976 Cassini and Recaro-type Rally designs), body accents (wheels, hubcaps, emblems, vinyl roof treatments, decal designs plus C-pillar porthole opera windows and B-pillar opera windows like the 1977 GFS design that was adopted by AMC for the Concord two-door), and all-new completely-original editions for the Mexican market by Mexicans (Rambler Go Pack two-door sedan, Classic Brougham hardtop, Classic AMX coupe, American 06/S Concord two-door sedan, 1979 Pacer X coupe, 1979-1982 Gremlin X Spirit sedans, and all 1969-1983 Rally models), aside from the known engineering achievements (such as the 4.6/X, 4.6 SX and Go Pack 282 inline six cylinder engines as well as the standard 252 and 282 units). The creation of the Lerma was the highest next step taken by the company. Despite the novelty and uniqueness the Lerma represented, its performance on the market was much lower than expected by a series of factors. The first of them was the price of the model, being almost on par with the luxury V8 compacts of the competition. The high price also created a problem with several company dealerships that were not able to sell the car because of it. This caused less exposure to customers, which also were not used to a VAM car being part of that market range. The Lerma's styling, while perceived as nice by the general customer base, was also perceived as too plain for a luxury vehicle. While the front and rear of the car were considered acceptable, the sides were cosmatically almost too smooth and monotonous. The chrome treatment VAM chose for the Lerma was considered insufficient. The aspect that is considered the greatest cause for the Lerma to draw customers away was the almost non-existent trunk space, making it impractical. Finally, the marketing campaign could have been better. Both the Mexican government and public at the time contributed their shares to the partial failure of the VAM Lerma; the auto industry legislation created by the Mexican government in the early 1960s in regards to a limited number of car lines per marque (three) and the number of body styles per line of products always created a limited number of choices for the Mexican buyer. These limitations forced the auto makers in Mexico to consolidate lines of models and trim levels; mostly opting to offer mid-segment models and semiequipped versions with only a couple low or high end exceptions. In regards to body styles, this situation caused that the smallest most affordable models offered by automakers in Mexico were always the second to the smallest and most basic ones in their home countries. One example of this through the 1970s was that Ford Motor Company's smallest most affordable model was the Pinto in the United States while Ford de M√©xico's smallest most affordable model was the Maverick. This meant that in most cases an automaker's smallest most affordable model in Mexico was a compact notchback sedan in either two or four doors, while in their countries of origin there was the possibility of a subcompact hatchback. Under these circumstances, the Mexican public was very accustomed to notchback body styles, making hatchback designs a lot less common and almost unthinkable for a high-end luxury market. Cars like the Volkswagen Caribe (Rabbit) and VAM's own Gremlin and Pacer models had helped to change the trend gradually but by 1981 it was still not enough. People in Mexico at the time were mostly against paying the price of a luxury car for a hatchback. It would be exaggerated to call the Lerma a failure. The tooling costs of the model were very low as VAM did its finest to use the most of the existing parts and components as possible. The interior door and side panels were shared with the high trim models American GFS, American ECD and Camioneta American DL of the same year. The only interior components not shared with other VAM cars were limited to the trunk, the seats and the headliner. The only exterior components exclusive to the VAM Lerma were the grille, the rear side windows and the protective moldings. The initial sales of the model were enough to regain the investment and it ended up being profitable for the company. The development process of the model was an extremely valuable experience for the company. 610 and 620 Learning from the experience of its first year, VAM offered a substantially changed and updated Lerma model for 1982. In the exterior, the squared grid grille design divided in rectangles was replaced by an all-new totally chromed metal grille with a simple design of thin horizontal stripes with equally thin spaces between them. The headlight bezels were completely blacked out in their internal parts with only their external surrounding portions retaining a chromed appearance. The front parking lights were changed from transparent to amber. Both bumpers received AMC's Eagle thick nerfing strip design with a central bright molding and new VAM-designed plain smooth bumper end caps continuing the bright molding on their upper portions. On both sides, changes were more noticeable. The bright molding on the rocker panels was retained and new moldings with a six horizontal stripe pattern were fitted to the bottom edges of the front fenders, doors and sides. The wheel lip and drip rail bright moldings remained unchanged while new additional bright moldings appeared in the form of units one the bases of the door and side glass areas as well as new bright moldings for the internal part of the door and side window frames. The trim plate between the side glass (two-door model) or between the rear door and side glass (four-door model) was changed in favor of a new plate following the same six striped pattern as the low side moldings. This plate existed only in the two-door model in 1981 but it was present in both body styles for 1982. The small angular mid side window of the 1981 two- door model was replaced by the normal unit used since the two-door AMC Hornet and two-door AMC Concord base models. The five-spoke VAM wheels with Noryl- type wheelcovers were replaced by new aluminum wheels with chromed volcano centercaps and lug nuts. All of these changes resulted in a highly different Lerma model that looked fairly more luxurious on the outside compared to smoothness of the 1981 version. The interior saw an amount of changes and upgrades that was as long as the ones on the outside. The most noticeable difference is the deletion of the trunk, leaving a completely open compartment that carried a standard small high-pressure space-saver spare tire. The removal of the trunk meant the relocation of the rear stereo speakers to the rear panel behind the tail lights like in the Rally (Spirit liftback) models. The original fixed Lerma rear bench seat was replaced by the same unit used in the Camioneta American (Concord wagon) incorporating a fold down mechanism for an improved and expanded cargo capacity, retaining its unique original Lerma upholstery design. In terms of appearance, both seats and side panel designs were the same as the year before with only smaller added details for a slightly more luxurious look. Mechanically, the Lerma for 1982 was almost the same as in 1981. The only differences came in the form a different head gasket for the 4.6 Liter engine that brought compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1. The standard A998 three-speed automatic transmission got wider gear ratios. The final technical change came in the midyear with a new head design with larger rounder intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets; making a more powerful engine. After giving the Lerma the correct appearance for a luxury car -at least for the preferences of the Mexican buyer- and correcting the error of the limited trunk space, VAM proceeded to solve the problem of the price. The company achieved a solution by creating two different trim levels for the model, the lower-priced intermediate \\"Lerma 610\\" and the upscale top- of-the-line \\"Lerma 620\\". Despite their focus and advertisement, both versions were almost the same, the differences between each were limited to only five different standard accessories. The Lerma 610 was equipped with two-speed electric wipers, round dome light, heater with windshield defroster, plain passenger's side sun visor and a plain rear hatch glass. The Lerma 620 incorporated intermittent wipers, reading dome light, air conditioning, vanity mirror on passenger's side sun visor and rear wiper and washer. All five additional accessories of the 620 models could be ordered separately in the 610 models. Cosmetically and mechanically, both the 610 and 620 Lerma were equal with the only exception of the visually noticeable presence of the rear wiper. A move orchestrated by the Mexican government that in the end turned out to be equivocated took its toll on the Lerma as a luxury model and also on all of its competitors. Luxury automotive accessories were mostly among the percentage of imported automotive components by all of the Mexican auto industry. In an effort to reduce importation, the government banned the acquisition of luxury automotive accessories in an effort to have them produced or sourced locally. This meant an inevitable reduction in the lists of both standard and optional equipment. In the first, the Lerma lost the Quartz digital clock, the rear defroster and the \\"Noryl\\" wheelcovers. The extra-charge equipment list no longer offered power door locks, power windows, power seats, power trunk release and tilt steering column. Items that were standard in 1981 and survived became optional in 1982 in the form of the remote-controlled exterior mirrors. The full list of optional equipment for the 1982 VAM Lerma 620 consisted of electric antenna, tape player AM FM stereo radio, remote controlled mirrors, headers and sports steel wheels. The new aluminum wheels for 1982 were practically a replacement of the previous year's wheelcovers while the new-for-the rear wiper and washer took the place of the rear defroster. End of the line The recession that broke out in February 1982 swept the whole of the Mexican auto industry. The devaluation of the Mexican peso coupled with the currency flight took VAM's parent company, the FISOMEX conglomerate, almost to brink of bankruptcy. At the current situation, the best possible course of action left was to sell the company and Renault de M√©xico stepped in. Due to the additional required time for the hand labor stage of the Lerma production process, the new owner determined the discontinuation of the Lerma line. The short run of the 1983 VAM passenger car line consisted of the base and mid segment American, Gremlin and Rally models like in 1980. Reportedly, leftover 1982 Lerma 610 and 620 units were sold as 1983 models. Stirling engine A VAM Lerma served as test vehicle for the Stirling engine. It was an alternatives to the traditional engines and converted to an experimental P-40 engine. The Lerma was used to inform the public about the Stirling engine.

Fireproof Games, a division of the company, acts as video game developer. The company is best known for its The Room series of puzzle video games, of which the first, The Room (2012), was named \\"Best British Game\\" at the 2013 British Academy Games Awards, and sold over two million copies as of May 2013.  History  Fireproof Studios was founded on 3 September 2008 by Christopher Cannon, Tony Cartwright, Mark Hamilton, Barry Meade, David Rack and Damien Leigh Rayfield. The six founders were formerly employed by Criterion Games and met while working on Burnout 3 and developed the idea of working as a team during work on Burnout Paradise. The studio was intended to be a freelance art studio, but eventually started creating its own games. Fireproof Studios credited LittleBigPlanet creator Media Molecule, who outsourced art creation for LittleBigPlanet downloadable content and LittleBigPlanet 2 to Fireproof Studios, as a major help during their first two years. Fireproof Studios worked closely with Guerrilla Games to provide the art for multiplayer levels within Killzone Shadow Fall and Killzone: Mercenary. Fireproof Studios has also contributed art and assets to Ridge Racer Unbounded, the DJ Hero series, and Kinect Sesame Street TV. In 2012, Fireproof Studios opened a division, Fireproof Games, that would focus on video game development. Their first game was The Room, and they have since developed three sequels to the game by 2018, building their team to about 17 employees. They also currently working on a new title unrelated to The Room games. The Room series Fireproof's principal product have been a series of puzzle games called The Room. As of 2020, there have been five titles in the series, first released for mobile devices (iOS and Android), and have seen selected ports to Microsoft Windows and the Nintendo Switch, with the most recent game being released exclusively for virtual reality. Each game involves a series of highly detailed virtual puzzle boxes, which the player sees from a first-person perspective, giving them the ability to zoom in and out and move around the puzzle box to locate its features. Each puzzle box requires the player to manipulate elements on the box to access hidden caches or mechanisms as to explore the contents of each box further. Manipulation of these elements are done via the device's touchscreen (or in the case of Windows, through the mouse interface), such as turning handles or sliding boxes. The game's mythos involves a fifth classical element called \\"Null\\" which has the ability to bend reality and warp the mind of those in contact with it. Some portions of these boxes are constructed from Null. The player can tap a special icon to wear an eyepiece that lets them see into the Null to discover hidden information or manipulate parts of the puzzle box. Each game in the series generally has several puzzles, with a narrative of the player following in the footsteps of one that previously had been in contact with the Null, leaving notes behind that become more and more deranged with each puzzle. The first game, The Room took six months to develop and was released in September 2012 by Fireproof Games. It was featured as editor's choice on its release and later named the iPad Game of the Year for 2012. At the 2012 British Academy Video Games Awards, The Room won the award for Best British Game, as well as being nominated in the Mobile & Handheld, Artistic Achievement and Debut Game categories. By May 2013, The Room sold over two million copies. Following the success of the first game they began development of a sequel, The Room Two, which was released on iPad on 12 December 2013. Fireproof Games released The Room Two to iOS and Android devices in early 2014. A second sequel, The Room Three, was released for mobile devices in November 2015. In August 2017, Fireproof Games noted on their social media that they had \\"no immediate plans\\" to bring the game to Microsoft Windows, as they did with the previous episodes, but later amended that they were \\"hoping to get that done\\" in the second half of 2018.

It aired on May 12, 2013 and serves as the second-season finale of the series. The episode was written by Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz and directed by Dean White. The episode was watched by 7.33 million American viewers, and was given mixed reviews from professional critics. In this episode, Emma Swan, her parents, Regina, Henry, and Hook try to stop Greg and Tamara, while flashbacks show Hook's past with Baelfire. Plot Opening Sequence Neverland appears in the enchanted forest. In the Characters' Past In the hours after they pulled Baelfire out of the water and onto the Jolly Roger, Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) tells Mr. Smee that he still wants to avenge Milah's death by going after Rumplestilskin, becomes intrigued by their latest catch, not knowing that Bae is Milah and Rumplstiltskin's son. While Baelfire is not happy being rescued by a pirate, Hook, who now has found out who his father is, thinks he may have found the opportunity. While they ponder whether or not to send him back to Neverland, Hook tells Smee that Bae would make an excellent pirate for his crew. But it appears that the Lost Boys have shown up at the Jolly Roger, eager to get their hands on Baelfire, warning Hook the Shadow will tear his ship apart if they do not hand over Baelfire. But they come up empty-handed thanks to Bae holding his breath in a secret compartment. As the two bond, it appears that they formed a good relationship, with Hook showing Bae how to navigate the ship, even carving markings to show him the directions. Hook asks Bae about his family, who told him that his mother was killed by a pirate, and that his father changed after he became the Dark One, while Hook reveals that he also lost his father, who abandoned him so he wouldn't be captured by the authorities. Later on, after Bae recognizes Milah's picture after looking at his desk, he turns on Hook, who now knows that he is Rumplestiltskin's son. Hook then explains to Bae that Rumplestiltskin was the one that killed Milah and that she regretted leaving Bae. Despite knowing the truth, Bae is still angry with Hook for splitting up his family. Bae tells Hook that he wants to go back to the Darling family, but Hook says that they cannot go back, then responds with, \\"This ship can be your home, your family ... it's not too late to start over. I can change, Bae, for you.\\" Unfortunately, Bae turns him down, believing that Hook is only thinking of himself. But moments later, the Lost Boys show up to grab Bae, because Hook has made a deal with them. As they take off with Bae, Hook feels that he disappointed himself by giving up Bae, so he crosses out the marking he made. Later, the Lost Ones compare Bae to a drawing and, since he is not a match, declare that he will live but will be held captive. The drawing shows that Henry Mills is the individual sought by the shadow; they got him, but before conception and birth. The leader says that he will show up, as \\"Peter Pan never fails.\\" In Storybrooke At the park, Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) walks up to see Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) playing on a swing, with Granny (Beverley Elliott) and her crossbow keeping watch. Gold, still believing Henry will be his undoing, uses magic to fray the rope of the swing so that Henry will hit the rocks. Before this can happen, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), David (Josh Dallas), and Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) arrive to tell him and Henry the news that Tamara shot Neal and he fell into the portal. Gold blames himself for losing his son again and, when they tell him about the danger, refuses to help them save Storybrooke. Meanwhile, in the mines, Tamara (Sonequa Martin-Green), Greg (Ethan Embry), and Hook set the diamond on a rock. Then Greg uses Happy's pickaxe to trigger the device that will destroy the town and revert it to a forest. However, Hook, seeing that they have something else planned, decides not to be involved with their destruction of \\"his kind.\\" Back at Mary Margaret's apartment, Regina (Lana Parrilla) wakes up and is greeted warmly by Henry, who is excited to see her again. As an exploding sound is heard, Regina tells them that the device has been activated and she can only slow it down. Hook then shows up to offer assistance, and after he gets an earful from everyone, including a punch in the face from David, all parties agree that they should set aside their differences. Regina tells Henry that she is to blame for what is happening, also saying to him that she will love him no matter what, then tells him \\"Good Bye\\" before they all leave. As Greg and Tamara try to destroy all evidence so they can escape, David and Hook arrive to stop them. When Greg sees them, he is slowed down by Hook and drops the beans while Tamara takes aim at David. But as soon as David catches up with Tamara, Greg attacks him, and the couple escapes with the magic beans. Hook stops David just in time to show them that he has one of the beans that they can use. Meanwhile, at the pawn shop, Gold discovers that the dwarves have taken one of the steins which they are using to restore Sneezy's memory before the destruction takes place. It turns out that the Blue Fairy has found a way to bring everyone's true memories back thanks to her restoring August back to Pinocchio. Leroy then gives Gold an elixir that he can use to bring back Belle (Emilie de Ravin). Later on, a depressed Gold looks on as Lacey continues to drink, prompting him to take out the broken cup from the cabinet and restore it to normal. He then pours the elixir into the cup and gives it to Lacey to drink, and she regains her memory as Belle. The two then hug each other. As Regina and Emma head down to the mine, they see the diamond. Regina tells her that she can only slow down the destruction, not stop it. Containing the power of the trigger will take all of Regina's energy, killing her. But Emma discovers that Regina is willing to die because everyone sees her as the Evil Queen and she does not want Henry to think she is evil. As Regina then takes control of the device, Emma returns to Granny's to tell Mary Margaret, Hook, and David about what Regina is planning to do. Henry's insistence that they help Regina prompts Mary Margaret to remember how they had sent the wraith into the portal. Therefore, they can use the bean to send the device away from Storybrooke. Hook agrees to hand over the bean to Emma, but only after learning that Neal is Henry's father. As Emma, Mary Margaret, Henry, and David arrive to see a weakening Regina, Emma attempts to take out the bean, but the pouch is empty. Realizing that Hook tricked her as he has taken the bean in an attempt to escape Storybrooke, Emma looks at her family and then hugs them while Henry looks at Regina and calls her a hero and hugs her. This is also the moment Emma refers to Mary Margaret and David as \\"Mom\\" and \\"Dad\\" for the first time. Emma realizes she can help Regina by using her own magic, and as they work together the device is deactivated, resulting in Storybrooke returning to normal. But as they all celebrate saving the town from being destroyed, Emma notices Henry's backpack on the floor. He was kidnapped by Greg and Tamara, who used the device to distract the town so they could take Henry, whom they see as more valuable than magic. As Emma, Regina, Mary Margaret, and David catch up to stop them, Tamara takes out a bean and opens up a portal in the water to make their escape. The foursome are too late, but all of a sudden Hook and his ship return. He tells them he that he has had a change of heart and wants to help them find Henry and gives Emma the bean. They are then joined by Gold and Belle, who also want to join in the search. But Gold tells Belle that she must stay in Storybrooke now that they know that there are others out there that want to destroy their world. So, he gives her a spell that will cloak the town. The two kiss before he climbs aboard, after he admits he does not expect to return. Now that everyone has agreed to a truce, especially Gold and Hook, Gold conjures up his magic globe and pricks his finger, using the blood to locate Henry. After Hook throws the bean into the ocean, the ship enters the swirling portal to Neverland. In the Enchanted Forest Mulan (Jamie Chung), Aurora (Sarah Bolger), and a restored Prince Phillip (Julian Morris) discover an unconscious Neal (Michael Raymond-James) on a beach, gravely injured but alive. Production \\"And Straight On 'til Morning\\" was co-written by series creators Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz, while Dean White served as the episode's director. Cultural references The plot of this episode has parallels to Peter Pan in its focus on Hook, Neverland setting, introduction of the Lost Boys and mention of Peter Pan. Beauty & The Beast is referenced when Belle's dark side is restored to her normal self by drinking from the chipped cup. Reception Ratings The outing held steady from the previous episode, placing a 2.2/7 among 18-49s with 7.33 million viewers tuning in, down from the 9.66 million it had from the first-season finale.\\"TV Ratings Sunday: 'Revenge' Finale Dips, 'Once' Flat + 'Cleveland' Slides & 'Celebrity Apprentice' Hits Low\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (May 13, 2013) Reviews The finale received positive reviews from critics. Hilary Busis from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a positive, yet somewhat mild review: \\"So, was Once‚Äôs second season finale as momentous as its first? The short answer: Not really. The long answer: Last year‚Äôs juiciest finale developments -- Emma breaking the Dark Curse and Rumpelstiltskin bringing magic back to Storybrooke -- changed the show‚Äôs status quo for good, setting up a world of new and exciting possibilities. By contrast, Henry‚Äôs kidnapping and his dysfunctional family‚Äôs subsequent journey to Neverland aren‚Äôt really game-changers. In the short term, at least, they‚Äôre simply setting up a season 3 that's much like season 2: a sprawling exercise in world-jumping and cross-cutting that trades one big goal (break the curse!) for several smaller, slightly less pressing goals (find Henry! Protect Storybrooke from outsiders! Figure out what Red‚Äôs been up to for the past six months!).\\"\\"'Once Upon a Time' recap: Little Boy Lost\\" from Entertainment Weekly (May 12, 2013) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the finale a 9 out of 10.http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/13/once-upon-a-time-and-straight-on- til-morning-review EW ranked Lacey number two for \\"Most Welcome Exit for an Unloved Character,\\" Emma's saving Regina at number two for \\"Single Weakest Twist,\\" and number three for \\"Next Year's Season Pass is Now in Jeopardy\\" for the 2013 TV Season Finale Awards.

Besides the geodesics principle in a classical field theory there exists Fermat's principle for stationary gravity fields.  Fermat's principle  In case of conformally stationary spacetime with coordinates (t,x^1,x^2,x^3) a Fermat metric takes the form :g=e^{2f(t,x)}[(dt+\\\\phi_{\\\\alpha}(x)dx^{\\\\alpha})^{2}-\\\\hat{g}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} dx^{\\\\alpha} dx^{\\\\beta}], where the conformal factor f(t,x) depends on time t and space coordinates x^{\\\\alpha} and does not affect the lightlike geodesics apart from their parametrization. Fermat's principle for a pseudo-Riemannian manifold states that the light ray path between points x_a=(x^1_a,x^2_a,x^3_a) and x_b=(x^1_b,x^2_b,x^3_b) corresponds to stationary action. :S=\\\\int^{\\\\mu_a}_{\\\\mu_b}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\hat{g}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\frac{dx^{\\\\alpha}}{d\\\\mu} \\\\frac{dx^{\\\\beta}}{d\\\\mu}}+\\\\phi_{\\\\alpha}(x)\\\\frac{dx^{\\\\alpha}}{d\\\\mu} \\\\right) d\\\\mu, where \\\\mu is any parameter ranging over an interval [\\\\mu_a, \\\\mu_b] and varying along curve with fixed endpoints x_a=x(\\\\mu_a) and x_b=x(\\\\mu_b). Principle of stationary integral of energy  In principle of stationary integral of energy for a light-like particle's motion , the pseudo-Riemannian metric with coefficients \\\\tilde{g}_{ij} is defined by a transformation : \\\\tilde{g}_{00} =\\\\rho ^{2}{g}_{00} ,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\tilde{g}_{0k}=\\\\rho{g}_{0k} ,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\tilde{g}_{kq} ={g}_{kq} . With time coordinate x^0 and space coordinates with indexes k,q=1,2,3 the line element is written in form : ds^2=\\\\rho^2 g_{00}(dx^{0})^{2}+ 2\\\\rho g_{0k}dx^{0}dx^{k}+g_{kq}dx^{k}dx^{q}, where \\\\rho is some quantity, which is assumed equal 1 and regarded as the energy of the light-like particle with ds=0. Solving this equation for \\\\rho under condition g_{00} e 0 gives two solutions :\\\\rho =\\\\frac{-g_{0k} v^{k} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{(g_{0k} g_{0q} -g_{00} g_{kq})v^{k} v^{q} } }{g_{00} v^{0} }, where v^{i}=dx^i/d\\\\mu are elements of the four-velocity. Even if one solution, in accordance with making definitions, is \\\\rho=1 . With g_{00}=0 and g_{0k} e 0 even if for one k the energy takes form :\\\\rho =-\\\\frac{g_{kq} v^{k} v^{q} }{2v_{0} v^{0}}. In both cases for the free moving particle the Lagrangian is :L= -\\\\rho. Its partial derivatives give the canonical momenta :p_{\\\\lambda}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial v^{\\\\lambda}}=\\\\frac{v_{\\\\lambda}}{v^{0}v_{0}} and the forces : F_{\\\\lambda}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial L }{\\\\partial x^{\\\\lambda}}=\\\\frac{1}{2v^{0}v_{0}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^{\\\\lambda}}v^{i}v^{j}. Momenta satisfy energy condition for closed system :\\\\rho=v^{\\\\lambda}p_{\\\\lambda}-L. Standard variational procedure according to Hamilton's principle is applied to action : S=\\\\int^{\\\\mu_a}_{\\\\mu_b}L d\\\\mu=-\\\\int^{\\\\mu_a}_{\\\\mu_b}\\\\rho d\\\\mu, which is integral of energy. Stationary action is conditional upon zero variational derivatives and leads to Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations :\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\mu}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho }{\\\\partial v^{\\\\lambda}}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho }{\\\\partial x^{\\\\lambda}}=0, which is rewritten in form :\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\mu} p_{\\\\lambda}-F_{\\\\lambda}=0. After substitution of canonical momentum and forces they give motion equations of lightlike particle in a free space :\\\\frac{dv^{0}}{d\\\\mu}+\\\\frac{v^{0}}{2v_{0}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^{0}}v^{i}v^{j}=0 and : (g_{k\\\\lambda} v_{0}-g_{0k}v_{\\\\lambda})\\\\frac{dv^{k}}{d\\\\mu}+\\\\left[v_{0}\\\\Gamma_{0ij}-v_{\\\\lambda}\\\\Gamma_{\\\\lambda ij}\\\\right]v^i v^j=0, where \\\\Gamma_{kij} are the Christoffel symbols of the first kind and indexes \\\\lambda take values 1,2,3.  Static spacetime  For the isotropic paths a transformation to metric \\\\overline{g}_{ij}=g_{ij}/{g_{00}} is equivalent to replacement of parameter \\\\mu on d\\\\overline{\\\\mu}=d\\\\mu/\\\\sqrt{g_{00}} to which the four-velocities \\\\overline{v}^{i}=dx^i/d\\\\overline{\\\\mu} correspond. The curve of motion of lightlike particle in four-dimensional spacetime and value of energy \\\\rho are invariant under this reparametrization. For the static spacetime the first equation of motion with appropriate parameter \\\\overline \\\\mu gives \\\\overline v^0=1 . Canonical momentum and forces take form :\\\\overline{p}_{\\\\lambda}=\\\\overline v_{\\\\lambda}; \\\\qquad \\\\overline{F}_{\\\\lambda}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{g}_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^{\\\\lambda}}\\\\overline{v}^{i}\\\\overline{v}^{j}. Substitution of them in Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations gives :\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\mu}\\\\left(\\\\overline{g}_{\\\\lambda k} \\\\overline{v}^k\\\\right)=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{g}_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^{\\\\lambda}}\\\\overline{v}^{i}\\\\overline{v}^{j}. After differentiation on the left side and multiplying by \\\\overline{g}^{l \\\\lambda} this expression, after the summation over the repeated index \\\\lambda, becomes null geodesic equations :\\\\frac{d^2 x^l}{d\\\\overline{\\\\mu}^2}+\\\\Gamma^l_{ij} \\\\frac{dx^i}{d\\\\overline{\\\\mu}}\\\\frac{dx^j}{d\\\\overline{\\\\mu}}=0, where \\\\Gamma^l_{ij} are the second kind Christoffel symbols with respect to the metric tensor \\\\overline{g}_{ij}. So in case of the static spacetime the geodesic principle and the energy variational method as well as Fermat's principle give the same solution for the light propagation. Generalized Fermat's principle  In the generalized Fermat‚Äôs principle the time is used as a functional and together as a variable. It is applied Pontryagin‚Äôs minimum principle of the optimal control theory and obtained an effective Hamiltonian for the light-like particle motion in a curved spacetime. It is shown that obtained curves are null geodesics. The identity of the generalized Fermat principles and the stationary energy integral of a light-like particle for velocities is proved . The virtual displacements of coordinates retain path of the light-like particle to be null in the pseudo-Riemann space-time, i.e. not lead to the Lorentz-invariance violation in locality and corresponds to the variational principles of mechanics. The equivalence of the solutions given by the first principle, to the geodesics, means that the using the second also turns out geodesics. The stationary energy integral principle gives a system of equations that has one equation more. It makes possible to uniquely determine canonical momenta of the particle and forces acting on it in a given reference frame.

The RSC index is used to find the suitability of the water for irrigation in clay soils which have a high cation exchange capacity. When dissolved sodium in comparison with dissolved calcium and magnesium is high in water, clay soil swells or undergoes dispersion which drastically reduces its infiltration capacity.Managing irrigation water quality, Oregon State University, USA, Retrieved on 2012-10-04. In the dispersed soil structure, the plant roots are unable to spread deeper into the soil due to lack of moisture. However, high RSC index water does not enhance the osmotic pressure to impede the off take of water by the plant roots unlike high salinity water. Clay soils irrigation with high RSC index water leads to fallow alkali soils formation. Cross section of a mango tree with shallow roots in partially formed alkali soil RSC index formula RSC is expressed in meq/l units. RSC should not be higher than 1 and preferably less than +0.5 for considering the water use for irrigation.US Salinity Lab Handbook 60 The formula for calculating RSC index is: * RSC index = [HCO3 \\\\+ CO3] ‚àí [Ca + Mg] * RSC index = HCO3/61 + CO3/30 ‚Äì Ca/20 ‚Äì Mg/12 (in case the ionic concentrations are measured in mg/l or ppm as salts) While calculating RSC index, the water quality present at the root zone of the crop should be considered which would take into account the leaching factor in the field. Calcium present in dissolved form is also influenced by the partial pressure of dissolved CO2 at the plants root zone in the field water. Natural water contamination Global variation in soil pH. Red = acidic soil. Yellow = neutral soil. Blue = alkaline soil. Black = no data. Soda ash [Na2CO3] can be present in natural water from the weathering of basalt which is an igneous rock. Lime [Ca(OH)2] can be present in natural water when rain water comes in contact with calcined minerals such as ash produced from the burning of calcareous coal or lignite in boilers. Anthropogenic use of soda ash also finally adds to the RSC of the river water. Where the river water and ground water are repeatedly used in the extensively irrigated river basins, the river water available in lower reaches is often rendered not useful in agriculture due to high RSC index or alkalinity. The salinity of water need not be high. Softened water In industrial water treatment terminology, water quality with high RSC index is synonymous with the soft water but is chemically very different from naturally soft water which has a very low ionic concentration. When calcium and magnesium salts are present in dissolved form in water, these salts precipitate on the heat transfer surfaces forming insulating hard scaling / coating which reduces the heat transfer efficiency of the heat exchangers. To avoid scaling in water cooled heat exchangers, water is treated by lime and or soda ash to remove the water hardness. The following chemical reactions take place in lime soda softening process which precipitates the calcium and magnesium salts as calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide which have very low solubility in water. * CaSO4 \\\\+ Na2CO3 \\\\---> CaCO3‚Üì + Na2SO4 * CaCl2 \\\\+ Na2CO3 \\\\---> CaCO3‚Üì + 2NaCl * MgSO4 \\\\+ Ca(OH)2 \\\\+ Na2CO3 \\\\---> Mg(OH)2‚Üì + CaCO3‚Üì + Na2SO4 * MgCl2 \\\\+ Ca(OH)2 \\\\+ Na2CO3 \\\\---> Mg(OH)2‚Üì + CaCO3‚Üì + 2NaCl * 2NaHCO3 \\\\+ Ca(OH)2 \\\\---> CaCO3‚Üì + Na2CO3 \\\\+ 2H2O * Na2CO3 \\\\+ Ca(OH)2 \\\\---> CaCO3‚Üì + 2NaOH * Ca(HCO3)2 \\\\+ Ca(OH)2 \\\\---> 2CaCO3‚Üì + 2H2O * Mg(HCO3)2 \\\\+ 2Ca(OH)2 \\\\---> Mg(OH)2‚Üì + 2CaCO3‚Üì + 2H2O * MgCO3 \\\\+ Ca(OH)2 \\\\---> Mg(OH)2‚Üì + CaCO3‚Üì The excess soda ash after precipitating the calcium and magnesium salts is in carbonates & bicarbonates of sodium which imparts high pH or alkalinity to soil water. Soda lakes The endorheic basin lakes are called soda or alkaline lakes when the water inflows contain high concentrations of Na2CO3. The pH of the soda lake water is generally above 9 and sometimes the salinity is close to brackish water due to depletion of pure water by solar evaporation. Soda lakes are rich with algal growth due to enhanced availability of dissolved CO2 in the lake water compared to fresh water or saline water lakes. Sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide are in equilibrium with availability of dissolved carbon dioxide as given below in the chemical reaction * Na2CO3 \\\\+ H2O <=> 2NaOH + CO2 * NaHCO3 <=> NaOH + CO2 During day time when sun light is available, Algae undergoes photosynthesis process which absorbs CO2 to shift the reaction towards NaOH formation and vice versa takes place during night time with the release of CO2 from the respiration process of Algae towards Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 formation. In soda lake waters, carbonates of sodium act as catalyst for the algae growth by providing favourable higher concentration of dissolved CO2 during the day time. Due to fluctuation in dissolved CO2, the pH and alkalinity of the water also keep varying. .

Activities  The association organises an annual conference and an annual Tony Slaven Doctoral Workshop, named for Tony Slaven, one of the association's founders. It awards the annual Coleman Prize, named for business historian D. C. Coleman, for a recent Ph.D. thesis in the area of business history, and the Tony Slaven Grant.  History  The Association of Business Historians was founded in 1990 to promote the study of business history following on from the establishment of the Business Archives Council in 1934. T S Ashton regarded business history as ‚Äú simply a branch of economic history focusing on industry and the firm‚Äù. Even in the 1960s Peter Payne argued that business history was ‚Äúthat branch of economic history that finds its source material primarily in company records and takes its starting point the entrepreneur and the firm...it is the grass roots approach to economic history‚Äù. At Liverpool in 1958, Francis Hyde launched the journal Business History , and a year later, in 1959, Peter Payne was appointed as Colquhoun Lecturer in Business History at the University of Glasgow, under Sydney Checkland. This was the first named lectureship in business history in Britain. This led in 1960 to the establishment of the Business Archives Council (Scotland), to begin surveying and saving from destruction the records of Scottish Business. In the 1960s the post Robbens expansion of the universities, especially of the social sciences, greatly increased academic posts in economic history and economics, and triggered much new research and writing in the history of business, but not then any demand for a separate identity for the subject. A number of important initiatives followed in the 1970s, especially the founding of the annual Business History Seminar, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), and hosted by Derek Oddy. This was first held at Ealing Technical College, and from 1978 at the Polytechnic of Central London (now University of Westminster). The 1978 move to the Polytechnic of Central London coincided with the establishment of the Wadsworth Prize by the Business Archives Council, an annual award for a distinguished publication in business history. From 1980 the Business History Unit launched its Newsletter to reach out to the growing community of researchers and teachers of business history, and to provide a forum for posting news of seminars, conferences, publications, and research initiatives. London was not the sole locus of growing activity in business history. In Scotland, at Glasgow, thirty years of investment in business history culminated in 1987 in the founding and funding of The Centre for Business History in Scotland. Tony Slaven was appointed as Director of the Centre, the post also holding the Chair in Business History. This was a permanently funded research centre, the resources provided by the Aggregate Foundation. It was consequently independent of the need to secure funds by accepting commissioned business histories. Another significant innovation developed from 1988. Geoff Jones, now Isidor Straus Professor of Business History at Harvard Business School, had moved from the Business History Unit to the Department of Economics at Reading. From there he initiated a highly fruitful and intensive series of business history workshop collaborations with the business historians at Lancaster University, who were also within the Department of Economics. These meetings, which resulted in multiple edited books, reflected the institutional locations of the groups with their emphasis on bringing together ‚Äúhistory and theory‚Äù, and involving economists in their deliberations. While these initiatives were proliferating, the main forum for business historians still focused on the small annual seminar at the Polytechnic of London. Attendance was limited and by invitation only, but it did allow for informal exchanges on how to promote the discipline. Particularly involved in such discussions were Geoff Jones, Mary Rose and Tony Slaven, each representing a well established base in business history. The private funding available to Tony Slaven also made it possible for the CBH to lubricate exchanges. All three were in agreement that the key to taking Business History forward was institutionalisation through a new and separate professional organisation with regular conferences, these steps establishing for it an identity that was distinct from the Economic History Society. There was a feeling at the time that the Economic History Society Conference had little to offer those with an interest in Business History, and that if a new association was established it would build beyond the London-based seminars, and pull in a wider audience. The first meeting to establish a British organisation for business history took place on 27 September 1989, in the new premises of the Centre for Business History in Glasgow . The room was packed with business historians from across Britain, and was quite tense. This was partly because the meeting coincided with the editorial shift of Business History away from the BHU to Royal Holloway, Reading and Lancaster which heightened suspicions of empire building by some of the parties involved. By the end of the afternoon it had been agreed to form a pre Committee consisting of Tony Slaven, Geoff Jones, Terry Gourvish, Derek Oddy and Oliver Westall to develop a constitution, plan elections and launch a new Association. The founders were also keen to build an association that would be less formal and more open than the Economic History Society. The drafting of the constitution stressed the need for a small set of active officers with a regular turnover, with all members entitled to vote. The objective of the Association of Business Historians is ‚Äòto promote the study, teaching and publication of all aspects of the history of business and industry, and of the environment in which they operate‚Äô. The first elections were held in September 1990 and the first Council was formed of Derek Oddy (President), Geoff Jones (Vice President), Tony Slaven (Secretary Treasurer), Terry Gourvish (Newsletter Editor), Mary Rose (Membership Secretary) and David Jeremy as Council Member. The two challenges of that first year involved building the membership and launching the first conference. It took place exactly two years after that first meeting on 27‚Äì28 September 1991, at the Centre for Business History in Scotland, in what would become a biennial series of meetings until 2000. The association's Ph.D. prize was introduced in 1997 at the joint British/American conference held in Glasgow and the first winner was Steve Toms. In 2000 the prize became annual and was named the Coleman Prize. Each year the prize winner joins the council to ensure that new researchers become embedded in the networks and practices of the association. The Association of British Historians also had an early influence on the formation of the European Business History Association. Discussions began in 1993 between Geoff Jones, Tony Slaven and Hans Pohl and were soon extended to include Mary Rose, Keetie Sluytermann, Rolv Petter Amdam and Per Boje at a meeting in Glasgow in the autumn of 1993. A series of meetings followed in Bonn, Rotterdam and Reading. The EBHA was formally launched at the business history conference held in Rotterdam in October 1994 with its inaugural conference following in Gothenburg in August 1996.

The spirit manifested itself in February 2004 in the form of a young woman, haunting the Tobelo area for about two months. It was an allegedly unconventional form of Suanggi that was identified with O Tokata, a local malevolent spirit.Hedman, Eva-Lotta E. \\"Conflict, violence, and displacement in Indonesia\\". Old Spirits and new names, SEAP Publications, 2008. p. 278-280 Suanggi appeared as a beautiful woman that enticed young men, particularly teachers. When the man agreed to have sex with her she would attack him and devour his genitals. The presence of the spirit created an atmosphere of fear not only in Tobelo but in other places of North Maluku as well. Village people, particularly the children, were forbidden to go outside their homes in the night. It was claimed that this Suanggi was the vengeful ghost of a Muslim girl seeking retribution against her attackers. The young woman had been the daughter of a Tobelo village leader and she had been raped and brutally murdered by a group of young men during the 1999‚Äì2000 riots in the town. After her death her whereabouts were unknown, but six months later the location of her body lying in a ravine was revealed to a diviner in a dream. When her mortal remains were found in that location, a formal burial ceremony was performed. It was believed that the spirit of this girl had assumed a revengeful form motivated by trauma. Later in 2004, during the first national election in Eastern Indonesia, a local Christian farmer heard the loud wailing cries of a woman near his plantation. He claimed that they came from the bloodthirsty spirit Suanggi \\"as if she was crying into a megaphone\\", similar to the loud speakers widely used in Tobelo during the election campaign. The place where the cries were heard was the precise location where large massacres had taken place during the 1999‚Äì2000 riots between the Christians and the Muslims in which more than 800 people were killed.Hedman, p. 295 Suanggi outside Maluku Suanggi beliefs exist in Maluku's neighboring province of East Nusa Tenggara. In 2010-2011, two houses were destroyed by mobs in Adonara, East Flores Regency, due to the occupants being believed to be suanggi. The East Nusa Tenggara Tourism Office plans to coordinate a race for suanggi to fly as one of the events related to Expo Alor 2019.

In FAM theory, co-ordinate transformation is not involved. It attempts to avoid electromagnetic transients which cause delay in torque control response. First, electromagnetic transients of three-phase induction motor are analyzed. Initial attempt is made to derive \`equivalent circuits valid for both steady state and transient states in induction motor. The key point of FAM control is that the exciting current is kept constant in magnitude and continuous in the equivalent circuit. The speed of rotating air gap flux is made free or adjustable. This means that the magnetic field in the air gap is kept constant in its amplitude and that its speed is adjustable so that a desired value of torque is produced. When the air gap flux is kept constant, other variables like voltages, current and torque are functions of slip frequency only. By accelerating or decelerating rotation of the air gap flux to choose the slip frequency, the torque can be controlled as desired. Electromagnetic transients To obtain very quick torque control response in induction motor, it is required to suppress electromagnetic transients which might be caused by the control. Then it is necessary to investigate the electromagnetic transients of an induction motor. Within the induction motor, the largest inductance is the exciting inductance of exciting reactance. Exciting current flows there. If it is accompanied by any transient, delay time constant will be very large. it is necessary to avoid transients of exciting current. It is therefore necessary to maintain continuity of amplitude and phase of exciting current. Types of control FAM control of induction motor torque has two types of control namely current control and voltage control. Constant exciting current produces good linearity's between torque and slip frequency. In current control, the primary current is the control input to the induction motor whereas the primary terminal voltage is the control input in voltage control. Two transient phenomena are associated with induction motor operation. One is the mechanical transient of the dynamic system driven by induction motor and the other is the electromagnetic transient within the induction motor. In the first, speed and position of the motor shaft are state variables whereas in latter voltage, current, magnetic field are the state variables. Even though the two systems are interconnected but they can be treated separately. In numerical analysis of electromagnetic transients, it is assumed that the related dynamic state variables are constant and the instantaneous value of the motor torque is found and is fed into the analysis of transients in the dynamic system. Performance In FAM control, torque can be controlled by the vector of secondary current.FAM control provides the induction motor with very superior steady state performances based on its T equivalent three circuits which behave same when viewed from primary terminals but differ due to different phenomena occurring in the secondary side.

Today the Clapton Girls' Academy is located here. History Newcome's school was established in the early 18th century. During the 18th century and early 19th century, Hackney was home to schools of all kinds, and was considered a healthy area, close to London. Many prominent Whig families sent their sons to the school, resulting in a large number of Members of Parliament having received their education there. Dr. Henry Newcome, who gave the school its name, was noted for Whig political principles, and the school stayed in the family for three generations, to 1803. The family descended from Henry Newcome, a prominent nonconformist minister in Manchester. His third son Peter was an Anglican priest, and the father of the Henry Newcome who gave the school its name. Distinguished pupils included Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, Prime Minister from 1768 to 1770, and two Founding Fathers of the United States (Middleton and Nelson).

Drama Newcome's School was noted for a series of dramatic productions. In some case a prologue or epilogue was written specially. The school was one of a group that acted as preparatory schools to Westminster School; the dramatic tradition imitated Westminster's, with the difference that plays were in English (rather than Latin). One of the contributors of prologues was David Garrick.John Sargeaunt, Annals of Westminster School (1898), p. 185; archive.org.

The fictitious name may have been used because Mersey was under contract to a record label other than Columbia, which released \\"Tracy's Theme\\", at the time of the recording. It peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960, after being used as the theme for a TV production of The Philadelphia Story. Origin As part of the December 7, 1959 airing on NBC of a new television production of The Philadelphia Story, composer Robert Ascher wrote a melody to be associated with the character of Tracy Lord, played by Diana Lynn on the TV special. Talent Associates, the production company that owned the special, thought the tune had hit potential, so the company worked out a deal with Columbia Records to issue it as a single. This presented a problem for Mersey, the musical director for Talent Associates, as he was under contract with the new Big Top label as its musical director as well; he had already released a single, \\"Bittersweet September,\\" on the label in July 1959. Devon Music, the publishing firm of Talent Associates owned by David Susskind and Howie Richmond at the time, came up with a solution. They created a fictitious artist named \\"Spencer Ross\\", and retained ownership of that pseudonym for potential future use. \\"Tracy's Theme\\" was reviewed in the November 23, 1959 issue of Billboard, two weeks before The Philadelphia Story aired. Another Ascher melody from a Talent Associates production, \\"Thanksgiving Day Parade\\" from the November 27, 1959 airing of Miracle on 34th Street, was used as the B-side. Neither Mersey nor the fictitious Ross were the real stars of the recording; Vincent J. \\"Jimmy\\" Abato, a one-time member of Glenn Miller's orchestra, played the hypnotic melody on the alto saxophone, with the accompaniment of strings and a repeated percussion beat. Reaction A reported 20 million viewers watched the special presentation of The Philadelphia Story. With the single already on the market, and promotional copies in the hands of radio stations, it was only a matter of time before the popular theme started to sell; \\"Tracy's Theme\\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 on January 4, 1960 and reached a peak of #13 on February 22. In the Billboard Top Singles of 1960 ranking at the end of the year, it finished #81. After \\"Tracy's Theme\\" became a hit, Mersey received permission to use the Spencer Ross pseudonym on his next Big Top single, \\"Theme of a Lonely Evening\\" backed with \\"Bobby's Blues\\", but after that, the rights to the Ross name reverted to Devon Music. Two more Spencer Ross singles and a full-length LP, which included \\"Tracy's Theme\\" in addition to non-Mersey productions, were issued on Columbia before the end of 1960. \\"Tracy's Theme\\" would later be covered by instrumentalist Billy Vaughn on his number-one album Theme from \\"A Summer Place\\" (and Other Great Themes).

It was released in 1976 as the lead single from his debut studio album Autorretrato. The song is about a man who tells of his yearnings to a woman who has left. Upon its release, the song was well received in Mexico where it became one of the best-performing songs of the year. Since then, the song has been covered by several artists including Az√∫car Moreno, Ricardo Montaner, David Bustamante and Alejandro Fern√°ndez. Fern√°ndez covered the song on his fifteenth studio album Confidencias (2013) and features American recording artist Christina Aguilera as the guest artist. It was served as the main theme song for the Mexican telenovela La Tempestad. His version peaked at number one on the Mexican Monitor Latino chart and became a top five hit in Spain and on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States. Az√∫car Moreno's cover of the song peaked at number five in Spain while Montaner's version reached number one in Venezuela and ranked at number twenty-three on the US Latin Songs chart. Background Miguel Gallardo started his music career as a songwriter, composing songs for other artists. He started his own career as a singer in 1972 under the alias Eddy Gallardo. His first songs as Eddy Gallardo were \\"Billy Bom\\", \\"Jenny\\", \\"Sentimiento\\", and \\"Explosion de Amor\\" all of which were released as singles. One year later, he changed his stage name to Miguel Gallardo and released several singles including \\"Quedat√©\\" which was inspired by Pablo Neruda's poem Farewell and peaked at number one on the Spanish singles chart. In 1975, Gallardo recorded his first studio album Autorretrato which was released by EMI Records. The song, \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\\", was selected as the lead single from the album. Lyrically, the song speaks about a man who confesses his feelings to a woman who is leaving. It received radio airplay in Mexico and became one of the best-performing songs of 1976 in the country. The song has been adapted into several languages including English, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Bulgarian and Greek. It has been included on several of his greatest albums including 20 Grandes Exitos (1990), Mis Mejores Canciones: 17 Super Exitos (1993), and Mi Vida (2006) which was released shortly after his death. Alejandro Fern√°ndez version \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\\" was covered by Mexican recording artist, Alejandro Fern√°ndez and American recording artist Christina Aguilera for his fifteenth studio album Confidencias (2013). It was released on May 8, 2013, by Universal Music Latino as the lead single from the record. Production of their rendition was handled by Phil Ramone. The track is also featured as the opening theme for the Mexican telenovela La Tempestad. Another version of the song features Fern√°ndez as the solo singer which was included on the deluxe edition of the album. Upon its release, \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\\" received general acclaim from music critics, who placed particular praise on Aguilera's vocal delivery. The track respectively reached numbers one and four in Mexico and Spain. Its accompanying music video, directed by the Simon Brand, was released on July 19, 2013, and was also met with generally favorable reviews. Background and development Fern√°ndez first announced his collaboration with Aguilera in May 2013, during which time he was \\"putting the finishing touches\\" on his then-upcoming studio album Confidencias. Their rendition was produced by Phil Ramone. When discussing the project, Fern√°ndez commented that \\"Christina has an amazing voice, sweet but also very powerful and full of healing\\", and was \\"very happy and proud with the result\\". Their cover version is used as the theme song for the Mexican telenovela La Tempestad. Critical reception Upon its release, \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Tom Jurek of AllMusic called it a \\"smash\\", and listed it as one of three stand-out tracks from Confidencias. A writer for MuuMuse described the cover as a \\"duet for the ages\\" and complimented their vocal performance for being \\"legendary\\". Another contributor to the website opined that Aguilera's performance \\"subsequently rendered all other Spanish language music irrelevant upon its release.\\" Perez Hilton praised the song for emphasizing the \\"power, feeling and all the right touches in all the right places.\\" At the 2014 Billboard Latin Music Awards \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\\" was nominated Hot Latin Song of the Year, Vocal Event, but lost to \\"Loco\\" by Enrique Iglesias and Romeo Santos. Commercial performance \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\\" reached number one on Mexican Singles Chart, organized by Monitor Latino. The track was later certified platinum for reaching sales of 100,000 copies; it accomplished this achievement in seventeen days. It was certified triple platinum for sales of 200,000 copies in December 2013. Also. it proved successful on the Spanish Singles Chart, organized by Productores de M√∫sica de Espa√±a, where it reached number four. In the United States, the track respectively peaked at numbers five and thirteen on the Hot Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts. The song was also certified 3x platinum by the Association of Venezuelan Phonograph Producers (APFV). Music video An accompanying music video for \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\\" was directed by Simon Brand, and was premiered through Vevo on July 19, 2013. Amaris Castilloof of Latina summarized that Fern√°ndez and Aguilera \\"appear to be in an abandoned mansion and overwhelmed with a tremendous desire for each other.\\" She provided a mixed review for the video, questioning if the \\"glimpses of skin touching, scenes of someone swimming (we have no idea who) with luxurious pearls, and a cheesy telenovela-esque embrace\\" were overdone. Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass gave a positive review for the clip, opining that \\"[Aguilera's] stunning curves steal the show and she clearly relishes her role as a steamy seductress.\\" Carolyn Menyes from Mstarz commented that it \\"lives up to the dramatic nature of the song and the telenovela for which it was performed\\", adding that \\"the wistful looks seem straight out of Telemundo.\\" Entropy Studio made the music video postproduction between Los √Ångeles and Zaragoza. The music video was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2014 Lo Nuestro Awards ceremony but lost to \\"Propuesta Indecente\\" by Romeo Santos.

It was released as the second single from the album and a music video for the song was filmed in New York City, New York. The CD single contains the album version and five remixes of the song. Their version peaked at number five on the Spanish Singles Chart. In 2006 Spanish singer and recording artist David Bustamante covered \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\\" on his fourth studio album, called Pentimento, to pay a very special tribute to Miguel Gallardo, author and writer of the song, for his sudden death in November 2005, as Mr Gallardo was Bustamante's first record producer and friend. In 2007, Argentine-Venezuelan recording artist Ricardo Montaner covered the song on his fifteenth studio album Las Mejores Canciones del Mundo, a collection of famous songs covered by him. Released as the lead single from the album, the song peaked at number twenty-three on the Hot Latin Songs and number ten on the Latin Pop Songs charts in the United States. It also peaked at number one in Venezuela on the Record Report Top 100 chart. On the review of Montaner's greatest hits album Un Camino de Exitos (2008), Eric Schneider called \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\\" a \\"dramatic\\" track. The accompanying music video for Montaner's cover was filmed in New York City, New York which was directed by his wife Marlene Rodr√≠guez Miranda and released on August 2007. A dance remix was included on the deluxe version of the album and it was also recorded in bachata music.

It was founded by Russian entrepreneur Dmitry Itskov in February 2011 with the participation of Russian specialists in the field of neural interfaces, robotics, artificial organs and systems. Philippe van Nedervelde serves as the Director of International Development The main goal of the 2045 Initiative, as stated on its website, is \\"to create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual‚Äôs personality to a more advanced non-biological carrier, and extending life, including to the point of immortality. We devote particular attention to enabling the fullest possible dialogue between the world‚Äôs major spiritual traditions, science and society\\". Future prospects The 2045 Initiative has a roadmap for developing cybernetic immortality. The Initiative has the goal for an avatar controlled by a \\"brain-computer\\" interface to be developed between 2015 and 2020, between 2020 and 2025 creating an autonomous life-support system for the human brain linked to a robot, between 2030 and 2035 creating a computer model of the brain and human consciousness with the means to transfer it into an artificial carrier, and by 2045 create a new era for humanity with holographic bodies. Avatar Project One of the featured life-extension projects is to design an artificial humanoid body (called an \\"avatar\\") and an advanced brain‚Äìcomputer interface system. On the biological side, a life support system will be developed for hosting a human brain inside the avatar and maintaining it alive and functional. A later phase of the project will research into the creation of an artificial brain into which the original individual consciousness may be transferred.  Avatar A  A robotic copy of a human body remotely capable of interpreting commands directly from the mind, and sending information back to the mind in a form that can be interpreted via brain‚Äìcomputer interface. It is estimated to be popularized in or before 2020.  Avatar B  An avatar in which a human brain is transplanted at the end of one's life. Avatar B has an autonomous system providing life support for the brain and allowing it interaction with the environment, possibly mounted into an existing Avatar A Chassis. Deadline of this phase is year 2025.  Avatar C  An avatar with an artificial brain to which a human personality is transferred for emulation at the end of one's life. The first successful attempt to upload one's personality to a computer is estimated to happen around 2035.  Avatar D  A hologram- or diagram-like avatar. This is the ultimate goal of this project but is optional since, assuming either the upload is involuntary or all humans chose to upload, biological diseases are prevented in the previous phase, and it is far away from current technological achievement and our understanding on physics. Reception Professor George M. Church has complained that \\"there's a lot of dots that aren't connected in (Itskov's) plans. It's not a real road map.\\" Martine A. Rothblatt, the founder of United Therapeutics, has claimed the Avatar Project is \\"no more wild than in the early '60s, when we saw the advent of liver and kidney transplants.\\" See also * Brain transplant * Cyborg * Exocortex * Human enhancement * Isolated brain * Transhumanism References External links * *Global Future 2045 Congress Category:Biogerontology Category:Immortality Category:Life extension organizations Category:Neurotechnology Category:Non-profit organizations based in Russia Category:Transhumanist organizations Category:2045 in science ","title":"2045 Initiative"},{"id":"39374440","text":"The Court at 497-503¬Ω North Madison Avenue is a bungalow court located at 497-503¬Ω N.

Meadors has served as dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Oklahoma and of the College of Health, Social and Public Services at Eastern Washington University, chief executive officer at Penn State Altoona, chancellor at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke and president of the University of Central Arkansas (UCA). In September 2011, Meadors resigned from UCA and subsequently served as executive director of the United Arab Emirates Higher Education Coordination Council and president of St. John International University. Early life and education Allen Meadors was born in Van Buren, Arkansas and attended Van Buren Senior High School, from which he graduated in 1965. He enrolled at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville before transferring to the University of Central Arkansas, from where he graduated with a Bachelor in Business Administration in 1969. After graduating, he returned to the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville to study for an MBA, but again left after one semester to join the United States Air Force. Meadors subsequently obtained a master's in business administration from the University of Northern Colorado and a master's in public administration from the University of Kansas. He also holds master's degrees in psychology and human relations and in health services management from Webster University. Meadors was awarded his PhD in administration and education by Southern Illinois University in 1981. He also has an associate degree in computer science from Saddleback College, and certificates in health services administration from Trinity University and in health systems management from MIT. Academic career Meadors was discharged from the US Air Force in September 1973. He subsequently started work for Blue Cross Blue Shield in Topeka, Kansas. In 1976, he was appointed assistant director for public health in Kansas City. He subsequently worked as a health consultant, and as an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University, administering degree programmes on military installations. In 1982, he became associate professor and director of the Division of Health Administration at the University of Texas. Meadors served as the executive director of the Northwest Arkansas Radiation Therapy Institute between 1984 and 1987. In 1987, Meadors was appointed as a professor and chair of the Department of Health Administration at the University of Oklahoma. Between 1989 and 1990, he was dean of the College of Public Health at Oklahoma. Meadors subsequently worked as dean of the College of Health, Social and Public Services at Eastern Washington University between 1990 and 1994, after which he served as chief executive at Penn State Altoona from 1994 to 1999. He moved to North Carolina to become the new chancellor at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP) in 1999. The university saw an increase from 214 staff and 2,966 students in 1999 to 424 staff and 6,727 students by 2009. In January 2009, in response to criticism that UNCP (which was founded with a mission to train Native American school teachers) was not doing enough to recruit Native American students, Meadors addressed the Lumbee Tribal Council, outlining a number of initiatives targeting Native American recruits. He reported that the number of Native American students at UNCP had risen from 686 in 1999 to 941 in 2009. In February 2009, Meadors was appointed president of the University of Central Arkansas. Between 2012 and 2014, Meadors was executive director of the United Arab Emirates Higher Education Coordination Council. He has also served as the president of St. John International University. He was a senior consultant with the Global Leadership Group. He is an advisory board member for Edu Alliance and was a search consultant with Academic Keys Executive Search before moving on to work as a consultant with Academic Career and Executive Search. Meadors has served on the board of trustees of the Southeastern Regional Medical Center, a hospital in Lumberton, North Carolina. Controversy In September 2011, it was reported that the University of Central Arkansas (UCA) board had bought out Meadors's contract, accepted his resignation in return, and replaced him with an interim president, Tom Courtway. The board's actions followed a controversy about renovations and expansion of the university president's house. The university campus food service contractor Aramark had offered to contribute $700,000 to the cost of the renovation. Meadors and board chair Scott Roussel reportedly did not inform the board that the deal involved granting Aramark a new service contract. In January 2013, while working in the United Arab Emirates, Meadors pleaded guilty to violating the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act during his time as the UCA president, after he was \\"accused of urging a vice president to destroy a letter that said the offer would be in exchange for renewing Aramark's contract\\". Meadors had originally been charged with tampering with a public document, but reached a negotiated plea bargain for the Arkansas FOIA violation. Roussel also resigned in May 2012, but was not charged with any offense. Honors and awards Meadors has received awards including an outstanding professional service award from the University of Texas and the Ben Lane Award for outstanding contributions to student affairs at Penn State. He was a senior fellow of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities in 2011‚Äì12. UNCP has established endowed chairs, the Allen C. Meadors Distinguished Professorship in Mathematics and the Allen C. Meadors Endowed Chair in Computer Science, in his honor. Personal life Meadors and his wife Barbara have two sons.

Whisky tastings are often conducted in groups of people, either for reference purposes or as a social activity. Tasting glasses Glass selection is important when tasting whisky seriously. The least appropriate is the traditional tumbler due to its large mouth, allowing the dissipation of the fumes and the grip which encourages unwanted warming of the liquid. The generally accepted industry standard for whisky tasting glasses is tulip-shaped with a stem, such as a sherry glass or copita. Another popular glass is the Glencairn whisky glass. Other specifically manufactured tasting glasses include a lid to retain the aromas. Tasting methodologies Although there need not be any formal structure to a whisky tasting, more often than not the process will be broken down into the following stages. Tasting notes Throughout the tasting process notes may be taken for future reference, or for publication. These will often be separated into notes on the nose, palate and finish. Tasting notes might be literal, such as \\"a hint of TCP\\". They may also be more emotive. For example, someone might suggest that the nose of a whisky reminds them of their grandfather's old study, invoking musty books, leather and possibly tobacco aromas. No two noses are the same, however: one may be more sensitive to a particular aroma than another and sometimes a nose might be unable to detect a certain smell at all. This phenomenon, known as nose-blindness, is why tasting notes are best compiled by a panel of three or more. Visual analysis The whisky glass is held at a 45 degree angle, often against a white background, to give a clear view through the spirit. The depth of colour is largely determined by the cask the whisky has been conditioned in: Spanish and European oak tends to impart far more colour than American White oak, for example. A light colour might also indicate a cask which has been re-used several times. A golden colour could be the result of an ex-Bourbon cask while a sherry cask will give the whisky a copper colour. But the colour may also give clues as to the age of the whisky, the maturation that the spirit has had and whether or not any artificial colours have been added. In the latter case, however, the aroma of caramel, often used to colour the whisky, is likely to be detectable. After an initial nosing the whisky is swirled, so that it rises up the edges of the glass, and allowed to settle. The spirit will leave legs on the side of the glass. The thickness of the legs and the length of time they persist will give clues as to the strength of the spirit and the level of cask interaction. Note how cask interaction is of importance as opposed to maturity as the legs will be influenced by how active the cask is.https://www.whiskybosh.com/whisky- handbook/2019/9/30/how-to-taste-whisky / How to Taste Whisky publisher Whiskybosh The Whisky Handbook Retrieved 3 October 2019 During the repeated process, after water has been added, a hazy appearance will indicate that Chill filtering has not taken place. Nose The spirit is sniffed so that the aroma (nose) can be examined. The nose should be above the rim to start then gradually deeper into the glass to catch the full aroma. Depending on the strength of the spirit being analysed, it is advisable not to put the nose too far into the glass and inhale too deeply at first, in case of burning from the fumes. This is particularly true of cask strength spirits, 60% ABV. Standard strength, 40% ABV, are unlikely to affect the nose in this way. Once comfortable with the strength of the spirit, it's typical to take deep sniffs of the spirit with the mouth open, which has the effect of opening up the palate and making it easier to detect aromas. The glass is then swirled whilst warming the whisky with the hand and the nosing process repeated. Palate The whisky is tasted, often a little at first, and then in larger amounts and with the spirit being moved around the tongue and swallowed slowly. The purpose of the first tasting is to appraise the texture while subsequent tastings are to analyse flavours and scents. In the second tasting the primary flavours are determined. There are only five of these, detected by the tongue: salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami (savoury); the other 'flavours' are aromas and are picked up at the back of the nasal passage. Finish The flavour of the whisky will linger on the palate and will change over time as the flavour decays in the mouth. Water Optionally, the entire process will be repeated with a small amount of water, which changes the flavour profile of the spirit. This is because the water breaks apart the fatty esters in the whisky, releasing the flavour locked within. The water should be at room temperature. The next best thing is a soft spring water. Tap water is adequate but it should be left to stand for several hours to allow the chlorine to disperse. Chilled water or ice is not advisable for whisky tasting as it closes off the flavour. Water should be added a few drops at a time to avoid 'drowning' the whisky. Generally speaking though, whisky imparts most flavour when diluted to 20-30% ABV.

This species has been used to demonstrate that cross-fertilization produces a higher infective success rate than self-fertilization. S. solidus is parasitic, and dependent on its host's habitat in order to infect and manipulate the behavior of the copepods, three-spined sticklebacks, and piscivorous birds. As cestodes that infect the intestinal tract of their hosts, S. solidus shares the diet of the organism where it resides. S. solidus is known to metabolize glycogen within its host Life Cycle The life cycle of S. solidus involves hatching from eggs in freshwater through bird's feces, at approximately fourteen days many eggs have well-defined coracidia . The free-swimming coracidium is usually spherical, moving fairly rapidly and smoothly. The first larval stage begins, the coracidium is produced. The coracidium is then ingested by the first intermediate host cyclopoid copepod, Macrocyclops albidus. Within one to two weeks, the infected copepod is ingested by the second intermediate host, the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. The third larval stage, the plerocercoid, grows in the abdomen of the fish. When the fish is eaten by a piscivorous bird, the larvae matures, and adults inside the piscivorous birds will reproduce sexually (outcross or selfing) in this final host, followed by fecal excretion of eggs into water. Behavioral Manipulation In a natural environment, infection intensity seems to be controlled by a crowding effect; no more than four Schistocephalus solidus plerocercoids have been found in a single host. However, the prevalence of infection can be highly variable. S. solidus manipulates the behavior of its fish host, making it more vulnerable to predation to piscivorous birds. This makes the parasite more likely to reach its next host.

North Korea is naturally abundant in metals such as magnesite, zinc, tungsten, and iron; with magnesite resources of 6 billion tonnes (second largest in the world), particularly in the Hamgyeong-do and Jagang-do provinces. However, often these cannot be mined due to the acute shortage of electricity in the country, as well as the lack of proper tools to mine these materials and an antiquated industrial base. Coal, iron ore, limestone, and magnesite deposits are larger than other mineral commodities. Mining joint ventures with other countries include China, Canada, Egypt, and South Korea. Resource base North Korea has reserves of more than 200 mineral types distributed over 80% of its territory with ten reserves recording large deposits of magnetite, tungsten ore, graphite, gold ore, and molybdenum. Among the largest resources with more than 2 million tons of estimated reserve are: Zinc which tops the list with 21 million tons of estimated resource; followed by non-metallic resource of 21 million tons of limestone and magnesite 6 million tons; and other mineral sources such as iron 5 million tons, anthracite 5 million tons, copper 3 million tons, barite 2 million tons, gold and graphite also 2 million tons each. The Mineral Industry in the country is structured under three broad sectors namely, coal mining, ferrous and nonferrous metals mining, and processing sector and industrial minerals mining and processing sector. All these sectors are owned by the central government and it is also reported that the mineral industry supports the country‚Äôs military budget. Metal mining North Korea is thought to have tremendous potential metal resources (and particularly rare-earth metals), which have been valued in excess of US$6 trillion by the South Korean national mining company. There is much investment from Chinese mining companies, with an estimated $500 million investment in the last 11 years. 41% of all Chinese companies trading in North Korea are involved in mining. Zinc mining The Korea General Zinc Industry Group is a North Korean mining and industrial group headquartered in Pyongyang. The organization produces zinc, lead, base bullion, lead concentrates, zinc concentrates, cadmium, arsenic, zinc residues and copper concentrate for export and domestic use. The Geomdeok Mine, located in Geumgol-dong, Dancheon- si, Hamgyeongnam-do, has been in operation since 1932 and is the largest zinc mine in East Asia. It has seven mine blocks extracted through 10 mines. It has annual capacity to handle 10 million tons of zinc ore. Conventional flotation methods are adopted to extract lead and zinc concentrates. Other products from the mine are sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and galena. Gold mining In gold alone the nation is estimated to hold around 2,000 metric tonnes of reserves, which at a gold value of $1,200/ounce, would give a total worth of $84.6 billion. The Daebong Mine, located on the border of Gapsan and Woonheung in Yanggang Province, produced more than 150 kilograms (kg) (4,823 troy ounces) of gold annually. Further improvements are proposed in this mine with Chinese investment under a package of offer of mineral rights in exchange for capital investment in the mine. The Sangnong Mine, in the Dancheon district of Hamgyeongnam-do has been in operation since 1956 and is an underground mine. The mine also extracts pyrite, chalcopyrite, magnesite, native gold, and native silver. In 2008, the annual production was reported as 290,000 tons of concentrate at a grade of 30g/t. To process the low-grade concentrate of the Sangnong Mine, the Dongdae Custom Mill Plant (located in Dancheon city) has been established. This plant has processed twenty million tons of tailings and the waste piled up in the yard of the plant has still a gold pf grade of 1.44g/t. The Holdong Mine in the Holdong labor district in Yeonsan-gun, Hwanghaebuk-doce has been in operation since 1893. Gold and other ores are found in a strike of strip. The plant has capacity for annual handling of 2 tonnes of gold, 2.5 tonnes of silver, and 80,000 tonnes of copper concentrate. In 1991, the mine recorded a production of 0.85 tonnes of gold, 1.674 tonnes of silver, and 893 tonnes of copper concentrate. Copper mining The DPRK is estimated to hold a total amount of 2.1 million metric tonnes of copper metal. The Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) was involved in a joint-development project with a Chinese firm in the development of a copper mine in Hyesan. However, KOMID was blacklisted by the United Nations in 2009 subsequent to North Korea's April 5 rocket launch. This resulted in a halting of facility construction at Hyesan. The Hyesan copper mine, located Yanggang Province would be operated by the Hyesan-China Joint Venture Mineral Co. The Hyesan Mine, located in Masan-dong, Hyesan-si, and Ryanggang-do, has been in operation since 1970 and is the largest copper mine in the country. It was flooded and hence closed from 1994 to 2009 and has been partially reopened, after bailing out water, since 2010. Other products from the mine are chalcocite, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite. The plant has a capacity to handle 1,200,000 tons of copper ore annually. According to a 1993 report, the mine produced about 90,000 tons of concentrate of 16% grade of copper. Iron ore mining Musan Mine, located at Musan-gun, in the Changryeol labor districts and Hamgyeongbuk-do, is being operated by Mitsubishi Mining Company of Japan since 1935. The ore is found a strike stip of 1200 m and is operated through nine blocks and extraction is by open pit method. Its iron ore handling capacity is 10 million tons per year. The annual production is reported to be 2 million tons of iron concentrate of 65% grade. After processing at the Gimchaek Steel Mill, iron is exported to China. The Oryong Mine, located in Ryongcheon-ri, Hyeryeong City, in Hamgyeongbuk-do, has been in operation since 2007. Iron ore is embedded in granite formations as magnetite, hematite, and ilmenite in the Musan group and Liwon-am group of rocks, and the ore extracted in directly transported to China without milling. The ore exported in 2007 was of the order of 3,000 tons. Nonferrous metal mining In 2005, it was reported that Kimduk Combined Mining Enterprise was the country's largest nonferrous metal mine. Graphite mining Jeongchon Mine is a graphite mine located in Jeongchon-gun, Hamgyeongnam-do and the ore is found in a vein 700 meters long. Mining operation was started here in 2006. It is an inter-Korean project with South Korea getting a share of 50% of the extracted graphite. Magnesite mines Magnesite in the Tanchon area, a very large resource, has been under extraction since 1980 from the Taehung Youth Hero Mine and the Yongyang Mine, and the former mine is reported to be operating to its full capacity. Daeheung Mine, located in Daeheung-dong, Dancheon-si, and Hamgyeongnamdo comprising four mine blocks has been in operation since 1982. It is reported to be the largest magnesite mine in the world. Magnesite ore is found in a strike of 1600 m and has been extracted since 1982. Both open pit and underground mining are done in these mine blocks and there is a total capacity to extract magnesite ore of 600,000 tons per year. In 2006 the production reported was 230,000 tons of magnesite of grade of up to 46.5 percent of MgO. Coal mining In addition to its metal resources, North Korea is also abundant in coal and limestone (with 100 billion metric tonnes), valued at some US$9.7 trillion. In particular the purest form of coal, anthracite, is especially abundant, with reserves of over 4.5 billion tonnes, which at $143/tonne would be worth $644.8 billion. Jikdong coal mine is an anthracite coal mine located in Jikdong, Suncheon-si, Pyongannam-do where an underground mining operation started in 1997. It has capacity to handle 1 million tons of coal per year. The coal is transported by trucks directly to run the Dongpyeongyang Thermal power plant. Gogeonwon Mine is also an anthracite coal mine located in the Gogeonwon labor district, Kyeongwongun, Hamgyeongbuk-do and has been in operation as an underground mine since 1920. It has a capacity of 1 million tons per year and the coal mined is sent by trucks to run the Cheongjin Thermal Power Plant and the Seongjin Steel Company. In 2013, North Korea surpassed Vietnam to become the global top exporter of anthracite, generating $1.4 billion in revenue for the DPRK (10% of the country's GDP). Another estimate puts the nation's 2015 coal exports at 19.7 million tonnes, worth $1.1 billion.China suspends North Korean coal imports for three weeks in line with UN sanctions, SCMP, 11 December 2016 The regime relies on these profits to procure much of what it needs the most.

It is endemic to New Zealand. Its larvae feed off Olearia species and the adult moth can be seen on the wing from November to April. This species is regarded as rare.  Taxonomy  This species was first described in 1913 by Edward Meyrick and named Chloroclystis cotinaea. Meyrick collected the type specimen in March 1883 in Masterton. This specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. George Hudson discussed this species in 1928 in his book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand stating that no other examples of this moth had yet been found. In 1931 Meyrick, thinking he was describing a new species, again described and naming it Chloroclystis tornospila. Meyrick used a specimen collected by George Hudson in the Tongariro National Park which is also held at the Natural History Museum, London. In 1939 Hudson illustrated this moth in A Supplement to the Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. Hudson also illustrated what he believed to be the female of the species in 1950. In 1971 John S. Dugdale placed C. cotinaea within the genus Pasiphila. C. tornospila was synonymised with P. cotinaea in 1988 by Dugdale.  Description  Pasiphila cotinaea by George Hudson Meyrick described this species as follows: The larvae of this species are green, red and white lined.  Distribution  P. cotinaea is endemic to New Zealand. It is known from the middle of the North Island down as far south as Southland and is abundant in the eastern part of the South Island. However they have not been found in eastern Otago. This species is regarded as being rare.  Life cycle and behaviour  Adults are on wing from November to April and are most common in April. There may be two generations per year. Hudson mentions that he collected a specimen that was attracted to light.  Host species and habitat  Olearia odorata The preferred habitat of this lowland species are forested valleys and associated shrublands. The larvae feed on the flowers of various small-leaved Olearia species including O. odorata, O. bullata, O. laxiflora, O. fimbriata, O. hectorii and O. virgata.

He spent the next five years in France, during which time he enrolled at the University of Paris VII, earning a doctorate in sociology in 1985. In 1987 Gao joined the Communist Party of China. From 1989 to 1990 he was the chief of the financial department of CNMEIEC, and was from 1992 to 1994 the deputy general manager of China National Resources Corporation. Government In 1994 Gao was appointed head of the Planning and Finance Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), a predecessor of the Ministry of Commerce, and promoted to assistant minister in 1997, a job he held for the next five years. In 2002 Gao was transferred from the central government to Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, where he served as Vice Chairman (governor). Only a year later, he returned to the reorganized MOFTEC, now called Ministry of Commerce, as Vice Minister. He stayed in the position for 10 years, and concurrently served as China's International Trade Negotiation Representative from 2010 to 2013. At the 12th National People's Congress of March 2013, Gao was appointed Minister of Commerce in the cabinet of Premier Li Keqiang, replacing the outgoing minister Chen Deming. Gao left his post as Minister of Commerce in 2017. Gao was a full member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.  J.P Morgan controversy  In 2015, the Wall Street Journal released an article which examined Gao Hucheng's interaction with J.P. Morgan in regards to employment of his son, Gao Jue (also known as Joe Gao). In a December 2006 email exchange, a recruiter at the bank says \\"I am more concerned that Jue did very poorly in interviews - some MDs said he was the worst BA candidate they had ever see - and we obviously had to extend him an offer.\\" In June of 2008, Gao Hucheng had dinner with Fang Fang, a managing director at the bank, and requested that Fang find a new position for Gao Jue, as Gao Jue's job had been cut. According to Fang in an email, \\"During this one-on-one dinner with me, the father spent long time explaining to me why it is important for the son to find another position with JPM before July 13 because he is desperate to maintain his hard-won H1-B visa which is under JPM sponsorship and won't become valid until Oct 1, while his current employment contract will end by July 13. [...] The father indicated to me repeatedly that he is willing to go extra miles to help JPM in whatever way we think he can.\\" Gao Jue was given a new position within the bank after the dinner, and shortly afterwards, he sent a sexually explicit email to a human resources employee at the bank. His manager in his new role, Anil Bhalla, said \\"there is general consensus among the seniors in our group as well reports from people in his previous group that he is immature, irresponsible and unreliable.\\"  References  Category:Ministers of Commerce of the People's Republic of China Category:Political office-holders in Guangxi Category:Beijing International Studies University people Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:Politicians from Shuozhou Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Shanxi Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Shanxi ","title":"Gao Hucheng"},{"id":"39374712","text":"Gartz Court is a bungalow court located at 745 N.

Engine  The Vespa T5 was a true sporting scooter featuring: * a 5 port aluminum cylinder design with Nikasil plating * a squarish (55 x 52 mm) and lightweight piston design * a lightened flywheel * a shorter 24mm carburetor (Dell'orto 24/24 G) The T5 exceeded a top speed of per hour, as standard, and compared favorably to the Vespa PX200; but its dependence on higher revs and relative lack of torque made it pale in adverse conditions, and/or with a pillion.Vespa PX In the UK, and some entry-level Spanish and Italian models, premixing of 2 stroke oil was required; on French and German (and as an option in others) markets, autolube was standard, and accompanied by an electric start setup not available on base models. The Vespa T5 had CDI ignition. Depending on the market, it either had no battery and all electrical components were powered by magneto after starting the engine. (UK, base models in Spain and Italy), or if a battery was fitted, it had an electric starter, and fuel gauge, as well as horn, were powered directly by DC (battery).  Body  Like classic Vespas, the scooter had full steel body panels and weighed around dry. The engine was housed in the rear right side on a swing-arm and the left side housed a spare wheel. The rear brake was operated by a right foot pedal. The T5 was sold in three generations: # Vespa T5 Mk1 (1985-1992): Cosmetically, the Vespa T5 Mk1 featured a rectangular headlight, an updated headset console which included a fuel level indicator and a digital or analog tachometer (depending on market), a flat rear end (achieved by adding the \\"square tail\\" sheet to a PX body), and a redesigned seat to complete the look. The front mudguard was smaller compared to the P-series mudguard and the steering head was attached to the fork via a locking ring instead of a handlebar-bolt. The scooter had a classic 4-speed manual left-hand twist grip gear change, a kick starter, and a front storage compartment with a black tray atop it, adorned with a \\"Pole Position\\", logo, designed to underline its sportiness. # Vespa T5 Classic (1992-1999): The T5 Classic had a standard Vespa PX frame but kept the T5 engine. # Vespa T5 Millennium (1999): In 1999 Piaggio ended production of the T5. A numbered limited edition of T5 Millennium scooters would mark the end to the T5. The T5 Millennium saw the addition of a front disk brake.  Similar Scooters utilising the T5 Mk1 body  * Piaggio GS200: In Germany, the Benelux, and Japan, Piaggio offered a similarly bodied version with a standard PX200 engine: the GS200. *Motovespa PX125 T5 Sport: The Spanish T5 had the 5 port engine, a VIN starting with 98, and a plastic framed seat with a different seat pin. * MotoVespa TX200: In Spain, MotoVespa offered a similarly bodied version with a standard PX200 engine: the TX. * Piaggio&LML; T5: The Indian LML Vespa T5 had a standard PX100, PX150 or PX200 engine.

The dam's main purpose is water supply. The impounded reservoir is also called Yellow Pinch Dam. Location and features Completed in 1987, the Yellow Pinch Dam is a major dam that, while situated across the Yellow Pinch Creek, receives its main inflow from the Tantawanglo Creek via the Tantawanglo Creek Weir, located from the dam wall. The dam's secondary inflow is received from the Bega River via the Bega to Yellow Pinch Dam pipeline. The dam was built by the NSW Department of Public Works on behalf of the Bega Valley Shire Council to supply water to Merimbula, Tura Beach, Pambula Beach, Pambula and rural properties. The Yellow Pinch Dam, together with Ben Boyd Dam and Tilba Dam, also both off-stream, are used for storing water for town water supply, with water pumped, or piped by gravity, from a source water intake. The dams have small catchment areas and rainfall in the dam catchment areas contributes only a minor proportion of the volume of water collected and stored. The dam wall constructed with of rockfill with an internal earth core is high and long. At 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water.

Bega to Yellow Pinch Dam Water Transfer Pipeline The 10 million federally-funded Bega to Yellow Pinch Dam Water Transfer Pipeline and pumping stations provides an additional source of water to secure water supplies for the Bega Valley Shire. The project commenced in 2007 and involved the construction of a high lift pump station, capable of pumping up to per day from the lower Bega River and Bega borefields. This water is carried through a pipeline to Yellow Pinch Dam. The benefits of the project include the protection of low environmental flows at Tantawanglo Creek by extracting and storing larger volumes of water during high Bega River flows; the increased security of supply to townships in the south of the Bega Valley Shire through the use of water from the lower Bega River; and providesfor greater flexibility and availability of water for landholder extraction in the upper catchment.

The series is broadcast on the internet and premiered on March 20, 2013. For Season One, five episodes have been created and for Season Two, seven episodes. The show can be found distributed across the web on Stage17.tv. Wallflowers is about four friends in New York who belong to a support group who can't get dates. The core group of characters are in their mid-late 30s and are from the last generation of people who did not have the internet to date people. The characters find themselves single and are not very successful with getting dates.  Characters  Regulars: Bryce Hunter (Patch Darragh)- A former child star turned casting director. Openly gay, Bryce is acerbic, closed off and wary of trusting people. He drinks and smokes to excess. Daisy Loeb (Sarah Saltzberg)- Bryce's best friend and partner at Hunter Casting. She works hard to balance her romantic tendencies with her no- nonsense outlook on life. Martin Parrish (Gibson Frazier)- Nearing 40, Martin is looking for the right woman to settle down with, marry and start a family. Unfortunately, his eagerness to do so rarely gets him a second date. Janice Ackerman (Christianne Tisdale)- A former back-up singer for a lot of bands you don't remember, Janice now dispenses relationship advice at a weekly meeting in NYC. But her help doesn't stop there. She gives her all to her followers. Whether they like it or not. Jane Tavana (Jolly Abraham)- The prodigal group member, now returned after being fired from her job as a high powered attorney and ending an affair with her married boss. Jane refuses to be caught in anything she can't get out of, to the point of self-sabotage. Rhonda (Susan Louise O'Connor)- Optimistic, romantic, loving, a doormat. Rhonda is out there plugging away, refusing to see the negative in anything. Linus (Max Crumm)- Linus is the newest member of the group. A bartender and aspiring comic book artist, he's terribly inept at dating and has no clue just how attractive he is. Victoria Pond (Angela Lin)- Angry, defensive and devastatingly hilarious, Victoria was raised in a culture where women were seen to be subservient, and has fought against that her entire life. She surrounds herself with gay men and makes it very difficult to let anyone else in, for fear of losing her identity. (Season One only) Recurring: Leslie (Marcia DeBonis)- Office manager at Hunter Casting. The real muscle behind the team. Becca (Jillian Louis)- Casting assistant and rival of Daisy's for pretty much everything. Wade (Daniel Abeles)- New receptionist at Hunter Casting.

(Season One only) Mark (Wayne Wilcox)- Filmmaker and client of Hunter Casting. He and Daisy have an infatuation with one another. Though Mark is a large presence in Season 2, he is never seen other than from a hazy profile on a computer screen or heard as a voice over the phone. This was due to actor Wayne Wilcox's unavailability during shooting. Actor Mark Provencher stepped in to do the brief bits in Season 2. Notable Guests: Troy (Charlie Williams) - Aspiring actor, boyfriend of Todd, worst casting reader on the face of the earth. (Season One) Nancy (Lisa Joyce, featured in 2014 film A Master Builder) - Martin's pregnant co-worker, with whom he strikes up a friendship after volunteering to accompany her lamaze classes. (Season Two) Greg (Bryce Pinkham) - Nancy's husband, a stand-up comedian on the road. (Season Two) Dan Randall (Richard Gallagher) - A filmmaker who offers Bryce a shot at a comeback. (Season 2 and beyond)  History  Wallflowers was created and written by a director producer Kieran Turner who grew up in South Florida, Hollywood. Kieran began his career in entertainment at the age of six as a child actor appearing in television commercials, episodic television and feature films. Retiring from acting at age 17, Kieran went on to attend NYU receiving both a BFA and MFA in filmmaking from the Tisch School of the Arts, where he wrote and directed his first feature film, \\"24 Nights,\\" which was released in 2001 by TLA Releasing. In 2012, Turner's 2nd feature, Jobriath A.D., hit the film festival circuit, playing worldwide at over 50 venues before being acquired by distributor Factory 25, who released the film theatrically in early 2014. Season One of Wallflowers was financed by Turner himself and released in April 2013 on Blip TV and YouTube. The show was subsequently picked up for a fully funded 2nd season by a brand new online digital platform, Stage17, which specializes in programming by the Broadway community (many of the cast of Wallflowers are working Broadway/theater actors). Season Two launched on April 3, 2014, three days after the launch of Stage17 itself. Turner lives in Los Angeles, but shoots the show in NYC in part, to take advantage of the pool of theatrical acting talent therein. Several cast changes have been implemented during the show's brief run. The character of Bryce Hunter has been recast twice. Originally played by Tony nominee Chad Kimball, who was unable to continue with the series past Episode 3 of Season 1, the role was recast with actor Lucas Near-Verbrugghe. To introduce the switch, the show filmed a short piece which was a parody of the Steven Carrington/Dynasty actor swap, with the cast of Wallflowers gathered in a hospital room, awaiting Bryce's head bandages to be removed. Near-Verbrugghe relocated to Los Angeles at the end of Season 1, so the role was once again recast, this time with actor Patch Darragh, who filmed all of Season 2 and is the current Bryce Hunter. Darragh's reception by viewers has been overwhelmingly positive, with many saying he is the definitive Bryce Hunter. In between seasons, the cast shot a series of \\"minisodes\\" in order to keep up viewer interest. There were seven \\"video dating\\" segments, each featuring a different cast member, and five installments of a new segment called \\"Ask Janice,\\" an advice vlog by the show's resident relationship guru, Janice Ackerman. In an interview Turner stated where the inspiration came from for the series, \\"I became very excited by some of the newer web series I was seeing that were longer in format, were well-written, acted and directed and felt like actual TV shows. And any time I can find a forum to portray the kinds of characters I want to see that aren‚Äôt getting done elsewhere, I jump at it.\\"  Season 1  Episode 1: Square Pegs - Pilot.

Its issue coincided with the publication of a new album with Louis Gordon \\"The Pleasures of Electricity\\" and the re-issue of Foxx's first four solo albums on CD, Metamatic, The Garden, The Golden Section and In Mysterious Ways, all published by Edsel Records. Unlike the previous compilation, Assembly, \\"Modern Art\\" is a chronological and fairly straightforward compendium of Foxx's 1980s singles (with the exception of \\"20th Century\\" which was a B side) plus a selection of tracks covering musical output since returning to the music scene in 2007. Although the content of the album features output from all of Foxx's musical output to date, including the Cathedral Oceans ambient project, the cover art uses photographs of Foxx from his relatively short Metamatic era. Track listing # Underpass # No-One Driving # Burning Car # 20th Century # Miles Away # Europe After The Rain # Dancing Like A Gun # Endlessly # Your Dress # Like A Miracle # Stars On Fire # Enter The Angel # Sunset Rising # The Noise # Nightlife # Shifting City # My Face # He's A Liquid Tracks 1-12: all single edits or remixes. This version of \\"Endlessly\\" is the original 1982 single version, not the 1983 version featured on the previous Assembly compilation. \\"Nightlife\\" is stated as being from The Pleasures of Electricity, even though said album had yet to be published. This version of \\"Shifting City\\" is the live in the studio version as appears on the \\"Subterranean Omnidelic Exotour\\" album. The final two tracks are previously unavailable 'bonus' tracks, namely My Face, issued in 1980 as a flexi-disc only with Smash Hits magazine, and an alternative version of the Metamatic track \\"He's A Liquid\\", quoted as being the B side to Underpass promo-only 12\\" single.

He played as a centre half or left half. Life and career Ormiston was born in Peebles, Scotland. He played non- league football in England for Hebburn Argyle, before joining Football League Second Division club Lincoln City in 1907. The club finished bottom of the division in 1908, and failed to gain re-election to the League. Ormiston helped Lincoln win their second Midland League title in 1908‚Äì09, and then followed former Lincoln manager David Calderhead to First Division club Chelsea. He played just over 100 matches in senior competition over five years, and made a solid contribution to Chelsea's return to the First Division in 1912, but his career with the club effectively ended in April 1914 when he suffered a serious ankle injury in a match at Bradford City. He guested for former club Lincoln during the war, and signed for them when competitive football resumed in 1919. On the opening day of the 1919‚Äì20 season, as Lincoln earned an unexpected draw against West Ham United, who were playing their first match after joining the Football League from the Southern League, Ormiston's experience made him stand out: He played his last game for Lincoln in December 1919, and returned to Scotland, where he appeared for Peebles Rovers. Ormiston died 30 Jun 1952 in Peebles, Peeblesshire, Scotland.
