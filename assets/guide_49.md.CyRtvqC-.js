Early life and family Brina Kessel was born November 20, 1925, in Ithaca, New York, to Quinta Cattell and Marcel Hartwig Kessel, one of five children. Both of her parents encouraged her interest in birds and natural history at an early age. She counted among her grandparents James McKeen Cattell, an influential psychologist and academic. She was raised in Storrs, Connecticut, and attended elementary and high school there. Kessel was graduated from Cornell University in 1947 with a Bachelor of Science degree. She then went to the University of Wisconsin to study with Aldo Leopold. Unfortunately, Leopold died fighting a fire on his property in 1948. She also learned that the university did not accept women into its doctoral program in wildlife management. She received a master's degree from Wisconsin in 1949 and returned to Cornell to resume her studies with Arthur Augustus Allen. Kessel collected some of the first recordings of bird vocalization at Cornell. With her dissertation on the European starling, she received her PhD in 1951. Brina Kessel married Raymond Roof. Roof was on the faculty of the University of Alaska. At the time of his death, May 9, 1968, he was a design engineer at the University's Geophysical Institute. Career Brina Kessel joined the faculty of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) as an instructor in zoology in the summer of 1951. (At that time, Fairbanks was the only campus for the university.) She advanced quickly to professorship. She served as head of the Department of Biological Sciences from 1957 through 1966 and as dean of the College of Biological Sciences and Renewable Resources from 1961 to 1972. For the University of Alaska Museum, she was curator of terrestrial vertebrates from 1972 to 1990 and curator of ornithology from 1990 until her retirement in 1997. Brina Kessel conducted research on many aspects of Alaska's bird life over a span of more than 55 years. A particular interest was birds of the taiga and tundra. Her early research in the 1950s explored the lands of Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 4 on Alaska's North Slope; however, in those days the Department of Defense did not permit women to conduct fieldwork on the property. Thus, Tom Cade and George Schaller worked in the field, while Kessel wrote up results as principal investigator. A few years later, Kessel worked in the Brooks Range with Margaret Murie and her husband Olaus Murie. Kessel worked in the field for many years studying the avifauna of the Seward Peninsula. Kessel's research culminated in publications that include Birds of the Seward Peninsula, Alaska (1989) and Habitat Characteristics of Some Passerine Birds in Western North American Taiga (1998). Kessel brought her scientific expertise to several projects in the realm of Alaskan economic development. In the early 1980s, she performed fieldwork in the upper valley of the Susitna River in anticipation of a hydroelectric dam project. From 1959 to 1963, she was the project director for ecological investigations for Project Chariot, a proposal by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to create an artificial harbor by detonating a suite of nuclear devices, the proposal subsequently abandoned. UAF researchers working on the project, among them Leslie Viereck and William O. Pruitt, objected to the way that the university's client, the AEC, had characterized findings in their progress reports; Kessel presented these objections to the university's president, William Ransom Wood in a meeting in October 1960. However, when Viereck, Pruitt, and others presented a \\"minority report\\" critical of Project Chariot in an issue of the News Bulletin of the Alaska Conservation Society in March 1961, Kessel considered their report biased and ethically flawed. Pruitt's research contribution to the overall project report, on the ecology of certain terrestrial mammals in the study area, was submitted to Kessel in December 1961. Kessel's edits of Pruitt's draft became a point of contention, and the final report appeared in April 1962 under William Pruitt's name, \\"as modified by\\" Brina Kessel. Two months before the final report, Kessel received correspondence from John N. Wolfe of the AEC; he wrote that Pruitt's version of the draft was \\"not highly satisfactory\\" and that the AEC's final payment to the University was \\"contingent upon the receipt of a satisfactory [final] report.\\" The degree to which Wolfe had an influence on the final report is not certain. Later life and death Brina Kessel was awarded emeritus status at UAF as dean, professor, and curator of ornithology in 1999. She died on March 1, 2016 in Fairbanks. Legacy and recognition Brina Kessel, through her estate, made a large gift to the University of Alaska to fund the Birds of Alaska project and to establish the Kessel Ornithology Endowment Fund. Brina Kessel was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1960. In 1973, she became one of the first women to be named a fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU); she served the AOU as president from 1992 to 1994. The AOU, now the American Ornithological Society, established the Brina C. Kessel Award to recognize an outstanding recent article published in The Auk: Ornithological Advances. Kessel was elected to fellowship in the Arctic Institute of North America in 1978. From the University of Alaska, she received its President's Distinguished Service Award in 1981. The Brina Kessel Medal for Excellence in Science is granted annually to an undergraduate student at UAF. Kessel Pond at Creamer's Field Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in Fairbanks was named in her honor.

History =The Barons of Gadgirth= Reginaldus de Camera, later Chalmer, is recorded to have held the Barony of Gadgirth as a hereditary possession, during the reign of William the Lion (1165-1214). The family continued in residence until circa 1761 and in 1800 Colonel Joseph Burnett, retired from the East India Company, purchased part of the old barony, including Gadgirth and the Old Ha' Castles. The name 'Chalmer' derives from the post of Lord or Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Camerarius Regii a position held by Herbert de Camera from 1124 to 1153, a member of the family who were of Saxon or Norman descent. In 1357 the 'Farthing Land of Gadgard (sic) is recorded its tithe and 50s as the assessed rent. The lands of Gaitgirth (sic) and Culreath were joined to form one Barony in 1468. In 1424 John Chalmer of Gadgirth fought for King Charles VII of France against the English at the Battle of Vernuie and was awarded the right to use the Fleur de Lis in recognition of his gallantry. He is thought to have died at the Battle of Herrings in 1429. Gravestone of John or William Chalmer at Coylton, dated 1693. Sir John Chalmer's wife Elizabeth was charged before the King's Council in 1494 as an adherent to the Lollard's, a heretical doctrine promulgated by John Wycliffe. The charge was dismissed by King James IV. James Chalmer of Gadgirth was a great supporter of the Scottish Reformation and was regarded by Archbishop Spottiswood and John Knox as one of the boldest of the leaders of the movement. In 1558, Mary of Guise, the Queen Regent, a supporter of the Catholic Church, was meeting with the Catholic bishops, when a delegation of reformers entered the privy chamber and James Chalmer addressed her, saying (in updated English) \\"Madam you know of the malice of the jail birds and that bastard that stands beside you (the bishop of St. Andrews). We swear to God we shall make a fight of it. They oppress us and our tenants, for feeding their idle bellies. They trouble our preachers, and intend to murder them and us. Shall we not put up with this any longer.‚Äù The reformers then put on their helmets as if they were about to use force. Mary quickly compromised with the reformers.\\"The Scottish Nation\\" - Chalmer of Gadgirth Annabelle Cunningham was the wife of James Chalmer and when she died in 1569 her will stated that \\"I do commend my spirit to Jesus Christ my onlie saviour and redeemer, in quhome and by quhome I luke for eternaljoy and felicite.\\" The laird of Gadgirth is recorded as having great misgivings relating to the economic control that the clergy had upon him and his tenants. In 1696 Captain John Chalmers inherited the barony as a minor from his father John, however almost all of the lands had passed into others hands as a result of debts incurred as a result of the Chalmer family supporting King Charles I. John managed to restore some of the barony lands to Chalmer ownership however he died circa 1750 without a male heir and the property passed to his sisters Mary, Anna and Elizabeth. Mary left her portion to her husband, John Steel of Gadgirth and his daughter by a second marriage, married Lieut-Colonel Joseph Burnett of the Bengal Artillery who purchased his sister-in-laws portion of the barony. James Muir, Elizabeth's eldest son, changed his name to Chalmer and inherited his aunt, Anna Chalmer's, portion of the barony. Grave of Francis Claude Burnett at Coylton old parish church. Joseph Burnett died in 1833 and his son John Joseph Burnett inherited however he never married and the barony passed to his brother Lieut-Colonel Francis Claude Burnett of the Bengal Artillery who died on August 19, 1897. He was buried with his wife Mary in the family mausoleum at the Coylton Kirk cemetery. The Chalmer's were connected through marriage with many families in Ayrshire and elsewhere, such as the Campbells of Loudoun, Hamiltons of Cadzow, Cuninghames of Caprington, Wallace of Ellerslie, Craufurd of Craufurdland, Fergusson of Craigdarroch, Farquhar of Gilmilnscroft, etc. The Chalmer of Gadgirth coat of arms is Argent, a demi- lion rampant, Sable, issuing out of a Fess, and in base, a Fleur-de-Lis: all within a border, Gules. Crest - a falcon, belled, proper. Motto - Non Praeda sed Victoria (Not spoiled by victory). The Burnett of Gadgirth coat of arms is Argent. Crest - A Holly Branch, green, with red berries. Shield - Three holly leaves on a white ground in the upper division; on the lower, a Hunting Horn. Motto - Nec Fluctu, nec Flatu (Neither by Wave nor Wind).. =Gadgirth Castle = The castle, probably a typical 14th century tower castle, replaced the earlier Gadgirth Old Ha' that stood around 500 metres or a quarter of a mile downstream on the same southern side of the River Ayr, abandoned when the new castle was built. Gadgirth Castle was itself demolished in 1808 when a new mansion house was built on its footprint by Colonel Joseph Burnett who had retired from his post with the East India Company. Joseph had intended to retain the castle however it proved to be unsuitable for modification with walls six feet thick. Extensive woodlands and a pale or fence are shown on Timothy Pont's map of the early 17th century indicating a deer park. A dwelling is shown on the 1775 Armstrong map that appears to indicate a house rather than a castle with planted woodlands and open parkland, with a road running to it via Enterkine and with a bridge across the River Ayr as confirmed by the dwelling named Bridgend. A print of 1892 by the artist Robert Bryden shows a castle that has been given some Georgian features such as regular windows and ornamental bartizan towers. It not known what source was used to create the print and therefore the accuracy of the image is unknown.Davis, Michael (1991). The Castles and Mansions of Ayrshire. Pub. privately. p.264. John Knox is known to have preached here dispensed the sacrament and Mary Queen of Scots is said to have stayed here for one night. =Gadgirth Old Ha'= As stated, the first castle, Gadgirth Old Ha', also lay on the southern side of the River Ayr near the B742 road that crosses the River Ayr at Gadgirth Bridge and runs up to Annbank. The castle jutted into the river on a rocky promontory with an islet located within the river at this point. The historian John Smith in the 1890s visited the site and recorded that even at that date only a short stretch of wall could be traced. =Gadgirth House= Gadgirth Holm Cottages. Built in 1808 on a prominent position overlooking the River Ayr and Gadgirth Holm it was purchased in 1949 by the council became a childrens home. It was demolished in 1968. It had been built on the site of Gadgirth Castle. As stated, the 1775 William Armstrong map appears to indicate a house rather than a castle with a road running to it via Enterkine and with a bridge across the River Ayr as confirmed by the name Bridgend. In 1828 the mansion house is clearly shown with a network of roads. Gadgirth House is shown on photographs and prints as a mansion with similarities to Logan House near Cumnock and probably designed by the same architect. It had \\"an advanced, eliptical, bowed projection on the centre of both main fronts, the projection on the garden front being further advanced than that on the entrance front\\". In 1903 alterations were carried out that were designed by the architects Honeyman, Keppie and Mackintosh. Gadgirth Holm Cottages - Dated 1906 on their monogram, a terrace of eight estate cottages in Arts and Crafts style were built just downstream from Gadgirth Bridge. The 1906 cottages replaced an earlier set cottages, a miner's row, on the site as shown on OS maps with two coal pits nearby. Gadgirth Mains This was the home farm and was built circa 1807. A courtyard design, it has a central arched entrance with a small dovecot above. An advert in 1807 refers to a set of farm offices that were to be built in the summer of 1808. On the 1750s map by William Roy a 'Gath Gard Mains' is already shown. A gasometer was located here to hold the coal gas made on site. Estate features - A walled garden survives which once had several greenhouses and other buildings associated with it. The OS maps also record a monument or obelisk built in the centre of one of two old 18th century wooded roundel features on top of the hill that lies above Gadgirth Mains.Ayrshire, Sheet XXXIV Publication date:1860 The monument bore no inscription and given the fashion of early 19th century memorials to Horatio Nelson, the Battle of Trafalgar or the Battle of Waterloo it may relate to one of these or a family linked origin. John Thomson's map of 1828 indicates an ornamental lake in front of Gadgirth House in the Byre Burn Glen, however this is no longer shown in 1908. In 1908 a sundial was shown on the OS in front of the mansion house. Gadgirth Cottage and Bankfoot Cottages were once situated on the lane to Knockshoggle Holm. The Kennels Cottage also survives as do the gates. =Gadgirth Viaduct= Enterkine or Gadgirth Viaduct. Also known as the Enterkine Viaduct this wrought iron bridge on stone pillars originally carried the old G&SWR; line from Ayr to Cronberry over the River Ayr, latterly it was used to carry coal trains to the Killoch washery. It was still in service in 2009. =Etymology= The name 'Gadgirth' is also variously written as 'Gadgard', 'Gaitgirth', 'Galdgirth'. and may either refer to an archaic Scots unit of land measurement or even the personal name 'Galdus', recorded as an ancient King of Scots commemorated at Wigton.Scottish Nation Chalmer 'Garth' or 'Girth' refers to an enclosure. The name is given as 'Gaidyant' on Timothy Pont's map of the early 17th century.Coila Provincia, The province of Kyle. Timoth. Pont. Imprint : Amsterdam : Blaeu, 1654 The same spelling is given in 1745.Moll, Herman. The South Part of the Shire of Air i.e. Ayr, containing Kyle and Carrick by H. Moll. 'Gath Gard' is the spelling shown on William Roy's map of the 1750s.Roy Military Survey of Scotland, 1747-1755 Armstrongs map of 1775 uses the spelling 'Gadgirth'.Armstrong, Andrew, 1700-1794. A new map of Ayrshire, 1775 Industry Remains of a Gadgirth Coal Pit. The ancient Privick Mills are located on the opposite bank of the River Ayr from the castles and mansion house sites with at one time extensive stone weir and lade carrying the water to the mill's wheel. It is marked as 'Preuik Mil' on Timothy Pont's early 17th century map and may have been associated with Privick House, later known as Annbank House, renamed after Lady Ann Montgomery but demolished in the 1970s.Love, Dane (2010). The River Ayr Way. Auchinleck : Corn Publishing. p. 102. A charter of 1359 does refer to a mill and grannary belonging to the lands of Gadgirth. At least two coal pits are recorded,Scottish Mining Website one lying above Gadgirth Mains with some ruins remaining and the other with an engine house in the Byre Burn Glen. In 1875 one miner was killed and a second mortally injured. William Kerr, aged around 50, was working in the No. 1 Gadgirth Pit, Annbank Colliery and had been excavating a wedge-hole when a one ton block of coal fell on him.

It was founded in 1906 and for years had a large membership, at times exceeding 3,000. 88 years after its foundation and 44 years after that of the Johannesburg South Reformed Church (NGK), however, the two congregations would merge to form the Deo Gloria Reformed Church on April 24, 1994. This was due in part to the emigration of Afrikaners toward more affluent neighborhoods as well as the burning down of the neglected Turffontein Church, which the congregation could not afford to rebuild, in March 1992. The merger ended the oldest congregation in southern downtown Johannesburg, from which sprang all others in the area.  Background  When the Johannesburg East Reformed Church (NGK) and the Jeppestown Reformed Church seceded from the oldest NGK church on the Rand, the Johannesburg Reformed Church (NGK), on July 8, 1897, Casey's Town (later known as Turffontein) became part of the Jeppestown congregation. Even before then, Johannesburg pastors Rev. J.N. Martins and Pieter Gerhardus Jacobus Meiring held services in a small meeting hall in Casey's Town. Serving the southern areas of Jeppestown proved especially challenging, since Rev. Paul Nel could only spare two Sundays a month to preach there. The Rev. Meiring (since then having moved to the Johannesburg East Reformed Church (NGK)) and Rev. Dani√´l Theron of the Fordsburg Reformed Church helped out at first, but had to be replaced by a missionary, brother MacLean, who himself remained there only a few months.  Turffontein church hall  The Jeppestown congregation building committee, on the recommendation of the church council, decided in June 1903 to replace the cramped, dilapidated local meeting hall with a new building and rent out the old one to schools after renovation. Several months later, T.D. Hannecke won the ¬£1,509 bid for construction, and on Saturday, July 30, 1904, Rev. Meiring laid the cornerstone. Speaking of the occasion, Rev. Nel said ‚Äúthat it will not be long before an independent congregation would be founded in Turffontein‚Äù (quoted in the August 1904 issue of the Transvaal NGK magazine De Vereeniging). It is not clear exactly when the building was finished and inaugurated. Hannecke's work was clearly done by mid-November, when the council decided at its meeting to wait to dedicate the building until after it was furnished. That August, the Jeppestown council accepted a separate ¬£400 bid for furniture and a pulpit from the Van Hoogstraten brothers. Whatever delayed delivery and thus the opening, the church was in operation before 1904 was out.  Leadup to secession  The August 26, 1903 issue of De Vereeniging told of the need for a new congregation to serve the suburbs south of the ‚ÄúReef‚Äù (the main gold vein). Of these, Ophirton and Booysens were part of Johannesburg East, and Turffontein and La Rochelle belonged to Jeppestown. The two congregations agreed to hire a curate to prepare the area for secession, an idea endorsed by both Dr. Hendrik Adriaan Lamprecht (Rev. Meiring's successor at Johannesburg East) and Rev. Nel at the August 1905 Jeppestown council meeting. The two congregations requested and received the help of Rev. J.D. de Villiers, at the time a curate for Jeppestown, to handle the task. For a little over two months, Rev. De Villiers worked among the members in the southern suburbs, some of whom submitted petitions for secession to their respective councils. In Early October 1905, the Ophirton and Booysens wards resolved at congregation meetings to submit secession petitions to the Johannesburg East council, which adopted by unanimous vote on the 10th the following motion: ‚Äúthe church council takes great notice of the meeting in Ophirton and the decision taken there, and is willing to entertain the request provided legal requirements are met.‚Äù The Turffontein ward members came to this conclusion as well around the same time. Within a week of Johannesburg East's above reply, Turffontein petitioned the Jeppestown council, asking ‚Äúfor the founding of a new church south of the Reef and funds to build a parsonage and maintain public services,‚Äù according to the council meeting notes. The council referred the issue to the Ring but declined to provide the money until similar contributions could be obtained from Johannesburg East. Several weeks later, Rev. Nel and two of the Jeppestown elders attended the Johannesburg East council meeting. After they pledged to deed property worth ¬£3,800 to the new congregation, namely several plots of land in Turffontein and La Rochelle where the local church halls were, the Johannesburg East council granted property worth ¬£1,600 in Ophirton and a stipend of ¬£250 a year for the first four years. Thus, the new congregation would start with three halls (including a new and well-furnished one in Turffontein) and ¬£1,000 in seed money.  Secession  With the foundation thus set, the Potchefstroom Ring Committee met on the morning of Wednesday, February 28, 1906 in the Turffontein church to officially declare the secession. That night, a congregation meeting elected the first council members in the same building. Two weeks later, the March 8 De Vereeniging reported on the foundation of ‚Äúa new congregation south of the Reef, named the La Rochelle Dutch Reformed Church.‚Äù The reported announced that a Jeppestown representative would serve as consulent and clarified the new congregation's boundaries.  Etymology of La Rochelle  Its name would spring from the local suburb of La Rochelle, which Ring Committee member Rev. Louw of Heidelberg compared to ‚ÄúThe Rock Christ.‚Äù The name of the suburb, of course, came from La Rochelle, France, the last fortress of the Huguenots of whom so many came to South Africa.  Early years  The congregation's first pastor were Revs. C.F. Mynhardt (1907‚Äì10) and S.W. van Niekerk (1911‚Äì21). The third, Rev. T.A. Broodrijk, was invested on October 29, 1921, and under him the parsonage was built and the congregation decided to build a church, which would be dedicated on September 4, 1925, though the organ would not be used until September 3, 1927. A 1929 tornado destroyed the hall alongside the new church, which would be replaced by a new one that opened in May 1930. The Rev. Broodrijk was assisted by proponent J.H. van Loggerenberg from December 1929 to September 1930. On May 17, 1932, the pastor reported to the council that all debts were paid, but he died on August 17 and would be buried in the churchyard. His wife and two children left the area on December 4, 1932, his gravestone emblazoned with the words ‚Äúhe did what he could.‚Äù The Rev. T.C. Esterhuysen served for the first nine months after Rev. Broodryk's death. Meanwhile, the council saw the need for further secession and therefore bought eight plots worth ¬£1,600 in Rosettenville. ¬£11,000 had been raised over the 11 years leading up to 1932 for the purpose.  La Rochelle becomes Turffontein  Rev. A.H. Stander (May 1933-April 1948) and J. de Jager (1948‚Äì58) saw tenures marked by heavy secessions. In 1938, the Rosettenville Reformed Church seceded, prompting the mother church to be renamed to Turffontein given La Rochelle belonging to the new Rosettenville territory. In August 1947, another congregation seceded, the Forest Hill Reformed Church. Within the first year of the Rev. and Mrs. De Jager's arrival as the fifth pastoral couple in the congregation, the Reverend warned the council of yet more departures. The secession of the Johannesburg South Reformed Church (NGK), officially finalized on November 15, 1950 in the Booysens police station cafeteria, was the third in eleven years and left Turffontein an urban congregation with around 980 members. ¬£3,000 in endowments were raised within a short time to improve Johannesburg South's buildings.  Merger with Johannesburg South  An additional factor in the April 24, 1994 merger with Johannesburg South as Deo Gloria, besides the March 1992 fire that destroyed Turffontein's church, was the retirement of Rev. J.L. Coetzee, second and final pastor of Johannesburg South from 1955 to 1994. According to the final NGK Yearbook, Turffontein in 1994 had 90 baptized members and 346 confirmed ones while Johannesburg South had respective figures of 62 and 252. The Johannesburg South church on the corner of Alamein and Faunce Roads in Robertsham is home to Deo Gloria, whose 58 baptized and 367 confirmed members of 2010 have been served by Rev. A.D.P. de Villiers since 1999.

In 1955 Espie joined the Australian Army, as a saper in the engineers and, later, was appointed a field engineer before leaving in 1961. On 14 August 1961 he started his training with the NSW Police Force where he worked to become Chief Inspector, the highest position ever held by an Aboriginal person. Espie was well respected in the police force and, in March 1965, received a lot of attention for his bravery when he rescued two trapped men, from separate burning cars. He retired from the police force, after 30 years of serve, in April 1991. During this time he received the following awards: * 1965, Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct * 1965, Commissioner's Commendation * 1965, Peter Mitchell Award * 1965, George Lewis Trophy * 1971, Commissioner's Commendation * 1977, Commissioner's Commendation * 1980, National Medal * 1988, First Class National Medal * Australian National Police Service Medal  Later life Espie died on September 22, 2011 in the Concord Repatriation Hospital in Sydney and his ashes were placed at the Alice Springs Garden Cemetery.  Legacy  There is a memorial to Espie at the Hartley Street School in Alice Springs, which is now operating as a museum. Much of Espie's memorabilia is on permanent display at the NSW Police Academy in Goulburn.

Venice and its empire, from the late middle ages through the early modern period, has been the primary site of her scholarly research, with a focus on how works of art and architecture can materialize and sum up significant aspects of the culture in which they were produced. Her recent work has focused on Venetian territories in the Mediterranean and the Terraferma, particularly the Friuli.  Biography  Brown was born and raised in Oakland, California, where she graduated from Fremont High School (1954). After attending Brigham Young University, she graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with an A.B. in Political Science (1959). Brown was active as a studio artist for 17 years and raised two sons before beginning graduate work. Returning to Berkeley in 1976, she earned an M.A. (1978) and PhD (1983) in the History of Art. Brown taught at Princeton for 27 years (1983-2010), where she was the first woman to be promoted to tenure (1989) in the Department of Art & Archaeology and served as department chair for six years (1999 -2005). Brown was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge (2000-2001). She served as president of the Renaissance Society of America (2000-2002), and was a member of the Board of Advisors for the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (2004-7). She serves on an Advisory committee for ‚ÄúMediterranean Palimpsests: Connecting the Art and Architectural Histories of Medieval and Early Modern Cities,\\" a Getty-funded research project (with research trips with the MCities group to Nicosia, Cordoba, Granada, Rhodes, and Thessaloniki), 2018-20, and has been a member of the Board of Trustees of Save Venice since 2004. In recognition of her retirement in 2010, Brown was honored with eight sessions at the annual meeting of the Renaissance Society of America in Venice, as well as with a symposium at Princeton University: \\"Giorgione and His Times: Confronting Alternate Realities\\" on the 500th anniversary of the death of Giorgione. Selected papers from the two symposia were published in a Festschrift edited by Blake de Maria and Mary E.

Article by Hertha Dopplinger (born Hertha Fuhrmann), 2008. It is part of the 14th borough Penzing.  History  Ceiling fresco at Fuhrmannhaus The history of the Fuhrmannhaus can be sourced back to the 17th century by a stair railing from the year 1687. This railing is part of the reconstruction after the Second Viennese Ottoman siege in 1683. At the site of the house, however, there is also evidence of a Roman watchtower and a medieval settlement, where today's Linzer Stra√üe (Linzer Street) applies as an important transport road to Linz since the 12th century. Furthermore, a barred tiny window from the time before 1500 is still preserved in the courtyard of the building. The Fuhrmannhaus has an art-historically valuable small hall with frescoes from the late 17th century. This hall is currently used for cultural events such as classical concerts and readings. Furthermore, the building accommodates a traditional Viennese wine tavern. In the courtyard art exhibitions and different markets are held, such as farmers' and Christmas markets. In the course of its more than three hundred years of history, the Fuhrmannhaus changed hands several times. Around 1680 it was acquired by the Barnabites who used the building as a farmyard as well as summer quarters for members of the monastery. In 1840, Franz Xaver Fuhrmann bought the house and operated a wagon company for several decades. Since then it remained in the possession of the heirs of the family Fuhrmann and thus received its present name.

Design and development The Ph√∂nix flying boat glider was built, like other Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft (LFG) boats, at their Stralsund works. It was designed by G. Baatz and first flew in 1922. Its cantilever shoulder wing was built around a single one piece plywood box spar. In plan the wings were straight-tapered and had long, semi-elliptical tips. They were thick in section and strongly cambered at the root, thinning steadily outboard, and had 8¬∞ of dihedral. Short but broad ailerons, mounted on the rear of the spar, extended to the tips. The Ph√∂nix's rectangular section hull had a single step on its planing surface. Externally the hull was covered with ply protected by waterproof canvas. Stability on the water was provided by totallly enclosed underwing, stepless floats out from the hull. Internally the hull was divided into a series of watertight compartments, with sealable doors in them for access. The pilot sat in an open cockpit between the wing leading edge and the nose, where an upward-opening towing hook, easily released from the cockpit, was mounted. Its fixed tail surfaces were generous and broad, with a swept, straight-edged, round topped fin and a roughly rectangular tailplane mounted on top of ihe fuselage. The rudder was flat and broad at its top but narrowed downwards. In contrast, a general arrangement (g/a) diagram shows very small elevators. Operational history In 1922-3 the Ph√∂nix was flight tested at Stralsund and at Rossiten, one base of the RRG and a home of German gliding in the 1920s. Some of these take-offs were made under wind power alone, with the Ph√∂nix moored to a buoy on a long, down-wind cable and rising like a kite. Others were made under motor-boat tow. In 1923 Flight referred to it as the Ph√∂nix 3 but nothing is known specifically about earlier models, though there are some differences between the g/a diagram and images, particularly for the rudder profile.

Though bandleader Ed Ackerson produced most of Pantomime and C'est La Vie himself, the band also worked with Alan Moulder (Smashing Pumpkins), Sean Slade, and Paul Q. Kolderie on several tracks. Completing C'est La Vie took longer than anticipated, so the band released an EP, Pantomime, in November 1996 before the full-length album which was ready the following April. Reception The EP was well-received by critics. Los Angeles Times pop-music critic Robert Hilburn said that \\"the music filters '90s sensibilities with all sorts of classic rock elements‚Äîfrom Beatles and Stones to R.E.M.‚Äîin the manner of Oasis and the Smashing Pumpkins. Polara serves warning in this EP that it has the vision and command to be a major player.\\" Jenny Eliscu of CMJ New Music Monthly said that \\"the real meat of each Polara song is a sharp, shining hook, a bouncy rhythm and an immediately accessible vocal melody. But since Ackerson's looked at sound boards from both sides now, there are always plenty of sound effects to act as the dressing on these tunes‚Äîa bit of Moog or Farfisa, some low-grade feedback or an unidentifiable drone.\\" Bryan Carroll of Allmusic said that the EP combined electronica, \\"a progressive political sensibility, and a love of cavernously huge-sounding production with the conventions of alternative rock,\\" but felt that the music \\"sounds flat and half-baked.\\" Track listing References Category:1996 EPs Category:Polara (band) albums ","title":"Pantomime (Polara EP)"},{"id":"62182543","text":"Gen. Hendrik Abraham Albert (Hoeko, near Ladismith, Cape Colony, April 7, 1855 - Honingfontein Farm, near Heidelberg, Transvaal, September 8, 1906) was a South African military commander, author, and businessman for whom the city of Alberton and the Johannesburg suburb of Albertville were named, as well as the 90-hectare Albert's Farm conservation area near Greymont. The General Alberts Primary School in Alberton is also named after him.  Background and youth  Alberts was the oldest son of Hendrik Abraham Alberts and Martha Magdalena Claassen of Heidelberg, Western Cape. He grew up on his father's farm, but little is known of his education other than that he was home-schooled by his mother at least sometimes. Later briefs and war correspondence show a high level of literacy. After marrying 17-year-old Petronella Johanna Oosthuizen of Ladismith when he was 19, they moved to near the other Heidelberg in South African Republic (ZAR) and settled near Heidelberg, where he would become a wealthy farmer by the outbreak of the Second Boer War.  Second Boer War  With the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, he enlisted in the Heidelberg commandos and was deployed to the Natal front. He participated in a number of battles, including the Battle of Spion Kop (January 24, 1900), in which he served as acting field cornet. After the occupation of Pretoria by British Army troops in June 1900, he retreated with the Heidelberg commandos to Machadodorp, where he served as commandant in place of Cmdt. Cornelis Johannes Spruyt, who had been promoted to general. He continued to serve in Spruyt's place when needed, such as when the latter and Gen. Louis Botha fought Gen. Horace Smith-Dorrien at the Battle of Lake Chrissie (February 6, 1901). When Gen. Spruyt was killed in action in July 1901, Alberts was promoted in his stead. He became Gen. Botha's right-hand man in East Transvaal, such as in the Battle of Bakenlaagte on October 30, 1901, where they defeated Lt. Col. George Elliot Benson. Alberts was then deployed with several Transvaal commandos to the Orange Free State, fighting over a wide area in tandem with Gen. Christiaan de Wet. At the Battle of Kalkkrans, in February 1902, he and the other Boer Republic forces were routed by the British lines, and he therefore had to join Gen. De Wet on a retreat into the Drakensberg. Afterwards, he returned to East Transvaal to harass British supply lines, in order to relieve pressure on Gen. Botha's forces. In May 1902, he was at the signing ceremony of the Peace of Vereeniging, where he spoke in favor of accepting the British peace proposal. When the commandos laid down their arms on June 5, 1902, at Kraal Station, he handed a letter of thanks to his officers.  Postwar  After the war, Alberts returned to work on his farm, but he needed to rebuild his house and barn from scratch. In time, thanks to several profitable real estate transactions, he restored his finances. He remained a fervent supporter of Gen. Botha and an active participant in local politics, including the foundation of the Het Volk Party in the C.N.O. School in Transvaal. Alberts also led a syndicate that purchased the ground where the city of Alberton, bearing his name, would one day stand. In 1905, he began to experience the heart disease that would soon end his life. A.P.J. van Rensburg wrote of him in the Suid-Afrikaanse Biografiese Woordeboek: \\"fatherlander par excellence, deeply pious, friendly, and approachable, he won a lasting place among the heroes of South Africa.\\" He was survived by three biological sons, two biological daughters, and an adopted son.  Albert's Farm  In the 1890s, according to tradition, Alberts leased 114 acres of the old farm of Waterval to its owner. The original homestead is long gone, but the fenced family graveyard remains. In 1946, Albert's descendants sold 45,000 m¬≤ for ¬£18,500 to the city council for public use.  Sources  * History of Albert's Farm. URL accessed 28 October 2019. * Kr√ºger, prof.

Recitationes were a literary practice of ancient Rome that involved one or more public readings (recitatio, pl recitationes) of a text. Some of these occurred in public places (theaters and baths), and even in the Roman Forum. History Before this public performance, authors would simply be known by their texts. These would be copied on scrolls by copyists, often freedmen of Greek origin, and were intended to be sold by these book publishers to wealthy people.Catherine Salle, Lire √† Rome, p.94 Starting towards at the end of the Republic, the recitations developed substantially under the Empire, especially under the reign of Augustus, thanks to the poet and politician Gaius Asinius Pollio who became well known because of the fashion for this new entertainment. The purpose of reading aloud in public was to make themselves known to an audience in order to obtain social and monetary protection: the recitations took place, for the most part, within privileged closed circles. Indeed, each person reciting was the prot√©g√© of a patron. The purpose of a reader was to secure his career by being the prot√©g√© of the wealthiest of patrons. The patron, a politician or wealthy public figure, paid his artist and commissioned works in which the patron was thanked; the latter could even appear as one of the characters in the text read. The orders were often intended to reproduce Greek works in Latin and in the Roman fashion of the moment. This Latinization of Greek literature was explicit: most Roman citizens, and at least all those who attended the recitations, were bilingual and knew Greek perfectly, a language of commerce and literature. Thus, in the Eclogues, Virgil takes up the Greek topos of the dialogue between shepherds of Arcadia and builds from there a poem in Latin meter. Horace, Virgil and Propertius were all famous authors of recitations. Some famous verses of the Odes of Horace make clear the stake of a recitatio: to erect an artistic monument as did the Greeks and by taking again the elements of their literature; to remain for posterity as one who will have settled in Rome a Latin literature reproducing the Greek literature : References Category:Ancient Roman leisure Category:Latin-language literature ","title":"Recitationes"},{"id":"62182599","text":"Justice Humphreys may refer to: *Allison B.

It was directed by Peter Medak and broadcast on Investigation Discovery. Plot The film tells the story of Rodney Alcala, a convicted serial killer believed to be responsible for over 130 murders. In 1978, he is caught after having raped and beaten 8-year-old Rosie Hoffman, but because her parents move her to Mexico, she does not testify at Alcala's trial, and he is charged only with assault. He is repeatedly charged with abusing girls, but his good behavior and kind manners gain him preferable treatment and light sentences. He is repeatedly declared reformed, enabling him to commit more murders. In 1978 he appeared on the television show The Dating Game in the midst of his killing spree. Alcala is ultimately identified by a park ranger who saw him walking with a murder victim named Tammy Jensen days before her body was discovered at the same location. This eyewitness account provides police with the evidence they need to finally arrest Alcala. In his Seattle storage locker they find the earrings Tammy Jensen was wearing when she disappeared, and he is sentenced to death. This conviction is overturned in 1984 due to the prosecution's reference to Alcala's previous crimes causing bias in the jury, but he is retried and sentenced to death again in 1986. A change in the law allows his DNA to be collected in 2002, connecting him to further murders. In 2010, Alcala represents himself at trial, calling on himself for testimony and answering his own questions. Rosie Hoffman returns 42 years after her attack to finally testify against her attacker, and her testimony as well as the testimony of Tammy Jensen's mother Carol help sentence Alcala to death for five counts of abduction, murder, and special circumstances. In 2012 he pleaded guilty to two more murders in New York. In 2016 he was charged with the 1977 murder of a woman in Wyoming.

In order to improve the abbey's discipline and economy, Notker fell back on the constitution of Hartmut as well as on that of Abbot Kerbodo of Lorsch, the visiting abbot from the time of his predecessor Purchart. His severity knew limits however, wherefore he was named abba benignus (\\"gentle abbot\\"). The first testimony of Saint Gall's ministerials can also be ascribed to Notker's reign. Notker reportedly established a small zoological garden to go along with the abbey's herb garden and orchard.

A committed women's rights activist, she campaigned for better working conditions for women, addressed problems associated with unhygienic homes and prostitution, and promoted the need for sexual education for girls. She fought for women's suffrage, contributing to the inaugural meeting of the Swedish Association for Women's Suffrage (FKPR) in June 1902. Internationally, in 1919 she represented Sweden at the founding of the Medical Women's International Association in New York and attended the First International Congress of Working Women in Washington, D.C. In the early 1930s, on behalf of the League of Nations, she was one of the three contributors to a report on the slave trade in women and children in the countries of Asia. Early life and education Born on 23 March 1872 in Torp, Medelpad, Alma Maria Katarina Sundquist was the youngest of the three daughters of the postmaster Johan Erik Sundquist and Katharina Kristina Holmer. After her father died, she moved with her mother and two sisters to Sundsvall. When their house was destroyed by the great fire of 1888, they moved to Stockholm where she graduated from the Wallinska high school in 1891. She then attended Uppsala University where she undertook preparatory studies for medicine and philosophy. During her schooling, she met fellow student, Ada Nilsson. The two women became friends as well as colleagues and in 1892 joined founder Lydia Wahlstr√∂m as a member of the Uppsala Women's Student Association, along with Ad√®le Philipson, Gulli Rossander, Signe Trygger, among others. Karolinska Institute, Stockholm Despite medical practice regulations which barred women from working in public hospitals, she went on to study medicine at the male-dominated Karolinska Institute. While in medical school, Sundquist and Nilsson experienced discrimination from faculty members who refused to give them higher marks than male students. Graduating in 1900, the following January, Nilsson and Sundquist wrote a plea, signed by almost every woman doctor in the country, as well as many female medical students, protesting their inability to work even as paediatricians or on behalf of women patients, except in private practices. Sundquist pointed out that the Royal letter of 1873, which accredited the degree programmes for \\"candidates of medicine\\" at the Karolinska Institute, contained no such restrictions. Since women had been admitted to study there in 1870, she demanded the right to work in public facilities. Career =Early career (1901-1918)= In 1901, Sundquist opened a private practice in Stockholm which she ran until 1939. Specializing in gynaecology, venereal diseases and dermatology, she taught hygiene in girls' schools and lectured on sexual education throughout the country. She was instrumental in providing access to contraception via physicians' prescriptions and furthered research on venereal diseases. Simultaneously, from 1902 to 1918, she served as the physician at the private girls' and in 1903 began working at the Stockholm City Polyclinic specializing in sexually transmitted diseases. At the clinic, she treated patients who lived in extreme poverty in unsanitary conditions, many of them prostitutes. She saw first hand the damage that prostitution regulations caused for them, and supported reformers like , who called for the sex trade to be decriminalized and regulation to cease. Sundquist's medical experiences led to her commitment to social reforms addressing the issues women encountered. She was a pioneering campaigner for women's suffrage, joining the board at the inaugural meeting of the Society for Woman Suffrage () in June 1902, though she resigned the following year. From the end of 1903 until early 1904, she worked on the regulatory Committee for the Prevention of Infectious Sexually Transmitted Diseases and in 1904, was elected to membership of the newly established Dermatological Society. The law barring women physicians from working in public facilities was overturned by new legislation in 1909. In 1910, Sundquist joined the board of the recently formed Swedish Society for Racial Hygiene (SSR), an organization founded on the principles of the European Eugenics Movement, but after one year, she was no longer listed on the board. That year, wanting both to control immoral behaviour and address the declining birth rate in the country, the Riksdag passed a contraception law (Criminal Code, Chapter 18. ¬ß 13, commonly known as ' after Hinke Bergegren, the first person prosecuted under it). The law provided that those disseminating public information on contraceptives or involved in their sale could receive sentences of up to two years in prison. Sundquist was very critical of the Contraception Act and began writing various articles about the spread of venereal diseases, as well as on improving working conditions for women and granting suffrage. She was a co-founder of the Swedish Association for Parental Protection and Sexual Reform, established in 1911, where she campaigned against prostitution. In 1916, Sundquist participated in two conferences for women physicians and medical students, which were spearheaded by Wahlstr√∂m. They led to the establishment of the Women Doctors' Permanent Committee () which aimed to press for changes to laws which prevented women from working as professionals in the medical field, and to assist other women academics in similar endeavours. Among those involved were Nilsson, Andrea Andreen, Elin Odencrants, and Nanna Svartz. One of their first acts was to write to the National Medical Board and press for more supervisory positions for women. In the attached report, they documented that the majority of medical candidates were women, that women were equally capable of treating male patients and that of the 49 licensed women physicians, 20 had already individually been granted supervisory rights when no male doctors were able to take the post. =Later career (1919-1939)= In March 1919, Sundquist announced to audiences in the United States that women's suffrage had been granted by the first chamber of the Riksdag to all women over age 23. She noted that the property restrictions for voting had been removed and that approval by the second chamber, which would include the right to stand for office, was imminent. In May, full suffrage was granted and Sundquist made plans to attend several conferences in the United States in the fall. She arrived on 17 September to attend the International Conference of Women Physicians, sponsored by the YWCA. During the conference, she argued in favour of sex education in schools, which had recently passed in Sweden. Though American physicians agreed that education was needed, they advocated for home instruction on the subject. On 21 October, a dinner was held for women physicians attending the conference and they decided to form the Medical Women's International Association. Sundquist was elected to serve on the Committee of Twelve to organize the association, whose purpose was to work together internationally to advocate for women to be granted full citizenship and to create a progressive programme to promote public health. Moving on to Washington, D.C., in late October, Sundquist attended the First International Congress of Working Women, as a member of its executive committee. The purpose of the conference was to ensure that labour reform addressing rights and standards for both women and men that included the abolition of child labour, compulsory education, equal opportunity for employment, equal pay for equal work, and the establishment of minimum wages and maximum hours was adopted by the newly formed International Labour Organization. In a presentation on labour conditions in Sweden, she reported that children of 14 and over could work if a physical examination proved they were able. She also noted that women had been pushed out of jobs that they had performed during the war and were seeking the right to continue in them. Sundquist participated in the 1922 Constitutive Assembly of the Medical Women's International Association held in Geneva and was later elected president of the organization, serving from 1934 to 1937. She continued to press for economic reforms. The passage of the opened civil service careers to women. In 1926, she assisted in the reorganization of the Women's Doctors Permanent Committee to the Women's Physicians' Club, to which she was elected chair in 1929. Sundquist portrait by Goodwin In 1930, along with Bascomb Johnson, an American writer, and , a Polish diplomat, Sundquist was appointed by the League of Nations to prepare a report on the slave trade in women and children in Asia. When the report was completed in 1932, the three were appointed to a travelling commission and charged with compiling information of a more international nature, since the first report focused on national statistics. They began in Japan and from there travelled to China, Indochina, Indonesia and India, before moving on to Tehran, Bushehr, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Haifa, and worked cooperatively with various government officials to obtain information. In 1938, the Contraception Act she had opposed for so long was abolished. She continued her private practice until 1939. Death and legacy Alma Sundquist died in Stockholm on 7 January 1940. She is remembered as one of Sweden's most prominent pioneering venereologists in the first half of the twentieth century, actively engaged in solving social and political challenges faced by women. Through her work, she brought the consequences of sexually transmitted diseases to the Swedish authorities and consulted on developing policy for prevention and treatment of them. She was committed to changing laws to improve conditions for women, as well as eradicating protective legislation which treated people differently based on gender.

Early life James Kitchenman was born in Barnsley, England, on November 19, 1825, to Richard Kitchenman and Phoebe Foster Kitchenman. He was a young lad when he accompanied his parents on the long voyage across the Atlantic to the new world. His financial resources in youth were very limited and necessitated his securing a position when a young lad that he might provide for his own support. Career =Dyes= Kitchenman therefore sought and secured a position in a dye house and as he became familiar with the business determined to engage in the same line some day on his own account. At length his unfaltering industry and careful expenditure made this course possible and he established a dyeing business, which he conducted for a considerable period in a most successful manner. =Carpets= Crompton Loom In fact his prosperity in that connection enabled him to engage in the manufacture of carpets with Samuel Horner and his brother at Amber and Letterly streets. After the dissolution of that partnership he turned his attention to the manufacture of ingrain carpets and woolen and worsted yarns, having a large plant at Huntingdon and Jasper streets. Subsequently, he was joined in a partnership by George M. Neal in the manufacture of body Brussels and Axminster carpets, the enterprise being conducted under the firm style of Kitchenman & Neal. With the growth of the business he kept increasing his facilities, adding to his mill until he had one of the largest and finest manufacturing enterprises in Kensington. He used the Markland loom of 1868, and later the more efficient Crompton & Knowles ingrain looms. =Hosiery= He also took up the manufacture of hosiery, which he carried on a large scale at Amber and Letterly streets. The attractiveness of design and the excellence of quality in all of his manufactured products brought him substantial success, his sales annually increasing until he became recognized as one of the most prominent manufacturers of eastern Pennsylvania. About fifteen years prior to his demise he retired from active business, although he still retained his mill at Jasper and Huntingdon streets. He has come to be classed with those men whose intelligently directed industry and effort have numbered them with the capitalists of Philadelphia. Family James Kitchenman memorial in Laurel Hill Cemetery Mr. Kitchenman was married in Philadelphia in the 1850s to Miss Margaret Crawford, a daughter of William Crawford, who was an early resident of this city. They became the parents of five children: Anna, Clara, Margaret, Elizabeth and Mary. Mary married G. S. Coyne of the George S. Coyne Chemical Co. Among their descendants are the artist Elizabeth Kitchenman Coyne and Republican former member of the U.S. House of Representatives James K. Coyne III. James Kitchenman was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at one time and he attended the Bethel Presbyterian church in North Philadelphia. His political allegiance was given to the Democratic party. In 1885, he was proposed as a candidate for Sheriff of Philadelphia, by a committee from the Knights of Labor, who applauded him as a Democrat, businessman, and \\"friend of labor\\" who sought to protect workingmen's rights to fair wages. He was a public-spirited citizen, as was manifested by his support of the various projects and movements instituted for the general good. Moreover, he was kindly and charitable and few men have realized more fully the responsibility of wealth. His last years were spent in honorable retirement from business in an attractive home at 1024 West Lehigh Avenue, Philadelphia, where he remained until his death, which occurred on Christmas Day of 1909.

It consisted of three companies of prewar militia and one newly recruited company together organized under the command of Major (later Brevet Major General) Charles Devens. The term \\"rifles\\" was a designation frequently given to antebellum militia companies which trained in the use of rifled muskets--a relatively new innovation at the time--as opposed to smoothbore muskets. Only minor differences in training and tactics differentiated such units from a typical infantry company of the time. During the 1840s, \\"rifle\\" companies were often expected to train and serve as skirmishers in open order, however by the Civil War, United States army tactics manuals made no distinction between a company of \\"rifles\\" and a typical infantry company. The organization of the battalion began on April 19, 1861 in response to Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteer troops at the start of the war. When they departed, the 3rd Battalion completed the required quota from Massachusetts under that initial call. For most of its term, the battalion served garrison duty at Fort McHenry in Baltimore. They did not see combat. The unit returned to Massachusetts and was mustered out on August 3, 1861. Two of its members died of disease. Unit organization Members of the Worcester City Guards, a company of Massachusetts Militia, in 1860 At the start of the Civil War, the 3rd Battalion consisted of three militia companies headquartered in Worcester, Massachusetts. On April 19, 1861, one week after Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter, Major Devens ordered his battalion to assemble in Worcester to prepare for active service. On April 20, the three companies formed up in front of Worcester City Hall. The same day, Devens received orders from Governor John Andrew to depart for Washington, D.C.. The \\"Worcester City Guards\\" made up Company A of the battalion. The unit was formed in 1840 as part of the Massachusetts militia. The circumstances leading to its creation arose from local political tensions arising out of the election of 1840 as the older Worcester Light Infantry company split along party lines. Those who belonged to the Whig Party left the older group to form the Worcester City Guards. At the start of the Civil War, the company was commanded by Captain Augustus R. B. Sprague. The \\"Holden Rifles\\" of Holden, Massachusetts formed Company B. The unit was established in 1856 and at the start of the war was commanded by Captain Joseph H. Gleason. The \\"Emmett Guards\\" of Worcester formed Company C. The unit was organized in 1858 and commanded by Captain Michael McConville. Company D was recruited in Boston beginning on April 19, 1861. In a single day, the company had enough volunteers to fill out its roster. Captain Albert Dodd, who oversaw the recruiting, served as the company commander and the company became known as \\"Dodd's Rifles.\\" The three Worcester County companies departed by train from Worcester on April 20. They arrived at Annapolis, Maryland on April 24 and remained there until May 2 when they were transferred to Fort McHenry. The Boston company departed on May 2 aboard the steamship Cambridge and arrived in Washington via the Potomac River. It was the first troop transport ship to reach Washington via the Potomac in response to Lincoln's call for troops. The company spent twelve days in Washington and then joined the rest of the battalion at Fort McHenry. The battalion was then mustered into United States service at Fort McHenry on May 9. Wartime service Fort McHenry in 1861While serving garrison during at Fort McHenry, the battalion drilled in infantry maneuvers and trained to operate the heavy artillery of the fort. Men of the 3rd Battalion also periodically took part in patrols down the Chesapeake Bay. Their duty was described as heavy and the men suffered from overwork. Though they never took part in combat, the unit also suffered greatly from illness, particularly during July. Two members of the battalion died of disease. At the close of the 90-day term, the battalion was asked by Major General John Adams Dix to remain at Fort McHenry for another two weeks due to a shortage of garrison troops. Though twelve men decided to return home at the end of their term, the great majority of the battalion remained another two weeks at Fort McHenry as requested. They departed for home on July 29 via railroad and arrived in Worcester on August 2. They were mustered out of service on August 3, 1861.

The organisation is based in Kollbrunn in the Canton of Z√ºrich. The mission of the foundation is to improve the quality of animal shelters and animal welfare projects, to prevent animal suffering and to promote animal welfare at the national and international level.  Activities  The SUST's activities take place on both national and international level and consist of emergency aid and the four areas: shelter support, neutering campaigns, information to the public and training of specialists. = Emergency aid = Emergency aid ensures the survival of animals in Switzerland and other countries * Help for animals of marginalised people in Switzerland: animal food for destitute pet owners, veterinary care, free spaying and neutering of dogs and cats. * SUST sponsors the Swiss ‚ÄûLarge Animal Rescue Service‚Äú GTRD in the campaign \\"Farm animals as well deserve professional rescue\\". * Laying hen campaigns in Switzerland: Find a new home for hens from large poultry farms, which would otherwise be sorted out and killed at the age of about one year. * Rescue of amphibians in Switzerland: During the spawning season, volunteers bring toads and frogs safely across the streets. * Professional care of injured and sick animals in the four SUST Orphan Animal Hospitals in Romania, Egypt and Peru. The foundation pays clinic equipment, drugs, surgeries, therapies, food and care in the animal orphanage hospitals. Veterinary services are therefore offered for free to the owners and their animals. The organisation often also finances the construction of the corresponding clinic. * Support of rabies vaccination for animals such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018. * Veterinary treatment, hoof and dental care for working horses and donkeys of destitute owners in Romania and Egypt by SUST veterinarians and farriers of different partner organisations. = Animal shelter support = The Susy Utzinger Animal Welfare Foundation supports animal shelters and animal protection projects. The SUST aims at species-appropriate animal husbandry, adequate veterinary treatment and professional care. During work assignments, teams of animal welfare workers evaluate organisational and structural problems and reorganise processes in order to optimise animal shelters. They carry out construction work, commission craftsmen and provide veterinary first aid. In addition, the foundation supplies building materials, animal equipment and fodder. The foundation collects, disinfects, sorts and delivers about 75 tons of animal utensils to needy animal shelters every year. = Neutering campaigns = Large-scale neutering campaigns are intended to reduce the overpopulation of street animals, who often live under difficult conditions. The Foundation cooperates with veterinarians in Switzerland and abroad and regularly carries out spay-and-neuter missions on site. The organisation sponsors campaigns focusing on feral cats and dogs and those living on farms, finances feeding stations and supplies material for castration campaigns, such as dog traps. In the SUST Orphan Animal Hospitals in Romania, Egypt and Peru, castrations are also carried out regularly. Posters, leaflets and brochures inform the public and sensitise them to the topic. In 2018, about 12000 cats and dogs were neutered in Switzerland and abroad. = Information to the public = Media reports, information campaigns, public lectures and free distribution of brochures and flyers inform the public about current issues and problems in animal welfare, husbandry and protection. School visits and the delivery of booklets for children in different languages sensitise children in Switzerland and abroad to animal welfare. = Education and training = The Susy Utzinger Animal Welfare Foundation Academy offers courses on the handling and care of animals and on the management of animal shelters and animal welfare projects. The seminars and lectures target veterinarians, animal keepers, dog trainers, volunteers and animal friends. A trainee programme prepares young Swiss veterinarians for animal welfare missions and neutering campaigns. By co- founding the ‚ÄûSwiss Association for Animal Welfare Work‚Äú (Verband Arbeitswelt Tierschutz Schweiz), the organisation promotes a new profession \\"Animal Welfare Expert\\". In cooperation with partner projects in different countries, the foundation supports animal welfare seminars on site and veterinary trainings on population control, effective neutering and anesthesia techniques.  Organisation  = Founding board = The Board of the Susy Utzinger Animal Welfare Foundation is the strategic management body and controls and guides the organisation on the medium and long term. The Board and its meetings are chaired by the Foundation President, which since 28.01.2019 is Philippe Sami Kayasseh. = Staff = alt= The foundation operates out of Kollbrunn with managing director Susy Utzinger and six part- time employees. The organisation cooperates with numerous partner projects worldwide.  Financing and support  = Financing = The Susy Utzinger Animal Welfare Foundation is financed by donations and bequests. In 2018, around 36400 individuals donated almost 1.13 million Swiss francs to the Susy Utzinger Foundation. In 2018, 36 percent of the funds went to projects in Switzerland, 64 percent were used for measures in other countries. The Foundation is under the supervision of the Federal Government. The annual accounts and the activity report are audited annually by the Federal Department of Home Affairs within the framework of the statutory supervisory obligation. = Animal welfare volunteers = In 2018, 193 volunteers and veterinarians contributed in their spare time to the work and activities of the Susy Utzinger Animal Welfare Foundation or supported the administrative development of the Foundation.

She was recognised posthumously as Righteous Among the Nations for aiding and rescuing Jews during the Holocaust.  Life  Hedwig V√∂lker was born in 1900 in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg. In 1926 she married Walter Porsch√ºtz, who was then a chauffeur and would later be conscripted into the Wehrmacht. During the Great Depression she became a prostitute, and in 1934 she was accused of blackmail and sentenced to ten months in prison. = World War II = From 1940, Porsch√ºtz worked in Otto Weidt's workshop for the blind as a stockroom worker and later stenotypist. They were in close contact, and she significantly assisted Weidt's effort to protect his employees by hiding Jewish women in her home and illegally trading for supplies. The twins Marianne and Anneliese Bernstein stayed in Porsch√ºtz' apartment for six months starting from January 1943. In March they were joined by Grete Seelig and Lucie Ballhorn. Occasionally prostitutes would use the apartment - then the occupants would have to wait outside until the clients were gone. When the situation ultimately became too dangerous, due to police raiding another apartment in the same building in mid-1943, the Bernstein twins relocated to Wilmersdorf while Porsch√ºtz' mother sheltered the other two women. Three of the four would survive the Holocaust. Goods Porsch√ºtz bought on the black market would be given to persecuted Jews and used to bribe Gestapo officers. Otto Weidt's group sent more than 150 food parcels to Theresienstadt Ghetto to supply at least 25 people imprisoned there. Porsch√ºtz also procured forged documents for Inge Deutschkron. Due to her black market trade, Porsch√ºtz was sentenced to 18 months in prison in October 1944 by a Nazi Sondergericht. For a time she was imprisoned in Zillerthal-Erdmannsdorf, a subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp. = Later life = After the war, her activities went unrecognised for many years. Her requests to be compensated for political persecution and to be titled an \\"Unsung Heroine\\" were rejected by West Berlin authorities in 1959. Authorities at the time did not consider helping Jews an act of resistance. Due to her prior work as a prostitute Porsch√ºtz was regarded as an immoral and dishonourable person. The 1944 judgement, despite having been delivered by a political court, was used against her. She died poor in 1977; no known photos of her exist.  Legacy  It took until November 2010 for Porsch√ºtz to be honoured by the city of Berlin with a memorial plaque, which was later placed at her former address (Feurigstra√üe 43). By 2011 the 1944 judgement was repealed on the basis that the Nazi court made political judgements to execute the \\"F√ºhrer's will\\". Yad Vashem recognised her as Righteous Among the Nations in 2012, a commemoration ceremony was held three years later. A street in Berlin Mitte was named in her honour in 2018 (Hedwig-Porsch√ºtz-Stra√üe).

Uhtingos deck is teak and the yacht requires a crew of 7 and has space for 11 guests. Service history The yacht was constructed by George Lawley & Sons at their yard in Neponset, Massachusetts in 1930. Named Cleopatra, the vessel was ordered for A. C. Murphy of New York. With the onset of World War II in 1939, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) intended to augment the local sea defences of coastal ports. The Royal Canadian Navy sought large, steel-hulled yachts to requisition. However, a significant lack of capable vessels were owned by Canadians. Canada turned to its southern neighbour for suitable ships, finding several that met the navy's requirements. However, US neutrality laws prevented their sale to belligerents in the war. In order to circumvent these laws, the RCN requisitioned the yachts of prominent Canadian yachtsmen and then sent them to the US to purchase the yachts that had been identified by the navy without the US government knowing they were working for the navy. The money to acquire the vessels was provided by the Canadian government through bank loans. Ralph P. Bell was a shipping operator, owner of several offshore companies and past secretary of the Halifax Relief Commission along with being a member of the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Club. Bell was among those selected by the RCN to be sent south to acquire new yachts. Bell was directed to purchase Cleopatra and dealt with yacht brokers in New York City to acquire the vessel. The yacht sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia on 3 June 1940 along with for conversion to an armed yacht at Quebec City, Quebec. Conversion to an armed yacht involved removing most of the luxurious finery and installing naval hardware. On top of the installation of armament, Moose required further alterations, including the fitting of bilge keels to improve stability and modifying the stern, to accommodate the depth charge rails. The ship was commissioned into the RCN on 8 September at Quebec City and was then assigned to the Halifax Local Defence Force. Moose remained with this unit until May 1942, when the yacht was reassigned to Sydney, Nova Scotia. The main gun was removed due to a lack of surface threat for Allied merchant shipping in the region, but the depth charges were kept. In May 1943, Moose was taken off frontline service and sent to the training establishment and used as a training ship and examination vessel. Additionally, the armed yachts stationed at Cornwallis would escort the ferry Princess Helen on run between Saint John, New Brunswick and Digby, Nova Scotia after the sinking of the ferry . Moose was paid off on 20 July 1945. In 1946, the ship was sold to Marine Industries Ltd. and was renamed Fraternit√©. The vessel was reconverted into a pleasure yacht for Joseph Simard, president of Marine Industries. In 1956, the ship was sold to W. E. Pennick of New Orleans, Louisiana and renamed Ottelia. Ottelias ownership was then transferred to A. H. Schaupeter who utilised the yacht in the Gulf of Mexico until 1974. That year, Schaupeter sold the vessel to the Gibraltar firm, Green Seas. Ottelia was re-registered to Southampton, England and home ported in Monaco. The yacht, still in service, has seen several further ownership and name changes, including Shogun, Naroma, Eretria, Candida A and Uthingo.

They participate annually in the Palio di Legnano. Generality =The active contrade= A moment of the historic parade of Palio di Legnano 2015 The eight contrade of Legnano, whose mottos were introduced in 1955,Ferrarini, p. 178. are: * 18px Contrada La Flora: \\"let seed be virtue, victory be flower\\" * 18px Contrada Legnarello: \\"alone in the Sun\\"; * 18px Contrada San Bernardino: \\"the bridge links virtue to glory\\"; * 18px Contrada San Domenico: \\"in the green hope\\"; * 18px Contrada San Magno: \\"not always winners, but always first\\"; * 18px Contrada San Martino: \\"to the end\\"; * 18px Contrada Sant'Ambrogio: \\"they hate me, as long as they fear me\\"; * 18px Contrada Sant'Erasmo: \\"love and splendor in battle on the hill thanks to the crow\\". A moment of the horse race of the Palio di Legnano 2014 The antagonism and the competition between the contrade are very much felt, with a strong collegiate component and particularly in the period of the year in which the PalioFerrarini, p. 177.D'Ilario, 2000, p. 6. is organized, without prejudice to the mutual respect that leads to mutual aid in the organization of the event as in the case, for example, of the frequent exchanges of the material used in the parade.D'Ilario, 1984, p. 337. To avoid the pranks, which are frequent near the date of the Palio, the horses participating in the horse race, the night before the latter, are hidden in a secret place and cared for by the Contrada members.Autori vari, p. 190. There are two contrade in Milan that have an additional title in the name; San Magno also has the term \\"noble\\" in its name, which derives from the territory of the contrada, which includes the historic center of Legnano, and from the fact that since ancient times, within the confines of the contrada, there are several families of noble lineage, while La Flora has as title \\"sovereign\\", attribution that was officially granted by the House of Savoy, ruling dynasty in Italy from 1861 to 1946. =The contrade suppressed= * 18px Contrada Olmina * 18px Contrada Ponzella In the first years in which the Palio of Legnano was disputed there were also the Contrada Ponzella and the Contrada Olmina, which were incorporated, respectively, by San Bernardino and La Flora (in 1936), and by Legnarello (in 1937); they were merged in the 1930s because at the time the neighborhoods to which they referred were not very inhabited, and therefore had difficulty in financially supporting the participation in the Palio.Autori vari, p. 126. The banners of the two suppressed contrade still participate in the historical parade of the Palio of Legnano; in particular, they follow the banner of the contrade to which they have been annexed, supplies of their armed escort. The two suppressed contrade had no motto: the latter were in fact introduced in 1955, three years after the suppression of these contrade. The manors The hall of honor of the Contrada San Martino, located in the manor of the historic Legnano contrada The contrade are located in the so-called \\"manors\\"; sometimes the manors, which are the property of the contrade, are housed in ancient Lombard courts, that is to say in buildings particularly linked to the territory, especially to that of the historical contrada of which they are the seat. At the center of the contrada there is the hall of honor, which is furnished in medieval style.Autori vari, p. 193. The manors are places open to all that host the meetings and activities of the contrada.D'Ilario, 2000, p. 6.D'Ilario, 1984, p. 343. The various rooms preserve the costumes of the past and present, while weapons and flags are placed in the racks installed on the walls; the display cases instead house the jewels and ornaments during the parade, as well as the gifts received by the contrade over time. Inside the contrada there is also the documentary archive of the contrada. The contrade are often the destination for school trips, during which students can immerse themselves in the medieval atmosphere. The organization and the regency The regency of the Contrada San Domenico in 1973. The first on the left is Vittorio Ciapparelli, first winner of the Palio of Legnano (1935). You can see the pectoral cross worn by the captain around his neck, symbol of victory in the previous palio. Each of the eight contrade of Legnano has a regency formed by a \\"captain\\", a \\"great prior\\" and a \\"chatelaine\\". The captain of the contrada is the one who represents the contrada on all official occasions and has the task of choosing the jockey and the horse participating in the horse race. In all official ceremonies he wears a white cloak and as a distinctive sign he has a patent parchment.Autori vari, p. 192. The captain, depending on the contrada, can be elected by the general assembly or by its members.Autori vari, p. 191. The function of grand prior, which was established in 1971, has the function of assisting the captain in his duties. He is also the legal representative of the contrada and checks that the status of the contrada is applied. The grand prior, in all official ceremonies, wears a black cloak, while as a distinctive sign he has a shield with cross-shaped features and a parchment. Next to the great prior is his deputy, who takes his place in his absence. The Visconteo castle of Legnano, site of the \\"College of captains and contrade\\" The chatelaine, like the captain and the great prior, has a representative role in official ceremonies and has the task of participating in the organization of the contests in the contrada. The chatelaine, who are helped in their job by the great ladies, are united in the association \\"Oratorio delle castellane\\", which also unites the most non-regent chatelaine. The chatelaine, in all official ceremonies, wears a red cloak, while as a distinctive sign she has a medal and a parchment. Another important office of the contrada is the squire, who helps the captain in the performance of his duties. The squire can also supply the captain in the events organized by the contrada and as a distinctive sign he has a shield with cross-shaped features. All the official ceremonies of the Palio are organized and cared for by the masters of ceremonies of the College of captains and contrade. The captains are gathered in the College of captains and contrade, whose function is to coordinate the activities, actions and intentions of the same. This College was born in 1955,Ferrarini, p. 183. is located inside the Visconteo Castle of Legnano and is presided over by the grand master of the captains' college, who is elected every two years. On the occasion of the elections, which take place in a social assembly called \\"session\\", his deputy, the directors of the executive, the auditors and the arbitrators are also voted. Other functions of the college of captains are the preservation of the traditions of Legnano and its contrade. The college has as its official banner a white-red banner (colors of the municipal coat of arms of Legnano) bearing the cross of Aribert and the coats of arms of the contrade. The activities Propitiatory dinner in the Contrada San Magno for the Palio di Legnano 2015 During the year the contrade organize parties, cultural and historical events, as well as folklore and charity events.Ferrarini, p. 177. In the first decades of existence of the event, the manors were frequented only during the month preceding the Palio, but with the passing of the years the activities of the contrade experienced a constant phase of growth that led the historical contrade to diversify the initiatives, with the organization of the latter taking place throughout the year. The contrade have often been protagonists, even financially, in the restoration of historic buildings in the contrada, such as the churches to which the contrade refer.Autori vari, p. 196. The activities of the contrade are manifold.Autori vari, p. 194. They range from periodicals to publications, to the preparation of popular festivals such as the grape festival, horse, bread, etc., as well as the organization of antique markets, dance classes, embroidery, ceramics, painting and preparation of ski competitions, soccer and table football tournaments. Conferences and evenings are then organized focusing on history, poetry, dance and music, as well as concerts and charity events. The contrade of Legnano also operate in the social context, helping the disabled, families in difficulty and the elderly hospitalized in the centers of the area, to which they also provide moral support by making periodic visits. Of great attraction is the propitiatory dinner on the eve, which is organized the evening before the Palio and which is greeted by the contrada decked out for a party, attended by hundreds of Contrada members and the jockey who will race the horse race. In the first editions of the event the dinner on the eve was the prerogative of the jockey and the elders of the contrada: only later was it decided to open the participation to all the volunteers that revolve around the contrada; the latter, on the eve of dinner, wear scarves from their own contrada.Autori vari, p. 197. Sometimes at the dinner on the eve there is also, in an enclosure, also the horse that will race the next horse race. The eight contrade =La Flora= right It is located in the \\"Oltre Stazione\\" area (i.e. west of the Domodossola‚ÄìMilan railway), to the north-west of the city. Legend has it that the contrada owes its name to the joyful exultation of the women of the neighborhood after the battle of Legnano. After the victory, with the passage of the Lombard League, the contradaiole of La Flora would have thrown flowers at the feet of the soldiers, hence the name of the contrada. According to this tradition, the red color symbolizes the blood of Lombard soldiers while the blue one symbolizes military glory. The meaning that today is associated with the colors of the contrada is instead the following: red indicates courage, ardor, strength and tenacity, while blue chivalrous loyalty. Another popular legend tells that Frederick Barbarossa was defeated in the battle of Legnano due to a glittering cross shown by the goddess Flora, who frightened the emperor and forced him to flee. The goddess Flora is very present in the popular beliefs of the place: according to tradition this mythological figure appeared every year in early spring to scatter flowers on the fields of the contrada.Autori vari, p. 177. On one occasion it appeared late and spread, on the lawns of the contrada, blue cornflowers and red poppies, whose flowers bloom in summer. These colors then became representative of the contrada. =Legnarello= right It is located in the area beyond the strada statale del Sempione, to the north-east of the city. Legnarello's colors and banner are linked to a legend and a historical fact. Both explanations can be traced back to the Spanish rule over the Duchy of Milan, during which Legnanello became a noble quarter inhabited by Spanish nobles. Red and yellow, in addition to the colors of Legnarello, are also the Spanish national colors. The legend tells that the hidalgo don Pedro de Torquemada, living in Legnarello, used to wear half-red and half- yellow clothes in combat. Despite the high visibility of the garments, his enemies never managed to hit him and so the Spanish nobleman decided to hoist a red flag with a yellow sun on his house, symbols that were then taken over by the Legnarello contrada. The historical fact is instead connected to Donna Consuelo of the Melzi D'Eril; the Spanish noblewoman died of plague in 1621, and as a legacy she established that in her home in Legnanello the yellow-red banners of the governor of C√≥rdoba, Spain, should have been kept. These signs then became the symbol of the Contrada Legnarello. =San Bernardino= right Located in the area \\"Oltre Stazione\\" (that is to the west of the Domodossola- Milan railway), to the south-west of the city, it is one of the largest contrade. There are two legends that explain the colors of the contrada. The first tells of a master-at-arms who wanted to sentence a girl to death for rejecting his love. This master-at-arms would have pardoned the young woman only if the bells of the little church of San Bernardino had resonated without human intervention. Immediately after the first swing shaken by the aggressor, the bells began to ring by themselves and this attracted the attention of some passing knights, who intervened by rescuing the girl. The second legend tells instead of an aggression suffered by a girl in the countryside of the contrada by a bear. At his request for help, the inhabitants made the bells of the church of San Bernardino ring. Their sound was heard by some passing knights, who saved the young woman. In both legends the tunics of the girls soiled by blood became the flag of the contrada, where the white of the dress indicates the purity of the girl, while the red of the blood her regality of mind. The contrada proposes in its banner, in addition to the white and red colors, the reference to a radiant eight-pointed sun and a trigram with Gothic characters bearing the writing (Latin abbreviation corresponding to \\"Noster Bernardinus Sanctus\\"; in English it is translated as \\"our saint Bernardino\\"). This coat of arms is connected to the tablet that St. Bernardino presented to believers after his homilies. =San Domenico= right It is the only contrada that does not border on any other municipality, and it is the historical contrada that won the first edition of the Palio (1935). There are two legends that explain the colors of the contrada. The first tells of a dog that found two tibiae in the fields of the contrada that belonged to warriors who had died in the battle of Legnano. The dog, after giving the bones to the inhabitants of the contrada, went with them, with a torch lit in the mouth, to a place where they could be buried honorably. Wanting to tie the colors of the contrada to this legend, the green symbolizes the shade of the fields, while the white the bones of the soldiers perished in the battle. Another legend tells that once, in Legnano, there were two convents. These monasteries, at a certain point, merged into a single religious institute. The two convents were connected by a secret tunnel that was haunted by a ghost. This ghost, during the night, scares the inhabitants of the neighborhood with infernal noises caused by the creeping of its chains. The guardian father of the monastery, Fra' Bonino, decided to remedy the problem by awaiting the ghost at one of the two entrances to the tunnel. At a certain point, during the night, the ghost appeared, which explained to the friar that he was the Germanic soldier Rudolf Himmer, who was left buried by the battle of Legnano. The ghost told the friar that he would no longer disturb the sleep of the inhabitants of the neighborhood if the friar had given a proper burial to his bones, which were scattered in the tunnel. The friar granted the wish of the ghost but, not remembering the soldier's name, he placed on his grave a green flag and two white bones. This composition then became the emblem of the Contrada San Domenico. The symbol of the contrada, that is a dog with a torch in its mouth, as well as being connected to the first narrated legend, also has a religious explanation: it derives from the order of the Dominicans, who were called the \\"greyhounds of the Lord\\", that is to say the bearers of the light of faith. =San Magno= right It is located in the central-southern area of the city. The most famous and well-known legend, among those that narrate the origin of the colors of the contrada, tells that an Austrian oak was erected long ago in today's Piazza San Magno. On the day of the patron saint, on November 5, a farmer began to contemplate the tree admiring its ability to withstand frost and snow. Thus the peasant expressed the desire to be able to resist life's difficulties in the same way. At that moment Saint Magnus appeared, who offered to satisfy man's desire by giving him the strength, the recklessness and the power of a lion. The Saint ordered the farmer to kill a rabbit and advance on the ground, covered in snow, where the animal's blood had been spilled. The farmer carried out the orders and then Saint Magnus granted his dream turning it into a lion. Once the prodigy was completed, the Saint suddenly disappeared without satisfying the farmer who asked him to return as a man, thus punishing his pride. The white of the snow and the red of the blood of the rabbit became the symbol of the contrada. These colors, the tree and the lion were also included in the coat of arms and gonfalon of the city of Legnano. According to another legend, white and red are associated with the blood left on the snow by saints Sebastian and Roch, who had gone to Legnano to contemplate the frescoes in the basilica of San Magno. In the emblem of the contrada there is, above the red field on the left, the miter of Saint Magnus. In the center, above the white color, are depicted his episcopal umbrella and his provostural keys, while his crosier is represented above the red field on the right. =San Martino= right It is located in the north-central area of the city, towards the border with the municipalities of Castellanza and Busto Arsizio. There are two legends that explain the colors of the contrada. The first tells of a noble vassal of Charlemagne who was lost in the fields of San Martino while he was training with horses. The vassal, at a certain point, met a woodsman, to whom he asked the way to follow to find his way home; the woodcutter, after having indicated a cross-shaped cloud formation, told him that if he followed it he would find the right direction. The nobleman, to thank him, allowed the woodcutter to use the white cross in a blue field as a symbol of his family: subsequently the vassal had the emperor's ratification ratified. The white cross on a blue field then became the symbol of the contrada. A second legend tells of a young shepherd who lost himself in the countryside around the ancient church of San Martino, later replaced by the homonymous religious building. The little shepherd, not finding his way home, at one point began to cry and pleaded with God asking him for help. Suddenly a luminous cross appeared in the sky that showed him the way back home. According to these legends the blue of the emblem of the contrada is associated with the sky, while white is the divine color. The banner instead recalls the religious iconography of Saint Martin, who shows the saint in the act of cutting his cloak to give it to a poor man. =Sant'Ambrogio= right It is located in the central-southern area of the city. The colors of the contrada are explained by a legend and by a historical fact that actually happened. Legend has it that once a year, in a February night, a yellow- skinned demon used to wander the streets of the neighborhood dressed in an old greenish tunic, with the intention of going to the church of Sant'Ambrogio to carry out thefts. The raids lasted until the pastor, tired of these disappearances, put a rosary crown in the lock of the entrance door: in this way the demon found his keys blocked and put his fingers to free the hole, but touching the sacred object deflated and died, leaving its yellowish skin and its green cloak on the churchyard. The following morning the faithful, going to church, found these remains and adopted these colors as symbols of the contrada. Another explanation, this time of an historical nature, comes from the discovery of the body of the Archbishop of Milan Leone da Perego, who died in Legnano in 1257 in the homonymous palace,D'Ilario, 1984, p. 211. under the portico of the church of Sant'Ambrogio; this finding occurred in 1650 during the enlargement of the religious building.D'Ilario, 1984, p. 237. According to two mediaeval chroniclers, the body of Leone da Perego was buried in the church of San Salvatore in Legnano.Ferrarini, p. 56. Still according to the accounts of Agostino Pozzo, to find his treasure, which was believed buried in the church of Sant'Ambrogio and which was said to be composed of gold and bronze objects, he continued to dig, but in vain. After his discovery, the body of Leone da Perego disappeared without leaving a trace. Considering the historical event linked to the discovery of the archbishop's body, the meaning of yellow and green is connected, respectively, to the gold and bronze of the treasure of Leone da Perego. On the banner of the contrada is instead depicted the staff of St. Ambrose. =Sant'Erasmo= right It is situated to the south- east and borders with the municipalities of San Vittore Olona and Cerro Maggiore. The crow, symbol of the contrada, originates from a legend linked to the Legnanese ancient convent of Santa Caterina and located chronologically just before the battle of Legnano, around the year 1000.Autori vari, p. 173. It is said that from this monastery, at some point, food began to disappear, and therefore the abbot, Bernardo Paletta, decided to establish a guard service to control the pantry. The following morning the friar on guard, Fra' Camillo, saw a crow in the window come in such a black and shiny plumage that it looked bluish. The animal, at one point, stole bread and cheese from the pantry, and flew out the window. The friars followed the crow and saw the animal heading towards a group of three elders who were grouped around a white tablecloth. At this point the animal came down from the three and gave them food. To thank God for the miracle, the friars decided to build a shelter, the aforementioned St. Erasmus hospice. This shelter building was later dedicated to Saint Erasmus because near the place where the elders consumed the meal there was a small chapel dedicated to this saint. For this reason the blue of the emblem of the contrada symbolizes heaven and charity, while white love and wisdom. The banner instead recalls the crow, its bluish plumage and the white tablecloth of the three elders.

L. Gallot (born January 29, 1948 in Bazoches-l√®s-Bray) is a French mathematician, specializing in differential geometry. He is an emeritus professor at the Institut Fourier of the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, in the Geometry and Topology section. Education and career Sylvestre Gallot received his doctorate from Paris Diderot University (Paris 7) with thesis under the direction of Marcel Berger. Gallot worked during the early 1980s at the University of Savoie, then at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure de Lyon and the University of Grenoble (Institut Fourier). His research deals with isoperimetric inequalities in Riemann geometry, rigidity issues, and the Laplace operator spectrum on Riemannian manifolds. With G√©rard Besson and Pierre B√©rard, he discovered, in 1985, a form of isoperimetric inequality in Riemannian manifolds with a lower bound involving the diameter and Ricci curvature. (pbk reprint of 2003 original) In 1995, he discovered with G√©rard Besson and Gilles Courtois, a Chebyshev inequality for the minimal entropy of locally symmetrical spaces of negative curvature; the inequality gives a new and simpler proof of the Mostow rigidity theorem. The result of Besson, Courtois, and Gallo is called minimal entropy rigidity. In 1998 he was an invited speaker with talk Curvature decreasing maps are volume decreasing at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.

Geography  Map of Achkhoy-Martanovsky District with Zakan-Yurt highlighted Zakan-Yurt is located on the southern slope of the Sunzhensky Ridge, opposite from the confluence of the Assa River into the Sunzha River. It is located north-east of the town of Achkhoy-Martan and south-west of the city of Grozny. The nearest settlements to Zakan-Yurt are Alkhan-Kala in the east, Khambi-Irze in the south-east, Shaami-Yurt in the south-west, and Samashki in the north- west.  History  The village was first founded in 1851 or 1853, according to different sources, with the name of Zakan-Yurtovskaya (from 1913-1924 - called Romanovskaya) as a part of the Sunzhensky Cossack line. Later, on Order number 01721, the entire Cossack population of the village was evicted. The empty village was then handed to Chechen control. It was populated by Chechens and renamed to Zakan-Yurt at this time. In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Zakan-Yurt was renamed to Prigorodnoye, and settled by people from other ethnic groups. From 1944 to 1957, it was a part of the Novoselsky District of Grozny Oblast. In 1958, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old name, Zaki-Evla. On 1 January 2020, the territory of the Samashki Forestry was transferred from Samashki to Zakan-Yurt, and became known as Zakan-Yurt Forestry.  Population  * 1990 Census: 5,093 * 2002 Census: 4,928 * 2010 Census: 5,835 * 2019 estimate: 6,713 According to the results of the 2010 Census, the majority of residents of Zakan-Yurt were ethnic Chechens.  Infrastructure  Zakan-Yurt hosts two secondary schools, a kindergarten, and a state farm.

He was the commander of torpedo bombers in the Attack on Pearl Harbor that crippled several United States Navy (USN) battleships, and during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands that resulted in sinking of carrier Hornet. He was killed in action during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Early career Shigeharu Murata entered Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in April 1927 and graduated from 58th class in November 1930. In April 1932, he completed a navy pilot training program at Kasumigaura Training Naval Air Station (NAS) and was commissioned as Ensign. He was promoted to Lieutenant Junior Grade in November 1933. In July 1934, he was assigned to Tateyama (NAS) and in October 1935 to carrier Kaga . In October 1936, he served as an instructor at Kasumigaura Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near Tokyo and was promoted to full Lieutenant in December. In 1937, he was transferred to 13th Air Group and flew Yokosuka B4Y bomber. He participated in early stages of Second Sino-Japanese War and was also involved in USS Panay incident in 12 December 1937. In March 1938, Lieutenant Murata was transferred to 12th Air Group and assigned as one of the flight division leaders (buntaich≈ç). There he participated in strikes on Hankou in Central China. In December, he was transferred to carrier Akagi and became flight division leader (buntaich≈ç) in torpedo bomber squadron. In June 1939, he was assigned to Usa NAS in ≈åita Prefecture on Kyushu and in October he began an advanced training course for torpedo attack specialization at Yokosuka NAS. In November 1940, he was appointed as an instructor at the same NAS and conducted research on torpedo attack technique in shallow waters. Pacific War In September 1941, Lieutenant Murata was transferred back to Akagi. He was assigned as torpedo squadron leader (as hik≈çtaich≈ç) and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. He participated in the Attack on Pearl Harbor, where he commanded the torpedo bombers that crippled Battleship Row. After that, he participated in the Indian Ocean Raid and subsequently in the Battle of Midway. He was on board Akagi when the bomb released by Lieutenant Dick Best hit the carrier and set it afire. In July 1942, Lieutenant Commander Murata was transferred to the carrier Sh≈çkaku and was assigned as its torpedo bomber squadron leader (as hik≈çtaich≈ç). In late August 1942, he participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, however he did not see any action. For this battle, Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo had decided to hold the Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers in reserve, while allocating two waves of Aichi D3A dive bombers to soften up the enemy fleet beforehand. The dive bomber strikes, under Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki (Sh≈çkaku) and Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi (Zuikaku) respectively, were launched late in the afternoon, leaving little possibility of launching the torpedo bombers. In late October 1942, Lieutenant Commander Murata participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, where he commanded the first strike wave that consisted of 21 D3A dive bombers, 20 B5N torpedo bombers and 21 A6M Zero fighters. The dive bombers were led by Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi from Zuikaku, while four escorting Sh≈çkaku fighters were led by Lieutenant Hisayoshi Miyajima, eight from Zuikaku by Lieutenant Ayao Shirane and nine from Zuih≈ç by Lieutenant Moriyasu Hidaka. One the way, the IJN strike force encountered a USN strike force on a reciprocal course. At that point, Lieutenant Hidaka and his nine Zeros abandoned the escort duty and attacked the USN aircraft. When the rest of the strike force approached the USN fleet, Murata led an extremely well-coordinated torpedo and dive-bombing attack that achieved three bomb and two torpedo hits on carrier Hornet. The torpedo released by Murata appeared to have been among the two that hit the carrier. However, during the attack Murata's B5N was hit by anti-aircraft artillery and went down in flames. He was one of the many experienced carrier pilots lost in the battle; these included his academy classmate, Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki, who led the second wave strike that severely damaged Enterprise. He was posthumously promoted by two ranks to Captain and received a special individual citation from the IJN. Portrayal in media Shigeharu Murata appeared in the 1970 film Tora! Tora! Tora! and was portrayed by Japanese actor Toshio Hosokawa (Á¥∞Â∑ù ‰øäÂ§´).

He was then sent to London to learn lithography with \\"Day & Son\\". In London he met John Phillip who helped develop his style. However, Gibb lacked confidence in his own skills and remained firmly of the belief that he should only pursue commissioned works, rather than risk speculative work. These commissions often linked to entire series to illustrate a reference book. His clients included Sir David Cameron and Sir John Reid. He specialised in creating lithographs of whole collections of relics, artefacts etc. and was in demand as an accurate draughtsman. His works are found in most British galleries and museums and in the homes of many of the landed gentry.

Yerkes 41-inch reflector is a 40-inch aperture (101.6 cm) reflecting telescope at the Yerkes Observatory, that was completed in 1968. It is known as the 41 inch to avoid confusion with a 40 inch refractor at the observatory. Optically it is a Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien design, and the main mirror uses low expansion glass. The telescope was used as a testbed for an adaptive optics system in the 1990s. History In the late 1960s a 40-inch reflecting telescope was added, often called the \\"41 inch\\" reflector, and in 2002 it was given a new dome over it. The 41 inch was finished by 1968, with overall installation completed by December 1967 and the optics in 1968. The telescope had a clear aperture of 40 inches, but was often called the \\"41 inch\\" so it would not be confused with the Yerkes 40 inch refractor. Also, the physical diameter of the mirror was 41 inches, even though optical clear aperture was smaller. The 40 inch reflector was of the Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien optical design. It systems and the figuring of the glass was mostly completed at the Optical workshop of the Yerkes Observatory. However, the mirror was completed by Tinsley Laboratories, because the person (A graduate student) working on the mirror died unexpectedly. The mirror had a physical diameter of 104 cm and was made from Cer-Vit low-expansion glass. In the 21st century, the 41 inch was placed on the robotic Skynet telescope network, along with a 24-inch telescope at Yerkes. The telescope is one of three major instruments at the Observatory in the late 20th and 21st century, along with 40-inch refractor and 24-inch reflector; these three telescopes occupy the 3 main telescope domes of the building. The 41 inch was installed in the southern dome, replacing the old 24-inch (2 foot ) reflecting telescope that dated to the turn of the century. The northern dome housed the new 24 inch, which replaced the Kenwood 12-inch refractor. Both of these domes are on the eastern side of the building along with the meridian transit room. The south-east dome has a diameter of about 30 feet, and was originally designed for 14-inch refractor in the 1890s. Instruments The launch instruments for the 41 inch reflector included: * Image tube spectrograph * photoelectric photometer * photoelectric spectrophotometer The telescope was often used as a testbed for a device known as the Wavefront Control Experiment in the 1990s. This was an adaptive optics system that used a deformable mirror to reduce the blurring caused by disturbances in the atmosphere of Earth. One application was the study of combining adoptive optics with fiber optics for high-accuracy spectrographs. That type of data, given enough accuracy can be used to detect exoplanets by doppler shift.

They play an important role in drinking water infrastructure by allowing the prediction of algal blooms which can block filters and affect the taste of the water.  Purpose  Limnological towers provide a fixed structure to which sensors and sampling devices can be affixed. The depth of the structure below water level allows for study of the various layers of water in the lake or reservoir. The management of limnological conditions can be important in reservoirs used to supply drinking water treatment plants. In certain conditions algal blooms can occur which can block filters, change the pH of the water and cause taste and odour problems. If the sensors extend to the bed level the tower can also be used to monitor the hypolimnion (lowest layer of water) which in some conditions can become anoxic (of low oxygen content) which may affect the lake ecology. Limnological towers have been constructed in reservoirs used to supply drinking water in the United Kingdom since algal blooms began causing problems with water quality. By providing data on water conditions and algae levels the towers can predict the behaviour of the algae and allow managers to make decisions to alter conditions to prevent algal blooms. These decisions may include altering water inflows (particularly where nutrient-rich intakes are considered), activating water jets to promote the mixing of different layers of water and altering the depth from which water is abstracted. These decisions can affect the behaviour of the reservoir over a period from a few hours to a few years.  Examples  =North America= Six combined limnological and meteorological observation towers were established in the Great Lakes on the US-Canadian border in 1961. Three were installed in Lake Huron, two in Lake Ontario and one in Lake Erie by the Great Lakes Institute. These were innovative in design and cheap to construct, being built largely from water pipe. Constructed in water depths of the towers provided measurements of wind speed, air temperature and rainfall as well as water temperature and current flows at different depth. The shorter towers (in water less than of depth) were attached directly to the bed, towers in greater depths of water were floating units, with a submerged ballast tank, that were anchored to the lake bed by means of cables and weights. A further two limnological towers were constructed near Douglas Point in Lake Huron in the 1960s. One, high was built offshore in 1961 and a second high in 1969. They are poles anchored to the lake bed by means of a gimbal and braced by tensioned cables and anchor guys. They featured a mobile thermistor sensor that could be moved to any depth on the tower as well as fixed thermometers at various depths and were intended to montor the temperatures of different water layers in the lake. =United Kingdom = A concrete limnological tower was installed at Rutland Water, England's largest reservoir by surface area, when it was built in the early 1970s. The design of the tower was influenced by consultation with the Water Research Centre and was intended to provide the best possible tools to monitor the ecological conditions of the reservoir so that it could be best managed by its operator (the Anglian Water Authority). The tower monitors water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels and water fluorescence (which is a measure of algal content) at 2m depth intervals. The tower also has the ability to draw water samples for further testing from the various depths and also mounts an automatic weather station. The data is continuous and displayed visually in real-time at the reservoir control centre, situated at the dam. The site of the tower was chosen to best suit the needs of the operator. The reservoir consists of two arms ‚Äì northern and southern ‚Äì and has been designed such that all nutrient-rich water enters the southern arm. The intention being that nutrients will be depleted before the water is abstracted for use at the eastern end of the site. The northern-arm is fed by nutrient-poor sources and should be relatively unaffected by algal blooms. A secondary outlet is available that draws solely from the northern arm, in cases that the southern arm is affected by algal growth. Additionally the operators are able to draw directly from the River Nene if the reservoir water is unusable. The Queen Mother Reservoir near London also has a limnological tower.

Main =Bortronians= Jet Propulsion Jet Propulsion (voiced by Ashleigh Ball) is the title character of the show and is a humanoid alien. He has red hair and can stretch his body, as his parents can. He is excitable, energetic, and goofy. He is tall for his age. Jet is 63 years old in Bortronian years, as revealed in \\"Earthday Birthday\\". He was instantly popular with the other children the moment he arrived on Earth. He sees the mundane world as a vast and exciting place, and even thinks that words are exciting, such as \\"surprise\\", claiming it to be a funny Earth word. He is named after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is shown to be extremely kind, even to people who are mean to him, such as Mitchell. He possibly likes Sydney, because he danced with her in \\"How Come the Moon Changes Shape?\\", and is shown to possibly like Sean in \\"Back to Bortron 7\\". Sunspot Sunspot Propulsion is the Propulsion family pet. He is described as a dog or cat to \\"Earthies\\" not in the know. Sunspot has the ears of a rabbit, the body of a kangaroo, and the tail of a raccoon or a fox. He plays concertina, electric guitar, bugle, pan pipes, and drums. Sunspot is silly and likes to play. His status as a mere \\"pet\\" may be somewhat of a put-on: He knows how to read, can talk and sing, and can follow conversations, but often seems confused about what behaviors are expected from a pet. He often functions as a deus ex machina, figuring out what is going on and what needs to be done and then conveying that information to one or more of the children. Carrot and Jet both realize there's more to Sunspot than the obvious, as evidenced by a conversation in \\"The Greatest Canyon\\": Carrot: \\"You ever get the idea there's something he's not telling us?\\" Jet: \\"All the time, Dad. All the time.\\" In \\"Back to Bortron 7\\", a large Sunspot-like character is shown to be Carrot and Celery's boss, meaning the species is equal among the Bortronians. Carrot Carrot Propulsion (voiced by Kyle Rideout) is Jet's father. His name from his home planet includes the sound of an elephant trumpeting and a parrot squawking. He tends to be goofy, like Jet. He often stays home while Celery takes the kids on adventures into outer space, as he doesn't really like going in the flying saucer. Carrot often cooks wacky dishes such as deep- fried lollipops. Celery Celery Propulsion (voiced by Meg Roe) is Jet's mother. Celery is smart and often takes the kids to space. Her name from her home planet includes the sounds of banging, buzzing, and clanging. She normally drives the family vehicle, as Carrot's driving makes her nervous. She likes racing against her brother, Zucchini. Face 9000 Face 9000 (voiced by Brian Drummond) is a computer. He is a cyan face with blue facial features projected from a small, round ball. He has a younger brother, Face 9001. Face 9000 knows everything about science, and often pops up to answer the kids' science questions. In \\"Face on the Fritz\\", he gets an upgrade. He has a tendency to get jealous easily. =Earthies= Collective name for Earth natives used by the Bortronians. Sydney Sydney Skelley (voiced by Dalila Bela (season 1), Vienna Leacock (in Back to Bortron 7-season 2-present)) is a girl with black hair and green eyes. She idolizes a character named Commander Cressida, named after the moon of Uranus, who has a dog named Sirius, named after the brightest star in Earth's night sky. Sydney is imaginative and very friendly, often acting as the voice of reason for the kids. In \\"How Come the Moon Changes Shape?\\" she danced with Jet, in \\"Kid Kart Derby\\" she hugged him. Her mother is Dr. Amy Skelley. Sydney's motto is \\"A kid's place is exploring space.\\" Her friendship with the Propulsion family gives her many opportunities to do just that, which makes her a happy girl. She is named after Sydney, Australia. Sean Sean Rafferty (voiced by William Ainscough (seasons 1-Our Sun is a Star!), Grady Ainscough (in You Can Call Me Albedo-Moon Face), Glen Gordon (in Lone Star 2 - Rocket Kids!-present)) is a boy with light brown hair, gray eyes, and freckles. Sean probably has asthma; he is shown breathing into a brown paper bag in \\"Jet Cooks Dinner\\", and he mentions once when the children are in space that sometimes he has trouble breathing. He is smart and wants to be an astronaut when he grows up, but he has slight claustrophobia. Sean likes to follow the Scientific Method, as shown in many episodes; he even has his own song about it. His mother is Dr. Rafferty. Sean idolizes Neil Armstrong, and has his action figure, which he takes along on their space trips. Mindy Mindy Melendez (voiced by Jaeda Lily Miller) is a 5-year-old girl (she was previously four, but turned five in episode \\"Mindy Turns Five\\") with brown eyes, dark brown hair in two pigtails, and a hat that looks like a teddy-bear face. Until recently she stayed on Earth when the others go into outer space; she was not allowed to go any further than Jet's backyard. She is now allowed to travel past Jet's backyard, as she is now five, so she now accompanies the others as they travel into space. Mindy is the most normal, average, and bland of the main cast. She is the only one who knows Mitchell is spying on Jet and is out to expose him. Supporting =Bortronians= Zucchini Zucchini (voiced by Ian James Corlett) is Jet's maternal uncle and Celery's brother. He is a garbage collector on Bortron and works for the East Galaxy Garbage Company, Bortron 7 Division, using the Big Bortronian Junk Sucker (BBJS).. He is very kind to the kids, but also dimwitted at times. Moonbeam Moonbeam is the pet of Uncle Zucchini. She looks similar to Sunspot, but Moonbeam is blue and plays electric guitar (left-handed). Eggplant Eggplant (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain) is Jet's aunt, Zucchini's wife, and Zerk's mom. She is an intergalactic travel writer just like Carrot and Celery. Zerk Zerk (voiced by Meg Roe) is Jet's cousin. He calls Jet to ask when the first Earthie visited Bortron. He visits Earth in \\"Zerk Visits Earth.\\" Zerk is very energetic and hyperactive. In \\"Whole Lotta Shakin'\\" and \\"Asteroid Belt Space Race\\", he is shown to be very competitive. Spinach Spinach is Celery's cousin. Celery calls him when the van/flying saucer is not working and she needs advice. =Earthies= Mitchell Peterson Mitchell Peterson (voiced by Spencer Drever (season 1), David Raynolds (season 2), Dylan Schombing (One Small Step)) looks similar to Sean except that he wears glasses and a hat. Along with Mindy, he is younger than Jet, Sean, and Sydney. For his age, he appears to be smarter than Mindy, even knowing about and building an exact replica of the Saturn V rocket. Mitchell has a tendency to be sarcastic and sometimes blunt. He always wants to expose Jet's alien identity but inevitably fails. Nonetheless, Jet is nice to him. In \\"Holidays in Boxwood Terrace\\" it is revealed that he only pretends to be mean and he is really shy and wants to be friends with Jet, Sean, Sydney, and Mindy, but he doesn't know how to do it. In the end, the kids welcome him into their group. His grandfather was a farmer, which he mentions in \\"Eye in the Sky.\\" Mr. Peterson Mr. Peterson is Mitchell's dad (voiced by Ian James Corlett) and addresses other people by their last names, calling Mitchell \\"Peterson\\" and using \\"Propulsion\\" to refer to Jet and Carrot. In the episode \\"Mindy's Weather Report\\" he calls himself the self- appointed safety officer for the neighborhood. He, like his son, can be a bit full of himself. He is an expert at playing mini-golf. He is also a big soccer fan. Dr. Rafferty Dr. Rafferty (voiced by Keegan Connor Tracy) is Sean's scientist mother. She and her co-worker Berg appear in \\"Visit to Mom's Office.\\" She helps Mindy identify a meteorite in \\"Mindy's Meteorite Stand.\\" Dr. Rafferty is patient, smart, and loving. In \\"Visit to Mom's Office\\", she mentions that she felt like an alien when she was a kid. Dr. Berg Dr. Berg (voiced by Brian Drummond) is a man who works with Dr. Rafferty. They later appear as judges for the baking competition. Dr. Berg can be rather silly at times. He loves drinking coffee and always has it in his hand. Sunspot always steals his watch. Dr. Melendez Dr. Melendez (voiced by Meg Roe) is Mindy's mother. She is heard calling to Mindy in \\"More Than One Moon.\\" Riley Riley is a kid in Sean, Sydney, and Mindy's school. He brought in his favorite snow globe for show and tell.. He is not shown. Lillian Lillian (voiced by Amelia Shoichet Stoll) is a friend of Mindy's. The two girls dig a small \\"Grand Canyon\\" in a sandbox while the Propulsions and the other children visit Valles Marineris on Mars.. Lillian is a girly girl but isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. She can be quite forgetful, seeing as how she told Mindy what her \\"surprise\\" present was. =Lillian's mom= Lillian's mom (voiced by Ashleigh Ball) is heard in \\"Mindy Turns 5\\", when she calls Lillian because she has to go to class. Beep Beep is a robot who lives at the Deep Space Array (DSA). She has a twin sister, Boop, who is a Rover on Mars. Dr. Skelley Dr. Skelley (voiced by Brenda Crichlow) is Sydney's mom, who also works at the DSA. Like her daughter, she is also a fan of Commander Cressida. She is a robotics engineer.

Architect Samuel Atwater Treat gave the building a Late Classical Revival design with Georgian Revival features. In its first decades, the Forum hosted speeches and rallies from politicians of all major parties and various community events. Following the Great Migration of the 1920s, Bronzeville became a predominantly African-American neighborhood, but the Forum continued to serve as a community center. Several civil rights organizations met in the Forum, including the National Negro Congress' Chicago council; the Chicago Scottsboro Defense Conference, a group organized to defend the Scottsboro Boys; movements that petitioned to racially integrate Major League Baseball; and a meeting of the Freedom Riders. The Forum was also a major jazz venue, and Chicago musicians such as Nat King Cole and Tiny Parham played the venue often. In the 1940s, the building became the headquarters of the Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World, a black fraternal organization formed in response to the white-only Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.

Early life Johnston was born on 3 January 1724 at Perth Amboy in the Province of New Jersey, which was then a part of British America. He was the second son of John Johnston Jr., a major in the British Army, and the former Elizabeth Jamison. His elder elder brother, John Johnston, married their cousin, Euphemia Johnston (daughter of Andrew Johnston), and was Colonel of the New Jersey Provincial troops at the capture of Fort Niagara during the French and Indian War in 1758. His paternal grandparents were Eupham (n√©e Scot) Johnston (only daughter of George Scot, Laird of Pitlochie) and Dr. John Johnstone of Edinburgh, who emigrated to the United States in 1685 and served as Mayor of New York City from 1714 to 1718. Through his father, he was a member of the Border Reiver Scottish clan Johnstone and, reportedly, in \\"middle life he was called upon to receive the title and estate of Marquis of Annandale,\\" a title in the Peerage of Scotland, \\"but declined on the ground that he was an American and unwilling to give up his birthright for a life in England, but later, at the coming of age of his eldest son, regretted his refusal.\\" His maternal grandfather, David Jamison, was one of the so-called Nine Partners who purchased a large tract of land in the Province of New York in 1697. Jamison served as Secretary of the State of the Colony of New York, Warden of Trinity Church, Chief Justice of the Colony of New Jersey in 1711, and Attorney General of the Colony of New York in 1720. Career At a young age, he entered business as a wine merchant, trading directly with the Netherlands using his own ship. He worked as a merchant until the death of his mother when he inherited his share of the Nine Partners Tract, which by then was worth a substantial amount, and required his considerable attention as his land and estates were extensive. By 1800, Johnston owned 15 slaves at his estate in the Hudson Valley. =Political career= In February 1761, he was elected to the New York General Assembly and was registered a Freeman of the City on 21 August 1770 as \\"David Johnston, Gentleman.\\" On 19 May 1774, he was chosen as one of the Committee of Correspondence, and \\"subsequently chosen as one of a Committee of Observation elected by a poll held at the City Hall by order of the Committee of Correspondence. He was also one of a Committee of One Hundred selected at the agitation to the War of Independence.\\" On 26 April 1775, he was one of the signers of a call for a New York Provincial Congress. Personal life On 27 May 1753, Johnston was married to Magdalen Walton. Magdalen was a daughter of William Walton and Mary (n√©e Beekman) Walton (a daughter of Dr. Gerardus Beekman, acting Governor of the Province of New York). Magdalen's sister Mary Walton was the wife of Lewis Morris, signer of the Declaration of Independence. In New York City, he had a mansion on the east side of Bowling Green (which was burned during the Revolutionary War), a farm in Greenwich Village, a farm in Perth Amboy (which was burned by the Hessians when the British Army occupied New Jersey), and in the Hudson Valley, he owned a large country estate and residence known as Annandale in Lithgow (a hamlet within Washington, New York Johnston named after Linlithgow, the ancestral home of his maternal grandfather) where he permanently moved to after the War. Together, they were the parents of three sons and seven daughters, including: * Mary Johnston (b. 1754), who married John Allen (d. 1778), son of William Allen (Chief Justice of the Province of Pennsylvania and mayor of Philadelphia), in 1775. * Elizabeth Johnston (b. 1755), who married Capt.

This technology came about thanks to major advances in electric propulsion (motors, batteries, electronic controllers) and the growing need for new vehicles for urban air mobility (air taxi). Examples are in development by companies such as Boeing, NASA, and Airbus. History The concept of eVTOL aircraft emerged in 2011 through the AugustaWestland Project Zero (USA), the Volocopter VC1 (Germany) and the Opener BlackFly (USA) . It was officially introduced by AHS Internationnal and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) in 2014 during the \\"Transformative Vertical Flight Concepts Joint Workshop on Enabling New Flight Concepts through Novel Propulsion and Energy Architectures\\" held in Virgina (USA). Since then, there has been a real craze among aircraft manufacturers for eVTOLs, and companies such as Boeing, Airbus and Bell have taken over the market : * Airbus Vahana introduced in 2017 at the Paris Air Show, first flight in January 2018 * Boeing - Aurora Flight Sciences PAV, in development since 2017, first flight in 2019 * Bell Nexus 6HX unveiled at the CES 2019 But in addition to these major aircraft manufacturers, startups have been playing an important role in the development of these air vehicles and had sometimes been leaders in technological advances.  Uses  = Civil use= Most of the civil eVTOL aircraft are designed for urban air mobility, their typical roles are :  Air Taxi  Volocopter 2X Many eVTOL's concept are for Air Taxi application. For instance, Pipistrel an Uber Elevate partner, is working on the Pipistrel 801, a 5 seats air taxi. Another example is Volocopter, which proposed its air taxi service called VoloCity, based on the Volocopter 2X .  Medical assistance (EMS)  In 2020, JumpAero announced to be working on a small eVTOL aircraft (1 seat) to allow the rapid deployment of emergency services in the event of an accident. This type of vehicle is not a replacement for land vehicles or helicopters, but a new tool that, thanks to the electric drive, is faster than the others. In 2020, the Canadian Air Mobility consortium studied the benefits of eVTOL for direct hospital-to-hospital transportation of patients, organs and drugs.  Personal use  Personal eVTOL aircraft have been created to introduce electric flight into recreational aviation. This is what Neva Aerospace has done with the AirQuad One concept, a single-seat flying quad vehicle. A Japanese company called skydrive unveiled a prototype for a personal eVTOL aircraft in 2020. Boeing also sponsored a $1 million contest called GoFly to design and build a personal eVTOL aircraft. =Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) = Unmanned Multicopter were the first aerial vehicle to appear in the eVTOL category. First used for R&D; purposes, they are now considered as full-fledged aircraft.  Delivery use  The Google-owned company Alphabet has been offering an eVTOL UAV delivery service since 2020. Their drones are able to fly up to 100km and carry up to 1.5kg. Amazon AIr and UPS are two others companies using drone delivery . A german aerospace company called Wingcopter in collaboration with UNICEF has also delivered vaccines in Vanuatu in 2018. In 2020 wingcopter eVTOL drone was used to deliver COVID-19 test kits to Isle of Mull.Wingcopter 178 HL on a 255x255px = Military use = In April 2020, the USAF announced $25 million-worth funding of eVTOL projects for development in 2021. On August 20, 2020, United States Air Force (USAF) held a demonstration flight of an electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft at Camp Mabry in Austin, Texas. It was the first time that a manned eVTOL aircraft took flight under USAF Agility Prime programme.  Certification  = Europe = Since 2018, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has been working on the certification of such aircraft. In July 2019, they published the SC-VTOL-01 : Special Condition for VTOL aircraft. This document established the safety and design objectives for VTOL aircraft. It includes a special section for eVTOL. = USA = The Certification of Small aircraft (Part 23 - FAA certification) is in force. In particular Part 23-Amendment 64 include eVTOL.

History St James was built to replace an earlier church of Saxon origin that had been rebuilt in the early 18th-century. Owing to its dilapidated condition, the church was demolished in April 1845 to make way for a new, larger one designed by Thomas Henry Wyatt of London. The new St James was consecrated by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Richard Bagot, on 18 August 1846. The church's spire suffered bomb damage during World War II and the church had to temporarily close in 1946 following further damage from gales. Repairs allowed the church to reopen on 9 February 1947. The church closed in 1958 and was declared redundant by the Church Commissioners in 1971. It was subsequently sold to a private owner and planning was approved for a conversion scheme in 1975. Another conversion scheme for the former church was approved in 1988. Architecture St James is built of Doulting freestone, with slate roofs, in the Early Decorated style. It is made up of a five-bay nave, chancel, south transept, north vestry, and south tower, with porch underneath and broach spire above. The church was designed to seat 130 persons. Many of the church's original fittings were carved from oak, including the open hammer-beam roof, open sittings, communion table, reading desk and pulpit.

As with any antiquities dealers in this period, Mohassib frequently sold items stolen from \\"inadequately supervised excavations\\" around Luxor, and Davis and Andrews were reasonably certain they regularly bought back items from their own sites. Because of this, it is difficult to ascertain the provenance of many items coming from his shop. Upon his death on April 6, 1928, in Luxor, Percy Newberry memorialized him in the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology. Further reading # E. A.

The saga tells the story of a chastity-testing cloak brought to the court of King Arthur. It was translated, along with other chivalric sagas, under the patronage of Haakon IV of Norway. Its risqu√© content suggests that it was translated by clerks rather than in a religious context. M√∂ttuls saga formed the basis for a later set of Icelandic r√≠mur called Skikkjur√≠mur. Complete texts of the saga date from the 17th century. However, there are indications that M√∂ttuls saga may have been one of the earliest Arthurian texts translated into Old Norse. The saga begins with an extended introductory section, not present in the French text, that describes King Arthur. Such an introduction would have been necessary for an audience unfamiliar with the Arthur legend. The saga also misnames certain well-known characters which may also indicate unfamiliarity with the material. The earliest medieval fragments of the saga date from the 14th century. These represent two reactions of the saga. The first survives in a single leaf, AM 598 IŒ≤ 4to. The other is represented by Stock. Perg. 4to nr 6 and the fragment AM 598 IŒ± 4to which originally belonged to the same codex. Only two leaves of this codex are preserved. Kalinke's edition of the saga is based on a 17th- century copy of the manuscript (AM 179 fol). The author of Samsons saga fagra, which gives a history of the cloak before it reaches Arthur's court, knew M√∂ttuls saga and refers to it as Skikkju saga.

He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the NXT UK brand. Prior to signing with WWE, Dragunov competed on the European independent circuit and is also known for his time with Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw), where he is a former one-time wXw Unified World Wrestling Champion, three-time wXw World Tag Team Champion and two-time wXw Shotgun Champion. Rukober is the first non-kayfabe Russian- born male wrestler to have ever competed in the WWE. Early life Rukober was born in Moscow, Russia and migrated to Germany with his mother when he was five years old. Neither he nor his mother could speak the German language. Prior to entering wrestling, Rukober worked various odd jobs from a young age to help provide for his family, including working at a pizza parlor and petrol station. Professional wrestling career Rukober started his professional wrestling training at the German Wrestling Federation (GWF) training school under veteran Rick Baxxter and Axel Tischer (who wrestles for WWE under the ring name Alexander Wolfe). He made his in-ring debut in 2012. A year later, he became a regular with wXw and would remain there until getting signed by WWE. =Progress Wrestling (2018‚Äìpresent)= On 14 May 2018 at Super Strong Style 16, wXw general manager Christian Michael Jakobi arrived in Progress Wrestling, and challenged Pete Dunne to a match with Dragunov at an undetermined date. At Chapter 69, Dragunov appeared in the promotion for the first time, squaring off with Dunne, much to Jakobi's delight. At Chapter 72, Dunne accepted the challenge and the match would be set at Progress' upcoming event at Wembley Arena. At Chapter 75, Jakobi continued to insult Dunne, to which he would drag Jakobi to the ring to attack him, before Dragunov made the save and the two faced off again. During Progress' tour of Germany, at the Oberhausen show, Dunne called out Dragunov, following British Strong Style's win over Rise (Ivan Kiev, Lucky Kid and Pete Bouncer). Once again, the two had a scuffle which had to be broken up by the officials. On 1 October, Dragunov's debut match for Progress ended in defeat, when Dunne trapped Dragunov‚Äôs arm and then manipulated his hand to force the submission. Dragunov began 2019 with a win over Timothy Thatcher at Chapter 83, but did not appear for the promotion until Super Strong Style 16. On night one, Dragunov defeated Chris Brookes in the first round. On night two, he quickly defeated Trevor Lee in the quarter-final, and on night three, he was in a three way elimination match in the semi-final with David Starr and Travis Banks. Dragunov was the first wrestler to be eliminated when Banks defeated him by pinfall. At Chapter 91, he defeated Jordan Devlin in a number one contender match for the Unified World Championship, but the following day, at Chapter 92, he was defeated by Walter. At Chapter 95, Dragunov took part in a rumble match for the Proteus Championship, which replaced the Atlas Championship. Dragunov entered in at number two in the match, and eliminated Niwa, TK Cooper and Chuck Mambo, before he and William Eaver simultaneously eliminated each other. From October to December, he was involved in a series of matches with Cara Noir. Having traded wins over each other at Chapter 96 and Chapter 97, the feud was ended at Chapter 99 in a two out of three falls match, in which Dragunov lost. =WWE (2019‚Äìpresent)= During January 2019, it was reported that Rukober would be signing with WWE, with the intention of performing for the promotion's NXT UK brand. He previously had a tryout for the promotion in November 2013, but suffered a skull injury which kept him out for almost a year. He had a second tryout in Cologne during WWE's European tour in November 2018, where he was said to have \\"turned heads\\". On February 27, 2019, WWE officially announced his signing. On the May 15 episode of NXT UK (taped April 19), Dragunov made his debut for the brand, defeating Jack Starz. He then began a short undefeated streak, defeating Joseph Conners on the June 12 episode (taped April 20), and Ashton Smith on the July 10 episode (taped June 16). However, this ended on the August 15 episode (taped July 19), when Dragunov was defeated by Kassius Ohno. On August 31, at NXT UK TakeOver: Cardiff, Dragunov answered Cesaro's open challenge in a losing effort. On the October 17 episode of NXT UK (taped October 4), Dragunov defeated Saxon Huxley under the watchful eye of Alexander Wolfe. Following the win, Wolfe applauded Dragunov, which turned into a brief staredown with the Russian when Marcel Barthel and Fabian Aichner joined him. However, it did not turn into a fight, as Barthel and Aichner walked past Dragunov for their match against The Hunt (Primate and Wild Boar), while Wolfe took him to the back, presumably to convince him to join Imperium. On the November 11 episode of NXT UK (taped October 5), Dragunov seemingly joined Imperium in their ongoing feud with Gallus (Joe Coffey, Mark Coffey and Wolfgang), before allying himself with the Scotsmen, who then proceeded to have a brawl in the ring as the show went off the air. On the November 21 episode of NXT UK (taped November 15), Dragunov was defeated by Wolfe, and after the match, was beaten down by the other members of Imperium before Gallus made the save. On the November 28 episode of NXT UK (taped November 15), Dragunov alongside Gallus, fought Imperium to a double countout. Although he got some offence in on Wolfe, he was mostly overpowered by the other members of Imperium, including a call back to the 2017 xXw 16 Carat Gold final with its leader Walter. On the December 5 episode of NXT UK (taped November 15), Dragunov appeared during the main event negotiation segment between Walter and Joe Coffey, for their title match at NXT UK TakeOver: Blackpool II. Walter wanted Dragunov to face Wolfe in a no disqualification match at a future date, but Coffey refused, since Dragunov was not a member of Gallus. Walter then said \\"No Ilja, no deal\\", to which Dragunov came out from the back and told Coffey to make the agreement. Following the negotiations, Walter told Dragunov that he had made a really bad decision, and the Russian was ambushed by the other members of Imperium before being powerbombed by Wolfe through a table. On the January 2, 2020 episode of NXT UK (taped November 16, 2019), Dragunov defeated Wolfe in the no disqualification match. In retaliation, he was beaten down by Barthel and Aichner after the match. During the main event title match between Walter and Joe Coffey on January 12, 2020 at NXT UK Takeover: Blackpool II, Wolfe interfered in the match attacking Coffey, leading to Dragunov coming out and hitting the Torpedo Moscow on Wolfe, which caused Wolfe to accidentally fall on Coffey's left knee, and injure Coffey further. As a result, after NXT UK Tag Team Champions Gallus (Mark Coffey & Wolfgang) defeated Oney Lorcan & Danny Burch on the February 13, 2020 episode of NXT UK, Dragunov came out to confront Coffey and Gallus, but led to a beat down on Dragunov by Coffey and Gallus. This was due to Coffey stating that Dragunov owed ‚Äúthe Gallus firm‚Äù a debt, and led to a match between Draganov and Coffey on the February 20, 2020 episode of NXT UK, where Dragunov defeated Coffey. After the match, Gallus‚Äô Mark Coffey and Wolfgang appeared in order to commit a post-match assault on Dragunov, but Joe Coffey stopped them and informed Dragunov that he had paid his debt and that matters were now settled.

Selected scholarship  = \\"The Evolution of Health Insurer Costs in Massachusetts, 2010-12\\" (2018) = In collaboration with Ariel Pakes, and Mark Shepard, Kate Ho and her colleagues, investigate the state of Massachusetts from 2010-2012 in relation to its costs of health insurance, targeting the progression of its enrollees. Their focus on Massachusetts, is a result of their immense range of medical prices amongst their hospitals. More specifically, it is noted that several hospitals were paid around twice the amount for a procedure, compared to others in the state. They gathered their information from the Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database (APCD) as a way of visualizing the progression of costs for healthcare during this time period. This time span was chosen as Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) made the decision to incentivize their physicians with control of costs, while Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), opted out of doing so. They stress the importance of recognizing two components before having a proper impression of the cost growth; ‚ÄúConsumers switching between plans, and differences in costs characteristics between new entrants and those leaving the market.‚Äù They mention that during this span, global payment usage, ‚Äúnon-fee-for-service‚Äù payments, nearly doubled in this state. These global payments are designed to divide associated risks with providers to promote a reduction in costs. Through use of a risk-adjusted decomposition of the enrollees cost growth, they find that HMOs have a more gradual cost increase than PMOs which may be due to individuals with better health levels transitioning from PMOs to HMOs. Alternatively, individuals with declining health rates will move from an HMO to a PMO. They connect the idea that these tactics used by HMOs, led to healthier individuals using them instead of PMOs. Hence, the researchers state that this creates further incentives to endorse these global payments. = \\"The Business Case for Diabetes Disease Management for Managed Care Organizations\\" (2006) = In conjunction with Nancy Beaulieu, David M. Cutler, George Isham, Tammie Lindquist, Andrew Nelson and Patrick O‚ÄôConnor, Kate Ho and associates, explore diabetes disease management. They recognize that diabetes diagnosis‚Äô are frequently occurring and rather expensive, and that 40 percent of those living with it, are unable to attain proper medical care management. With assistance from a Minnesota health care program, HealthPartners, the team uses their data to investigate the business case. The researchers attempt to find an answer to whether or not diabetes disease management programs are worth the investment. They state that health plans that implement a disease management program for individuals with diabetes are subjected to higher premiums and can increase their medical care savings. They are able to pinpoint certain aspects that can impede the business case for health plans; adverse selection, contracting, turnovers and network externalities. In specific, contracting difficulties, means that individuals with diabetes will have to absorb more insurance costs and this payment process proves to be difficult. Overall, they find feasible evidence that health plans can obtain economic benefits from developing better diabetes management care. A more important find is that individuals living with the disease will have an increase in the quality of their lives, if healthcare management plans choose to better themselves. = \\"Insurer-Provider Networks in the Medical Care Market\\" (2005) = In this work, Ho aims to discover the origins and welfare effects of hospital networks. She recognizes that there is a lack of research in regard to restrictions implemented by insurance agencies in hospital networks that allow their consumers to have a freedom of choice. With the use of data from care plans in 43 US markets, she reveals that markets that have a minimal amount of hospitals and insurance providers, with a significant amount of possible contracts, fail to come to a concise agreement. When hospitals form alliances, referred to as ‚Äúsystems‚Äù, they impact the degree to which insurance companies and hospitals can bargain. When this occurs, it is revealed through her analysis that these systems have a tendency to seize 19 per cent markups, as opposed to hospitals that do not enter into systems, as they claim zero markups. Furthermore, she notes that hospitals who have high expectations that their beds will be occupied, may actually be incentivized to invest less in regard to their capacity. Her research provides evidence that more hospital beds would positively affect consumers with $330,000 in benefits for each bed, which would still exceed the profits produced by the hospitals and insurers. Therefore, hospitals that are constrained by their capacity, are not incentivized to invest, due to this process of bargaining, amounting to less benefits for the consumers. Ultimately, an important outcome of these results, is that it highlights the ideal bargaining models that can be used for price negotiation in relation to hospital-health plans. = \\"The Welfare Effects of Restricted Hospital Choice in the US Medical Care Market\\" (2005) = Published in 2005, Ho performed research to analyze the effect on welfare, when health insurers restrain their consumers' ability to choose a hospital in a network, where they would then be treated. The network that has been chosen ultimately impacts consumer welfare, the design of new technology, the amount of profit captured by the hospitals, and whether or not the hospital will decide to invest in expanding capacity. By obtaining data from 43 US healthcare plan markets, Kate executes a three- step econometric model. This is devised in order to forecast enrollee's demand for a healthcare plan, based on the hospital networks that they will have access to. Her results do in fact show that when in the process of deciding a healthcare plan, consumers substantially and positively value the expected utility from the potential network of hospitals. Furthermore, with the usage of a welfare analysis, Ho finds that these selective networks actually cause an annual one billion dollar societal loss in these markets.

(2009). Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils in schools in the UK: Inclusion and ‚Äògood practice‚Äô. International Journal of Inclusive Education, 13(3), 299-314.. She studied how the everyday aspects of teaching and learning serve to marginalise certain groups of students. A result of this work was the creation of recommendations for how race, diversity and inclusion should be taught in postgraduate education courses. She joined the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2017, where she spent two years as a Visiting Professor. That year she moved from the University of Southampton to the University of Birmingham.

In January 2020 she was appointed Director of the Centre for Research in Race & Educationhttps://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/crre/staff/index.aspx. Bhopal has investigated race inequality and racism in UK academia. She has claimed that racism is present in academia in various ways; including the marginalisation of black and minority ethnic staff, their exclusion from decision-making, frequent micro-aggressions, implicit bias and open prejudice. She believes that dealing with racism is currently not a priority to UK universities. In a 2016 report from the University and College Union, almost three-quarters of black and minority ethnic staff reported that they had experienced racial harassment and bullying from managers. The same research has claimed that UK academia has racist recruitment and promotion practises and a considerable ethnicity pay gap. She believes that radical change is needed to support black and minority ethnic students. She has argued that universities work towards equality in general terms, without confronting uncomfortable practise, and ultimately perpetuating white privilege. Bhopal has called for more financial investment in the Equality Challenge Unit Race Equality Charter, so that universities recognise that it is as important as Athena SWAN. She has claimed that diversity initiatives in the United Kingdom mainly benefit white middle-class women, and that while most academics see gender as a universal issue, some only care about race in areas where racial diversity exists.

The ship's figurehead, a three-quarter length depiction of a woman with blonde hair, a white bodice and blue dress, is believed to represent Mrs Sleigh. The ship's owners were Mr Hatton and Mr Cookson who intended to use her for trading with Africa.  Explosion  On 15 January 1864 the vessel was at anchor on the River Mersey near Birkenhead when a steward knocked over a can of oil whilst trimming a lamp. The fire spread quickly and the crew successfully abandoned ship onto a passing ferry. The Lottie Sleigh's cargo of of gunpowder subsequently exploded. No deaths were caused but much damage was caused to Birkenhead and thousands of window panes across Liverpool were shattered. Locked doors were reported to have been blown open and most of the gas street lamps in Liverpool extinguished by the shock wave. Reportedly the trunk of the ancient Allerton Oak was cracked by the force of the blast. It is said that the noise of the explosion could be heard from away; indeed the authorities in Chester telegraphed Liverpool to investigate the cause of the noise. The ship's figurehead, now held in the collection of the Merseyside Maritime Museum, was recovered intact some miles away from the ship. The wreck of the vessel was beached at New Ferry and was sold on 27 January for scrap.  Insurance law  The Lottie Sleigh is a famous case in insurance law. Around 80 of the properties damaged by the explosion were insured with the same company, which paid out an average of ¬£12-13 to each claimant. The company directors were sued by some of the shareholders for paying out unnecessary claims as the policies contained the statement \\"that the company should not be responsible for any loss or damage by explosion, except such as might arise from explosion by gas\\". The directors argued that the cause of the damage was the original fire and not the explosion. The court agreed with this, despite the general insurance principle of Causa Proxima Non Remota Spectatur (\\"the proximate and not the remote cause must be looked into\\") which would hold that the fire was a remote cause and the proximate, or immediate cause, of the damage was the explosion. The case also led to a definition of the term \\"by gas\\" in the policy. The vice- chancellor of England decided that it should not be broadly construed as all explosions were caused by ignition of gas and that \\"gas\\" in this context meant only \\"coal gas\\", which was then supplied to domestic premeses for heating and lighting purposes.

Background The newspaper was founded by Julius Vogel, who had had involvement with newspapers as an editor or owner since his goldfield days in Dunolly, Victoria, in 1856. Vogel was a correspondent for The Melbourne Argus before he edited the Dunolly Advertiser, which became the Maryborough and Dunolly Advertiser. He then founded the Inglewood and Sandy Creek Advertiser. When the Victorian gold rush lost its momentum and after an unsuccessful attempt to enter the Victorian Parliament in the Avoca district in August 1861, Vogel moved to Dunedin. There, he worked for the Otago Colonist but within a short time, he co-founded the Otago Daily Times. Vogel owned the newspaper until 1866 when it was taken over by a company, but stayed on as editor for another two years. When he lost the editorship, he set up a competing newspaper, the New Zealand Sun. This newspaper failed within a few months and Vogel became editor and general manager of the Daily Southern Cross in Auckland in April 1869. His family moved from Dunedin in May 1869. In October 1873, Vogel set up The New Zealand Times Newspaper Company Ltd. His co-directors were Joseph Dransfield, George Hunter, Walter Woods Johnston, Frederick Augustus Krull (German Consul), and Edward William Mills). Later that year, this company bought The Wellington Independent. History The first issue of The New Zealand Times was published on 1 June 1874. In its editorial and via the newspaper's masthead, it was announced that this publication would now incorporate The Wellington Independent. Like its predecessor, it was a daily morning paper. Vogel's idea was to establish a national newspaper but this did not happen. Chantrey Harris bought the newspaper in 1880 and owned it until 1890, when he sold to William Baldwin. When Baldwin decided to retire to Australia the Liberal Party purchased the newspaper from him. Both John Ballance and William Pember Reeves were directors during that time. Competition arrived in 1907 with The Dominion, another morning newspaper but conservative-leaning. William John Geddis bought the newspaper in 1912. The Dominion won the market and its parent company, the Wellington Publishing Company, bought The New Zealand Times and shut it down. The last edition was published on Saturday, 29 January 1927.

She is currently a national senator-elect for the city of Buenos Aires. She was part of the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) board of directors until May 2019, when she resigned in protest over a budget reduction that severely affected the institution. Biography Dora Barrancos was born in Jacinto Ar√°uz on 15 August 1940. Her father was a teacher and school director, and her mother ‚Äì surnamed Bonjour ‚Äì was a housewife. The family moved from La Pampa Province to Buenos Aires Province, and Dora attended high school in the town of Laprida. In September 1955, a coup d'etat took place, overthrowing the constitutional government of Juan Per√≥n and beginning a military dictatorship, the self-styled Revoluci√≥n Libertadora. In 1957, Dora Barrancos enrolled in the Law School of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). In those years she was active in \\"avant-garde socialism\\". However, she ended up approaching the Justicialist Party, and joined the Peronist Youth. In 1960, her father died, and she had to start working as a teacher to support her family. She abandoned the study of law and switched to sociology at UBA's Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. In 1968, she graduated with a licentiate in sociology. After the coup d'etat of 24 March 1976 overthrew the constitutional government of Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n, Barrancos immediately lost her job as a sociologist at the Comprehensive Medical Attention Program (PAMI). Under the civil-military dictatorship, she received death threats, and several of her classmates and fellow teachers began to \\"disappear\\". However, she could not go into exile because she had two very young daughters from her first marriage, and she had to wait for a judge's decision to give her permission to travel with the girls. In May 1977, a friend told her that a Peronist Youth colleague had been kidnapped for about three days, tortured, and subjected to mock executions. When she was released, she managed to send a warning that she had explicitly mentioned Barrancos in the interrogation. That day, Barrancos and her second husband Eduardo decided to leave the girls in their father's care and escape to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where he had acquaintances. There, Barrancos came into contact with the feminist movement and other social movements that were positioned against the dictatorship. She also had her first contact with the French philosopher Michel Foucault, and entered the field of historiography. In 1984, she returned to Argentina and resigned from the Justicialist Party, considering Peronism a conservative movement - she had been a member of the Peronist Youth, the most left-wing of the Peronist factions. She began to study the political history of Argentina, publishing several studies on socialist and anarchist movements. In 1985, she presented her thesis to obtain a master's degree in education at the Faculty of Education of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, in Belo Horizonte. In 1986, she obtained the position of researcher at CONICET, and was later promoted to principal researcher. In 1993, she earned a doctorate in history at the Institute of Philosophy and Human Sciences of the University of Campinas. In 1994, when the first Buenos Aires City Legislature was created (after Buenos Aires ceased to be a municipality and became an autonomous city), Barrancos was elected as a member for the Broad Front. She became a full professor of the Latin American Social History Chair at UBA's Faculty of Social Sciences. She coordinated the master's degree program in social and cultural studies at the National University of La Pampa's Faculty of Humanities. From 2000 to 2009, she was the director of the Interdisciplinary Institute for Gender Studies (IIEGE) at UBA's Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. She currently directs the master's and doctorate programs in social sciences and humanities at the National University of Quilmes. In May 2010 ‚Äì by a vote of the scientific community ‚Äì she became director of CONICET on behalf of social and human sciences. She resigned in May 2019 in protest of a budget reduction affecting the institution. In 2016, she received the Konex Award Diploma of Merit in the Humanities. As a historian, Dora Barrancos has dedicated herself to studying the development of feminism in Argentina, the social movements of the early 20th century, the revolutions carried out by women, socialist and anarchist movements, and the role of education in Argentine history. Dora Barrancos at the Argentine Gender, Science, and Technology Network (RAGCYT) During 2018, she participated in debates about the legalization of abortion and expressed support for the bill in Senate hearings. She previously supported the Gender Identity Law, and considered it one of the most progressive in the world. In the 2010s she had a rapprochement with Peronism after a series of civilist measures: the adoption law, the legitimacy of the absolute equality of legitimate and illegitimate children, as well as divorce. Barrancos believes \\"that liberal governments did not deal with this and instead Peronism advances on civil rights.\\" In the 2019 general election, she won a seat as senator for Buenos Aires for the coalition Frente de Todos. Personal life Dora Barrancos is married and has three daughters. Considered a feminist, she has worked towards the empowerment of women, favoring policies promoted by L√°zaro Cardenas in Mexico, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n and Cristina F√©rnandez in Argentina. She has criticized political figures such as Gabriela Michetti and Mar√≠a Eugenia Vidal for their conservative positions, being critical of the scant participation of women in radicalism. She has also rehabilitated the historical figures of Eva and Juan Per√≥n for legislating women's suffrage and rights, as well as the Eva Per√≥n Foundation's actions on behalf of women and children. She has expressed support for abortion rights and the Me Too movement.

Once in the U.S. Norrie entered into a partnership with James Boorman and John Johnston, known as Boorman, Johnston & Co. to principally transact in Swedish iron. He was admitted as a partner in 1828. Their office was located on Greenwich near Cedar Street. After Boorman and Johnston died, Johnston's son, James Boorman Johnston, became Norrie's partner and they ran the firm from an office on Broadway and Wall Street (over the Bank of the Republic) until Norrie's retirement in 1875. Norrie later became one of the original stockholders of the canal between Lake Michigan and Lake Superior and one of the largest stockholders of the Milwaukee, Lake Shore & Michigan Railroad. He also served as vice president of the Bank of Savings and a director of the Bank of Commerce from its inception. He was also a trustee of the Royal Insurance Company and served as the chairman of its Finance Committee. He was also a founder of St. Luke's Hospital. Norrie joined the Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York in 1827, qualifying as a life member in 1867. He served as Manager from 1838 to 1840, second vice-president from 1843 to 1851, and president from 1851 to 1862.

A native of Portland, Oregon, Pearson was a graduate student and instructor at the University of Montana at the time of her disappearance. She disappeared days before she was scheduled to submit her doctoral thesis, as well as administer an exam for a business course she was teaching. Searches for Pearson proved unsuccessful, and her apartment was undisturbed. Her car was discovered abandoned in a business district of Missoula with her purse, keys, and other belongings inside. In 1970, bones were recovered in a rural area south of Missoula, and initially suspected to be potentially be those of Pearson, but were subsequently determined to be animal bones. Pearson's disappearance is among the oldest cold cases in the state of Montana. Background Susan Elizabeth Pearson was born October 1, 1935 in Portland, Oregon, the daughter of David and Agatha Pearson. Her father was a prominent insurance agent in Portland. She was the granddaughter of Oregon Democratic senator Walter Pearson. She had one younger brother, David, and younger sister, Virginia. In 1966, then-30-year-old Pearson was working as a part-time instructor at the University of Montana (UM) in Missoula, and working toward completing her doctoral thesis through the University of Oregon. Disappearance The University of Montana campus, where Pearson was last seen Pearson was last seen March 13, 1966 by friends on the UM campus. She was scheduled to administer a business administration exam that day, but failed to arrive. At the time of her disappearance, Pearson had been last seen wearing slacks, a green car coat with plaid lining, and two diamond rings. Susan King, a nightclub singer and friend of Pearson, told law enforcement that Pearson had visited her on March 12, the night before she disappeared, and stated that she seemed to be in a nervous, agitated, and depressed state. \\"It was just a different Sue,\\" King recalled. King also alleged that Pearson had told her in the past that she had considered leaving and starting a new life. On March 17, Pearson's vehicle was found abandoned in a business district of Missoula, with her purse, car keys, and identification inside. Pearson was reported missing the following day, March 18. It was reported that she was also scheduled to turn in her doctoral thesis, though her father later stated it was an anthropology essay that was due. Two checks for Pearson totaling $1,200 were left unclaimed. Investigation Upon inspection, Pearson's apartment at 160 Strand Avenue was found undisturbed, though her brother, David, stated that it appeared to him as though his sister had left in a hurry, as a teakettle had been left boiling on the stove, and an exterior porch light‚Äîwhich Pearson had typically left on in the evenings‚Äîhad been turned off. King told law enforcement that \\"one or two boys\\" who had received poor grades in one of the courses Pearson was teaching had \\"threatened to wreck her car.\\" On March 31, local police officers investigated a claim that Pearson had been sighted at the top of Lolo Pass, but found no evidence she had been there. In May 1966, Pearson's family hired Burleigh Allen, a former FBI agent and private detective from Billings, to investigate Pearson's disappearance. On October 29, 1970, bones from an arm and hand were discovered in the Blue Mountain region south of Missoula by several UM students. The sheriff who examined the bones at the scene suspected they may have been \\"four or five years old.\\" Investigators initially suspected the bones belonged to Pearson. However, it was reported that pathologists believed the bones were not human, and instead belonged to a bear. Dr. Buchanan, a pathologist examining them, stated: \\"Just looking at the bones, we thought the wrist bones were too large in comparison to the length of the fingers.\\" Missola County Attorney Harold J. Pisoneault stated after the discovery of the bones that it had been suspected that Pearson may have been murdered in the Blue Mountain area, though no suspect had been formally named. In 2017, it was reported that Pearson's disappearance was one of the oldest cold cases in the state of Montana.

He became known for his severely classical compositions, which included the ceiling decorations of many churches and public buildings. He was a committee Republican and secularist, and participated in the French revolutions of 1848 and 1870‚Äì71. Family Armand F√©lix Marie Jobb√©-Duval was born on 17 July 1821 in Carhaix, where his father Thomas F√©lix Jobb√©-Duval (1787‚Äì1860), was an engineer and chief surveyor for the cadastre (land registry) of Finist√®re, Brittany. He was the youngest of four children of Thomas F√©lix Jobb√©-Duval and Charlotte Le Tournoux de Villegeorges (1791-1828), both from Rennes, who had married on 28 November 1811. He married Marie Louise Sophie Jacquemart (1831‚Äì1917) in the √âglise Saint-Laurent, Paris, and they had four children between 1850 and 1865. Artistic career Jobb√©-Duval studied at the Tour d‚ÄôAuvergne college in Quimper, where he showed artistic qualities and talents in sketching. He obtained a grant from the General Council of Finist√®re to attend the School of Fine Arts in Paris, which he entered on 1 April 1840. His first teacher was the painter Paul Delaroche (1797‚Äì1856) , then in 1843 he joined the studio of Charles Gleyre (1806‚Äì1874). He was allowed to compete for the Prix de Rome five times between 1842 and 1847, and developed a rigorous style to meet academic requirements. Van Gogh (3rd from left) with Gauguin, √âmile Bernard, F√©lix Jobb√©-Duval and Andr√© Antoine (c. 1887) Jobb√©-Duval joined the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais and was part of the salon's jury from 1861. He was acquainted with many artists, including the landscape artists Jean-Fran√ßois Millet (1814‚Äì1875) and Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny (1817‚Äì1878). With Paul Gauguin (1848‚Äì1903) he discovered the famous Pension Gloanec in Pont-Aven. His religious and historical paintings contain many references to the moral and political issues being discussed during the Second French Empire and French Third Republic. Jobb√©-Duval established his reputation with a series of monumental decorative paintings in the churches of Saint-S√©verin and Saint- Sulpice in Paris, working at the same time as Eug√®ne Delacroix (1798‚Äì1863). During his career he received many commissions from the Church and the state. He decorated other churches of Paris such as La Trinit√© and St-Gervais-et-St- Protais, as well as public buildings such as the Commercial Court of Paris and Lyon City Hall. In 1867 he was invited to decorate the ceiling of the Third Chamber of Correctional Appeals in the southwestern pavilion of the Parlement of Brittany in Rennes. His composition represented Truth, in the form of a strongly-built nude woman, surrounded by Justice, Innocence and Law. At their feet are Crimes, with dark and muscular bodies. The composition shows the influence of Jean Jouvenet, Ingres, Michelangelo and this master Paul Delaroche. Political activity Jobb√©-Duval was a militant Republican. He participated in demonstrations during February Revolution in which the July Monarchy was overthrown, and was part of the Government of National Defense during the Paris Commune in 1871. He was elected to the municipal council of the 15th arrondissement of Paris on 30 July 1871, and was reelected on 29 November 1874, 6 January 1878, 16 January 1881 and 4 May 1884. He resigned on 29 April 1887. He was a Freemason, Fourierist and committed secularist. He initiated establishing an institution for incurable young children, and municipal lay orphanages. Jobb√©-Duval died in Paris on 2 April 1889. A street in the 15th arrondissement is named in his honor. His nephew, F√©lix Jobb√©- Duval (1879‚Äì1961), became well-known as an illustrator for children's books and magazines. In 2017 the Rennes Museum of Fine Arts acquired a collection of over 250 drawings by Jobb√©-Duval. These include studies of the figures and drapery used in most of the artist's major public decorations.

It is situated not far from the Bri≈°tane village in the administrative area of the Town of Drni≈°, ≈†ibenik-Knin County. Located between the Visovac Lake and Ro≈°ki Slap waterfall, it perks up like an eagle in unreachable eagle's nest on the edge of a cliff. Once property of the powerful Nelipiƒá noble family, the castle was captured and destroyed in 1522/23 by the Ottoman invaders, never to be rebuilt. History Kamiƒçak was first mentioned in 1345 in a document issued by the Croato-Hungarian king Ludovik I of Angevin to confirm the property of the castle to Ivan II Nelipiƒá, whose family possessed it at least from the 11th century. According to oral tradition, it is assumed that Petar Svaƒçiƒá (Snaƒçiƒá), the last king of the independent Kingdom of Croatia, killed in the battle of Gvozd Mountain in 1097, was born in Kamiƒçak, since the Nelipiƒá family descended from the Svaƒçiƒá tribe. The last male member of the Nelipiƒá family was Ivani≈° (‚Ä†1434), who gave the castle to his son-in-law Ivan VI An≈æ Frankopan. The king Sigismund of Luxemburg however did not recognize it and gave the castle to Talovac noble family. In 1445 Kamiƒçak was given to Grgur/Gregory Utje≈°inoviƒá, who donated the island of Visovac to the members of Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena. His son, the influential Cardinal Juraj/George Utje≈°inoviƒá was born in the castle in 1482. That is why the local people until today call Kamiƒçak the ‚ÄûCastle of Utje≈°inoviƒá‚Äú or ‚ÄûTown of Utje≈°inoviƒá‚Äú (Utje≈°inoviƒáa grad). There are some other people who originate from Kamiƒçak area, for instance Marko Mi≈°ljenoviƒá, Ban (Viceroy) of Croatia, who ruled 1506‚Äì1507. A couple of years later, the castle belonged to the Halapiƒá brothers, who were present at the election of Croato-Hungarian king Vladislaus II Jageloviƒá in 1490. After conquering Kingdom of Bosnia in 1463, the Ottoman forces increased pressure on Croatian borders all the time, which lead to fall of Kamiƒçak in 1522/1523. The ruined castle had no importance for the Turks and was abandoned, never to be rebuilt.

CareerBased on the article written by J√°nos Szoboszlai, https://artportal.hu/lexikon-muvesz/varnagy-tibor-1123/ last accessed: 28 October 2019  From the 1980s he has been a representative of the so-called alternative artistic endeavors. He also plays an active role in the experimental application of photography as fine art. In addition to this he draws, occasionally paints and creates collages or objects for different installations. V√°rnagy is a founding member of the Substitute Thirstershttps://artportal.hu/lexikon-szocikk/hejettes-szomlyazok/ last accessed: 28 October 2019 artist group and participated in their exhibitions between 1984 and 1990. From 1991 to 1994 he worked with √Ågnes Eperjesi, and later organized occasional exhibitions with Gyula V√°rnai, Zolt√°n √Åd√°m, Dezs≈ë Tandori, Andrea Hajagos. His activity has been characterized by experimentation and, since the 1990s, social sensitivity. He edited the (quasi) periodical Manaps√°g between 2001 and 2004. An alternative version of this, Manamana was published on the occasion of the Service exhibition at M≈±csarnok (Kunsthalle) Budapest. The critical, activist publication and project was edited and organised in association with Mikl√≥s Erhardt. Several artists took part in it (Dominik Hislop, Andreas Fogarasi, R√≥za El Hassan, Toma S√≠k etc. as well as numerous artworks were given to the publication by G√°bor Bakos, Tibor Horv√°th, etc.). V√°rnagy has had a photoblog since 2006 and a video blog since 2009. As a critic and art writer, he deals with contemporary art and regularly publishes in the periodical Balkon and other art magazines. V√°rnagy has been the director of the Liget Gallery in Budapest since its foundation in 1983.Small non-profit gallery operating since 1983. It is maintained by the Zugl√≥ Cultural Center (Zugl√≥ Cserepes Non Profit Cultural Ltd.). Since its founding, it has exhibited nearly 500 exhibitions and other events, promotions, performances, concerts, screenings, talks in Budapest and in foreign and other Hungarian cities. In the 1980s, the gallery first began to show foreign artists, mainly from Central Europe, in the framework of independent exhibitions (2nd Portfolio of Eastern European Artists - curated by John P. Jacob, 1986. Heinz Cibulka, Sibylle Hofter, Milan Kn√≠≈æ√°k, ≈Å√≥d≈º Kaliska, Hermann Nitsch, etc.) and exchange numerous exhibitions with foreign partners. In the first half of the 1990s, Liget‚Äôs most important undertaking was the presentation of the Contemporary Hungarian Epigone Exhibitions (Liget Gallery, Budapest 1992; KX Kampnagel Fabrik, Hamburg 1993; Liget Gallery and T≈±zolt√≥ Street, Budapest, 1994). Director: Tibor V√°rnagy. For further information see: Tibor V√°rnagy (ed.): Liget Gallery 1983-1990 (catalog, 14th district Cultural House, n. d.); (Liget Gallery 1990/1995 (catalog, Cserepesh√°z, 1996). Based on the article written by G√©za Boros, https://artportal.hu/lexikon-intezmeny/liget-galeria/ (last accessed: 28 October 2019 As a gallery director, curator and cultural organizer, he implements an exhibition program focusing on progressive experimental genres (performance, experimental photography, intermedia, new wave). It features innovative, interdisciplinary exhibitions and events other than the mainstream, including politically and socially radical activist works and projects. It is decisive both for his own curatorial activities and for the Liget Gallery as well that he has established direct collaborations and exhibition exchanges with foreign partners since the mid-1980s. This process was initiated by the II. Portfolio of Eastern European Artists project (curated by John P. Jacob, 1986) which has established long-term cooperation with the American curator in the form of exhibitions not only in Hungary and the US but also in Germany and China. There has been a continuous working relationship with the Ma≈Ça Gallery in Warsaw, the Fotogalerie Wien and the Projektf√∂rderunk Bildende Kunst led by Monika Wucher and Christoph Rauch in Hamburg, as well as occasional collaborations with many artists, curators and institutions.

It is located at the intersection of Broadway and Saint Nicholas Avenue between 167th and 168th Streets in Mitchel Square Park, New York City, New York. Mitchel Square World War I memorial Context The Inwood Monument was dedicated on Memorial Day, May 30, 1922. It honors men \\"from the adjacent communities in northern Manhattan of Washington Heights and Inwood\\" who fought and died during WWI. The monument commemorates servicemen from three distinct branches of the military: the Navy, the Army, and the Marine Corps. = Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney = The monument‚Äôs sculptor, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, traveled to France during WWI to start a hospital in Juilly and dedicate her time to aiding the injured. Unlike other war memorials, her figures depict the realities of war, illustrating the experiences of average servicemen at war. Whitney portrayed these men realistically, deriving inspiration from her original sketches while in France, as seen in her memorial sculptures, including the Inwood Monument and Victory Arch. Whitney spent her life as both an arts patron and an artist, although for the majority of her time she only received recognition for her patronage. The lack of commendation for her artistic achievements resulted largely from gender stereotypes and the impact of her immense wealth on others‚Äô views of her persona. The interplay of Whitney‚Äôs two roles spurred her entrance into sculpting public monuments, such as the Inwood Monument, which depict themes from WWI and Whitney‚Äôs own wartime experiences. The monuments gave her a socially-accepted venue for self- expression. Design The Inwood Monument‚Äôs three-figure sculpture originated from a wartime sketch, and began as a clay sculpture of two figures. The third figure was added later in Whitney's design process, comprising her final product. Whitney initially created an interplay of two figures, a sculpture entitled His Bunkie, which was modeled between 1916 and 1919 and cast in bronze upon its completion in 1919. It represents a standing and a kneeling serviceman. After Whitney‚Äôs commission for the monument, she added a third figure to His Bunkie which kneels beneath the original two, as they support their third, fallen companion. She also created a smaller scale version of the Inwood monument, fashioned between 1921 and 1922, and cast in bronze in 1922; Whitney used this version as a model for the final structure displaying the soldier, the sailor, and the marine. The inscription on the granite pedestal of the monument reads, ‚ÄúErected by the people of Washington Heights and Inwood in commemoration of the men who gave their lives in the World War‚Äù. There are 20 star-shaped plaques made of bronze and set into a ‚Äútwo-colored flagstone paving,‚Äù surrounding the monument and its base. The plaques symbolize fatalities of 357 men local to the Manhattan area surrounding Mitchel Square Park. An overarching theme expressed by the Inwood Monument is the honoring of the common soldier in wounded condition, which differentiates Whitney's monument from war memorials which glorify war or well-known generals. Construction The sculpture of the three servicemen was first modeled between 1921 and 1922, and later cast in bronze by the Roman Bronze Company of Greenpoint in 1922. The figures are supported by a plinth on an octagonal base made of white marble, topped by a circular, Deer Isle granite pedestal with twenty plaques, all of which were constructed by Alfred Randolph Ross of the firm Delano and Aldrich. The Inwood Monument was commissioned as a public monument by the Washington Heights and Inwood Memorial Association. Whitney was commissioned to sculpt the monument, and her contract was drafted in July of 1921. It took a total of ten months for her to finalize the monument, and it was completed May 26, 1922, only days before its dedication on Memorial Day of the same year. Dedication The Inwood Monument‚Äôs dedication ceremony took place on May 30th, 1922, Memorial Day, to coincide with ‚Äúthe parades and military demonstrations throughout the five boroughs‚Äù. Several citizens and war veterans, along with Colonel William Hayward, marched through Mitchel Square Park, leading up to the dedication service. They, along with Mayor Hylan of New York, members of both the Washington Heights and Inwood Memorial Association and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and various clergymen and politicians were in attendance at the ceremony. The dedication also notably occurred on the same day that Mitchel Square Park was given in honor of Mayor John Purroy Mitchel, who died during air service training for the Army Aviation Corps of WWI. Restoration and conservation The Inwood Monument was fully restored in 1998 through a conservation effort funded by citizen contributions and a grant from the U.S. World War I Centennial Commission. A significant contributor to the funding was former New York City Council Member Guillermo Linares. The endeavor was spearheaded by Rudolph L. Leibel, a professor at Columbia University and veteran of the U.S. Army Medical Corps, who felt a personal connection to the monument after years of passing by it every day. The New York City Parks Department assembled a team which accomplished various repairs, including a replica of the vandalized bayonet from the Army soldier‚Äôs rifle, cast by the Bedi-Makky Art Foundry in Brooklyn. The bayonet was stolen upwards of two times, sparking Leibel‚Äôs motivation to launch a conservation undertaking. Beyond the bayonet replica, this conservation included repointing of the stone masonry and application of protective wax coating to all bronze elements of the monument. Most recently, a ceremony was held in the park on November 7, 2018, to commemorate both the restoration of the monument and the centennial of the end of WWI, at which Professor Leibel gave a speech.

He worked in the weaving trade before becoming manager of the George and Dragon Hotel in Huddersfield in 1887, where he learnt to play billiards to a high standard He played matches for money before challenging for the world championship title. Dawson won the billiards title against John North in 1899, but the match attracted little attention as leading player John Roberts Jr. was not involved. In 1900, H. W.

Stevenson beat Diggle in the preliminary round, compiling a break of 648 in the match, but lost 6,775‚Äì9,000 to Dawson. In January 1901, Stevenson beat Dawson to win the title, but Dawson then won it back in April. Following the April match, Stevenson challenged Dawson again. The match was due to be played within three months of the challenge being made, but both players agreed to a postponement until November. Although Dawson was aware that the match was due to be played in November, he organised an exhibition match with Diggle in Glasgow for that month and was unavailable for the championship match. Stevenson refused a further extension, and was awarded the title. Dawson and Stevenson contested the title again in 1903, with Dawson winning a close match 9,000‚Äì8,700. Following this, the championship was not contested for several years. In 1908, the Billiards Association declared Melbourne Inman the champion. In 1904, Dawson published a book called \\"Practical Billiards,\\" which included player biographies. His highest break at billiards, excluding the anchor stroke, was 823.

Person's sculptures, and later, drawings, are recognized for their particular sensitivity to color and surface markings.  Life  Leroy Person was born, raised, and lived out his entire life near the Albemare Sound at the edge of a swamp called Occhineechee Neck in northeast North Carolina. He was raised by a family of sharecroppers and continued the farm until he began working at a sawmill. He received partial schooling as a child and was para-literate. According to Roger Manley, director of the Gregg Museum of Art and Design at North Carolina State University, Person wrote and operated under his own numerals and alphabet that he and a few other family members could decipher. Person married twice ‚Äì once to Rosemary Person and then to Frances Person. Frances was an accomplished quilter and artist herself. After Person was hospitalized in 1982 for acute asthma, without access to his tools or his strength for carving, he began drawing with crayon on paper and cardboard. Although his oeuvre of drawings is not as prolific as his sculptures, he made a significant body of work before dying in 1985 from respiratory disease.  Career  Leroy Person worked for the sawmill his entire adult life, until work-related respiratory problems forced his retirement in the mid 1960s. After his retirement, with little else to occupy his time, Person he began carving and etching into his fence and the siding of his house. His decorations went unnoticed or unappreciated by family, and feeling discouraged, Person disposed of his first works. After much encouragement from his neighbor, Ozette Bell, Person picked up carving again on free-standing wood pieces and began to carve what is now recognized as a cohesive body of sculptures and furniture. Although none were photographed, art historians note that Person also weaved meticulous baskets. This is an indication that other members of his family were skilled crafts- people because the intricate skills of basketry are rarely self-taught. = Subject and inspiration = Person's works frequently employ images of trees, animals, his tools, and circles (which often resemble saw blades), letters and numerals of his own creation. His work has often been compared to Sub-Saharan African sculpture for its dense geometric patterns. William Arnett likened his freestanding sculptures to that of the Dogon people of Mali while Colin Rhodes compared his furniture to the Bambara people of the African Niger River region. Despite these comparisons, Person's works are sui generis. They are simultaneously a product of centuries of African culture in America and his life spent virtual isolation in Ochineechee Neck. Person often colored his wooden sculptures and furniture with crayons, which created a dichotomy between his very delicate color palette and the bold weight of his material. Some of Person's patterns of color and etching mimic his wife, Frances's, quilting patterns, although no one photographed her quilts to make a formal comparison. The similarities were even more apparent after Person switched from sculpture to drawing while hospitalized during the last three years of his life. Most of his drawings comprised squares and rectangles filled with contrasting colors, which distinctly resemble improvisational African American quilts of the southeast.

Amapiano is a sophisticated hybrid of deep house, jazz and lounge music characterized by synths, airy pads and wide basslines. It is distinguished by high pitched piano melodies, Kwaito basslines, low tempo 90s South African house rhythms and percussions from another local subgenre of house known as Bacardi.  Origins  Although the genre gained popularity in Gauteng, there's a lot of ambiguity concerning its origins. It originates with various accounts of the musical styles in the Johannesburg townships - Soweto, Alexandra, Vosloorus and Katlehong. Because of the genre's similarities with Barcadi, some people assert the genre began in the Pretoria area with DJ Mojava which was made popular by Pretoria taxi drivers and has been an on going debate about the origin of Amapiano. Various accounts as to who formed the popular genre make it impossible to accurately pinpoint its origins.  Popularity  Initially, Amapiano was a confined success in the townships, playing in popular pubs and taverns around Gauteng. The sound itself was underground music, being shared around using messaging apps, more commonly WhatsApp, before it became mainstream being recognised by streaming services such as Deezer, Spotify, Apple Music. The genre was further popularised by DJs who would transform popular music hits and incorporating the jazzy low-tempo into those tracks, including DJ Ganyani and Kabza De Small. As of 2020, Amapiano is getting more mainstream across Africa; there are several dedicated charts now, more playlists on digital platforms, not just by South Africans alone.  Criticism  In January 2019, German-born American-based DJ Lars Behrenroth criticized the genre and its artists on Twitter. The tweet caused a major uproar of many fans of the genre. His comment also prompted several artists such as Black Coffee, Zakes Bantwini, Kid Fonque, Busiswa and Cassper Nyovest to defend the genre and laughed off Lars' criticism. Prince Kaybee also took to Twitter to slam Lars's comment and told him to \\"leave us and our music alone\\".

Founded in the late-16th-century, and significantly expanded in the early-18th-century, it is remarkable as an \\"important example\\" of the vernacular architecture of both periods. History The house was apparently built at the end of the 16th century by Ellis ap Cadwaladr (d. 1597), a member of the Welsh Ellis family, which claimed to trace its lineage back to Gollwyn ap Tangno, founder of one of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales. Ellis obtained the property from the Crown, and is the first member of the family to be described as \\"of Ystumllyn\\". When it was first built, the house was likely one of the earliest storied buildings in the region. Before 20th-century renovations, the house bore two dated inscriptions of 1720 and 1729 giving a likely date for the extensive 18th- century remodeling and extensions. The owner in this period was Rev. Humphrey Wynn (d. 1724), whose initials are featured on the earlier of these inscriptions. By 1725, it was in the possession of Ellis Wynn (d. 1759) who held in until his death. In 1824, the estate passed to philologist Rowland Jones. The roof was raised and the fenestration was remodeled in the 19th century. In , J. Egbert Griffiths of Porthmadog carried out several minor alterations, adding some extra windows and rearranging the internal room structure. On 12 December 1994, the building was designated a Grade II* listed building, a listing reserved for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". The house was home to several local notables throughout its history. The Welsh poet Gruffydd Phylip (d. 1666) composed several poems addressed to the Ellis family, including a poem directly referencing the house, \\"\\" (\\"The Bard's Longing for Ystumllyn\\"). John Ystumllyn (d. 1786), who took his name from the household, was employed by the Wynn family at this estate as a gardener and survives as the first well-recorded black person of North Wales. He was of uncertain origins, and was possibly kidnapped from Africa by the Wynn family, but lived out a happy life in Ystumllyn, eventually running away with and marrying a local woman. Architecture Chronological plan of Ystumllyn. Ystumllyn is a rubble-built house of two stories, composed of two blocks arranged into a T-shaped plan. The east-facing block is the earliest part of the building, dating to the late 16th century, while the north-facing block (which bisects the east block) was constructed in the early 18th century. The building has been described as historically remarkable in the British Listed Buildings rationale for registering it as a Grade II* listed building; its original component \\"incorporates an important example\\" of 16th-century architecture, while its 18th-century additions \\"represent high quality vernacular work of the period\\".

The work is Abnett's first published novelAbnett, Dan. The Founding omnibus, , BL Publishing, Foreword, \\"Welcome to the Sabbat Worlds\\", and was also the first novel published under Games Workshop's Black Library imprint. Prior to then, Games Workshop published short stories in its magazine Inferno!, and a limited number of novels, including Ian Watson's novel Space Marine and Inquisition War trilogy, under the label \\"Heretic Tomes.\\" As of 2006, it remained Black Library's best- selling title.  Publication history  Abnett first wrote a set of loosely connected short stories which appeared in Inferno! magazine (issues 4, 8, and 30). The next story, entitled \\"Vermilion Level\\", was written out to novel length as First and Only and published in 1999. The earlier-published short stories were subsequently incorporated as flashback-style chapters of Ghostmaker, the second volume of the series. The first three novels of the series, First and Only, Ghostmaker, and Necropolis were collected, along with the short story \\"In Remembrance\\", into the omnibus The Founding, published by Black Library in 2007. In 2013, First and Only was re-published as one of Black Library's three earliest-published and most influential novels, along with Graham McNeill's Nightbringer (also taking place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe), and William King's Trollslayer (the inaugural novel of the Gotrek and Felix series taking place in the Warhammer Fantasy universe). In 2019, Black Library announced a limited edition hardcover re-publication to commemorate the novel's 20th anniversary.https://www.blacklibrary.com/all- products/first-and-only-20th-anniversary-ed--ebook-2019.html (last accessed 28 October 2019)  Synopsis  In the 41st Millennium, the Tanith First light infantry regiment of the Imperial Guard is part of the massive Imperial force fighting to retake the Sabbat Worlds from the forces of Chaos. The regiment is informally called the \\"First And Only\\" (because it was actually formed from the survivors of three regiments raised just before their homeworld of Tanith was destroyed by the enemy), or sometimes \\"Gaunt's Ghosts\\", after their commanding officer, Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt, and their superlative skills at stealth and infiltration tactics. During their latest combat theatre, the Ghosts are instrumental in re-taking the world of Fortis Binary from the enemy, partnered with the Vitrian Dragoons regiment, while another regiment, the Jantine Patricians, feel cheated of glory. Granted temporary R&R; on Pyrites, the Ghosts escape a trap laid for them by the Patricians. Gaunt is contacted by an old friend, Fereyd, who warns him that the army's superior, Lord General Dravere, is conspiring to supplant Warmaster Macaroth as supreme commander of the campaign, and something hidden on the campaign's next target world, Menazoid Epsilon, is vital to the conspiracy. While en route to Menazoid Epsilon, Gaunt's subordinate, Major Rawne, is abducted by Patrician soldiers and brutally interrogated by Inquisitor Heldane, who is assisting General Dravere's plans. The Ghosts rescue Rawne, and Heldane is badly wounded. In the midst of the fighting on Menazoid Epsilon, Fereyd rendezvous with Gaunt, who leads him to an underground bunker containing an incredible find from mankind's \\"Dark Age of Technology\\": an intact Standard Template Constructor, an automated factory capable of mass-producing \\"Men of Iron\\" (self-aware robots). Dravere and Heldane's agents discovered evidence of the factory and realized they could build an army loyal to themselves that was powerful enough for any purpose. Dravere, aware now that the Ghosts are working against his plans, declares them traitors and orders the Jantine Patricians to wipe them out. The small picket force of Ghosts that Gaunt left behind to guard their rear is killed to the last man by the Patricians, but not before inflicting three-to-one casualties on their attackers, which further enrages the Patricians' commander, Colonel Flense. To Fereyd's surprise, Gaunt insists that the factory must be destroyed immediately. Fereyd is actually a puppet, being controlled by Heldane's psychic powers from his sickbed inside Dravere's headquarters vehicle. Heldane panics and orders Fereyd to kill Gaunt, but Major Rawne (who Gaunt suspected of being brainwashed by Heldane in captivity) saves Gaunt's life by shooting Fereyd in the head. This causes a massive feedback in Heldane's psychic energies that explodes, destroying Dravere's headquarters and killing both conspirators. The novel is intercut with a series of flashbacks: the young Ibram Gaunt is orphaned when his father is killed in action, and raised by his father's commanding officer, General Aldo Dercius. But during his first campaign as a Commissar, Gaunt is approached by an enemy prisoner, a rogue psychic, who tells him the truth: his father died when Dercius fled the battle and left the elder Gaunt to die. Using his ostensible authority to punish cowardice, Gaunt confronts his \\"Uncle\\" Dercius and kills him in a sword duel. After blowing up the factory, Gaunt and his small entourage are confronted by Colonel Flense, who reveals that he is General Dercius's son, and was forced to change his name and restart his career from scratch after the family disgrace. Flense tries to kill Gaunt, but Gaunt gains the upper hand and kills him instead. When the Ghosts emerge from the bunker, they are confronted by the remaining Patricians, who are themselves ambushed and slaughtered by the Vitrian Dragoons, coming to the Ghosts' aid. With Dravere dead, there is no record of his orders declaring the Ghosts renegades, and the Patricians are posthumously disgraced and permanently disbanded. Before he died, Fereyd tried to convince Gaunt that the Men of Iron could have been used to aid the Imperial forces as much as the Chaos forces. Remembering this, Major Rawne asks Gaunt why he decided to destroy them instead. Gaunt confides that the same psychic who told him the truth about his father's death also predicted his dilemma, years later, on Menazoid Epsilon, and warned him that leaving the Men of Iron intact would lead to nothing but disaster.

IWRG has held their Castillo del Terror show since 2005, usually late in the year. As with the majority of the IWRG shows it will take place at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, the home of IWRG. The main event is the eponymous Castillo del Terror Steel cage match where the last person eliminated would be forced to unmasked per the Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", stipulation. In the main event, 12 men (Ave Rex, Drag√≥n Bane, Imposible, El Hijo de Canis Lupus, Dinamic Black, Toxin, Aramis, Rel√°mpago, Capo del Norte, Tortuga Leo, √Ångel Tormenta and Death Metal) risked their mask in a steel cage match where the last wrestler remaining will be forced to unmask. In the end √Ångel Tormenta was the last man in the cage as El Hijo de Canis Lupus climbed out. √Ångel Tormenta unmasked afterwards and revealed that his real name was Jorge Alberto Flores Perez and he had been a professional wrestler for three years at that point. The show also featured a Super Libre match between Los Traumas (Trauma I and Trauma II) and Los Lucha Brothers (Penta el 0M (Rey F√©nix), in which Los Lucha Brothers won by disqualification. Production =Background= Starting as far back as at least 2002, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2005 IWRG has promoted a fall show, around the Mexican Day of the Death, under the name El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\"), or IWRG Prisi√≥n Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Castillo del Terror shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2019 Castillo del Terror show will be the 15th year in a row that IWRG has promoted a show under that name. =Storylines= The El Castillo del Terror event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed themselves as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in wrestling matches.

It was released on November 8, 2019. Like the previous two Mount Eerie albums it concerns the death of Genevi√®ve Castr√©e, the first wife of Mount Eerie's principal member Phil Elverum, as well as his recent divorce from Michelle Williams. The album is a sequel to the 2008 collaborative album Lost Wisdom.  Background and composition  In 2015, four months after the birth of their first child, Phil Elverum's wife, Canadian cartoonist and musician Genevi√®ve Castr√©e, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She died at their home in Anacortes, Washington, on July 9, 2016. In 2018 he married actress Michelle Williams. Around the same time, Elverum moved from his longtime residence in Anacortes to Williams' home in Brooklyn. The couple separated in January 2019, and filed for divorce in April 2019. Following the split, Elverum moved back to Washington state, after having lived in New York for about nine months. By November 2019, it was reported that they were no longer married. Recording took place between May 26 and June 1, 2019. Due to Elverum recording the album with the door open, natural sounds such as breaths, birds, jackhammering and night air are featured throughout the album. The majority of the album was written in the space of the three weeks before recording. When it came to the writing of the album Phil Elverum was quoted as saying The entirety of the lyrics were Elverum's creation as were a majority of the melodies. Doiron wrote all the melodies performed by her. By the time of Doiron's inclusion all the songs were nearing completion. Their collaboration was the result of touring together and years of discussion. Elverum knew that he wanted to make the record with Doiron and enlisted her help before he had created any of the songs and so quickly created first drafts before her arrival.  Release and promotion  Two singles were released ahead of the album. \\"Love Without Possession\\" was released on September 25, 2019, with Pitchfork writing that \\"it is a calm, clear-eyed meditation on love as a word, a mythology, and a natural event with the power to devastate and heal\\". The second single \\"Belief pt. 2\\" was released on October 22, 2019. In a press statement, Phil Elverum was quoted as saying \\"'Belief pt. 2' is the last song on the album. It comes at the end of a meandering path through uncertainty, devotion, sad reminiscence, hopeful idealism; songs coursing over uneven terrain.\\" Reception Lost Wisdom Pt. 2 received generally positive reviews upon release. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album has received an average score of 79 based on 12 critics, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\". Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave Lost Wisdom pt.2 7.9 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Laura Snapes of The Guardian called the album \\"A set of disconcertingly painful songs\\" and that \\"it may be the rare album that works better on paper\\". Patrick Clarke of NME stated that \\"Elverum shares a complicated and conflicted headspace with masterful simplicity, conveying a mood that sways from calmness to anxiety, from warm nostalgia to stinging regret.\\" Heather Phares of Allmusic stated that \\"its songs have stretched out a bit to encompass more grief and more hope. As Elverum bridges the gap between the in-the-moment confessions of A Crow Looked at Me and Now Only\\" Matthew Neale of Consequence of Sound found that \\"In spite of those fleeting moments of discord, Lost Wisdom Pt. 2 is an extraordinarily rewarding listen\\" with particular praise to the track \\"Widows\\" stating that \\"‚ÄúWidows‚Äù is superb, the only moment on the record when cymbals crash and guitars churn, a reminder that the Mount Eerie project is still capable of producing moments of exhilaration with the most basic building blocks\\" although did admit that its presence on the album was jarring. In regards to the best aspect of the album, Eric Hill of Exclaim wrote that it was \\"how Elverum manages to merge his recent more plainspoken diary style with the elegiac and alchemical metaphors of his early voice\\" he also praised the exploration of the theme of love on the album. Harry Todd of Paste like other writers noted how the album \\"harkens back to his earlier work\\", he also said that it \\"feels like a quiet revelation\\",\\"which finds Elverum reckoning with a reinvigorated loneliness.\\" Grayson Haver Currin of Pitchfork described the album as \\"a moment of astounding grace for a world always in need of more.\\" Jonathan Bernstein of Rolling Stone wrote that \\"Elverum is still meditating on grief and grace with poignancy on this hyper-literal album\\", he also praised the chemistry of Elverum and Doiron writing that \\"Elverum and Doiron work together with an intimacy that conveys a lifetime of collaboration and creation\\" Daniel Bromfield of Spectrum Culture called the album \\"a portrait of a mind in flux\\" and that \\"it‚Äôs a treat to hear Elverum up to his old hijinks again.\\" The inclusion of Doiron had a generally positive reception. Heather Phares of AllMusic complimented Doiron's inclusion saying that \\"Doiron helps him convey how layered his loss is.\\" As did Harry Todd of Paste, stating that \\"Doiron comments like a Greek chorus... just as much as she sounds like a cathartic unconscious. Drifting in and out of spectral harmonizing on each of the album's eight tracks, Doiron's simmering soprano always adds impactful texture while still knowing when to let Elverum sing alone\\". Grayson Haver Currin of Pitchfork shared similar feelings writing that \\"Doiron‚Äôs presence, is a welcome balm, warming these cold realizations and offering Elverum a steadying hand for some of the most difficult moments.\\" Matthew Neale of Consequence of Sound on the other hand while liking her vocals in some moments also felt like her inclusion could feel \\"intrusive\\" and \\"frequently sound awkward and uneven.\\" Track listing Personnel *Phil Elverum ‚Äì songwriting, vocals *Julie Doiron ‚Äì vocals Production *Rin-san Jeff Miller ‚Äì photograph *Nicholas Wilbum ‚Äì digital mastering *John Golden ‚Äì vinyl mastering *Stoughton Printing ‚Äì jackets *Cascade ‚Äì vinyl pressing References Category:2019 albums Category:Julie Doiron albums Category:Mount Eerie albums ","title":"Lost Wisdom pt. 2"},{"id":"62187142","text":"Cimabue, Virgin and Child with Two Angels, National Gallery Virgin and Child with Two Angels is a panel painting by 13th-century Italian artist Cimabue, in egg tempera on a poplar panel, dated to c. 1280. It has been held by the National Gallery in London since 2000. The painting measures . It depicts the Virgin and Child seated together on a throne, accompanied by two angels with long feathered wings. The composition is based on Byzantine models, but modified for a Western European audience: the throne has become three dimensional, and the figures of the Virgin and Child are more human and less stylised than similar traditional Byzantine icons such as the Hodegetria. It was rediscovered at Benacre Hall near Lowestoft in Suffolk in 2000, after the death of Sir John Gooch, 12th Baronet, as the contents of the house were being prepared for an auction sale. It may have been acquired in Florence in the early 19th century by his ancestor, Sir Edward Gooch, 6th Baronet, and survived a fire at the house in the 1920s. It is one of three panels known from a polyptych depicting the passion of Christ. From its physical characteristics, it was the top left of four panels on the left leaf of a diptych, and it quickly became apparent from its size, style and method that it was almost identical to a panel held by the Frick Collection in New York since 1950, The Flagellation of Christ. The discovery of this panel encouraged a change in the attribution of the Frick panel from Duccio to Cimabue. A third panel, Christ Mocked, was found in France in 2019, and auctioned for 24 million euros. The panel was put up for sale and was expected to sell for ¬£10 million, but before it was sold, it was accepted in lieu of inheritance tax and allocated to the National Gallery. The heirs were granted a ¬£6.5 million tax exemption, and a donation from Sir John Paul Getty Jr. allowed the gallery to pay a further ¬£700,000. The other contents of the hall were sold in May 2000 for ¬£8.3 million, a record for a country house sale in the UK.

The idea is to help manage work-life balance and benefits of FWA can include reduced employee stress and increased overall job satisfaction. On the contrary, some refrain from using their FWA as they fear the lack of visibility can negatively affect their career. Overall, this type of arrangement has a positive effect on incompatible work/family responsibilities, which can be seen as work affecting family responsibilities or family affecting work responsibilities. FWA is also helpful to those who have a medical condition or an intensive care-giving responsibility, where without FWA, part-time work would be the only option.  History  The idea came from German management consultant, Christel Kammerer in West Germany (1960). It was first implemented by German Aerospace firm, Messarschmilt-Boklow-Blohm in 1967. It was not until the 1970's that FWA practices began in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

FWA also has the ability to encourage men to play a care-giving role as they have equal access to the program. = Access considerations = FWA tend to favour those in full-time, salaried positions and male-dominated workplaces or industries. While in the male-dominated workplace, there seems to be equitable access, in female-dominated workplaces, both the women and men are less likely to have schedule control. It is argued this is due to female-dominated workplaces having low-paying roles and unfavourable working conditions. = Policy implications = -Based on the access considerations, it is argued that the group whom most needs FWA, may not be able to get access to it. -FWA is important as it is attributed as a variable to help close the Gender pay gap and can assist in maintaining a women's labour market position after giving birth. -Further research is being conducted by the European Commission (2017), which seeks to identify why an employer may reject a request for a FWA. -Flexibility can be seen as a substitute as compensation.  Current policy  = Canada = * Budget Implementation Act, 2017, No. 2 (Bill C-63): Amendments made to the Canada Labour Code to give federal employees the right to ask for a FWA. * No private sector legislation = United Kingdom = * All employees have the right to make a statutory application *Under the contracts of employment and working hours legislation: **All employees are eligible to flexible working should they have the same employer for 26 weeks or more = United States = * In 2010, the government passed the Telework Enhancement Act for Federal employees. * As of 2017, the following FWA bills have been proposed: **Workflex in the 21st Century Act: Allows employers to choose to offer employers a given number of paid days leave and FWAs. Employers who choose to do this would be rewarded via exemption from local and state bank days. This bill has some controversy as critics feel it would transfer more employee control over to the employer. **Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017 [H.R. 1180]: Enhancement to the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2015 [S.233] by adding a 'time off in lieu' amendment. Critics feel flexibility would be substitute compensation, which comes at the employees expense. **Schedules That Work Act and Flexibility for Working Families Act of 2017: These acts would give people the right to request FWA.

They are Apple's higher-end wireless earbuds, sold alongside AirPods. AirPods Pro use the same H1 chip found in second generation AirPods, but add active noise cancellation, automated frequency profile setting, IPX4 water resistance, a charging case with wireless charging, and interchangeable silicone tips. Overview Apple announced AirPods Pro on October 28, 2019, and released them two days later on October 30, 2019. They include features of standard AirPods, such as a microphone that filters out background noise, accelerometers and optical sensors that can detect presses on the stem and in-ear placement, and automatic pausing when they are taken out of the ears. Control by tapping is replaced by pressing a force sensor on the stems. They are rated IPX4 for water resistance. The AirPods Pro use the same H1 chip found in second generation AirPods that supports hands-free \\"Hey Siri\\". They have active noise cancellation, accomplished by microphones detecting outside sound and speakers producing precisely opposite \\"anti-noise\\". Active noise cancellation can be turned off or switched to \\"transparency mode\\" that helps users hear surroundings. Noise cancellation modes can also be switched in iOS or by pinching the stems of the AirPods using a new \\"force sensor\\". Battery life is equal to the 2nd generation AirPods at five hours, but noise cancellation or transparency mode reduce it to 4.5 hours due to the extra processing. The charging case advertises the same 24 hours of total listening time as the standard AirPods case. It also features Qi standard wireless charging compatibility. Like AirPods, AirPods Pro have received criticism for their battery life. AirPods Pro come with three sizes of silicone tips. There is a software test in iOS called the Ear Tip Fit Test that \\"[checks] the fit of your AirPods ear tips to determine which size provides the best seal and acoustic performance\\" to ensure a correct fit, as well as a feature called \\"Adaptive EQ\\" which automatically adjusts the frequency contour, claimed to better match the wearer's ear shape. Starting in early 2020, Apple started selling tip replacements for AirPods Pro on their website. With iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, Apple added a spatial audio mode designed to simulate 5.1 surround sound. Supported apps include Apple TV+, Disney+ and HBO Max. Spatial audio requires an iPhone or iPad with an Apple A10 processor or newer. Firmware issues Users have complained that firmware version 2C54 (released December 2019) reduced the effectiveness of the active noise cancellation feature. After the release of 2C54, users speculated that the launch firmware with the strong noise cancellation (that received great reviews from the media) may have degraded the lifespan of the product, and Apple had to weaken the noise cancelling feature in order to preserve the lifespan of the hardware. Compatibility Support for AirPods Pro was added in iOS 13.2, watchOS 6.1, tvOS 13.2, and macOS Catalina 10.15.1. They are compatible with any device that supports Bluetooth, including Windows and Android devices, although certain features such as automatic switching between devices are only available on Apple devices using its iCloud service.

During its existence, the nightclub was the favorite topic of magazines and daily newspapers because of countless happenings, drug stories and its psychedelic light projections. The British Path√© described the club as being \\"the hottest and most expensive happening center in West Germany. It's wild, it's way-out, it's with it, it's got everything.\\"  History and Description  The nightclub was founded in 1967 by the Samy brothers in a former cinema that had been erected in 1926 in Munich's Schwabing district. The brothers Temur and Anusch Samy (called \\"The kings of the flower power era in Schwabing\\"), who were of Iranian descent and the first concept- and event gastronomers in Germany, founded a business empire including several nightclubs, pubs, restaurants, underground bars, a brewery, a shopping center called Citta 2000 and a cab company, and were described by contemporary witnesses and business partners as trendsetters who established a whole new kind of gastronomy trade in Munich that changed all of the city. Blow Up, their masterpiece, had multiple levels and platforms on which the bands could play and the go-go girls dance, as well as gangways from which the guests could reach the different levels and watch the main dancefloor, which was \\"bombarded\\" by the flashes of 250 stage lights and light projectors. One of the innovations was that the stage lights reacted to the rhythm of the music, which marked the beginning of synchronized light shows in discotheques. The Samy brothers invested 850,000 German marks just for the installations of the club. Already the opening party, which was covered broadly by the media, made the Blow Up a national sensation. Up to 5,000 people tried to squeeze into the building, and only 1,600 tickets had been sold until the pressure of the throng could no longer to be withstood and the crowd stormed the building. 3,500 people made it in, thousand more than officially allowed. In this general turmoil, men in smoking overthrew the box office and pinched a stack of receipts, a prominent PR consultant got his glasses beaten out of his face, and a young man took possession of the microphone, praised Rudi Dutschke and accused the Federal Republic of Germany of economic exploitation. Others pulled down the iron railings or painted professions of sympathy for the Viet Cong onto the walls. These actions were partly tolerated, as the club owner Anusch Samy regarded the place as an \\"action center\\", which included \\"the participance of the audience\\" and that things that were knocked over or painted by the crowd should not be restored. The premiere event featured the London soul band Robert Hirst and The Big Taste the DJ Dave Lee Travis of Radio Caroline, the Gerhard-Wilson go-go girls from Paris, psychedelic light projections and a wild \\"paint-in\\", where participants threw pounds of paint at each other. In the meantime, hundreds of cars of visitors around the nightclub were fined for parking illegally. The legendary first night in the Blow Up ended with a tear gas attack which drove the crowd to a hasty departure. In the following years the nightclub was the favorite topic of magazines and daily newspapers because of countless way-out happenings such as paint-ins, wet pool parties on the dancefloor, film screenings or \\"multimedia discos\\", the drug stories around the nightclub, its psychedelic light projections, as well as the high-profile artist bookings. Artists who performed at the Blow Up include world stars such as Jimi Hendrix (who gave his first live performances in Germany at the Blow Up), Pink Floyd, Yes, Sammy Davis Jr., Bill Haley, Amon D√º√ºl, Julie Driscoll Tippetts or Brian Auger. The nightclub also was in the headlines because of further highlights such as the visit of novelist G√ºnter Grass, who gave readings between go-go girls, visits by the communards Fritz Teufel, Uschi Obermaier and Rainer Langhans, the later RAF terrorist Andreas Baader, and by other celebs such as actress Uschi Glas, Peter Kraus, Gunter Sachs or Prince Johannes of Thurn and Taxis. In 1970, club owner Anusch Samy died in a pane crash close to St. Moritz. Following his dead, his brother Temur did not manage to keep the party empire together, and \\"Munich's biggest beat sensation\\" had to close in 1972. A supermarket chain planned to move into the building, which could be prevented by a civic movement. Eventually the city of Munich bought the building, which since 1993 houses a theater called Schauburg.

Overview Mahia (ŸÖÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑÿ≠Ÿäÿßÿ©) is a traditional Moroccan Jewish brandy distillates from fruits such as jujubes, figs, dates, grapes, and flavored with anise. Its name literally means \\"eau de vie\\" in Arabic. Originally from Morocco, it was historically produced by the Moroccan Jews before they emigrated in the second half of the 20th century. Mahia can be enjoyed as a digestif or used as a base for cocktails: it goes very well with pomegranate juice, rose water; ginger syrup or mango juice for example. It can also be infused with fennel leaves, to enhance its aniseed scent. Today, mahia very often designates adulterated alcohol in Morocco sold informally and consumed in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Even in present-day Morocco it is still traditionally associated with Morocco's Jewish community.

A bago is a traditional boat built by the Mandar people of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The hull is of the pajala-type, lightly built and allowing for shallow displacement. The boat is long, with the mast only making up a quarter of its length. A bago can be readily identified as Mandarese boat by its rudderpost style. Smaller-sized bagos are often used as fishing boats from which fishermen cast their nets. The Mandar people prefer using a bago over an outrigger canoe.Horridge. (1983). p.53. Fishermen at the beach of Galesong, tending to their bago and net. c. 1945‚Äì1955. In the present, small bagos are outfitted with a leti (lete) sail/rig, but not long ago, they had canted rectangular sails (tanja rig). Bigger versions of the bago, also using the pajala-type hull, are sometimes built rather deep and round but without the angle at the end of the keel. These boats can be found all over Mandar coast. A type with nade sail, created the West Sulawesian lambo. Another type, with leti sail and Mandar-style flat-roofed deckhouse, may be mistaken as leti leti. There is not much difference between the two except in the pattern of the placement of the planks and other details that give the characteristics of each manufacturing place of the boat.

Background  From 1964-1971, Don Williams formed and played with the band the Pozo Seco Singers. In 1966, the band signed with Columbia Records, due to the strength of their first single, \\"Time\\". Williams left the band in 1971, and moved to Nashville, where he met producer and writer, Allen Reynolds, who introduced Williams to country singer and businessman Jack Clement, who had just founded JMI Records. Williams was soon signed to JMI records, and Reynolds would go on to produce and write on Williams' next two albums. Initially a songwriters demo was recorded to sell Williams' songs to other artists. However, when there wasn't a strong initial response, it was decided to record and release a full length album.

Tillson was a Girl Scout. She attended Pennsylvania State College, enrolled in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences as a metallurgy major. She was the first woman to complete that course at Penn State, when her degree was granted in 1938.  Career  After college, with her husband Russell Filer, she founded the Mineral of the Month Club, sending mineralogical samples to schools and libraries, with concise information sheets to help educators, students, and collectors learn more about minerals. They also ran a mineral shop in Redlands, California, and specialty bookshop in Yucaipa, California, Geoscience Books & Prints. In 1984, Filer was elected first president of the Geo-Literary Society at a Tucson meeting; the society was intended to gather those interested in \\"books, maps, drawings and related printed matter\\" about minerals, gems, and fossils. Filer amassed a comprehensive collection of over three thousand Western stock certificates over thirty years; images of the certificates have been published for research purposes in recent years.  Personal life  Alexandra Tillson married twice. In 1938 she married a fellow Penn State student, James Alonzo Taylor. She met geologist Russell Filer in California; they married in 1956. As of 2014, they were retired and living in Yucaipa, California. Her older brother Benjamin Franklin Tillson Jr. died in 2011, at age 96; Alexandra Filer and another sister, Diana R. Tillson, were mentioned as his survivors in an obituary.

Released in January of 1974 on the JMI Records label, the album reached number thirteen on the US Country Albums Chart. \\"Atta Way to Go\\" was released in 1973 as a single preceding the album, and \\"We Should Be Together\\" and \\"Down the Road I Go\\" were released as singles in 1974.  Background  Williams was no stranger to the country music scene, having been a member of the Texas band The Pozo Seco Singers from 1964-1970. He left the music industry briefly, but returned in 1973 with his solo debut, Don Williams Volume One. Williams had signed with JMI records initially as a songwriter, but later at the encouragement of its founder, Jack Clement, recorded a full length album produced by songwriter Allen Reynolds. It was a strong debut, reaching number five on the 1973 Country Albums Chart, and it had two top 20 country singles. Six months after the release of his debut album, the formula for success was repeated for Don Williams Volume Two, including producer Allen Reynolds, and many of the same A-Team Nashville studio musicians, notably steel guitarist Lloyd Green, fiddle player Buddy Spicher and drummer Kenny Malone.  Legacy  This would be Williams' final recording with JMI records, which was sold to ABC-DOT Records shortly after the release of the album. Allen Reynolds would go on to produce and write many successful country songs, including many of Crystal Gayle's biggest hits from the 1970s and 1980s. The song \\"We Should Be Together,\\" written by Reynolds, would go on to be the title track off of Gayle's 1976 country record.

They are generally round-hulled and powered by rowers or sails made from woven pandanus leaves. They have several variants based on size and island of origin. The term \\"tataya\\" can also be used for all traditional boats in the Batanes Islands in general, similar to the term bangka in the rest of the Philippines. Types =Size= The following are the traditional types of tataya based on size: *Suhuan - also known as pangdayan or karakuhan, are the largest types of tataya. They are around long, wide, and deep. They can carry two rowers and one tiller, as well as an additional eight passengers. *Pehan - shorter than the suhuan but proportionally wider. It has two pairs of thole pins (pasitan) for rowers. It is around to wide and deep. *Paychanavangan - a small tataya used for hook and line fishing. It can carry two people, but is usually only manned by one. It is in length and in width. *Paychatanian - a single-person tatayan. It is long, wide, and deep. *Dinong - also known as viyung. A single-person tataya made from a single dugout canoe. It is around long, wide, and deep. =Region= Batan The tataya of Batan Island are generally divided into three types: the Basco and Mahato tataya, the Ivana tataya, and the Uyugan tataya. Basco and Mahatao tataya share the same fishing grounds and thus are identical in construction. The boats are rounded with thin ribs (lagkaw) and four strakes (tavas) at the sides, including the topmost strake, the pamekpekan. The prow is raised higher than the rest of the boat. Ivana tataya are built for maneuverability. Sitting slightly lower than Uyugan tataya. The ribs are squared and thin, while the keel (managad) and the lowest strakes (manpid) are carved from a single log. It does not have a plank-sheer (sintas) unlike other tataya. Uyugan tataya are heavier than the other tataya. They are shorter than the Basco and Mahatao tataya. They sit higher than Sabtang and Ivana tataya on the water. The strakes are thick and they have an open side. Itbayat Tataya from the island of Itbayat are built for stability due to the rougher waters around the island. They have a wide body and a flat bottom. They have five strakes. The prow and the stern are also characteristically rounded, unlike those of other tataya which are pointed. It is the only type of tataya with outriggers (patid), which is generally reserved for the larger types of Ivatan boats. Other tataya do not have outriggers. Sabtang Tataya from the island of Sabtang have very shallow and pointed sterns. The thole pins are fastened to a third-tier plank (pinatapid) attached to the topmost strake (pamekpekan).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is a single-story frame house with a truncated hip roof. It was deemed, in its Utah State Historical Society document, to be \\"architecturally significant as one of only five well preserved examples of a variant of the pyramid house. The pyramid house is one of the three most common house types built during the early period of Park City's mining boom era and was built with a number of variations. This one is characterized by the typical square form and a hip roof, but is distinguished from the basic pyramid house in that instead of having a porch spanning the facade, the porch is set into a recessed section of the facade.\\" The document goes on to say: \\"Instead of having a porch spanning a symmetrical facade, as was the typical facade arrangement of a pyramid house, the northwest corner was recessed to form a small front porch. The porch spans half of the facade, which consists of a door and a window. It is supported on lathe turned piers which have decorative brackets at the tops, and the balustrade has a geometric design. This type of balustrade was a popular element of the Victorian period, but there are few extant examples of the type in Park City. Because porch elements are the first to deteriorate and be replaced, it is difficult to determine if indeed this type of decoration was common in the area.\\" The house was built for Levins D. and Stella Gray, who bought the property in October, 1901. It was in an area being rebuilt, after a \\"great fire of 1898.\\" It is not known if they lived there or rented it out, before they sold it in 1909.

The station aired programming aimed at the African American community in central Iowa. The station was on air from 1981 until 1998; its license renewal was successfully challenged in a seven-year legal battle that dragged on for most of the 1990s over an unauthorized two-year silence period and the illegal presence of a convicted felon as an officer of the station's licensee. A new minority station, KJMC, went on the air in 1999 as a result of a competing application to the license renewal. History =Early years and tower site fight= In 1976, a Human Rights Commission task force determined that Des Moines media was not adequately meeting the needs of the city's minority residents; according to one study, its existing radio stations presented fewer than 10 hours a week of minority-oriented programming. The effort to build a minority radio station was spearheaded by Charles Knox, a former head of the local Black Panther Party, and Joeanna Cheatom, who would be described as the founder of KUCB. Also involved in founding the station was Edna Griffin, who in 1948 had protested the refusal of the Katz Drug Store lunch counter downtown to serve blacks. On December 30, 1977, the Center for the Study of Black Theology applied to build a new noncommercial educational radio station at 89.3 in Des Moines. The center's application was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on February 26, 1979. However, that same year, the station's first efforts to get on air were frustrated by internal strife, which prompted the group to return much of a grant it had received for staff. The center, also known as Urban Community Broadcasting, received a $25,000 grant from the city of Des Moines in 1980 to help put the station on the air. At the time, the only Black media in Des Moines was a tabloid newspaper known as the Iowa Bystander. Before even going on air with a permanent facility, KUCB-FM attracted controversy in Des Moines. It had proposed initially to place its tower atop the Financial Center downtown. However, the station eventually filed to build a tower in a residential area at the Gateway Center, a community center located at 801 Forest Avenue. (It went on the air August 1, 1981, from a temporary facility attached to a chimney.) This prompted local residents to oppose the project because it took away an outdoor basketball court and they feared electrical interference. The case reached the Des Moines Zoning Board of Adjustment on August 18; after the board denied Urban Community Broadcasting's request for a variance to build KUCB-FM by a 3‚Äì2 vote, station advisory board chair Kalonji Saadiq hurled a wastebasket toward the chairman of the board, narrowly missing him; Saadiq, angry at what he perceived as the denial of 20,000 black citizens, called the board \\"trash\\". (Saadiq, another former Black Panther who later hosted a talk show on KUCB and rose to the post of station manager, was no stranger to Des Moines city politics; he ran for Congress with the Socialist Party in 1980 and mounted a campaign for mayor of Des Moines in 1983.) The editorial board of the Des Moines Tribune wrote that the zoning board had made an improper decision in denying the tower application. The Center for the Study and Application of Black Economic Development‚Äîas KUCB-FM's licensee became known‚Äîappealed the city decision to the Polk County District Court, which issued a default judgment in favor of the radio station, though the city vowed to appeal. The same judge reaffirmed the judgment two weeks later. The tower site was not the only source of turmoil in KUCB-FM's first months on air‚Äîthe station went through three managers in 1981 alone‚Äîbut KUCB-FM was able to begin regular broadcasting. The station broadcast 20 hours a day on weekdays (21 on weekends); its output included gospel, jazz and reggae music, church services and talk shows. KUCB quickly became a pillar of the local community; its job ads helped the city implement its affirmative action program, while the station worked to defuse racial tension stemming from a series of police incidents in 1982. In 1983, it relocated from the Gateway Center‚Äîpart of which was boarded up‚Äîto newer and larger space at 1430 University Avenue. The station received a $20,000 grant from the Des Moines city council in January 1984 over the objections of an atheist activist who opposed the subsidy of a gospel music outlet. =KUCB in the mid-1980s= Joeanna Cheatom, KUCB-FM's founder, died on April 27, 1984; the station suspended its regular programming the next day and played gospel music in tribute. At this time, the first signs of potential financial trouble appeared. That August, Charles Knox had to deny rumors that the federal government was seeking to force KUCB-FM off the air, though he did admit that the station was being audited over the original 1970s grant from the Central Iowa Regional Association of Local Governments (CIRALG). However, the station was making other progress; at the same time, Knox announced the receipt of a $72,000 Department of Commerce grant to add new equipment and begin stereo operations. A 1984 Iowa Public Television documentary, Black Frequencies, profiled the state's three African American radio stations: KUCB-FM, KOJC in Cedar Rapids, and KBBG in Waterloo. The station continued its community service efforts, including non-alcoholic, drug-free parties that were the brainchild of three DJs. The winter of 1985‚Äì1986 brought with it new technical troubles. The cold weather caused a malfunction in KUCB-FM's transmitter that caused it to broadcast as much as 600 kHz off its assigned frequency, interfering with classical music outlet WOI-FM 90.1 and high school station KWDM 88.9. The situation was so bad some listeners of KUCB thought it was off the air, while interference complaints piled up from WOI-FM's listeners. WOI offered engineering support to fix the problem, but it could not get KUCB to reply to its overtures. =Plunge into silence= Internal turmoil dominated KUCB-FM in 1986. That July, station manager Al Saladin was dismissed for broadcasting speeches of Louis Farrakhan on the station and not bringing in enough fundraising revenue. First vice president Iris \\"Sissy\\" Ward, Cheatom's daughter, said of Saladin, \\"He was supposed to be writing grant proposals, but he didn't want to take money from white folks.\\" The station raised $3,000 from an emergency radiothon, enough to stay afloat for another month, but its broadcasts had become intermittent. In November, Jamal Akil (aka Jamal Long), who had been on the KUCB-FM board since the station signed on, resigned, claiming that under Ward, white people had too much influence on the operation of the radio station in such actions as the removal of Farrakhan's preaching, the reduction of gospel music in the station's broadcast day, and the discontinuation of its prayer hotline. Akil claimed that founder Joeanna Cheatom would have disapproved of these changes. Ward defended the changes as recommended and necessary to keep the station operational, said that Saladin's \\"blacks only\\" separatist line had hurt it, and stated that she wanted to evolve KUCB along the lines of a public radio station. Adding to the station's troubles was the discovery in December 1986 that KUCB-FM still did not have the license to cover its construction permit; it had, however, filed for the license in October 1984. The next month, Ward and board chairman William Talbert were removed by the KUCB board, while Akil had returned as a show host and many of Ward's changes were reverted. Behind the new course of action for the station was Charles Knox, whose legal problems were becoming relevant to KUCB-FM's future; by January 1987, he was awaiting trial in a Chicago federal court on charges of selling arms to Libya. Two months later, he was convicted as posing as one of his co-defendant's attorneys to visit him in prison, while testimony in the arms case revealed that Knox and two other conspirators associated with the El Rukn street gang traveled to Libya and made an offer to Muammar Gaddafi to commit terrorist acts in the United States in exchange for $2 million. In April, new general manager Ako Abdul-Samad said that despite being the chairman of the board of directors of Urban Community Broadcasting, the Knox conviction would not impact KUCB, as he had no hand in the day-to-day decision making at the station. The station also sought money to pay operational expenses and had repaired remote control and Emergency Broadcast System equipment (which it had at one point lacked) to help keep it within FCC regulations; it also added a talk show for Hispanics and a legal advice program. However, by May 1987, KUCB-FM had gone off the air, mired in financial troubles and having suffered damage to its transmitter. The revolving door of leadership spun once again: a new administrative assistant-general manager, Lorenzo Creighton, was appointed in July by Charles Knox‚Äîwho still bore the role of station president‚Äîto restore order to the station's distressed finances. Creighton replaced Samad and was the radio station's third general manager in seven months. One group appeared late in the year in the effort to return KUCB-FM to operational status: Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), which desired to provide assistance but could not get in touch with Urban Community Broadcasting officials to make the offer, or indeed, find someone who could speak for the embattled and silent station, as Iris Ward was still the president in state records. The group estimated that it would take $35,000 to restore KUCB to the air, including $20,000 to replace the transmitter and the payment of $6,700 in FCC fines. After more than two and a half years off the air, KUCB-FM returned in December 1989 with a limited schedule of programming, operating just seven hours on weekdays (and from 6 a.m. to midnight on weekends) with an all-volunteer staff. =License renewal fight= The KCCI weather beacon tower (seen in 2008) was KUCB-FM's final transmitter site While KUCB had survived to broadcast into the 1990s, it had done so without notifying the Federal Communications Commission of its lengthy silence. The first word the FCC had of the station being silent was a September 1987 letter from Commonwealth Electric Company, which was trying to locate the person responsible for the silent station. On January 8, 1990, the FCC ordered KUCB- FM to show cause why its license should not be revoked for leaving the air without the requisite authorization. In fact, KUCB-FM had been off air the entire time since finally receiving a license in June 1988. When FCC representatives visited the studio site in March and April 1989, they found it abandoned, and the second time they did so, the power had been disconnected. The FCC also proposed a fine of up to $20,000. The station did manage a major technical improvement in 1990 when its transmitter was relocated to the KCCI TV weather beacon tower in downtown Des Moines. By this time, KUCB-FM had settled in at the offices of nonprofit organization Urban Dreams; its executive director, future Iowa state representative Wayne Ford, also was the radio station's president. Ford, who had previously been a talk show host on the station until he endorsed Walter Mondale on air in 1984, rejoined the station on one condition: that Charles Knox be removed. Its programming remained much the same, though it had a Tuesday night block of Hispanic programs. In 1991, the KUCB-FM revocation proceeding was converted into a serious renewal battle when the FCC designated the license for hearing opposite rival bids‚Äîone led by ACORN and another headed by KDMI radio personality Larry Nevilles‚Äîboth promising minority-oriented programming. In designating the applications for comparative hearing, the FCC pointed not only to the silence and technical issues but also to Knox's criminal record and the station's failure to disclose it in the renewal application. That record, in addition to the Libya case, also included facts directly related to KUCB: Knox had embezzled $31,000 of the $72,000 Department of Commerce grant issued in 1984, diverting it in 1985 and 1986 to an automotive company in Chicago. ACORN called a press conference in November 1991 in an attempt to say that it was not a hostile challenger for KUCB-FM's frequency, but the event turned confrontational when ACORN officials called police to have station manager Kalonji Saadiq and others barred from the room. Station officials claimed that the other competing applicant‚ÄîMinority Communications, headed by Nevilles‚Äîwould in actuality run a Christian radio station, citing Nevilles's position as a DJ at KDMI, which broadcast religious programming. They also said that the real reason for the competing challenges was the Muslim influence at KUCB-FM; the station had returned to broadcasting Louis Farrakhan's speeches, something that ACORN president Pauline Green wanted to bring to an end. One bright spot for the station took place in 1992, when Dorothy Gladden, host of the Gospel Train program, married Byron Moore, who hosted The Blues Train on KUCB-FM, after Moore proposed to Gladden on the air. KUCB-FM's license defense got off to an inauspicious start in early 1992 when it missed a hearing and its lawyer, Alfredo Parrish, called the FCC meeting a \\"waste of time\\"; the station said it was not aware he needed to appear in person in Washington instead of telephonically. In testimony that August, Abdul-Samad and Long claimed that KUCB-FM had been sabotaged throughout its time off air and after a falling out with Nevilles, who criticized the station within the Des Moines black community. Their memories were not as clear as to when they learned of Knox's felon status and whether documents sent to the FCC about the station's ownership were accurate. Lawyers for the FCC argued that KUCB-FM had broadcast appeals for Knox's legal defense fund and had discussed his conviction on a station call-in show. On March 26, 1993, FCC administrative law judge Richard Sippel ruled that KUCB-FM's license renewal should be denied and that Minority Communications should be awarded the frequency. He found that the Center for the Study and Application of Black Economic Development should be disqualified for willfully intending to deceive the FCC about its knowledge of Knox's felony and for the unapproved silence of KUCB-FM, and that ACORN was financially unqualified to be the licensee. KUCB's principals claimed Sippel's findings were \\"totally incorrect\\" and constituted \\"political persecution\\" by groups such as the government and local police who were opponents of the station. KUCB's presence in the community continued to be somewhat polarized. A representative for city police officers, who had complained of \\"anti-police\\" comments on the station's air, said that they were \\"glad\\" to hear of the ruling. Another group that had found negative comments on KUCB's air was the local Jewish community: the president of the Jewish Community Relations Committee had declined several invitations to appear on the station over a radio show it aired that claimed that Jews had conspired to bomb the World Trade Center and blame Muslims. However, its supporters pointed to stories the station had broken‚Äîsuch as Pizza Hut's refusal to deliver to some inner-city areas‚Äîand the station's charitable efforts and sponsorship of rap concerts. Looking back, a 2004 Des Moines Register story credited KUCB for introducing many central Iowans to hip-hop music. KUCB-FM lost its first appeal, to the FCC Review Board, in February 1995; the board affirmed the ALJ's finding and the grant to Minority Communications. KUCB, and its lawyer Parrish, announced their intention to appeal to the full commission. The FCC rejected the appeal in February 1996. With the station's options at the commission exhausted, KUCB lawyer Alfredo Parrish appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleging that administrative law judge Sippel was \\"prejudiced\\" and the FCC was ignoring its own policies to promote minority radio ownership. After losing at the D.C. Circuit and in its bid to be heard at the Supreme Court, the 89.3 frequency finally fell silent in the summer of 1998. The new Minority Communications station took the call letters KJMC and began test broadcasts in March 1999. =Post-license pirate operations= Even though KUCB-FM ceased operations at 89.3, it still maintained control of all of its studio and broadcasting equipment.

It is a low, straggling shrub with hairy, egg-shaped leaves and purple to mauve flowers. Description Prostanthera junonis is a low, straggling, almost prostrate shrub that typically grows to a height of , is not aromatic, and has branches covered with long hairs. The leaves are dull green above, paler below, narrow egg-shaped to narrow elliptical, often appearing triangular to linear when the edges are turned downwards, long and wide on a petiole about long. The flowers are arranged in groups of four to fourteen upper leaf axils on the branchlets on a pedicel long. The sepals are green with a maroon tinge, long, forming a tube long with two lobes long. The sepals are usually slightly hairy and enlarge slightly by the fruiting stage. The petals are pale purple to mauve or almost white and long with two lips. The central lobe of the lower lip is spatula-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are long and wide. The upper lip is long and wide with two lobes. Flowering mainly occurs from October to February. Taxonomy Prostanthera junonis was first formally described in 1997 by Barry Conn in the journal Telopea from material collected near Somersby in 1993. The Binomial nomenclature (junonis) honours Mrs June Gay. Distribution and habitat Somersby mintbush grows in sclerophyll forest and woodland in sandy loamy soils on sandstone, in the Mangrove Mountain and Sydney districts on the Central Coast of New South Wales. Conservation status This mintbush is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 and a recovery plant has been prepared. The main threats to the species include habitat loss and degradation due to agriculture, hazard reduction burns, weed invasion, and stormwater runoff.

According to the pseudonymous narrative, the Surb Karapet Monastery of Innaknean \\"collapsed in ruins\\" due to the earthquake, along with the houses located below it. The narrative claims that the monastery's foundations were standing in the earthquake's area. The earthquake caused a shift in the foundations, resulting in the monastery's collapse. The Surb Karapet Monastery (Karapeti vank') was also known as the \\"convent of the nine springs\\" (Innakneani vank'). It was located on Mount Bazmasar, which has an altitude of . The mountain is located to the northwest of the modern city of Mu≈ü. The monastery served as the religious centre for Taron, and it was a pilgrimage site for Armenians. In the present era, the monastery stands in ruins. It had been reconstructed on several occasions, and its architectural history is known in detail only from the 15th century onwards. Among the still extantr buildings, the oldest date to the 7th or 8th century. The earthquake probably destroyed an early incarnation of the monastery. Pseudo-John Mamikonean dates the earthquake to the first regnal year of the Byzantine emperor Phocas (reigned 602-610). The geologist Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich (19th century) mentions two different earthquakes in the area of the monastery, one dated to 593 and the other to 606. Abich's primary source for both events was the chronicle of Samuel Anetsi (12th century). The historian Michael the Syrian (12th century) vaguely mentions one or more earthquakes affecting the eastern areas of the Byzantine Empire during this period. While modern historians have suggested that Michael was referring to the 602 earthquake, he might have instead misdated events of the 632 Armenia earthquake.

It is linked to the right to work and historical movements for legal limitations on working hours. Today, the right to rest and leisure is recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in many regional texts such as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child.  History  The movement for a recognised right to rest and leisure can be traced back to the 19th century and the eight-hour day movement. As early as 1856, stonemasons working at the University of Melbourne in Australia put down their tools until demands for reduced working hours were accepted. The ensuing guarantee of a maximum 8-hour workday is one of the earliest examples of a legal protection against too much work, which today we recognise as the right to rest and leisure. The motto of the Australian Stonemasons in 1856 was as follows: Whilst Australia was one of the earliest countries to enjoy universal working hour limitations (an implied right to leisure), throughout the 20th century many other countries began to pass similar laws limiting the number of hours one can work.  Definition  The modern notion of a right to rest and leisure is recognised in article 24 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognises in part IV, Article 7: The Right to Leisure has also been recognised in article 31 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and article 12 of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, both recognising the: The Right to Leisure is considered an economic, cultural and social right, as opposed to a civil and political right. The right to rest and leisure is connected to the right to work, which is provided for by Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and article 6.3 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Where the right to work provides a right to work, the right to rest and leisure protects individuals from too much work. The Committee on Economic, Cultural, and Social Rights has made no general comment on article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Therefore, there is no universal agreement on the specific obligations of states in relation to the right to rest and leisure, and ‚Äúno common conception of these terms that may be formally assumed‚Äù.David Richards and Benjamin Carbonetti, ‚ÄúWorth what we decide: a defense of the right to Leisure,‚Äù International Journal of Human Rights, vo. 17, no. 3, (2013): 331. Nonetheless, states do still have responsibilities in relation to the right to rest and leisure  State obligations on the right to rest and leisure  Despite the ambiguous language of article 24 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, States do have obligations and responsibilities in relation to the right to leisure. The body of texts published by the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights has established that in relation to all rights, including the right to rest and leisure, States have an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil. = Respect, protect and fulfil = The respect, protect and fulfil principle constitutes the core state obligation in relation to economic, cultural and social rights, including the right to leisure: Based on the definition of respect, protect and fulfil principle outlined in the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights‚Äô general comment No. 14, the obligation to respect requires States to refrain from interfering directly or indirectly with the enjoyment of the right to leisure. The obligation to protect requires States to take measures that prevent third parties from interfering with the right to leisure. Finally, the obligation to fulfil requires States to adopt appropriate legislative, administrative, budgetary, judicial, promotional and other measures towards the realisation and enjoyment of the right to leisure. Therefore, states must not only respect and protect individuals from too much work, but must also fulfil the right, and ensure that individuals have the capacity to positively enjoy their right to leisure, and not simply be in the absence of too much work.  Criticism  The right to rest and leisure, like many economic, social, and cultural rights, has often been considered less important or fundamental than civil and political rights. Critiques of economic, social, and cultural rights such as Maurice Cranston and Aryeh Neier, or William Talbott‚Äôs Which Rights Should be Universal,William Talbott, Which Rights Should be Universal. Oxford. Oxford University Press. 2005 often argue that ESCR are unnecessary for human dignity, are less fundamental than civil and political rights, are too expensive and impractical, and that some constituencies of humans are undeserving of ESCR.David Richards and Benjamin Carbonetti, ‚ÄúWorth what we decide: a defense of the right to Leisure,‚Äù International Journal of Human Rights, vo. 17, no. 3, (2013): 331. However, human rights scholars are increasingly embracing the concept of indivisibility and acknowledging that all human rights are fundamental.Richard McGrath, Janette Young, and Caroline Adams, ‚Äòleisure as a human right special edition introduction,‚Äô Annals of Leisure Research, vol. 20, no. 3, (2017): p. 314. Defenders of the right to rest and leisure claim that it is of fundamental importance to well-being once basic security has been assured, and that leisure is ‚Äúnot an idle waste of time or mere absence from work, but, rather, necessary for a life of dignity‚Äù.David Richards and Benjamin Carbonetti, ‚ÄúWorth what we decide: a defense of the right to Leisure,‚Äù International Journal of Human Rights, vo. 17, no. 3, (2013): 334. The right to rest and leisure is an emerging human right, and debates around its importance and implementability are likely to be ongoing.

In 1924 he joined the Brosa String Quartet playing second violin. From 1930 until 1934 he was a music director for C. B. Cochran on London productions such as Jerome Kern's The Cat and the Fiddle (March 1932, 219 performances), Kern's Music in the Air (May 1933, 275 performances) and Cole Porter's Nymph Errant (October 1933, 154 performances).London Musicals, 1930-34 In the early 1930s he also joined Decca as a recording manager.Lloyd, Stephen. Constant Lanbert: Beyond The Rio Grande (2015) In 1936 Greenbaum founded the BBC Television Orchestra, which played on the inaugural programme broadcast when regular British television broadcasts commenced on 26 August 1936 to an estimated 123,000 viewers. This was the first high-definition standard (405 lines) television test transmission, with the orchestra broadcasting from Alexandra Palace to the Radiolympia exhibition being held at Olympia London. The orchestra also played on the opening day of BBC Television high-definition broadcast on 2 November 1936.The History of the BBC Its repertoire was wide, ranging from music for drama productions through to a televised adaptation of Tristan und Isolde (in two one-hour sections) on 24 January 1938.Radio Tines, Issue 747, 23 January 1938, p 16 Greenbaum, with a group of others at the BBC (including Stephen Thomas, Dallas Bower, Desmond Davis and members of the British Music Drama Opera Company), presented 29 operas on television between 1936 and 1939.Salter, Lionel and others: 'Television' in Grove Music Online The orchestra was disbanded in September 1939 at the outbreak of World War II when the BBC's television service was suspended, after which Greenbaum used a nucleus of its players to form the BBC Revue Orchestra, playing light variety music for BBC radio from its base in Bangor, North Wales. However, he continued to conduct a wide range of repertoire for the BBC with other orchestras. For instance, on 19 November 1941 he conducted Franz Liszt's symphonic poem Orpheus and Ferruccio Busoni's Violin Concerto.Radio Times Issue 946, 16 November 1941, p 14  Composition and orchestration  Greenbaum was a member of the \\"Warlock Gang\\", followers of composer and music critic Peter Warlock (Philip Heseltine).Lloyd, Stephen (ed.). Music in Their Time: The Memoirs and Letters of Dora and Hubert Foss (2019) Others were Cecil Gray, E. J. Moeran, Constant Lambert and Leslie Heward. It has been suggested that Heseltine's influence led to Greenbaum's heavy drinking habit. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the London home of Hyam Greenbaum and his wife, the harpist Sidonie Goossens, became a regular meeting place for an expanded circle of hard-drinking musicians, also including Arnold Bax, Patrick Hadley, Spike Hughes, Alan Rawsthorne and William Walton. During the war they moved to Bristol, living with Rawsthorne and his wife Jessie Hinchcliffe at the Clifton Arts Club.'The Creel, Vol 8 No 2 (2016) p 3 This was bombed in November 1940, and many of Rawsthorne‚Äôs manuscripts were destroyed.

He is particularly well known for his fundamental and pioneering work on the mechanical and functional properties of ceramics. This includes his research work on the sintering behaviour of ceramics and the development of lead-free piezoceramics. Until then, lead-free piezo materials were considered impossible. Through meticulous research, he found the first lead-free systems with \\"Giant\\" elongation. In 2008, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, the highest award for German researchers, for his contributions to the development of ferroelectric functional ceramics, new lead-free piezoelectric ceramics and novel gradient materials.  Life  From 1977 to 1983, R√∂del studied materials science at the University of Erlangen and ceramics at the University of Leeds. R√∂del received his diploma in materials science from the University of Erlangen. In 1988, he received his Ph.D. in materials science from the University of California, Berkeley. In 1992, he habilitated in materials science at the TU Hamburg-Harburg. Since 1994 he has been professor of non-metallic inorganic materials at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.

According to German media recherches, the decision to help Frohnmeier and in return receive favours from him came directly from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Frohnmeier has denied the allegations, after the reports. Politicians from the Christian Democratic party have called Frohnmaier to step down after reports indicated, that he was working under the influence of the Kremlin. In March 2019, Frohnmaier became a member of the FSB Organizing Committee of the Yalta International Economic Forum (YIEF), an economic forum in the Crimea sponsored by the Russian Government.

The bedrock of the area consists almost wholly of a suite of sedimentary rocks deposited during the Devonian, a period named for the English county of Devon in which the western half of the park sits. The eastern part lies within Somerset and it is within this part of the park that limited outcrops of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks are to be found. Devonian Each of the individual sandstones and mudstones of Devonian age within the park are ascribed to the Exmoor Group. =Lynton Formation= The oldest strata (of Emsian to Eifelian age) are the slates and finely laminated sandstones of the Lynton Formation (traditionally known as the Lynton Slates or Lynton Beds) which are exposed along the coast in the Lynmouth area between Woody Bay and Countisbury Hill. They also extend west in the lowermost part of the cliffs as far as Ramsey Beach, near Heddon's Mouth. The Valley of Rocks is an abandoned valley carved into this formation west of Lynmouth. =Hangman Sandstone Formation= The Lynton Formation sandstones are overlain by those of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (traditionally the Hangman Grits) of Eifelian to Givetian age and which may be up to 2500m thick. This unit also includes some shales, mudstones, siltstones and conglomerates. These rocks are exposed along the entire coast east from Hangman Point to Woody Bay and again from Countisbury Hill to Porlock Weir. They also form the cliffed coast of North Hill, west of Minehead. The highest point on Exmoor, Dunkery Beacon, is formed from the Hangman Sandstone whilst Dunster Castle is built upon a spur of the same rock. =Ilfracombe Slates Formation= Next comes the Ilfracombe Slates Formation (earlier known as the Ilfracombe Beds) which is a succession of sandstones, slates and a fossiliferous limestone of Givetian to Frasnian age. The formation is subdivided into several ‚Äòmembers‚Äô of which the lowest (oldest) is the Wild Pear Slates (named for its occurrence at Wild Pear Beach), overlain by the Lester Slates and Sandstone (named for Lester Point and Cliff where it is exposed), then the Combe Martin Slates and finally the Kentisbury Slates which is the uppermost i.e. youngest part of the formation. The latter two are not exposed on the Exmoor coast but are to found within the park, in a strip of country east from Kentisbury. =Morte Slates Formation= The Ilfracombe Slates are overlain in turn by the Morte Slates Formation of Frasnian to Famennian age. Extending east from Challacombe, the slates provide much of the high ground south of the B3358 road through Simonsbath and Exford including Setta Barrow and form the Brendon Hills before extending to the easternmost extremity of the park at Elworthy. =Pickwell Down Sandstones, Upcott Slates and Baggy Sandstones formations= Sandstones and shales characterise the next unit which is the Pickwell Down Sandstones Formation (earlier known as the Pickwell Down Beds) which is of Famennian age. The Upcott Slates Formation, also of Famennian age, follows. The youngest Devonian rocks within the national park are sandstones, mudstones and siltstones of the overlying Baggy Sandstone Formation (earlier the Baggy and Marwood Beds), a small part of which is to be found within the park boundary just east of Brayford.http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/learning?a=116440 p4,5 Permo- Trias Unconformably overlying the Hangman Sandstone in the Porlock Basin is the Luccombe Breccia Formation, a presumed Permian age deposit consisting of calcareous breccia, sandstone and conglomerate which may be up to 650m thick. A further presumed unconformity separates the breccia from the mudstones of the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group which underlie the larger part of the low ground between Exmoor and North Hill. At the top of the group is a 25m thickness of mudstones with gypsum referred to as the Blue Anchor Formation. Above this are around 12m thickness of mudstones and limestone assigned to the Penarth Group. Lias A small outlier of largely Jurassic age Lias strata lies at the northern margin of the Porlock Basin up against the southwesterly down-throwing fault which marks the northeastern edge of this half-graben. Perhaps as much as a 100m thickness of the Blue Lias overlies the Penarth Group. The lowermost part of the Lias may be latest Triassic in age. In character it is grey mudstones and shales with thin limestones. Structure West of Porlock, the fold axis of the Lynton Anticline traces a curve beneath Culbone Hill, causing the Hangman Sandstones to dip moderately steeply to the north along the coastal strip. A series of broadly east‚Äìwest oriented folds affect the Hangman Sandstones at North Hill and south of Minehead. The Lynmouth-East Lyn Fault is a reverse or thrust fault dipping south at about 45 degrees which brings Lynton Slates over the Hangman Sandstones. Quaternary Exmoor was to the south of the ice-sheet during the last glacial period though it has been postulated that a small glacier may have occupied the anomalously deep feature on the north side of Winsford Hill known as the Punchbowl.Harrison,S. and Keen, D.H. in Lewis, C.A. and Richards, A.E. 2005 The glaciations of Wales and adjacent areas Logaston Press, Bristol During the earlier Anglian glaciation, the British ice-sheet extended as far south as the present day north coast of Somerset and Devon. Exmoor would have been subject to intense periglacial processes at this time and during other glacial periods. Tidal flat deposits occupy the low ground at Porlock, landward of which are river terraces and the modern day alluvial deposits associated with the Horner Water and its tributaries. Deposits of fragmentary rock material, the result of weathering and downslope movement of the underlying bedrock are known as ‚Äòhead‚Äô and are widely recorded within the valleys of the national park. A number of areas of peat are recorded on the upland surface of Exmoor. Small areas of talus (or scree) are found either side of Heddon Mouth. A variety of marine deposits are to be found along the shoreline including sand and cobbles whilst storm beach deposits are to be seen at Lynmouth.http://mapapps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyofbritain/home.html Mining Iron ore was formerly mined in the Brendon Hills where mineral-bearing lodes provided lens-shaped bodies of ore. The highest production levels were achieved in 1877 when almost 50,000 tons were mined. Operations reduced thereafter and all work had ceased in 1910. Copper was mined near North Molton where it was found in association with lead, zinc, antimony and manganese ores. These and some gold were emplaced by fluids associated with the emplacement of the Cornubian batholith of which the Dartmoor granite is the largest exposed part. Silver and lead were worked at Combe Martin during the thirteenth century and again during the Elizabethan era.

John Value Dennis (1915/1916 ‚Äì December 1, 2002) was an American ornithologist and botanist. Dennis was an undergraduate at George Washington University but his study was interrupted by World War II. During the war, he served as a radar technician with the Flying Tigers aircraft unit in China. He finished his undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin, obtaining a degree in political science. This was followed by a master's degree in botany from the University of Florida. He started (but did not complete) a PhD in ornithology at the University of Illinois. He studied woodpeckers in particular and searched extensively for the critically endangered ivory-billed woodpecker in Cuba and in old-growth forests of the southeastern United States. In 1948, working with Davis Crompton, he traveled to the Oriente Province of Cuba and located a subspecies, called the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker, after it had not been reported there for several years. He reported a sighting in the Big Thicket of southeast Texas in 1966, which he called his \\"only good look at a North American ivorybill\\"; he returned in 1968, recording what he believed to be the bird's call. Many ornithologists, including James Tanner, generally regarded as the leading authority on ivory-bills, were skeptical of both the sighting and the recorded bird. His sightings formed part of the basis for the creation of the Big Thicket National Preserve. He wrote A Complete Guide to Bird Feeding (1975), a book that increased interest in bird feeding.

Charles Franks was allotted a run at Mount Cottrell in the Port Phillip District of New South Wales as a member of the Port Phillip Association. Franks had arrived at Point Gellibrand (modern day Williamstown) on 23 June with 500 sheep and had reached the Mount Cottrell area by 2 July. With his business partner George Smith they pitched their tent close to thick bushland \\"about eight miles\\" from the nearest station. George Smith left the camp to get supplies from the port. Soon after Franks and Flinders were visited by five Aboriginal people (two men, two women and a boy). George Smith later returned to the area finding a ransacked tent and later raising the armed party. Squatters Armytage and Malcolm discovered the remains of Franks and Flinders near their hut after a period of them being missing. At the time it was believed that the Aboriginal people that had been seen around their hut were involved. Franks and Flinders were killed with tomahawk blows to the head and their dog was found speared. The party of 17 men (Henry Batman, Mr Guy, George Hollins, Michael Leonard, David Pitcairn, Alexander Thomson, William Winberry, John Wood and Aboriginals Benbow, Derrimut, Baitlange (Ben Benger) and Ballyan, Sydney Aboriginals Bullett, Stewart and Joe the marine went in search of the perpetrators, armed with muskets. They tracked a tribe of about 80 Aboriginal people to Mount Cottrell area and watched them during the evening. At dawn, the party attacked from firing on the tribe and the ensuing raid resulted in the death of many tribal Aboriginals. Some early media reports of the incident stated five Aboriginals people were killed, but according to Aboriginal oral history 35 had been killed. Contemporary research suggest ten were killed. The Cornwall Chronicle stated the party put > into effect a preconcerted plan of attack, succeeded in \\"ANNIHILATING THEM.\\"  Aftermath  Media at the time were divided as the \\"Colony has to deplore the loss of one of its brightest ornaments\\". Some championed the revenge: > The barbarous murders of Mr. Franks and his shepherd, have been, in some > degree, revenged, which, we trust, will be a warning to the natives, not in > future to commit wanton excesses upon our countrymen. While some were critical of the lawless nature of the killing. The Tasmanian Colonial Times newspaper editorializing: > This will not end here - a tribe swept off from the face of the earth so > illegally - so diabolically - will require retributive justice. Good heaven! > Is a whole community to be murdered in cold blood for the offence of three? > -- this is indeed visiting the sins of the father upon the children. Every > human being, save the Port Philip jobbers, will look with horror on such > pro-ceedings; and this very act alone ought to destroy the settlement. Newly appointed Port Phillip Magistrate William Lonsdale landed at Point Gellibrand months later (around late September 1836) to formalise the illegal settlement of Melbourne. After which he undertook an investigation into the incident. Party members were interviewed and admitted firing on the tribe but were unaware if any were wounded. The event was notable at the time as Charles Franks was the first free settler to be killed (convicts had been killed previously) in frontier violence in new European colony of Port Phillip. The reprisal raid foreshadowed similar conflict that would take place across Victoria's western district.

Designed by George Phillips Manners, it was built in 1846‚Äì47 and closed in 1983. The church, now a private residence, is a Grade II listed building. History Prior to the construction of Holy Trinity, the residents of Clandown were served by the parish church of St John at Midsomer Norton. In circa 1834, the Bishop of Bath and Wells licensed a schoolroom at Clandown to be used for services, but the increasing population led to the need for better church accommodation. Rev. Charles Otway Mayne, the vicar of Midsomer Norton, began raising funds for a purpose-built church by grants and private subscription. Plans for the church and its parsonage house were drawn up by George Phillips Manners, with Mr. John Thatcher of Weston hired as the builder. The Church Building Association granted ¬£105 in late 1845 and the Prince of Wales donated ¬£100 in early 1846. ¬£300 was also received from the Incorporated Society. The church's corner stone was laid by Mr. W. C. James on 29 June 1846. The church was completed but awaited consecration by February 1847, when an appeal was made to raise the remaining ¬£500 required. A further ¬£350 had been raised by the time the church was consecrated by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Richard Bagot, on 19 October 1847. ¬£2,200 had been spent on the church and its parsonage house. In addition to the remaining debt of ¬£150, a further ¬£500 was required for the endowment. Clandown was made its own ecclesiastical parish in 1849. Holy Trinity was declared redundant on 1 March 1983 and permission was granted in 1983-84 for its conversion into a single dwelling. The potential use of the church as a community hall was investigated in 1986, but the church was subsequently sold by the Church Commissioners to a private owner in 1987. In 1988-89, planning permission was granted to split the church into two dwellings. Retrospective permission was granted in 2014 for the building's conversion into a single residence. Architecture Holy Trinity is built of local stone with slate roofs in the Perpendicular style. It has a cruciform plan and is made up of a two-bay nave, chancel, transepts, vestry, south porch, tower and bellcote. The church was designed to accommodate 380 persons.

History UBQ Materials was founded in 2012 by Yehuda Pearl and Jack (Tato) Bigio. UBQ has raised $27 million in investments from private investors, Battery Ventures and EASME. The company's operations include offices in Tel Aviv, Israel, and a manufacturing plant in Kibbutz Tze'elim in the Negev area of southern Israel. The patented UBQ product and manufacturing process was developed between 2012 and 2017. In 2018, commercial production commenced. In March 2020, the company named Mike Thaman, former chairman and chief executive officer of Owens Corning, as its chief executive officer. Technology Waste conversion technology produces thermoplastic pellets as an alternative to oil-based resources that are traditionally used in plastics manufacturing. Waste conversion technology extracts metal, glass, minerals, cardboard and paper for further recycling. Household food waste, paper, cardboard and dirty plastics are dried and milled into a powder and reconstituted into a plastic-like composite. The resulting pellets are integrated with standard plastic pellets by conventional plastics manufacturers to create substitute plastic materials. UBQ Materials thermoplastic pellets. =Production Process= The raw materials of the process are organic materials and mixed plastics. Each stream is broken down to its core components. Residual solid municipal waste (fabrics, paper, cardboard and mixed plastics) and organic waste (food waste and paper) typically comprising about 70% of feedstock weight, is broken down to its particulate components - lignin, cellulose, fibers, and sugars - then reassembled and bound together into a matrix to create a thermoplastic composite material in pellet or powder form. During production, minimal energy and no water are used thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and residual waste by-products. For every ton of material produced, the process prevents the equivalent of 3-30 tons of CO2 from being created by keeping waste from decomposing in landfills. =Application= Bio-based thermoplastic material is used in injection, compression molding, extrusion and 3D printing, and is compatible with PP, PE, PLA, and PVC. It typically has concentrations of 30% to 100%. It may be compounded with additives to modify coloration, impact strength, and UV resistance. Partnerships = State of Virginia= In August 2019, the Virginia Waste Management Authority was the first U.S. company to purchase waste containers made of bio-based thermoplastic material. =McDonald's= In November 2019, fast-food chain McDonald's Latin America franchisee Arcos Dorados integrated climate positive product materials into its Latin America restaurants and supply chains. =Daimler AG= In January 2020, German automotive manufacturer Daimler AG began testing bio-based thermoplatsic materials for use in production of vehicle passenger cabins and outer vehicle plastic parts.

Spiritual life  Whilst Therasia of Nola embraced religious life alongside Paulinus, Amanda and Aper's partnership was different. In their case, Aper took a religious life, whilst his wife Amanda took on the 'worldly responsibilities' so he could focus on the spiritual. By supporting her husband's spiritual life practically, Amanda was also living a holy life, being ‚Äúa safe tower on a steady rock [she] would defy the tempests‚Äù (Epistula 44, Paulinus of Nola). The form this took was being the manager of both their estates, a position of power for women during this period. She also had sole responsibility for the raising of their children. Amanda also provided \\"moral edification\\" to Aper and the religious purpose their marriage had moved to, through chasteness, and providing public support. Through her practicality Amanda enabled spiritual growth for her husband so he could become a religious leader - Paulinus wrote to them both in praise stating: \\"You have passed from your bodies into Christ's\\". Amanda is held up as an example of how valuable secular support for religious life was and how women in the Late Roman world had financial agency within marriage. Marital life Amanda was a correspondent and supporter of the church, through her marriage to Aper, a Roman provincial lawyer, governor and later monk. She built a religious life with her husband and was given advice by Paulinus of Nola and Therasia of Nola on how to build a religious partnership out of their marriage. Paulinus and Therasia wrote to Amanda and Aper offering them advice on their 'spiritual marriage' and it is likely the four had been friends prior to Paulinus and Therasia wholly embracing religious life.

History This area formerly known as \\"Thung Phaya Thai\\", a vast field in the area of inner capital, it covers the area from the outskirts of Dusit Palace next to the Thung Som Poi (now is the location of Chitralada Royal Villa) to the Victory Monument and Phaya Thai Palace today. The next area was known as \\"Thung Bang Kapi\\" of Bang Kapi and Wang Thonglang with Huai Khwang Districts in present day. Although it was an inner city area, but the atmosphere in the past, it was a rural countryside and fresh air. Khlong Phaya Thai, a khlong (canal) which was approximately two km (1.24 mi) long, flows through the area. Therefore, King Rama V bought more than a thousand rai (more than 395 acres) of land here. He ordered the construction of Phaya Thai Palace in 1910 along the banks of Khlong Samsen, as well as having to build a road connecting Hua Lamphong Road (now Rama IV Road), pass Pathum Wan Road (now Rama I Road), parallel to Pra Chae Chin Road (now Phetchaburi Road), cuts across eastern railway line and Duang Tawan Road (now Si Ayutthaya Road), as far as ending at Pao Road (now Phahonyothin Road), called \\"Phaya Thai Road\\". The king and his wife, Queen Saovabha Phongsri used the palace as a royal retreat, and the king used this place to test the cultivation as well. In addition, in those days, this palace was also used as a place to hold up to the Royal Ploughing Ceremony, which was a ceremony that has existed since ancient times to give the morale to farmers in the beginning of the planting season. After King Rama V passed away in 1910, Queen Saovabha Phongsri used this place as a residence until she died in 1919. This area was also residence to Muslims as well. Currently, although the fields have disappeared, Khlong Phaya Thai was filled in to allow the road to be built, until it became just a small waterway in Phramongkutklao Hospital, but the name \\"Thung Phaya Thai\\" is still used for this area, and due to the numerous modifications of Bangkok administration making Thung Phaya Thai become part of Ratchathewi District to the present.

She emerged from her internment in successive concentration camps and prisons, followed by time in a labour camp, with her health badly damaged. Over time she was helped to recovery by a doctor who, like her, was a surviving resistance activist. She later worked as a sales representative promoting Persil washing powder. For several decades following the war she kept her Nazi-era activities to herself, but during the 1980s she began to tell her own story of those times. In 1999 the municipal authorities at St. Valentin, where she had repeatedly placed her life in danger in pursuit of her relief work during the National Socialist period, conferred \\"Ehrenb√ºrgerschaft\\" on her (loosely, made her an \\"honoured citizen\\" in recognition of her work. Biography =Provenance and early years= The twelfth of her parents' children, Anna Strasser was born at St. Valentin, a small country town a short distance to the south of Linz, and approximately equidistant between Salzburg and Vienna. Her mother was her father's second wife. There were also two half-siblings from her father's first marriage which had ended prematurely when his first wife and died of Tuberculosis. By the time of Anna's birth five of her siblings had already died young, but family life was nevertheless lively and happy. Johann Strasser, who worked as a businessman and insurance company representative, died eight months short of what would have been his seventieth birthday, early in 1938: that was also six weeks before German armies invaded post-democratic Austria. \\"At first we were very sad about his death\\", his daughter later wrote, \\"but when Hitler arrived, we knew that God had called him away at the right time\\". After her father died her mother took over the insurance company agency work while her eldest half- sister took charge of the family shop. She had learned from her parents about the workings of business and then, when she was seventeen, embarked on a twelve-month commercial apprenticeship in Linz in the support office of a (medical) doctor called Dr. Gatti. Johann Strasser (1868 ‚Äì 1938) was a deeply religious man and a town councillor: he had viewed the rise of Hitler with deep foreboding. When the German armies invaded from the west in March 1938, Anna Strasser was working in Linz, in the middle of her apprenticeship year. She would later recall that in the city she saw the enthusiasm on the faces of those who welcomed Hitler's arrival, but also the sadness on the faces of many friends and their parents. Very quickly rumours emerged of people being beaten up, sometimes leading to their deaths, because of their political or religious beliefs, or simply because they belonged to the \\"wrong\\" race. Soon afterwards, Strasser recalled, it became hard to ignore the way that politically engaged non-Nazis were being taken away to \\"death camps\\". =Mauthausen= In March 1939 she replied to a job advertisement in a newspaper. Strasser was offered and accepted at job in the book keeping department at the warehouse depot of an agricultural co-operative on the eastern edge of the little town of Mauthausen. She started her new job on 15 April 1939. The date was memorable because it was also her eighteenth birthday. Each day she commuted from her home in St. Valentin to the office at Mauthausen, which involved a train ride across to the far bank of the Danube of approximately 8 kilometers / 5 miles, followed by a short walk of around 250 meters from the passenger station where she arrived to the rail shipment depot where the agricultural co-operative had its warehouse and office. Unusually for those times, the office block in which she worked was 12 storeys high: from the higher floors the workers could enjoy an excellent view of the surrounding countryside. Even before she took the new job she had picked up reports, while working for the family business in her home town, of a camp being built by forced labourers on a hill just outside Mauthausen where prisoners would serve their sentences. There were German soldiers on the streets from whom she picked up alarming stories about similar camps already set up before 1938 in Germany, administered by National Socialist \\"SS\\" paramilitaries and the atrocities committed inside them. By the time she started her new job at Mauthausen the opening of the Mauthausen camp, constructed by prisoners shipped in from the Dachau concentration camp during the previous eight months, was no secret to anyone. She saw how the \\"unfortunate prisoners\\" were forced out of the train carriages at Mauthausen station and herded by their SS guards to the camp. After the outbreak, in September 1939, of the European war the numbers of prisoners greatly increased, arriving from many parts of Europe, sometimes in passenger carriages and sometimes in cattle trucks. Shortly after this prisoners, under SS supervision, constructed a special dedicated ramp for the concentration camp at the station, designed to receive prisoners and supplies. =Encounters with the SS= The agricultural co-operative was required to sell cabbages, potatoes, maize and turnips, supplied by the farmers, to the Mauthausen camp. The accounts were dealt with in the office in which Anna Strasser worked, which gave ample opportunities for the junior SS members sent to settle the invoices to engage in chat with the attractive office-girls. Keen to impress, one of the men told Anna and her colleague Annemarie how many camp inmates had \\"bought it\\" the previous day. One boasted, \\"Today I killed two more detainees\\" (\\"Ich habe heute wieder zwei H√§ftlinge umgelegt\\"). Strasser asked him how he had managed this. \\"I chased both the detainees into a sewage pit, placed a box over the top of it, and stood on top of it until they suffocated\\". \\"Have you no heart in your body?\\" \\"But Miss, that's not part of the SS-man's make up. We rejoice if we get rid of a couple of useless extra mouths, and we receive special rations for it\\". Another of them disclosed, \\"Last night 119 detainees froze to death. The barracks are only temporary constructions. The wind penetrates through and through. The detainees were lying on their wooden board-bunks without sheets or blankets.\\" Not all the SS-members she met were so casual about inmate deaths. One very young man came into pay the bills who seemed to have been profoundly traumatised by what he had seen: \\"Yesterday twenty Norwegian male and female students arrived, aged between 14 and 18. They were interrogated and then made to line up. I was on duty. The Squadron leader came and placed an electrical device against the temple of each of them, one by one. They fell down dead. A very young pretty girl fell to her knees and begged for her life. 'I so much want to see my parents and my homeland again. Let me live'. The SS-man kicked her. She renewed her plea to make him change his mind, but in vain. He applied the \\"phone\\" to her and she fell down dead'\\" Strasser's reaction was not unsympathetic, and hints at the support she continued to find from the Christian faith she had inherited: \\"You slid into this organisation without appreciating the weight of your responsibilities. Now you have to recognise that you have not grown to accept the cruelties of the SS. But you should not despair. Place yourself on the side of the good ones. In your position you have opportunities enough to help these unfortunate people. Only by doing that can you be justified before God and before humanity\\". The young man shook hands and sadly left. Strasser recalled later that they never saw him again, but often prayed for him. Strasser was in the habit if eating her lunch at the station restaurant where fellow diners included railway workers, workers from the nearby quarry, and SS-men. On one occasion she and her colleagues were joined at the long table by a notably good-looking SS-man. After the usual casual chatter she asked him directly how it was possible for people to be detained in prisons and camps without any legal process: \\"Where is the rule of law?\\" The man made no answer and changed the subject. But after lunch, as she took a brief walk before returning to her desk, he caught up with her. \\"Do not be angry that I followed you. I wanted to say that you need to be a little more careful with your comments on the rule of law etc. Those comments may take you to places from which there will be no return. I am wanting only what is best for you. I am an ethnic German from Poland where my parents have a large farm. German and Polish speakers used to come and go equally in our home: we all got along as friends. Then one day a German aircraft dropped a lot of leaflets proclaiming, 'Germans, wake up! The Poles are your enemies'. From that moment the mistrust took root. I was enthused by Hitler's speeches. I volunteered for the SS. Plonker! Now I'm stuck with it, and take my turn as a camp guard. You cannot begin to know how much I hate this service. And I could not live any longer if I did not try to help these wretches. Depending on the duties assigned to me, I do the following: I round up the detainees and take them to the rollcall place where I savagely shout at them. Then I herd them into a cellar where they can smoke, converse and eat. They get a chance to be human. Every so often one of the inmates hits a partition with a rubber truncheon and others scream, so that sounds emerge of horrible mistreatment. SS comrades who think the same way lock the door so that no unsympathetic visitors can come in. We carry on with this theatre again and again. Maybe one day we'll be caught. But we have nothing to lose. If we get sent to the frontline it will be our own people who will be shooting us, from behind\\". =Food= Strasser expressed her support, while insisting that if the two of them came across one another again at the station restaurant or elsewhere, it would be better that they should ignore each other. Every day, as she took her short walk after lunch beside the ramp leading from the railway to the camp, Anna Strasser took to carrying basic supplies with her, such as bread, sugar, biscuits, needles and twine with buttons. Sometimes she dropped them where inmates, who were badly underfed, might find them, and inmates soon learned to watch out for her lunchbreak walks. On one occasion she was rewarded with a letter of gratitude that the inmates had somehow managed to send using the postal service. She was not the only one who tried to find ways to get food to camp detainees. Her colleague Franz Winklehner, the store manager, got into the habit of purchasing corn, maize, turnips, cabbage and potatoes from farmers making deliveries to the depot, exchanging them for fertilizers and settling the balance. He was also sometimes seen to be throwing bread and cigarettes to newly arrived detainees being herded along the ramp from the train, past his office, to the camp. Winklehner's home was in the same building as the co- operative offices. One evening towards the end of 1940 the Winklehners received a visit at home from two Gestapo men during their evening meal. He was taken to Linz for questioning and then taken to the Dachau concentration camp. On 26 February 1941 his wife received from him a letter in which he wrote that he would probably be released a couple of months later in an amnesty to be announced in celebration of Hitler's birthday. The next news, when it came, was that he had died. Anna Strasser was able to accompany his widow to see his body. During the visit they were able to see the briefly man in his coffin but the widow was shouted at when she went to touch Winklehner's corpse. They were informed brusquely that Franz Winklehner had died of \\"circulatory disorders\\". Pausing only to utter a hurried Pater Noster, as they were hustled out Anna Strasser made herself a promise, \\"Even if I end up dying like Mr Winklehner, I will help wherever I can.\\" She did. =Tanks and drugs= With the pressures of war intensifying, in 1942 Anna Strasser was recruited to work in the vast new Nibelungenwerk (factory) at nearby Herzograd (administratively part of St. Valentin), where Tiger Tanks were being produced by a workforce that would eventually reach approximately 15,000. Strasser worked at the tank plant till her arrest in September 1944. She was assigned, in the first instance, to the accounts department where she found herself with \\"a jovial boss and lovely colleagues\\". During the summer months the glass fronted offices became unbearably hot. Both for this reason and because she once again could look out of the windows and see prisoners from Mauthausen, who had been conscripted as forced labourers to work at the plant, being beaten to death. One day she suffered a nervous and physical collapsed and wept uncontrollably for a sustained period. This led to her being placed on sick leave for many weeks. When she was seen by a specialist doctor she explained her symptoms and was accordingly assigned to work half time, working mornings and then returning home while colleagues remained at work through the afternoon. This gave her much more time than hitherto to attend to the needs of government victims. One opportunity was provided by the arrival of large numbers of Jewish families from Hungary at the Windberg camp, which was approximately 15 minutes away. Each day these people were driven past the Strasser family's shop to the sports fields behind the house where they were tasked with building bunkers. They were mostly former office workers, completely unused to the heavy physical work which was now required of them, and they frequently needed help. One of their number was a medical doctor who repeatedly visited the shop and took the opportunity to push notes to Maria Strasser, Anna's sister, begging for certain carefully specified drugs and medications. Anna Strasser made it her business to visit Dr. Kleinsasser, the local railway doctor. Kleinsasser was a party member, but also a good man. Strasser told him why she needed the drugs and the doctor wrote out the necessary prescriptions, identifying Anna Strasser as the patient. She then took the prescriptions to one of various pharmacies in any one of six towns in the area, in order to avoid triggering suspicion through her seemingly inordinate need for a fantastically diverse range of treatments. After dark she took the medications to the sports fields and left them in pre-agreed locations. Sometimes she set off the barking of dogs, but she was never caught. By 1944 the Jewish people had been taken away: no one knew where to. After the war, with Lower Austria under Soviet occupation, Dr. Kleinsasser was denounced to the Soviet authorities as a Nazi and taken away. Strasser, by this time at liberty, accompanied the doctor's son (another doctor) to visit the Soviet military commander for the region and told the man about the many prescriptions Dr Kleinsasser had written out, despite knowing that they were for Jewish prisoners. After a long silence the Soviet commander stated that the doctor and Anna Strasser would not be among the many Austrians of working age (and others) sent to Soviet labour camps\\": \\"we need people like this in the world.\\" They were free to go home. Old Doctor Kleinsasser lived on in St. Valentin for several more years. =Arrest= During 1943 and most of 1944 Anna Springer continued to seek out opportunities to help victims of government persecution. During the middle part of 1944 the Strassers received a visit from two gentlemen, allegedly from a Vienna-based resistance group, who asked about the progress of their various projects. During subsequent interrogation Anna Strasser would realise that the two gentelemen were sent my the Gestapo. She was arrested at the end of the afternoon on 11 September 1944 when she arrived home to find the local policeman waiting for her in an agitated state. She knew him well: he regularly went bowling with her brother- in-law. He told her that a Gestapo man was waiting for her in the house. After she had briefly greeted her sister and some customers in the shop she went through to then living room where a tall man in civilian dress was waiting for her. He presented himself and explained politely that he had to arrest her for anti-state activities. She was taken across the road to the police station where she was left with the local policeman in a first floor waiting room from where she was able to make one or two short telephone calls to friends and relatives. By the time she was taken out it was dark. She was escorted onto a bus that was normally used to take people to work at the Nibelungenwerk (tank factory). The bus was full of people, some of whom were strangers but many of whom she knew. Some were tied up, others not. She squeezed in beside a Polish doctor whom she knew because they both worked at the factory. She passed him the last of the biscuits she had with her along with some cigarettes, earning herself a shouted reprimand from a Gestapo man accompanying them: \\"We are not in a coffee house: what are you thinking of!\\". The bus reached St. P√∂lten at around ten o'clock that evening. The Gestapo office was full so they were taken to the district court house where they were handed over to the policeman in charge. After he had taken their personal details and their belongings, amid a certain amount of mutual apologising, the prisoners were separated and Strasser was taken to a darkened cell. A voice from the darkness told her the whereabouts of the lavatory and a straw sack on which she could sleep: she realised she was not alone in the cell. After a night without sleep daylight appeared at the high-up window and her companion was taken away. Soon after that a metal meal tray with a large chunk of bread and a can of coffee on it were pushed through the door. Later that day she was taken to a larger cell in the same court building where four woman, under supervision, were mending laundry. Someone passed her some work and she joined in. That evening they were joined by two more women who had been working off-site during the day. Strasser admitted, in response to her new colleagues' questions, that she did not know why she was there. It turned out that the other six had all been arrested for relatively trivial offences, but nevertheless each had received an eighteen-month sentence. One had purchased food on the back market, another had committed an offence involving a kilogramme of poppy seeds, one had fallen in love with a foreigner, one had instructed her nephew not to be so wild and one had given unmarked cigarettes to someone. =Gestapo treatment= Some days later she was taken for interrogation. The question covered in very great detail her life to date. She was asked aggressively why she opposed the state but asserted that she had done nothing contrary to the interests of the state. The interrogations became increasingly aggressive and repetitive. Her questioners also triggered her anger by attacking her religious beliefs from various angles. On 21 September 1944 she was taken from her cell to the police prison which had by now become a Gestapo centre. Silently her escort placed her in a cell, chaining both of her hands and one of her ankles to large iron rings fastened securely into the wall. Using her finger nails, she scratched the date into the surface plaster: 21.9.1944. Tired out by standing but prevented by her chains from sitting or lying down, she managed to settle into a squat. Her overwhelming memory of that cell would be of its stench, of her hunger and of the \\"terrible screaming\\" from somewhere close by in the building. The next day, early, she was unchained by a policeman and escorted over to the bathroom. On returning to her cell she was chained up again, but less tightly than before. There was still no food. During the day three Gestapo men turned up and embarked on a sustained angry shouting session at her, threatening to cut off her hair and confiscating hairpins, shoe laces, suspenders and bra. The next day she heard a jangling of a key in the corridor and yelled out the one word, \\"bread\\". Shortly afterwards the door opened and a policeman pushed in a hunk of bread with his toe while indicating with his hand and face that she should tell no one about what he was doing. A pattern of hunger combined with lengthy abusive shouting sessions during which her Gestapo questioners pressed her to confess to ... something began to emerge. When she was not being interrogated she interacted a lot with God. She was forced to listen as one of her interrogators dictated a telegramme to the authorities in St. Valentin mandating the arrest of four of her friends. After about a week of this there was an abrupt change. Her angry interrogator became uncannily smooth and polite. The day came when she was sat on a large sofa surrounded by several ample leather arms chairs, in an elegant office with Persian carpets on the floor and portraits of Hitler and Himmler on the wall. She was politely informed by an exceptionally handsome Gestapo man that the authorities were not really interested in the little people, such as herself but in the \\"big fish\\" of the resistance movement. She was to be returned to society. But, of course, if she did not speak out at her interrogation scheduled for the next day, then she should not expect to come out alive. She was returned to her cell where she was provided not just with bread but with a large serving of poor quality meat stew. She was no longer chained in her cell and was permitted to eat normally as she sat on the straw mattress. The next day her interrogation session comprised a long eerily well mannered session during which Anna Strasser dictated her life story which was converted carefully into a detailed thirteen page document that included her factual recollection of her treatment by the Gestapo and concluded with an assurance that if ever she got out she would resume her support for needy people because it was in her nature, where someone needs help, to provide it. The contents were largely or wholly already known to her interrogator and she was able to dictate without interruption. On 30 September 1944 she was returned to the St. P√∂lten district court house where she rejoined her co-workers, mending laundry in the \\"sewing room\\" cell. She was welcomed back to the court house cell block with enthusiasm. Her hitherto atheist comrade Sophie Krakovski admitted to having prayed for her safe return every day and claimed to have been converted to belief by Anna Strasser's return. Strasser was unimaginably thin and her body was covered with bruises. Nevertheless, when asked about her treatment she was able to reassure her friends that she had not been beaten: merely thrown down the stairs. Her admission to her supervisor that she was not a competent seamstress was followed by a wider range of jobs, delivering meals, clearing out the cellar and working in the gardens where she was able to eat the carrots. She was treated with great kindness by several of the supervisors and granted and a wider range of freedoms than before. She was permitted to wave to soldiers housed in the barracks across the road from the court house building. On some Sundays she was even allowed out in order to attend Mass. She was permitted to receive a visit from her pregnant sister Helli and, under the supervision of a Gestapo man, permitted to eat ravenously some of the apples Helli had brought in. The meeting with Helli was remarkably relaxed, but was cut short by an air-raid warning whereupon her sister and the Gestapo man ran off to the air-raid shelter where the Gestapo man attempted to find out more about her \\"activities\\" from her sister; but her sister could honestly assert that she knew nothing about any of Anna Strasser's activities that was likely to interest the man. Strasser was still, during these Autumn months, sometimes called out of the cells area by Gestapo in order to identify some suspected anti-government activist. Sometimes they were people she recognised, but as far as the Gestapo were concerned she never succeeded in recognising any. She never found out whether she was always believed over this.

He surveyed the first neighborhood in Johannesburg, Randjeslaagte. He predicted that Johannesburg would become a city rather than disappearing like other ghost towns (as most South African civil servants of the era did), and De Villiers Street there is named after him.  Early life  De Villiers was the second son of Jacob Isaac de Villiers by his first wife, Ester Elisabeth Johanna Hoffman. De Villiers grew up on Koelenhof farm and later in Stellenbosch, studying at the South African College and becoming a surveyor. In 1863, he went to Cape Colony to work as such, but shortly afterward left for the Orange Free State. In 1865, he was tasked with surveying the farms in Ladybrand, part of the so-called \\"Conquered Area\\" from the Free State-Basotho Wars. He settled in Boshof and represented the area from 1875 to 1882 in the Volksraad (Parliament) of the Free State. After the resolution of the long-running diamond fields dispute of the 1870s stemming from Sir Henry Barkly declaring the entire area British territory, the Free State appointed De Villiers to define its boundary with Griqualand West.  On the Rand  By the time gold was discovered in the Witwatersrand, De Villiers had settled in the area. Sir Joseph Robinson, 1st Baronet surveyed mining claims on Langlaagte Farm where gold would first be found, and he also inspected the 600 plots that made up the spoil tip Randjeslaagte, the seed of Johannesburg, with the help of W.H.A. Pritchard between October 19 and November 3, 1886. The streets ran north to south and east to west artificially, with no regard to terrain, and were quite broad, countering the Transvaal government's expectation of a mere mining hamlet similar to Barberton or Pilgrim's Rest. His goal was to offer as many housing plots as possible to save money, while selling the corners as valuable business offices. The massive influx of prospective miners as well as the first merchants led the city to contract with De Villiers for expansion from 600 to 986 plots. To this end, in April 1887, the two parts of Randjeslaagte were thus connected. At the time, the claims were not proving luctrative, and the Ford and Jeppe syndicate paying for the surveys was under pressure from residents to reduce mining activity. De Villier's street plan continued from southern Marshalltown, but at the end of Bree Street some streets remained unjoined in the \\"nod,\\" but the plan was never to connect Randjeslaagte together. His plots continued west to Ferreirasdorp, but to the east the owners of plots in Randjeslaagte began auctioning off land on June 8, 1887 that would become the city's first upscale suburb, Doornfontein.  Last years  In 1895, De Villiers sold his property in Johannesburg to move to Cape Town and devote himself full-time to his hobby of astronomy. In August 1896, he joined an expedition to the island of Vadso in Norway to view an eclipse, using his surveying skills to set up their equipment. Two years later, he was one of 16 killed in a train crash in Mostert's Hoek coming back home from Vryburg, where he had been campaigning for the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope as a candidate for the Afrikaner Bond. At the time of his death, he was working on building an elaborate observatory at his house, Ambleside, in Sea Point.  Personal life  De Villiers and his wife Christina Maria Elizabeth de Vos had three sons.  Sources  * (en) Potgieter, D.J. (chief ed.) 1972. Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa.

Landscape and climate  Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary (KSWS) lies between above sea level, and is situated in the southeast corner of Cambodia along the border with Vietnam. The northwest section of KSWS forms part of Cambodia's Eastern Plains, while the montane southeast section constitutes the south-western edge of the Annamite Range range along the Sen Monorom plateau.Evans, T.

Bogor, Indonesia: CIFOR (pp. 157‚Äì86). EarthScan from Routledge. Major habitat types found within the protected area include tropical evergreen, mixed deciduous, semi-evergreen and deciduous Dipterocarp forest.Walston, J., Davidson, P., & Soriyun, M. (2001). A Wildlife Survey of Southern Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia, 95. As in much of Cambodia, two main seasons predominate in KSWS: tropical wet and dry. During the wet season, which runs between April to October, the area receives an average of of rainfall. Temperatures range annually from . KSWS holds the world's largest population of the black-shanked douc langur, Pygathrix nigripes, estimated at around 23,000 individuals.  Biodiversity  Mixed forest types and a range of elevation gives rise to a rich collection of biodiversity, both flora and fauna. A total of 959 plant, fungi, and animal species have been recorded in the area, the highest reported number for any Cambodian protected area. A total of 356 bird species have been recorded, exceeding the highest number recorded on eBird for any site in CambodiaSullivan, B.L., C.L. Wood, M.J. Iliff, R.E. Bonney, D. Fink, and S.

Significant threatened ungulate populations are present, including Eld's deer, sambar deer, banteng, and the largest living wild bovid, the gaur. In 2016, the tiger was acknowledged as having been driven to extinction in Cambodia, and in KSWS the last record of tiger was from 2006. yellow-cheeked crested gibbon, Nomascus gabriellae, live in KSWS, one of the largest populations of this endangered species. At least 15 newly discovered species have been described from KSWS (the type locality); two mammals, two amphibians, two reptiles, and nine insects: * Titania's woolly bat (Kerivoula titania) * Indochinese thick- thumbed bat (Glischropus bucephalus) * O'Reang horned frog (·ûÄ·ûÑ·üí·ûÄ·üÇ·ûî·ûü·üí·ûì·üÇ·ûÑ·û¢·ûº·ûö·ûö·û∂·üÜ·ûÑ, Ophryophryne synoria) * Mouhot's litter frog (·ûÄ·ûÑ·üí·ûÄ·üÇ·ûî·ûü·üí·ûõ·ûπ·ûÄ·ûò·ûΩ·û†·ûΩ·ûè, Leptobrachium mouhoti) * Red-eyed green pit-viper (Trimeresurus rubeus) *Scincella nigrofasciata, a skink species *Cyana angkorensis, a moth species *Naarda furcatella, a moth species *Dichomeris hainanensis, a moth species *Dichomeris magnimacularis, a moth species *Thubana seimaensis, a moth species *Promalactis apicuncata, a moth species *Promalactis quadrilobata, a moth species *Promalactis seimana, a moth species *Tanna kimtaewooi, a cicada species A total of 75 threatened species (classified as Critically endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List) have been recorded as present at the site, as well as 106 CITES listed species, and 46 species listed as Endangered or Rare under Cambodian law. A total of 28 EDGE species are found within KSWS, seven species of which are in the global top 100 for their taxonomic group. = National, regional, and global importance = In addition to having the highest number of species recorded in any Cambodian protected area, KSWS has been highlighted as an area of biodiversity importance under a range of prioritization frameworks.  Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance  The Keo Seima REDD+ project qualifies under the Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) Standards Gold Level for biodiversity under both vulnerability and irreplaceability criteria.  Biodiversity hotspot  Under the framework developed by Conservation International, KSWS forms part of the Indo-Burma Biodiversity hotspot.  Endemic Bird Area (EBA), Important Bird Area (IBA)  The protected area forms part of the EBA 144, South Vietnam Lowlands Endemic Bird Area, recognized for its breeding populations of three restricted-range bird species that characterize the EBA: Germain's peacock-pheasant, Orange-necked partridge and Grey-faced tit-babbler. KSWS is also covered parts of two Important Bird Areas: KH026 (the Mondulkiri - Kratie Lowlands) and KH027 (Snoul / Keo Sema / O Reang). These are prioritized for conservation of Orange-necked partridge, Siamese fireback, Green peafowl, White-winged duck, and Great hornbill, and for vultures, ibises, sarus crane and green peafowl.  Global 200  Under the Global 200 priority ecoregions for global conservation, KSWS is included in two areas: * Indochina Dry Forests, ecoregion 54. Critical or Endangered. * Annamite Range Moist Forests, ecoregion 25. Vulnerable.  Last of the Wild  KSWS is included as one of the 569 Last of the Wild areas globally that in 1992 - 1995 were found to have been least affected by human activities, and again included in the v2 2004 update. These areas are: * Southeastern Indochina dry evergreen forests * Central Indochina dry forests  High Conservation Value Forest  During development of the REDD+ project a number of high conservation values were identified: * HCV1: Forest areas containing globally, regionally or nationally significant concentrations of biodiversity values ** HCV 1.1: Protected Areas ** HCV 1.2: Threatened and Endangered Species ** HCV 1.3: Endemic Species * HCV2: Forest areas containing globally, regionally or nationally significant large landscape level forests * HCV3: Forest areas that are in or contain rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems Traditional Bunong house  Communities  Unusually for a protected area in Cambodia, KSWS is home to a large human population, predominately of the Bunong ethnic group. A traditionally Animist group, forests play a large role in community identity. In March 2012, Andoung Kraloeng village in KSWS became the first Indigenous community in Mondulkiri Province, and third nationally, to receive a collective land title under the 2001 Land Law. Since then, a total of 11 indigenous communities have been awarded legal rights to their traditional land within KSWS, facilitated by the Wildlife Conservation Society and the KSWS project. These titles have already proved vital for communities, allowing them to resist illegal land grabs, with one precedent-setting case reaching the high courts. Approaching a Bunong village in Mondulkiri Province. Rural livelihoods in the area are typically based on agriculture and forest use, including rain-fed rice paddy, cassava, cashew, rubber and resin tapping from Dipterocarpus species, Dipterocarpus alatus and Dipterocarpus intricatus. Mondulkiri Province has one of the highest population growth rates in Cambodia.NIIS (2019) General Population Census of the Kingdom of Cambodia 2019.

In 2016, all protected areas under management of the Forestry Administration, including what was then Seima Protection Forest, were transferred to management by the Ministry of Environment and the sub-national Departments of Environment for Mondulkiri and Krati√© provinces.Sub-decree No. 69 on the Transfer of the Protected Forest, Forest Conservation and Production Forest Areas, and Economic Land Concessions between MAFF, and MoE. https://data.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/en/dataset/-sub-decree-no-69-on-the- transfer-of-the-protected-forest-forest-conservation-and-production-forest The area has been supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society since its inception providing technical and financial support across the site. A number of other NGOs support projects and communities throughout KSWS, including World Hope International supporting Jahoo Gibbon Camp in Andoung Kraloeng village, and the Elephant Livelihoods Initiative Environment (E.L.I.E.) supporting the Elephant Valley Project (EVP) in Pu Trom village. = REDD+ project = The majority of KSWS is included in a REDD+ project that is the largest carbon emission reduction program in Cambodia's land use sector. Over the 10-year period from 2010 the project is predicted to avoid 17.4 million tons of CO2-e emissions,Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary Project Description v7.1 2015. y Wildlife Conservation Society for the Ministry of Environment of the Royal Government of Cambodia https://verra.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/01/CCB_PROJ_DESC_ENG_C0047_11NOV2016.pdf equivalent to 4 million passenger vehicles or 4 coal-fired power stations. Local communities from 20 villages in and around the protected area have signed agreements to join the KSWS REDD+ project and receive a proportion of profits from the sale of carbon credits.  Threats  Illegal deforestation in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia Large-scale development projects are under active development, with more planned in the landscape, including mining concessions, active economic land concessions for rubber, new roads, and power transmission lines. KSWS shares its eastern border with Vietnam, and cross-border trade contributes to illegal logging of high value timber species. Migration from other provinces and local demand for expanding farming land continues to drive conversion of forest to agriculture in areas in close proximity to roads, existing agriculture, and markets. Poaching with snares threatens many terrestrial species, with a young Asian elephant calf killed in 2016. Elephants are also threatened by agricultural encroachment, with one baby elephant killed in 2018 when becoming trapped in a hole left by the use of fire to illegally clear forest for agriculture, and 11 elephants becoming trapped in an irrigation pool in 2017; in this case, all 11 elephants were successfully rescued by local authorities, NGOs including the Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wide Fund for Nature, the Elephant Valley Project, and local communities.

M√ºller is a German business group based in Brake, Unterweser. The company was founded in 1821 and is family owned. J. M√ºller owns and operates seaport terminals on the River Weser and offers port and logistics infrastructure. Other fields of activity include the construction of wind turbines and the trade in steel and animal proteins (fishmeal). The company employs about 460 people at various locations. History In 1821 Johann M√ºller founded a Freight forwarder business on the Lower Weser. In the following years he specialized in the direct handling of goods and transport. In 1862, the railway line between Bremerhaven and Geestem√ºnde was built, which led to losses in maritime trade and thus also in J. M√ºller. During the time of National Socialism, the business of the company continued. In 1937, Hans M√ºller founded an inland shipping company and expanded crane operations in Brake. 1953 M√ºller bought the Bremer-Besigheimer √ñlfabriken at Bremer Holzhafen (one of Bremen harbours). Today this place is the headquarter of J. M√ºller Weser GmbH. The company Bremer-Besigheimer √ñlfabriken was founded in Besigheim in 1895 and opened a branch in Bremer Holzhafen. From 1920, only the branch was operated on the Weser. Seaport Brake The seaport Brake (seehafen Brake) is today dominated by the facilities and extensive areas by J. M√ºller. The company also sells space for port-related industrial settlements at the Brake Logistics Center (BLC), in the Niedersachsen Port (Boitwarder Groden) and development areas in the Niedersachsenkai area.
