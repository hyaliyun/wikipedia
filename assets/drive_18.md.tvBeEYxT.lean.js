It follows two linguists, Greg Anderson of the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages and David Harrison of Swarthmore College, as they travel around the world to collect recordings of some of the last speakers of several moribund (dying) languages: Chulym in Siberia; Chemehuevi in Arizona, U.S.; Sora in Odisha, India; and Kallawaya in Bolivia. Production Seth Kramer, one of the directors, describes how he first got the idea for The Linguists when, in Vilnius, Lithuania, he could not read Yiddish inscriptions on a path in spite of his Jewish heritage. He joined with Daniel A. Miller in 2003 to form Ironbound Films, and received a $520,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to support the film. Later in 2003, the directors chose Anderson and Harrison to be the protagonists of the film. In 2004, director Jeremy Newberger joined the project. It took three years to film The Linguists, and during this time over 200 hours of film were collected. During this time, the cast and crew travelled to numerous remote areas that one reporter describes as \\"godforsaken,\\" and coped with physical ailments such as altitude sickness. The film was completed in August 2007. Content The film begins with the fact that a large proportion of the world's languages (half, out of a total of 7,000, according to the film) are going extinct. The film's two protagonists, Anderson and Harrison, set out both to gather recordings of several endangered languages in order to document these languages later, and to educate viewers about the current rate of language extinction. In the process, they travel to the Andes mountains in South America, to villages in Siberia, to English boarding schools in Odisha, India, and to an American Indian reservation in Arizona. The film addresses issues including the spread of major global languages and how they contribute to language extinction; political and social reasons that some languages have been repressed; and reasons that language revitalization and language documentation are important (including both maintaining a scientific record of that language, and preserving unique local knowledge and history that is only carried in the local language). Reception The film was screened at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, and later had success on the \\"indie film circuit.\\" It also received attention among the linguistics community on websites such as Language Log. The film has been lauded as \\"the talk of the town at Sundance;\\" \\"a fascinating journey;\\" \\"funny, enlightening and ultimately uplifting;\\" \\"a hoot;\\" and ‚Äúshaggy and bittersweet.‚Äù While it received some minor criticism for choppy, confusing editing, the subject matter has been called \\"fascinating\\" and \\"compelling,\\" and the spirit of the film's protagonists has been compared to Indiana Jones.

D√ºsseldorf: Droste, 1997. p. 274 =War and Post-war= In 1913 Gl√ºcksmann began post-graduate studies in Law. Gl√ºcksmann's university studies were however interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. Gl√ºcksmann became an officer, commanding over a company of carabiners. Gl√ºcksmann was wounded in the war, and settled down in Bielsko (Bielitz). In Bielsko, he opened an attorney's office of his own. In Bielsko he became associated with the German intellectuals of the town. He was elected to the town council. In 1920 he was active in the Social Democratic electoral bloc 'Forward'. He was a leading figure of the Austrian Social Democratic Party in Bielsko, and worked with its press organ Volksstimme. In 1922, he managed to merge the Bielitz branch of the Austrian Social Democratic Party with the German Social Democratic party organizations in Upper Silesia, forming the German Social Democratic Party (DSDP). The DSDP sought to organize German socialists throughout the Polish republic. The DSDP later evolved, after a series of mergers, into the German Socialist Labour Party in Poland (DSAP). =Role as party ideologue= After J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's (a former socialist who would become a Marshal of Poland) coming to power (during the May Coup in 1926), Gl√ºcksmann argued for opposition against the new regime and claimed that Pi≈Çsudski had abandoned socialism. The first joint protests by DSAP and the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) were organized on Gl√ºcksmann's initiative. In the 1930s he argued in favour of cooperation with the Communist Party of Poland and in 1934 he urged the DSAP to struggle jointly with the communists against fascism.Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918-1939\\\\. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49. D√ºsseldorf: Droste, 1997. p. 277 =Rise of fascism= Gl√ºcksmann welcomed the Popular Front line adopted by the 7th congress of the Communist International in 1935. In Bielsko, local National Socialists began a campaign of harassment against Gl√ºcksmann. As a result, Gl√ºcksmann resigned from his position as the chairman of the DSAP organization in the Bielsko subdistrict. The attacks against the party did however not decline.Blachetta- Madajczyk, Petra. Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918-1939\\\\. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49. D√ºsseldorf: Droste, 1997. p. 278 =Exile and death= In September 1939, Gl√ºcksmann and his family fled to Volhynia and from there to Lw√≥w (Lemberg or Lviv). In Lw√≥w he began working as an Arithmetics teacher. In the fall of 1940, once the area was taken over by the Soviets following the Soviet invasion of Poland, he was deported to Yoshkar-Ola, where he worked as a woodcutter. After the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement between the Polish government in exile and the Soviets, Gl√ºcksmann was free to leave Yoshkar-Ola and in the fall of 1941 he moved to Bukhara. He died in typhoid at a Bukhara hospital on October 6, 1942. His wife and children later returned to Poland, and would eventually migrate to Sweden.

Within the series, she is a human Systems Alliance Marine, who is a potential romance option for a male Shepard throughout the first three Mass Effect games. Ashley becomes part of Shepard's squad during the first observed Reaper attack in the first Mass Effect. In a late-game choice on the planet Virmire, the player must choose whether to save Ashley or Kaidan Alenko in order to advance the narrative; this choice leads to the other character's death. If Ashley is saved, she will return in a cameo appearance in Mass Effect 2 and as a member of Shepard's squad for Mass Effect 3, where she has attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander and is later bestowed Spectre status by the Citadel Council. Ashley is voiced by Kimberly Brooks. While Ashley has been consistently featured in the original trilogy's marketing and is considered one of the franchise's most prominent characters, her characterization has received a mostly negative reception; much of the criticism focused on the character's abrasive personality, intolerant views towards other alien species, and presentation as being strongly religious. Character overview Ashley is a soldier skilled with weapons and standard combat hardsuits. Prior to the events of the Mass Effect series, she is considered by Alliance leadership to be a \\"reliable and dedicated noncommissioned officer, but her service in rear-area garrisons has prevented her from gaining actual combat experience\\". Her great-grandmother, grandfather, and father all served in the Systems Alliance Navy. However, her grandfather General Williams was the only human officer to ever surrender to an alien force, specifically the turian fleet at the colony of Shanxi during the First Contact War, where humanity's first contact with extraterrestrials broke out in violence. Even though her family has been disgraced due to her grandfather's service history, she enlisted with the Systems Alliance as she felt she had something to prove. BioWare's profile for the character on the defunct official website for Mass Effect 2 described her as \\"confident, independent, and at times, outright aggressive\\". She is also \\"stubbornly insular and not willing to accept help when it is needed\\". Ashley's xenophobia is noted as one of her major flaws; she is known for her \\"aggressive instincts and tendency to speak bluntly\\" which is a liability when dealing with civilians, and occasionally expresses political opinions the Systems Alliance consider \\"problematic\\". While primarily presented as a tough and strong-willed woman who is an equal match to a male protagonist, her sensitive side is expressed through her interest in the poetry work of Alfred Tennyson. Ashley is also depicted in the series as a family-oriented and religious character, though her precise faith and beliefs are never elaborated upon except for her belief in a greater power and a concept of a final and infinite judgment by God. Joshua and Ita Irizarry, co-authors of a research paper titled \\"The Lord is My Shepard - Confronting Religion in the Mass Effect Trilogy\\" published as part of the Religion in Digital Games anthology publication, noted that Shepard may engage in explicitly religious discussions with Ashley as she is one of the more openly religious characters in the series. They observed that the character has strong religious beliefs, though she is more reticent in sharing them with other crew members as she is concerned about how they would react. Creation and conception Kimberly Brooks voiced Ashley Williams in all media. Ashley was one of the earliest companion characters to be featured in demo footage for the first Mass Effect game; in a 2006 video demo, director Casey Hudson drew attention to her fully voiced interactions with Shepard and another squad member, Garrus Vakarian, which is meant to evoke a seamless cinematic experience as opposed to the player reading an extensive amount of dialogue text. She ties her hair into a bun, and wears a bubblegum pink and marshmallow white battle armor as her default appearance in the first two Mass Effect games. For her appearance in Mass Effect 3, Ashley is intentionally redesigned with sex appeal and lets her hair down instead of tying it up. She wears a stylish officer's uniform which showcases the new Alliance colors of blue and white when not on the field.The Art of the Mass Effect Universe, p. 133. An unused idea from the third game's early development process involved Ashley confronting a corrupted Shepard, who had been forced to turn to Reaper technology to accomplish his goals, which echoed Saren's character arc from the first game. Ashley was originally voiced by E. G. Daily, but she was recast when the developers did not feel the romantic chemistry they were aiming for between the character and Shepard.The Final Hours of Mass Effect 3. Kimberly Brooks credited voice director Ginny McSwain, whom she had worked with prior to Mass Effect, for helping her \\"tap into the character\\" as a woman soldier who is deeply religious and whose family has a strong military service tradition. Brooks recalled that there were well over ten recording sessions and would generally last about four hours, where she often recorded by herself. She said working on a BioWare video game is intense as there is a lot of depth to the story and its characters, and that it is vocally stressful and more labor intensive then other media due to the size of the project and its numerous possibilities. Brooks herself does not play video games, citing a lack of free time, though she enjoyed playing Ashley. Her positive experience as Ashley's voice actor got her interested in doing further voice over work for video games. AppearancesIn video games= Ashley is the sole survivor of her squad following a surprise attack by the Geth on the human colony world Eden Prime, and joins Shepard's squad during the SSV Normandy's first mission, replacing Corporal Richard L. Jenkins who was killed in action earlier. Later in the game, on the planet Virmire, Ashley along with Kaidan will opt to assist a salarian commando unit in their assault on Saren's lab complex. During the assault, the player is confronted with a choice that may result in Ashley being killed when a nuclear warhead is detonated. If she is sacrificed, later dialogue indicates that the salarian and turian governments have awarded her their most highest medals, honoring her sacrifice for soldiers not even of her own race. Williams appears in Mass Effect 2, provided she lived through the first game. Now an Operations Chief, Williams was sent to Horizon officially on a mission to provide anti-orbital weapons to the colonists. She is first seen defending the colony against a swarm of Collector insect-like \\"seekers,\\" but ultimately is overwhelmed and paralyzed. Upon being rescued, she voices disapproval towards Shepard's alliance with the anthropocentric paramilitary group Cerberus. If a romantic relationship between her and Shepard is carried into the game, she will later send him an apologetic email, expressing her desire to be with him once more. Ashley Williams returns in Mass Effect 3, provided she survives the events of the original game. By the events of Mass Effect 3, Williams is commissioned as a Lieutenant Commander. She is seriously injured during a mission to recover plans for the Crucible on Mars, but makes a full recovery and is chosen as the second human Spectre after Shepard. Shepard eventually learns from the salarian councilor that humanity's councilor, Donnel Udina, may pose a security risk. The Normandy travels to the Citadel, where Shepard confirms with the salarian councilor that Udina has partnered with Cerberus and leads a coup to overthrow his fellow councilors, who are being protected by Ashley. Udina is killed and Cerberus forces led by the Illusive Man's trusted assassin Kai Leng retreat in response, though the salarian councilor as well as Ashley may perish by the conclusion of the event; the outcome is based on the sum total of the player's prior decisions. If Ashley survives the coup attempt, she may be allowed to join Shepard's team onboard the Normandy SR-2, and either start or resume a romantic relationship with Shepard. In the alternative, Ashley is listed on the Normandy SR-2's memorial wall on the Crew Deck. If Ashley accompanies Shepard on the final mission to the Conduit in London and the player has not accrued enough war asset points, she will die. If Ashley survives and is in a relationship with Shepard, she will place a plaque on the memorial wall on the Normandy. If enough war points are accrued, Shepard will survive and Ashley will not place the plaque, but instead will smile in reminiscence. =In other media= Ashley appears in the third issue of the comic series Mass Effect: Foundation. She is interviewed by Cerberus spy Rasa, who poses as an Alliance psychologist to trick her into recounting the attack on Eden Prime from her perspective. Analysis The character is held to be a notable example of the consequences that come with branching narratives in video games. In his article which was published by Gamasutra, Brandon Perdue noted that since players interact with the game through gameplay, the significance of choosing which character to save feels non- trivial and arises from its very real gameplay consequences. Along with Kaidan Alenko, Ashley's role in the narrative of the original trilogy was termed \\"The Virmire Survivor\\" and analyzed in the 2017 book 100 Greatest Video Game Characters; whoever is saved serves as a constant reminder of player choices throughout the trilogy. Reception Ashley has received a generally negative reception from fans and video game journalists. PC Gamer included her in their list of most annoying characters, and ridiculed her pink and white armor, though her default cobalt blue armor in Mass Effect 3 is considered to be an improvement. Gamesradar criticized her abrasive personality and said she has similar traits as Ana Lucia Cortez from the ABC television series Lost. Daniel Horowitz from VentureBeat consider Ashley to be \\"harsh and brash\\", and that her attitude is \\"out of line\\" compared to the mild mannered Kaidan. Alex Knapp, a staff writer at Forbes, criticized Ashley's revamped design in Mass Effect 3, claiming that she looks like a stripper. While Ashley is statistically more likely to be chosen compared to Kaidan for the decision at Virmire, some sources opined that this is because Kaidan is perceived to be the less palatable option; she is considered one of the least popular characters in the entire trilogy. Both Destin Legarie from IGN and Andy Kelly from PC Gamer expressed a personal preference for Kaidan over Ashley when choosing the Virmire Survivor in the first game. Horowitz argued that logically Kaidan should be prioritized over Ashley as the Virmire Survivor since she is \\"merely a straggler picked up on Eden Prime\\" while Shepard‚Äôs history with him \\"extends far beyond the opening events of the story\\". The character has been criticized for being \\"racist\\", and her emphasis on her faith has not been well received. Perdue called Ashley \\"toxically racist\\" considering she works with several non-human characters, and questioned the emotional weight behind what was \\"popularly discussed as one of the most momentous decisions a player can make in a game\\". Knapp opined that her characterization in Mass Effect 3 was awful, alleging that she is \\"more racist and more of a jerk\\" and that \\"everything that had the potential to redeem her character was stripped away\\". Joshua and Ita Irizarry noted the \\"broad negativity\\" many players have shown towards Ashley's expressions of her faith in the original Mass Effect during the course of their research, with only a minority of players indicating that Ashley's flawed personality made their gameplay experience more interesting. They surmised that based on Ashley's assertion that her faith plays a major role in who she is, her \\"religiosity may have been seen as a reflection of the player, individually, and humanity as a whole\\". Matt Cronn from Geeks Under Grace, an American pop culture website which publishes news, culture, reviews, and videos from a Christian perspective, felt that the original Mass Effect fumbled on the subject of God and religion. He opined that Ashley \\"did not go on to represent God in the best fashion\\", and called her a \\"hot-headed, judgmental\\" character who is xenophobic. Chris Thursten, a PC Gamer staff member, dissented from consensus; he said Ashley is one of his favourite BioWare characters, noting her staunch opposition to Cerberus and her willingness to question the infallibility of Shepard's decisions. He argued that Ashley is more than a sidekick and a character who could easily headline as the lead heroine, claiming that she is \\"one of the most substantially well-rounded characters in the series\\" as well as \\"one of the few that doesn't need Shepard to step in and fix her life\\". In an article published by Gamesradar which focused specifically on Ashley, Thursten acknowledged that while she is probably the most contentious among the original trilogy's cast of characters, he maintained that \\"her value to the series comes specifically from the fact that she's willing to voice challenging views\\", and that \\"companion characters are at their best when they're written like real people.\\" Brooks released a fully voiced recording of Ashley's email to Shepard on the internet sometime after the release of Mass Effect 2 and prior to the launch of Mass Effect 3. She noted that it was very well received as fans had wanted a more substantial appearance by Ashley for the second game. Brooks is aware of her character being called a \\"space racist\\", and observed that \\"everyone either loved or hated Ash\\". She noted that the best thing about voice acting for a video game are its fans, drawing attention to the passion and support she has experienced from Mass Effect fandom. Promotion and merchandise Ashley was featured prominently in marketing material such as commercials and trailers, as well as cover art for the first game. She is seen accompanying both gendered versions of Commander Shepard to battle in the cinematic trailers which promoted the March 2012 launch for Mass Effect 3. An action figure for the character was released by Play Arts Kai in 2012.

It was released on DVD in America on May 12, 2009 together with Dadnapped. It is the first Disney Channel Original Movie to air in the UK first. It first aired in America on April 24, 2009. Filming locations include Midvale and Payson Utah. Plot Pete Ivey (Jason Dolley) is a teenager who is a total introvert. His best friend, Cleatus Poole (Mitchel Musso), is the Brewster High mascot. Pete runs into some frustration when he finds that Cammie Poole, his crush, has already been asked out by Dill, the captain of the basketball team. Rejected, Pete goes home. His father tells him that to get Cammie's attention, he has to give her something to notice. On their way to the Brewster High basketball game, Cleatus comes over to ask Pete for a favor. He has a problem being the mascot: an allergy to the suit, which causes him to sneeze violently every time he puts it on. He pleads for Pete to wear the chicken suit instead. As part of the bargain, Cleatus tells Pete he will get his sister on a date with him, and he agrees. After a rocky start, Pete realizes that he is attracting Cammie's attention and acts more adventurously inside the suit. The next day, Cleatus is congratulated on \\"his\\" performance as mascot. Afterwards, Cleatus comes to see Pete and asks him what he did. Because Pete cannot describe it, Cleatus decides Pete can still be the chicken while he hides in the stands. Upon seeing Pete's natural talent for being mascot, Pete agrees to be \\"The Chicken\\" full-time. During one of the biology lessons, Pete meets cheerleader Angela Morrisey (Josie Loren) and starts crushing on her. They are both chosen for the parade float committee. The two work on together the float and become friends in the process. On the day of the parade, the town shows up for the festival and \\"The Chicken\\" is a big hit. During a dance number, Cleatus (in disguise as Pecos Bill) is accidentally discovered. Pete, escaping the crowd, he steals the sheriff's car to get away. Shortly after, Angela sees him walking and offers him a ride. When the two talk, Pete considers coming clean when Angela expresses relief that \\"The Chicken\\" is not Cleatus after all because of her developing romantic feelings for whomever is inside. However, when she confesses that she is not sure about how finding out who is inside the suit will affect these feelings, Pete decides to keep the mystery alive by retiring. Based on the adoration that the town shares for \\"The Chicken\\" and due to the financial incentives of having people attending the games, the sheriff decides to drop the charges to get the chicken to return, and the principal and basketball coach call an assembly to let \\"The Chicken\\" know that there will be no reprisals or formal charges. The town is disappointed when \\"The Chicken\\" does not appear for the next game, but a local journalist gives him the chance to explain himself on television. When he does, he mentions that the magic might be gone, comparing his unmasking to that of the Lone Ranger once the mystery is gone, it does not come back. At this moment, Angela realizes that Pete is \\"The Chicken\\", but chooses to do nothing. Pete does return during the final game to rally both the players and the crowd. With \\"The Chicken\\" resent, the team starts fighting back and closing the gap. During a time out, the audience cheers for the chicken to remove the mascot head, and Pete decides to do so. The team finishes with a last second score to win the game, and when the cheerleaders tumble in their celebration, Angela falls on Pete. They then kiss but are interrupted by Cleatus, who tells him to put his chicken head back on and join the Brewster Roosters to celebrate their only win of the year.

After the death of the first Count (knez) of Krk Dujam I Krƒçki, his sons continue to dominate over the island and the town of Krk. They left first architectural traces in the town of Krk. The oldest part of fortification is the square tower with the diocese, in which Frankopans courtroom was located.

It was restored around 1480, and again around 1600. On the tower there is bricked inscription Aureae Venetorum libertati with lions of St. Mark, which dates from 1500. This cylindrical tower has two floors and attic. On the ground floor once there were two doors, one open to the Kamplin, and the other toward the interior of the castle.

She was instrumental in establishing, developing and promoting forms of youth theatre and television in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America.Esslin, M. The Encyclopedia of World Theater (Published by Scribner, 1977) p.62 Life and work Marjorie Sigley was born on 22 December 1928, known to everyone as \\"Sigi\\", she took passionate pleasure in the arts and would travel huge, impractical distances to see a play, a ballet or an opera. But she also believed in art as an educational force, and her greatest achievement lay in pioneering many of the attitudes towards children's drama that we now take for granted. Sigley not only introduced thousands of children to what she called \\"the wonder of theatre\\", she also involved them directly in the making of it.Guardian, 10 September 1997 Sigley came from \\"a solid, very traditional\\" working-class family in Buxton, Derbyshire, where her father worked for ICI and her mother was a professional cook. From the age of 10, she became an avid consumer of movies and plays, going to everything that was staged at the Buxton repertory theatre. As a student she attended Goldsmith's College, London, studying theatre, music and dance. She was awarded a fellowship at Manchester University's drama department and it was there that she began to develop her (then novel) concept of children's drama. She became involved in theatre workshops and participation theatre, taking groups of her students to the Brighton Festival with their work. She was later to direct the Malcolm Williamson opera Julius Caesar Jones as part of the festival's opera workshops.The Times, 12 September 1997 She returned to London to a teaching career, which she combined with her drama activities. At Markfield and Woodlands ParkWoodlands Park School is in the Harringay area of North London Schools in North London, she began by adapting stage classics for performance by young children who mostly come from underprivileged backgrounds. The children were also encouraged to write, cast, design, produce and star in their own productions. In 1960, Marjorie founded the City Literary Drama Company. This presented its own work, ranging from original pantomimes to experimental mime and movement workshops at the City Lit Theatre, with people such as Ronald Smith Wilson, Claud Newman, and Dorothea Alexander. In 1968 the company visited Warsaw, Leningrad and Moscow with its children's drama programmes. In the meantime she worked as a director and writer at the Mermaid Theatre, notably directing a stage version of Erich K√§stner's Emil and the Detectives. She was invited for two spells, 1962 and 1968‚Äì69, at the Habimah National Theatre of Israel and in 1964 did a Youth Theatre tour of Czechoslovakia.Shakow, Z. The Theatre in Israel (Herzl Press, 1963) She had also taken the step into television in 1964 when she was invited to demonstrate what children's drama could achieve in a late-night ABC programme. Her contribution, which graphically demonstrated how the potentially destructive energies of teenage boys in a London suburb could be channelled creatively, made a profound impression. She was busy in television thereafter, one of her most striking contributions being Wonderworld, two 13-part series in which children in the 5‚Äì6 and 15‚Äì16 age groups, dramatised and acted stories from the Bible. In 1965 Marjorie Sigley introduced the Five O'Clock Funfair (Rediffusion, 1965) a spin-off series which regularly featured amongst others, music icons Lulu and Alexis Korner. Like all her programmes, these were outstanding for their intimate engagement with the lives and opinions of children. In 1966, she formed the Young People's Theatre Project to train primary school teachers on how to bring her methods into the classroom. And in 1969 she also ran workshops for the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Roundhouse and the Brighton Festival, which were significant forerunners of the educational programmes run by arts institutions today. In the autumn of the same year she delivered a talk on Children's Drama to the Youth Libraries Group.YLG News (Library Association: Youth Libraries Group, London, 1969) =America= In 1968, the American actress Uta Hagen watched one of Sigley's workshops at the Roundhouse and was so impressed by its revolutionary methods she invited her to New York. There Marjorie directed plays at the renowned Herbert Berghof (H.B.) Studios, Bank Street, New York, and also founded the Young People's Theater at City Center, which she directed from 1969 to 1975 where, with a group of actors, she wrote and staged 45 plays for children, as well as directing workshops involving them in the creation and performance of their own shows. Correspondence between Uta Hagen and Marjorie Sigley is held by The New York Public Library. In 1970 the Prime Minister Edward Heath gave a speech supporting and praising Marjorie's youth theatre work.Private Eye 1970 no.210-235 Also around this time (1971‚Äì1974) she became friends with Lucy Kroll, the founder and grande dame of Kroll Agency. Correspondence between Sigley and Kroll is held in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.. She remained in the United States for several years more, founding and running her own company, Sigley's Young People's Theatre in New York in 1976, before moving to Los Angeles the following year to write a screenplay. In 1977 she was awarded the Jennie Heiden Award for her work with children's theatre, by the American Alliance for Theatre and Education (AATE). Sigley's phenomenally buoyant energy found outlets in many other projects. She wrote several plays, such as Take A Fable ‚Äì a children's musical about an Animal Bill of Rights. It was first performed at the Edinburgh Festival, England, then produced successfully in New York as well as other Eastern states. In 1976 Take a Fable was performed by the Children's Touring Theatre Company of Stage West whose performance gained an entry in The Best Play's of 1976‚Äì1977.Guernsey, O.L. (eds) The Best Play's of 1976‚Äì1977 (Dodd, Mead, 1977) She also directed an opera for the Brighton Festival. In 1978 she wrote the award-winning ABC special One of a Kind, and in 1980 wrote and co-produced the feature film Never Never Land. Never Never Land (1979) originally known as Second to the Right and Straight on Until Morning starred Petula Clark and Anne Seymour as a seven-year-old girl, unhappy and isolated as a result of her parents' divorce, she escapes by recreating a modern-day version of the Peter Pan myth. = Thames Television = In 1983, she returned to England to become controller of children's programmes at Thames Television. She was critical of what she saw as the dumbing down of television, believing it had lost its confidence both as an educator of children's minds and as a catalyst for their imaginations. Nevertheless, at Thames she set to work with her usual enthusiasm and energy to try to improve things, and was able to bring some highly stimulating work to the screen. Among this was the series The Wall Game, which had classes of schoolchildren involved in constructional building and improvisation. The series was chosen to represent Britain at the 1985 Tokyo World Fair. The T-Bag was set round a wicked witch and a small boy who assists her, while C.A.B. was a mystery detection series for 8 to 11-year- olds.  T-Bag  Lee Pressman one of the writers on T-bag, recounted: > the idea for the series started when the head of children's television at > Thames, Marjorie Sigley, decided that she wanted to make a series of > \\"educational\\" shows about words and letters of the alphabet. The first of > the shows was \\"Words words words\\", a mishmash of cobbled together sketches, > songs and poems. I had been writing BBC's \\"Play Away\\" (a far superior light > entertainment fest), and Thames TV blatantly asked me whether I had any > unused stuff in my bottom drawer that I could contribute to \\"Words\\" since > they were a tad short on material. Little did I know that many other writers > were being asked the very same question... and one of them was Grant Cathro. > And that's where we met.After that short-lived series, Marjorie asked me to > come up with an idea that would feature letters of the alphabet this time. I > pitched something which I believe was called \\"Dotty in Dictionaria\\" ‚Äì a > story about a young girl who travels across a board game where every square > features a different letter of the alphabet. There were various suggestions > for adventures such as \\"Revenge of the Killer B\\" on the 'B' square, etc. and > so on.When I was given the go ahead to develop the series (at very short > notice), I contacted Grant and asked if he wanted to help write it. Another writer of the series, Grant Cathro corroborated: > Lee and I first met in a South London rehearsal room, where five frantic > grinning actors were hurriedly trying to learn their parts in comedy > sketches which Lee and I had been commissioned to write independently. The > show was called \\"Words, Words, Words\\" (or as it became affectionately known, > \\"Worst, Worst, Worst\\"), the brainchild of Marjorie Sigley, Head of > Children's Programmes at Thames TV. She was trying to disguise education- > based material as pure light entertainment, which seemed quite an > interesting challenge. Other writers were involved too, but somehow Lee and > I became the main contributors and so we began seeing a lot of each other's > work at the following readthroughs. I thought Lee's stuff was annoyingly > good, and he thought my stuff was irritatingly splendid, so when Lee was > later given the go-ahead to develop a comedy-drama which shared similar > aspirations to the one-off \\"Words\\" series, he rang and asked if I would like > to collaborate. Up until this time I had trained and worked mostly as an > actor (Glasgow Citizens Theatre, Lyric Hammersmith, Royal Shakespeare > Company) but because I also loved writing (and had a tax bill to pay) I > immediately said \\"certainly\\". Art and later life Marjorie was also a very talented artist ‚Äì she worked in a variety of mediums particularly favouring printmaking. Her subjects were predominantly influenced by the theatre, and were bold and expressive especially in the use of colour and the large format she favoured. After leaving Thames in 1986 she maintained both her live drama and television work, but devoted a larger amount of time to her artwork. In the late 1980s an exhibition of her work titled Recent Prints was held at the Footstool Gallery, St John Smith Square, London. In 1994, when her cancer was diagnosed, she bought a computer and desk-top published children's books about two stage- struck teddy bears. The dauntless spirit of her heroes Algie and Worthing reflects Sigley's own untiring curiosity, her humour, and her love affair with her work.The Guardian, 10 September 1997 Marjorie died of cancer aged 68 on 13 August 1997. In 1999 a play Marjorie adapted was posthumously published in an anthology of festive plays. The Mummers' play was originally adapted by Marjorie for presentation by students and faculty of the H.B. Studio, a theatre school in New York City as a holiday gift to their families and friends.Saint George and the dragon at Christmas tide (anonymous) adapted by Marjorie Sigley in Swortzell, L. (eds) The twelve plays of Christmas The play begins as men of the village arrive in the local tavern to be cast in an amateur production of St. George and the Dragon. Silliness reigns as the participants are cast in their roles for a variety of reasons‚Äînone of which have anything to do with talent. The second act is the performance of the play, granting \\"real\\" actors an opportunity to play wonderfully broad and physical comedy. The play does require a large cast of eighteen or more. All action takes place within the confines of the village hall, with minimal props. This script offers an excellent opportunity for ensemble work. It does require the cast to sing, but great musical skill is not a necessity.

It is a northward extension of Portland Inlet, other branches of which include the Portland Canal. The entrance of Observatory Inlet, from Portland Inlet, lies between Ramsden Point and Nass Point. Ramsden Point also marks, to the west, the entrance of Portland Canal. Observatory Inlet was named by George Vancouver in 1793, because he set up his observatory on the shore of the inlet, at Salmon Cove, in order to calibrate his chronometers. His two vessels, HMS Discovery and HMS Chatham, stayed in Salmon Cove from July 23 to August 17, 1793. During this time a boat surveying expedition under Vancouver himself explored Behm Canal. Vancouver also named three headlands at the entrance of Observatory Inlet: Maskelyne Point, for Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, Wales Point, for William Wales, the mathematical master who sailed with James Cook, and Ramsden Point, after the famed mathematical instrument-maker Jesse Ramsden. Geography Observatory Inlet has two main arms, the northwest and longer one being named Hastings Arm, fed by the Kshwan River, and Alice Arm, an east arm, fed by the Kitsault River. Hastings Arm is approximately in length, and runs on a nearly true north‚Äìsouth axis, Alice Arm is approximately in length and bends sharply, running on a roughly northeast‚Äìsouthwest axis. From their merger to the mouth of Observatory Inlet is approximately in length, running south-southwest to its merger with the Portland Canal just southwest of Nass Bay, which is an arm of Observatory Inlet and the saltwater outer estuary of the Nass River. Of many islands in the inlet, Granby Island and Brooke Island are located at the intersection of the Hastings and Alice Arms. Granby Island and Granby Bay are named for Granby Consolidated Mining, Smelting and Power Company, which built and operated the mining town of Anyox, located on Granby Bay. Settlements At the aperture of Nass Bay is the community of Arrandale on its southern point, with the community of GingÃ±olx (Kincolith) located on its northern shore just inside the bay at the mouth of the Kincolith River. Also entering the Nass estuary just to its east is the Iknouk River. The smelter ghost town of Anyox is located on the west side of the inlet at Granby Bay, which marks the beginning of Hastings Arm. The locality of Alice Arm, which is a former steamer landing and on the west bank of the mouth of the Kitsault River, is located at the head of the inlet's Alice Arm projection. The former mining town of Kitsault is located due south of Alice Arm, on the far side of the inlet's shoreline. With no rail nor road connection to the rest of British Columbia, these mining towns relied on shipping through Observatory Inlet. Adjacent to the community of Alice Arm, but on the east side of the Kitsault River, is the Nisga'a village of Gits'oolh (formerly Gitzault Indian Reserve No. 24).

In most cases (but not necessarily) this means a coalition of the Union (consisting of the sister parties CDU and CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD).http://www.zpol.nomos.de/fileadmin/zpol/doc/Aufsatz_ZPol_09_01.pdf Weimar Republic (1919‚Äì1933) In the Weimar Republic of 1919 to 1933, the term \\"grand coalition\\" was used for a coalition that included the Social Democratic Party, SPD, the Catholic Centre Party and the liberal parties Democratic Party, DDP and People's Party, DVP. Such a coalition was in power in 1923 and from 1928 until 1930, although the latter was a conglomerate of parties with somewhat conflicting interests, that banded together to as a safeguard for democracy against the radical political parties, the KPD and the NSDAP. In March 1930, the Great Coalition broke apart, with the resignation of the SPD over the contentious issue of increasing employee's national insurance contributions at a time when wages were falling.'The Third Reich' by D.G. Williamson Federal Republic (1949‚Äì) Ten years after their coalition: Willy Brandt (left) and Kurt Georg Kiesinger (center), with then Chancellor Helmut Schmidt (right) = Federal level = In the post-war politics of Germany, four grand coalitions (Gro√üe Koalitionen) have been formed at the federal level through the Bundestag.  Kiesinger cabinet (1966‚Äì1969)  On 1 December 1966, the government was formed by the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, the two major political parties in the Federal Republic of Germany. It was the result of arguments about tax increases between the CDU/CSU‚ÄìFDP coalition of the time. The FDP ministers stood down and a new government was formed with the SPD under Kurt Georg Kiesinger of the CDU. The grand coalition was in control of 90% of the Bundestag (468 of 518 seats), leaving some politically active students disillusioned; this disillusionment led to the formation of the Au√üerparlamentarische Opposition which formed a core of the German student movement. The Kiesinger grand coalition lasted until 1969.  1st, 3rd and 4th Merkel cabinet (2005‚Äì2009, 2013‚Äì2018, 2018‚Äì)  After the inconclusive result of the 2005 German federal election, neither of the traditional coalitions could form a majority government. Another possible coalition existed, comprising the SPD, Greens, and the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), but a desire to exclude the PDS, the successor party to East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party, from government (i.e. a cordon sanitaire) led the leaders of the SPD and the CDU/CSU to agree to form a grand coalition with CDU leader Angela Merkel as chancellor and an equal number of cabinet seats for each party. The chancellor was elected on 22 November, and the 1st Merkel Cabinet took office. The second grand coalition in German history ended when, after the 2009 federal election, a coalition was agreed between the CDU/CSU and the FDP, thus forming the 2nd Merkel Cabinet. Following the 2013 election, on 27 November 2013 a third grand coalition was formed by the CDU/CSU and the SPD. Again it would have been possible to form a center-left government with the SPD, Greens, and The Left, the successor party to the PDS, but a grand coalition was formed instead. The term GroKo (shortening for Gro√üe Koalition) was named 2013 word of the year in Germany. = State level = Historically grand coalitions have been quite frequent on state level. Currently, there are only four states out of sixteen, which have never been governed by a grand coalition: *Hamburg *North Rhine-Westphalia *Saxony *Saxony-Anhalt As of January 2020, five states are currently governed by grand coalitions: *Baden- W√ºrttemberg, the 2nd Kretschmann cabinet supported by Alliance 90/The Greens and the CDU (in office since May 2016). *Lower Saxony, the 2nd Weil cabinet supported by SPD and CDU (in office since November 2017). *Mecklenburg- Vorpommern, the Schwesig cabinet supported by SPD and CDU (in office since July 2017, became a grand coalition in September 2017, after the AfD-group in the state parliament had split up, which led to the CDU becoming second party). *Saarland, the Hans cabinet supported by CDU and SPD (in office since March 2018). *Hesse, the 3rd Bouffier cabinet supported by CDU and Alliance 90/The Greens (in office since January 2019). Historically, three other grand coalition governments on state level, apart from the current governments of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Hesse, consisting of other parties than CDU/CSU and SPD have existed: *Brandenburg, the 3rd Platzeck cabinet supported of by SPD and The Left (2009-2013), the 1st Woidke cabinet supported by SPD and The Left (2013-2014) *Bremen, the 3rd B√∂hrnsen senate supported by SPD and Alliance '90/The Greens (2011-2015) See also * Historic Compromise (Italy) * Jamaica coalition (politics) ReferencesFurther reading * * Category:Christian Democratic Union of Germany Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany ","title":"Grand coalition (Germany)"},{"id":"21655149","text":"R.

Bino was the first person killed during violence associated with the 2009 French Caribbean general strikes. Bino was active participant in the first month of the general strikes in Guadeloupe. However, Bino was shot and killed shortly after midnight on Wednesday, February 18, 2009, as he drove home from a protest. Bino approached a group of armed youths who were manning a makeshift barricade in the city of Pointe-√†-Pitre. The crowd opened fire on Bino's car. Bino's car was hit three times by 12-gauge Brenneke-style shotgun slugs. One of the shotgun blasts came through the front windshield of the car, striking Bino in the chest and killing him. There were no police in the area when Bino was killed. Jean- Michel Pretre, a local Guadeloupean prosecutor, has speculated that the youths, who were operating independently from the official strikes, may have mistaken Bino for a plainclothes police officer when they opened fire. Point- √†-Pitre Mayor Jacques Bangou noted following Bino's death that, \\"For the past 48 hours the streets have been in the hands of groups of young people, completely out of control.\\" Bino's murder may have marked a turning point in the general strikes, with both the French government and the LKP union groups beginning to take serious notice of the conflict. Bino's funeral was held on Sunday, February 22, 2009. His funeral was attended by former French Socialist presidential candidate S√©gol√®ne Royal, who arrived on Saturday to attend his memorial service. Royal used the solemn occasion to criticize the government of French President Nicolas Sarkozy saying the government had \\"abandoned\\" Guadeloupe and urging it to find ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to the crisis.\\" Jacques Bino was 50 years old at the time of his murder. He was survived by his wife, Marie- Antoinette Bino, who lives in Pointe-√†-Pitre.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Ball, to the west. History Mount Brett was named in 1916 for Robert Brett (1851‚Äì1929). Doctor Brett was a surgeon who first came to Banff in 1885. He later served as the second Lieutenant Governor of Alberta starting in 1915. The first ascent of Mount Brett was made in 1916 by C.F. Hogeboom, A.H. Bent, James Outram, E.G. Ritchie, and K.D. McClelland. The mountain's name became official on November 2, 1956 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Brett is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Brett is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Brett drains into tributaries of the Bow River, which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River.

P√®re Dagobert) was a Capuchin friar who arrived in New Orleans from Quebec in 1722. In 1745, he became priest of St. Louis Cathedral, and later was appointed as vicar general of the diocese. He was active regionally for over 50 years and died in 1776. While largely overlooked today, his contributions to New Orleans and its people are significant and enduring. One finds numerous references to him in historical accounts of 18th-century New Orleans, and despite sometimes conflicting information, it is agreed by the majority of historians that he was a seminal figure in the spiritual and social life of the city. Following are some themes that reoccur throughout historical documents. He was: * Regarded as a great champion of the poor, and beloved by the people of New Orleans A Catholic history of Alabama and the Floridas, Volume 1 * Praised for his kindness and love of the people of New Orleans, and their customs. * A little \\"rotund\\" and described as \\"jolly.\\" * A great lover of food and wine, and was even described as a \\"gastronome.\\" * Criticized by the Spanish clergy for being too lax with regard to Catholic ritual. * Non-traditional in that he wore a tricorn hat and other non-sanctioned garb.New Orleans; the Place and the People, Grace Elizabeth King - 1895 * Noted for celebrating births and marriages at homes of his parishioners, and even frequented taverns. * In charge of Charity Hospital for 8 years in the 1750s * Quite famous regionally and even somewhat nationally well into the 20th century. The consensus in historical texts is that his substantial political and social influence came, in large part, from his popularity. 1\\\\.

Salvia scabra was introduced to California gardens around 1996, and is extremely adaptable to many types of conditions. Since then it has spread to gardens in England, France, and Italy. Salvia scabra reaches 3 feet in height in the wild, and about 1.5 feet in cultivation, developing woody stems that are pale brown, round, and covered with short hairs. The leaves are lyre-shaped and lobed, with the lobes becoming more pronounced as the plant matures. The mid-green leaves appear to grow in thick bunches and have a rough surface, which explains the specific epithet scabra. The inflorescences are short, with up to six flower per whorl. The .5 inch flowers are long, straight, and tube-shaped and vary in color from pale pink to pale lilac, with a short hairy calyx that is tinged purple.

Note that the gaff is fixed on the first mast and that it has one leg on both sides of the sail. A wishbone rig, sometimes also known as fishbone ketch, is a type of rigging on sailboats. This rigging is most popular on heavy two-masted vessels. The rig gets its name from the wishbone, a V or Y shaped bone similar to the rig's gaff. A ketch rigged in this fashion is called wishbone ketch. Examples of wishbone- rigged boats include the Zawisza Czarny and the Norda. Definition A wishbone ketch rigged vessel is a vessel that is rigged as a ketch where a permanent splitting gaff is mounted between two masts. Contrary to the gaff rig (where the gaff is hoisted together with the sail) the gaff stays in the mast. The gaff is typically fixed on the first mast (the one closer to the front) and fixed via a line to the aftmost mast. These lines allow the sail to be trimmed to suit the wind. Advantages and disadvantages Advantages: * Easier to hoist the sail than with a gaff rig * Offers a large sail area (advantageous in light winds) - the entire area between the masts can be covered Disadvantages: * Potential dangerous situation in case of unplanned jibe, therefore difficult to use in broad reach (see points of sail) * Puts significant strain on the top of the aft most mast * Additional weight high in the mast (although this rig is generally used only on heavy boats)  See also  * Sail-plan * Ketch Category:Sailing rigs and rigging Category:Ship types Category:Sailboat types ","title":"Wishbone rig"},{"id":"21655392","text":"200px Play Without Words is a 2002 ballet by English choreographer Matthew Bourne with music by Terry Davies.

He moved frequently during his youth, eventually settling in Frankfort, Kentucky, in 1984 where he attended high school. He became increasingly serious about his musical studies, and also began competing in various musical competitions. He experimented with composition, and soon found a new passion for conducting as a result of programs in his school and his contact in 1987 with Larry Rachelff. During this time, in addition to performing in orchestras, bands, jazz bands, and choirs, he began performing as an actor in numerous productions in the Frankfort Youth Theatre and other youth theatre programs, and in school. He also began competing and winning prizes as an actor in state competitions in performances of scenes from various works including Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, and Peter Shaffer's Equus.  Post secondary academic education  He began his undergraduate studies in music performance at the University of North Texas College of Music in 1987, after attending the Interlochen Arts Camp for the first time as a student, where he performed in various ensembles, the jazz band, and as a conductor. While an undergraduate student in performance, he became increasingly involved with conducting and was invited to student conduct the University of North Texas Symphony Orchestra in a performance while he was still in school. In September 1992, Noe performed as a soloist with the College of Music Symphony Orchestra as one of five winners of the Annual Concerto Competition.Concert Program: Symphony and Chamber Orchestras, University of North Texas College of Music, September 30, 1992 In 1990, Noe moved to London, England, where he enrolled in music studies at the University of Surrey, as a part of a foreign exchange program. While in England, he performed in various ensembles, performed as a soloist with the university orchestra, and continued his conducting studies. He spent considerable time cultivating new passions for both opera ‚Äì through dozens of performances he attended at the English National Opera, and New Music as well as continuing his passion for the theatre.

They were originally established in the power-seizure movement as a replacement system of government to the old Party apparatus, but quickly became subordinate to it. Background As the spirit of the Cultural Revolution spread across China in the latter half of 1966, it soon became clear to the Maoist leadership in Beijing that the ability of local party organizations and officials to resist the attempts by the Red Guards to remove them from power was greater than had been thought.Meisner, p. 341 As a result, Mao Zedong proposed dramatic seizures of power by the various Red Guard and workers' groups and the establishment of new local governments based on Karl Marx's Paris Commune model. The first of these planned power seizures was to come with the founding of the Shanghai Commune in February 1967.Meisner, p. 348 However, in January and February 1967, in Shanxi province and in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, two other power seizures of power had occurred, with People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers assisting workers and the Red Guards in overthrowing the old Communist Party of China (CCP) authorities - the Harbin revolutionary committee (established on 1 February) was to be the first to be endorsed by Beijing.Karnow, p. 289 In both cases, the victors had established 'triple alliances' of the rebel people's organisations, the army and CCP cadres. These alliances were soon to be known as revolutionary committees.Meisner, p. 348 The central leadership including Mao Zedong, who had originally advocated the commune system of government, was attracted to this new type of government, and by the end of February it had publicly stated that revolutionary committees were the only acceptable way of reorganising government.Meisner, p. 348Karnow, p. 287 Role during the Cultural Revolution With the decision of the central leadership to support the concept of revolutionary committees, from February 1967 onwards mass organisations were encouraged to ally with cadres and the army to establish this new type of government. However, by the end of April 1967, only six of China's twenty-seven provinces (Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Guizhou and Shandong)Meisner, p. 352 and 353 had established revolutionary committees with official approval, due to the continued resistance by old CCP organisations and the lack of agreement amongst mass organisations and the PLA over which party cadres were appropriate choices for the committees.Short, p. 573 By the end of 1967, only two more revolutionary committees (in Inner Mongolia and in the city of Tianjin) had been formed, despite a call from Mao in September for the forging of these alliances.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 240 Following the founding of nine more revolutionary committees (including in Fujian and Jiangxi provinces) by March,Karnow, p. 415 in the summer of 1968, as the Red Guard movement was virtually extinguished by PLA suppression,Meisner, p. 362 in an effort to restore some unity to the Cultural Revolution there was another drive by the leadership to establish provincial level revolutionary committees. As a result, by the end of September 1968, all of China's provinces and autonomous regions had provincial-level organisations in place (with the last revolutionary committee being formed in Xinjiang provinceMacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 240), and these groups were given the task of facilitating the establishment of similarly structured committees at a district, county and municipal level.Meisner, p. 362 The majority of revolutionary committees created rapidly came to be dominated by the PLA,Karnow, p. 277 because the army had military force at its disposal to enforce its will. For example, in the leadership of the revolutionary committee in Shanghai, seven out of the thirteen members were army officers.Karnow, p. 298 Twenty out of twenty-nine provincial revolutionary committees were chaired PLA officers, and in several provinces PLA soldiers chaired up to 98% of revolutionary committees above the county level.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 246 More often than not, in the interests of stability and order, the PLA allied with cadres on the revolutionary committees against the more radical organisations of the masses.Meisner, p. 351 Therefore, at the end of September 1968, only revolutionary committees in Shaanxi and Hubei provinces were chaired by civilians.Meisner, p. 363 Furthermore, the majority of those that sat on the revolutionary committees as representatives of the people were those who had had a stake in the pre- Cultural Revolution order of things rather than radicals from the movement itself. By 1969, it was also the case that both urban and rural revolutionary committees at all levels quickly became subordinate to existing or revived Party committees.Meisner, p.375 and 384 The leadership of both organisations was often almost identical, and revolutionary committees became little more than instruments of the Party committees' bidding. This was particularly evident with the factory revolutionary committees- heralded as one of the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution, they were often little more than bureaucratic extensions of Party power.Meisner, p. 384-385 and 389 Role after the Cultural Revolution With the winding down of the radical phase of the Cultural Revolution in 1969 and 1970, the revolutionary committees became increasingly bureaucratic and an organisational and ideological formality.Meisner, p. 407 Although originally tasked with the representation of the Cultural Revolution's mass organisations (the Red Guards and the worker's groups), the dispersal of these mass groups made the revolutionary committees increasingly defunct, especially as the Party had regained administrative control of China.Meisner, p. 407 However, they were maintained for their increasingly effective bureaucratic role (they were more efficient than the conventional Party apparatus of governmentMacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 239) and as the leadership did not want to undermine the ideological success of the Cultural Revolution.Meisner, p. 407 The future role of the revolutionary committees was to be formalised at the Fourth National People's Congress held in January 1975. This congress ratified a new version of the constitution of the People's Republic of China, in which the revolutionary committees were established as permanent fixtures of the country's administration, but they were not given any role in the formulation of policy. In addition, the three members of the 'triple alliance' principle on which the revolutionary committees were founded were redefined as 'the old, the middle aged and the young'.Meisner, p. 418 However, in 1978, after an eleven-year history, revolutionary committees were abolished by the post-Mao government.Chesneaux, p. 191  See also  * Power seizure * January Storm * Violent Struggle NotesReferences *Chesneaux, J; 'China: The People's Republic, 1949-1976'; Harvester Press (1979) *Karnow, S; 'Mao and China: Inside China's Cultural Revolution; Penguin (1984) *Meisner, M; 'Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic Since 1949'; Free Press (1986) *MacFarquhar, R and Schoenhals, M; 'Mao's Last Revolution'; Belknap Harvard (2006) *Short, P; 'Mao: A Life'; John Murray (2004) Category:Cultural Revolution ","title":"Revolutionary committee (China)"},{"id":"21655925","title":"Hans-Peter Gies"},{"id":"21655934","text":"Marian TƒÉnasƒÉ (born 14 August 1985) is a Romanian former footballer who played as a forward for teams such as FCM BacƒÉu, O»õelul Gala»õi or FCMU Baia Mare, among others.

Location and access  The crane sanctuary is located in north western Cambodia, not far from the border with Thailand. The entire 10,000 hectares of the protected area is contained within Phnom Srok District of Banteay Meanchey Province. Phnom Srok district shares a border with Siem Reap and Oddar Meanchey Provinces. Reading from the north clockwise, Phnom Srok borders with Banteay Ampil and Chong Kal districts of Oddar Meanchey province to the north. The eastern border of the district is shared with Srei Snam and Kralanh districts of Siem Reap province. To the south the district shares a border with Preah Net Preah District of Banteay Meanchey. The western border of the district joins with Svay Chek and Thmor Pouk districts also of Banteay Meanchey. The sanctuary can be accessed by road from Sisophon (70 km) or Siem Reap (city) (90 km) via National Highway 6 initially then via smaller unsealed district roads to Ang Trapaing Thmor.

It was founded in February 1995 on the initiative of Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev, the 'architect of perestroika', who in 1994 had called for forming a united movement of Russian social democrats. At first it seemed that many notable perestroika era politicians with social-democratic or 'generally democratic' views would join the new organization. Among them were A. Golov (leader of the Social Democratic Party of Russia), P.Bunich (Party of Democratic Initiative), I. Kivelidi (leader of the Russian Party of Free Labor), G. Popov (Movement of Democratic Reforms), Y.Chernichenko (Peasant Party of Russia). However, hardly any of them joined the party when its congress took place on 18 February 1995. Alexander Yakovlev was elected as the chairman, the party's programme emphasised 'social partnership', and at the same time supported constructive co-operation with the government and president Yeltsin. In August 1995, the Party of Social Democracy joined Democratic Choice of Russia, Peasant Party of Russia and similar organisations, forming the Democratic Choice of Russia - United Democrats bloc. No RPSD members were elected. At the moment of registration (April 1995) the party had 4,700 members with little support outside Moscow.

Uglanov was closely associated with the so-called \\"Right Deviation\\" associated with Soviet party leader Nikolai Bukharin and he fell from his leadership position during the mass collectivization campaign of 1929. Uglanov was arrested in the summer of 1936 and was executed the following spring during the secret police terror of 1937‚Äì38. BiographyEarly years= Nikolai Aleksandrovich Uglanov was born 5 December 1886 to an ethnic Russian peasant family in the village of Feodoritskoye in Yaroslavl Governorate, located approximately 250 kilometers (160 mi) northeast of Moscow. His father Aleksander Uglanov supplemented the family income by working seasonally in the city of St. Petersburg and at the age of 12 Nikolai followed him there, working as an apprentice metal worker.Catherine Merridale, Moscow Politics and the Rise of Stalin: The Communist Party in the Capital, 1925-32. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1990; pg. 29. Nikolai moved between jobs with some regularity and often returned home to Yaroslavl in between jobs. Uglanov was introduced to radical ideas at an early age, beginning his participation in the revolutionary movement in 1903, distributing illegal literature and storing sensitive documents for underground activists. Uglanov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party himself in 1907. As a young party activist Uglanov contributed material to the Bolshevik party paper Pravda as a worker- correspondent. Uglanov was arrested for the first time by the Okhrana early in the summer of 1914 but he was subsequently released from captivity and inducted into the Army and sent to the front lines to fight for the Tsarist regime in World War I. In November 1914 Uglanov was severely wounded and was returned to Petrograd (St. Petersburg), where he recovered and resumed his secret revolutionary activity. =Career= During the Russian revolution Uglanov was a member of the Petrograd Soviet. Uglanov became a functionary in the Soviet trade union movement and was selected as the head of the Petrograd Guberniia council of trade unions in 1919.' In February 1921 Uglanov succeeded Sergey ZorinWorld Statesmen.org; Leningrad as secretary of the Petrograd guberniia committee of the Russian Communist Party [RKP(b)].

He served on the faculty of the University of New Mexico, held several concurrent teaching, chair, and dean positions at The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) from 1940 until his death. Sanchez also acted as the 13th president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), while spearheading several landmark civil right aimed court cases focusing on equal educational opportunities for Chicano Americans and opposing the use of racially-biased standardized tests based on non-proficiency in English. Sanchez is remembered as a leading figure in the early \\"Mexican- American/Chicano\\" movement, which culminated during World War II, after heavy involvement with and collaboration between Chicano-Americans and Latin Americans through The Office of Inter-American Affairs. In 1998, the UT Austin Education building (SZB) was renamed in his honor. BiographyEarly life= George Isidoro S√°nchez was born on October 4, 1906, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During his early years, his family moved to Arizona, following his father's occupation as both a gold and copper miner. The longest settled period of time George enjoyed as a child happened to be in Jerome, Arizona, now a ghost town, but at the time was known as William A. Clark's copper mining boom town, with shipments moving hourly towards Clark County in Las Vegas, Nevada. His early experiences in a notorious mining company owned town, full of constant human suffering at the hands of a single industrial capitalist may have helped shape his gift for public service in the name of the human race. In 1921, they traveled back to Albuquerque when S√°nchez finished ninth grade, so that he was able to finish out his high school career at Albuquerque High School. When he graduated, he worked as a part-time student for seven years at the University of New Mexico, all the while teaching at the surrounding public county school systems. In 1930, S√°nchez graduated cum laude from the University of New Mexico with a Bachelor of Arts in education and Spanish. In 1931, he graduated with a Master of Science in educational psychology and Spanish from The University of Texas at Austin. In 1935, he finally obtained a Doctor of Education in educational administration from the University of California at Berkley. =Career= S√°nchez published his best-known work, Forgotten People: A Study of New Mexicans, in 1940. This book was the first to use sociological methods to document the concerns and experiences of \\"New Mexicans.\\"John Ch√°vez, The Lost Land: The Chicano Image of the Southwest, (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1984), p. 101. S√°nchez criticized the inclination to romanticize New Mexico and its people while at the same time ignoring the grinding poverty in the state. He also challenged the U.S. government to address the basic needs of the people, who he said had always been loyal to the nation. S√°nchez gained his greatest accolades after 1940. In that year, he accepted a position as a full professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He was the university's first professor Latin American Studies and later served as the chair of the department of history and philosophy. The year after arriving in Austin, S√°nchez was elected national president of LULAC although he only served one term from 1941 to 1942. =Death and legacy= S√°nchez died on April 5, 1972. Among many honors in his memory, the National Education Association sponsored the George I. S√°nchez Memorial Award to recognize him as the \\"father of the movement for quality education for Mexican-Americans\\"; the United States Office of Education named a work section and a room in the new United States Office of Education Building for him; schools in Houston, San Antonio, and Austin, Texas, were named for him; and in 1995 the University of Texas rededicated its Education Building as the George I. S√°nchez Building. S√°nchez was a specialist in mental measurements and bilingual education and a critic of culture bias in the intelligence tests of the day. He has been called the founder of Chicano educational psychology, and is still given much credit in regards to his methodical studies on bilingual education, which are still a basis of study in the current field.

The town hall, which is the headquarters for Islington London Borough Council, is a Grade II listed building. History The building was commissioned to replace the ageing mid-19th century vestry hall on Upper Street which had been used by the Parish of St Mary's, Islington. The vestry hall had become the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington in 1900. After the vestry hall had become inadequate for the council's needs, civic leaders decided to procure a new town hall; they purchased a site with a row of Georgian era terraced houses known as Tyndale Place for this purpose in 1920. The new building was designed by Edward Charles Philip Monson in the neoclassical style and built in three stages: first the rear wing facing Richmond Grove in 1922, second the northern part in Upper Street in 1925 and third the assembly hall in 1929. The complex was officially opened by the mayor, Alderman William Manchester, on 15 March 1930. The design for the northern section involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing onto Upper Street; it featured a stone porch with the borough coat of arms above flanked by full-height windows and Corinthian order pilasters to either side; there was also a window in a similar style on the first floor above the doorway. The principal rooms were the mayor's parlour, which was in the rear wing facing Richmond Grove, and the council chamber, which was in the northern part in Upper Street. Pevsner was impressed by the \\"lavish marble imperial stair to the octagonal council chamber\\". Since 1930, when Arsenal won their first FA Cup against Huddersfield Town, victory receptions have been held at the town hall. Queen Elizabeth II visited the town hall and met with civic leaders to mark her coronation in 1953. The building served as the town hall of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington and continued to serve as the local seat of government after Islington London Borough Council was formed in 1965. However, the council moved many of its officers and their departments to new municipal offices designed by T P Bennett on the opposite side of Upper Street in 1983. Other developments in the 1980s included an underground bunker constructed for protection against nuclear attack. Islington Museum, which had previously been based in the town hall, moved out of the building in preparation for its move to Finsbury Library in December 2006. The town hall hosted a high-profile reception, attended by the Duchess of Cambridge, to promote Chance UK's early intervention child mentoring program in October 2015.

Interior of Rouses Market in New Orleans Central Business District, 2011. In 1960, Anthony Rouse, Sr. (son of J. P. Rouse) and his cousin, Ciro DiMarco, opened a grocery store in Houma, Louisiana. In the 1970s, Ciro decided to exit the business and sold his portion of the business to Anthony's son, Ryan Rouse. In the late 1970s Anthony's son Tommy also joined the business. Throughout the 1970s, the company operated stores in Houma, Raceland and the Rouses‚Äô hometown of Thibodaux. During the 1980s, the company opened more new stores in South Louisiana, in the communities of Lockport, Cut Off and Morgan City. Rouses opened its first store in Metairie in 1995 and was then the largest independent grocer in Louisiana. In 2003, Rouses opened a store in Covington.

A native of Warsaw, he assisted Nikolay Milyutin in reforming the administration of Congress Poland. In the late 1850s, he was a Russian diplomatic agent in Bosnia; he published several books about the country and its folklore, thanks to the collaborative efforts of Prokopije ƒåokorilo. Hilferding was elected into the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1856. He died of typhoid while collecting folk songs in Kargopol, in the north of European Russia, and was later reburied in the Novodevichy Cemetery, St. Petersburg. Hilferding's collection of Slavonic manuscripts is preserved in the Russian National Library.http://www.nlr.ru/eng/coll/manuscripts/rus_manus.html?print=1  Kashubian studies  Hilferding is credited with having coined the term Slovincians (Polish, S≈Çowi≈Ñcy) to describe the Lutheranized Wends of Hinter Pomerania (also sometimes called Lebakaschuben). The story has spread all over the Internet, but it seems unlikely that he actually did so. The term Slovincian evidently existed long before Hilferding's time. The Lutheran pastors Simon Krofey (1586) and Michael Pontanus (German, Br√ºggemann; 1643) speak of a slowinzischen language (which they call wendisch in German and‚Äîby mistaken association‚Äîvandalicus in Latin).Franz Tetzner, Die Slawen in Deutschland; beitr√§ge zur volkskunde der Preussen, Litauer und Letten, der Masuren und Philipponen, der Tschechen, M√§grer und Sorben, Polaben und Slowinzen, Kaschuben und Polen.

Friederich von Dreger, Prussian Kriegs- und Dom√§nenrat in Pomerania, wrote in 1748: ‚ÄúDie meisten D√∂rfer, sonderlich in Hinterpommern, sind von Wenden bewohnt geblieben, wie denn auch jenseits dem Stolpischen Fluss die wendische Sprache von den Bauern noch gebraucht, auch noch der Gottesdienst in selbiger gehalten wird, welche Sprache man irrig die cassubische heisst, weil Cassuben, Pommern, Pohlen zwar eine sprache gehabt, das eigentliche cassubische Land aber gewesen, wo nun Belgard,. ..

The Slovincians seem, however, to have used the name of themselves as merely a synonym for Cassubian, saying, when asked: \\"Wir sind Slowinzen, Slowinzen und Kaschuben ist dasselbe\\" (We are Slovincians, Slovincians and Kassubians are the same).Quoted by Tetzner, Slawen in Deutschland, p. 390. Florian Ceynowa and Hilferding were not the only ones to study the language and legends of the Kashubians, but they had the greatest influence and prompted others to take up investigations. The individual character of the Kashubian character and language was first described by Hilferding, to whom we are indebted for the first data about the range of Kashubian dialects. In 1856 he travelled to the Kashubia and demarcated the borders of contemporary Kashubian Pomerania. He researched the Kashubian language, describing its properties and origins.  Comparative linguistics  As Hilferding is mostly known for his works on Slovincians, the other important side of his work - research into the relations of Slavonic to Sanskrit is often overlooked. Soon after graduating the St. Petersburg University in 1853, he wrote an Essay –û —Å—Ä–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ —è–∑—ã–∫–∞ —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å —Å–∞–Ω—Å–∫—Ä–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∏–º/O srodstve jazyka slavjanskogo s sanskritskim (On cognition of Slavonic language with Sanskrit). In this work, he made the first scientific and systematic comparison of the phonetic correspondences between the two languages and provided a list of several hundred cognate words. It is particularly important that being an expert in many Slavonic languages and not just Russian, and having knowledge of the Russian dialects, Hilferding did not limit this list to Russian but it embraced all the principal Slavonic languages. Although some of his etymologies have been proven incorrect, his essay stands unsurpassed even today and is unduly forgotten. These are some quotes from the Introduction to this book: \\"Linguistics is yet a very young science. Therefore, although it has attained great achievements in the course of its 36-year existence, there are still considerable gaps in it. One of the most significant gaps is the Slavonic language. The science of Linguistics had its start in Germany and it owes to the German scholars its most important discoveries. It is natural that they, while keeping as the base Sanskrit - the language that has preserved most truthfully the primordial state of the Indo- European tongue, dispersed, distorted or lost in other cognate languages, mainly expounded the languages that were better known to them, namely Greek, Latin and all German dialects. Other languages attracted much less of their attention. Yet it is strange that out of all other languages Slavonic takes the last place in their works. They would rather base their conclusions on the Zend language or Lithuanian or Celtic then on the rich and flourishing language of the tribe occupying the Eastern part of Europe. This phenomenon is hard to explain: they are either unable to lean the Slavonic language (yet they could indeed learn a language which was not known to anybody with unknown writing - the Ancient Persian), or they are lost in the multitude of Slavonic dialects having equal importance for a scientist, or they do not want to touch the subject which should be developed by Slavs themselves. Whatever it was, the comparative linguistics, created in the West by German scientists, does not have the knowledge of the Slavonic language; it only knows that there is a rather rich language in the Indo-European family known as Slavonic. But what is this language? What is its relation to the cognate languages? Do not ask this from the Linguistics of our Western neighbours.\\"–û —Å—Ä–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ —è–∑—ã–∫–∞ —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å —Å–∞–Ω—Å–∫—Ä–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∏–º/O srodstve jazyka slavjanskogo s sanskritskim (On cognation of Slavonic language with Sanskrit), St. Petersburg Academy of Science, 1853, p. 3 - 4 Hilferding believed that it was imperative to study the relations of Slavonic to other Indo-European languages after clearing up the relation between Slavonic and Sanskrit.

Following the restructuring of railway lines in Ramsgate in 1926, the section of line between Broadstairs and Ramsgate Harbour including a tunnel to the seafront at Ramsgate was abandoned. The narrow-gauge Tunnel Railway was opened within the disused tunnel in 1936 to connect tourist attractions and shops near Ramsgate harbour with the new railway main line at Dumpton Park. Except for its two stations‚Äîone at each end of the tunnel‚Äîthe line ran entirely underground. The line was built in less than three months, and on its completion in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it was not included in the 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands. Passenger numbers fell during the 1960s, and the line became economically unviable. Following a train crash in 1965, the owners closed the line at the end of September that year. The tunnel still exists, but no trace remains of either of the two stations. Background The full extent of the railway network in Kent, showing the twin lines from London to Ramsgate and Margate The coastal resort and port town of Ramsgate was historically served by a complex network of unconnected railway lines, the legacy of competition between two rival companies to provide links to London and to neighbouring Margate. The town's first railway station, Ramsgate Town, was opened by the South Eastern Railway on 13 April 1846, on what was then the outskirts of the town, about a mile from the seafront. Lines from the station ran north, before splitting west to Canterbury and on to London, and north to Margate.Harding, p. 4 The London, Chatham and Dover Railway opened a second line to Ramsgate on 5 October 1863. This line ran from London via Herne Bay, Margate and Broadstairs before descending to sea level at Ramsgate through a tunnel to Ramsgate Harbour station, on the seafront immediately adjacent to the harbour. Although very conveniently sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its situation at the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3 August 1891 and 24 March 1915.Mitchell and Smith, ¬ß 107Mitchell and Smith, ¬ß 111 Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.Mitchell and Smith, ¬ß 110 =1926 restructuring= Layout of pre- and post-1926 lines and stations in Ramsgate Following the railway grouping of 1923, both the South Eastern Railway and the London, Chatham & Dover Railway became part of the newly formed Southern Railway, which decided to address the duplication of lines and stations at Ramsgate and Margate. It decided to link the two lines at Ramsgate to allow through running between them. This scheme had been proposed by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway before World War I, but work did not commence until 1925.Mitchell and Smith, ¬ß 104 This meant the closure of the terminus stations at Ramsgate Town and Ramsgate Harbour, and the construction of a line skirting the northern edge of the town to link the two existing lines. New stations on the north-eastern and north-western fringes of the town, called Dumpton Park and Ramsgate respectively, replaced the existing stations in the town centre and at the harbour.Harding, p. 6 Construction work on the new line involved over 700 men moving of chalk, at a cost of approximately ¬£500,000 (¬£ in ).Mitchell and Smith, ¬ß 105 The new link opened on 2 July 1926, from which date both former Ramsgate stations were closed along with the line through the tunnel to Ramsgate Harbour. The tunnel was sealed and abandoned, and the former Ramsgate Harbour station was sold to Thanet Amusements, who converted it into a zoo and funfair called Merrie England.Harding, p. 7 Although adequate for the town's residents the new stations were a long way from the seafront attractions, which were at the foot of a steep hill. The day-trippers on whom Ramsgate's tourist industry depended were therefore increasingly attracted to Margate, where the station was next to the beach. By 1933 Merrie England, now under the ownership of Ramsgate Olympia, had become extremely popular, and Ramsgate Olympia began to lobby the Southern Railway to reopen the line through the tunnel, with a new junction station between Dumpton Park and Broadstairs.Harding, p. 8 However, the Southern Railway rejected the proposal as too costly and impractical. Ramsgate Olympia and the Southern Railway were keen to make the attractions near the harbour accessible from the railway main line and to provide a service from the seafront to the greyhound stadium at Dumpton Park. The two companies eventually agreed on a scheme by which a new line would use the of the tunnel nearest the beach, before branching off into a new tunnel to emerge at a new station at Hereson Road, a walk from Dumpton Park station. Ramsgate Olympia planned the construction of a large-scale housing estate, charabanc parking facilities, and a 10,000-seat stadium at Dumpton Park to increase passenger numbers and encourage people to use the new rail line. =Route= Trains at the lower station, immediately outside the tunnel entrance The stations each had three platforms; a broad island platform in the centre for passengers waiting to board trains, and narrower outer platforms from which passengers exited the trains. Although the upper station was known as Hereson Road from the outset, the lower station was never officially named. It was known at various times as \\"Olympia\\", \\"Beach\\", \\"Sands\\" and \\"Lower Terminus\\".Harding, p. 20 The platforms and ticket offices were immediately outside the mouth of the tunnel at both stations. The line ran between Hereson Road, across the road from Dumpton Park station, down a steep gradient of in the new tunnel, before running at a gradient down the original tunnel to the lower terminus. The line consisted of a single line, branching into two platform tracks at the two stations, with a crossing loop halfway along the tunnel. Over the journey between Hereson Road and the lower terminus, the line descended .Harding, p. 21 =Construction and infrastructure= The new line's infrastructure was designed by Henry Greenly, a leading figure in the design of narrow gauge railways. He had begun his career at the Metropolitan Railway (now part of the London Underground), and had designed the route, buildings, locomotives and rolling stock for the Rhyl Miniature Railway and the nearby Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.Harding, p. 9 As the new railway would not be carrying heavy loads and would be travelling only a short distance, it was built as a narrow gauge railway, with a track gauge of . This allowed the new branch tunnel to be built to far smaller dimensions than the existing tunnel, at just high and wide. Although a cable haulage system had initially been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided early in the line's planning to electrify the line. A third rail system was rejected due to concerns for the safety of the large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running the length of the tunnel. The wire ran along the wall of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.Harding, p. 24 The junction of the main tunnel and the narrow tunnel to Hereson Road in 1984, 19 years after closure Construction work began on 2 May 1936. The company hoped to have the line open in time to serve the large crowds expected on the August Bank Holiday, leading to a very tight construction deadline of three months. To try to meet the deadline, construction work was carried out both day and night.Harding, p. 10 As the journey would take place entirely underground it was decided to line the wider, original tunnel with illuminated displays showing scenes from around the world. This led to the line becoming semi- officially known as the \\"World Scenic Railway\\". English Electric built two trains for the line, designed to resemble the electric trains already in use on the Southern Railway, but on a smaller scale. A four-car train, painted red, was capable of carrying 108 passengers, and had a driver's cab at each end to avoid the need to turn the train around. A train, painted yellow, was also able to carry 108 passengers, but had two extra driver's cabs in the centre, allowing it to be split into two separate trains, each capable of carrying 54 passengers. It was envisaged that when the line was busy both trains would be used, but during quiet periods the line could be operated by the two-halves of the yellow train.Harding, p. 12 The red train was modified so that it could also be split, reducing its capacity to 102 as the two rows of seats at the centre were replaced by driver's cabs.Harding, p. 13 =Opening= The line opened to passengers on 31 July 1936, less than 12 weeks after construction began.Harding, p. 14 It was formally opened by Lieutenant-Colonel Edwin Charles Cox, Traffic Manager of the Southern Railway, who commented that as the traffic manager of what was then the largest electric rail service in the world, he was now opening what was probably the smallest. Initially, the tunnel was decorated with illuminated scenes depicting Switzerland, Canada, the Netherlands, Japan and Egypt. The railway proved very popular, and over the Bank Holiday weekend carried 20,000 passengers.Harding, p. 17 As it relied on the tourist trade for business, it closed at the end of September. Throughout the 1937, 1938, and 1939 seasons the railway operated between Whitsun and the end of September each year, closing for the autumn and winter.Harding, p. 18 The railway never had a timetable, and operated according to demand. Whenever one station had a sufficient number of passengers the driver signalled to the other station that he was about to depart, and the trains from both stations would set off simultaneously, passing at the halfway crossing loop. The journey took approximately five minutes. Outside of times of peak demand the full-length trains were generally not used, and the trains used split into their two-car sections. There was no depot: trains were stabled in the lower section of the tunnel. Wartime The Ramsgate air-raid shelter tunnel network, April 1939 In the late 1930s, war between Britain and Germany began to seem likely. Ramsgate's location on both the English Channel and North Sea and its proximity to the Thames Estuary, its large port facilities, and its close proximity to RAF Manston made it a likely target for heavy aerial bombing and as a landing site for any German invasion of Britain. With this in mind the town's borough engineer and surveyor, R. D. Brimmell, devised a scheme in 1938 for a network of tunnels beneath the town, to serve as a vast deep-level air- raid shelter for the town's inhabitants. A semi-circular network of tunnels was dug beneath northern Ramsgate, connecting to the existing railway tunnel. It was opened by the Duke of Kent on 1 June 1939, three months before the outbreak of war, and visited during the war by Winston Churchill. The network was capable of sheltering 60,000 people, although Ramsgate's civilian population at the time was approximately 33,000. Post-war operations The Tunnel Railway reopened for the 1946 season as usual. The illuminated tableaux had been removed during the war but were replaced, but this time they were illuminated by floodlights fitted to the sides of the trains rather than being self illuminated.Harding, p. 19 The line was not included in the 1948 nationalisation of the railways and so remained in the hands of Ramsgate Olympia (later Pleasurama). The tableaux were removed around 1955 due to increasing vandalism,Searle, p. 31 and the station signage changed from World Scenic Railway to Tunnel Railway. Site of the former \\"Merrie England\\" and the Tunnel Railway lower terminus, 2004 Part of the chalk cliff near the lower terminus collapsed in 1957, forcing the railway's closure while a strengthening concrete wall was built. The new wall reduced the lower terminus to a single length of track. The second track at Hereson Road was closed at the same time, and removed to build a short siding near the bottom of the tunnel for stabling the trains. The wooden station platforms were replaced by modern concrete structures. At 2:15 pm on 1 July 1965, one of the two-car yellow trains lost control while approaching the lower terminus and ran off the end of the rails before smashing into a building. The driver and several passengers were injured. The station was repaired and services were resumed, but Pleasurama closed the line on 26 September 1965.Mitchell and Smith, ¬ß 114 After the closure After closure the tunnel was sealed, although it remained structurally intact inside.Harding, p. 29 The site of the lower terminus was cleared and became an empty site surrounded by a construction hoarding. There was a small roundabout directly outside the south portal of the tunnel. Hereson Road station became used-car dealership. Four of the railway's carriages were sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the other three were given to the Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Most of the rails and sleepers were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.Harding, p. 30 Following three years of renovation, the lower section of the tunnel was reopened to the public in 2014 as part of the Ramsgate Tunnels tourist attraction. The tunnels were formally reopened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent in a ceremony on 27 May 2014.

Construction and service history Suwanee was built as the German cargo ship SS Mark in 1913 at Vegesack, Germany, by Bremer-Vulkan Works for the North German Lloyd Line. She was the fifth freighter of the Rheinland-Class built for the Australian Freight Line via the Cape. When World War I began in August 1914, Mark was in Japan and left Kobe with 4,000 t of coal for the Squadron of Admiral Spee. Supplying the ships of the Imperial Navy at Pagan Island, she at last served for some days the auxiliary cruisers SMS Prinz Eitel Friedrich and Cormoran. On 7 October 1914 she took refuge at Manila on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, then a neutral territory of the United States, to avoid capture or destruction by Allied naval forces. She was still there when the United States entered the war on the side of the Allies in April 1917. The United States Government seized her and placed her under the control of the United States Shipping Board. Renamed SS Suwanee, she served as an American civilian cargo ship through the end of World War I on 11 November 1918 and into early 1919. USS Suwanee arrives in the southern United States, possibly at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1919 with her deck crowded with servicemen returning from Europe after World War I.

The difference may arise from confusion over whether she was commissioned on the day of her acquisition or after her conversion from a cargo ship to a troop transport, which presumably took until later in April or sometime in May. as USS Suwanee with Lieutenant Commander John A.

Pholidosauridae is an extinct family of aquatic neosuchian mesoeucrocodylian crocodylomorphs. Fossils have been found in Europe (Denmark, England, France, Germany, Spain and Sweden), Africa (Algeria, Niger, Mali, Morocco and Tunisia), North America (Canada and the United States) and South America (Brazil and Uruguay). The pholidosaurids first appeared in the fossil record during the Bathonian stage of the Middle Jurassic. Jouve & Jalil (2020) described postcranial material of a pholidosaurid from the Paleocene (Danian) of Ouled Abdoun Basin (Morocco), representing the most recent record of the family. The authors also reinterpreted putative Maastrichtian dyrosaurid Sabinosuchus as a pholidosaurid, and argued that at least two independent pholidosaurid lineages reached the Maastrichtian, among which one survived the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. Before the publication of this study it was thought that the family became extinct during the Late Turonian stage of the Late Cretaceous. Sarcosuchus is one of the best known pholidosaurs. It is believed to have attained lengths of up to and weighed up to . One genus, Suchosaurus, once thought to be a pholidosaur,Carroll, R.L. 1988. Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution.

(incertae sedis within Baryonychinae; possibly a junior synonym of Baryonyx). The Cenomanian Terminonaris was the Pholidosaurid species that appeared to be the most common during the Late Cretaceous. Phylogeny Pholidosauridae is usually considered to be most closely related to the Dyrosauridae. However, the relationship between these families is not fully understood. Pholidosauridae might be monophyletic, paraphyletic or even a polyphyletic in relation to Dyrosauridae. For example, Fortier, Perea & Schultz (2011) found the family to be monophyletic, and include to main lineages: the Elosuchus‚ÄìMeridiosaurus lineage and the Pholidosaurus lineage. The cladogram below shows their phylogenetic analysis, which is based on an expanded version of Pol and Gasparini (2009) analysis. de Andrade et al. (2011) recovered a paraphyletic traditional Pholidosauridae. In their analysis the \\"Elosuchus lineage\\" was found to be basal to the \\"Pholidosaurus lineage\\"+Dyrosauridae. They used the name Elosuchidae for the Elosuchus lineage and restricted Pholidosauridae to its type genus. The following cladogram simplified after their analysis.

The locality of Alice Arm and the Nisga'a community of Gits'oohl (formerly Gitzault Indian Reserve No. 24) are in the immediate vicinity. \\"Kitsault\\" is an adaptation of Gits'oohl, which means \\"a ways in behind\\". History Mining came to the remote valley with the Dolly Varden mine in 1918. Much of the area had been explored for minerals as Anyox and Stewart had mining booms. Alfred Taylor, of Taylor Way fame at Park Royal Shopping Centre, West Vancouver, started the mine with the help of Chicago money. Bunkhouses, stores and a railway were built to access the rich silver ore. The mine operated for only three years until it was held up in litigation. Taylor eventually won the mine and he went on to build the Lions Gate Bridge. The later town of Kitsault was established in 1979 as the home community to a molybdenum mine run by the Phelps Dodge corporation of the United States. The community was designed for 1,200 residents and included a shopping mall, restaurant, swimming pool and bowling alley. In 1982, however, prices for molybdenum crashed and the entire community was evacuated after just 18 months of residence. In 2004, the ghost town was bought by Indian- American businessman Krishnan Suthanthiran for $5.7 million; he has spent $2 million maintaining the town. In the end, he would have spent over $20 million more to fully update the town. He has also since closed the town to the public. In an effort to revitalize the ghost town, Kitsault has been proposed as a location for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal site for the export of natural gas from northwestern British Columbia. LNG pipeline routing to Kitsault has been proposed.

Personal life Cagle was raised in Corpus Christi, Texas and developed a strong interest in Japanese pop-culture, including both older and more modern anime and video games. In 2013, Cagle graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design and became an English teacher at an elementary school in Kurihara, Japan. WorksKiwi Blitz= In 2009, Cagle started the action/comedy webcomic Kiwi Blitz. Its plot follows a couple of teenagers attempting to fight crime in the pseudo-near future. Kiwi Blitz draws many of its influences from anime, featuring Americanized Japanese mecha designs. Brian Cronin of Comic Book Resources described the set-up of Kiwi Blitz as a \\"strong concept\\" that should be able to sustain itself for a long time. Praising the \\"interesting\\" cast, Cronin noted that Cagle is willing to \\"mix things up\\" so that story doesn't become stale. Lauren Davis of io9 listed Kiwi Blitz among her top ten superhero webcomics. =Let's Speak English= In November 2013, Cagle began illustrating her experiences of being an English teacher in Japan in the form of slice-of-life snippets. The webcomic, titled Let's Speak English, shows Cagle dealing with subjects such as Japanese pop- culture, toilets, thin walls, and the language barrier. =Sleepless Domain= Cagle started the webcomic Sleepless Domain in 2015. The story, set in a city that is invaded by malicious monsters on a nightly basis, features a group of magical girls and their interpersonal issues. Kotaku Australia described Sleepless Domain as a tragic story about the \\"loss of fellowship\\". Hachette began publishing a French-language physical release of the comic in 2018.

Maesllwch Castle The murder Morgan was working in the kitchens in the early hours of a Sunday in September 1804 when she became unwell. She later went to her room in the servant's quarters of the castle. Early that evening the cook went to her room and accused Morgan of having given birth to a baby, which at first she strongly denied. Later, according to the evidence given by the cook, Morgan \\"owned that she had delivered herself of a child which was in the underbed cut open, amongst the feathers with the head nearly divided from the body, and the severely damaged intestinal system removed and placed underneath the child.\\" Inquest and trial The inquest on the baby was held at Glasbury two days later, and the Coroner's Jury found that: Morgan was too ill to travel to Presteigne, where the Assizes were held, until 6 October. The trial eventually began in April 1805 before Mr Justice Hardinge, concluding on 11 April, when the jury found her guilty of murdering her child. Death On 13 April Morgan was hanged, and was buried in what was then unconsecrated ground near the church later that same afternoon. Her public execution attracted large crowds, who watched as she was taken by cart from the gaol to the execution at Gallows Lane. She was subsequently commemorated by two gravestones in the churchyard at Presteigne. Myths and controversies For some time after the execution, it was claimed the father of the murdered child was Walter Wilkins the Younger, the son of the Member of Parliament and High Sheriff for the county and the \\"young squire\\" of Maesllwch Castle. Wilkins was a member of the grand jury which found Morgan had a case to answer. Although this theory is broadly discredited today, it has been key in cementing the popular characterisation of Mary Morgan as the helpless victim of an unscrupulous aristocrat. The father is now generally agreed to have been one of her fellow servants at the castle. Revisionism Since her execution, there has been a concerted effort to redeem Morgan's reputation. Her case became a causes c√©l√®bre for feminists who have presented her trial as a miscarriage of justice and suggested the Judge and jury were misogynistic, although it has never been disputed that the murder happened and there is no reason to believe the verdict or punishment could have been different.

Seyoum Mengesha KBE (Amharic: ·à•·ã©·àù ·àò·äï·åà·àª ; 21 June 1887 - 15 December 1960) was an army commander and a member of the royal family of the Ethiopian Empire. Birth - 1935 Le'ul Ras Seyoum Mengesha was born on 24 June 1886 (1879 in the Ethiopian calendar) in the town of Agawmedir (Zimbriee), in the province of Gojjam to his mother Woizero Kafay, daughter of Ras Wale Betul Abba Tattan, Viceroy of Tigray. His father was Ras Mangasha Yohannes, the son of Emperor Yohannes IV of Ethiopia, from the royal house of Tigray. It is known that in his teenage years (1902-1910), Le'ul Ras Seyoum moved with his family from Gojjam to Tigray. (GebreSellasie 2000). His father, Ras Mangasha Yohannes was the \\"natural\\" son and heir of Emperor Yohannes IV. Because of his descent, Le'ul Ras Seyoum Mangasha was a rival to Emperor Menelik II, who had risen from ruling Shewa Province to become the Emperor upon Yohannes' death.Mockler, Haile Sellassie's War, p. 396 Le'ul Ras Seyoum wed Woizero Tewabech. Tewabech was the daughter of Negus Mikael of Wollo and the sister of Lij Iyasu. Mikael was later honoured with the title of Negus and Iyasu was the uncrowned Emperor of Ethiopia. Ras Seyoum fathered several children from various wives. With his first wife, Woizero Tewabech he had Leult Wolete Israel Seyum who herself married the Crown Prince, Asfaw Wossen. By a previous marriage he had Woizero- Hoy Kebbedech Seyum. By a subsequent marriage he had Leul Mangasha Seyum. In the period 1928-1929 following a long and romantic courtship with Princess Atsede Asfaw Darge from the royal house of Shoa, the couple married and remained devoted until Le'ul Ras Seyoum's death during the coup of 1960. From 1910 to 1935, Le'ul Ras Seyoum Mengesha was the Shum of western Tigray Province. Traditionally the governors of the provinces commanded the provincial Sefari in battle. In the spring of 1924, LeulRas Seyoum Mengesha, Ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam Province, Ras Mulugeta Yeggazu of Illubabor Province, Ras Makonnen Endelkachew, and Blattengeta Heruy Welde Sellase accompanied Ras Tafari Makonnen of Shewa Province on his European tour. Tafari Makonnen was the Crown Prince and Enderase of Ethiopia and was not yet crowned as Emperor Haile Selassie I. The group of Ethiopian royalty visited Jerusalem, Cairo, Alexandria, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, London, Geneva, and Athens. With them they took six lions which were presented to various zoos and dignitaries.Mockler, Haile Sellassie's War, p. 3 In the same year, Seyum Mangasha was awarded the Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). Commander of the Army of Tigre From October 1935 to February 1936, as Ras during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Le'ul Ras Seyoum Mengesha commanded the Army of Tigre. When General Emilio De Bono initially invaded Ethiopia, he was ordered to stay a day's march away from the advancing Italians. Le'ul Ras Seyoum and forces under his command played significant roles in the Ethiopian Christmas Offensive, the First Battle of Tembien, and the Second Battle of Tembien. For seven long months, Le'ul Ras Seyoum and his army from Tigray were the only force preventing the Italians from invading Ethiopia from Eritrea, and it was not until 1936 when the fighting moved to Maitcho that the emperor sent reinforcements to assist Le'ul Ras Seyoum and his men. The subsequent failure of the Ethiopian forces to prevent the Italians from invading, resulted in Le'ul Ras Seyoum and a small contingent of Ethiopian nobility being taken to Italy as prisoners of war. Le'ul Ras Seyoum, his wife Princess Atsede Asfaw and youngest child, son Dejasmatch Mengesha Seyoum were accompanied by close family members during their two-year captivity as Prisoners of War. Their Italian captors accorded the family decent treatment and it was during this time that Le'ul Ras Seyoum and the Duke of Aosta developed a friendship that would later aid the return of Le'ul Ras Seyoum and his family to Ethiopia upon the appointment of the Duke as Viceroy to Ethiopia. Furthermore, his friendship with the Viceroy enabled Le'ul Ras Seyoum to play an influential role in securing the release of 3,000 Ethiopian POWs being held in Italian Somaliland. In the period leading to the Italian withdrawal from Ethiopia, when Britain had committed forces to assist Ethiopia to liberate herself from Italian occupation, Le'ul Ras Seyoum led an army of 70,000 from Tigray in the fight to free the northern provinces from Italian forces. In 1940, following the complete liberation of Ethiopia from Italian occupation, he returned to the Capital Addis Abeba where he was formally re-appointed 'Teklay Gejee of Tigray' (Governor of Tigray Province), and remained in Addis Abeba until 1941 when he was given leave to return to Tigray until the 'Woyane Rebellion' which resulted in his return to the capital, Addis Abeba where he resided under a form of 'house arrest'. Italian occupation of Ethiopia. He spent much of his time under \\"house arrest\\" in Addis Ababa. Tigray Province. Emperor Haile Selassie held Ras Seyum in very deep regard, and depended on him as a senior advisor. He was a member of the Crown Council from 1945 until his death. Woyane Rebellion In 1943, the \\"Woyane Rebellion\\" broke out in southern and eastern Tigre Province and Ras Seyoum was suspected of supporting the rebels. As a consequence, he was recalled to Addis Ababa and replaced by Fitawrari Kifle Dadi and Dejazmach Fikre Selassie Ketema as well as General Tedla Mekeonen and General Isayas Gebre Selassie as the Commander of the Army in Tigray. In 1947, Le'ul Ras Seoyum Mengesha was made Shum of eastern Tigray as well as western Tigray. This was because of the treason of the son of the late Ras Gugsa Araya Selassie, Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa. In 1935, Haile Selassie Gugsa had defected to the Italians during the early days of the war. The Italians had made much propaganda use out of the fact that Haile Selassie Gugsa was the husband of Leult Zenebework Haile Selassie and therefore Haile Selassie's son- in-law. As a result, Ras Seyoum Mangasha was Shum of all Tigray Province, which he held until 1960.Mockler, Haile Sellassie's War, p. 396 Death In December 1960, the Imperial Guard (Kebur Zabangna) launched a coup d'√©tat and seized power in Ethiopia while the Emperor was on a visit to Brazil. The coup leaders compelled the Crown Prince to read a prepared radio statement. In the statement, he accepted the crown in his father's place and announced a government of reform. However, the regular Army and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church both refused to accept the new government. The leader of the church, Patriarch Abuna Basilios, issued an anathema against all those who cooperated with the coup leaders. The Emperor returned to Ethiopia and the Army stormed the palace where members of the government were being held prisoner by the Imperial Guards. The Guards fled, but not before killing many members of the government and the nobility that had been held prisoner in the Green Salon of the palace. Leul Ras Seyoum was among those who were machine gunned to death, he was 74 years old and was buried in Axum. Aftermath Le'ul Ras Mengesha Seyoum, as son and heir of the late Le'ul Ras Seyoum Mengesha, inherited his father's legacy in representing the Tigrean Royal House of Yohannes IV.

History  While traditional linguistic studies had developed comparative methods (comparative linguistics), chiefly to demonstrate family relations between cognate languages, or to illustrate the historical developments of one or more languages, modern contrastive linguistics intends to show in what ways the two respective languages differ, in order to help in the solution of practical problems. (Sometimes the terms diachronic linguistics and synchronic linguistics are used to refer to these two perspectives.) Contrastive linguistics, since its inception by Robert Lado in the 1950s, has often been linked to aspects of applied linguistics, e.g., to avoid interference errors in foreign-language learning, as advocated by Di Pietro (1971)Di Pietro, R.J. (1971) Language Structures in Contrast, Newbury House. (see also contrastive analysis), to assist interlingual transfer in the process of translating texts from one language into another, as demonstrated by Vinay & Darbelnet (1958)Vinay, J.P. & Darbelnet, J. (1958) Stylistique Compar√©e du Fran√ßais et de l'Anglais, Didier-Harrap. and more recently by Hatim (1997)Hatim, B. (1997) Communication across Cultures. Translation Theory and Contrastive Text Linguistics, University of Exeter Press. (see translation), and to find lexical equivalents in the process of compiling bilingual dictionaries, as illustrated by Heltai (1988)Heltai, P. (1988) \\"Contrastive analysis of terminological systems and bilingual technical dictionaries\\", International Journal of Lexicography Vol. 1(1) pp. 32-40. and Hartmann (1991)Hartmann, R.R.K.

(Vol. III, pp. 2854-2859), De Gruyter. (see bilingual lexicography). Contrastive descriptions can occur at every level of linguistic structure: speech sounds (phonology), written symbols (orthography), word-formation (morphology), word meaning (lexicology), collocation (phraseology), sentence structure (syntax) and complete discourse (textology). Various techniques used in corpus linguistics have been shown to be relevant in intralingual and interlingual contrastive studies, e.g. by 'parallel-text' analysis (Hartmann 1997).Hartmann, R.R.K. (1997) \\"From contrastive textology to parallel text corpora: Theory and applications\\", in Language History and Linguistic Modelling. A Festschrift for Jacek Fisiak ed. by R. Hickey & S. Puppel.

Today it is a small rural settlement. History The significance of Vrana to the medieval Croatian history was closely connected with three religious communities: the Benedictines, the Knights Templar, and the Knights Hospitaller. The arrival of these three orders in Vrana and their cultural and political influence was conditioned by the medieval circumstances in Croatia and by the Roman Pope. Vrana had become one of the most important centers of political life, especially in the period from 1070. After the pope's deputies crowned him as the king of Croatia, King Zvonimir Dmitar in 1076 donated the city of Vrana and Benedictine monastery of St. Gregory, as a sign of loyalty to Pope Gregory VII. Vrana was the first permanent diplomatic headquarters of the pope's deputies in the entire Slavic region. Insignia of Croatian Kingdom were held within Vrana's walls for a long time. Consequently, Coloman of Hungary in 1102 came to the coronation in Biograd, as the nearest royal residence. In the 12th century, the church Priory of Vrana donated this property to Knights Templar. At that time, Vrana was fortified with walls and towers and a moat. There are assumptions that the present ruins of a fortified facility above the village were part of a fortified town with a church. After Knights Templars, Vrana was the property of the Knights Hospitallers from 1312. The Ottoman Empire conquered Vrana in 1527, and it remained under their control for a century, before the Republic of Venice took it in the Candian War briefly in 1647 and Morean War finally. In October 1683, the population of Venetian Dalmatia, principally Uskoks of Ravni kotari, took arms and together with the rayah (lower class) of the Ottoman frontier regions rose up, taking Skradin, Karin, Vrana, Benkovac and Obrovac.

He was the last Governor of the Solomon Islands from 1976 to 1978, prior to their independence. Early life Allan was born in Wellington on 23 October 1921. He was the son of John Calder Allan and Mabel Eastwood. He was educated at the Cambridge Primary School and Hamilton High School. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Canterbury University College in 1943 and then graduated Master of Arts in 1945. He also obtained a Diploma in Anthropology from Magdalene College, Cambridge. During World War II he was a naval officer in Wellington in 1942, transferred to the New Zealand Signals the same year and was in the Army Education Service until 1944 where he held the rank of lance corporal. In 1945 he was posted to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force where he served as a lieutenant until 1946. He married Betty Evans in 1955. They had three sons: Timothy, Johnathan, Christopher. Colonial service Towards the end of the Second World War the British Colonial Service had a vast number of vacancies in its 50 dependent territories around the world. Restoration of basic civilian administration was a priority for the Service, particularly in those countries that had been invaded. Because of the shortage of suitable staff, the Service appointed some colonials, including Allan. =Solomon Islands= The post-war period was a particularly difficult one for the Service, with various independence movements springing up around the globe. In the British Solomon Islands Protectorate where Allan was appointed as Administrative Officer (Cadet) in 1945, the Marching Rule was one such movement. He was appointed as District Officer on Nggela (1945), Western Solomons (1946), Ysabel and Choiseul (1948), and Malaita in 1949. From 1947 to 1948 he was District Commissioner for Western Solomons. He became District Commissioner for Malaita in 1952. From 1953 to 1954 he was Special Lands Commissioner. By 1954 Allan had organised the first Council of Malaita for the local population. This effectively ended the influence of the Marching Rule. Western Pacific High Commission From 1954 to 1955 Allan was attached to the Western Pacific High Commission's Secretariat (Finance and Development). He became Senior Assistant Secretary in 1955. Appointed to the Special Lands Commission from 1956 to 1957, member and Secretary BSIP Agriculture and Industry Loans Board (1956‚Äì1957), Secretary for Protectorate Affairs (1957‚Äì1958), Chairman BSIP Copra Marketing Board (1957‚Äì1958), and UK member of the South Pacific Commission Research Council (1958). In 1957 he wrote a book called Customary Land Tenure in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in which he outlined the native land ownership. =Vanuatu= Allan was Assistant British Resident Commissioner to the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) from 1959 to 1966 and British Resident Commissioner from 1966 to 1973. Allan's residence was on Iririki by Port Vila. =Seychelles= In 1973 Allan was appointed Governor of the Seychelles, a post he held till 1 October 1975 when he was appointed High Commissioner from 1 October 1975 to 28 June 1976, when the Seychelles became an independent republic. =Return to the Solomons= Allan was appointed Governor of the Solomon Islands from 1976 to 1978. His appointment ended when the Solomons gained their independence in 1978.Allan CH (1983). The Transfer of Power: Ministerialization in Island Countries. International Review of Administrative Sciences, Vol. 49, No. 1, 49‚Äì60 (1983) Retirement When he retired the Australian National University and the Universities of Auckland, Otago and New South Wales all invited him as a visiting lecturer or fellow. Allan was awarded the OBE in 1959, the CMG in 1968, and KCMG in 1977. He was also awarded the French Commander l'Ordre National du Merit√©. He died on 5 March 1993 at Howick, Auckland.

The group was made up of over 70 undergraduate and graduate students from six of Cornell University‚Äôs seven colleges including the College of Engineering, the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, the College of Human Ecology, and the Johnson Graduate School of Management. The multi- disciplinary group was organized into several teams, including Electrical Components, Mechanical Components, Structures, Business Administration, Design, and Information Management. These groups utilized a systems engineering approach to design an automobile that would push the limits of efficiency, feature a distinctive and unique aesthetic, and be commercially viable in the market. The goal of the team was to win the competition and to provide the world with a state-of-the-art automobile that would help reduce global non-renewable power consumption and harmful emissions. However, after successfully completing the first stages of the shakedown in May, the vehicle experienced multiple electronics failures during the endurance portion. The team decided to withdraw from the competition for safety reasons, since they did not have the time and resources to fully diagnose the problem. Testing The Test Bed - A 1991 Geo Metro The Cornell 100+ MPG Team tested and evaluated different component technologies and systems in preparation of the final submission to the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize Competition. The team used a 1991 Geo Metro as a test bed to evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of components including drivetrains, battery packs, electrical generators, and regenerative braking schemes. In addition, the team's aerodynamics and design specialists created and tested conceptual design schemes both in computer simulation software and in real-world wind tunnels. The team's plan was to arrive at a final design, which was to take the form of a feasibly marketable vehicle that could be brought to market in the near term. Technology All-electric test drive The team's final submission car was to be a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). This technology would allow the car to act as a pure electric vehicle for a range of 40‚Äì50 miles on a full battery charge. When this battery power runs low, the car would be capable of recharging while in motion, using a small gasoline-powered onboard generator. The vehicle would also be capable of recharging, while stationary, from an outlet connected to the electricity grid. The final entry was a series diesel hybrid, a car that would only use the power from the electric motor for propulsion. The combustion engine, a 1.4L Volkswagen motor, would only be used to generate power and recharge the batteries, which would then give power to the electric motor to drive the car. The vehicle would also feature a very aerodynamic, low drag design. The Cornell 100+ MPG Team was competing in the mainstream class of the competition, which requires that the final submission be a 4-wheel, 4-passenger design. Team Structure The Cornell 100+ MPG Team The Cornell 100+ MPG Team was made up of over 55 students from many different educational backgrounds, including engineering, architecture, design and environmental analysis, and business. This multi-disciplinary group was organized into several teams, including Electrical Components, Mechanical Components, Structures, Design, Information Management, and Business Administration. The team was restructured for the start of Spring Semester 2009 to include an Engineering Resources sub-team. =Electrical Components Team= The function of the Electrical Components Team was to help choose and develop electric motors, batteries, and power electronics, as well as to create logical and efficient interfaces between them and the engine. Its engineers were challenged to balance the car's performance and the passenger comfort with maximum electrical efficiency. In order to optimize the electrical efficiency of the vehicle, the team performed extensive research and development on all of the component technologies related to the car's electrical system. These components and systems included battery packs, motors/controllers, regenerative braking systems, engine control units, as well as eco-feedback schemes (MPG and emissions read-outs). =Mechanical Components Team= The function of the Mechanical Components Team was to develop a light and efficient drive train as well as to simulate the dynamic performance of the vehicle. The team was focusing on getting the most efficiency and performance out of several areas, and split into subgroups to maximize its potential to innovate in the following areas: Engine, Transmission, Brakes, Regeneration, and HVAC. For example, the engine team was looking at a variety of engines on the market and evaluating which can be optimized for use in the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize competition, as well as exactly how they might be modified to make them even more efficient. =Structures Team= The function of the Structures Team was to engineer the external architecture and components of the vehicle, including the frame, body, and suspension. The team also had to ensure that all dimensions were compliant with motor vehicle laws and that the vehicle achieved an adequate crash test rating. The team‚Äôs main challenge was to maximize aerodynamic efficiency while integrating the mechanical and electrical components that the other teams were designing. For the Chassis Team, coordination with the other Cornell 100+ MPG Team engineers was essential as they worked towards selecting the best frame structure and suspension systems for the vehicle. =Design Team= The function of the Design Team was to perform a critical balancing act, weighing exterior style, aerodynamics, and interior space against the restrictions that the vehicle‚Äôs other components might impose. They worked closely with the entire 100+ MPG team, and were responsible for creating conceptual designs of the car that could be tested for safety and aerodynamic properties. They were to select a final concept design, which they would then develop further into a feasibly- marketable vehicle that could be brought to market in the near-term. Other responsibilities included creating and maintaining all visual identities of the team. The Design Team included students from several of Cornell‚Äôs colleges, which brought a diverse skill set to all of their important responsibilities. =Information Management Team= The function of the Information Management Team was to provide the rest of the team with efficient systems of communication as well as to provide a portal for the general public to easily learn about the team's efforts. They accomplished these goals using several web-based, cutting edge systems: a TWiki system, an Eventum system, and a SilverStripe system. The Twiki software provides a central platform for keeping agendas, research, reports, weekly updates, calendars, and other team documents. The Eventum system is used for task-tracking, and enables sub-team leaders to keep track of the tasks assigned to each team member, as well as the status of each of these tasks. Both Eventum and Twiki promote collaboration by maintaining open communications throughout the team organization. The SilverStripe software is a web-based Content Management System (CMS) that is being used to efficiently add and maintain the digital content found on Cornell 100+ MPG's public website. =Business Administration Team= The function of the Business Administration Team was to deal primarily with the sponsorship, publicity, and operational needs of the team. Operational responsibilities included coordinating media relations and involvement in academic on-campus and public events, organizing team lab logistics and events, and recruiting new team members. Pecuniary responsibilities included structuring team budgeting, purchasing, and product acquisition support, establishing new team sponsors, and maintaining relationships with current sponsors. A legacy arm of the sub-team was the Business Plan Team. The Business Plan Team objective was to identify a target market for the final vehicle, intelligently price it, and create a system for producing, distributing, and servicing the vehicle with the goal of bringing to market at least 10,000 units per year. The team was made up of several Johnson Graduate School of Management students who have experience in supply- chain management, consulting, and corporate finance. Sponsorship The support of sponsors allowed Cornell students, both undergraduate and graduate, to get hands-on experience building a car that could change the automotive industry, thus enhancing their educational experience at Cornell. Cornell University provided the team with faculty time, laboratory space, and testing facilities. However, the majority of Cornell 100+ MPG's design and production budget came directly from private and corporate donations. =Current Sponsors=Ultimate-102 Level Sponsors in the Ultimate-102 category contributed at least $25,000. * General Electric * Cornell University College of Engineering * National Instruments * NYSERDA * Changs Ascending Enterprise Co., Ltd.

The church was constructed at a cost of around $20 million on land donated by the Emir of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Due to the laws in Islamic Qatar, the church displays no Christian symbols like crosses, bells, or a steeple on its exterior. The church was dedicated on 14 March 2008, by Cardinal Ivan Dias, prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelisation, in a ceremony attended by Qatari Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Bin Hamad Al- Attiyah; Archbishop Mounged Al Hachem, the ambassador of the Holy See to the Gulf; Bishop Paul Hinder, Apostolic Vicariate of Arabia; Archbishop Giuseppe Andrea, former nuncio of the Holy See to the region; and several Qatari officials.

Wazwan () is a multi- course meal in Kashmiri cuisine, the preparation of which is considered as an art and a point of pride in Kashmiri culture and identity. Almost all the dishes are meat-based using lamb or chicken with few vegetarian dishes. It is popular throughout the Kashmir. Moreover, Wazwan is also served internationally at Kashmiri food festivals and reunions. History Waza preparing Rista In the Kashmiri language, waz means 'cook' or 'cooking' and wan means 'shop'. The ultimate formal banquet in Kashmir is the royal wazwan. Of its thirty-six courses, between fifteen and thirty can be preparations of meat, cooked overnight under the supervision of a master chef called a wouste waze. Guests are seated in groups of four and share the meal out of a large copper plate called the traem. A ritual washing of hands in a portable basin called the Tash-t-naer, which is taken around by attendants. Then the traem arrives, heaped with rice, quartered by two seekh kababs and contains four pieces of methi maaz, (mutton intestines flavored with a spice mixture containing dried fenugreek (methi) leaves), two tabakh maaz (twice-cooked lamb ribs, initially braised with ground spices , then browned in ghee), one safed kokur (chicken with white sauce), one zafran kokur (chicken with saffron sauce), and the first few courses. Yogurt and chutney are served separately in small earthen pots. Up to about 20 items are served thereafter by waza (the junior cook). Seven dishes are a must for these occasions ‚Äî tabakh maaz, rista (meatballs in a red, paprika-saffron-fennel spice gravy colored with dyer's alkanet), rogan josh, daniwal korma (lamb roasted with yoghurt, spices and onion puree, topped with coriander leaves), aab gosh (lamb chunks cooked with a fennel-based spice mixture, cardamom and partially evaporated milk), marchhwangan korma (chicken legs/thighs cooked in a spicy browned-onion sauce) and gushtaba (meatballs cooked in a spicy yoghurt gravy). The main course usually ends with gushtaba. The Gushtaba is a large meatball which signals the end of the main course. After that, desserts are served. In winters, the dessert can be a hot sweet dish and in summers, it is usually something cold.

His service record is sometimes confused with the more famous John Armstrong, Jr., a Pennsylvania officer who became U.S. Secretary of War. Armstrong rejoined the United States Army in 1784 and served during the Northwest Indian War. In 1790, General Josiah Harmar sent him on an exploration mission in the Northwest Territory. Later that year he led a detachment of regular soldiers that accompanied Kentucky militia under Colonel John Hardin in an expedition to attack a Native American village on the Eel River. The Americans were ambushed in the battle; the militia fled and Armstrong barely escaped with his life. He resigned from the Army in March 1793. After the war, he served as treasurer of the Northwest Territory, a judge in Hamilton County, Ohio, and as magistrate in Columbia, Ohio.

He played in the Football League for Barnsley and in the Southern League for Swindon Town. After injury caused a ¬£1000 transfer to Aston Villa to fall through, Silto joined Swindon during the summer of 1909, after being released by Barnsley, who suspected he was injury-prone. Had the transfer gone through he would have been the first British football player to have been sold for more than ¬£1000. He went on to make well over 200 appearances for Swindon over the following eleven years - and without the interruption of the First World War, it would have been far more. A strong- tackling, energetic half-back with incredible stamina, Silto was part of one of the most successful sides in the Town's history, winning two Southern League championship medals, the Dubonnet Cup, and also reaching the FA Cup semi-finals twice. In the 1912 semi-final replay against Barnsley, Swindon were awarded a penalty, and, with regular penalty-taker Billy Tout out through injury, Silto stepped up to take the kick, eager to score against his former club. He was stopped in his tracks by captain Peter Chambers, who told Silto, \\"you don't take penalties, Billy\\", and handed the responsibility to a reluctant Archie Bown. Bown missed the kick, and Barnsley went on to win the tie 1‚Äì0. Such were Silto's performances in the Swindon team, that he was recognised as the understudy to the England half-back Billy Wedlock for many seasons, and though he joined up with the England squad on many occasions, the only appearances he made were on an unofficial tour of South Africa in 1910. After retirement, Silto settled in the Swindon area where the sporting heritage would continue with his son Joe Silto playing and later captaining England at table tennis playing against notable world names including 5 times World Champion Viktor Barna, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest players of all time. Like former Swindon Town teammate Harold Fleming, a street was named 'Silto Court' in the town in recognition of the international sporting achievements by both generations of the family.

The ICMM was established in 1921, in response to concerns over the lack of care provided during World War I. It was created to strengthen cooperation between the health services of the armed forces worldwide.  History  General Doctor Jules Voncken (Belgium), Co-Founder and Secretary General of the International Committee of Military Medicine from 1921 until 1975 In 1920, after issues were raise including lack of care for victims and the need for closer cooperation between armed forces medical services following World War I, Captain William S. Bainbridge, MD (US Navy) and Commander Medical Officer Jules Voncken (Belgium) suggested the creation of an international organisation of the Armed Forces Medical Services at the 28th session of the US Military Medical Officers Association (AMSUS). The Belgian Government supported the practical development of this concept and the first International Congress of Military Medicine and Pharmacy was held in July 1921 in Brussels, Belgium, in presence of King Albert I. It resulted in a permanent Committee of International Congresses of Military Medicine and Pharmacy (ICMPM) being officially founded on 21 July 1921 during the Congress. The founding countries were Belgium, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. First International Assembly of Medical Services of the Armies, Navies and Air Forces, July 1921, Belgium Since its founding, ICMPM has always gathered military Health Services from all political blocs, in uniform, including during the Cold War. On 21 May 1952, an agreement of cooperation was signed with the World Health Organization (WHO) which recognised the committee as an \\"international body specialised in medico-military matters\\". On 28 April 1990, the Committee changed its name and became the International Committee of Military Medicine (ICMM). New ICMM Statutes, revised in line with modern-day policies, were voted in at the General Assembly held in Beijing, China, in 1996. ICMM signed a memorandum of understanding with World Health Organization in 2004 and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in 2006.  Objectives of ICMM  The main objective of the ICMM is to ensure that our medical services personnel have the means to work together, using similar practices, in operations involving international cooperation. This is a long-term goal and the ICMM can work towards it in a number of ways: by encouraging activities at which scientific and technical experience is shared, by developing contacts with the scientific community, and by promoting regional events. This will enable the pooling of resources and work experience of military medicine, both in the theatre of operations and in a support role in the case of crisis situations. Other ICMM objectives include: * Maintain and strengthen relations between medical services of member states * Promote scientific military medical activities * Provide best practices and standards which member states can aim for * Help develop medical and military medical recommendations for humanitarian operations (these could range from Armed Forces humanitarian interventions to peacekeeping operations) * facilitate relations between armed forces medical services of ICMM member states and international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the International Military Sports Council (IMSC), the World Veterinary Association (WVA), the World Medical Association (WMA) and the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). The above objectives are intended to improve the state of military medicine through providing means of screening personnel, providing access to medicine within military units, improving surgery in the theatre of operations, improving access to emergency medicine, improving disaster response, providing medical logistics training, and improving public health, dentistry, pharmacy, and veterinary services.  Activities  In addition to the annual World Congress of the International Committee of Military Medicine, the ICMM organises regional congresses, including the Pan- Asia Pacific, Pan-American, Pan-African, Pan-European, Maghreb and Pan-Arab Regional working groups. The ICMM also publishes the quarterly International Review of the Armed Forces Medical Services, providing a material link between medical services and member states.  Study of Training and Coaching  In the field of training and coaching, the ICMM objectives are: * Enabling exchange of ideas on training methods used in the world * Establishing non- restrictive guidelines * Establishing a database of existing training * Organizing international courses  Assessment of disaster situations  The ICMM promotes discussions on medical services activity during disasters.  Cooperation with international organizations  The ICMM has signed agreements with WHO, ICRC, OIE, UNAIDS, CISM, WVA, WMA and FIP. These agreements provide for cooperation with medical services of member states in order to detect and respond to major epidemics posing a global threat to public health. WHO, ICRC, OIE, UNAIDS, CISM, WVA, WMA and FIP contact each government individually.  Study of International Humanitarian Law evolution  A Course of Law of Armed Conflicts is organized each year with the support of Switzerland. This course is actually decentralized in different regions of the world.  Structure and Working of ICMM  The ICMM is a politically neutral international intergovernmental organization. The ICMM is made up of 117 member states and 5 observer States, all of which are either members of the United Nations (UN), have the status of official observers with in the UN, or are recognised as members of WHO. Each member state is represented by an official delegate who is appointed by the government of his country. Each member state brings a request issued from the Ministry of Defense, Foreign Affairs, or other high state authority, requesting to be a member of ICMM. This request is addressed to the Secretary General and approved during a session of the General Assembly of the Member States during the World Congress every two years. Each Member State pays a subscription determined by its GDP, debt level, and population. This subscription gives the state the right to vote in the General Assembly and to organize activities acknowledged by the ICMM. A moral duty of active participation follows the membership of member states. The General Assembly's recommendations are always non-restrictive and strictly observe each member state's sovereignty principle. Only the political power of each member state can change ICMM recommendations into rules applicable to its own Armed Forces. In accordance with ICMM's statutes and history, Belgium is the seat of the Secretary General, the executive branch of ICMM. The stability of the headquarters is maintained for continuity. All participants are volunteer except a few paid executive secretaries. The Secretary-General is elected by the General Assembly for a 4-years renewable mandate. He is at the head of the ICMM executive branch. The current Secretary-General is Major General (retired) Roger Van Hoof, assisted by his Deputy Secretary-General, Major General Pierre Neirincx and his assistants. They represent the political body of the Secretariat General. The Secretary General and his Deputy are Belgians, according with the statutes of ICMM. The Secretary General executes the decisions of the General Assembly. The General Assembly holds the World Congresses every two years, led by the Chairman of the ICMM, chosen by the member state selected to organise that World Congress. He is at the head of the ICMM legislative branch by supervising the General Assembly's work during the World Congress in his country. His mandate, not renewable, runs for the duration between two General Assemblies. The Secretary General reports his executive activities to the Chairman. All scientific matters are controlled by the Scientific Council, directed by the Chairman of the Scientific Council, Major General Humbert Boisseau, MD. He is elected by the General Assembly for a 4-year renewable mandate. He is assisted by the Deputy Chairman of the Scientific Council, Brigadier General Jean-Jacques Lataillade, MD, also elected by the General Assembly for a 4-year renewable mandate.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 5, 2009. Moe falls in love with a woman named Maya, whom he met over the Internet. When Moe meets her in person, she turns out to be a little person. They remain in love, but his tactless attitude to her size eventually drives her away. Meanwhile, in an attempt to spend more time with Maggie, Homer inadvertently drops her off at a playground full of bullies. Plot Homer attempts to spend more time with Maggie and ends up bringing her to Moe's Tavern. Moe is cleaning up the bar for a date, and finds out he actually has a window, which was previously obscured by layers of grime. Outside the window is a playground, which Homer sees as an opportunity for watching Maggie while spending time at Moe's. Homer sends Maggie to play with the other babies outside, but they turn out to be ruthless bullies. Marge notices Maggie is uncomfortable when she returns home one day, and becomes worried that Homer is neglecting her. After watching a commercial about a surveillance camera fixed in the eye of a teddy bear, Marge purchases a spy camera which she attaches to Maggie's hair band and discovers that Maggie is bullied by a group of gangster babies. At first, Marge is surprised to see Maggie being tormented by the babies, but sees Homer, after he discovered the truth about the other babies from the playground, rush to Maggie's rescue and be beaten up by Kearney's son. Maggie jumps to Homer's rescue and Homer says that he loves both her and Marge. Moved to tears, Marge tells Homer he is a wonderful father. Meanwhile, Moe's date, whom he met over the Internet, turns out to be a little person named Maya. Moe still loves her, but is worried about what his friends will think. Moe decides to take Maya on a double date with Marge and Homer, neither of whom seem to care that she is small. Homer, seeing Maya's intelligence and sensitivity, suggests Moe marry her. Moe proposes but cannot resist making jokes about Maya's height. Insulted, she rejects him. Crushed by grief, Moe consults the advice of Lenny and Carl, who advise him to do something risky to win Maya back. Moe decides to have surgery to become shorter, and Dr. Nick Riviera agrees to conduct the surgery. Maya stops Moe just before the surgery, as she wants someone who sees her as \\"beautiful\\" not \\"short\\", and who does not need to cut himself down to her size in order to love her. Moe, intent on having the surgery, does not listen to Maya, and she leaves him for good. Homer consoles a dejected Moe, stating that even though things did not go well with Maya, Moe actually found love with a woman who loved him back and that if he was successful once, he will be successful again. Moe brightens up and wonders how a small woman like Maya could make him feel so big. Cultural references The title is a parody of the children's rhyme, \\"Eeny Meeny Miny Moe\\". Kearney's son banging the three bottles together on his fingers is reference to the 1979 film The Warriors. A play on a theme from one of Philip Glass's scores is heard during the commercial about \\"leaving your kids unguarded\\". Moe references people that live in trees, particularly Tarzan and The Berenstain Bears. Also, upon learning that Maya finds him attractive, Moe joyfully utters the nonsense phrase \\"Oh, frabjulous day, calloo callay!\\" which is a reference to a similar line in the Lewis Carroll poem \\"Jabberwocky\\". When Moe turns on the television in Maya's house, it is showing a scene from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory featuring the Oompa Loompas singing. Maya tells Moe that the photo of herself she shared with Moe over the internet was taken at Legoland. When Moe meets Maya in person he tears down an advertisement for dwarf tossing and throws out a copy of Little Women. Shortly afterwards, he asks Maya \\"So, have you always been this size, or is this, like, a Benjamin Button deal?\\". Moe states that he is a snake handler, which was previously mentioned in the 1992 episode \\"Homer the Heretic\\". Reception Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Robert Canning, a reviewer of IGN.com gave the episode a 7.6/10 and said when Homer consoled Moe about getting broken up with, it was \\"a sweet way to end this enjoyable episode\\". Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: \\"Spending too much time away from the family has always been tricky for The Simpsons. Letting minor characters shine can be fun, but let‚Äôs face it: people tune in to watch the Simpsons, not the Szyslaks, or the Flanderses, or the Leonard- Carlsons. Then again, spending too much time with the family can be exhausting. This week, The Simpsons hit a nice middle ground, spending most of the episode on Moe‚Äôs short-lived relationship but backing it up with a Homer- Maggie-Marge B-plot. Neither story soared to great heights, but 'Eeny Teeny Maya Moe' was a solid entry in a (thus far) solid season.\\" Hank Azaria was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role as Moe Szyslak in this episode, but lost to fellow Simpsons cast member Dan Castellaneta for \\"Father Knows Worst\\". John Frink was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the Animation category in 2010 for writing the episode. The Simpsons was the only show to be nominated in the category, with the other nominated episodes being \\"The Burns and the Bees\\", \\"Take My Life, Please\\", \\"Gone Maggie Gone\\" and \\"Wedding for Disaster\\". The last one was the winner.

In a ghost-written memoir, A Narrative of Four Voyages, which describes his sea-going life between 1823 and 1832, Morrell included numerous claims of discovery and achievement, many of which have been disputed by geographers and historians, and in some cases have been proved false. He ended his career as a fugitive, having wrecked his ship and misappropriated parts of the salvaged cargo. Morrell had an eventful early career, running away to sea at the age of 17 and being twice captured and imprisoned by the British during the War of 1812. He subsequently sailed before the mast for several years before being appointed as chief mate, and later as captain, of the New York sealer Wasp. In 1823 he took Wasp for an extended voyage into subantarctic waters, and on his return made unsubstantiated claims to have travelled beyond 70 ¬∞S and to have sighted new coastlines in the area now known as the Weddell Sea. His subsequent voyages mainly centered on the Pacific, where he attempted to develop trading relations with the indigenous populations. Although Morrell wrote of the enormous potential wealth to be obtained from the Pacific trade, his endeavours were, in the main, commercially unprofitable. Despite his reputation among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain that not all his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name, there is evidence that he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which led to the development of a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America. Early life and career Map of the South Shetland Islands, scene of Morrell's first Antarctic adventures Morrell was born at Rye, in Westchester County, New York, on July 5, 1795. He grew up in Stonington, Connecticut, where his father, also named Benjamin, was employed as a shipbuilder. Morrell, after minimal schooling, ran away to sea at the age of 17 \\"without taking leave of any member of my family, or intimating my purpose to a single soul\\".Morrell, Introduction, pp. ix‚Äìxi During the War of 1812, which broke out while he was at sea, he was twice captured by the British; on his first voyage his ship, carrying a cargo of flour, was intercepted off St John's, Newfoundland, and Morrell was detained for eight months. His second voyage landed him in Dartmoor prison, England, for two years.H. R. Mill, p. 104 After his release Morrell continued his seafaring career, sailing before the mast as an ordinary seaman since his lack of education prevented him advancing to officer rank. A sympathetic captain, Josiah Macy, taught him what he needed to know to qualify as an officer,American National Biography (Vol. 15), p. 879 and in 1821 he was appointed chief mate on the sealer Wasp, under Captain Robert Johnson. Wasp was bound for the South Shetland Islands, which had been discovered three years earlier by the British Captain William Smith.H. R. Mill, pp. 94‚Äì95 Morrell, who had evidently heard stories of these islands, was keen to go there. On the ensuing voyage he was involved in a series of \\"remarkable adventures\\" which included a narrow escape from drowning, then being lost at sea in a small boat during a gale that swept him from the ship, and leading efforts to extricate Wasp when she became trapped in the ice.H. R. Mill, p. 105 On the day following his return to New York, Morrell was appointed captain of Wasp, while Johnson took over the schooner Henry. The two ships were jointly commissioned to return to the South Seas for sealing, trading and exploration, and \\"to ascertain the practicality, under favourable circumstances, of penetrating to the South Pole.\\"Morrell, p. 30 Four voyagesFirst voyage: South Seas and Pacific Ocean= Wasp and Henry sailed from New York on June 21, 1822, and remained together as far as the Falkland Islands. They then separated, Wasp travelling east in search of sealing grounds. Morrell's account of the next few months of the voyage, in Antarctic and subantarctic waters, is controversial. His claims of distances, latitudes and discoveries have been challenged as inaccurate or impossible, giving substance to his reputation among his contemporaries for untruth, and leading to much criticism by later writers.Gould, p. 255 and p. 258 Antarctic waters Bouvet Island (1898 photograph) Morrell's journal indicates that Wasp reached South Georgia on November 20, and then sailed eastwards towards the isolated Bouvet Island, which lies approximately midway between Southern Africa and the Antarctic continent and is known as the world's remotest island. It had been discovered in 1739 by the French navigator Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier,Mills, pp. 434‚Äì35 but his plotting of its position was inaccurate;H. R. Mill, p. 47 Captain James Cook, in 1772, had been unable to find it and had assumed its nonexistence. It had not been seen again until 1808, when the British sealing captains James Lindsay and Thomas Hopper reached it and recorded its correct position, though they were unable to land.McGonigal, p. 135 Morrell, by his own account, found the island without difficulty‚Äîwith \\"improbable ease\\", in the words of historian William Mills‚Äî before landing and hunting seals there. In his subsequent lengthy description, Morrell does not mention the island's most obvious physical feature, its permanent ice cover.H. R. Mill, pp. 106‚Äì107 This has caused some commentators to doubt whether he actually visited the island. Sketch of Wasp's voyage track, November 20, 1822 to February 28, 1823, based on Morrell's claimed positions. Much of the return journey (continuous line) is within the Antarctic coastline. After leaving Bouvet Island, Wasp continued eastward, reaching the Kerguelen Islands on December 31, 1822, where she remained for 11 days. The voyage then evidently continued to the south and east until February 1, 1823, when Morrell records his position as 65¬∞52'S, 118¬∞27'E.Morrell, pp. 65‚Äì68 Here, Morrell says he took advantage of an eleven- knot breeze and turned the ship, to begin a passage westward. Apart from one undated position at 69¬∞11'S, 48¬∞15'E, Morrell's journal is silent until February 23, when he records crossing the Greenwich (0¬∞) meridian. Historians have doubted whether such a long passage from 118¬∞E, about , could have been made so quickly in ice-strewn waters and against the prevailing winds.H. R. Mill, pp. 107‚Äì08 Although some writers, including former Royal Navy navigator Rupert Gould, have argued that Morrell's claims as to speed and distance are plausible,Gould, pp. 260‚Äì62 Morrell's undated interim latitude was later shown to be well inside the Antarctic mainland territory of Enderby Land. Gould, writing in 1928 before the continental boundaries of this sector of Antarctica were known, based his support for Morrell on the premise that Enderby Land was an island with a sea channel south of it.See Gould, p. 257 and pp. 261‚Äì62. He added: \\"If at some future date Enderby Land is found to form part of the Antarctic continent, Morrell's most inveterate champions will, perforce, have to throw up the sponge.\\"Gould, p. 281 According to Morrell, Wasp reached the South Sandwich Islands on February 28. His presence there is corroborated by his descriptions of the harbour on Thule Island, confirmed by the early 20th century expeditions.Gould, p. 263 In the next phase of the voyage Morrell records that he took Wasp southwards and, the sea being remarkably clear of ice, reached a latitude of 70¬∞14'S before turning north on March 14 as fuel for the ship's stoves was running out. This journey, if Morrell's account is true, made him the first American sea-captain to penetrate the Antarctic Circle. He believed, he says, that but for this deficiency he could have \\"made a glorious advance directly to the South Pole, or to 85¬∞ without the least doubt\\". Some credence to his claimed southern latitude is provided by James Weddell's voyage on a similar track, a month earlier, which reached 74¬∞15'S before retreating. The words used by Weddell to express his belief that the South Pole lay in open water are replicated by Morrell, whose account was written nine years after the event. Thus it is suggested by geographer Paul Simpson-Housley that Morrell may have plagiarised Weddell's experiences,Simpson-Housley, pp. 57‚Äì59 since Weddell's account had been published in 1827. New South Greenland Morrell's account describes how on the day after turning north from his southernmost point, a large tract of land was sighted in the region of 67¬∞52'N, 44¬∞11'W. Morrell refers to this land as \\"New South Greenland\\",Morrell, pp. 69‚Äì70 and records that during the next few days Wasp explored more than of coast. Morrell provided vivid descriptions of the land's features, with observations of its abundant wildlife. No such land exists; other appearances of land at or near this bearing, reported during the 1842 expedition of Sir James Clark Ross, have likewise proved imaginary.Gould, pp. 272‚Äì74 In 1917 the Scottish explorer William Speirs Bruce wrote that the existence of land in this area \\"should not be rejected until absolutely disproved.\\"Bruce, in Scottish Geographical Magazine, June 1917, quoted in Gould, pp. 270‚Äì71 By this time both Wilhelm Filchner and Ernest Shackleton, in their respective ice-bound ships, had drifted close to the plotted positions of New South Greenland and reported no sign of it.Shackleton. pp. 60‚Äì61 It has been suggested that what Morrell saw was actually the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, some further west from his sighting.H. R. Mill, pp.109‚Äì10 This would require a navigational error of at least 10¬∞, and a complete revision of Morrell's timeline after leaving the South Sandwich Islands.Gould, pp. 276‚Äì82 Assuming that Morrell did not invent the experience, a possible explanation is that he witnessed a superior mirage. Pacific and home On March 19 Morrell \\"bade farewell to the cheerless shores of New South Greenland\\", and sailed away from the Antarctic never to return. The remaining stages of the voyage are uncontroversial, involving a year-long cruise in the Pacific Ocean. This took Wasp to the Gal√°pagos Islands and also to the island of M√°s a Tierra where, a century earlier, the Scottish seaman Alexander Selkirk had been marooned, providing the inspiration for the Robinson Crusoe story. Wasp returned to New York in May 1824. There, he found that his wife whom he had married in 1819, not named in any accounts of Morrell's life or career, and his two small children, likewise unnamed, had all died. He quickly married his 15-year-old cousin, Abigail Jane Wood (\\"Abby\\"). = Second voyage: North and South Pacific = For his second voyage Morrell took charge of a new ship, Tartar, which sailed from New York on July 19, 1824 for the Pacific Ocean. In the next two years Tartar first explored the American coastline from the Straits of Magellan to Cape Blanco (now in Oregon).Morrell, pp. 203‚Äì15 He then sailed westward to the islands of Hawaii, known at that time as the Sandwich Islands, where Captain James Cook had met his death nearly 40 years earlier. Thereafter Tartar returned to the American coast and tracked slowly southwards back to the Straits of Magellan.Morrell, pp. 246‚Äì48 Fernandina Island in the Gal√°pagos, where Morrell witnessed a spectacular volcanic eruption on February 14, 1825 Among the events witnessed and recorded in Morrell's journal were the siege of Callao, the main port of Peru, by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's liberators,Rodriguez, p. 232Morrell, pp. 177‚Äì78 and a spectacular volcanic eruption on Fernandina Island in the Gal√°pagos archipelago, which Tartar visited during February 1825. Fernandina, then known as Narborough Island, exploded on February 14. In Morrell's words \\"The heavens appeared to be one blaze of fire, intermingling with millions of falling stars and meteors; while the flames shot upward from the peak of Narborough to the height of at least two thousand feet.\\"Kricher, p. 57 Morrell reports that the air temperature reached 123 ¬∞F (51 ¬∞C), and as Tartar approached the river of lava flowing into the sea, the water temperature rose to 150 ¬∞F (66 ¬∞C). Some of the crew collapsed in the heat. Morrell also records how a hunting trip ashore in California led to a skirmish with the locals which turned into a full-scale battle ending, he says, with seventeen natives dead and seven of Tartar's men wounded. Morrell claims that he was among the casualties, with an arrow in his thigh. Of a visit to San Francisco Morrell writes: \\"The inhabitants are principally Mexicans and Spaniards who are very indolent and consequently very filthy.\\" After revisiting the Galapagos Islands and gathering a harvest of fur seal and terrapin,Morrell uses the word \\"terrapin\\", presumably referring to the Galapagos tortoise. The terms were used interchangeably in Morrell's day; for example see Charles Darwin in , p. 312 Tartar began a slow journey home on October 13, 1825. As they left the Pacific Morrell claimed to have personally inspected and identified every danger existing along the American Pacific coast.Morrell, p. 231 Tartar finally reached New York Harbour on May 8, 1826 with a main cargo of 6,000 fur seals. This haul did not please Morrell's employers, who had evidently expected rather more. \\"The reception I met from my owners was cold and repulsive\\", he wrote. \\"The Tartar did not return home laden with silver and gold, and therefore my toils and dangers counted for nothing\\".Morrell, p. 251 = Third voyage: West African coast = African slaves In 1828 Morrell was engaged by Messrs. Christian Bergh & Co. to take command of the schooner Antarctic (named, he claims, in honour of his earlier Antarctic achievements).Morrell, pp. 253‚Äì54 Antarctic left New York on June 25, 1828, bound for Western Africa. During the following months Morrell carried out an extensive survey of the African coast between the Cape of Good Hope and Benguela, and led several short excursions inland. He was impressed by the commercial potential of this coast, recording that \\"many kinds of skins may be procured about here, including those of the leopard, fox, bullock, together with ostrich feathers and valuable minerals\\".Morrell, p. 294 At Ichaboe Island he discovered huge deposits of guano, 25 feet thick. In the face of such opportunity he records his belief that a $30,000 investment would produce in two years a profit \\"from ten to fifteen hundred per cent.\\" During the voyage Morrell experienced several encounters with the slave trade, first at the Cape Verde Islands, then a centre for the trade because of its geographical position in relation to the Americas, Europe and Africa.Stewart et al., p. 15 He found the slaves' conditions wretched, but was impressed by their passion for music which, he thought, \\"can alleviate even the pangs caused by the galling fetters of slavery\\".Morrell, p. 261 Later in the voyage he witnessed what he describes as \\"horrid barbarity\\", including the spectacle of two women slaves in their death agonies as a result of floggings. A lengthy soliloquy in his journal on the evils of slavery concludes: \\"[T]he root, the source, the foundation of the evil is the ignorance and superstition of the poor negroes themselves\\".Morrell, pp. 328‚Äì30 On June 8, 1829, Morrell wrote in his journal: \\"The voyage had been prosperous beyond our expectations, and any further stay on the African coast would have been a waste of time and money\\".Morrell, p. 331 He arrived in New York on July 14.Morrell, p. 333 = Fourth voyage: South Seas and Pacific Ocean= A Pacific war canoe, with warriors. Morrell's party encountered similar armed vessels during its skirmishes in the Pacific isles. According to Morrell, Antarctic's owners were unanimous that he should make another voyage with the ship,Morrell, p. 337 and in September 1829 Antarctic left New York, bound for the South Atlantic and Pacific in search of seals. At her own insistence, and against Morrell's and the owners' advice, his wife Abby Jane Morrell accompanied him.Fairhead, pp. 46‚Äì47 By January 1830 Antarctic had reached the Auckland Islands, south of New Zealand, where Morrell had hoped for a rich harvest of seal, but found the waters empty.W. J. Mills, p. 39 He sailed north for Manila in the Philippines, hoping to find a commercial cargo there, and arrived in March 1830.Fairhead, pp. 48‚Äì50 No such cargo was available, but Morrell was persuaded by the American consul, George Hubbell, that a potentially profitable enterprise would be to collect sea cucumbers (otherwise known as \\"B√™che-du-mer\\"), plentifully available in the islands now known as Micronesia. These could then be taken to China where they were much prized. Chapter 12, line 32 Abby Jane Morrell Hubbell would not permit Antarctic to sail with Abby on board; possibly he had designs on her.Fairhead, pp. 50‚Äì52 Morrell sailed from Manila without her, and initially had little luck in finding sea cucumbers in any quantity. Eventually Antarctic reached the Carteret Islands, a small atoll which now forms part of Papua New Guinea, and found sea cucumbers in abundance.Fairhead, p. 53 Morrell set up camp on one of the islands, where he faced a hostile reception from the population, who were nevertheless intrigued by their first sight of metal. There were thefts of tools; Morrell responded by holding several chiefs as hostages, at which the islanders mounted a full- scale attack on Morrell's shore base. Fourteen crew members were killed; Antarctic was forced to make a hasty withdrawal, leaving much equipment behind.Fairhead, p. 54 Morrell retreated to Manila, planning retaliation. He hired a large number of Manilans to augment his crew, and with a help of a loan from the British consul, adapted Antarctica and fitted her with guns and cannons. The ship, with Abby now on board, returned to the Carteret Islands and attacked with gunfire. After a series of such assaults and heavy casualties, the population sued for peace.Fairhead, pp. 55‚Äì56 This enabled Morrell to occupy one of the islands in exchange for cutlery, trinkets, tools and other metal artefacts.Morrell, p. 440 The peace was temporary; Morrell's shore camp was continually harassed by the population. Finally, Morrell decided to abandon the enterprise, citing the \\"unappeasable vindictiveness and incessant hostilities\\" of the native population.Morrell, p. 452 On November 13, 1830, while returning to Manila, Antarctica anchored off the coast of the island of Uneapa (in today's West New Britain Province).Fairhead, p. 56 A flotilla of native canoes approached the ship, full of apparently well-armed and aggressive islanders. After his experiences at Carteret Island, Morrell took no chances and ordered his crew to fire. The small craft were shattered; many died, while others manage to regain the shore. One man, who had clung to Antarctic's rudder, was hauled on board as a prisoner. The crew named him \\"Sunday\\"‚Äîhis actual name was Dako.Fairhead, pp. 22‚Äì24 An account of this engagement was entered into the ship's log by John Keeler, the ship's young navigator. Just over a week later, on November 22, a skirmish in the Ninigo Islands brought Morrell another captive, whom the crew named \\"Monday\\" (his true name was never discovered).Fairhead, pp. 57‚Äì58 With two native prisoners, but little else to show from this venture, Antarctic returned to Manila in mid-December.Fairhead, pp. 71‚Äì72 By now desperate for some profitable activity, Morrell made some money by displaying Dako and Monday to a fascinated public.Fairhead, pp. 69‚Äì70 The only maritime opportunity available was to take a cargo to C√°diz, which he was obliged to accept. He left Manila on January 13, 1831, taking his captives with him. When Antarctic reached C√°diz five months later the port was under quarantine and closed. He was forced to discharge the cargo in Bordeaux, where Dako and Monday, rumored in the town to be cannibals, again attracted great curiosity. Antarctic finally reached New York on August 27, 1831; despite his lack of commercial success, Morrell remained upbeat about future prospects in the Pacific. \\"I could, with only a modest share of patronage ... open a new avenue of trade more lucrative than any that our country has ever yet enjoyed, and further, it would be in my power, and mine alone, to secure the monopoly for any term I pleased.\\"Morrell, p. 341 In the final paragraph of his account of the Morrell records that his wife's father, her aunt and her aunt's child had all died during his absence, as had one of Morrell's cousins and her husband.Morrell, p. 492 Later careerMoney-making= When he returned to New York after his profitless fourth voyage, Morrell was heavily in debt and in urgent need of funds.Fairhead, p. 75 Newspapers showed great interest in the story of the voyage, and Morrell was keen to cash in.Fairhead, p. 76 Within a few days of his arrival he had organised a stage show, entitled \\"Two Cannibals of the Islands of the South Pacific\\". This spectacle, embellished with accounts of the massacre at Carteret Island and other dramatic inclusions, played to large crowds at New York's Rubens Peale museum.Fairhead, pp. 76‚Äì83 In October 1831 Morrell took the show on a tour, which began in Albany on October 10. Among those who visited the show was the 12-year-old Herman Melville, the future author of Moby-Dick, who may have based the character of Queequeg on his memory of Dako.Fairhead, pp. 92‚Äì93 The tour proceeded to Philadelphia, Baltimore and finally Washington DC, before ending in January 1832, at which point Morrell returned the show to Peale's.Fairhead, p. 103 Morrell's second projected source of funds was his account of his voyages, which the firm of J. and J. Harper were willing to publish.Fairhead, p. 107‚Äì9, 359 They engaged an experienced writer and dramatist, Samuel Woodworth, to make sense of Morrell's notes and sea journals, although Woodworth's role as ghost writer was not made public.Fairhead, pp. 141‚Äì42 Abby Morrell's journals received similar treatment from another established author, Samuel Knapp. His book was published in December 1832, hers early in 1833. Morrell's was very successful and sold well; the New York Mirror found it \\"a highly interesting and instructive work\\", with \\"stirring adventures and much geographical and nautical information\\". France's leading explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville was complimentary, acknowledging Morrell as \\"courageous, skilled and dedicated\\";Fairhead, p. 143 the explorer and journalist Jeremiah Reynolds, on the other hand, observed that the account contained more poetry than truth. Abby's book attracted less attention. It purported to be written to promote \\"the amelioration of the condition of the American seaman\\", a subject in which she had not otherwise evinced interest.Fairhead, p. 122 Woodworth exploited the public's curiosity by preparing a stage play, The Cannibals, which opened at the Bowery Theatre, New York, in March 1833 and had a lengthy and successful run.Fairhead, p. 144‚Äì46 Morrell's ghosted account was one of the sources used by Edgar Allan Poe in his novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.Peeples, p. 56 =Return to the Pacific= With the restoration of his fortunes and his new-found fame, Morrell began plans for a further Pacific voyage, intending to return Dako and Monday to their islands and exploit further trading opportunities. Having lobbied unsuccessfully for Congressional funding,Fairhead, pp. 101‚Äì02 Morrell eventually found backers who secured a converted brigantine, Margaret Oakley, in which he set sail from New York on March 9, 1834. Among the crew was Samuel Woodworth's 18-year-old son Selim Woodworth, whose journals and letters provided a record of the voyage.Fairhead, pp. 164‚Äì65 Monday was not with them; he had died a year previously.Fairhead, p. 138 Margaret Oakley took the westerly route to the Pacific, across the Atlantic to the Cape Verde Islands, then south to the Cape of Good Hope and across the Indian Ocean,Fairhead, pp. 167‚Äì69 arriving in the vicinity of Dako's home islands in November 1834. Dako was received rapturously by his people, as one who had returned from the dead.Fairhead, 173‚Äì74 Morrell remained in the area for several months, exploring and collecting artefacts, before departing in April 1835 for Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) in Australia for repairs and repainting.Fairhead, pp. 220‚Äì21 By June, Morrell was back among the Pacific islands, where he took his final leave of Dako.Fairhead, pp. 225‚Äì26 After a fruitless interval prospecting for gold on the New Guinea mainland, Morrell took the ship to Canton in China,Fairhead, pp. 227‚Äì33 where he found a valuable cargo for New York on which he anticipated a profit of $100,000.Fairhead, pp. 235‚Äì36 After leaving Canton on November 14, Margaret Oakley was delayed in Singapore by bad weather, where some of the cargo was sold to pay for repairs.Fairhead, p. 237 The ship left Singapore on December 31, 1835, and was seen off Mauritius in early February 1836, but then disappeared.Fairhead, p. 239 She was given up for lost with all her crew before, months later, news arrived in Mauritius that she had been wrecked on the coast of Madagascar. The crew was rescued, although much of the ship's cargo was lost in the wreck,Fairhead, pp. 241‚Äì43 and more was used to pay off the rescuers and other of Morrell's debts. When representatives of the insurers arrived in Madagascar to assess the loss, they discovered that Morrell had departed, taking part of the remaining cargo with him. He found his way to South Africa, where he boarded a British ship, Rio Packet, bound for London.Fairhead, pp. 247‚Äì49 Outside US jurisdiction, he was beyond the reach of the American authorities, who equated his actions with piracy. =Final years and death= In London early in 1837, Morrell attempted to convert some of the purloined cargo into cash, but word of his activities had spread, and the proceeds were immediately confiscated by agents acting for Margaret Oakley's insurers.Fairhead, pp. 250‚Äì51 His reputation as a probable fraud prevented him from finding new employment; he sought work with the shipping firm of Enderby Brothers, but Charles Enderby said that \\"he had heard so much of [Morrell] that he did not think fit to enter into any engagement with him.\\"Gould, p. 255 Thwarted in London, Morrell turned his attention to France. He had heard that d'Urville was organising an expedition to the Antarctic, and on June 20, 1837, wrote to the French Geographical Society in Paris to offer his services: \\"I will engage to place the Proud Banner of France ten degrees nearer the Pole than any other Banner has ever been planted, providing I can obtain the command of a Small schooner ...properly manned and equipped\\".Fairhead, pp. 253‚Äì54 His offer was declined;H. R. Mill, pp. 110‚Äì11 Morrell was by now regarded as a fraud in France as well as in Britain and America.Fairhead, pp. 256‚Äì57 It is not known how Morrell supported himself during his months in London; it is possible that Abby sent him funds from America.Fairhead, pp. 272‚Äì73 Somehow, in the autumn of 1837 he made his way to Havana in Cuba, after which his movements are unclear. It appears that he eventually obtained command of a vessel, possibly the Christine, and that he sailed in September 1838,Fairhead, pp. 268‚Äì70 probably planning a return to the Pacific. He got no further than Mozambique on the East African coast; his ship was wrecked, and Morrell was stranded ashore. He is reported to have died, either of fever or during an insurrection, in late 1838 or early 1839. This story is complicated by an alternative account indicating that Christine was wrecked a year later, early in 1840, although whether Morrell was alive and in command by that date is unrecorded. Christine was known as a slave ship, which raises the possibility that in his final years Morrell was engaged with the slave trade. Fairhead suggests an alternative hypothesis: that Morrell staged his death in Mozambique, to evade Margaret Oakley's insurers. In this scenario he may have escaped to South America and lived out his days there. A letter dated August 11, 1843, to the editor of The New York Commercial Advertiser and signed \\"Morrell\\" could, Fairhead maintains, only have been written by someone with intimate knowledge of the Oakley voyage. Fairhead offers no explanation why Morrell, if alive, should break his silence other than: \\"Perhaps, like many criminals, he could not resist flaunting himself\\".Fairhead, pp. 316‚Äì19 There is little documented history for Abby Morrell after 1838: two records, respectively dated 1841 and 1850, place her in New York, but details of her life and eventual death are unknown. Assessment Despite Morrell's exposure as a fraud, following the Margaret Oakley debacle, his contemporaries did not uniformly denounce him. To some, he was \\"the biggest liar in the Pacific\\", while d'Urville, who had earlier warmly praised Morrell's Four Voyages account, turned on the American and accused him of fabricating many of his supposed discoveries.Fairhead, pp. 286‚Äì88 However, Jeremiah Reynolds, who had expressed scepticism over the narrative, included Morrell's Pacific discoveries in his report to Congress A Report in relation to islands, reefs, and shoals in the Pacific Ocean.House Document 105, 23rd Congress, Second Session 1835 This, says Simpson-Housley, was surely a compliment to the otherwise disgraced navigator. Later commentators and historians have tended to assess his career with a degree of sympathy. Hugh Robert Mill of the Royal Geographical Society, writing in 1905, considered that a man may be ignorant and boastful, yet still do solid work. Mill thought Morrell \\"intolerably vain, and as great a braggart as any hero of autobiographical romance\\", but still found the narrative itself \\"most entertaining\\". Rupert Gould, writing in 1928, thought that Morrell may have been boastful and self-aggrandizing, but that did not make him a deliberate liar. Gould points to the accurate information provided by Morrell on the discovery of the guano deposits on Ichaboe Island, which laid the foundations of a flourishing industry.Gould, p. 268 William Mills, a much more recent commentator, echoes the view that \\"something may be salvaged from Morrell's account, although much of it must be discarded\\". In regard to the Antarctic discoveries, which are Mills's particular concern, he points out that these are given no special emphasis. Morrell does not seem to regard the Antarctic expedition as particularly remarkable, and the discovery of \\"New South Greenland\\" is not claimed by Morrell himself but is credited to Captain Johnson in 1821. In the preface to his Four Voyages book, Morrell admits that he incorporated the experiences of others into his account.Morrell, Preface (\\"advertisement\\") to A Narrative of Four Voyages Paul Simpson-Housley suggests that as well as adapting Weddell's narrative as his own experience, Morrell may have taken the details of his 1823 visit to Bouvet Island from the records of an 1825 visit by Captain George Norris,Simpson-Housley, p. 60 As a reminder of Morrell's brief Antarctic exploits, Morrell Island, at 59¬∞27'S, 27¬∞19'W, is an alternative name for Thule Island in the Southern Thule sub-group of the South Sandwich Islands. During his Pacific travels Morrell encountered groups of islands that were not on his charts, treated them as new discoveries and named them after various New York acquaintances ‚Äì Westervelt, Bergh, Livingstone, Skiddy.Morrell, pp. 376, 381‚Äì82, 388 One was named \\"Young William Group\\" after Morrell's infant son.Morrell, p. 389 None of these names appear in modern maps, although the \\"Livingstone Group\\" has been identified with Namonuito Atoll, and \\"Bergh's Group\\" with the Chuuk Islands.

This is done for several reasons: * To refine a poorly designed or complicated interface * Allow code to work together which otherwise cannot (e.g. incompatible data formats) * Enable cross language and/or runtime interoperability Wrapper libraries can be implemented using the adapter, fa√ßade, and to a lesser extent, proxy design patterns.  Structure and implementation  The specific way in which a wrapper library is implemented is highly specific to the environment it is being written in and the scenarios which it intends to address. This is especially true in the case when cross language/runtime interoperability is a consideration. = Example = The following provides a general illustration of a common wrapper library implementation. In this example, a C++ interface acts as a \\"wrapper\\" around a C-language interface.  C interface  int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t * mutex , pthread_mutexattr_t * attr); int pthread_mutex_destroy (pthread_mutex_t * mutex); int pthread_mutex_lock (pthread_mutex_t * mutex ); int pthread_mutex_unlock (pthread_mutex_t * mutex );  C++ wrapper  class Mutex { pthread_mutex_t mutex; public: Mutex() { pthread_mutex_init(&mutex;, 0); } ~Mutex() { pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex;); } private: friend class Lock; void lock() { pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex;); } void unlock() { pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex;); } }; class Lock { private: Mutex &mutex; public: Lock(Mutex &mutex;): mutex{mutex} { mutex.lock(); } ~Lock() { mutex.unlock(); } }; The original C interface can be regarded as error prone, particularly in the case where users of the library forget to unlock an already locked mutex. The new interface effectively utilizes RAII (Resource Acquisition is Initialization) in the new \`Mutex\` and \`Lock\` classes to ensure \`Mutex\`s are eventually unlocked and \`pthread_mutex_t\` objects are automatically released. The above code closely mimics the implementation of \`boost::scoped_lock\` and \`boost::mutex\` which are part of the boost::thread library. = Driver wrappers = Cross- language/runtime interoperability  Some wrapper libraries exist to act as a bridge between a client application and a library written using an incompatible technology. For instance, a Java application may need to execute a system call. However system calls are typically exposed as C library functions. To resolve this issue Java implements wrapper libraries which make these system calls callable from a Java application. In order to achieve this, languages like Java provide a mechanism called foreign function interface that makes this possible. Some examples of these mechanisms include: * Java Native Interface (JNI) * Java Native Access (JNA) * A foreign function library for Python * Managed Extensions * SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator)  Existing wrapper libraries  Some examples of existing wrapper libraries: * Pthreads for WIN32 * OpenGL Bindings for Python * MySQL++ * JavaCV See also * Wrapper function * Wrapper pattern * Glue code Category:Computer libraries ","title":"Wrapper library"},{"id":"21657697","text":"Hermann Grapow (September 1, 1885 in Rostock ‚Äì August 24, 1967 in Berlin) was a German Egyptologist.

He later served on the Bernie Goetz jury and wrote a book about it called Subway Gunman.  Biography  Mark Lesly grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he discovered two important passions of his life, Taekwondo and acting. While studying acting at New York University, an open-casting call looking for short, fair-haired, physically fit young men in their late teens or early 20s aired on WNEW radio. He was immediately cast as a Ducky Boy and was the focus of the most memorable of the gang's scenes. He apprenticed with The Bond Street Theatre Coalition, then formed his own street theater company, Questers & Jesters, with J. David Brimmer and Beverly Branum, performed Shakespeare (Kings County Shakespeare Company, Actors Classical Troupe), wrote, produced and acted in his own plays (Clockworks Theatre) and paid his bills by becoming a Taekwondo teacher. A student of the legendary Grand Master Dong Keun Park (undefeated Korean Champion and Head Coach of the USA Olympic Taekwondo Team at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992), he founded the NYU Sport Taekwondo Club in 1987, and continues to serve as the team's Head Coach. He is currently an 8th Dan Black Belt, certified by the World Taekwondo Headquarters (Kukkiwon) in South Korea, and recently received his 9th Dan from the Jidokwan, one of the original Kwans of Taekwondo, which makes him officially a Grand Master in Taekwondo. GM Lesly was the USA Taekwondo Forms Champion for 4th Degree Black Belts and higher in 1996 after winning the Silver Medal in 1995. At different times he has served as the Northeast Regional Director for the National Collegiate Taekwondo Association, as Vice President of the National Association of State Taekwondo Organizations and as Vice President of the NJ State Taekwondo Association. He was a Member of the Board of the East Coast Taekwondo Conference (formerly known as the Ivy/Northeast Collegiate Taekwondo League) from its founding in 1991 until he retired from the position in 2004. In 2016, GM Lesly was selected to be the Chair for Maccabi USA Taekwondo, and his team won five bronze medals in the 2017 World Maccabi Games held in Israel. In 2018 he became the Chairman of Jewish American Taekwondo, a 501(c)(3) non-profit to raise funds to support Jewish athletes. He has trained over one hundred students to the rank of Black Belt and beyond, including Master Albert Lee (6th Dan), who coached the NYU Team for 8 years, and Master Andre Chi (5th Dan). After serving on the Bernie Goetz jury, his acting skills made him a natural for talks shows, most notably Larry King and Phil Donahue's. He also wrote a book based on his experience as a juror and explains how the jury came to its decision. Goetz cites Lesly's book on Goetz' eccentric website,BernieForMayor.com as the source of accurate information about the incident. Lesly recently filmed interviews for documentaries on the Goetz Trial by both Fox News and Netflix. Lesly formerly taught 7th & 8th Grade language arts at Queen City Academy Charter School in Plainfield, 6th Grade at the John L. Costley Middle School in East Orange, 11th & 12th Grade at The Great Falls Academy HS in Paterson, and is currently teaching 6th, 7th and 8th Grade English at Yeshiva Ktana in Passaic. He is certified both as a K-12 Language Arts and K-12 Theater Teacher in New Jersey. He is married to the former Leslie Klouser and has one son, Jalen, who was born in 1998.

The Eclipse story runs from the company's start up in 1998, through the design and production of 260 examples of the Eclipse 500 very light jet, development of the Eclipse 400 single-engined jet, to the company's downfall and dissolution in bankruptcy in 2009. Significance Aviation analysts are still tallying the impact that the company will have on 21st Century aviation. J. Mac McClellan, Editor in Chief of Flying Magazine, in February 2009 summarized the significance of Eclipse: Richard Aboulafia, Vice President, Analysis, Teal Group in his consultant's report on Eclipse of October 2008 said: AVweb Editor-in-Chief Russ Niles stated: The failure of Eclipse has even changed the language of aviation. By late 2009 the term Very Light Jet had become so tainted by Eclipse's \\"billion-dollar debacle\\" who trumpeted that term widely, that most manufacturers were avoiding use of the term to describe their products. The NBAA's Brian Foley explained \\"The term VLJ was at times tainted by ... unrealistic expectations and even failure. The industry would do well to drop hyped words in order to improve credibility with users.\\" Cessna never used the term to describe its Mustang, Embraer labels its Phenom 100 an \\"entry-level jet\\" and Stratos has described its jet as \\"not a VLJ ... but a very light personal jet.\\" In December 2010 AVweb's Paul Bertorelli added, \\"personal jet is the description du jour. You don't hear the term VLJ‚Äîvery light jet--much anymore and some people in the industry tell me they think it's because that term was too tightly coupled to Eclipse, a failure that the remaining players want to, understandably, distance themselves from.\\" Timeline ;1998‚Äì2002 Eclipse Aviation Corporation was founded in 1998 by Microsoft employee #18 Vern Raburn. Due to Raburn's relationship with Microsoft, Bill Gates became a major stakeholder early in the Eclipse project. Raburn and his team initially based the company in Scottsdale, Arizona, formed a Board of Directors in 1999 and started design work on the first aircraft. Due to investments made by the State of New Mexico and incentives and concessions from the City of Albuquerque, the company decided to set up its production facilities in Albuquerque, and also moved its headquarters there in 2000. The Eclipse service center at Gainesville Regional Airport In addition to its factory in Albuquerque, Eclipse established three service centers, at Albuquerque, at Gainesville Regional Airport in Florida, and at Albany International Airport in New York. Preliminary design work on the Eclipse 500 was completed in 2000. The design was finalized in 2001 and construction of the first prototype commenced that year. The prototype first flew on 26 August 2002, powered by two Williams International EJ22 turbofans. ;November 2002 The Eclipse 500 had been designed around the Williams International EJ22 turbofan engine and the aircraft's selling price and operating economics hinged on the use of that engine. The prototype Eclipse 500 only flew once with the EJ22s installed. Eclipse CEO Vern Raburn said that the engines never delivered the rated thrust and that the problems were not just developmental in nature. Williams International responded by stating that the engines met all the contractual obligations and that Eclipse simply demanded more thrust than the engine was capable of providing. ;December 2004 As a replacement powerplant Eclipse selected the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW610F-A turbofan. This change required significant airframe redesign and introduced integration challenges. The prototype equipped with the PW610F engines first flew on 31 December 2004. The engine change caused a thirty- month delay in the Eclipse program and the forecast first customer deliveries. ;February 2006 In February 2006 the National Aeronautic Association named Eclipse Aviation as the winner of the prestigious Collier Trophy for 2005. Specifically the award was for: The award was controversial, as the NAA states that the prize is awarded \\"for the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America, with respect to improving the performance, efficiency, and safety of air or space vehicles, the value of which has been thoroughly demonstrated by actual use during the preceding year.\\" At the time of the award, prototype EA500s were flying but certification by the FAA was still 9 months away. The aircraft was not fully certified until 30 September 2006 and the first customer aircraft was not delivered until 2007. Critics indicated that the EA500 did not meet the stated criteria, although Eclipse Aircraft defended the award as justified. Richard Aboulafia termed it \\"a highly suspect award decision that managed to demean all the other worthy recipients and the Collier itself.\\" ;September 2006 The Eclipse 500 was FAA certified on 30 September 2006 under the official designation Eclipse Aviation EA500. ;January 2007 The first customer EA500 was delivered in early January 2007. ;July 2007 Eclipse Concept Jet On 23 July 2007 at AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin Eclipse unveiled the already flying prototype of a second company design initially called the Eclipse Concept Jet. The four-seat aircraft was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PW610F turbofan and was built in secrecy at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia by Swift Engineering and Basis. The ECJ had first flown on 2 July 2007. At the time of its announcement the aircraft was expected to have a cruise speed of at with an IFR range of . The aircraft was intended to have a gross weight, empty weight, useful load and a fuel capacity of . At the time of its announcement the company said that it did not intend to produce the aircraft. Eclipse CEO Vern Raburn said \\"The Eclipse Jet will allow us to obtain real, quantifiable data that looks at this developing category. While today we have no production plans for the ECJ, we are constantly evaluating markets for future Eclipse products ... we are anxious to reveal the potential of this emerging category, and our opportunity to add real value to it.\\" ;October 2007 In October 2007 the company furloughed some 100-150 contract workers and employees, about 10% of its workforce. ;November 2007 In November 2007 Eclipse subcontractor Hampson Aerospace, which built the tail assembly, including the fin, horizontal stabilizers, rudder and elevators for the Eclipse 500, filed suit against Eclipse alleging that Eclipse had not paid for parts which had been delivered to Eclipse. At the time Eclipse CEO Vern Raburn said of the issue: The suit was resolved in February 2008 in a confidential agreement. ;December 2007 During 2007 Eclipse produced 104 aircraft and proclaimed a record for building its \\"first 100 airplanes faster than any GA jet aircraft manufacturer in history.\\" CEO Vern Raburn described the accomplishment as \\"audacious\\" and added \\"We're transforming how jets are built, and how people travel. It's an audacious goal, and one that stretches us every day to go beyond what seems possible. Day-to-day setbacks are inevitable, but the reality is that we have created a new aircraft category and are bringing a new breed of jet to market at a rate never before seen in general aviation.\\" ;February 2008 In February 2008 the company purchased a 2005 model Cirrus SR20 light single-engined piston aircraft to be used as a company employee flying club aircraft.Walrath, Mary F.: Order (A) Authorizing The Debtors to Sell Substantially All Of Their Assets Free and Clear etc. United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 23 January 2009, Case Number 08-13031 (MFW) ;April 2008 In April 2008 Eclipse obtained a court order in California ordering Google to provide the IP addresses of 29 anonymous contributors to the Eclipse Aviation Critic NG blog, which is hosted on Google's Blogger service. The blog, run by Shane Price of Dublin, Ireland is a forum for those who are critical of the company and its treatment of employees, customers and suppliers. Eclipse CEO Vern Raburn said that the pursuit of blog contributors was not to suppress criticism, stating: \\"We're not trying to suppress dissension or criticism. We're just trying to find out where it's coming from.\\" Raburn stated that since Eclipse employees and suppliers are bound by non-disclosure agreements he wanted to ensure that these are not being broken. Price indicated that some of the identities named in the court subpoena had not posted on the blog and that these names may have come from a previous blog that was critical of Eclipse and was no longer active. The subpoena was opposed by several people in court on the basis that, since they have no connection to the company, the disclosure of their identities would violate their First Amendment rights. One contributor to the blog, Rich Lucibella, told CharterX Industry Headline News that he found Eclipse's actions \\"outrageous.\\" Lucibella said: \\"What Eclipse is attempting to do is just wrong, they want to take advantage of people's rights; I can't stand by and let them do that ... Eclipse doesn't have the right to access other people's private information. For example, if three bloggers are or were employed by Eclipse but others aren't, then the rest of the people's privacy rights are violated under the First Amendment. Eclipse hasn't appeared to invoke the rule of reason.\\" Lucibella retained attorney Norman Malinski and filed a motion in the Superior Court of California to prevent Google from releasing contributors' private information. ;May 2008 Despite earlier claims that the company would not produce the aircraft, on 30 May 2008 Eclipse Aviation began taking orders for a production version of the Eclipse Concept Jet, now designated the Eclipse 400. The 400 was at that time priced at $1.35 million and deliveries were expected to begin by the fourth quarter of 2011. ;July 2008 Founding President and CEO Vern Raburn resigned as a condition of a financing package by European Technology and Investment Research Center (ETIRC) Aviation, the company that had invested more than US$100 million in Eclipse in 2008. Raburn announced his resignation in an unexpected public event at AirVenture on Monday 28 July 2008. In departing Raburn stated that he believed Eclipse fundamentally changed aviation but he did acknowledge that events did not occur as quickly or as smoothly as he had planned. Raburn was replaced as CEO by Roel Pieper, the chairman of the board of directors and president of ETIRC. Raburn was initially offered an executive position at ETIRC; he turned it down, thus ending his relationship with Eclipse. At the time of Raburn's departure, Pieper paid tribute to Raburn saying: Pieper also said of the company in July 2008: ;August 2008 On August 3, 2008, after Vern Raburn's removal from the company, the new management at Eclipse dropped the non-disclosure legal actions against Google and the bloggers, under terms set by defending attorney Malinski. \\"If Eclipse ever goes after these 29 bloggers again, Eclipse could face financial penalties in advance of proceedings,\\" Malinski said. He also stated: \\"Freedom of speech rights includes being able to keep your identity anonymous, to be able to express freedom of speech, to have the freedom to disagree with someone else's opinion without being harassed.\\" In response to frequent rumors in the summer of the 2008 that the company would close its Albuquerque plant and relocate the operation, Eclipse issued the following statement on 14 August 2008: On 19 August 2008 Albany International, an Eclipse supplier, announced that production of the Eclipse would soon be dropping significantly.CNN Money Textile maker Albany International warns that customer Eclipse is cutting jet production On Wednesday 20 August 2008 Hampson Aerospace closed its Grand Prairie production plant, leaving Eclipse without a supplier of tail sections. In late September Hampson revised its webpage to remove details of its relationship with Eclipse. On 22 August 2008, Eclipse announced that it would be laying off 650 of its workforce of 1800 people (38% of its work force).The Canadian Press Eclipse Aviation announces layoffs of 650 workers, Archived version from 26 August 2008 Company President and CEO, Roel Pieper, said: \\"Financial stability is critical for this company and unfortunately, a reduction in workforce was necessary to achieve it. I am confident this action will set the company on the path to profitability so that we can continue to lead the very light jet category.\\" Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez reacted to the layoff notice saying: \\"This is quite serious news from Eclipse that 600 jobs will be lost. The city of Albuquerque and the state of New Mexico intend to work together to try and place those impacted by those decisions. It is our hope that in the near future, Eclipse becomes a community leader once again in Albuquerque.\\" Chavez expressed confidence in the new company management and that the company will be turned around by the end of 2008. Chavez stated: \\"In the end, if everything goes right, it will lead to even more jobs in Albuquerque. We'll see how it works out.\\" The city previously provided a number of incentives to convince Eclipse to locate in Albuquerque, including $45 million in industrial revenue bonds issued in 2004 and $770,000 in property tax abatements. The city's Economic Development Department said that Eclipse, and not the city, was responsible for the industrial revenue bonds. New Mexico had invested US$19 million in Eclipse as part of a package to get the company to locate in the state. Governor Bill Richardson indicated on 22 August 2008 that he didn't believe the situation was hopeless, stating: \\"I've been assured by the president of Eclipse that these jobs will eventually come back ... But I am concerned about the viability, in the future, of Eclipse ... I will try to help them seek additional funding and investors, but I like their long-term game plan and their short-term game plan.\\" In late August the company held a meeting for 90 of its suppliers. The meeting was intended to gather support for the company following the removal of Raburn and the layoff of the 650 employees. However by this time the majority of suppliers had already put the company on credit watch for non-payment of invoices and required cash-in-advance payments for all parts to be delivered. Ironically at his departure Raburn had laid the blame for much of the company's failures on its suppliers. On 29 August 2008 Pratt & Whitney Canada repossessed 24 engines sold to Eclipse, valued at $5,165,744.United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware: Case No 08-13031 (MFW) Statement of Financial Affairs Eclipse Aviation Corporation, page 12 In August 2008, in a communication to position holders, the company indicated that development of the Eclipse 400 was on hold.Over and Out Inc, et al.: In the United States Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware - Complaint Case 08-13031 (MFW), page 5 In August 2008 Eclipse was sued for failing to provide a refund on a cancelled order by its due date of 1 August 2008. Ice Blue Air, of London, had ordered an Eclipse 500 in 2006 and indicated that, due to the price increases, they were entitled to a refund as stipulated in the purchase agreement. The purchase agreement permitted cancellation and a full refund if the aircraft's price was raised. Eclipse disagreed and responded that no refunds would be possible until further financing was in place, anticipated at that time for the end of 2008. Eclipse was the subject of several similar delivery-related lawsuits and as many as 300 customer orders were cancelled and awaiting refunds. ;September 2008 DayJet Eclipse 500 On 25 September 2008 Robert Bigler of Cupertino, California filed suit against Eclipse for not returning his deposit of US$182,000. Eclipse filed a motion in response indicating that the \\"Plaintiff did not comply with the contract requirements for obtaining a refund, and therefore has not yet given the required 'effective notice' under the contract at issue. Plaintiff's claims therefore are premature.\\" In September and again in October 2008, Eclipse indicated that unless it received \\"funding in October or November,\\" it would not have the ability to refund customer deposits. On 19 September 2008 Eclipse's largest customer, DayJet, representing 1430 orders for the Eclipse 500, ceased flying operations for financial reasons and indicated that a return to flying was \\"unlikely\\". DayJet stated: \\"This shutdown is a direct consequence of the company's inability to arrange critical financing in the midst of the current global financial crisis. The company's operations have also suffered as a result of Eclipse Aviation's failure to install missing equipment or functionality or repair agreed technical discrepancies in accordance with the terms of DayJet's aircraft purchase contract.\\" In October 2008, Airport Journals reported more detail on the DayJet order for 1400 aircraft: Eclipse Aviation announced in October 2008 that it was acting as \\"the exclusive broker\\" and was advertising the entire DayJet fleet of 28 aircraft for sale. Canadian light aircraft fractional aircraft company OurPlane bid on the entire DayJet fleet of aircraft, offering more than \\"$500,000 each but less than $1.5 million\\" each. OurPlane operates a fleet of Cirrus SR22 aircraft and one current Eclipse 500. OurPlane planned to offer its customers one-quarter shares in the Eclipse 500s for less than US$449,000. The sale was never completed and OurPlane went into Chapter 7 liquidation in October 2010 after selling all its customer's \\"fractional ownership\\" aircraft. Eclipse Aviation announced on 23 September 2008 that it planned to establish a factory in Ulyanovsk, Russia to assemble the Eclipse 500. The Russian State Bank Vnesheconombank agreed to finance 100% of the project, providing US$205 million and would be a part-owner of the operation. The Russian State Bank supervisory board is chaired by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The Russian-based operation was intended to be jointly operated by the European Technology and Investment Research Center (ETIRC) Aviation, the Russian Federation, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Republic of Turkey. ;October 2008 On 8 October 2008, the Belgian company Royal Properties filed a lawsuit, alleging that Eclipse Aviation failed to return \\"the deposit it paid despite the occurrence of a Refund Event and Royal Properties' effective notice of demand for a refund.\\" In October 2008 when asked \\"if the Eclipse 400 project was a go or not, Eclipse said it has not begun the certification process. The company also said it has not spent any of the deposit money for the four-place, single-engine VLJ.\\" Eclipse halted production of the EA500 in October 2008 at serial number 267, although serial number 266 was completed much earlier in the year. The company indicated that it lacked the funds to continue production or to refund customer deposits for the EA500 and 400 that were owed and were the subject of outstanding lawsuits. In October 2008 a number of industry analyses and media reports were released all predicting that Eclipse would soon enter bankruptcy, production of the Eclipse 500 would end and development of the Eclipse 400 would cease. In an analysis of the company and its situation in October 2008 Richard Aboulafia, Vice President, Analysis, Teal Group in his consultant's report on Eclipse said: \\"With numerous lawsuits from suppliers and customers, Eclipse faces the prospect of involuntary or voluntary bankruptcy ... we doubt that Eclipse can survive as an ongoing business. There is a chance that additional cash injections would keep it alive for another year or two. But for now, our forecast calls for production to end in 2009.\\" On 28 October 2008 Forecast International released a report on Eclipse projecting \\"that production of the Eclipse 500 will soon end\\". They also stated: \\"Eclipse continues to produce aircraft at a low rate as it seeks to preserve cash. We have forecast production of 162 Eclipse 500s during 2008. We believe that the company will be able to push production out into early 2009 but will be forced to cease production within the first quarter of 2009 ... even this forecast may prove too optimistic ... To restructure its operations and reach profitability, Eclipse Aviation has said publicly that it needs $200‚Äì$300 million in new equity investment. With credit markets in the midst of a major crisis, Eclipse Aviation is seeking funding at a time when bankers and investors are reluctant to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a company facing an uncertain future.\\" Forecast International predicted that Eclipse would not be successful in attracting the new investment it needed to continue production past March 2009. Responding to the Teal Group and Forecast International outlooks for Eclipse, Serge Le Guellec, president and CEO of Mecaer America, a Montreal- based subcontractor who built the landing gear for the Eclipse 500, on 4 November 2008 said: \\"We are following the situation very closely. We understand that for Eclipse there are difficulties securing financing. I think we must be prudent, but I also think it is a bit premature to predict its (Eclipse's) demise by the end of the first quarter of 2009.\\" Composite manufacturer and Eclipse subcontractor Albany International indicated in its fourth quarter report, issued on 4 November 2008, that it expected Eclipse's prospects to improve in 2009: \\"... in August [2008] we announced that at Eclipse Aviation, AEC's largest customer, was substantially cutting back production. For AEC, this meant a complete stoppage of production of parts for Eclipse. We also stated in August that we expected Eclipse to ramp back up in 2009. Indications from Eclipse are that they are on track for a 2009 recovery, which would mean that AEC Production of Eclipse components would return to at least Q2 2008 rates by Q3 of 2009.\\" Colorado Springs Airport ;November 2008 In early November 2008 a group of Eclipse 500 deposit-holders proposed forcing Eclipse Aviation into involuntary bankruptcy. Their plan was to apply to a Delaware court, Eclipse's state of incorporation, indicating that the company had defrauded customers by their actions of accepting deposits for aircraft that were supposed to be delivered within six months of the deposit payment being made, but had not been delivered. Eclipse CE Roel Pieper responded to this story saying: \\"I think there will be no judge who will do that. I'm disappointed that these people think that way, but that is because of the previous culture and attitude around Eclipse, and I would have hoped that these people would give us the time to fix what needs to be fixed and then come back to us. I think most of them will understand that there are so many other financial obligations that doing something like this makes no sense, just causes more damage, and then they're not going to get any money anyway. I would be surprised if a bankruptcy judge would even go there with all the jobs at stake and all the other obligations at stake. I'm disappointed that these people hold a grudge against the company while they see the company changing.\\" On 11 November 2008 EPAC Aviation, an Australian Eclipse 500 distributor filed suit against the company for unreturned deposits. In November 2008 it was announced that Eclipse had become a \\"strategic sponsor\\" of the Amsterdam-based EclipseJet MyGuide Amsterdam basketball team with Eclipse CEO Roel Pieper as the team's new president, indicating that the company had some monetary resources available for some projects. Former CEO Vern Raburn spoke at the VLJ forum held in West Palm Beach, Florida on 12 November 2008, indicating that he no longer had any connection to the company. In his keynote address to the conference he provided further information on the events at Eclipse Aviation in 2008. Of the aviation industry he said, \\"It's fraught with people whose comment to anything new is, 'It can't be done. It hasn't been done, so it shouldn't be done.'\\" and termed the industry, \\"phenomenally sad\\". He said that the FAA is \\"100 percent political\\" and placed the blame for the Eclipse congressional hearings on unions. On his departure from Eclipse, Raburn stated that it was not voluntary: \\"I got fired. The reason I got fired was simple: I pissed off the investors.\\" Raburn went on to criticize anonymous bloggers, alluding to Eclipse Aviation Critic NG and the legal action he tried to take against them. He termed the bloggers \\"idiots and cowards ... They do it through anonymity ... They're cockroaches trying to hide under rocks.\\" On 13 November 2008 the company employees were called to a 6 am meeting by Eclipse President of Manufacturing, Peg Billson and told that they would not be paid for the past two weeks' work. Billson informed the employees that the problem was in obtaining financing from Europe and that employees should go home and await further notice. Employees \\"expressed anger, frustration and uncertainty before speeding out of the facility's parking lot.\\" State of New Mexico Economic Development Secretary Fred Mondragon said that there were indications that the banks had frozen the assets of Eclipse Aviation, saying \\"I understand the banks put a squeeze on the company, freezing their cash assets. The news is not good.\\" The Eclipse service facility in Gainesville, Florida was closed and locked up on 14 November 2008 and calls made to that company location by the media were not returned. On 14 November 2008 Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez stated that he had spoken with Peg Billson, Eclipse's President of Manufacturing, and she told him that Eclipse expects to remain solvent, despite the current payroll shortfall and that funding should become available soon. The mayor indicated that he could not support the city bailing out the company at that time. On the same day, Eclipse stated that it would pay its workers on Tuesday 18 November 2008 and that all employees were to report to work on Monday 17 November 2008. Company employees confirmed on 18 November 2008 that they had been paid for the previous two weeks' work, but expressed concerns about the next payday and whether the situation would be repeated. Also on 14 November 2008 there were a total of seven parties who had filed deposit-related lawsuits against Eclipse. By 18 November 2008 the number of lawsuits for unpaid deposit refunds had grown to ten, totaling US$7 million. On 20 November 2008 Eclipse announced a reduction in company hours for maintenance scheduling, technical services and customer care to Monday to Friday 0700-1900 MST. Outside those hours customers were asked to leave a message to be returned during business hours. The company did indicate that it would provide higher priority service for owners of aircraft that were grounded. Aviation Week & Space Technology noted that \\"regardless of technical support, several critical spare parts are no longer in inventory because many vendors have stopped shipping spares to Eclipse until they receive payment for past due bills. And they won't ship more spares to Eclipse except on a COD basis. Notably, only a few vendors will sell parts directly to customers because of previous exclusive supply contracts with Eclipse.\\" European Aviation Safety Agency certification of the EA500 for private use was achieved on 21 November 2008. In conjunction with the announcement of EASA certification, Eclipse spokesperson Alana McCarraher indicated that the past two weeks had been challenging, but said of employee morale: \\"We're just all celebrating, today.\\" Of the EASA certification she added: \\"We expect more orders to come from this.\\" On 25 November 2008 Eclipse Aviation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. At the time of its bankruptcy filing there were 21 outstanding lawsuits for breach of contract regarding unrefunded deposits for Eclipse 500s. The company stated that it was \\"seeking court approval for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and procedures for the sale of substantially all of its assets under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\\" The company also stated that it had found a buyer for the company's assets, an affiliate of ETIRC Aviation owned by Eclipse CEO Roel Pieper, the company that had made large investments in Eclipse. The buyout was subject to the receipt of other offers.United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware: Case No 08-13031 (MFW) Statement of Financial Affairs Eclipse Aviation Corporation, page 168. Documents filed by Eclipse pursuant to the bankruptcy indicated that it owed about US$577 million to its investors and US$135 million to its suppliers. The bankruptcy documents indicated that a total of US$702.6 million was owed and that the largest unsecured creditors were: *King Road Investments US$92.3 million *HBK Master Fund US$84.9 million *Fuji Heavy Industries US$31.8 million - wings *Hampson Aerospace US$31.3 million - empennage *Pratt & Whitney Canada US$30.1 million - engines *UT Finance US$13.5 million *Albany Engineered Composites US$6.9 million *DayJet US$6.2 million *TW Metals US$5.9 million *Chelton Flight Systems US$4.9 million *Innovative Solutions & Support US$4.3 million - instrument panel *Mecaer US$4.3 million - landing-gear. The court documents filed by Eclipse stated that the bankruptcy occurred because the company \\"continued to lose larger than expected sums of money on each aircraft manufactured and has not reached cash flow positive in its operations.\\" Total company liabilities were estimated at over US$1 billion. In announcing the bankruptcy action, CEO Roel Pieper said: \\"In the face of unprecedented economic challenges, it is clear that the sale of the Eclipse business through the Chapter 11 process is the right course of action to maximize the value of the business, secure its future and protect the best interests of Eclipse's stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, employees and creditors. The successful sale will position the business for aggressive global expansion, allowing the company to fulfill its promise and solidify its position as the world's leading manufacturer of VLJs.\\" Peg Billson, president and manager of the company, resigned \\"to pursue other career opportunities.\\" The bankruptcy plan whereby the company would be sold to its largest shareholder, ETIRC, was criticized as an attempt by the current owners to liquidate the company and buy it back, while eliminating debts to suppliers and customers. Russ Niles of AvWeb said: \\"That sounds suspiciously like a Chapter 7 liquidation, except that in this case the winning bidder is preordained.\\" At the time of bankruptcy filing on 25 November 2008 Eclipse had delivered 259 EA500s. Aircraft serial number 260 had been paid for on the morning of and in advance of the filing. The company had signed the bill of sale for the aircraft, but refused to release the aircraft to its owner. The aircraft had actually been ready to be delivered to the owners on 21 November 2008, but remained at the factory to have some discrepancies rectified. The keys had been given to the owners prior to the bankruptcy filing, but company security refused to let the aircraft taxi for departure. The dispute resulted in a court filed motion as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. In addition to damages and a declaratory judgment of ownership of the aircraft or the return of the money paid, the plaintiffs in the case alleged unjust enrichment, conversion and tortious interference. The bankruptcy judge noted the fate of this particular aircraft and in the final bankruptcy judgment of 23 January 2009 ordered it released to its owner within five business days of the closing of the sale of the company assets. Due to the incomplete Chapter 11 procedure and move to Chapter 7, the order was delayed. The aircraft was finally released and was registered to its owner on 4 June 2009.Gulf Coast Commercial Corp & 100 PM Inc.: Compliant for (I) Declaratory Judgment that a Certain Airplane is Not Property of the Debtors' Estatesetc. United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 23 January 2009, Case Number 08-13031 (MFW) ;December 2008 Eclipse 500 instrument panel In December 2008 Eclipse 400 position holders requesting refunds reported that their deposits had not been refunded and that telephone calls to the company were not being returned. According to the purchase contracts the deposits were fully refundable until November 2009. Court documents filed by Eclipse 400 position holders as part of the bankruptcy hearings alleged that the company misappropriated the US$3.2M collected from depositors, did not escrow it as contracted to do so and refused to refund it when required to. The Eclipse bankruptcy judgment ordered the amount held in escrow, pending the outcome of an adversarial court action of the deposits. On 17 December 2008 the existence of the Ad Hoc Customers Committee was announced. The group represented the rights of Eclipse 400 and 500 owners and position holders in the bankruptcy proceedings. The committee issued a statement saying: \\"Eclipse customers hold contracts under which Eclipse is obligated to provide warranty coverage, upgrades, uninstalled equipment, maintenance coverage, subscription services, and future aircraft deliveries. In terms of dollar amount, customers are likely the largest constituency in Eclipse's Chapter 11 case.\\" The committee was chaired by Eclipse Owners Club president David Green, who stated: \\"The Ad Hoc Customers Committee is funded by the owners and position holders in recognition that a unified voice is the most effective way to ensure that customers are fairly treated and that the Eclipse order book is preserved as one of the most valuable assets of Eclipse. Prospective purchasers of company assets must recognize that satisfied customers, many of whom have supported Eclipse for over eight years, can be the most effective marketing group for Eclipse aircraft. Finding a mutually beneficial outcome with the purchaser is our purpose; but all options are under consideration as we fulfill our mandate of protecting the interests of the customer group.\\" ;January 2009 A Delaware bankruptcy court scheduled an auction of the assets of Eclipse Aviation for 14 January 2009. EclipseJey International, the Luxembourg-based subsidiary of ETIRC Aviation, owned by Eclipse's Chairman of the Board Roel Pieper, announced that it intended to buy Eclipse, however there were indications at the time that other companies would bid on the assets as well. Former President and CEO Vern Raburn specifically stated that he would not enter a bid. The intended auction was cancelled by the court when there was only one qualified bid submitted, by ETIRC Aviation subsidiary EclipseJet Aviation International Inc. ETIRC's intention was to buy the assets of Eclipse Aviation for US$188M, including US$28M in cash and US$160M in new notes. The company offered 15% equity to senior secured creditors. A group of existing position holders representing the 30 customers who had paid deposits on aircraft that were in various states of assembly at the time of the filing argued against the sale of the assets claiming that they are the rightful owners of those aircraft and not ETIRC.EclipseJet Aviation International Inc: Statement of EclipseJet Aviation International Inc in the United States Bankruptcy Court District of Delaware, page 1. Case 08-13031 (MFW) On 20 January 2009 Federal Bankruptcy Court Judge Mary Walrath verbally approved the sale of the assets of Eclipse Aviation to EclipseJet Aviation International under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code over the objections of dozens of filed motions. The court's final judgment document, which Judge Mary Walrath signed on 23 January 2009, stated that the bankruptcy sale was carried out in good faith, that there was no collusion or fraud, that the bid process was fair and that EclipseJet International's offer was the \\"highest and best offer\\". The order transferred all assets to the new buyer and extinguished all debts and obligations of the previous company. The position holders of the incomplete airframes under construction agreed to pay an additional US$1.375M to have their aircraft completed with the exception of one position holder, A.R Airways, who intended to commence an adversarial court action over Eclipse 500 serial number 273. The 30 Eclipse 400 position holders commenced an adversarial court proceeding to recover their deposits that were allegedly to have been held in escrow. The judge ordered US$3.2M be deposited in escrow against the outcome of that case. Other Eclipse position holders and depositors for aircraft of serial number 294 and higher, not yet started, were deemed unsecured creditors. ;February 2009 A month after the sale to EclipseJet International had been approved the sale had not been completed due to lack of funds and, as a result, Eclipse Aviation's bridge financing ran out. Consequently the company sent most workers home on 18 February 2009, indicating that their employment would continue with EclipseJet International after the sale was finalized. In response New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson instructed the state Department of Workforce Solutions to provide extra resources to help the furloughed employees. On 24 February 2009 a group of companies to whom Eclipse owed money applied to the court to force the unfinished Chapter 11 proceedings into Chapter 7 instead and to shorten the normal notice requirements, citing the continued daily loss of asset value, the lay-off of most workers on 18 February 2009 and the inability of EclipseJet International to secure financing.The Ad Hoc Committee: Motion of the Ad Hoc Committee of Secured Noteholders for an Order Converting the Debtors' Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 24 February 2009, Case Number 08-13031 (MFW)The Ad Hoc Committee: Motion to Shorten Notice of the Motion of the Ad Hoc Committee of Secured Noteholders for an Order Converting the Debtors' Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 24 February 2009, Case Number 08-13031 (MFW) On 25 February 2009 Eclipse Aviation issued a statement, signed by executives Mark Borseth and Michael McConnell and notably not signed by CEO and Chairman Roel Pieper, supporting the move to Chapter 7 liquidation. Judge Mary Walrath gave approval for the conversion to Chapter 7 on 4 March 2009. In a message to the employees the company executives said: Once the company assets were available though liquidation a number of potential buyers voiced their interest in buying the assets and providing support for the existing aircraft fleet. These included New Eclipse Acquisition LLC, a new company set up for this purpose by Phil Friedman, CEO of Harlow Aerostructures of Wichita, Kansas. Friedman's plans included supporting and upgrading the existing fleet and new production of Eclipse 500s at a rate of 100 per year for a price of about US$2.4M per aircraft. Friedman's plan specified mandatory upgrades for the older aircraft in the fleet, or, alternatively if some owners were unable to afford that, to help them sell their aircraft to new owners who can. Fearful that a new owner for the type certificate and tooling would hold a monopoly on maintaining the existing fleet the Eclipse Owners Club also organized a bid. ;March 2009 With the Chapter 7 asset sale looming, a number of Eclipse owners expressed concern that two of the bids for the company assets, including the one from New Eclipse Acquisition LLC, planned to reestablish low-rate manufacturing of the Eclipse 500 primarily through forecast profits on mandatory upgrades to the existing fleet. The Eclipse Owners Group labeled these plans \\"predatory\\". \\"The idea in both of these plans is to exploit the captive market that the Eclipse customers represent,\\" stated Randall Sanada, of Jet Alliance By the middle of the month a number of plans and companies had been formed to purchase the assets. In addition to New Eclipse Acquisition LLC and Eclipse Owners Club bids, Eclipse Jet LLC which included former Eclipse CEO Roel Pieper as a director, Eclipse Services and Support LLC, a newly formed subsidiary of Linear Air. The China Commercial Aircraft Company indicated that it may submit a bid. Despite being a competitor to the Eclipse 500 Owners Club, the bid by Eclipse Jet LLC claimed to have the endorsement of the club. Industry observers questioned the role of Roel Pieper in that company's bid as he was the subject of several legal actions in the failed Chapter 11 take-over and also for not meeting the federal 60-day notice regulations for laying off employees. Despite entering Chapter 7 bankruptcy on 24 February 2009, by the end of March 2009 no date had been set for the auction of the company assets. ;April 2009 With the Chapter 7 sale date still not set the various parties interested in acquiring the company assets continued to position themselves for the auction. The Eclipse Owners Group, representing members of the aircraft type club, announced that they had signed a Letter of Intent with Hawker Beechcraft to provide services in the event that the EOG wins the assets. The deal with Hawker Beechcraft would see that company provide maintenance for the existing fleet of 260 aircraft at their facilities around the country. Working with the EOG, Randall Sanada, chairman of Jet-Alliance, also stated that his company was planning to acquire the 28 ex-DayJet aircraft that remained unsold, with the aim of making them available to Eclipse position holders at a discounted price. Sanada indicated that these aircraft require many upgrades and that these may cost US$500,000 per aircraft. On 7 April ETIRC declared bankruptcy. The Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant reported that Roel Pieper had personally invested US$146 million in Eclipse through ETIRC. On 14 April it was confirmed that the China Commercial Aircraft Corporation intended to bid on the assets of Eclipse, subject to US export restrictions on the Eclipse technology and intellectual property. ;June 2009 At the beginning of June 2009 the Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee sought an extension of the date to complete the sale of the company assets after 1 July 2009. On 24 June 2009 the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a statement suspending the Eclipse 500's type certificate, saying \\"The current Holder of the EASA Type Certificate EASA.IM.A.171 has been notified on 10 June 2009, of the Agency's decision to suspend the EASA Type Certificate EASA.IM.A.171 with effect from 12 June 2009.\\" No reason for the suspension was announced. ;July 2009 On 31 July 2009 Jeoffrey L. Burtch, the appointed Chapter 7 Trustee, filed a motion requesting the court's approval to sell the assets of Eclipse Aviation to Eclipse Aerospace a new company headed by Mike Press and Mason Holland, based in Charleston, South Carolina. The court-filed documents indicated that the assets would be sold for US$20M in cash and $20M in new notes, subject to other offers coming forth at an auction. The filing stated that if the directed sale to Eclipse Aerospace was not completed due to the auction proceeding, then Eclipse Aerospace would receive a US$1.6M \\"Break-Up Fee\\" instead. The trustee indicated to the court that he felt that this measure was justified to encourage movement towards an auction. He stated that 30 organizations had expressed interest in the assets, 12 had signed non- disclosure agreements and received complete information and six had completed tours of the Eclipse facilities, \\"however, prospective purchasers were either hesitant to make the first public bid, were unable to obtain financing, required unacceptable conditions to closing, or otherwise backed out.\\" Without approval to pay for a bid and hopefully create an action \\"the Trustee will most likely be forced to abandon or liquidate the Eclipse Assets on a piece meal basis.\\"Press, Mike & Mason Holland: Official communiqu√©, Eclipse Aerospace, 31 July 2009.Burtch, Jeoffrey L., Chapter 7 Trustee: Motion of the Chapter 7 Trustee to Approve Sale Procedures, and to Approve Sale, and for Related Relief.

The previous bid by the Eclipse Owners Group was withdrawn and their support given to Eclipse Aerospace. Other parties that had previously expressed interest, including Daher-Socata, also did not submit bids. Eclipse Aerospace indicated that they intended to retain the company in Albuquerque, provide upgrades to the current Eclipse fleet and assess whether production can be restarted at some future point. ;September 2009 Eclipse Aerospace opened for business in the old Eclipse Aviation facilities on 1 September 2009, with 15 employees.

Subsequent to the withdrawal of the Dutch administration from the Netherlands New Guinea in 1962 and implementation of Indonesian administration in 1963, the Free Papua Movement has conducted a low-intensity guerrilla war against Indonesia through the targeting of its military and police. Protests and ceremonies by Papuans raising their flag for independence or federation with Papua New Guinea, and accuse the Indonesian government of indiscriminate violence and of suppressing their freedom of expression. Indonesia has been accused of conducting a genocidal campaign against the indigenous inhabitants. According to De R. G. Crocombe, it is estimated around 100,000 Papuans have been killed in the violence, and many women raped or subjected to sexual violence. Research by the Papuan Women's Working Group together with the Asia Justice Rights (AJAR) found 64 out of a sample of 170 Papuan women have either experienced shootings, torture, sexual violence, arbitrary detention, husbands/family members lost or killed, husbands/family members detained, or property theft/damaging. and the Indonesian governance style has been compared to that of a police state, suppressing freedom of political association and political expression. The Indonesian authorities continue to restrict foreign access to the region due to what they officially claim to be \\"safety and security concerns\\". Some organizations had called for a peacekeeping mission in the area. Historical backgroundOverview= The Indonesian National Armed Forces has been accused of committing human rights abuses in Papua. In December 1949, at the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, the Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over the territories of the former Dutch East Indies, with the exception of Western New Guinea, which the Dutch continued to hold as Netherlands New Guinea. The nationalist Indonesian government argued that it was the successor state to the whole of the Dutch East Indies and wanted to end the Dutch colonial presence in the archipelago. The Netherlands argued that the Papuans were ethnically different and that the Netherlands would continue to administer the territory until it was capable of self-determination. From 1950 onwards, the Dutch and the Western powers agreed that the Papuans should be given an independent state, but due to global considerations, mainly the Kennedy administration's concern to keep Indonesia on their side of the Cold War, the United States pressured the Dutch to sacrifice Papua's independence and transfer the territory to Indonesia.Bilveer Singh, page 2 In 1962, the Dutch agreed to relinquish the territory to temporary United Nations administration, signing the New York Agreement, which included a provision that a plebiscite would be held before 1969. The Indonesian military organised this vote, called the Act of Free Choice in 1969 to determine the population's views on the territory's future; the result was in favor of integration into Indonesia. In violation of the Agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the vote was a show of hands in the presence of the Indonesian military, and only involved 1025 hand picked people who were forced at gunpoint to vote for integration, much less than 1% of those who should have been eligible to vote. The legitimacy of the vote is hence disputed by independence activists who protest the military occupation of Papua by Indonesia. Indonesia is regularly accused of human rights abuses. They include attacks on OPM-sympathetic civilians and jailing people who raise West Papua's national Morning Star flag for treason. Through the transmigration program, which since 1969 includes migration to Papua, about half of the 2.4 million inhabitants of Indonesian Papua are born in Java. intermarriage is increasing and the offspring of trans-migrants have come to see themselves as \\"Papuan\\" over their parents' ethnic group. As of 2010, 13,500 Papuan refugees live in exile in the neighbouring Papua New Guinea (PNG), and occasionally, the fighting spills over the border. As a result, the Papua New Guinea Defence Force has set up patrols along PNG's western border to prevent infiltration by the OPM. Additionally, the PNG government has been expelling resident \\"border crossers\\" and making a pledge of no anti-Indonesian activity a condition for migrants' stay in PNG. Since the late 1970s, the OPM have made retaliatory \\"threats against PNG business projects and politicians for the PNGDF's operations against the OPM\\". The PNGDF has performed joint border patrols with Indonesia since the 1980s, although the PNGDF's operations against the OPM are \\"parallel\\". =Origins= Prior to the arrival of the Dutch, two Indonesian principalities known as the Sultanate of Tidore and the Sultanate of Ternate claimed dominion over Western New Guinea. In 1660, the Dutch recognized the Sultan of Tidore's sovereignty over New Guinea. It thus became notionally Dutch as the Dutch held power over Tidore. A century later, in 1793, Britain attempted a failed settlement near Manokwari. After almost 30 years, in 1824 Britain and the Netherlands agreed to divide the land; rendering the eastern half of the island as being under British control and the western half would become part of the Dutch East Indies. In 1828, the Dutch established a settlement in Lobo (near Kaimana) which also failed. Almost 30 years later, the Germans established the first missionary settlement on an island near Manokwari. While in 1828 the Dutch claimed the south coast west of the 141st meridian and the north coast west of Humboldt Bay in 1848, Dutch activity in New Guinea was minimal until 1898 when the Dutch established an administrative center, which was subsequently followed by missionaries and traders. Under Dutch rule, commercial links were developed between West New Guinea and Eastern Indonesia. In 1883, New Guinea was divided between the Netherlands, Britain, and Germany; with Australia occupying the German territory in 1914. In 1901, the Netherlands formally purchased West New Guinea from the Sultanate of Tidore, incorporating it into the Dutch East Indies. During World War II, the territory was occupied by Japan but was later recaptured by the Allies, who restored Dutch rule. The unification of Western New Guinea with Papua New Guinea was official Australian government policy for a short period of time in the 1960s, before Indonesia's annexation of the region. Generally, proposals regarding federation with Papua New Guinea are a minority view in the freedom movement. Arguments for federation generally focus around shared cultural identity between the two halves of the island. Four years after the Indonesian National Revolution and Independence on 17 August 1945, the Netherlands formally transferred sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia, the successor state to the Dutch East Indies, on 27 December 1949. However, the Dutch refused to include Netherlands New Guinea in the new Indonesian Republic and decided to assist and prepare it for independence as a separate country. In order to resolve the differences, both countries held the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference in late 1949 but to no avail. It was decided that the present status quo of the territory would be maintained and then negotiated bilaterally one year after the date of the transfer of sovereignty. A year later, both Indonesia and the Netherlands were still unable to resolve their differences, which led Indonesian President Sukarno to accuse the Dutch of reneging on their promises to negotiate the handover of the territory. The Dutch was persistent in their argument that the territory did not belong to Indonesia because the Melanesian Papuans were ethnically and geographically different from Indonesians, and that the territory had always been administrated separately. On top of that, the Papuans did not participate in the Indonesian Revolution, and that the Papuans did not want to be under Indonesian control.Ron Crocombe, Asia in the Pacific Islands, p. 282 While at face-value, the Dutch seems to be having the Papuans‚Äô interest at heart, political scientist Arend Lijphart disagreed. He argued that other underlying Dutch motives to prevent West New Guinea from joining Indonesia included the territory's lucrative economic resources, its strategic importance as a Dutch naval base, and its potential role for housing the Netherlands' surplus population including Eurasians who had become displaced by the Indonesian National Revolution. The Dutch also wanted to maintain a regional presence and to secure their economic interests in Indonesia.Arend Lijphart, Trauma of Decolonization, pp. 25‚Äì35, 39‚Äì66 On the other hand, Indonesia regarded West New Guinea as an intrinsic part of the country on the basis that Indonesia was the successor state to the Dutch East Indies. These sentiments were reflected in the popular Indonesian revolutionary slogan ‚ÄúIndonesia Merdeka- dari Sabang sampai Merauke‚Äù \\"Indonesia Free‚Äîfrom Sabang to Merauke.Audrey Kahim, p. 45 The slogan indicates the stretch of Indonesian territory from the most western part in Sumatra, Sabang, and the most eastern part in Merauke, a small city in West New Guinea. Indonesian irredentist sentiments were also inflamed by the fact that several Indonesian political prisoners had been interned at a remote prison camp north of Merauke called Boven-Digoel prior to World War II.Benedict Anderson, p. 176 Sukarno also contended that the continuing Dutch presence in West New Guinea was an obstacle to the process of nation-building in Indonesia and that it would also encourage secessionist movements.Bob Catley, p. 20‚Äì21 =Bilateral negotiations (1950‚Äì1953)= The Netherlands and Indonesia tried to resolve the West New Guinea dispute through several rounds of bilateral negotiations between 1950 and 1953. These negotiations ended up to become unsuccessful and led the two governments to harden their stance and position. On 15 February 1952, the Dutch Parliament voted to incorporate New Guinea into the realm of the Netherlands and shortly after, the Netherlands refused further discussion on the question of sovereignty and considered the issue to be closed.Audrey Kahin, p. 45 In response, President Sukarno adopted a more forceful stance towards the Dutch. Initially, he unsuccessfully tried to force the Indonesian government to abrogate the Round Table agreements and to adopt economic sanctions but was rebuffed by the Natsir Cabinet. Undeterred by this setback, Sukarno made recovering the territory a top priority of his presidency and sought to harness popular support from the Indonesian public for this goal throughout many of his speeches between 1951 and 1952.John D. Legge, pp. 277‚Äì78 By 1953, the dispute had become the central issue in Indonesian domestic politics. All political parties across the political spectrum, particularly the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), supported Sukarno's efforts to integrate the territory into Indonesia. According to historians Audrey and George McTurnan Kahin, the PKI's pro-integration stance helped the party to rebuild its political base and to further its credentials as a nationalist Communist Party that supported Sukarno. =United Nations (1954‚Äì1957)= In 1954, Indonesia decided to take the dispute to the United Nations and succeeded in having it placed on the agenda for the upcoming ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). In response, the Dutch Ambassador to the United Nations, Herman van Roijen, warned that the Netherlands would ignore any recommendations which might be made by the UN regarding the dispute. During the Bandung Conference in April 1955, Indonesia succeeded in securing a resolution supporting its claim to West New Guinea from African and Asian countries. In addition,Jamie Mackie, Bandung, p. 86‚Äì87 Indonesia was also supported by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. In terms of international support, the Netherlands was supported by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and several Western European and Latin American countries. However, these countries were unwilling to commit to providing military support in the event of a conflict with Indonesia.Wies Platje, p. 297-98 The Eisenhower administration were open to non-violent territorial changes but rejected the use of any military means to resolve the dispute. Until 1961, the United States pursued a policy of strict neutrality and abstained on every vote on the dispute.Audrey Kahin, p. 77-79 According to the historian Nicholas Tarling, the United Kingdom took the position that it was \\"strategically undesirable\\" for control of the territory to pass to Indonesia because it created a precedent for encouraging territorial changes based on political prestige and geographical proximity. The Australian Menzies government welcomed the Dutch presence in the region as an \\"essential link\\" in its national defense since it also administrated a trust territory in the eastern half of New Guinea. Unlike the Labor Party which had supported the Indonesian nationalists, the Prime Minister Robert Menzies viewed Indonesia as a potential threat to its national security and distrusted the Indonesian leadership for supporting Japan during World War II.Bob Catley, p. 196-201 In addition, New Zealand and South Africa also opposed Indonesia's claim to the territory. New Zealand accepted the Dutch argument that the Papuans were culturally different from the Indonesians and thus supported maintaining Dutch sovereignty over the territory until the Papuans were ready for self-rule. By contrast, newly independent India, another Commonwealth member supported Indonesia's position.Nicholas Taling, p. 19 Between 1954 and 1957, Indonesia and their Afro-Asian allies made three attempts to get the United Nations to intervene. All these three resolutions, however, failed to gain a two‚Äìthirds majority in the UNGA. On 30 November 1954, the Indian representative Krishna Menon initiated a resolution calling for Indonesia and the Netherlands to resume negotiations and to report to the 10th UNGA Session. This resolution was sponsored by eight countries (Argentina, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, India, Syria, and Yugoslavia) but failed to secure a two-thirds majority (34-23-3).Nicholas Tarling, p. 59-60 In response to growing tensions between Jakarta and the Hague, Indonesia unilaterally dissolved the Netherlands-Indonesian Union on 13 February 1956, and also rescinded compensation claims to the Dutch. Undeterred by this setback, Indonesia resubmitted the dispute to the UNGA agenda in November 1965.Nicholas Tarling, p. 104-105, p. 114-115 On 23 February 1957, a 13 country‚Äìsponsored resolution (Bolivia, Burma, Ceylon, Costa Rica, Ecuador, India, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, and Yugoslavia) calling for the United Nations to appoint a \\"good offices commission\\" for West New Guinea was submitted to the UNGA. Despite receiving a plural majority (40-25-13), this second resolution failed to gain a two-thirds majority. Undeterred, the Afro-Asian caucus in the United Nations lobbied for the dispute to be included on the UNGA agenda. On 4 October 1957, Indonesia's Foreign Minister Subandrio warned that Indonesia would embark on \\"another cause\\" if the United Nations failed to bring about a solution to the dispute that favoured Indonesia. That month, the PKI and affiliated trade unions lobbied for retaliatory economic measures against the Dutch. On 26 November 1957, a third Indonesian resolution on the West New Guinea dispute was put to the vote but failed to gain a two- thirds majority (41-29-11). =West Papua's national identity= Following the recent defeat at the UN, Indonesia embarked on a national campaign targeting Dutch interests in Indonesia;Nicholas Tarling, pp. 114‚Äì19 leading to the withdrawal of the Dutch flag carrier KLM's landing rights, mass demonstrations, and the seizure of the Dutch shipping line Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij (KPM), Dutch-owned banks, and other estates. By January 1958, 10,000 Dutch nationals had left Indonesia, many returning to the Netherlands. This spontaneous nationalisation had adverse repercussions on Indonesia's economy, disrupting communications and affecting the production of exports. President Sukarno also abandoned efforts to raise the dispute at the 1958 UNGA, claiming that reason and persuasion had failed.John D. Legge, p. 330-33 Following a sustained period of harassment against Dutch diplomatic representatives in Jakarta, Indonesia formally severed relations with the Netherlands in August 1960.John D. Legge, p. 402-03 In response to Indonesian aggression, the Netherlands stepped up its efforts to prepare the Papuans for self-determination in 1959. These efforts culminated in the establishment of a hospital in Hollandia (modern‚Äìday Jayapura), a shipyard in Manokwari, agricultural research sites, plantations, and a military force known as the Papuan Volunteer Corps. By 1960, a legislative New Guinea Council had been established with a mixture of legislative, advisory and policy functions had been established. Half of its members were to be elected and elections for this council were held the following year.Wies Platje, p. 298 Most importantly, the Dutch also sought to create a sense of West Papuan national identity and these efforts led to the creation of a national flag (the Morning Star flag), a national anthem, and a coat of arms. The Dutch had planned to transfer independence to West New Guinea in 1970.Ron Crocombe, p. 286 Preparation of independence By 1960, other countries in the Asia- Pacific had taken notice of the dispute and began proposing initiatives to end it. During a visit to the Netherlands, the New Zealand Prime Minister Walter Nash suggested the idea of a united New Guinea state, consisting of both Dutch and Australian territories. This idea received little support from both Indonesia and other Western governments. Later that year, the Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman proposed a three-step initiative, which involved West New Guinea coming under United Nations trusteeship. The joint administrators would be three non-aligned nations Ceylon, India, and Malaya, which supported Indonesia's position. This solution involved the two belligerents, Indonesia and the Netherlands, re-establishing bilateral relations and the return of Dutch assets and investments to their owners. However, this initiative was scuttled in April 1961 due to opposition from Indonesia's Foreign Minister Subandrio, who publicly attacked Tunku's proposal.Michael Green, p. 159-60 By 1961, the Netherlands was struggling to find adequate international support for its policy to prepare West New Guinea for independent status under Dutch guidance. While the Netherlands' traditional Western allies‚Äîthe United States, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand‚Äîwere sympathetic to Dutch policy, they were unwilling to provide any military support in the event of conflict with Indonesia.Wies Platje, p. 298-99 On 26 September 1961, the Dutch Foreign Minister Joseph Luns offered to hand over the territory to a United Nations trusteeship. This proposal was firmly rejected by his Indonesian counterpart Subandrio, who likened the dispute to Katanga's attempted secession from the Republic of Congo during the Congo Crisis. By October 1961, Britain was open to transferring West New Guinea to Indonesia while the United States floated the idea of a jointly- administered trusteeship over the territory.Nicholas Tarling, p. 359-374 Call for resumption of Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian talks On 23 November 1961, the Indian delegation at the United Nations presented a draft resolution calling for the resumption of Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian talks on terms which favoured Indonesia. Two days later, several Francophone countries in Africa tabled a rival resolution which favoured an independent West New Guinea. Indonesia favoured India's resolution while the Dutch, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand supported the Francophone African one. On 27 November 1961, both the Francophone African (52-41-9) and Indian (41-40-21) resolutions were put to the vote failed to gain a two‚Äìthirds majority at the UNGA. The failure of this final round of diplomacy in the UN convinced Indonesia to prepare for a military invasion.Nicholas Tarling, p. 400-18 =New York Agreement, UN administration and Act of Free Choice= By 1961, the United States had become concerned about the Indonesian military's purchase of Soviet weapons and equipment for a planned invasion of West New Guinea. The Kennedy administration feared an Indonesian drift towards Communism and wanted to court Sukarno away from the Soviet bloc and Communist China. The United States also wanted to repair relations with Jakarta, which had deteriorated due to the Eisenhower administration's covert support for regional uprisings in Sumatra and Sulawesi. These factors convinced the Kennedy administration to intervene diplomatically to bring about a peaceful solution to the dispute, which favored Indonesia.Audrey Kahin, p. 217-21 Throughout 1962, US diplomat Ellsworth Bunker facilitated top‚Äìsecret high‚Äìlevel negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. This produced a peace settlement known as the New York Agreement on 15 August 1962. As a face-saving measure, the Dutch would hand over West New Guinea to a provisional United Nations Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA) on 1 October 1962, which then ceded the territory to Indonesia on 1 May 1963; formally ending the dispute. As part of the agreement, it was stipulated that a popular plebiscite would be held in 1969 to determine whether the Papuans would choose to remain in Indonesia or seek self-determination. Implementation of Indonesian governance was followed by sporadic fighting between Indonesian and pro-Papuan forces until 1969. Following the referendum in 1969, the territory was formally integrated into Indonesia. Instead of 816,000 Papuans, only 1,022 Papuan tribal representatives were allowed to vote and all of these were coerced into voting in favour of integration. While several international observers including journalists and diplomats criticised the referendum as being rigged, the United States and Australia supported Indonesia's efforts to secure acceptance in the United Nations for the pro-integration vote. That same year, 84-member states voted in favour for the UN to accept the result, with 30 others abstaining. Due to Dutch efforts to promote a national identity, a significant number of Papuans refused to accept the territory's integration into Indonesia. These formed the separatist Free Papua Movement (OPM) and have waged an insurgency against Indonesia, which still continues to this day.

Biography Potts was born on 2 March 1839 in Bury, Lancashire. He moved to Oldham and designed many of the town's Cotton mills and was ranked with P. S. Stott as the greatest mill architect of Victorian Lancashire. Potts and his partnerships were responsible for the design and build of 200 mills, sixteen of which were in Oldham. One such mill is Textile Mill, Chadderton built in 1882. Mills of this period were constructed with fireproof floors. These were principally triple brick arches, but Potts pioneered the use of 7\\" thick concrete floors. On 3 March 1884 he attempted to patent this new method of constructing fireproof floors and ceilings. The patent was rejected, and it was rapidly adopted by other architects. The seven inch floor was more rigid than a 12\\" brick floor, so preserved the alignment of the spinning mules, thus saving power. However the concrete floor however required a closer grouping of supporting columns, which restricted the size of the machines. To solve this, he introduced transverse steel girders into the design, supported on steel lintels above the windows. Thus there was no lateral thrust on the walls, and the windows became square headed and abnormally wide. Potts moved to Eccles in 1891 and was responsible for the design of the town's library. He was a Liberal member of Eccles borough council from 1902 to 1905, the first chairman of the town's library committee in 1904 and a Justice of the Peace in 1906. He inaugurated popular Saturday night concerts during the winter months, and, keen to reduce the incidence of infant mortality, gave a sovereign to the mother of every child who reached the age of one. He died on 15 April 1909 and was buried at Chadderton Cemetery.

Levitt, 493 U.S. 455 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case. in which the Court held that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction to decide civil claims brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Background RICO is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. Following its enactment in 1970, there had been a disagreement in federal and state court decisions as to whether state courts had jurisdiction to decide claims filed under this federal statute. In 1962 Maryland established a quasi-public non- profit corporation, the Maryland Savings-Share Insurance Corporation (MSSIC), to insure accounts held in state chartered savings and loan associations. In May 1985, rumors of financial instability in two thrifts, Old Court Savings and Loans and Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan, led to depositors questioning whether MSSIC was financially able to guarantee all of the deposits, resulting in a run on all state savings and loan associations. This led to the withdrawal of deposits, the failure of Old Court and the subsequent collapse of MSSIC. The Maryland General Assembly during special sessions in 1985 established the Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund (MDIF) to replace the MSSIC. Nonresident holders of certificates of deposit issued by Old Court in federal district court sued Jeffrey Levitt, the former president of Old Court, the other officers and directors of Old Court and of the MSSIC, Old Court's law and accounting firms, and MDIF, asserting various state law causes of action and claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and RICO. The district court determined that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Securities Exchange Act, and, since the state courts had concurrent jurisdiction over the RICO claim, ruled that federal abstention over the case was appropriate for the remaining state and RICO claims. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed and also held that certificates of deposit were not \\"securities\\" under the Securities Exchange Act. The Supreme Court granted certiorari limited to the legal question of whether state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over RICO claims. Opinion of the Court In a unanimous opinion written by Justice O'Connor, the Supreme Court noted that under the dual American system of state and federal sovereignty, state courts have inherent authority to adjudicate claims under federal law subject only to the limits of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus, state courts are presumed under the Court's Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp. decision to have concurrent jurisdiction over a claim under federal law unless there is a provision in the statute expressly or implicitly limiting jurisdiction to federal courts. There was nothing in the RICO statute explicitly or implicitly preventing state courts from considering civil RICO claims. Justice White issued a concurring opinion stating that any concern that the concurrent authority of state courts to decide RICO claims would lead to disruptive constructions of federal criminal statutes was not dispositive since state criminal law is similar to federal criminal law. In addition, any incorrect state decisions could be corrected by the Supreme Court. Justice Scalia wrote a concurring opinion to address dicta from the Gulf Offshore case that had been included in the Tafflin majority opinion that suggested that implications from legislative history could be used to imply that state courts lacked concurrent jurisdiction over federal claims. His view was that Congress must make an affirmative clear statement in the statutory text to deprive a state court of jurisdiction of claims for that federal statute. Impact Although federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction of cases involving violations of the Securities Exchange Act, Tafflin allows plaintiffs to bring a RICO claim in state court and include concurrent claims from a Securities Exchange Act predicate violation, including Section 10(b) securities fraud claims. This overlapping jurisdiction is consistent with the remedial purposes of the Securities Exchange Act. The inclusion of a RICO claim in these securities fraud actions allows a plaintiff to receive punitive and treble damages as well as the recovery of attorney's fees, types of damages which are rarely allowed in pure securities fraud cases.

It is found in eastern Albania and western North Macedonia, with smaller populations in Kosovo and Montenegro. It is considered a national symbol in the Republic of North Macedonia and appears on the Macedonian five denar coin. It is believed that in North Macedonia there are from 35 to 40 remaining Balkan lynx, mostly found in Mavrovo National Park. This cat is considered to be the largest cat in the Balkans. It has been sighted in 2011 and 2012 in the northern mountainous region of Albania and within the boundaries of the Shebenik-Jabllanice National Park. It is classified as Critically Endangered in Albania and has been protected de jure since 1969 but, despite this, illegal poaching and habitat destruction threatens the remaining Balkan lynx populations in both Albania and North Macedonia. There are an estimated 15-20 individuals still alive in Albania. The Balkan lynx has been on the brink of extinction for nearly a century, with total numbers estimated to be fewer than 50. The Balkan lynxes' decrease in number have been thought to be due to illegal poaching. The Balkan lynx starts mating around January to February, and gives birth in April. While the Balkan lynx is listed as a subspecies in much of the news coverage and taxonomic references, there has been some dispute over those claims.  Habitat and population  The Balkan lynx is found in south-west Balkans, Albania, North Macedonia, and potentially Kosovo, Montenegro, and Greece. This is home to a critically endangered population of the Balkan lynx, with an estimated population of 30 adult individuals over 5000 km2. They have been recovering since the 1935-1940 where only 15-20 lynxes were estimated to be alive. They seemed to recover after WWII but the population has dwindled since 1974, when it was estimated at 280 lynxes, down to 90 lynxes in 2000. They live in deciduous forests, evergreen forests, mixed forests, and bush habitats. They do not migrate but occasionally hunt in shrub lands, cultivated areas, and high-mountain pastures during the summer. They primarily hunt roe deer, chamois, and brown hare. The Balkan lynx is categorized as critically endangered because of their low population. They are split into two sub-populations in Mavrovo National Park and in North Macedonia .  Mating  Mating season is from February to mid- April. Oestrus lasts for three days. Male and female often feed together during this time. Females are thought to give birth usually late May/early June. Litters can be anywhere from one to five kittens, with an average of two to three kittens. A newborn lynx weighs about 300 grams. At three months, kittens begin following the mother out of the rock cave den to eat meat from her kills. At ten months, usually around March or April, kittens leave their mothers to be independent.  Behavior  Lynx live mostly independent lives except for mating and raising cubs. Lynxes occupy territories marked with special gland secretions, urine, or feces. Males have larger territories to have access to one or two females. Males are thought to have territories around . Females are thought to have territories around . Mothers and daughters sometimes have greatly overlapping territories. Lynx are active during the evening and night and sleep during the day. The Lynx genus usually hunts lagomorphs, or hares and rabbits. However, the Eurasian lynx also hunts small ungulates, or deer such as roe deer, chamois, or musk deer. Although the lynx is known to have killed up to 30% of the roe deer population in northern Europe, they are not usually considered a threat to livestock. However, in Norway, lynxes have killed increasing numbers of sheep, up to 10,000 between 1996 and 2001.  Threats to the Balkan lynx  The most serious threats to the Balkan lynx are the low population size, habitat degradation, and poaching. Poaching affects the Balkan lynxes both directly and indirectly. Hunters that hunt the small wildlife and game indirectly harm the Balkan lynxes by restricting their source of food, such as roe deer, chamois, and hares. It is illegal to hunt Balkan lynxes but there has been evidence that there is a market for Balkan lynx fur. Also, some stuffed lynxes are seen as decorations in some restaurants in the countryside of Albania and North Macedonia. Tourists resorts and recreational activities have little to no effects on the population, whereas sport hunting and ski resorts can disturb the population within the national parks, where the majority of the Balkan lynxes habitat. The degradation of habitat is primarily in Albania, where logging has taken its toll on the environment and negatively affects the Balkan lynx. Albania's forests have been recovering from over exploitation since the 1800s. Although it is illegal to continue logging in the protected Balkan lynx habitat, it is still done and can potentially destroy the only habitat the Balkan lynx has. Because they have such low population density, it is difficult for mature adults to mate with each other. The population is separated into two different sub-populations in Albania and North Macedonia, further hindering the mating process, although both populations were confirmed to be stabilized by the Balkan Lynx Recovery Programme. There is a slight worry with the expansion of the native Carpathian and reintroduced Dinaric lynx population that may threaten the genetic integrity of the Balkan lynx population. Public attitudes towards the Balkan lynx were also gauged through social science studies, indicating that they are mostly positive, although not very well known and have many misconceptions about its size, behavior, and ecology.  Conservation  The Balkan lynx is considered a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is the highest risk category for endangered species. The Balkan lynx is also protected under the Convention for International Trade of Endangered Species (CITIES) by Appendix II, the Bern Convention by Appendix III, the EU Habitats and Species Directive by Annexes II and IV, as well as all range countries. A three-year program called the Balkan Lynx Recovery Programme (BLRP) was started in 2006 to combine the protection for lynxes and their habitats in Albania and North Macedonia. Sponsored by the Swiss-based MAVA Foundation, the goals of the program was to survey and monitor the lynx population, gathering data of their distribution, population tendencies, habitation, develop Conservation Strategy and National Action Plans across the range of the Balkan lynx, lobby for the Balkan lynx in protected areas in the European Green Belt, and build professional partnerships with relevant stakeholders in nature protection. The Balkan lynx was chosen as their figurehead and umbrella species. At the same time, a Human Dimension project was started in both Albania and North Macedonia, funded by the Research Council of Norway. The purpose of the project was to explore the human-large carnivore relationship, possible conflicts, the attitudes of the local people, and the challenges of cross border cooperation in large carnivore conservation. The second phase of the Balkan Lynx Recovery Programme was put into place in 2010 continuing the work done since 2006. This time, they delved deeper and began a scientific study on the Balkan lynx, supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. During this time, three male lynxes were caught and tagged with GPS collars and an intensive monitoring system was put into place at the core area of habitation, as well as a network monitoring wildlife. This project lasted from 2010 to 2012. The third phase of the BLRP began in 2013 to 2016 and focuses on raising awareness of the critical state of the Balkan lynx in primary schools locally, nationally, and internationally. They also continue the work on monitoring the core area of habitation of the Balkan lynx as well as expanding the project to combine research in both countries of North Macedonia and Albania.

The station consists of two side platforms, located on opposite sides of Harvard Avenue, which serve the B branch's two tracks. The station is fully accessible. History Reconstruction work in April 2002 Harvard Avenue is the second-busiest surface stop on the Green Line surface branches (behind only Coolidge Corner), with an average of 4,077 boardings on weekdays. The high ridership is because the station is the primary rapid transit connection for much of Allston as well as the eastern portion of Brighton. Additionally, it is a major bus transfer station for the busy route 66 bus, a crosstown trunk route which also serves as a feeder route connecting Allston and Brookline to the subway system. Due to its high ridership, Harvard Avenue was one of the first Green Line surface stops to be made accessible. In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility. Portable lifts were installed at Harvard Avenue around 2000 as a temporary measure. The platform modifications - part of a $32 million modification of thirteen B, C, and E branch stations - began in November 2001, with completion of the project in October 2002. Delays in construction caused cascading delays to similar renovations at Boston University East and Boston University Central.

The canal was intended to transport water from the Amu Darya river to Krasnovodsk (now T√ºrkmenba≈üy), a city in Turkmenistan on the coast of the Caspian Sea. The canal was going to use the course of the ancient dry Uzboy River bed. Map of Turkmenistan  History  The building of canals and channels for irrigation in Turkmenistan began in the 1930s. In 1929, the Bassaga-Kerkinskiy Canal was completed at a length of 100 km. The development of the outlet design for the Amu Darya began in 1932. The design was to bring water from the Amu Darya across Turkmenistan to the coast of the Caspian Sea to irrigate the Karakum Desert. The project was supported by Hydrologist V. Tsinzerling, who estimated the volume of water taken from the river to be around 17-35 cu km, which, according to estimations, should not have injured the economy of Uzbekistan or the ecology of the Aral Sea. It was intended to fill Sarykamysskoe Lake and to take from 30 to 50 cubic kilometers per year for 4 to 8 years. This version was approved by the State Planning Committee of the USSR in 1932. The second plan was chosen. The length of the canal was to be more than 1200 kilometers, beginning from Takhiatash, a town/city in Uzbekistan, then extended 10 km from the town of Nukus to Krasnovodsk on the Caspian Coast of Turkmenistan. However, the discharge of water into the Caspian Sea was not planned.  Plan  A system of weirs, sluices, reservoirs, hydroelectric power plants, diverters and conduits, over 1000 kilometers long was planned along the canal's route. At the beginning of the canal at Takhiatash, Uzbekistan an enormous weir was built which had to be combined with the hydroelectric power plant. 25 percent of the water from the Amu Darya was to be drained into the canal to drain the Aral Sea. With the level of the Aral Sea lowered, the intention was to use the exposed land for agriculture, but the salt of the lower reaches of the Amu Darya river had to be lowered according to calculations. The purpose of the canal was cotton growing, mastery of the new earth in the Karakum Desert, and later, navigation from the Volga River to the Amu Darya. The use of ten thousand dump trucks, bulldozers and excavators was anticipated for construction. The width of the canal was to be more than 100 meters, and a depth of 6‚Äì7 meters. There was another projected 10,000 kilometers of main and distribution canals, 2,000 reservoirs and three hydroelectric plants, each producing 100,000 kilowatts. Construction was intended to be finished by 1957.  Construction  Building began after the decision of the Council of Ministers in September 1950. The construction was based in Urgench (at that time part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic). Urgench was chosen for its rail access. In November 1950, construction workers started work at the building site of the camps that would hold 2000 people. In December, they laid the new city of Takhiatash on the Amu Darya's west side. When the city was first constructed there were two camps beginning to be built in the city for 1500 prisoners or people. Shipments of goods from the entire country entered Takhiatash, and according to recollections, were stored poorly, and substantial portions were considered unusable. In 1951, several camps and economic objects were built. On June 15, 1952 the railroad from Takhiatash to Chardzhou (now, T√ºrkmenabat) was opened. Infrastructure for the development of the city was created, searching expeditions were organized and aviation was connected. The number of workers during construction is estimated at 10,000; more than half were prisoners.  Abandonment  After Stalin's death in 1953, construction of the Main Turkmen Canal ceased. In 1954 construction of the Qaraqum Canal began, along a route far to the south. It stretches 1300 km and irrigates a substantial part of Turkmenistan, and remains the most important canal in Turkmenistan. Construction of Qaraqum Canal drained the Amu Darya river and therefore enabled huge areas to be opened for cotton production. Nevertheless, it also resulted in the destruction of the native riparian tugay forests, and greatly diminished the inflow of water to the Aral Sea, which caused great ecological catastrophe.

She is best known for an act of pique by Commander Warwick Lake, who marooned a seaman, and for an inconclusive but hard-fought ship action under Commander Charles John Napier against the French corvette . She captured a number of American vessels as prizes during the War of 1812 before being laid up in 1815 and sold for breaking up in 1822. Napoleonic Wars Recruit was ordered on 27 January 1806 from the shipwright Andrew Hills, of Sandwich, Kent. She was laid down in April 1806 and launched on 31 August 1806. =The marooning of Seaman Jeffery= Recruit was commissioned under Commander George Ackholm in March 1807. On 28 August, detained the Danish ships Diamond and Karen Louisa. Recruit, , , and were in sight and shared in the proceeds of the seizure. Next, Recruit sailed to the Caribbean under Commander Warwick Lake, supposedly in July, but clearly later. During the voyage, a young sailor named Robert Jeffery was discovered to have stolen the midshipmen's beer and Lake furiously ordered him to be marooned on the island of Sombrero. (Jeffery had been born at Fowey but moved to Polperro before becoming a merchant seaman and was then pressed into the navy.) Some months later, Lake's commanding officer Sir Alexander Cochrane discovered what had happened and immediately ordered Lake to retrieve Jeffery. When Recruit arrived at Sombrero, Jeffery could not be found. Eventually the story got out and a court martial dismissed Lake from the service for his actions. As it turned out, Jeffery had been picked up by an American ship and was eventually discovered in Massachusetts three years later, working as a blacksmith. He returned to Britain aboard and received compensation.To gather evidence for the court martial, the Admiralty had sent and Recruits sister ship, , to ascertain the survival prospects for someone landed at the island without food and water. The two ships reported back that the prospects for survival were poor. =Captain Charles Napier= Command passed to Commander Charles Napier, who led Recruit into action against the French corvette , under Jean-Fran√ßois Lemaresquier, on 6 September 1808. The action was fierce and resulted in Recruit losing her mainmast and suffering heavy casualties, including Napier, whose leg was broken by a cannon shot. Diligente was only driven off after a lucky shot from Recruit ignited an ammunition store. Recruit lost six killed and 23 wounded, half of them mortally, out of a crew of 106. Following repairs, Recruit participated in the invasion of Martinique in January 1809. Napier observed that Fort Edward at Fort Royal Bay appeared abandoned. He took a gig and with four men, landed, scaled the fort's walls, and hoisted a British flag. Sir Alexander Cochrane immediately landed marines to occupy the fort and turn its mortars, which had not been spiked, against the French. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Martinique\\" to all survivors of the campaign. Shortly thereafter, Napier received promotion to Post-captain and appointment to command of , but remained with Recruit for a few more months. In April 1809, a strong French squadron arrived at the √éles des Saintes, south of Guadeloupe. There they were blockaded until 14 April, when a British force under Major-General Frederick Maitland and Captain Philip Beaver in , invaded and captured the islands. Recruit was among the naval vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the islands. The intrepid behaviour of Captain Charles Napier taking D'Hautpoult in 1809 I April Recruit participated in the defeat of a French reinforcement squadron. During the engagement, Napier was instrumental in maintaining contact with the French force, harrying their flagship continuously at some great risk to Recruit that only Napier's skillful ship handling mitigated. Recruit was present at the surrender of D'Hautpoult and Napier was temporarily appointed to command the captured ship of the line, but then transferred to Jason and sailed her back to Britain. However, on his arrival the Admiralty confirmed his rank but not his appointment, and he was put on half-pay. Jasons new captain was Captain King, who had been Napier's passenger on Jason. Napier protested to the Admiralty that had he not stayed on Recruit and contributed to the capture of D'Hautpoult he would have received a command, but to no avail. In June 1809 command of Recruit transferred to Commander James Murray, and then in May 1810 Commander John Cookesley replaced Murray. War of 1812 In December 1810 Commander Humphrey Fleming Senhouse took command and later sailed Recruit back to Britain. In 1811, Recruit was at Spithead. She sailed for North America on 9 November 1811. She was at Halifax, Nova Scotia at the outbreak of the War of 1812. When captured Romney on 22 September 1812, and Santa Maria on 28 September, Recruit shared the prize money by agreement. In 1813, Recruit was trapped in ice off Cape Breton where over half her complement were taken ill with sicknesses related to a lack of fresh vegetables.Marshall (1830), p.423. When Lieutenant George Pechell (acting commander) took command of Recruit for his first cruise that summer, she had only half her normal crew. On 18 July Recruit re-captured the ship Lavinia, T. Connell, master.Vice-Admiralty Court, Halifax (1911), p.133. Lavinia had been sailing from Saint Johns, Newfoundland, to Oporto when the privateer Yorktown had captured her. Then on 20 August Recruit recaptured the brig King George, J.Thompson, master. When she was captured, King George, a brig of 204 tons (bm), had been carrying salt from Liverpool.Vice-Admiralty Court, Halifax (1911), p.132. On 2 November, Recruit and drove the letter of marque schooner Inca on the shoals at Cape Romain. Inca was armed with six 12-pounder carronades and carried a crew of 35 men.

Premaratne and starring Malani Fonseka and Amarasiri Kalansuriya. Plot Niranjala (Malini Fonseka), a member of the English speaking elite, and Nimal (Amarasiri Kalansooriya), a young university graduate, regularly meet at the gas station where he works. They are attracted to each other, and over time, start meeting outside of the station's confines. One of these occasions occurs at Niranjala's university fair. Nimal comes to meet her, but during the fair, one of Niranjala's friends is attacked by a gang of men. Nimal and his close friend Pradeep (Robin Fernando) help the friend get out of trouble. Later, when Nimal returns to the gas station, this gang of men come after him, and the fighting leads to the gas station owner firing Nimal. Niranjala heads back to her family's tea estate in the hill country after she finishes university. Her father informs her that she will meet Samson (Ranjan Mendis), the son of an old friend and the new estate manager. Samson was educated in the UK and is returning to Sri Lanka. Samson exits the airport only to see a poster for a singer named Erine. He watches her perform and when he meets her, it is revealed that they had a relationship in the UK. Samson and Erine spend time together in Colombo and Samson decides to skirt on his promised responsibilities, while Nimal tries to come up with a way to reunite with Niranjala. Meneka (Geetha Kumarasinghe), Niranjala's close friend, and Pradeep scheme for respectable ways for them to get back together. Instead, Nimal finds the letter of invitation in Samson's pocket and uses it to pass for him in the tea country. Nimal arrives in the tea country and seamlessly convinces Niranjala's father that he is Samson. Nimal learns about tea estate life and as the new estate manager, earns the respect of the estate workers. Samson's father arrives in Sri Lanka, and realizing that Samson has not moved to the hill country, drags him there, unannounced. Niranjala's father realizes what has happened and kicks Nimal out and forces Niranjala into the arranged marriage between her and Samson. A break-in occurs at the estate, and although no one can find the missing items, the blame falls on Nimal. This ensure his imprisonment until after the wedding. On the day of the wedding, Nimal escapes and drives off with Niranjala. It comes out to everyone that Samson stole the items, gave some to Erine, and Nimal and Pradeep proceed to beat him up. The movie ends with Niranjala and Nimal running towards each other.

She refuses and instead of continuing on his way, he insults her. Later, Niranjala and Meneka get into their car, and the young man drives up to them. He is rude and harasses Meneka through the car window. Their driver asks, \\"Isn't that the son of someone important?\\" to which Niranjala replies, \\"It doesn't matter; he wasn't raised well.\\" Nimal has a degree from a Sri Lankan university, yet with the high unemployment rate in the late 1970s, the only job he can attain is that of a gas attendant. When he is unemployed, he fears that other people will assume he is part of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Niranjala's social identity as part of the English speaking elite is pointed at this socio-political situation.

He graduated as a chemical engineer from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1936 and earned the dr.philos. degree in 1942. He was briefly a teacher at Trondheim Commerce School before working as an assistant at the Norwegian Institute of Technology from 1939. Wergeland worked as a professor of physics from 1946 to 1979 at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, now the Norwegian University of Science and Technology at Gl√∏shaugen. He also served as associate professor at Purdue University from 1948 to 1949. Wergeland participated in the foundation of CERN and was a leading member of Pugwash in Norway.

He is the Member of House of Assembly for Bulilima West (MDC-M).  Biography  He was born 1956 or 1957 in Bulilima District (also known as Plumtree) near Zimbabwe's border with Botswana. Mzila, as he is affectionately known, grew up in Thekwane village until he graduated as a teacher at Gwelo (now Gweru) Teacher's College (GTC). While at GTC Mzila became active in the youth league of Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) (led by Joshua Nkomo). After graduating, Mzila relocated to Bulawayo where he taught in several schools including Sobukhazi High School. = At the battle front = It is when he was at Sobukhazi that Mzila decided to cross the border and join the war front. He attended military training in the Soviet Union, Cuba and Angola before returning to the battle front as a Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary (ZIPRA) platoon commander operating along the Zambia-Zimbabwe boundaries.  Demobilization and civilian life  At the end of the war in 1980, disappointed that ZANU and not ZAPU had assumed control, Mzila came back into the country, demobilised from the army and re- assumed civilian life. During operation Gukurahundi, Mzila was a teacher in rural Matebeleland mainly Fatima, Regina Mundi and St Paul's all in Lupane District. As a known ex-ZIPRA his life was in constant danger but as an ex- guerilla he knew how best to outsmart a conventional army. It is during these times that he developed an even stronger bond with rural peasants as he saw them being victimised on grounds of conscience and many a times ethnicity. Later, Mzila furthered his education and became a college lecturer. He lectured at Hillside Teacher's College, Gwanda ZINTEC (now Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Polytechnic) and United College of Education (UCE). Moses Mzila taught Sociology of Education at UCE and he was regarded by most students as the best lecturer. He was full of charisma and his lectures were interesting. It was during his time as a college lecturer that he helped reform and strengthen the College Lecturers Association of Zimbabwe (COLAZ). COLAZ became an affiliate of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) which was very influential to the formation of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in 1999. = The 2000 elections = Mzila became part of a group of civil servants who braved the government and openly organised for the opposition. ‚ÄúOnce a meeting was organized for us to meet students and lecturers at U.C.E, I went there together with others and we found the hall filled to capacity. We sat at the high table and waited for our hosts to introduce us. Long after order and calm was established, in came this visibly young man‚Ä¶.. slim and tall. Suddenly the whole hall was alarmed and charmed and everyone went electric. He started a song to which everyone danced. At the end of the meeting he introduced himself to us. I later went to the office and the met the Vice President (the late Gibson Sibanda) and I said to him 'I met a young man at U.C.E and he strikes me as someone who can help us win seats and I understand he has been doing work also in Plumtree. All you have to do is organize as many meetings for him and I am sure he will sing himself into Parliament'. At that time l did not know the intellectual side of him which even shocked me when I learnt of it\\", narrates Professor Welshman Ncube (now MDC President and Government Minister). Accordingly, Mzila contested the then Bulilimamangwe South Parliamentary seat in the February 2000 elections on an MDC ticket and won. He has retained that seat up to this date. = Party leadership = Mzila was to become an influential figure within the then united MDC. He was elected chairman for his home province of Matebeleland South, a position that made him a member of the party's National Executive Committee and National Council. His name soon became a brand of mass mobilisation to the extent that under his leadership, his party, both before and after the split, has always attained majority seats in his province. His trademark song 'Guerilla ilanga litshonile solalaphi' and Fidel Castro dress code soon became symbols of resistance and victory against state oppression in the Matebeleland South. At National level Mzila was appointed Secretary for International Relations in the party. This position however set him in various occasional clashes with Presidential Advisor on International Relations the late Professor Eliphas Mukonoweshuro. As early as 2004, intraparty violence showed up in the MDC. Legislators like Edwin Mushoriwa (now MDC Deputy President) and Priscilla Misihairabwi-Mushonga (now MDC Secretary General and Government Minister) and other national leaders like Frank Chamunorwa (now MDC vice-chairman) and Shupikai Mandaza were all attacked by armed party youths. A commission of inquiry composed of Advocate H. Zhou, the late Senator Enna Chitsa and Mzila among others was appointed to investigate the causes and extent of the conflict. Renowned party activists like the late George Kawuzani, Bertha Chokururama and Tonderai Ndira among others were hauled before the Zhou Commission. Written, video and audio recordings were made and submitted to the united MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai (now Prime Minister of Zimbabwe). ‚ÄúAfter going through our findings Tsvangirai called and said \\"you deserve my respect. These kinds of confessions are what the CIO (Central Intelligence Organization) is looking for and had they put their hands on this you would have never been broke in your life\\", says Mzila explaining the integrity and secrecy with which they conducted the commission. \\"I however do not understand why he disregarded our recommendations\\", he adds. After the infamous 12 October 2005 MDC split Mzila went with the 'pro-Senate' group where he retained both positions of Matebeleland South Provincial chairman and National Secretary for International Relations. He held these two positions until January 2011 where Congress elected him to the powerful post of Deputy Secretary General. = Advocacy work = In the whole of Zimbabwe, Mzila has become the natural face of the fight for truth, justice and reconciliation for the victims and perpetrators of Gukurahundi atrocities. This, he has achieved through coining consistent and persistent messages that have become a hallmark of his addresses be it in rallies, funerals, church functions, public meetings and even Parliament. His consistency has won him invitations to speak in various platforms in and outside Zimbabwe on one hand, while on the other subjecting him to attacks by political opponents and series of traps by the state ultimately leading to his arrest on 16 April 2011 in Lupane. It is also, inarguably, his consistency that made him natural successor to the late Gibson Sibanda as Minister of State in the Organ for National, Healing, Reconciliation and Integration (ONHRI). = Government work = On 25 February 2009, Mzila was sworn in as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was to become Deputy to ZANU PF's Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, a man he would later describe as 'a terrible work mate'. By then Mzila still held the position of International Relations Secretary in his party and his appointment as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs would have been a great match had he not been with his 'terrible workmate'. He however tried his best to create socio-cultural ties between rural Zimbabwean artists and Africa leading to Mokis Connection's (a rural Bulilima musical group) visit to Algeria. After the death of Gibson Sibanda in August 2010, Mzila succeeded him as Minister of State in the Organ for National, Healing, Reconciliation and Integration. In other quasi- government bodies, Mzila serves as one of the six negotiators to the Global Political Agreement and a member of the management committee of the Committee of Parliament of the new Constitution (COPAC). = Arrests, harassments and detentions = On 16 April 2011, while driving to address a public meeting in Victoria Falls at the invitation of Uluntu Ciisi Trust, just after passing the grounds where Lupane Government complex is pegged he was stopped by a police road block. The junior officers advised him that their superiors at the camp had sent for him and he should pass by. The ex-combatant would then celebrate the country's 31st Independence and other weeks to follow behind bars and in a heavy search for justice. He was summarily accused of contravening the notorious Criminal Law (Codification) and Reform Act by attending a church prayer meeting at Silwane Primary School in Lupane and encouraging attendants to speak openly about their grievances. However the greatest and real crime is his leadership style. Soon after his appointment in October 2010, Mzila introduced a new people-centered approach to the task of ONHRI. He began to attend civic society meetings and church gatherings in rural areas encouraging victims of atrocities to speak openly about their problems and prescribe solutions thereof. This irked the state and a plethora of plots against him were made. These included denying him fuel to travel from Harare to Matebeleland, breaking into his office, his arrest on 16 April 2011, subsequent harassment and humiliation and draconian bail conditions which he later appealed against and won. Mzila is no stranger to arrests and detentions. Prior to the 16 April arrest he had served a six-month sentence at the notorious Khami Maximum Prison. This sentence came in 2003 during the state's clamp down on MDC leaders accusing them of violence, treason, arson and other crimes. ‚ÄúI found myself in a small prison cell full of young people in their twenties and they looked at me with faces that I read to be saying 'what is this grey haired man looking for here?'. Others were however quick to notice who I was and we spent several nights singing songs of freedom. Oppressive and unforgettable as it was, this is an experience that rejuvenated my fighting spirit\\", he explains. While on bail following the 16 April arrest, Mzila was briefly detained together with Prof. Ncube, Misihairabwi-Mushonga, Paul Themba Nyathi, Youth Secretary General Discent Collins Bajila and sixteen other MDC leaders after attending a house meeting in Victoria Falls.

Early life Martha Parke Custis was born on December 31, 1777 in the Blue Room at Mount Vernon. She was the second-eldest surviving daughter of John Parke Custis, son of Martha Washington and her first husband Daniel Parke Custis, and his wife Eleanor Calvert, daughter of Benedict Swingate Calvert and his wife Elizabeth Calvert. Martha was named for her father's late sister, Martha \\"Patsy\\" Parke Custis (1756‚Äì1773). Her siblings included Elizabeth Parke Custis Law (1776‚Äì1831), Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis (1779‚Äì1854), and George Washington Parke Custis (1781‚Äì1857). She was known to her family as \\"Patsy.\\" At first the family alternated between living at the Washingtons' plantation, Mount Vernon in Virginia, and the Calverts' plantation, Mount Airy in Maryland. In 1778, John Parke Custis purchased Abingdon, a plantation on the west bank of the Potomac River (now the site of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport). Abingdon was conveniently located equidistant between Mount Vernon and Mount Airy. Marriage and children Martha married Thomas Peter in 1795 at Hope Park in Fairfax County, Virginia. The young bride requested from her step-grandfather George Washington a miniature of himself as a wedding gift. Painted in Philadelphia between 1794 and 1795 by Walter Robertson, the miniature was a watercolor on ivory and is set in gold, and depicted Washington in his Continental Army uniform. Martha and Thomas had eight children. *Martha Eliza Eleanor Peter (January 20, 1796 ‚Äì August 31, 1800) *Columbia Washington Peter (December 2, 1797 ‚Äì December 3, 1820) *John Parke Custis Peter (November 14, 1799 ‚Äì January 19, 1848), married Elizabeth Jane Henderson *George Washington Parke Custis Peter (November 18, 1801 ‚Äì December 10, 1877, married Jane Boyce *America Pinckney Peter WilliamsAssembly, Volume 28 (October 12, 1803 ‚Äì April 25, 1842), married William George Williams *Robert Thomas Peter (November 7, 1806 ‚Äì October 5, 1807) *Martha Custis Castania Peter (October 5, 1808 ‚Äì April 5, 1809) *Britannia Wellington Peter Kennon (January 28, 1815 ‚Äì January 27, 1911), married Beverley Kennon (1793‚Äì1844) Slaves and inheritances Upon her marriage, Martha inherited 61 slaves from her late father's estate. Thomas almost immediately auctioned them off to raise cash, an action that may have inspired the stern rebuke against the breaking up of slave families that George Washington delivered in his will. Her step-grandfather bequeathed her $8,000, 1/32 of his estate. Martha Washington died in 1802, and Thomas Peter served as executor of her estate. The Peters purchased at a private sale many objects from Mount Vernon to preserve her grandparents' legacy. Martha Peter inherited approximately 35 dower slaves from Mount Vernon following her grandmother's death (from grandfather Daniel Parke Custis's estate). She later inherited about 40 additional slaves following the 1811 death of her mother (from father John Parke Custis's estate).As widow of an intestate husband, Eleanor Calvert Custis (later Stuart) was granted the lifetime use of 1/3 of the assets of John Parke Custis's estate, including its slaves. Upon her death, her third of the Custis estate, including its slaves, was inherited by the couple's 4 children.

It was the first of the February 2009 Cairo terrorist attacks. Attack details The attack took place just after dark in front of a cafe crowded with people gathering to watch a televised football match. There were conflicting reports that the bomb was thrown from a balcony or from a motorcycle, but security officials reported that the bomb had exploded under a bench in a garden in the square. A second bomb failed to detonate and was defused. The bombs weighed and contained nails and metal fragments. A 17-year- old French girl, who was among a group of 54 teenagers from Levallois-Perret near Paris, was killed. Seventeen French, one German and three Saudi tourists, as well as three Egyptians, were wounded. Early reports suggest the explosive devices were \\"primitive\\". Responsibility According to security sources, there was no immediate claim of responsibility by any militant group, but three suspects had been taken into custody. Reactions Then French President Nicolas Sarkozy and then Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon condemned the attacks. The attack has raised fear of the return of the Islamic militants groups to target Egypt's tourism industry. The attacks were also speculated to be linked to anger over Egypt's role in the Gaza conflict. The bombing caused concern for Cairo authorities, who saw the tourist industry devastated by bombings and shootings by Islamic militants in the 1990s.

Sports play a key role in the culture and makeup of Dominican Republic society. Baseball is the most popular sport on the island country and Major League Baseball has been recruiting players from the Dominican Republic since the 1960s. Association football is the second sport of the country. Baseball Baseball is the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic today.https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciajessop/2013/03/19/the-secrets-behind- the-dominican-republics-success-in-the-world-baseball-classic-and- mlb/#4b9efb96285f After the United States, the Dominican Republic has the second-highest number of baseball players in Major League Baseball (MLB). Juan Marichal AKA the \\"Dominican Dandy\\" Although the sport was first seen in Latin America in Cuba, baseball began to flourish in the Dominican Republic when the United States Marine Corps occupied the island from 1916-1924. The first players of the game in the Dominican Republic were the upper-class Dominican boys who studied in the United States and played the game of baseball when they returned to the Dominican Republic. In the early 1900s, there were two baseball clubs named Nuevo Club and Ozama that were head and shoulders above the competition. However, a group called Licey emerged and it would become one of the finest sporting institutions in the Dominican Republic. With the arrival of Licey in 1907 thousands of people showed up for their games with the other self-organized teams in the country. They became great entertainment for citizens from all economic backgrounds. In 1912, Nuevo Club won the first baseball championship in Santo Domingo. Between the years of 1907-1920, the sport of baseball was played in the Dominican Republic for fun and the players played for \\"the love of the game.\\" However, in 1921 the teams began to collect money from spectators and the championship game that year brought in over $7,000 and commercial pressures led to the sport becoming a semi-profession in the Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo became president of the Dominican Republic in 1930 and he helped baseball soar in popularity as the sport gained a political connection. By the end of the 1930s, many of the finest Negro League players from the United States and Cuban players played baseball in the summer in the Dominican Republic as they were paid a fortune in order to come play. Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball in 1947 and soon after teams from the MLB began sending scouts to watch Dominican Republic players play. Between 1955 and 1980 there were 49 players from the Dominican Republic who played in the MLB. However, in the 1980s hundreds of players started coming to the United States as there became \\"working relationships between North American and Dominican teams.\\" The first great pitcher from the Dominican Republic who starred in the United States was Juan Marichal who is nicknamed the \\"Dominican Dandy\\". He began his playing career in the MLB in 1960 after he was signed from the Dominican Republic by the San Francisco Giants. The first great hitter from the Dominican Republic was Felipe Alou who hit 206 career home runs. Free agency in the MLB, which began in 1976, and the rise of baseball academies in the Dominican Republic have changed Dominican Baseball. For years, owners of traditional Dominican teams have been underpaying their players, however since the salary of Major League Baseball players has gone up dramatically players who once played in the Dominican Winter Baseball League are no longer playing and instead, trying to sign contracts with teams from the MLB. Young Dominican ball players at Campo Las Palmas Historian Alan Klein wrote in his book Sugarball, \\"Nothing typifies the new direction of Dominican baseball as much as the baseball academy, an institution rooted in the increased presence and benevolent paternalism of North American baseball interests in the country.\\" The first baseball academy in the Dominican Republic was built in 1977 by Ralph Avila. In his description of baseball academies in the Dominican Republic, Alan Klein wrote \\"What the academy does in working with the Dominican players goes beyond teaching baseball skills. They teach career preparation, socialization and how to cope with the cultural changes they will face in the United States.\\" Campo Las Palmas is the best is the best-run academy on the island and it is owned by the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dominican Republic has its own baseball league, the Dominican Winter Baseball League, which runs its season from October to January. It comprises six teams: √Åguilas Cibae√±as (Cibao Eagles), Estrellas Orientales (Eastern Stars), Gigantes del Cibao (Cibao Giants), Leones del Escogido (Chosen Lions), Tigres del Licey (Licey Tigers), and Toros del Este (Eastern Bulls). The league started in 1956 when the Dominican League switched from playing in the summers to playing in the winters. Many MLB and minor league players play in the Dominican League during their own off-season. However, as of late the league has struggled financially as \\"more of the established native players sit out and too many of the reinforcements fail to last the season. Attendance is down and the country's economic crisis has intruded the parks.\\" The Dominican Republic has participated in the Baseball World Cup, winning one Gold (1949), three Silver (1942, 1950, 1952), and two Bronze (1943, 1969), placing it seventh, right after Puerto Rico's one Gold, four Silver, and four Bronze. (Cuba holds a record twenty-five Gold, two Silver and two Bronze.) The country also participated in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, the inaugural tournament, in which they finished semi‚Äìfinalists along with Korea. In the 2013 World Baseball Classic, the Dominican Republic became the first team to win the event undefeated. They beat Puerto Rico in the Championship game to win the 2013 World Baseball Classic. In 2017, The Dominican Republic participated in the World Baseball Classic and made it to the second round. However, a highlight from the 2017 World Baseball Classic was when the Dominican Republic played the United States and won 7 to 5 in front of a record 37,446 fans at Marlins Park in Miami, FL.

Although thousands of players from the island have played in the MLB, only 3 have been inducted into The National Baseball Hall of Fame. Those players are Juan Marichal, Vladimir Guerrero and Pedro Martinez. Although hundreds of Dominican players make their way to the United States to play professional baseball it has done little to improve relations between the two countries. Alan Klein wrote \\"No other country dominates the Dominican Republic as much as the United States does.\\" From 1870-1980, the United States made their presence felt on Dominican soil and it did nothing but continue to make matters worse for the average Dominican financially. The few wealthy families in the Dominican work hard to keep the interests of the United States in place so there is a revolving door that keeps the wealth in a select few families. In addition, American professional baseball has hurt Dominican professional baseball as most Dominicans who play in the MLB are not allowed to play in the Dominican League in the winter. Basketball The Dominican Republic has had a quite successful national team which e.g. advanced to the second stage at the 2019 Basketball World Cup after they surprisingly eliminated Germany 70-68. The National Federation of Basketball holds every year a professional league, the National Basketball League, LNB (Spanish: \\"Liga Nacional de Baloncesto\\"). The National Basketball Association (NBA) have some players who represent the Dominican Republic, such as: *Francisco Garc√≠a, guard‚Äìforward for the Sacramento Kings; first round pick in the 2005 NBA Draft *Al Horford, power forward, third overall pick by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2007 NBA Draft *Karl-Anthony Towns, center, first overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2015 NBA Draft. *√Ångel Delgado, center for the Los Angeles Clippers, went undrafted in the 2018 NBA Draft. The country hosted 2005 FIBA Americas Championship. Boxing Boxing is an important sport, and the country has produced scores of world-class fighters and world champions, both professionals and amateurs, among them Carlos Teo Cruz, Leo Cruz, Julio C√©sar Green, Joan Guzm√°n, and Juan Carlos Payano. Football Football is also a popular sport in the Dominican Republic. The governing body is the Federaci√≥n Dominicana de F√∫tbol. The Liga Dominicana de F√∫tbol is the top division of the Federaci√≥n Dominicana de F√∫tbol. There have been a couple of FIFA Goal Programme projects that have been designed to further improve the infrastructure and facilities in the country in recent years. Notable Dominican Footballers include Mariano D√≠az And Junior Firpo, who both play in La Liga, and Jonathan Fa√±a, who plays for Atl√©tico San Francisco And the Dominican Republic National Football Team. Volleyball Volleyball was introduced by U.S. marines in 1916. The first international competition came in 1934 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti with the Caribbean Volleyball Tournament. The most important goal for the women's team was winning the gold medal at the 2003 Panamerican Games. Starting from 2007, the Dominican Volleyball Federation holds the Dominican Volleyball League every year. It is a professional volleyball league with eight participating teams in both genders. As of 2014, The women's senior team is ranked 7th. in the FIVB ranking and the men's senior team is ranked 33rd. Many Dominicans play at international clubs in America, Europe and Asia, like Brenda Castillo, Bethania de la Cruz and Elvis Contreras. Olympics The first Olympic participation was in 1964 with just one athlete, Alberto Torres de la Mota (\\"El Gringo\\" ) in track & field (100 m). The first medallist was the boxer Pedro Julio Nolasco who won the bronze medal in the 1984 Olympic Games. The first gold medal, and second medal, came by the two-time world champion 400 m hurdles F√©lix S√°nchez in the 2004 Olympic Games. The recent and more successful Olympiad, Beijing 2008, boxer Manuel F√©lix D√≠az and the taekwondo practitioner Gabriel Mercedes won golden and silver medals respectively. The Dominican Republic Olympic Committee (DROC) is represented by its president Mr. Luis Mej√≠a Oviedo. Pan American Games The Dominican Republic hosted the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo. The United States finished with the most medals. The games featured 338 events in 35 sports. Central American and Caribbean Games Dominican Republic hosted two Central American and Caribbean Games, the editions of 1974 at Santo Domingo, and the 1986 at lshit. Other sports Luis Castillo, defensive end played in the National Football League for the San Diego Chargers. Castillo was the cover athlete for the Spanish language version of Madden NFL 08. Rugby union is a minor sport, but there is a Dominican Republic side, which has played at least one international. Other sports include combat sports of judo, and professional wrestlers Arcadio Brito, Jack Veneno and Bronco # 1. In 2014, Victor Estrella became the nation's first top 100 tennis player. Historical sports Though no longer played much, cricket was played to some extent by immigrants from the West Indies.

Many Paleogene crocodilians from Europe and Asia have been attributed to Asiatosuchus since the genus was named in 1940. These species have a generalized crocodilian morphology typified by flat, triangular skulls. The feature that traditionally united these species under the genus Asiatosuchus is a broad connection or symphysis between the two halves of the lower jaw. Recent studies of the evolutionary relationships of early crocodilians along with closer examinations of the morphology of fossil specimens suggest that only the first named species of Asiatosuchus, A. grangeri from the Eocene of Mongolia, belongs in the genus. Most species are now regarded as nomina dubia or \\"dubious names\\", meaning that their type specimens lack the unique anatomical features necessary to justify their classification as distinct species. Other species such as \\"A.\\" germanicus and \\"A.\\" depressifrons are still considered valid species, but they do not form an evolutionary grouping with A. grangeri that would warrant them being placed together in the genus Asiatosuchus. Description Like most other Paleogene crocodyloids, Asiatosuchus has a generalized crocodilian skull that is triangular in shape when viewed from above. Asiatosuchus species have teeth in the upper jaw that completely overlap the teeth in the lower jaw, giving them overbites. An overbite is a primitive feature among crocodyloids because modern crocodiles have teeth in the upper and lower jaws that interlock with each other with little overlap. Asiatosuchus can be distinguished from other early crocodyloids by its extended mandibular symphysis, the region where the two halves of the lower jaws connect. In many crocodyloids this joint is formed from two pairs of bones, the dentary bones and the splenial bones, but in Asiatosuchus it is only formed by the dentary bones. Based on largely complete skeletons of \\"A.\\" germanicus and \\"A. depressifrons, Asiatosuchus may have grown up to long. SpeciesA. grangeri= A. grangeri, the type species of Asiatosuchus, was named by paleontologist Charles Mook in 1940. It was named on the basis of a lower jaw and pieces of a skull from the Irdin Manha Formation of Inner Mongolia, China, which dates back to the Middle Eocene. These fossils were discovered by the American Museum of Natural History's Central Asiatic Expedition of 1930 near Erenhot. Mook named Asiatosuchus grangeri after Walter W. Granger, a vertebrate paleontologist with the American Museum of Natural History and a member of the expedition. Mook thought that Asiatosuchus grangeri was closely related to species of Crocodylus (modern crocodiles) but different in having 17 teeth in each half of the lower jaw and a splenial bone that does form part of the mandibular symphysis. =\\"A.\\" germanicus= \\"Asiatosuchus\\" germanicus skull \\"A.\\" germanicus hind leg and tail Well-preserved remains of a crocodyloid were first described from Germany and France in 1966 and placed in a new species of Asiatosuchus, A. germanicus. The German remains came from the Messel Pit quarry, a fossil site that has preserved many forms of life that inhabited a series of anoxic lakes and surrounding subtropical forests during the Eocene. Of all the species that have been assigned to Asiatosuchus, \\"A.\\" germanicus is known from the most complete material. =\\"A.\\" depressifrons= \\"A.\\" depressifrons skull \\"Asiatosuchus\\" depressifrons was first named in 1855 as Crocodilus depressifrons. The naming of this new species was based on a skull found in France that dates back to the Early Eocene. The skull was illustrated in the 1855 paper but it was not thoroughly described. The fossil has since become heavily pyritized, losing much of its original anatomical detail. After its naming, several other crocodilian fossils in European museum collections were labeled as C. depressifrons. The species name depressifrons refers to the flattened shape of the frontal bone in the skull, a feature that is shared by all fossils attributed to the species. The fossils are also similar in having 6 pairs of teeth lining the symphysis at the tip of the lower jaw. As was the case for many other Paleogene crocodyloids, \\"A.\\" depressifrons was originally placed in the still-living genus Crocodylus because the overall shape of its skull is similar to those of living crocodiles. Soon after Mook named Asiatosuchus grangeri, C. depressifrons was reassigned to Asiatosuchus. Many new and much more complete fossils of \\"A.\\" depressifrons have been found from Early Eocene deposits in Belgium. Together these specimens provide details on most of the skeleton. \\"A.\\" depressifrons can be distinguished from all other species of Asiatosuchus by a combination of several characteristics including a large hole and a depressed area on the jugal bone of the skull, a frontal bone that does not touch the supratemporal fenestrae (two holes at the top of the skull behind the eye sockets), and a postorbital bone behind the eye socket that is visible when the skull is viewed from the side. Another distinguishing feature of \\"A.\\" depressifrons is its lack of an overbite. =Other species= In 1964 Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian named a new species of Asiatosuchus, A. nanlingensis, from the Shanghu Formation in Nanxiong, Guangdong Province, China. Small coprolites (fossilized feces) were found alongside the type specimen of A. nanlingensis. Recent studies have found A. nanlingensis to be valid, although not clearly referable to Asiatosuchus.Wang Y, Sullivan C, Liu J.

Taxonomic reassessment and phylogenetic test of Asiatosuchus nanlingensis Young, 1964 and Eoalligator chunyii Young, 1964. Vertebrata PalAsiatica. in press Two species of Asiatosuchus were named from Russia, A. zajsanicus in 1982 and A. volgensis in 1993. A. volgensis and A. zajsanicus were regarded as nomina dubia by Angielczyk and Gingerich (1998) because they are based on fossil specimens that preserve very little anatomical detail. A. zajsanicus was later reassigned to Dollosuchus, a genus of tomistomine crocodilians, by Efimov (1988), but Brochu (2007) treated Dollosuchus as dubious. Several crocodilian fossils from the Paleogene of North America have also been proposed to belong to Asiatosuchus. In comparison to A. grangeri, \\"Crocodylus\\" affinis from the Bridger Formation in Wyoming has a similarly shaped splenial bone in the lower jaw and frontal bone in the skull. Although \\"C.\\" affinis is known from a complete skull, the skull material of A. grangeri is too fragmentary to support \\"C.\\" affinis being classified within Asiatosuchus. The crocodyloid species \\"Crocodylus\\" monsvialensis was named from Early Oligocene deposits in Monteviale, Italy in 1914 and reassigned to Asiatosuchus in 1993, although subsequent authors questioned this referral and considered it synonymous with Diplocynodon ratelii. \\"Crocodylus\\" vicetinus from the Middle Eocene locality of Monte Bolca, was assigned to Asiatosuchus sp. by Kotsakis et al. (2004) pending revision of the Mount Bolca crocodilian material.Kotsakis T, Delfino M, Piras P. 2004. Italian Cenozoic crocodilians: taxa, timing and biogeographic implications. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 210: 67‚Äì87. A partial skeleton of a crocodyloid from the Sulaiman Mountains of Pakistan was tentatively attributed to Asiatosuchus. The fossil was found in the Middle Eocene Drazinda Formation, a marine deposit which has also preserved the remains of archaeocete whales. The presence of a possible specimen of Asiatosuchus in marine deposits suggests that these crocodilians could have tolerated prolonged periods of time in the ocean, an ability that would have aided in the dispersal of early crocodyloids across Europe and Asia. Phylogeny Snout Phylogenetic analyses of the evolutionary relationships of crocodilians place Asiatosuchus as a member of a clade or evolutionary grouping called Crocodyloidea, which includes living crocodiles and their extinct relatives. Recent phylogenetic analyses place Asiatosuchus as a basal (\\"primitive\\") member of this clade, close to the split between Crocodyloidea and Alligatoroidea, the group that includes living alligators, caimans, and their extinct relatives. Many of the species that are most closely related to species of Asiatosuchus were originally classified in the genus Crocodilus because they superficially resemble modern crocodiles. However, the majority of early crocodilians, even some early alligatoroids, resembled modern crocodiles because a triangular, crocodile-shaped head is a primitive condition for crocodilians. Some phylogenetic analyses have placed \\"Asiatosuchus\\" germanicus as the sister taxon or closest relative of a group called Mekosuchinae. Mekosuchines are a group of crocodyloids from Australia and the South Pacific that are unusual in that they were highly specialized for life on land. If \\"A.\\" germanicus is the sister taxon of Mekosuchinae, it may have been close to the ancestry of the group. The earliest known and most basal mekosuchine, Kambara, lived during the same time as Asiatosuchus, suggesting that Asiatosuchus or an Asiatosuchus-like crocodyloid could have dispersed into Australia as the ancestor of mekosuchines. Despite the results of the phylogenetic analysis, \\"A.\\" germanicus is an unlikely candidate for the ancestor of mekosuchines because it lived very far from Australia and the likelihood that it could have reached Australia from Europe is very low. More recent phylogenetic analyses place Mekosuchinae as a clade within the family Crocodylidae, a deeply nested position that is far from Asiatosuchus. Most phylogenetic analyses do not support the idea that all species of Asiatosuchus belong to their own clade. Instead they find that Asiatosuchus species form a paraphyletic grouping, meaning that Asiatosuchus represents an evolutionary grade of successively more derived crocodyloids rather than its own separate lineage. Since a genus name is normally only applied to a monophyletic grouping by researchers who study prehistoric crocodilians, the type species A. grangeri is now considered the only valid species within Asiatosuchus. The species \\"A.\\" germanicus and \\"A. depressifrons are written in quotes because they do not belong to Asiatosuchus and have not yet been given different genus names. The relationships of other putative Asiatosuchus species are uncertain because only A. grangeri, \\"A.\\" germanicus, and \\"A.\\" depressifrons have enough distinguishing features to be included in phylogenetic analyses. Below is a cladogram from Delfino and Smith (2009) showing that Asiatosuchus species represent a non-monophyletic grouping. Delfino and Smith considered these relationships to have very weak support because only a few characteristics entered into the data matrix differed between Asiatosuchus species, and none differed between A. grangeri and \\"C.\\" affinis.

He hails from Hareid. He was interested in linguistics at an early age; during Norwegian classes in secondary school he read books in Greek and Esperanto. During his spare time he read Swahili. He combined the language interest with religious studies after a friend encouraged him to become a bible translator, eventually graduating from the MF Norwegian School of Theology with the cand.theol. degree in 1970. He also minored in Greek at the University of Oslo, as well as studying Latin and Hebrew. He was eventually given an assignment to translate the New Testament for the Norwegian Lutheran Mission, who found the official Norwegian translation too liberal. He was occupied with this translation from 1968 to 1973. In 1973 he travelled with his family to work as a priest in Ethiopia. He learned both the Amharic and Oromo languages, and was later sent to work in the Sidama Zone. While staying here, he translated the New Testament into Sidamo. It took twelve years, and he was finished in 1988. In 1989 Yri reached what he describes as a \\"crossroads\\" in his life. He left the Norwegian Lutheran Mission, and took up studies again at the University of Oslo. He ultimately took the dr.philos. degree in 1996, and in 2000 he was appointed as an associate professor. From 2002 to 2007 he conducted a large research project on languages in Ethiopia. His marriage broke down in 1989, but he later remarried, this time to a Chilean linguist.

Arno Lustiger (May 7, 1924 ‚Äì May 15, 2012)Arno Lustiger verstorben (in German) in J√ºdische Allgemeine, May 16, 2012 was a German historian and author of Jewish origin. Lustiger made significant contributions to research and document the history of Jewish resistance under Nazi rule. He was the father of the author Gila Lustiger and cousin to Jean- Marie Lustiger, archbishop of Paris.  Life  Lustiger was born and grew up in Bƒôdzin in the Polish portion of Upper Silesia. His father, David Lustiger, City Councillor of Bƒôdzin, had a company making machines for bread production. In 1939 the company was confiscated by the Nazis, but David Lustiger stayed in the company as a worker. In the beginning of 1943 the Jewish population of Bƒôdzin was detained in the Bƒôdzin ghetto. The Lustiger family were able to hide in a cellar. In August 1943, the ghetto was closed and the population was deported to the concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. A few days later, the family voluntarily went to a camp of forced workers in Annaberg, Silesia, in order to remain together as a family. However, the family was torn apart. Lustiger was deported to the concentration camp Ottmuth and later to Blechhammer, a subcamp of Auschwitz. Starting from January 21, 1945 Lustiger had to join the death march during the freezing winter towards the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in Lower Silesia, as the Soviet troops were approaching. Only half of the 4.000 inmates survived the death march. Later he was deported to Buchenwald concentration camp and to the Langenstein-Zwieberge concentration camp near Halberstadt. There the expectancy of life was around three or four weeks. In April 1945 Lustiger escaped during another death march, when the concentration camp was closed due to the approaching American troops. He was rescued by American soldiers and became a uniformed and armed translator of the US Army. Since the end of the second world war Lustiger had lived in Frankfurt and had built up a successful company for ladies' fashion. He had written articles about German-Jewish history, the Spanish civil war, the Jewish resistance and the persecution of Jews by Joseph Stalin. From 2004 to 2006 he was visiting professor at the Fritz-Bauer-Institute in Frankfurt. On January 27, 2005, Arno Lustiger held a speech in front of the German Bundestag together with Wolf Biermann. On September 10, 2006, his essay (printed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung) criticised G√ºnter Grass's treatment of his Waffen-SS membership in his latest book.

He was the founder of Trinity Engineering and served as Deputy Minister of Public Works as well as the Deputy Minister Economic Development. He was born in Unyetu-Mutomba Village in Chivhu, Zimbabwe in 1935. He was the eldest son of James Ushe Shoniwa, and had ancestry from the Mutekedza Chieftainship of Chikomba District. He was associated with the Mhofu Totem. In his youth, he moved from Chivu to Harare, where he changed his name to Aguy Clement Georgias. After his death, his brother Herbert Ushe suggested the change was intended to conceal his Shona ancestry and present himself as a member of the Coloureds community, possibly for economic reasons. In 2007, Georgias and his company Trinity Engineering were placed on the European Union (EU) sanctions list, under a 2002 EU provision that prohibited \\"entry into or transit through the territory of the EU\\" for members of the Zimbabwean Government. Georgias was deported from the United Kingdom as a result. In 2012, he sued the EU for ‚Ç¨6 million in damages for the imposition of the sanctions. The EU General Court dismissed the case in 2014. At the time of his death he was a non-constituency Senator (presumably representing the Coloureds community). He died of heart and kidney failure on 19 December 2015 at AMI Hospital in Harare. He was declared a national hero by the government of Robert Mugabe, who stated in his eulogy for Georgias that Georgias had spent \\"every cent he owned\\" fighting the EU sanctions on Zimbabwe's government. As a result, he was buried at the National Heroes Acre. Georgias's relatives claimed they were snubbed by the Mugabe government with regards to Georgias' funeral. The family expressed discontent that the Mugabe government recognized Georgias's second wife Jane and Georgias's children with her, rather than his first wife Manana. They also claimed that Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) agents forced them to attend the state funeral, which they had intended to boycott.  Personal life  At the time of his death, Georgias had eleven children and sixteen grandchildren. His nephew Carlton Ushe stated that Georgias's five oldest children were born to a woman of Indian origin from Gweru. Her name is not known and they were not married. In 1977, he married Manana Esther Georgias. After his death, Manana stated that their marriage produced no children. However, in 2017, Manana was described as the mother of Georgias's son Antony. It is not clear from the article if he is her step-son or her biological son. Georgias later entered a relationship with Jane Linda Georgias, with whom he had five children. There is some dispute as to whether this relationship was a legal marriage - some sources have referred to Jane as Georgias's wife, but the official status of their relationship has been disputed by Georgias's relatives, including his first wife Manana, after his death.  Legacy  Everson Mushava, writing for the Standard Newspaper, equated Aguy's self- denial of identity to Ngoni, a character created for a popular novel in the Shona language.http://www.thestandard.co.zw/2015/12/27/the-curious-story-of- aguy-ushe-georgias/ References Category:Zimbabwean politicians Category:Living people Category:1935 births ","title":"Aguy Georgias"},{"id":"21659177","text":"Christopher Patterson may refer to: * Chris Patterson (co-driver) (born 1968), rally co-driver * Chris Patterson (politician) (born 1971), Australian politician * Christopher Salmon Patterson (1823‚Äì1893), Canadian Puisne judge of the Supreme Court of Canada See also * Chris Paterson (born 1978), Scottish rugby union player * Chris Paterson (rugby league) (born 1980), Australian * Patterson (surname) ","title":"Christopher Patterson"},{"id":"21659182","text":"Bawa Karma () is a 1997 Sri Lankan drama film directed by Dharmasiri Bandaranayake and co-produced by Ven.

Ancestry  She was a daughter of Dobromir, a Slavic ruler who in a 1013 entry was named venerabilis senior by the contemporary chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg (975‚Äì1018). Most historians believe that Emnilda's father was a ruler over Lusatia and the Milceni lands which since 963 were part of the Saxon Eastern March. The German chronicler referred to him as senior which in this context most likely meant \\"prince\\", and showed a certain familiarity with the person. This suggests that Dobromir was someone well known to Thietmar, who was Bishop of Merseburg from 1009, and hence Emnilda's father was from the area of the Polabian Slavs close to his episcopal see. In view of her German name, Emnilda's mother possibly was the member of a Saxon comital dynasty. However, other historians have argued for a different background. Henryk ≈Åowmia≈Ñski believed Emnilda to have been a daughter of the last independent prince of the Vistulans in the Krak√≥w area. Tadeusz Wasilewski saw in her a Moravian princess.  Life  The wedding of Emnilda and the heir of the Polish throne, Boles≈Çaw, took place around 987. It was the third marriage for the young prince: his previous two wives, the daughter of Margrave Rikdag of Meissen (perhaps called Hunilda or Oda) and the Hungarian princess Judith, were repudiated after few years, but both produced offspring to Boles≈Çaw, a daughter and a son, Bezprym. During her marriage, Emnilda bore her husband five children, two sons (the future Mieszko II Lambert and Otto) and three daughters, one of them became an abbess and the other two, Regelinda and another whose name is unknown were married to Margrave Herman I of Meissen and Grand Prince Sviatopolk I of Kiev, respectively. She was mentioned by Gallus Anonymus and Thietmar of Merseburg; both chroniclers noted she was a wise and charming person. It is claimed that Emnilda had a great influence on her husband, and perhaps also in the Polish state affairs. She probably accompanied Boles≈Çaw to the meeting with Henry II at Merseburg on 23 May 1013 and perhaps she actively promoted the recognition of their son Mieszko II as a vassal of the Emperor for his government over Moravia, a fact who put in jeopardy the succession rights of Boles≈Çaw I's eldest son Bezprym, who at the end was excluded in favor of his younger half-brother. The exact date of Emnilda's death is unknown, but is assumed that this happened in 1017 at the latest, or, more likely, at the end of 1016, because on 3 February 1018 Boles≈Çaw I married with his fourth and last wife, Oda of Meissen.

The foreword is contributed by Antony Hewish. The book was launched at a workshop at the 2009 American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting in Chicago,AAAS Annual Meeting 2009 Workshop Program and then in the UK at a discussion at the Royal Society chaired by Onora O'Neill, in a week when it was also featured on the Today Programme.Interview with John Polkinghorne by John Humphrys BBC Today Programme 2-Mar-09 Key themes and ideas AAAS Annual Conference with President James J. McCarthy (standing) and authors The book grew out of questions generated at a website organized to communicate Polkinghorne's ideas. It groups selected questions under seven topics:One Scientist's Faith review in Physics World April-2009 # Leading Questions gives an overview of Polkinghorne's views on nine questions, including science and religion, the existence of God, and atheism. # The Concept and Existence of God begins with \\"Can God's existence be proved?\\" and addresses The God Delusion, omniscience, predestination and the Trinity. # The Universe considers the Big Bang, the Anthropic Principle and a Theory of Everything. # Evolution starts with \\"Is evolution a fact or a theory?\\", discusses Intelligent Design, which is deemed an unfortunate use of language and a theological mistake, and explores whether the mind can be explained by evolution. # Evil suggests that \\"The evil that is not the result of human sin seems to be the result of the workings out of the natural laws of physics and biology\\" and considers the Devil, cancer and Original Sin. # Human Being suggests that Adam and Eve refer to the first spiritually conscious human beings, that the soul is something logically distinct from the body but not a separate physical entity, and that conscience is \\"our deepest understanding of right and wrong\\". # Religion begins with \\"Is atheism a form of faith?\\", suggests that \\"For each part of the Bible you have to ask what kind of writing it is and what God is trying to tell us through it\\", and considers the Resurrection and that \\"God will not force us to accept his love ... [but] will save everyone he can - no-one will be excluded because God did not want them.\\" Each question is followed by the responses of Beale and Polkinghorne, sometimes as a single answer and sometimes by the two authors individually. Its three appendixes constitute a third of the book: * Anthropic Fine-Tuning draws on Martin Rees's book Just Six Numbers to illustrate the point that if the fundamental constants of physics were slightly different then no intelligent life could exist in the Universe. It then considers Multiverse ideas and especially Lee Smolin's Cosmological natural selection, which, it suggests, has problems from physics and evolutionary dynamics. It also discusses notions of complexity and improbability. * Brain and Consciousness suggests that \\"pretty much everything in the universe has a physical aspect and an informational aspect, neither of which is more foundational than the other\\", and that informational entities like the Mass in B Minor cannot be considered as material objects. It proposes that \\"your body and your mind are different aspects of you\\", and that the inherent uncertainties of neuron firing mean that the brain is not fully deterministic. * Evolution begins by pointing out that since Augustine Christians have not taken the Genesis creation accounts \\"literally\\", and that key developers of the current theory (e.g. Gregor Mendel, Ronald Fisher, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Simon Conway-Morris and Martin Nowak) have been Christians, suggesting that there is no conflict between Christianity and evolution, that small genetic changes can have big effects, that genetic determinism is mistaken, and that there are evolutionary benefits to religion. Reviews Julian Baggini, writing in the Financial Times, said that Polkinghorne has no problems reconciling his faith with his science and suggests that \\"despite the complexity of some of the scientific issues discussed\\", the book \\"is a commendably clear read\\". He says \\"it is a pity that the people most likely to buy this book are those simply seeking intellectual reassurance that their faith is not irrational. Those who would most benefit from reading it are in fact fundamentalists who think that evolutionary science must be wrong, and overconfident atheists who believe that the religious are manifestly irrational.‚Äù Julian Baggini \\"A Twist of Faith: How to reconcile religious belief with science\\" Financial Times Life and Arts, p.16, 21 Feb.,'09.see also Baggini's additional comments on his talkingphilosophy site and the subsequent discussion A. C. Grayling wrote a highly critical review in the New Humanist. He states that the responses to questions concerning science and religion boil down to three strategies, God of the gaps, inference to the best explanation, and religion and science explain truths in different domains. He considers the first two refutable by undergraduates, and for the third strategy to work, he contends that one has to \\"cherry-pick which bits of scripture and dogma are to be taken as symbolic and which as literally true\\" in order to conveniently avoid the possibility of direct and testable confrontation with science. He concludes the review by expressing his outrage at the Royal Society's decision to allow its premises to be used for the launch of the book, as in his opinion this amounts to having \\"the superstitious lucubrations of illiterate goatherds living several thousand years ago given the same credibility as contemporary scientific research.\\"A. C. Grayling: Book Review: Questions of Truth. New Humanist 124 (2), March/April 2009. Physics World commends the authors for handling the diverse readership, skeptics and believers, in a \\"remarkably even-handed way\\", but laments that concerns with specifics of Christian doctrine may limit the book's appeal; however, scientifically minded readers may find the extensive appendices a good starting point. The reviewer concludes that the book provides valuable insight for those interested in the science and religion debate. In addition, some periodicals have included brief reviews. Publishers Weekly said, \\"Many readers will welcome this accessible format, but some may find the blurring of science and theology confusing.\\"Publishers Weekly Review The Library Journal described it as intriguing and a thought-provoking work, and said that John Polkinghorne was ‚Äúa kind of antidote to Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris for the intellectual theist or Christian.\\"Library Journal Review Episcopal Life says the book offers \\"some interesting conclusions\\".Episcopal Life 3-Mar-09 Ian Sample, reflecting over his interview with Polkinghorne for The Guardian, stated that there was much in the book that he found offensive, especially the idea that God needs to remain hidden from his creation lest they be completely overwhelmed, a notion Sample describes as \\"a bit patronising\\".

The housekeeper explains that the rebels have asked everyone in the village to keep the lights off, and that for all, times have been bad. Suwisal recalls brief memories of the piano and a young girl shyly peering out behind the drapes at him and his aunts. Several days earlier, Suwisal's fianc√©e (Yashoda Wimaladharma) calls to remind him of jury duty. He is to spend the next three days listening to a theft/murder case. The defendant, Piyum (Swarna Mallawarachchi) has been charged with the murder of John Wijesinghe. She is a prostitute and Wijesinghe, a client. He did not have enough money to pay her, so instead of continuing with her work, she slipped sleeping pills into his drink. Piyum left the room and Wijesinghe died. Decades before, a young Suwisal goes back to the village and ancestral home to work on his thesis called, \\"The Possible Result of Disillusioned Rural Youth and the Impact of the Free Education Policy\\". He encounters the servant woman working at his aunts' home. He sleeps with her, and soon thereafter, leaves to go back to the city. Through letters, he learns she is pregnant, and stops all communication with her. During the second day of the trial, Suwisal goes to his lawyer friend Vicky (Tony Ranasinghe) and explains that he knows Piyum. She is the former servant at his aunt's house. Vicky advises Suwisal to keep quiet and wait for the trial to finish. Piyum does not indicate that she knows Suwisal, which causes him to question his actions and character.

They currently play in the S√©rie B, the second tier of Brazilian football, as well as in the Campeonato Paulista S√©rie A1, the top tier of the S√£o Paulo state football league. Originally from It√°polis in S√£o Paulo state, Oeste was founded on January 25, 1921. They play in black and red shirts, black shorts and red socks. History The club was founded on January 25, 1921 by two brothers from Rio de Janeiro. One was a supporter of Flamengo, while the other was a supporter of Fluminense. A training match against an amateur club from the municipality of Fazenda Itaquer√™ was set to decide if the club would be named Flamengo or Fluminense. With a victory, the club would be named Flamengo, while if defeated the club would be named Fluminense. The club beat their opponents 3‚Äì0, but adopted the name Oeste Futebol Clube, after the Center-West region of S√£o Paulo state, while Flamengo's colors were chosen. The club competed in the Campeonato Paulista S√©rie A1 for the first time in 2004, after winning the S√©rie A2 in the previous season. The club returned to the S√©rie A1 in 2009, after being defeated by Santo Andr√© in the S√©rie A2 final in 2008. Oeste won the 2012 S√©rie C after beating Icasa in the final. In 2016, they sealed a partnership with Gr√™mio Osasco Audax, 2016 Campeonato Paulista A1 runners-up, for the 2016 Serie B, which included mixing players from both teams in one squad and playing home games at Audax's stadium in Osasco. In 2017, Oeste was relocated definitely to the city of Barueri, since the Est√°dio Municipal dos Amaros wasn't allowed to host S√©rie B matches due to its limitations, and the City Hall of It√°polis, owners of the stadium, couldn't reach an agreement with the club. Symbols The club's mascot is a jaguar, named after one of the city's main rivers, Rio da On√ßa (On√ßa River), on√ßa is Portuguese for jaguar. Stadium For most of their history, Oeste's home stadium has been the Est√°dio Municipal dos Amaros, which has a maximum capacity of 6,000 people. In 2016 they played their home games at Prefeito Jos√© Liberatti, located in Osasco. The stadium has a maximum capacity of 17,430 people and was inaugurated on December 16, 1996.

In June 2014 the company sold its biosciences unit to Agena Bioscience for up to $35.8 million. In July 2016, it was announced that diagnostic and testing giant LabCorp will acquire Sequenom, paying $2.40 for every outstanding share of Sequenom stock. The acquisition was completed in September 2016. Competition Companies also offering non-invasive prenatal genetic testing include Ariosa, Ravgen, Illumina (Verinata Health),, PerkinElmer and Natera (The Panorama Prenatal Test),. Other companies and universities that are working towards developing non-invasive prenatal testing include Stanford University,. Patent litigation In January 2012, Sequenom entered a patent battle with competing companies, Ariosa and Natera, accusing them of infringing the \\"540 patent\\" (). The cases are Sequenom Inc. v. Natera Inc. 12-cv-0184, Sequenom v. Ariosa Diagnostics Inc., 12-cv-0189, U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego), and Ariosa v. Sequenom. Verinatal Health and Stanford University later filed suit against Sequenom in a dispute over the 'Quake patent'. Verinata claims that Sequenom's lawyers sent it a letter in 2010 alleging that \\"'the practice of non-invasive prenatal diagnostics, including diagnosis of the Down Syndrome and other genetic disorders, using cell-free nucleic acids in a sample of maternal blood infringes' the '540 patent, as well as the claims of a pending United States Patent Application.\\" The '540 patent was invented by Isis Ltd. and expires in 2017. Stanford University owns the Quake patents and licensing rights; Verinata is its exclusive licensee. In April 2012, Sequenom acquired two pending patents from Helicos Biosciences. In consideration for the sale and transfer of the purchased assets, Sequenom paid Helicos $1.3 million. The Helicos patent applications (US Patent application 12/709,057 and 12/727,824) cover methods for detecting fetal nucleic acids and diagnosing fetal abnormalities. In July 2012, The United States District Court denied Sequenom's motion for a preliminary injunction motion against Ariosa Diagnostics. In August 2013, The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the District Court decision and remanded that case to the District Court. In the Ariosa litigation, the District Court (N.D.Cal.) held that the '540 patent was invalid because it claimed a natural phenomenon, the presence of cell-free fetal DNA fragments in maternal blood. On June 13, 2015, the CAFC affirmed the District Court's judgment. Finally on December 2, 2015, the Federal Circuit declined to rehear en banc. SEQureDx scandal In 2009, Sequenom Center for Molecular Medicine (SCMM) was expected to launch the SEQureDx prenatal screening tests for Down syndrome and Rhesus D. Subsequent investigation revealed significant flaws in the studies of the test's effectiveness.Sequenom shares plunge after probe reveals test flaws, MarketWatch, Sept. 28, 2009 As a result, the board of directors of Sequenom fired CEO Harry Stylli, senior vice president of research and development Elizabeth Dragon and three other employees after a probe discovered that the company had failed to adequately supervise its Down syndrome test.

In 2010, Sequenom paid $14 million to settle a shareholder class-action lawsuit that arose from the errors in the development of the Down syndrome test.Sequenom in $14 million settlement over test delay, Reuters, Jan 15, 2010 Sequenom executives are under investigation by the SEC for insider trading before announcement of problems with the test.Did Sequenom Insiders Sell Stock Before Data Corruption Was Revealed?, Jim Edwards, Nov 10, 2009 On September 1, 2011 Sequenom entered into a cease-and-desist order with SEC.https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2011/34-65247.pdf  MaterniT21 PLUS  MaterniT21 PLUS is Sequenom Center for Molecular Medicine's prenatal test for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). The test operates by sampling cell-free DNA in the mother's blood, which contains some DNA from the fetus. The proportions of DNA from sequences from chromosome 21, 18, or 13 can indicate whether the fetus has trisomy in that chromosome. In a randomized controlled trial of 1,696 pregnancies at high risk for Down syndrome, the test correctly identified 98.6% of the actual cases of Down syndrome (209 out of 212), with a false positive rate of 0.2% (3 of 1471 pregnancies without Down); the test gave no result in 0.8% of the cases tested (13 of 1696). The primary advantage of MaterniT21 PLUS over the other major high accuracy tests for Down syndrome, Amniocentesis and Chorionic villus sampling, is that MaterniT21 PLUS is noninvasive. Because amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are invasive, they have a chance of causing miscarriage. = History = On August 4, 2011, Sequenom said it would call its new blood test for Down syndrome in pregnancy MaterniT21 when the product went on sale in the United States.http://www.sequenom.com/Files/PDF- Documents/MaterniT21_Launch_Presentation/ On August 11, 2011, Sequenom announced European licensing agreement with LifeCodexx. The companies agreed to collaborate in the development and launch of a trisomy 21 laboratory- developed test and other aneuploidies testing in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, with the potential for additional launches in other countries. Under the initial five year licensing agreement, Sequenom granted LifeCodexx licenses to key patent rights, including European Patent EP0994963B1 and pending application EP2183693A1 that enable the development and commercialization of a non-invasive aneuploidy test utilizing circulating cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma. On October 24, 2011 International Society of Prenatal Diagnostics (ISPD) issued a rapid response statement in response to the launch of Sequenom non-invasive Trisomy 21 (MaterniT21) test.http://www.ispdhome.org/public/news/2011/ISPD_RapidResponse_MPS_24Oct11.pdf On October 17, 2011 Sequenom announced that a clinical validation study leading to the introduction of the MaterniT21 LDT had been published in the journal Genetics in Medicine.

The species was described and named by Lamarck in 1792.Leeuwenberg, A. J. M. (1979) The Loganiaceae of Africa XVIII Buddleja L. II, Revision of the African & Asiatic species. H. Veenman & Zonen, Wageningen, Nederland.Lamarck, J - B., (1785). Enc. 1: 513. 1785. Description B. salviifolia, white form. Longstock Park Nursery Buddleja salviifolia is a large, semi-evergreen shrub, multi-stemmed, with untidy, drooping branches, typically reaching a height of 4 - 8 m. The bark is grey-brown and stringy. The shoots are quadrangular in section, and covered with a dense reddish-brown indumentum. The distinctive leaves, with their rugose upper surfaces, bear a resemblance to those of sage, hence the specific epithet. The leaf is sessile to shortly petiolate, the blade narrowly ovate to narrowly oblong, long acuminate to an acute apex, and cordate at the base. The inflorescences are terminal conical panicles approximately 12 √ó 8 cm, with occasional auxiliary heads appearing in autumn. The flowers range in colour from white, through cream and mauve to purple; the corollas relatively short, at just 4 mm. However, the most striking feature of the flowers is considered to be their scent, judged by some to the best of all the buddlejas, and even bearing comparison with Chanel perfume. Hardiness: USDA zone 8.Stuart, D. (2006). Buddlejas. RHS Plant Collector Guide. Timber Press, Oregon. . Cultivation The species is relatively common in cultivation; moderately frost hardy and tolerant of dry soils, it is grown in the UK, however its large size and ungainly habit, in the worst buddleja 'bent hatstand' tradition, render it a choice for the larger garden only. Several specimens form part of the NCCPG national collection held by Longstock Park Nursery, near Stockbridge in Hampshire. Occasionally in the UK and France it is mislabelled Buddleja myriantha, a dissimilar Chinese species. Uses Decoctions of the plant are believed to have various medicinal benefits in its native lands. The wood, hard and heavy, has traditionally been used for assegais and fishing rods. Otherwise, it is used as fuel, and for hedging.

Computermusic.org (2010-11-15). Retrieved on 2010-12-22. Current research includes the application of AI in music composition, performance, theory and digital sound processing. Several music software programs have been developed that use AI to produce music. Like its applications in other fields, the A.I. in this case also simulates mental tasks. A prominent feature is the capability of the A.I. algorithm to learn based on information obtained such as the computer accompaniment technology, which is capable of listening to and following a human performer so it can perform in synchrony. Artificial intelligence also drives the so-called interactive composition technology, wherein a computer composes music in response to the performance of a live musician. There are several other A.I. applications to music that covers not only music composition, production, and performance but also the way it is marketed and consumed. History In 1960, Russian researcher R. Kh. Zaripov published worldwide first paper on algorithmic music composing using the \\"Ural-1\\" computer. In 1965, inventor Ray Kurzweil premiered a piano piece created by a computer that was capable of pattern recognition in various compositions. The computer was then able to analyze and use these patterns to create novel melodies. The computer was debuted on Steve Allen's I've Got a Secret program, and stumped the hosts until film star Henry Morgan guessed Ray's secret. In 1997, an artificial intelligence program called Experiments in Musical Intelligence (EMI) appeared to outperform a human composer at the task of composing a piece of music imitating the style of Bach. Software applicationsInteractive scores= Multimedia Scenarios in interactive scores are represented by temporal objects, temporal relations and interactive objects. Examples of temporal objects are sounds, videos and light controls. Temporal objects can be triggered by interactive objects (usually launched by the user) and several temporal objects can be executed simultaneously. A temporal object may contain other temporal objects: this hierarchy allows us to control the start or end of a temporal object by controlling the start or end of its parent. Hierarchy is ever-present in all kinds of music: Music pieces are often hierarchized by movements, parts, motives, measures, among other segmentations.Mauricio Toro, Myriam Desainte-Catherine, Camilo Rueda.

This link is based historically upon early and continuing reference to the name \\"Na Zderaze\\" for the existing church building. In 1091, the Czech lord Zderad was killed during the siege of Brno, and was buried in the earlier church which was near Prague. Zderad's name was then immortalized in the name of the street \\"Na Zderaze\\" which is adjacent to the cathedral, thus establishing a connection to this site that was hallowed by St. Methodius. From 1115, the church of Saints Peter and Paul stood on the site of the present church, around which the Knights of the Cross built the Zderazsky monastery. During the Hussite Wars, the church was largely destroyed, leaving only a part of the choir standing. In 1705, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Prague, Breuner, established a retirement home for priests on the site of the monastery next to which a church was later built. =World War II= Bullet-scarred window to the crypt In 1942, during World War II, the cathedral was where a last stand was made by SOE-trained Czech and Slovak agents involved in the assassination of SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Reinhard Heydrich.

HistoryEarly development= The development of sanctioned, varsity-level athletics at Washington & Jefferson College began to develop in 1883, when the student body began agitating for more formal athletic programs.Scarborough 1979 p. 23 Many other schools had developed athletic programs by that time and advocates felt that a more formal athletic program would increase school spirit, which they felt was lacking.Scarborough 1979 p. 18 In 1890, students formed the Athletic Association, charging the 75 members a $1 membership fee that went to fund athletics.Scarborough 1979 p. 24 By a vote, the students selected cardinal and black to be the school colors, as the preferred scheme of navy and orange had been taken by the Western University of Pennsylvania. An oil strike was discovered on the Old Fairgrounds, which helped finance the renovation of that facility into the \\"College Field,\\" including the construction of a new grandstand.Scarborough 1979 p. 29-30 At the close of the 19th century, the concerns over the influence of professionalism in college sports, especially the use of itinerant student and professional football player John Brallier, caused the faculty to adopt the first eligibility requirements for student athletes.Scarborough 1979 p. 36-40 Professor Edward Linton represented W&J; at the initial meeting of the International Athletic Association of the United States in 1906, where the first national standards for edibility and amateurism were developed. At that meeting, Linton expressed a desire for the student athlete to be \\"relieved of the incubus of the professional coach.\\"Scarborough 1979 p. 36-37 =Student and Faculty Athletic Committees= By the early 1900s, \\"football fever\\" had swept through the student body, leading the College administration to take steps to further integrate the sport into the educational framework, including the development of a new governance structure. The new Student Athletic Committee and Faculty Athletic Committees instituted a minimum 1-year residency requirement to combat transient students and created an alumni coach system, so the coaches would be more sympathetic to the educational objectives of the college.Scarborough 1979 p. 42 In 1910, the football program was in danger of being dissolved due to crushing debt.Scarborough 1979 p. 47-48 The Student Athletic Committee proposed a $1 per term student fee to fund the team, a proposal that was met with initial resistance from the student body. However, team manager and beloved student solicitor Robert M. Murphy, was able to convince the students to accept the fee. The Student Athletic Committee agreed to retract the residency rule, as it was blamed for contributing to losses, but instituted other student athlete requirements, including a ban on Academy students, raising entrance requirements, and creating a stringent system of recording absences. However, the Faculty Athletic Committee balked, vetoing the new rules. The firings of Dr. G.H. Winchester and Dr. H.E. Wells highlighted the growing tension between athletics and academics.Scarborough 1979 p. 68-70 As orchestrated by a group of alumni football supporters, the two professors were brought before a faculty committee for not having the requisite support for the athletic programs. At the time, Dr. Winchester was serving in France during World War I and Wells maintained during the hearing that he did not object to athletics per se, but rather the way it was run at Washington & Jefferson. The event, known nationally as the Winchester-Wells case, was investigated by the American Association of University Professors and was the profiled in Upton Sinclair's book The Goose-Step, a muckraking investigation into the state of American colleges. =Athletic Council and financial reforms= During the Presidency of Simon Strousse Baker, the Student and Faculty Athletic Committees were heavily in debt and approaching insolvency.Scarborough 1979 p. 83-96 The gate receipts for football games, the Committees' main source of income, had fallen as the team began to lag behind the larger schools it traditionally played. A report in 1929 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching showed that the W&J; athletics program, like many programs at other colleges, held a large \\"slush fund\\" with donations from alumni and businessmen totaling $25,000 to $50,000 per year. This \\"extreme case of subsidizing\\" funded all college expenses for football players, plus \\"paychecks\\" to top performers.Scarborough 1979 p. 96-97 To alleviate this problem, President Baker proposed to wholly separate athletic funds from general College funds by creating an \\"Athletic Council\\" to take control of the athletic program. The proposal was defeated, and Baker was eventually hounded from office. In spite of that failure, a 1931 followup to the original Carnegie Foundation report commended W&J; for creating some institutional controls, including limiting subsidization to tuition, room, and board. Baker's successor, Ralph Cooper Hutchison, himself more personally popular than Baker, was able to bring even more control to the athletic program by reducing the number of scholarships from 18 to 8 and limiting the practice of playing against powerhouse football teams.Scarborough 1979 p. 103 Later, the athletic program was reorganized under an Athletic Director and the practice of awarding athletic scholarships was abolished.Scarborough 1979 p. 109 In 1937, Hutchison created a whole new governing structure for athletics, the Athletic Council, which was not unlike the plan proposed by Baker a decade earlier.Scarborough 1979 p. 110 The new Athletic Council, composed of four faculty members and six students, had responsibility for dispensing student appropriations and income from ticket sales. The Board of Trustees' own Athletic Committee would govern the hiring and payment of coaches. The new system was intended to unite the intramural and intercollegiate athletics programs, reinstate faculty into athletic governance, give more responsibility to students, and to create a freshman football program. D.C. Morrow, former football coach and member of the Athletic Committee dissented, advocating for a return to the scholarship model, blaming the waning alumni interest in the college on the team's poor performance. However, the College's indebtedness at that time was $133,000, most of which was the result of player subsidization.Scarborough 1979 p. 112 At that time, athletics took up half of the student activity fee. In an attempt to stabilize the fiscal picture, the athletic budget was cut significantly, with freshman football and boxing discontinued. The plan worked, and by the 1940s, the athletic finances were stabilized. This signaled the end of the football team's games against larger schools. Athletic colors and nicknames In 1890, a vote by the Athletic Association selected cardinal and black to be the school colors; the preferred scheme of orange and navy has been taken by Western University of Pennsylvania. Since then, the phrase \\"Red and Black\\" has been used to refer to the school itself, the college newspaper (Red & Black) and the athletic teams. The early athletic teams also were known as the \\"Jaymen,\\" a play on the college's nickname \\"W&J;\\". By the 1930s, the word \\"Jaymen\\" was used to refer to the students in general. The use of this term had died off even before the college went co-educational in 1970. The college's modern nickname of \\"Presidents\\" was coined in 1917 by a sportswriter from Richmond, Virginia covering the football game between W&J; and the Washington & Lee Generals. Larry Stewart, the W&J;'s football publicity director at the time, quickly adopted the nickname on a permanent basis. In July 2016, the school introduced a new brand identity, working with New York City-based SME Branding. Athletic facilities The first athletic facility at Washington & Jefferson was the Old Gym. College Field was purchased in 1885. Originally a fairground, it was developed into a proper athletic field after the discovery of oil on the grounds.Scarborough 1979 pp. 29‚Äì30 It was renovated in 1999 and rechristened Cameron Stadium after the addition of an all-weather track, the installation of a FieldTurf football field, and renovated grandstands and media facilities. In 1970, the Henry Memorial Center was built. The venue was renovated in 2019 and renamed the Salvitti Family Gymnasium. It houses a main gymnasium for basketball, wrestling, and volleyball, a wrestling practice room, a weight room and the Eaton Fitness Center. The natatorium, a six-lane, 25-yard pool, with depths ranging four to seven feet deep, hosts the men's and women's swimming and diving teams as well as the men's and women's water polo squads. The adjacent Janet L. Swanson Tennis Courts, first built 1955 and renovated in 2001, are home to the tennis teams. The softball team plays at Brooks Park, which was extensively renovated in 2004. The Ross Memorial Park and Alexandre Stadium is combined multi-purpose outdoor athletic facility for the baseball, soccer and lacrosse teams. At of Field Turf playing surface, the facility was the home of the largest continuous artificial playing surface in the world at its completion in 2004. Both turf surfaces at the facility have been recently updated. As part of extensive renovations in the Henry Memorial Center, the Eaton Fitness Center opened in the fall of 2019. Ross Memorial Park hosted the NCAA Division III Mideast Regional Baseball Championship in three consecutive years (2015, 2016 and 2017). Football Cameron Stadium, home of the football team since 1890 The football team competes in the NCAA Division III and is affiliated with the Presidents' Athletic Conference (PAC). Since its founding in 1890, the team has played their home games at Cameron Stadium. A number of players were named to the College Football All-America Team, and two players, Pete Henry and Edgar Garbisch have been elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. Several other former players have gone on to play professionally, including \\"Deacon\\" Dan Towler, Russ Stein, and Pete Henry, who was also elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team. The team has been coached by some of the greatest coaches in football history, including John Heisman, Greasy Neale, and Bob Folwell. The team was founded in 1890, quickly becoming well known for drawing large crowds and defeating a number of prominent football teams.North 1991 pp. 25‚Äì36 The faculty and administration expressed concern over the strength of the team and made efforts to reduce the influence of professionalism on the players.Scarborough 1979 pp. 36-40 During the 1910s, some sportswriters were suggesting that the Presidents were one of the top teams in the nation.North 1991 pp. 62‚Äì74 The biggest achievement in the team's history came in 1921, when the Presidents were chosen to play in 1922 Rose Bowl, playing the heavily favored California Golden Bears to a scoreless tie.North 1991 pp. 97‚Äì107 The Red and Black finished the season with a share of the 1921 national championship, as named by the Boand System. As college football developed in the 1930s and 1940s, the Presidents fell far behind their larger competitors, who were able to offer scholarships for their players.Scarborough 1979 pp. 83-96 Controversy over the poor play of the football team, and a lack of play against larger teams, contributed to the resignation of a college president.North 1991 pp. 133‚Äì142 By the 1950s, the team joined the NCAA Division III and the Presidents' Athletic Conference.North 1991 pp. 161‚Äì168 By the 1980s, the team had learned to thrive in that environment, winning a number of conference championships and regularly qualifying for the NCAA Division III playoffs.North 1991 p. 179‚Äì186 W&J; finished as the nation's runner-up in both 1992 and 1994. Under current head coach Mike Sirianni's direction, the team has advanced to the NCAA Division III Quarterfinals twice (2004 and 2008). The program won its conference record 26th PAC title in 2018. Sirianni guided W&J; to a 20-17 road victory over Ithaca in the 2019 ECAC Asa S. Bushnell Bowl. The victory improved W&J; 4-0 in bowl games. Entering the 2020-21 academic year, Sirianni ranks fifth among active head coaches in winning percentage among coaches with a minimum of 10 years experience. Sirianni has amassed a 156‚Äì36 record (.812 winning percentage) as he enters his 18th season guiding the Presidents. Men's Ice Hockey Unofficial logo The men's hockey team was founded in 1998 as a member of the Western Pennsylvania Collegiate Hockey League (WPCHL). In 2001, the team joined the Eastern Collegiate Hockey League. That year, the team won the Milan Mountaineer Invitational Hockey Tournament at West Virginia University. The club currently competes in the College Hockey Mid America Conference, a Division I regional league of the American Collegiate Hockey Association The club made appearances in the ACHA National Tournament in 2004, 2005, and 2007. The team plays at the IceoPlex at Southpointe. The club plays home games at the Iceoplex at Southpointe, the practice facility for the Pittsburgh Penguins. The team defeated West Virginia University by the score of 5‚Äì3 at the Ice Zone in Boardman, OH to win the 2008 College Hockey Mid America Conference championship, avenging a loss to Duquesne University in the finals in 2007. Senior Craig Frey was named the 2008 CHMA Tournament MVP. W&J; won back to back Eastern Collegiate Hockey League (ECHL) titles, including a double overtime victory over Niagara University in 2003. In 2000‚Äì2001, Washington & Jefferson won the WPCHA Championship as Brian Grinnik was named the Jack McKinnon MVP. The program has had three ACHA Division I All-Stars: Mario Panucci (2008, 2009), Ryne Savisky (2010), Dave Crockett (2011). The team's current head coach is Lou Biancaniello, assistant coach Brian Pajack, and goaltending coach Sean Moloney. The team was previously coached by Jim Driscoll and Dean Ferarri. Prior to Driscoll, the team was coached by John Harford, USA Hockey since 1967 with 40 years of hockey experience. Harford coached the Presidents during the 2007-2008 and 2008‚Äì2009 seasons. Former Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman and two-time Stanley Cup champion Peter Taglianetti preceded Harford as head coach. Taglianetti coached the Presidents during the 2005-2006 and 2006‚Äì2007 seasons, helping lead the Presidents to the 2007 CHMA regular season championship and to the 2007 ACHA Division I National Tournament. Prior to Taglianetti, W&J; was coached by Dave Hornack who led the Presidents to ACHA National Tournaments in 2004 and 2005. Rugby The Washington and Jefferson Rugby Club was founded in 2004, and fields both men's and women's teams. It is a member of USA Rugby, the Midwest Rugby Union, and the Allegheny Rugby Union. The club competes in the Allegheny Rugby Union Collegiate Division 3 against teams such as Juniata Rugby Football Club, Carnegie Mellon Rugby Football Club and Geneva Rugby Football Club. The club also competes in an unofficial Presidents' Athletic Conference Championship every spring. In 2004, the men's club won the 2004 Allegheny Rugby Union Division 3 championship. They are now one of the most successful teams at Washington and Jefferson College. Under a newly appointed head coach, so far in 2011, the club is a perfect 8‚Äì0.

W&J;'s baseball team plays at the all-turf Ross Memorial Ballpark, a site selected to host the 2015, 2016 and 2017 NCAA D-III regional tournament. Pitchers Eddie Nogay of Weirton, W.Va. (2011‚Äì14) and Riley Groves (2014-17) of Louisville, Ohio are tied for the most in school history with 28. Nick Vento (2014‚Äì17) is the all-time home run leader with 26 career dingers. Vento is also the school's all-time hit (255) and RBI (168) leader. Derek Helbing (2017) and Neil Pascarella (2010) are tied for the school's single-season home run record with 12. Clay Martin was vital to the team's success in 2019, as the senior from Canonsburg, Pa. recorded a school-record 12 saves, six of which came in postseason play. In 2017, the W&J; baseball team made history as they won the 2017 NCAA Mideast Regional tournament to advance to their first Division III College World Series in school history. The team earned the Presidents Athletic Conference's automatic bid after winning the 2017 PAC regular season and tournament championships. In regional play, the Presidents won their first 3 games earning their first spot in a regional championship game in school history. W&J; lost game 1 to SUNY-Cortland 7‚Äì6, but bounced back to win 6‚Äì3 in game two to advance to the 2017 Division III World Series. The Presidents maintained this momentum in Appleton, Wisconsin as they would win their first 3 games to win POOL A and advance to the best of 3 Championship series against California Lutheran. W&J; would win game 1 12-2 behind a complete game effort from pitcher Matt Heslin. The Presidents would lose the next two games and finish as the National Runner-up with a Division III best 42 wins and 13 losses, also a new W&J; school record. During the 2019 season, W&J; would advance to the Division III College World Series for the second time in three seasons. W&J; compiled a 38‚Äì13 record with a 24‚Äì3 mark against conference competition. W&J;'s postseason run started with its 12th PAC title, as the team defeated Bethany 8‚Äì1 on May 11. The Presidents outscored the opposition by a 27‚Äì5 score as it cruised to three straight wins in the PAC Tournament. W&J; would continue their run the next weekend, as the Presidents traveled to Salisbury University. The Presidents opened the NCAA Division III Regional with a 4‚Äì1 win over the host Sea Gulls, who entered the tournament ranked 10th in the country. W&J; followed with a pair of wins over #11 Rowan University to capture the NCAA Salisbury Regional on May 19 and advance to the NCAA Super Regional round. The following weekend, W&J; would travel to Misericordia University for a best of three series with the Cougars. W&J; earned a sweep of the series, winning game one by an 8‚Äì3 score before claiming game two by a 5-4 margin.

There are two folded lithologies: quartzite (originally sandy sediment) and pelite (originally clayey sediment). The index minerals can only grow in the pelite. The highest indicated isograd is the solidus of hydrated granite, at higher metamorphic grade partial melting occurred in the quartzite. Metamorphic zones in Scottish Highlands, the region where they were first recognized by geologist George Barrow in 1912. Most of the region has Barrow zones, but an area north of Aberdeen has Buchan zones (andalusite and biotite). In geology, a metamorphic zone is an area where, as a result of metamorphism, the same combination of minerals occur in the bedrock. These zones occur because most metamorphic minerals are only stable in certain intervals of temperature and pressure.See for example Best (2003), pp 431-436 for a good summary Concept The temperature and pressure at which the mineralogical composition of a rock equilibrated can vary laterally through a metamorphic terrane. The two parameters together determine the metamorphic grade. The difference in grade between two locations is called the metamorphic gradient. Planes that connect points with the same metamorphic grade are called isograds. The secant lines of isograds with the surface form lines on a geologic map. Changes in mineralogical composition in a terrane reflect differences in metamorphic grade of the rocks. Minerals that are characteristic for a certain metamorphic grade are called index minerals. The first or last appearance of an index mineral (the place where a metamorphic reaction is observed) forms an easily recognizable isograd. A metamorphic zone is the region between two such easily recognizable isograds. Often they are named for the most characteristic index mineral of the zone. Whether a certain index mineral occurs is also dependent on the composition of the rock itself. Many index minerals have complicated chemical compositions. If not all necessary elements are abundant, the mineral will not grow. When mapping the metamorphic grade of a terrane, a geologist has to take the lithology of the rock in account. Lithologies are mainly dependent on the protolith, the original rock before metamorphism. The main lithologies are ultramafic, mafic, felsic (or quartzo-feldspathic), pelitic and calcareous. In all of these (and other) lithologies, different combinations of minerals occur at a certain grade. The metamorphic zones in these lithologies can also be different. Types of metamorphic zones The type of metamorphic zones in a terrane are also determined by the form of metamorphism. This is dependent on the geodynamic (tectonic and magmatic) setting in which metamorphism took place. The sequence of metamorphic zones is called a metamorphic facies series, and the most common of these is Barrovian (called after George Barrow who first mentioned it in 1912). In this series of zones, both pressure and temperature increase gradually along the metamorphic gradient. Barrovian metamorphism takes place during regional metamorphism, caused by crustal thickening in the roots of an orogenic belt (under mountain chains). Barrovian zones are especially easy to recognize in pelitic rocks. The prograde sequence of Barrovian zones is: :chlorite - biotite - garnet - staurolite - kyanite - sillimanite Andalusite crystals in Dalradian metamorphic rock at Boyndie Bay in the Buchan metamorphic zone of north-east Scotland Often only part of the series can be found. Another metamorphic facies series is the Buchan series, that sees a fast increase in temperature but a relatively small increase in pressure. Characteristic minerals include andalusite, biotite and cordierite. The metamorphic prograde sequence of the Buchan zone series is: biotite - cordierite - andalusite - sillimanite Buchan metamorphism occurs often in extensional settings, for example at rift basins. In contact metamorphism (metamorphism caused by high temperatures at low pressure in the vicinity of an igneous intrusion) a local contact aureole of zones is formed around a heat source. In rocks in subduction zones, that are transported to great depths in relatively low temperatures, rare types of metamorphic zones can develop. Two facies series are the Franciscan and Sanbagawa types.

Its use principally arose in British popular culture through comedic references to the food item as emblematic of the unappetising fare available aboard Great Britain's railway service during the period of nationalisation from 1948 to 1994. According to former BR caterer Myrna Tuddenham, the poor reputation of BR sandwiches probably derived from the practice of keeping the sandwiches \\"under glass domes on the counters in refreshment rooms until the corners turned up\\". Despite the many jokes at its expense, British Rail documents show that in 1993, its last full year as a public company, eight million sandwiches were sold. Historian Keith Lovegrove wrote that it was \\"a sandwich of contradictions; it could be cold and soggy, or stale and hard, and the corners of the isosceles triangle-shaped bread would often curl up like the pages of a well-thumbed paperback\\". References in news and popular culture Sandwiches served on trains were a source of amusement long before the advent of British Rail, as evidenced by a humorous column in the October 1884 edition of the American Railway Journal: The British Rail sandwich was often ridiculed on British radio and television and in numerous books. An episode of The Goon Show entitled \\"The Collapse of the British Railway Sandwich System\\" was first broadcast on the BBC Home Service on 8 March 1954. The Goon Show: Volume 23 \\"The Collapse of the British Railway Sandwich System\\" (BBC Radio Collection CD ‚Äì Amazon listing ‚Äì 25 February 2009) In 1972, the show Milligna (or Your Favourite Spike) included spoof news items, including \\"Long-missing Van Gogh ear found in a British Rail sandwich\\". In his book Queuing for Beginners: The Story of Daily Life From Breakfast to Bedtime, Joe Moran describes the British Rail sandwich as \\"a metaphor for social decline since it became a running joke on The Goon Show\\". Bill Bryson wrote in Notes from a Small Island: \\"I can remember when you couldn't buy a British Rail sandwich without wondering if this was your last act before a long period on a life-support machine.\\" The British Rail sandwich has been used as a negative point of comparison for other ready-to-serve meals, especially regarding transportation in the United Kingdom, and representative of the negative effects of British nationalisation of industry in the middle of the 20th century. A 1997 article in The Independent referred to the sandwich as \\"an indictment of statist, bureaucratic corporations\\" privatised by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had \\"swept aside James Callaghan, prices and incomes policies and the British Rail sandwich\\". It has also been used as a negative point of comparison for poor service in general. In 1988, Investors Chronicle described British Telecom's quality of service as \\"attracting the sort of public abuse once reserved for the British Rail sandwich\\". In 2007, Sir Michael Bishop, then chairman of airline BMI, wrote that Heathrow Airport \\"now has the reputation formerly held by the British Rail sandwich\\". Sandwich recipe In 2001, the National Railway Museum in York discovered a November 1971 document featuring sandwich recipes, issued by Director of Rail Catering Bill Currie. The document states its aim to make BR meals \\"the best on the track\\" and describes the precise amount of sandwich filling to be placed on the sandwich. The recipe also specifies, in order to make the sandwiches attractive ‚Äì and to be able to tell what was inside ‚Äì at least a third of the filling be placed in the centre, so that when cut diagonally, the customer would see the contents. For luncheon meat and sardines, the filling should total two-thirds of an ounce of meat. On an egg and cress sandwich, each sandwich was to contain one- twelfth of a punnet of cress. The document was featured in a 2002 exhibition of the National Railway Museum, \\"British Rail ‚Äì A Moving Story\\". A typical ham sandwich would contain one slice of ham with another slice folded in half and placed diagonally over the first one. When the sandwich was cut diagonally it would make it appear that it contained three slices of ham when in reality it only contained two.  In other countries  In France, this kind of unappetising sandwich is named \\"sandwich SNCF\\" or \\"sandwich TGV\\", by assimilation with the quality of sandwiches sold in French trains, especially high-speed trains. In popular humour, this name refers to any bad, meagre and expensive ready-to-eat food. Since 1 March 2009, sandwiches sold onboard TGVs have become cheaper. In Greece, these kinds of sandwiches are called \\"ŒöŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒØœÉŒπŒ±\\" (karavisia) which translates roughly to \\"something that is on a ship\\", and means terrible and very expensive sandwiches like those sold on passenger ships.

As a scientist, Novakov is known for his black carbon, air quality, and climate change research. James Hansen dubbed him \\"the godfather of black carbon\\". Early life Novakov was born in Sombor, Serbia, in 1929. His father was a veterinarian and his mother was a homemaker. While in high school, Novakov began to build X-ray tubes and radios, furthering his scientific knowledge on his own. After graduating from the University of Belgrade with a PhD in nuclear physics, he taught at the University of Belgrade and worked at the Vinƒça Nuclear Institute. Novakov migrated to the United States in 1963 and began working as a research scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He later founded an Aerosol Research Group which traveled the world conducting ground breaking research on climate change. Career In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Novakov's group was the first to apply X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy to samples of atmospheric aerosols, which helped to establish the existence of a large elemental or soot fraction and provided definitive identification of physical structures similar to graphite and activated carbon in urban and remote aerosols, including in the Arctic. Following these discoveries, Novakov coined the term \\"black carbon\\" to refer to the sunlight absorbing portion of ambient particulate matter. Novakov‚Äôs aerosol research group, which included Hal Rosen, Ted Chang, Anthony Hansen, Ray Dod and Lara Gundel, developed new analytical techniques for measuring black carbon, the most notable of which is the aethalometer. The aethalometer, the name of which is derived from a Greek word that means \\"to blacken with soot\\", is today the mostly widely used instrument worldwide for measuring atmospheric concentrations of black carbon. Novakov hosted the first International Conference on Carbonaceous Particles in the Atmosphere at LBNL in 1978 to provide a forum for scientists to discuss this emerging research field. The conference series continues today alternating every few years between Berkeley and Vienna. Novakov was a distinguished member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Publications Novakov has had his work published hundreds of times in peer-reviewed journals and his work has been cited in over 6,000 articles. In October 1974, Science published \\"Sulfates as pollution particulates: catalytic formation on carbon (soot) particles\\", which Novakov co-wrote with S. G. Chang and A. B. Harker. In 1984, \\"The Aethalometer ‚Äì an instrument for the real-time measurement of optical-absorption by aersosol- particles\\", co-written with Anthony Hansen and Hal Rosen, was published in Science of the Total Environment. \\"Large contribution of organic aerosols to cloud-condensation nuclei concentrations\\", co-written with Joyce Penner, was published by Nature in 1993. \\"Evidence that the spectral dependence of light absorption by aerosols is affected by organic carbon\\", written by Thomas Kirchstetter, Novakov, and Peter Hobbs, was published in Journal of Geophysical Research in 2004. Novakov's final publication, \\"The black carbon story: early history and new perspectives\\", co-written with Rosen, was published in AMBIO in 2013. Personal life Novakov was married to Marica Cvetkoviƒá from 1954 until her death in 2014. The couple had a daughter, Anna Novakov, now an art history professor at Saint Mary's College of California. Novakov died on January 2, 2015, in Kensington, California from natural causes, aged 85.

The Azerbaijanis are believed to be inheritors of various ancient civilizations and peoples including the indigenous Caucasian Albanians, Iranian tribes such as Scythians and Alans, and Oghuz Turks among others (note that several modern peoples of the Caucasus can trace their ancestries to more than one of these same ancient peoples). The country location in the crossroads of Europe and Asia made it possible for Azeris to have military contact both with European and Oriental forces. AntiquityCaucasian Albania= Transcaucasia and Caucasian Albania (delineated by the red-dotted border). Most of Caucasian Albania is situated in present-day Azerbaijan. Caucasian Albanians are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of Azerbaijan. Early invaders included the Scythians in the 9th century BCE.Azerbaijan - US Library of Congress Country Studies (retrieved 7 June 2006). The South Caucasus was eventually conquered by the Achaemenids around 550 BCE. During this period, Zoroastrianism spread in Azerbaijan. The Achaemenids in turn were defeated by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE. Following the decline of the Seleucids in Persia in 247 BCE, an Armenian Kingdom exercised control over parts of modern Azerbaijan between 190 BCE to 428 CE.\\"Armenia-Ancient Period\\" - US Library of Congress Country Studies (retrieved 23 June 2006)Strabo, \\"Geography\\" - Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University (retrieved 24 June 2006).

Sassanid control ended with their defeat by Muslim Arabs in 642 CE.\\"Islamic Conquest.\\" Middle AgesIslamic Conquests= Caucasus region c. 740, after the end of the Second Arab‚ÄìKhazar War. The Arab‚ÄìKhazar wars saw the Caliphate gain control of Azerbaijan. Muslim Arabs defeated the Sassanids and Byzantines as they marched into the Caucasus region. The Arabs made Caucasian Albania a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by Prince Javanshir, surrendered in 667. Between the 9th and 10th centuries, Arab authors began to refer to the region between the Kura and Aras rivers as Arran. During this time, Arabs from Basra and Kufa came to Azerbaijan and seized lands that the indigenous peoples had abandoned; the Arabs became a land-owning elite.A History of Islamic Societies by Ira Lapidus, p. 48. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (1988), (retrieved 7 June 2006). Despite pockets of continued resistance, the majority of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan converted to Islam. Later on in the 10th and 11th centuries, Kurdish dynasties of Shaddadid and Rawadid ruled parts of Azerbaijan. =Shirvanshahs= Shƒ´rwƒÅn ShƒÅhBarthold, W., C.E.

Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, Columbia University, 1995, p. 2, : \\"In the fifteenth century a native Azeri state of Shirvanshahs flourished north of the Araxes.\\" and were rulers of Shirvan, a historical region in present-day Azerbaijan. The Shirvanshahs established the longest Islamic dynasty in the Islamic world. =Seljuqs and successor states= The Seljuq period of Azerbaijan's history was possibly even more pivotal than the Arab conquest as it helped shape the ethno-linguistic nationality of the modern Azerbaijani Turks. After decline of Abbasid Caliphate, the territory of Azerbaijan was under the sway of numerous dynasties such as the Salarids, Sajids, Shaddadids, Rawadids and Buyids. However at the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of Oghuz Turkic tribes emanating from Central Asia. The first of these Turkic dynasties was the Ghaznavids from northern Afghanistan, who took over part of Azerbaijan by 1030. They were followed by the Seljuqs, a western branch of the Oghuz who conquered all of Iran and the Caucasus and pressed on to Iraq where they overthrew the Buyids in Baghdad in 1055. =Safavids and the rise of Shi'a Islam= Safaviyya and Shirvanshahs forces during the Safavid conquest of Shirvan in 1501. The Safavid (Safaviyeh) were a Sufi religious order formed in 1330s by Sheikh Safi Al-Din (1252‚Äì1334), after whom it was eponymously named. This Sufi order openly converted to the heterodox branch of twelver Shi'a Islam by the end of the 15th century. Some Safavid followers, most notably the Qizilbash Turks, believed in the mystical and esoteric nature of their rulers and their relationship to the house of Ali, and thus, were zealously predisposed to fight for them. The Safavid rulers claimed to be descended from Ali himself and his wife Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, through the seventh Imam Musa al-Kazim. Qizilbash numbers increased by the 16th century and their generals were able to wage a successful war against the Ak Koyunlu state and capture Tabriz. The Safavids, led by Ismail I, expanded their base, sacking Baku in 1501 and persecuting the Shirvanshahs.  Russian rule Following their defeat by Russia in the Russo-Persian War of 1803‚Äì13, Qajar Persia was forced to sign the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813, which acknowledged the loss of the territory to Russia. Local khanates were either abolished (like in Baku or Ganja) or accepted Russian patronage. Battle of Ganja was a battle that took place in the Russo-Persian War of 1826‚Äì1828. Another Russo-Persian war in 1826-28 resulted in another crushing defeat for the Iranian army. The Russians dictated another final settlement as per the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which resulted in the Qajars of Persia ceding Caucasian territories in 1828. The treaty established the current borders of Azerbaijan and Iran as the rule of local khans ended. In the Russian-controlled territories, two provinces were established that later constituted the bulk of the modern Republic - Elisavetpol (Ganja) province in the west, and Shamakha province in the east. =Russian Civil War= Following the collapse of the Russian Empire during the Russian Civil War, the administrations in the Caucasus initially formed the Transcaucasian Commissariat in 1917. In April 1918, the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was proclaimed, which was an attempt to form a federal union with Armenia and Democratic Republic of Georgia. The federal republic would dissolve a month later, and the Azerbaijani Democratic Republic was proclaimed in Ganja on May 28, 1918. This was the first Democratic Republic established in Islamic World. Azerbaijan Democratic Republic Soldiers from the newly formed Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918. Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament of the newly formed democratic republic was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim state in the world to give women equal political rights with men. In this accomplishment, Azerbaijan preceded even such developed countries as the United Kingdom and the United States. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern- type university founded in Azerbaijan. The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918, when the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan Republic were created on June 26, 1918. First de facto Minister of Defense of ADR was Dr. Khosrov bey Sultanov. When the Ministry was formally established, Gen. Samedbey Mehmandarov became the minister, and Lt- Gen. Ali-Agha Shikhlinski his deputy. Chiefs of Staff of ADR Army were Maj- Gen. Habib Bey Salimov (August 1, 1918 - March 26, 1919), Lt-Gen. Mammad Bey Shulkevich (March 26, 1919 - December 10, 1919) and Maj-Gen. Abdulhamid Bey Gaytabashi (December 10, 1919 ‚Äì April 28, 1920).Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years Today.Az - Azerbaijan marks Day of Armed Forces Some of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic's most prestigious generals were: * Lieutenant-General Samad bey Mehmandarov (1855‚Äì1931) * Lieutenant-General, Ali-Agha Shikhlinski (1865‚Äì1943) * General-Adjutant, Huseyn Khan Nakhchivanski (1863‚Äì1919) * Major- General, Abdulhamid Bey Gaytabashi (1884‚Äì1920) * Major-General, Habib Bey Salimov (1881‚Äì1920) * Major-General, Ibrahim bey Usubov (1875‚Äì1920) * Major- General, Murad Girey Tlekhas (1874‚Äì1920) * Major-General, Emir-Kazim Mirza Qajar (1853‚Äì1920) * Major-General, Mammad Mirza Qajar (1872‚Äì1920) * Major- General, Aliyar-Bek Gashimbekow (1856‚Äì1920) * Major-General, David-Bek Edigarow (1881‚Äì1920) * Major-General, Firidun-Bey Wezirow (1850‚Äì1925) * Major- General, Khalil-Bey Talishkhanov (1859‚Äì1920) In April 1920, Soviet forces invaded Azerbaijan, leading to the dissolution of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The Red Army invaded Azerbaijan on April 28, 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh, the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 of the total 30,000 soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.Hugh Pope, \\"Sons of the conquerors: the rise of the Turkic world\\", New York: The Overlook Press, 2006, p. 116, The national Army of Azerbaijan was abolished by the Bolshevik government, 15 of the 21 army generals were executed by the Bolsheviks. = Navy = The Azerbaijani Navy was established in 1918. When the Russian Empire collapsed, ADR inherited the entire Russian Caspian flotilla. Among the vessels of the ADR were the gunboats Kars, Ardahan, Astrabad, Geok-Tepe, Arax and Bailov. The British also handed over its warship, in the Caspian Sea - a former Russian vessel, to the newly independent Azerbaijan. Soviet AzerbaijanWorld War II= In 1942, Nazi Germany launched Operation Edelweiss, in order to gain control of the Caucasus, and capture the oil fields of Baku. During World War II, Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union, much of the Soviet Union's oil on the Eastern Front was supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan was awarded orders and medals. Operation Edelweiss carried out by the German Wehrmacht targeted Baku because of its importance as a petroleum supplier of the USSR.Swietochowski, Tadeusz(1995) Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, Columbia University, p. 133. Some 800,000 Azerbaijanis fought well in the ranks of the Soviet Army of which 400,000 died and Azeri Major-General Azi Aslanov was awarded twice Hero of the Soviet Union. Mobilization affected all spheres of life. The oil workers extended their work to 12-hour shifts, with no days off, no holidays, and no vacations until the end of the war. Baku became the primary strategic goal of Hitler's 1942 Fall Blau offensive. The German army was at first stalled in the mountains of Caucasus, then decisively defeated at the Battle of Stalingrad and forced to retreat. Like the other people of the Caucasus, some Azerbaijanis joined the side of Germany. These units included: * Aserbaidschanische Legion * Freiwilligen-Stamm-Regiment 2 * Azeri Waffen SS Volunteer Formations Present republicKarabakh War= Azerbaijani soldiers during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, 1992. In summer 1992, the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan, following a resolution by the Azerbaijani president on the privatization of units and formations in Azerbaijani territory, forwarded an ultimatum demanding control over vehicles and armaments of the 135th and 139th motorized rifle regiments of the 295th Motor Rifle Division.Vladimir Petrov, How South Caucasus was armed, Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (Moscow, Russia) Azerbaijan had been the deployment area of units of the 4th Army that consisted of four motorized rifle divisions (23rd, 60th, 296th and 75th) and prescribed army units that included missile and air defense brigades and artillery and rocket regiments. It also hosted the 49th arsenal of the Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, which contained over 7,000 train-car loads of ammunition to the excess of one billion units. The transfer of the property of the 4th Army (except for part of the property of the 366th motorized rifle regiment of the 23rd division captured by Armenian armed formations in 1992 during the regiment's withdrawal from Stepanakert) and the 49th arsenal was completed in 1992. Thus, by the end of 1992, Azerbaijan received arms and military hardware sufficient for approximately four motorized rifle divisions with prescribed army units. It also inherited 50 combat aircraft from the disbanded 19th Air Defense Army and naval ships. Military situation of Nagorno-Karabakh in May 2016.

Azerbaijani sources claim that Armenian victory was largely due to military help from Russia and the wealthy Armenian diaspora, while Armenians partially deny the allegation, stating that Russia was equally supplying Armenian and Azerbaijani sides with weapons and mercenaries. During the war, Azerbaijani army was also aided by Turkish military advisers, Russian, Ukrainian, Chechen and Afghan mercenaries, although they still lost. =21st century= Soldiers from the 1st Azerbaijani Peacekeeping Company in Al Asad Airbase, during the Iraq War. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces were re-established according to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan from October 9, 1991.official web page of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Initially, the equipment and facilities of Azerbaijan's army were those of the 4th Army (Soviet Union). The Armed Forces have three branches: the Army of Azerbaijan, Air Force and Air Defence Force (a united branch), and the Azerbaijan Navy. Besides the Armed Forces there are several government paramilitary agencies that can be involved in state defence when needed. These are the Internal Troops of Azerbaijan of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and forces of the State Border Service (Azerbaijan), which includes the Coast Guard as well. The Azerbaijan National Guard is a reserve component of the Azerbaijan Army. It operates as a semi-independent entity of the Azerbaijan Defense Department. The current Defense Minister is colonel- general Safar Abiyev, and the Chief of Staff is colonel-general Najmaddin Sadykhov. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan has been trying to further develop its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. Since 2005 Azerbaijan has increased its military budget to $2.46 billion in 2009.Military budget reaches $2 billion Based on the 2008 statistics the country has over 600 Main Battle Tanks, 900 Armored Combat Vehicles and over 720 Artillery Systems. Its air force has about 106 aircraft and 35 helicopters. Azerbaijan has its own Defense Industry, which manufactures small arms and military aircraft. There are hopes to produce other military equipment. Azerbaijan joined the multi-national force during the Iraq War, and from 2006 to 2008 sent troops to the northern parts of Iraq. It provided 250 troops. One hundred soldiers were sent on December 29, 2004 to reinforce the 150 soldiers already in the country. They provided security for local Turkmen people, religious sites and convoys. Troops from Azerbaijan serve with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

It focuses on defending and promoting the private equity and growth capital investment industry to lawmakers and the public at large. Its members include some of the world's largest private equity firms. HistoryFounding and early history= The concept for a trade association for the private equity industry originated in 2006, as the private equity market reached the peak of its mid-2000s buyout boom and it became the subject of increased criticism and government scrutiny. That year, private equity firms were involved in around 28% of acquisitions by dollar value, compared to 3% in 2001. In late 2006, the Private Equity Council (PEC) was formed as the industry's principal lobbying organization. The trade association was officially launched in Washington, D.C., in February 2007. The original Private Equity Council logo in use from the formation of the organization through September 2010The AIC provides research on issues including the impact of private equity on job creation and pension funds' returns in order to educate business leaders, policymakers, the media, and labor organizations about the private equity industry. In addition to its research and communications endeavors, the Council's mission also includes advocacy on behalf of private equity firms and the growth capital investment industry. =Expansion and renaming= In 2010, the PEC expanded its membership to include a broader selection of private equity industry stakeholders. In September 2010, eighteen new members were added, including middle-market private equity firms and growth capital investment firms. Following this expansion, the PEC changed its name to the Private Equity Growth Capital Council (PEGCC) to reflect a broader membership. According to the Council, in addition to the name change it created a committee called the \\"Growth Capital Committee\\" to focus specifically on issues related to middle and small market firms. In 2016, the PEGCC changed its name to the American Investment Council to \\"reflect the increased diversity of PE firms and growing focus of the industry.\\" =Member firms= The AIC's members include some of the largest private equity firms globally, along with an Associate Member class of advisory and law firms that have a private equity practice. A full list of members can be found on the AIC's website. Activities Since its launch in 2007, the AIC has spent over $11 million on lobbying. It also commissions and publicizes research favorable to the private equity industry. In addition to its research and lobbying activities, the trade association has developed best practice guidelines. In 2009, it developed a set of \\"guidelines for responsible investment\\", which were adopted by its members, covering such issues as health, safety, labor, governance, transparency for stakeholders and respect for human rights. The guidelines were produced in accordance with the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), from discussions between AIC members and a group of institutional investors. The guidelines focus on transparency of private equity transactions and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, both in the United States and overseas, and encourage adding value to members' portfolio companies. The AIC received positive feedback on its guidelines from PRI executive director James Gifford, and the chief investment officers of California Public Employees Retirement Systems (CalPERS) and California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), but the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) remained critical of the industry, arguing that outside regulation was needed rather than internal guidelines. In 2016, the AIC, in partnership with the National Association of Investment Companies, launched The Private Equity Women‚Äôs Initiative. The initiative promotes the recruitment and retention of women in private equity industry. Through this initiative, AIC membership promotes Guidelines and Best Practices for better gender parity in private equity. Studies and reports The AIC releases quarterly and annual reports that highlight fundraising and investment trends, measure PE performance, and analyze top states and districts for investments. These reports share the impact that private equity has across the country. = Top States and Districts Report = In 2011, the AIC released its first Top States and Districts report, a ranking of the top 20 states and Congressional districts receiving the most private equity investment and that have the most private equity-backed companies. The report features an interactive map on the AIC's website that allows visitors to find out information about private equity investment in every state, including data about pension funds. Thomson Reuters and propriety data collected by the AIC provide data for the report. = Other reports = In early 2007 the private equity industry was criticized by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which argued that the industry put employees at risk of job loss and had a negative impact on job creation. In response to this criticism, the AIC commissioned a number of studies and reports. In September 2007, an AIC report detailed three case studies of private equity owned companies that became more competitive and increased employment following their buyout. The following January, a study for the Council by Robert J. Shapiro and economist Nam Pham found that 76% of companies owned by eight private equity firms reported an increase in jobs. The study observed \\"significantly greater job gains\\" in private equity transactions compared with the overall market. In 2010 an AIC report found that portfolio companies outperform publicly owned companies by 7% over three years and 11% over five years, countering claims that private equity has a negative impact operational improvement. Other reports commissioned by the Council include a plan to improve the U.S. economy, produced by economists Martin Neil Baily and Matthew Slaughter, and a report estimating the total employment by private equity owned companies to be 11 million people. Pensions & Investments magazine stated that this was the first time that employment by the industry had been quantified. Legislation and regulation The AIC has advocated before Congress in support of the private equity industry on numerous occasions. In 2009, the then-president of the PEC, Douglas Lowenstein, testified before the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) in support of legislation requiring private equity and hedge funds to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He stated that the PEC supported registration under the proposed Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act because its members perceived the law as an important component of protection for investors against systemic risk. While supporting registration, Lowenstein raised concerns regarding cost for smaller firms. The AIC has testified before Congress on the industry's role in the economy. In 2007, Lowenstein testified before the HFSC on the impact of private equity on employment and companies. In 2009, its chairman Mark Tresnowski testified before the Senate Banking Subcommittee on the potential role of private equity in the recovery of the U.S. economy. The AIC's initial lobbying efforts were focused on opposing proposed legislation to increase taxation of private equity managers' fees. The AIC supported keeping the carried interest tax on managers' fees at the 15 percent capital gains rate, rather than increasing it to the earned income rate. The proposed legislation was rejected but similar proposals were raised in 2009 and 2011, and the AIC continued to oppose them. =Lobbying disclosures= As required by the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 and Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, the Council is a registered lobbying organization and files quarterly reports concerning these activities, including the amount of money spent specifically on lobbying.

(born April 23, 1949) is a former Los Angeles prosecuting attorney. She is best known as the adjudicator of the courtroom series Divorce Court for seven seasons from the 1999‚Äì2006 season. She was replaced by Lynn Toler in the show's 2006-07 season. Ephriam is also known for her judge roles in Tyler Perry's Madea films. Ephriam returned to television in fall 2014 with a new courtroom series titled after her, Justice with Judge Mablean. The series, produced by Entertainment Studios, is airing on the Justice Central cable channel and syndicated on various stations. It is the fifth courtroom series from Entertainment Studios. Her daughter is writer/director/producer Tajamika Paxton. Legal background Ephriam was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi but raised in Los Angeles, California, from the age of six. Although she had never actually served as a judge before presiding on Divorce Court, she came to the series with significant legal experience and knowledge of the law. She started her law career as a corrections officer in the Women's Division of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. She attended night classes at Whittier Law School where she earned her Juris Doctor degree in 1978. In 1982, she opened her own law practice, dealing mainly with personal injury and family law cases. She soon became a Los Angeles Prosecuting Attorney. Entertainment judgeDivorce Court 1999-2006= In 1999, Divorce Court was revived and Ephriam was selected to be the show's arbitrator. She was the first star of the reality-based version of The Divorce Court. Previous to that, the show used dramatic reenactments of real-life divorce cases. She was also the first African American and female to preside over the series. While presiding over Divorce Court, Ephriam was noted for her humor. Her audience was frequently brought to laughter by Ephriam's striking and quirky voice and reactions of appall and bewilderment by the ex- couple's outrageous and absurd behaviors. Ephriam's trademark phrase on Divorce Court was \\"Look deep before you leap,\\" advising would-be newlyweds to examine each other's behaviors and attitudes carefully before they decide to marry. While Ephriam encouraged her litigants to discuss sensitive issues to get to the heart of what was causing their divorce, she was quick to restore order in her courtroom when things got out of hand, and she scolded her litigants for disrespectful behavior towards herself and each other in court. In March 2006, it was announced that Ephriam would leave Divorce Court at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season (her seventh behind the bench), reportedly because she and the show's producers were unable to come to an agreement on a contract extension. She was replaced by Judge Lynn Toler, a former judge from Cleveland Heights, Ohio, who formerly presided over the short-lived syndicated courtroom TV show Power of Attorney. =Madea films= Well known as Madea's court judge, Ephraim portrays a strict and stern judge character in Madea films, who frequently presides over the many cases Madea lands herself into, always as result of violent and destructive conduct. The judge never sentences Madea to prison, instead she gives Madea unflattering though less severe punishments such as house arrest, becoming foster mother to a wayward teen (played by Keke Palmer) and going to therapy sessions with Doctor Phil. Ephriam made a short appearance in the film adaptation of the play Diary of a Mad Black Woman. She also portrayed the same judge character in both Madea's Family Reunion and Madea Goes to Jail. As a judge, her first name is pronounced \\"may-BLENE,\\" as in the Chuck Berry song \\"Maybellene.\\" =Justice with Judge Mablean= In the fall of 2014, Ephriam returned to TV with a new court room series, produced by Entertainment Studios. Airing in syndication and ES's Justice Central network, it is the fifth courtroom series from Entertainment Studios. Episodes are filmed in Culver City, CA. Other projects Ephriam hosted an annual event on Father's Day called The H.U.F. Awards, where she leads a star-studded community celebration of otherwise unsung fathers. In June 2010, Ephriam expressed joy and appreciation for the event on The Jazz Joy and Roy syndicated radio show. > ... I would love to get some more money to do what I really want to do, but > just putting on this brunch for the fathers and allowing them to have a > really wonderful Fathers Day, to share in the joy of good music and good > food and good entertainment and being out with family, and all of us making > a fuss over them, which doesn't happen for most of the fathers ...

Designed by Daigo Ikeno for Capcom's development team, he first appeared in the arcade version of Street Fighter IV and later in related promotions and media for the title. A very large, overweight martial artist, Rufus seeks to defeat Ken Masters, angered by his claim of being the \\"number one fighter in America\\". Along the way he instead fights many people he confuses for Ken due to similar attire or hair color, regardless of gender. The character is voiced by Wataru Hatano in Japanese, and Christopher Corey Smith in English. Since Rufus's introduction, the character has received a mostly positive reception. Though some criticism has been made over the character's design and aesthetic, the majority have praised the character as exceeding expectations based solely on his appearance. Character design Ken. While previous Street Fighter titles relied almost solely on Capcom's Research and Development branch, the development team instead allowed other branches of the company to give input on the design of new characters, due to the influx of fan requests from outside Japan. Rufus was designed based upon marketing research on what sorts of characters an American audience would enjoy playing, and was one of several characters considered for inclusion during the game's development. Designed by Daigo Ikeno, Rufus was initially intended to be a bald slender black male wearing a gi named \\"King Cobra\\", meant to be a more acrobatic counterpart to series characters Ryu and Ken and voiced by Wataru Hatano. His fighting style was intended to be \\"breakung-fu\\", mixing elements of Chinese martial arts with breakdancing, which they perceived as a fad in the United States at the time, and Ikeno developed the character's concept around it. Midway through the process of recording the character's lines, however, art director Takashi Kamei proposed that they have the character be overweight, an idea Ikeno agreed with. As a result, the design was gradually changed completely, becoming more obese and turned into a blonde, long haired white male, a design which Ikeno later admitted was in fact rushed. The changed appearance surprised many of Capcom's staff members, including Hatano, who remarked \\"Wait, is that my character?\\" Rufus final appearance was chosen over his initial design because the developers felt he would \\"freak people out\\". Street Fighter IVs executive producer Yoshinori Ono likened his inclusion to that of Blanka in Street Fighter II, noting that Rufus' \\"over-the-top\\" design was intended to help set the game apart from the \\"really cool-looking but ultimately bland\\" characters of Tekken and Virtua Fighter. In an interview, Ono noted they made Rufus intentionally silly, adding that he could be called an \\"American Dan\\" in terms of being a joke character in the game's roster. He later referred to Rufus as \\"quite grotesque to look at\\" when describing the new characters for the game. When asked about comparisons between Rufus and Bob, a character introduced by Namco for their Tekken series around the same time, Ono emphasized that the characters were different in many regards, and while Bob represented a \\"cool fat guy\\", Rufus represented a \\"weird fat guy\\". Other Capcom staff members including community manager Seth Killian have received the character warmly, noting Rufus as their favorite new character in the series. Street Fighter IV sound director Masayuki Endou developed the character's musical theme for the title with a \\"freewheeling spirit\\" in mind due to Rufus's motorcycle and personality, utilizing an American drummer and drum set for parts of the theme. Feeling it would be an interesting approach, Hatano's recorded voice samples to be incorporated into the character's background music. The development team agreed, feeling that his voice gave the character presence and fit Rufus' overall image. =Personality and attributes= Rufus is an American motorcycle repair shop mechanic. Using a self-taught fighting style from watching martial arts films and putting his own spin on the attacks, he believes he is handsome and America's best martial artist. Rufus takes himself very seriously in this regard, to the point of referring to himself as \\"Lord Rufus\\" and regarding rude people as beneath him. Capcom describes the character as having a hasty personality, prone to jumping to conclusions to achieve a goal and sacrificing accuracy for speed.Famitsu staff (June 2008). \\"Street Fighter IV\\". Famitsu (in Japanese). Rufus tends to speak in a long-winded manner, demonstrated through considerably long victory quotes at the end of fights. His girlfriend, Candy, accompanies him as a result of him protecting her from an angry waiter she attempted to bilk and paying the bill. Rufus is depicted as a large, heavily obese blond male. His head is mostly bald, with a long braided ponytail jutting from the top, and a mustache extending down the sides of his mouth to his chin. His clothing consists of a yellow and black sleeveless jumpsuit with padded shoulders, with the closing straps left open due to his girth and exposing the center of his torso and lower abdominal hair. Black shoes cover his feet, while black fingerless gloves cover his hands and most of his forearms. His secondary outfit is similar, changing the jumpsuit to a dark blue and green version with sleeves and a raised collar, additionally removing the gloves and changing his hairstyle to a double ponytail. Other alternate designs were considered but rejected, amongst which included an Elvis impersonator appearance and martial artist attire. Rufus stands tall, and weighs . For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit intended to resemble the Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending from the front of the hat and over his face. The developers considered to have the charm able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well. Appearances Introduced in the 2008 video game Street Fighter IV, Rufus is angered that martial artist Ken Masters is declared the best fighter in America. Per Candy's suggestion that he find and defeat Ken to prove himself as the best, he declares Ken as his rival and sets out to find him. However, along the way he repeatedly mistakes other fighters for Ken, attacking similarly dressed or blonde people regardless of gender, and blames the mistaken identities on his belief Ken is using decoys to delay him, notably, the character Abel. He eventually confronts Ken, who states he does not know who Rufus is, which angers him further before they fight. In the game's conclusion, Rufus is shown pushing his broken down motorcycle uphill with Candy on board, using it as training and blaming Ken for the predicament. At the conclusion of Super Street Fighter IV, Rufus repairs his motorcycle and at Candy's request for a colder climate, heads due north to the North Pole. Rufus appears with his official tag partner, Zangief in Street Fighter X Tekken. Outside of the video game, Rufus has also appeared in UDON's Street Fighter comic series. First appearing in their Street Fighter II Turbo comic in February 2009, Rufus is shown to hate Ken for being named the best fighter in America as well as for the media attention he receives, feeling Ken put no effort into the achievement. Taking Candy along with him, Rufus sets out to find and defeat Ken at the story's conclusion. Later appearing in the second issue of UDON's Street Fighter IV comic book, Rufus attempts to find him through his friend Sakura Kasugano, defeating Dan Hibiki in the process but is himself defeated afterwards. =Gameplay= Rufus was purposefully made faster than his outward appearance would indicate and given the ability to string his attacks together more readily, in order to \\"[defy] expectations based on what he looks like\\", and to contrast against other large characters in fighting games. During development of his attacks, the developers devised several options for his fighting style, considering different ways to combine it with his appearance. After considering his design, they decided to allow his movements to be quick and strengthened by the inertia of his body fat, accompanied by martial artist yells and shouts. Rufus's gameplay has been compared to the fighting styles used by Street Fighter III characters Yun and Yang by the development team, notably in regards to his diving kick attack, and emphasized mobility while attacking. Other attacks were designed as a means to negate enemy offensives, such as the Galactic Tornado, which destroys enemy projectiles while drawing the opponent closer to Rufus for a final strike. His Ultra Combo, Space Opera Symphony, is a barrage of attacks that requires close proximity to the opponent, dealing several blows and ending in a final upwards blast. In Super Street Fighter IV, a second Ultra Combo named \\"Big Bang Typhoon\\" was added, consisting of Rufus spinning his body with arms outward in a tornado-inspired fashion. The attack was designed to have deceptive range, but a long startup period. This in turn gave the development team trouble and relied on a lot of \\"trial and error\\" to balance the character. Promotion and reception To promote Street Fighter IV and the character, artwork of Rufus including hand-drawn sprites of the character is included in Xbox Live themes. Worldwide restaurants Wan Zhu Ji and Benitora Gyoza Bo offered four Street Fighter IV themed meals, which included a nimono meat dish named after the character. At organized events, Capcom distributed a limited series of Street Fighter IV cards to promote the arcade title, one of which features Rufus in a fighting stance. Rufus has received mixed to positive reception since his debut. GameDaily named Rufus the strangest of the new characters introduced in Street Fighter IV, placing him 12th on their \\"Most Bizarre Fighting Characters\\" list and noting his high attack speed despite his weight. IGN described Rufus as one of the most interesting new characters introduced in the title, due to the \\"juxtaposition between his comical size and impressive speed\\" and added that his attack set \\"shows that if you can get past Rufus' comical exterior, a capable fighter hides within.\\" IGN AU stated that while they felt the character was the ugliest in the game, they enjoyed his unpredictability and acrobatics, as well as his attitude. 1UP.com called Rufus a worthy addition to the series, \\"despite...outward, me- too appearances\\". Anime News Network described Rufus as well-designed and engaging, despite initial reservations regarding the character. VideoGamer.com praised Rufus as one of the game's better new characters in the title, in heavy contrast to other additions such as Crimson Viper. GameTrailers praised the character and noted he \\"definitely offered something different\\", adding \\"You may not have expected a game's most obvious jiggle physics to apply to a male character.\\" Stars and Stripes noted the level of detail in Rufus's animations and movements, describing his mobility as \\"weirdly awesome\\". In contrast, Doug Buel of The Tampa Tribune considered Rufus a character the game could have done without, describing him as \\"an obnoxious, overweight fighter with a big mouth\\", additionally citing the character as the game's worst feature. GameSpot described him as \\"a bit of a sight gag\\", though noting his speed as \\"deceptive\\". A reviewer for the New Straits Times felt that though the character stood out from the other newcomers, his play was too \\"lethargic\\".

The community began in 1915, when it was founded by Margaret Cope (1886‚Äì1961) at the Mother House of St. Hilda's Priory, Sneaton Castle, Whitby.The Whitby Sisters: A Chronicle of the Order of the Holy Paraclete 1915‚Äì2000, by OHP and Rosalin Barker, pub 2001, History Mother Margaret was a Novice with the Community of St Peter, Horbury, in 1914, when the announcement of the Great War meant that the Sisters decided to close St Hilda's School, the high school for girls which they had been running. While on rest at Rievaulx Abbey, she was inspired by the Holy Spirit to found a new educational Order, to continue the school. In January 1915, St Hilda's School re-opened at Sneaton Castle, Whitby, and the new Order was provisionally named The Society of the Holy Spirit. The Archbishop of York at the time was Dr Cosmo Gordon Lang, who in July 1915 appointed Dr Walter Frere of the Community of the Resurrection as adviser to the Order. Fr Frere advised that there was already in existence in the USA an Order called The Society of the Holy Spirit, and suggested The Order of the Holy Paraclete. The Rule and Constitution of the Order were formally accepted by Archbishop Lang by August 1917. The First Professions of the Order took place on 16 October 1917, followed by the first formal meeting of the Chapter, at which Fr Frere resigned as Spiritual Adviser and at which Mother Margaret was officially elected as the first Prioress of the Order. The installation of Mother Margaret as Prioress took place on the same day. In 1919, the Order acquired a resident Chaplain, Rev G Healey, allowing for regular services in Chapel. This encouraged the building of a proper Chapel, as the room which was being used for this purpose is found at the top of the South Tower, accessible only by a stone spiral staircase. (The Chapel built at this time is now the refectory in the Sneaton Castle Centre.) This was the first of a number of building projects to extend the available space for both Sisters and pupils. The Sisters who were in First Vows took their Life Professions on 2 July 1921. The Rule and Constitution of the Order were finalised and authorised by the ecclesiastical authority of Archbishop William Temple in January 1930. Mother Margaret had sought help from Fr Lucius Carey of the Society of St. John the Evangelist in finalising the legal document of the Constitution. The Order first took on work outside of St Hilda's School in 1924. In 1926, the first Sisters travelled to the Gold Coast (Ghana), which was the start of the Order's work in Africa.Fulfilled in Joy: The Order of the Holy Paraclete and its Foundress Mother Margaret, by A Foundation Member, pub 1964 Hodder & Stoughton The Priory is named after St. Hilda of Whitby, the patron saint of Whitby, who founded a monastery on the east cliff in 657. The Order also has houses elsewhere in Yorkshire, with Sisters in York and Redcar as well as St. Oswald's Pastoral Centre in Sleights, near Whitby. The community describes itself as \\"active and contemplative\\", and follows the Benedictine tradition, following a regular pattern of monastic worship. The community has pioneered educational and medical work in Ghana from as early as 1926 and continues to do so today.

It is also a basic principle that guides modern research in perception. The ideal observer is a theoretical system that performs a specific task in an optimal way. If there is uncertainty in the task, then perfect performance is impossible and the ideal observer will make errors. Ideal performance is the theoretical upper limit of performance. It is theoretically impossible for a real system to perform better than ideal. Typically, real systems are only capable of sub-ideal performance. This technique is useful for analyzing psychophysical data (see psychophysics). Definition Many definitions of this term have been offered. Geisler (2003) (slightly reworded): The central concept in ideal observer analysis is the ideal observer, a theoretical device that performs a given task in an optimal fashion given the available information and some specified constraints. This is not to say that ideal observers perform without error, but rather that they perform at the physical limit of what is possible in the situation. The fundamental role of uncertainty and noise implies that ideal observers must be defined in probabilistic (statistical) terms. Ideal observer analysis involves determining the performance of the ideal observer in a given task and then comparing its performance to that of a real perceptual system, which (depending on the application) might be the system as a whole, a subsystem, or an elementary component of the system (e.g. a neuron). Sequential ideal observer analysis In sequential ideal observer analysis, the goal is to measure a real system's performance deficit (relative to ideal) at different processing stages. Such an approach is useful when studying systems that process information in discrete (or semi-discrete) stages or modules. Natural and pseudo-natural tasks To facilitate experimental design in the laboratory, an artificial task may be designed so that the system's performance in the task may be studied. If the task is too artificial, the system may be pushed away from a natural mode of operation. Depending on the goals of the experiment, this may diminish its external validity. In such cases, it may be important to keep the system operating naturally (or almost naturally) by designing a pseudo-natural task. Such tasks are still artificial, but they attempt to mimic the natural demands placed on a system. For example, the task might employ stimuli that resemble natural scenes and might test the system's ability to make potentially useful judgments about these stimuli. Natural scene statistics are the basis for calculating ideal performance in natural and pseudo-natural tasks. This calculation tends to incorporate elements of signal detection theory, information theory, or estimation theory.

In 1757 Michael Jarweh converted to Catholicism and took with him a large number of his congregants. On July 21, 1781, his Syriac Orthodox predecessor Patriarch George IV died, and the bishops (five bishops were present), clergy and laity met in the Dayr al-Zafaran monastery and elected Ignatius Michael III Jarweh as Patriarch; he accepted only after the reading and the approval of a Catholic declaration of faith in the Church of the Forty Martyrs, Mardin. He was enthroned in Mor Hananyo Monastery on 22 January 1783 and took the traditional name of Ignatius III. His election was confirmed by the Pope on September 14, 1783, and he received the Pallium, the sign of patriarchal authority, on December 15 of the same year. The Syrian Catholic Church once again had a Patriarch. Two Syriac bishops opposed his election: two days after Michael's enthronement they took the money of the monastery and paid a group of Kurds who attacked Mardin, making fatalities: Michael survived, but lost many days. In the meantime one of these two Syirac Orthodox bishops, Mar Matta ben Abdel-Ahad Saalab, bishop of Mosul, consecrated to bishop four of his monks in order to hold a second election and thus he was elected Syriac Orthodox patriarch. This party arrived at Istanbul before Michael's envoy, and received the formal approval of the Ottoman authorities, and could thus continue a parallel Syriac Orthodox tradition. LifeBishop of Aleppo= Michael Jarweh was born on January 3, 1731 in Aleppo. He spent some time as deacon in Edessa and in 1757 he was ordained a priest by the Syrian bishop of Aleppo, George Fattal, who also appointed him as procurator of the church of Aleppo. He was distinguished for his sermons and for his concern for the poor. In those years Michael came in contact with the Melkite Archbishop Ignatius Karbousse of Aleppo. He also was on good terms with the Jesuit missionaries, who were respectful of the Oriental traditions, while he always had difficulties with the Franciscan missionaries, more inclined to ask for latinization. In November 1757 Michael made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and from that time he was a Catholic at heart. A few years later Michael Jarweh decided to visit the Syriac Patriarch Ignatius George III in Amid and to explain to him his belief in union with Rome. He did not succeed in persuading the Patriarch to enter into communion with the Catholic Church, but Michael impressed the Patriarch so much that he was appointed bishop of Aleppo, being consecrated in the Church of Our Lady in Amid on February 23, 1766 by the Patriarch himself. A short time after Michael Jarweh returned to Aleppo, the Patriarch died and the new Patriarch, Ignatius George IV, was strongly opposed to any relations with the Catholic Church. He summoned Michael to visit him with a letter dated January 5, 1769. Thus Michael reached the Patriarch's abode, the Dayr al-Zafaran monastery, where he tried to persuade the Patriarch about his faith, with the only result being his imprisonment for four years in the monastery. In 1772, while Michael was being forcibly kept in the monastery, the Patriarch denounced and made imprisoned other pro-Catholics in Aleppo. They were released by the Ottoman authorities only after the payment of a large ransom. Early in 1773, these believers met in the Church of Our Lady in Aleppo and wrote a letter to Rome asking for communion. Michael Jarweh escaped from the Dayr al-Zafaran monastery only a year later, and on December 8, 1774 he reached his flock in Aleppo. On December 16, 1774 Michael made a profession of faith in front of the Melkite Archbishop Karbousse and wrote to Rome. Because of some contrary reports of both the Franciscan missionaries and of the Catholic delegate for the Syrians Joseph Kodsi, Rome took some time to take a decision in favor of Michael, but on June 23, 1775 Pope Pius VI recognized Michael as a true Catholic and as bishop of Aleppo. In Aleppo, Michael continued to be the object of attacks from the traditionalists, who according to Ottoman Law also had civil authority over him, and he had to escape to Cyprus and later to Egypt. Having returned to Aleppo, he went on persuading, with success, bishops and believers about his idea of full communion with the Catholic Church. =Patriarch= Dayr al-Zafaran monastery On July 21, 1781, Patriarch George IV died, and the bishops (five bishops were present), clergy and laity met in the Dayr al-Zafaran monastery and elected him as Patriarch; he accepted only after the reading and the approval of a Catholic declaration of faith in the church of the Forty Martyrs. He was enthroned in Dayr al-Zafaran monastery on January 22, 1783 and took the traditional name of Ignatius III. His election was confirmed by the Pope on September 14, 1783, and he received the Pallium, the sign of patriarchal authority, on December 15 of the same year. The Syrian Catholic Church once again had a Patriarch, having lacked one since the death in 1702 of Ignatius Gregory Peter VI Shahbaddin. Two bishops opposed his election: two days after Michael's enthronement they took the money of the monastery and paid a group of Kurds who attacked Mardin making fatalities: Michael saved himself, but lost many days. In the meantime one of these two Orthodox bishops, Mar Matta ben Abdel-Ahad Saalab bishop of Mosul, consecrated bishop four of his monks in order to hold a second election and thus he was elected patriarch. This party arrived at Istanbul before Michael's envoy, and received the formal approval of the Ottoman authorities: thus Michael became an outlaw and was imprisoned. After the payment of a ransom, Michael moved to Baghdad, waiting for the appeal, and later escaped from Baghdad disguised as Bedouin. He arrived in Lebanon having lost everything, and went to live in the ruins of the Kesroan monastery. Helped by the Maronites, and with some funds raised in Europe, Michael Jarweh bought on September 22, 1786 the Al-Charfet (or Sharfeh) monastery on Mount Lebanon that he dedicated to Our Lady of Deliverance. This monastery was used as a seminary for the education of new priests and a large library was set up. On September 19, 1791 the patriarchal See was moved from Mardin to Al-Charfet; it is still used as the summer abode of the Syrian Catholic Patriarch. Lebanon granted a certain security, but the majority of believers lived far away, mainly in the areas of Aleppo and Mosul. Michael Jarweh died on September 4,or September 14 according to the Gregorian Calendar adopted in 1836 by the Syriac Catholic Church 1800\\\\.

It was ported a year later to the Sega Mega Drive by Taito Corporation, while being renamed Fire Mustang. NMK Co. Ltd. also developed the Sega Mega Drive version. The game is a very standard horizontal scrolling shoot em' up with only one type of available weapon and a bomb weapon. Players took on a fictional campaign in a World War II setting as a USAAF fighter pilot in a titular North American P-51 Mustang against the Nazi Luftwaffe and the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service. Gameplay Players were sent around stages in Europe and Asia against either of the two featured Axis powers. Every level was filled with a wide variety of different fighter craft and ground forces that all preceded the end-level boss (generally a large aircraft). Eight levels in all; the game repeats endlessly thereafter. Players had a typical vulcan weapon that could be upgraded three times in order for the shot pattern to widen. Players also had an unlimited amount of ground force bombs that would increase in firing speed with the vulcan. The player's bomb weapon was a weapon called \\"The Forcer\\" that fired a large fireball straight forward. While the arcade original featured a second player to join in, the 2 player addition was removed from the Mega Drive port. A bootleg version of the game exists and it uses musics from Seibu Kaihatsu's Raiden. Historical Inaccuracies Despite the game's setting, certain liberties are taken from real life as well as anachronisms. *The first mission takes place in 1940, near Spain, but Spain was a neutral country and never joined the Axis and the United States had not joined World War II until December 1941. *The final enemy of the second stage is a Japanese cruise missile submarine. Neither the Imperial Japanese Navy, nor other navies ‚Äì besides some experiments done by the Germans with their Uboats ‚Äì had by then that kind of vessels. *P-51 Mustangs were not available until late 1943 and neither were the Dornier Do 335 fighter planes first encountered in the first level (flying in a rectangular formation) which was not issued or used by the Luftwaffe until mid-1944, and the Japanese Shin-Den, featured as enemies in the second stage, of which just two prototypes were built and never saw actual combat. *The most obvious, but more excusable, inaccuracies include the Vulcan and Forcer weapons as well as the enemy ground force's use of homing missiles; most of which were used for the sake of arcade game challenge and presentation.

It consists of steel links held together by rivets, and superficially resembles the bicycle-style roller chain, although it is closer in design to a leaf chain. Its key differences are sharp cutting teeth on the outside of the chain loop, and flat drive links on the inside, to retain the chain on the saw's bar and allow propulsion by the engine or motor. Saw chains (and chainsaws generally) are used for cutting wood. This may be for harvesting trees for pulp or timber, for tree surgery, or for processing firewood. Whether for hand-held chainsaws, mechanical timber harvesters or chain mortisers, the saw chain has undergone dramatic development since its invention. Modern chains designed for high power, high-speed sawing applications will vastly outperform older designs, while allowing a far greater degree of safety and reliability in use. Principles of saw chain operation Saw chains operate by being propelled around a guide bar, removing material from the kerf by cutting chips from the side and bottom. In order to operate properly, the depth to which each tooth cuts must be limited to avoid it binding in the wood. Scratcher chain, like the teeth on a hand saw, simply uses a multitude of teeth to prevent individual teeth from sinking too far in without undue pressure on the bar. Chipper chain, and all subsequent designs, incorporate a depth gauge (also known as a \\"raker\\"http://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdfpubs/pdf06672805/ch03.pdf) on each cutter link to limit depth of cut on each tooth. This has two distinct advantages over scratcher chain - it enables the use of fewer cutters per unit length of chain, which allows for shorter downtime for sharpening, and produces a more \\"open\\" chain layout, allowing far better clearance of chips and debris from the kerf. Individual depth gauges on each tooth also enable the use of skip chain. Skip or semi-skip chain has a further reduction in the number of teeth and is used for applications where much debris is produced, such as ripping or cross-cutting very large sections of wood. Skip chain also absorbs less power from the motor per unit length of chain than full- complement chain, allowing the use of a longer bar/chain combination on any given motor. Early saw chain designs Scratcher teeth = A section of \\"scratcher\\" chain on a bar nose, showing the tooth layout. A section of \\"scratcher\\" chain showing the large number of teeth compared to modern chain. Very early chainsaws used tooth configurations very similar to conventional hand saws. These were very simple saw teeth following a wave pattern (left, centre, right, centre) with no depth gauges as such, relying purely on bar pressure to limit the cutting rate. They were inefficient and slow in use, and were soon superseded by chipper chain. They required great skill and a lot of time to sharpen in the field leading to extended downtime between sessions. = Chipper teeth = Oregon (brand) no.10 chipper chain, note the long curve between the top and side plates. Chipper chain invented by Joseph Cox improved dramatically on the performance of scratcher chain. Chipper used a tooth that was curled over the top of the chain, with alternate teeth pointing left and right. Ahead of the tooth was a depth gauge, which allowed for good clearance around the tooth for chip clearing while limiting the depth of cut and preventing grabbing or overloading. Chipper chains are sometimes used for dirty work, since their very large working corner allows the cutter to retain its effective sharpness for a long time in abrasive conditions.  Modern tooth designs  Modern Cutting Teeth = Full-chisel chain Modern chains for general use in forestry, tree surgery and firewood cutting come in three basic configurations: the full chisel, the semi-chisel, and the chipper chain. Full chisel saw chains The full chisel chain has square-cornered teeth, splitting wood fibers easily in the cut for fast, efficient cutting in clean softwood. Chisel chains have a high kick-back risk due to missing safety chain elements and are more sensitive against dirt. These chains are available for semi-pro (also called pro-sumer) and professional saws. Semi-chisel saw chains The semi-chisel chain has teeth with rounded corners formed by a radius between the top and side plates. While slower than full chisel in softwood, it retains an acceptable cutting sharpness longer, making it the preferred choice for dirtier wood, hard or dry wood, frozen wood or stump work, all of which would rapidly degrade full chisel chain. Variation of the semi-chisel chain is \\"Chamfer chisel\\" chains made by Oregon. They are similar to semi-chisel design but have a small 45 degree chamfer between the plates rather than a radius. Performance is similar to good semi-chisel. Semi chisel chains have a lower kick-back risk. These chains are available for consumer, semi-pro and professional saws. Low-profile chains Low-profile chains are chains with low teeth and safety elements between teeth. These chains are used on consumer saws for non-experienced operators. These chains are more insensitive against dirt, but require more frequent sharpening. Chipper chains The chipper chain is similar to the semi-chisel chain. The key differences between are the size of the radius at the working corner. In cross-section a chipper tooth looks like a question mark, having a full radius over the whole cutting portion of the tooth, whereas a semi chisel design is more like a number \\"7\\" with the top-right corner slightly rounded.  Chain arrangements  There are also different arrangements of teeth on the chain. Full Complement chain Chain has a left cutter, drive link, right cutter, drive link arrangement and is used for most applications. Skip chain Has a left cutter, drive link, drive link, right cutter arrangement. It has 1/3 fewer cutting teeth and is generally used on long bars (24\\"+) for added chip clearance or when a bar longer than ideal for a given power head is used. Fewer teeth require less power to operate. Semi-Skip chain Alternates having one or two drive links between pairs of cutters, for performance in between that of full complement and skip arrangements. The terms used to describe chain arrangements can be confusing. Most modern chains do not have only cutter teeth and drive links. There are tie straps which separate the cutters from each other.  Chain specifications and dimensioning  Cutting chain comes in a large number of configurations, but these are reduced to a few key dimensions for replacement or specification purposes. Gauge The gauge of the chain is the thickness of the drive links, and is dictated by the gauge of the bar on which it is to be run. Usual gauges are 0.043\\" (1.1 mm), .050\\" (1.3 mm), .058\\" (1.5 mm), and .063\\" (1.6 mm). Chain and bar gauge must match; a chain that is too large will not fit, one that is too small will fall sideways and cut poorly. Pitch The pitch of the chain is the average distance between two rivets. As the distance between rivets varies, the pitch can be measured by measuring between three rivets and dividing this distance by two. Typical pitches are 0.325\\", 3/8\\" (0.375) and 0.404\\". The 3/4\\" pitch is used for harvester applications, and very rarely for handheld cutting. The pitch of the chain must match the drive sprocket, and the nose sprocket (if fitted). Sprocket and rim can be in one unit or separated. Length A chain loop must be of an appropriate length in order to run safely. This is described by the number of drive links. This number is determined by the length and type of bar, the sprocket size and the overall configuration of the saw. For replacement purposes, simply count the drive links on the old chain. Life time of a chain The teeth of a chain come with a certain length. Wear and sharpening cause the teeth to become shorter. End-of- life is reached when the top of the head is too short. Interval between sharpenings A saw chain must be sharpened when the saw starts to vibrate or poorly cuts. The operator can easily feel the vibrations in the handles and the engine runs harder while cutting. Identification of the chain The length, gauge and number of drive links is punched on the side of the saw bar. This information can be found near the saw head. Since the saw bar should be turned 180 degrees between sharpenings, the punched information can be towards the saw power head or outside. Identification of a suitable chain Consult the saw's manual to determine which chain/bar combinations are compatible with the saw. A given saw will usually accept a number of different bars and chains.  Specialised chains  Chain mortiser A number of very specialised chain types have emerged over recent years. These include chains made of steel alloys optimised for cutting in extremely cold conditions, chains with tungsten carbide teeth for very dirty conditions and rescue work, ripping chains with altered blade geometry for making ripping cuts, and milling chains for chainsaw mills. Chain mortisers, used to cut the mortice of large mortice and tenon timber framing, use a number of chains, riveted side-by-side. They are used with a vertical tip-first plunge. Owing to the difficulty of resharpening the multiple teeth, these are usually made of long-lasting tungsten carbide.  Joining chain  Chains are usually bought ready-joined to length, to suit a particular bar. All chainsaws have adjustable bar mounts to allow their chain tightness to be adjusted, allowing for any wear in the chain linkages. There is no requirement to remove links to shorten worn chains, chains will wear out on their cutting teeth before wear in their pivots becomes a problem. The adjustment also permits enough slack to allow a chain to be installed, so there is no need for a \\"split link\\" when fitting, as for bicycles. Large scale operators and retail shops may buy bulk chain on reels. This must then be cut and joined to length which is done by inserting rivet pins. These non-reusable pins are usually supplied already installed into a half-link and must be peened over against a half-link on the other side. As this peening is done with a bench-mounted rotary tool, rather than hammering, it is referred to as \\"rivet spinning\\". The tool is usually hand-cranked, or may be electrically powered for mass production.

He is best remembered as the first candidate of the Socialist Labor Party of America for Vice President of the United States in the election of 1892 and as the party's candidate for president in the election of 1896. BiographyEarly years= Machett was born May 15, 1843, hailing originally from the Brighton- Allston area of Massachusetts. He was the descendant of New Englanders dating their presence in America to the 1630s. At the age of 16, Matchett went to sea and circumnavigated Cape Horn aboard a windjammer. He worked at various times in his earlier years as a United States Navy sailor, a clerk, carpenter, and beer bottler. In the middle 1880s, Matchett moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he worked as an electrician.Morris Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States. New York: Funk and Wagnalls Co., 1903; pg. 283. =Political career= Matchett served as a charter member of the Brooklyn Nationalist Club and was active in the campaign to elect Henry George as Mayor of New York. In 1890, Matchett was the organizer of American Branch No. 1 of Section New York of the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP). Matchett was influential in bringing many of the New York Nationalists into the ranks of the party.George Harmon Knoles, The Presidential Campaign and Election of 1892. Palo Alto, California: Stanford University Press, 1942; pg. 119. In 1892, Machett ran on a ticket headed by Massachusetts camera manufacturer Simon Wing as the Vice Presidential nominee of the SLP. It was the first time that the party ran a national ticket. Wing and Machett appeared on the ballot in six states and received a total of 21,512 votes. Of this total, New York City alone provided 6,100 votes.John R. Commons et al., History of Labour in the United States, New York: Macmillan, 1921; pg. 518. The platform of the party in 1892 committed to abolishing the offices of President and Vice President as soon as they came to power. According to one historian of the election, most of the SLP ticket's support in 1892 came not from labor, but from the \\"Bellamyites\\", middle-class intellectuals and reformers.George Harmon Knoles, \\"Populism and Socialism, with Special Reference to the Election of 1892,\\" Pacific Historical Review, vol. 12, no. 3 (September 1943), pp. 301‚Äì302. In the New York election of 1894, Matchett ran for Governor on the Socialist Labor Party ticket. Charles H. Matchett and Matthew Maguire, The People, July 19, 1896 In 1896, Matchett headed the Socialist Labor Party ticket as its candidate for President of the United States. About one half of the 36,359 votes received by Matchett and his running mate Matthew Maguire of New Jersey, came from New York state.William A. Dunning, \\"Record of Political Events\\", Political Science Quarterly, vol. 12, no. 2 (June 1897), pg. 362. When Matchett ran in 1896 he was the foreman for the telephone company in New York making $18 per week.\\"Another Candidate for President\\", The Daily Herald [Brownsville, Texas], July 17, 1896, pg. 2. The SLP's platform in 1896 called for government assumption of all means of production and distribution.\\"Bolting From Bryan\\", San Francisco Call, September 6, 1896, pg. 10. Matchett left the Socialist Labor Party during the organization's bitter 1899 split and joined the organization headed by Henry Slobodin and Morris Hillquit which merged with the Chicago-based Social Democratic Party of America in the summer of 1901 to form the Socialist Party of America (SPA). In 1903, Matchett ran for the New York Court of Appeals on the ticket of the SPA, receiving 33,339 votes. He was also a candidate for New York State Assembly and New York City Council at various times. Matchett was a pioneer in the United States of the international language Esperanto and a delegate to the first Universal Congress of Esperantists in 1905. There he was elected as an officer of the congress, representing the United States. The same year, the Boston Esperanto Club was founded in Matchett's home town, the first in the US.\\"C. H. Matchett, Socialist Candidate in 1896, Dead,\\" New York Tribune, October 26, 1919. =Death and legacy= Charles Matchett died October 24, 1919, in Allston, Massachusetts, after a long illness.

He was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. Early life Born in Manesi, Kalavryta, Greece, he migrated to Queensland at the age of ten with his brother. His knowledge of English was poor and he knew less than 100 words. He received his secondary education at The Southport School and was awarded the school's chemistry prize. He attended the University of Queensland and graduated with a Bachelor of Science (1963) and a Bachelor of Economics {1972}. Fouras was a research chemist and then a marketing economist with the Department of Primary Industries. Politics In 1977, Fouras was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as the Labor member for South Brisbane. He held the seat until 1986, when he was defeated for preselection by Anne Warner. He returned to the Assembly in 1989, winning the seat of Ashgrove, which he held until his retirement in 2006. Fouras was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from 1990 to 1996. Fouras' tenure as Speaker would have ended earlier in 1995 when he was not renominated by the Labor caucus as its candidate for Speaker, choosing instead Henry Palaszczuk. The party had just been re-elected to government at the 1995 Queensland state election with a one-seat majority. The dumping of Fouras as Speaker by his ALP colleagues raised the prospect of him being re-elected with the support of the Coalition, as he would have had the numbers to beat Palaszczuk on the floor of Parliament. Fearing that outcome, the ALP withdrew Palaszczuk's candidacy for Speaker and Fouras was re-elected with the support of his ALP colleagues. Upon his re-election as Speaker, the Coalition claimed that even if the ALP had not reversed its decision on Fouras, he would have been re-elected over Palaszczuk, not just with the support of the Coalition but also some ALP MPs. The claim that some ALP members would have broken the party line to support Fouras has been disputed by the ALP. During this renewed tenure as Speaker, Independent Liz Cunningham mostly sided with the Coalition in parliamentary votes. With the government having a one-seat majority, on those occasions Fouras as Speaker had to use his casting vote in order for the government to win the division. Fouras' casting vote had not been required previously because before the 1995 election the Government had had a 19-seat majority. In February 1996, the ALP lost its one-seat majority after the loss of the Mundingburra by-election and the Goss Government resigned its commission. Fouras likewise resigned as Speaker.

Three units were made, but no orders arose, at least in part due to the Reunification of Germany making similarly specified DR Class 132s available in large numbers. History and background DB 240 003-4 at Nieb√ºll station in 1990 In the late 1980s, at its own expense, MaK built three new prototypes designated as the DE 1024. They were designed as a universal high powered locomotive, capable of hauling both freight and passenger trains, for use on the non-electrified parts of the German rail network - which at that time included much of northern Germany. In October 1989 the machines were ready for use, and extensive testing took place, with the units being passed to DB for assessment. No orders from the Deutsche Bundesbahn came as a result of this - instead electrification of parts of the northern German rail network took place, the reunification of Germany put a nail in the coffin of the possibility of any orders from the home country; as large numbers of similar DR Class 132 locomotives became available. In keeping with their northern German birth and operations the locomotives were named \\"Kiel\\", \\"Westerland\\" and \\"L√ºbeck\\" respectively. Design Assembled at Kiel by MaK (and at the time the largest single engined diesel in Germany), the locomotives used an electrical power transmission system supplied by ABB with microprocessor control and GTO power electronics. In common with other MaK locomotives of that time (e.g. MaK G1206) the internal design was based around the idea of modular construction, with individual parts (engine, traction electronics etc.) being easily replaceable, and interchangeable with alternative units. The engine was a twelve-cylinder MaK 12M282,This engine is of similar design to that used in the DB Class 291 shunters with a power of at which drove an alternator (type WB630K8) producing 3 phase AC at a maximum voltage of . This electrical supply is then rectified to provide DC power to switching electronics controlled by a microprocessor, which in turn provide the electrical power supply for three phase asynchronous traction motors (of type 6FRA3368).BR 240 DB MaK-Diesellok, MaK DE 1024 bahntantchen.de Additional electrical supply of up to 700 kW could be provided for electrical train heating etc. Operations After testing and the trial runs with DB the locomotives returned to MaK. The three units were leased via Traffic Krupp GmbH whilst MaK was under Krupp ownership, being on hire to DBAG in the early 1990s. In 1994 MaK changed hands - becoming part of Siemens as Siemens Schienenfahrzeugtechnik, the locomotives were withdrawn from DB service in 1996, and were subsequently leased to H√§fen und G√ºterverkehr K√∂ln (HGK) and given the numbers EN 11, 12 and 13. The first unit suffered a fire in one of the bogies in 2008, writing the locomotive off.Vehicle profile MaK 30002 loks- aus-kiel.de The second unit was damaged by an unexplained cab fire in 2005. It was however repaired between July 2009 and September 2010 by Voith Turbo, which rebuilt the locomotive as a dual power source electro-diesel locomotive. This locomotive will serve as a proof of concept for the CREAM-project, funded by the European Commission.Vehicle profile MaK 30003 loks-aus-kiel.deCream - Work Package 5 Interoperability and border crossing The concept locomotive was baptised Voith Futura. Conclusions The concept and design of these locomotives served as the basis for the NSB Di6 class, which have received negative headlines due to their rejection and return from the Norwegian railways. The locomotives can be considered forerunners of the modern diesel electric locomotives of the 2000s such as the Eurorunner, both for the inclusion of an electronically controlled power system, and the modular design plan. Since only one locomotive remains in service, with no further machines expectedVossloh manufactures diesel electric locomotives in the former Macosa/Alstom plant in Valencia, Spain - specifically the Euro 4000, with no diesel electric locomotives being in production in Kiel in the 2000s the final example has an element of cult status amongst some diesel-electric train fans.

The development of software, a digital ‚Äúsoft‚Äù good, involves different business models, product strategy, people management, and development plan compared to the traditional manufacturing and service industries. For example in the software business, making one or ten million copies of a product cost about the same. Furthermore, the productivity difference between a good and bad employee is ten to twentyfold. As well, software projects tolerate 80 percent lateness and ongoing design changes on a regular basis.Cusumano, Michael A. The Business of Software. New York: Free Press, 2004 Software entrepreneurship involves a broad range of businesses; from helping people plan daily events to controlling a space shuttle. There are mainly three kinds of software businesses: products, services and content business such as wikipedia.  Products Versus Services  The first thing software entrepreneurs should understand is the difference and the interrelationship between products and services business. The software product business is about selling licensed packages to customers. These products help solve a user pain and have potential for growth and profits. One advantage of starting up in this direction is the ability to attract stock market investors and venture capitalists for funding. This business also enjoys enormous economies of scale in selling multiple copies of the same software. The downside of creating products is that software sales are subject to fluctuations. Sales will drop drastically in economic recessions. The service business involves creating applications for clients that tailor to their business needs. This includes the maintenance of software products they have purchased before. One advantage of service business is that long-term customer contracts can allow the company to survive rough economic times. The downside is that the business needs to attract enough clients to keep developers and consultants busy. Software companies can also develop a hybrid solution involving a mixture of products and services. In this case, solutions are sold to clients that require extensive customization. Approximately 20 to 50 percent of coding is required for each individual client. Customers purchasing this type of IT solution usually do not switch vendors for long periods of time.Cusumano, Michael A. The Business of Software. New York: Free Press, 2004  Funding  Bank Financing  This is practically an impossible method as the bank requires security and personal loan guarantees. = Government Aid = Governments usually give out non-repayable grants to encourage start-ups. There are also investment tax credits that can be claimed. One thing to be careful about government aid is the lengthy procedures that may be required before obtaining the funds. = Venture Capital = Venture capital is risk capital invested into a start-up company at its early stages. Venture capitalists usually invest in start-ups that already have a relatively developed software product and some early sales. They look for products that have a large potential in a growing market with a competitive edge.Kawasaki, Guy. The Art of the Start. England: Penguin Books Ltd, 2004 Venture capital help offers a large sum of money and often assistance in managing the company. People with software start-up experiences are available for mentoring. There are also help available in assisting the process of going public.

The word karnamruta means nectar to the ears. Lelasuka compares that to a bouquet of glory of Krishna.  Origin  The author of Sri Krishna Karnamrutam is Vilvamangalam Swamiyar.Sri. Varadachari Sadagopan's article at Sadagopan.org He was a contemporary of Swami Desikan (AD 1268-1369). Since he described with great joy the leelas of Krishna like Shukadev Goswami, the author of Bhagavata Purana, he came to be known as Leela Shuka. Leelasuka belonged to a saivite family by tradition. But he became a devotee of Krishna. Hence he refers to his traditional background by saying that he wears the feet of Lord Siva on his head. He belongs to the tradition of great devotees of Krishna of Kerala such as Narayana Bhattadhiri, the author of Sri NarayaNeeyam, Poonthaanam and Vasudeva Namboodiri and other great scholars of Dasama skhandham of Bhagavata Purana.  Controversy  Some say that he belonged to a place called Mukkutalai, originally mukti-sthalam, in kerala, which Telugu pundits refute by saying that Leelashuka has covered a vast area of south India when Andhra, Karnataka and Maharashtra states were one province. For Indian (Bharatiya), controversy word is used. For non Indians, speculation word is used.Giirvaani - Translation of Sanskrit classics As per a folklore in Dakshina Kannada (Karnataka) / Kasaragod (Kerala) region, Bilwamangala Swami (Leelashuka) was from Ananthapura, the famous Lake temple.  Legend  In his early life, he had an illicit love affair with Cintamani, a dancing girl who was a musician and harlot.Sri Krishna karnamritam English translation by Nishkinchana Maharaj. Published 1970 by Sree Gaudiya Math in Madras She teased him once about his scholarship in Vyaakaranam, Naatakam and Alankaara Saastram and told him that if he had one thousandth of the affection for Bhagavaan, he would easily save his life. That was the turning point for Bilva Mangala. He thanked Lord Krishna for showing the true destiny of his life and immersed himself in devotional service to Lord Krishna. He started his masterpiece called Krishna Karaamrutham with the slokam: \\" CHINTAAMANIR JAYATHI SOMAGIRIR GURURME \\" which means my guru Somagiri who is like cintAmaNi, the wish-giving stone is victorious. There are 328 slokas in this masterwork. He concludes with the last slokam with the passage: \\" LEELAASUKENA RACHITAM TAVA DEVA KRISHNA KARNAAMRUTHAM VAHATHU KALPA SATAANTAREPHI \\" which means may this work composed by Leelasuka create a flow of nectar for the span of time beyond one hundred kalpa ! There is a tradition to worship Krishna as Gopala Sundari. The mantra for worship in that manner has 33 beejaaksharams and is made up of Sri Rajagopaala Mantra's 18 letters and the 15 letters of Sri Pancha Dasakshari of Sri Vidya. In fact, the Lord of Raja Mannargudi (Dakshina Dwaraka), Sri Rajagopalan is meditated upon as Sri Vidya Rajagopalan. Sri Leela Sukhar worshipped this Madana Gopala Sundari form (Dhyana Slokam 3-104 of Krishna Karnaamrutham). According to some legends, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu discovered this work in Andhra on the last day of his visit to Andhra and assigned copying work to a dozen copyists, instructing them to copy it overnight. They could copy only first chapter in that night; later, on his returning to Vanga province, he found it to be incomplete, and then Mahaprabhu sent disciples to Andhra to fetch a complete copy of this work.

He was elected as the member for Archerfield in 1984, and held that seat until his election as the member for Inala in 1992. Palaszczuk retired from politics in 2006, and was succeeded in his seat of Inala by his daughter Annastacia Palaszczuk, who has been the Premier of Queensland since 2015. Early life and career Palaszczuk was born in Germany to Polish parents. His family moved to Queensland when he was young. Prior to entering politics, he earned a Diploma of Education and became a school teacher. From 1980 to 1987, he was a secretary of the Inala Branch of the Labor Party, and served as the president of various electorate committees for state and federal government. Between 1985 and 1993, he worked as the campaign director on elections for the City of Brisbane and the federal electoral division of Rankin. Member of parliament As a member of parliament, Palaszczuk served on numerous committees, including the Estimates Committee and Standing Orders Committee. When the Goss Labor Government was re-elected in 1995, the Labor caucus nominated Palaszczuk for speaker, to replace the sitting Labor speaker Jim Fouras. Labor later voted for Fouras in parliament, however, due to fears that Fouras would be re-elected as speaker with the support of the Nationals and Liberals. Wanting to avoid the controversy of Fouras crossing the floor to elect himself as speaker, Labor decided to support him instead of Palaszczuk. When the Beattie Labor Government was elected in 1998, Palaszczuk was appointed Minister for Primary Industries. In 1999, he was also appointed Minister for Rural Communities. Following the 2004 election, he was appointed Minister for Primary Industries and Fisheries. When Terry Mackenroth resigned as Treasurer and Deputy Premier in 2005, he was appointed Minister for Natural Resources and Mines, and in 2006 he had Water added to his portfolio.

Or, a lion Gules armed and langued Azure. John Charlton (also Charleton, Cherleton or Charlestone), 1st Baron Charlton of Powys (1268‚Äì1353) came from a family of minor landowners near Wellington, Shropshire. He was the son of Robert Charlton (and elder brother to Alan, and Thomas, Bishop of Hereford) of Apley castle near Wrockwardine.G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, editors, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed., 13 volumes in 14 (1910-1959; reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000), volume III, page 160. He had entered the service of the crown as a page, and when Prince Edward became king, Charlton remained in the royal household. He was recorded as a king's yeoman on 18 September 1307 and was styled as a knight shortly afterwards. In January 1308 he accompanied the king to France for his wedding, and in 1309 served in Ireland. He held the post of Chamberlain in the Royal Household before 1314, although the importance of the post is unclear. On 26 July 1309 he married Hawys Gadarn (the Hardy), heiress of the Lordship of Powys from her father the last Prince of Powys Owen de la Pole. Charlton acquired Pole castle (today's Welshpool) on his marriage, and from 1310 to 1315 he built the basis of the present Powis Castle. Strengthening the English authority over his Welsh lands, in 1310 he and Hawise's uncle Griffin de la Pole raised 400 footsoldiers from the lordship of Powis to fight against the Scots. King Edward summoned him to Parliament as the 1st Lord Charlton on 26 July 1313, a title partly acquired through the inherited right of his wife Hawise to Powys, which explains the common informal addition to his title of \\"Lord of Powis\\", \\"dominus de Powis\\" or \\"seigneur de Powis\\". John Charlton's authority in Powys grew too much for Hawise's uncle Griffin, who was aided in his opposition by the Le Strange lords of Knockin, Shropshire. By 1314, John was governor of Builth castle, with a constabulary role over the Welsh which included opposing Welsh rebels in 1316. In 1317 he raised another 300 foot soldiers for the king, and in 1319 raised a further 500 soldiers for service against the Scots. John had taken action against Hawise's uncle Griffin by 1320, finally recovering all of his wife's estates, as well as having the lands of her four uncles settled on her, in default of their male issue. Following the confiscation of the Gower Lordship from the de Braose family in breach of Marcher autonomy by King Edward and its gift to his favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger, in 1321 John Charlton joined in the baronial rebellion of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster against the Despenser family and the King. On 11 September 1322 he was very quickly pardoned for his part in the rebellion having returned to the King's side, raising another 500 men for him in 1325. John Charlton's authority on the Welsh border was threatened by The Earl of Arundel who became Justice of Wales in 1322, and Warden of the Welsh Marches in 1325, establishing his base as Constable of Montgomery Castle. In the autumn of 1326, Charlton's former ally Roger Mortimer (whose daughter Maud was married to Charlton's son John), and Queen Isabella took action against the Despenser family and other unpopular advisers to King Edward. Arundel remained loyal to the king, which gave Charlton the opportunity to rid himself of his rival by arresting and executing him (at Shrewsbury Stubbs, Chron. Ed. I and II, ii. 87 or, possibly, Hereford) under the orders of the Queen. Thomas Charlton, Bishop of Hereford who was Lord Privy Seal from 1316-1320 was John's brother. On 29 June 1337, after King Edward III had taken power from Queen Isabella, John Charlton was appointed Chief Justiciar of Ireland and his brother Thomas became Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Within a year John had returned to England, following a dispute. John Charlton split his last years between his properties at Apley Castle in Shropshire, Charlton Hall in Shrewsbury (the site now occupied by the theatre) and Powis Castle in Mid- Wales. In his later life he was a patron of Strata Marcella abbey, and was buried at the Franciscan Greyfriars Abbey in Shrewsbury, next to his wife, her father and grandfather. A fourteenth-century stained glass Jesse window, now in St Mary's church, Shrewsbury, but originally in the Greyfriars, shows at the bottom right hand corner, a knight bearing the arms of Powys who is probably Charlton. He was succeeded by his son John Charleton, 2nd Baron Cherleton. A daughter, Isbella, married John Sutton II. Their descendant Edmund Sutton would marry Joyce Tiptoft, daughter of Joyce de Cherleton, co- heiress of Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton, last to hold the title Baron Cherleton.

Everything in our body and soul is created by God, and as such, absolutely sacred. It is up to my own freedom to get angry, fall in love, play, create, eat, rejoice, be sorrowful, in such a manner that will bring me continuously closer to the Divine Source of my being: this is the meaning of the Incarnation. God does not call me to escape from this world, but to transform it into a place of His manifestation\\" \\"Anselm says: why did the Incarnation happen? So that the Son of God could be punished in the place of man. Gregory the Theologian says: the Incarnation happened, 'because humanity must be sanctified by the Humanity of God'. Quite the opposite, in other words. And the Theologian continues: the only thing God wants, is to stop decay. Now try and build legalism on a position such as that of the Greek Fathers! It is impossible. That's why many of my fellow students in France marvelled at us Greeks, saying: ¬´vous √™tes anarchistes¬ª (you are anarchists)!\\" Bibliography Fr.

Frances wrote a series of thrillers by, and often featuring, Hank Janson, beginning with When Dames Get Tough (1946). Many of the later \\"Hank Janson\\" novels were the work of other authors. The \\"Hank Janson\\" books Hank Janson was the most popular and successful of British pulp fiction authors of the 1940s and 1950s. His books were violent \\"pseudo-American\\" thrillers sold in paperback editions featuring erotic cover art, and it is estimated that some five million copies were sold by 1954. Recalling his childhood enthusiasm for Janson, British playwright Simon Gray recalled how \\"the titles alone drove my blood wild‚ÄîTorment for Trixy‚ÄîHotsy, You'll be Chilled‚Äîand on the cover a vivid blonde, blouse ripped, skirt hitched up to her thighs, struggling sweetly against chains, ropes and a gag‚Äîand in the top right hand corner, set in a small circle, like a medallion, the silhouette presumably of Hank himself, trench coat open, trilby tilted back, a cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth.\\"Simon Gray, The Smoking Diaries (Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2005, p13) In the 1950s, the authorities attempted a crack-down on allegedly obscene pulp literature, targeting the Janson books among others. Several of the Hank Janson novels were banned in the Republic of Ireland. \\"78 Books banned by the Censorship Board\\", The Irish Times, 23 March 1953. In 1954 author, D. F.

When offered by the famed British outfitter W.J. Jeffery & Co, it was renamed the .500 Jeffery so as to be more palatable to British hunters and sportsmen following World War One. History The .500 Jeffery was introduced to bring firepower comparable to the .505 Gibbs into a standard sized 1898 Mauser action as used with the 8x57mm and 7x57mm cartridges. The Gibbs and .416 Rigby cartridges required oversized magnum Mauser actions. To shoehorn a large round into the 98 action required a rebated rim. When introduced, the .500 Jeffery was technically rated as the most powerful rifle cartridge although in reality not quite up to .505 Gibbs performance. The .505 Gibbs with greater capacity can be loaded far in excess of the .500 Jeffery today. Not that it matters for hunting either were plenty for the largest game in the world when introduced. Ammunition availability Like the .505 Gibbs, the .500 Jeffery is enjoying somewhat of a renaissance among American shooters and African Big Game hunters in the early 21st century, almost 100 years after their introduction.African Conservation Foundation As of 2009, Norma, Kynoch, Mauser, Corbon, and Westley Richards are offering loaded ammunition in .500 Jeffery. There may be other manufacturers as well. Ammunition can cost anywhere from $150 for a box of 20 or more depending on the manufacturer. Rifles There have been a few rifles chambered in the .500 Jeffery including Jeffery, Heym, CZ-USA, and a few single shots including Ruger No. 1, and the Butch Searcy & Co. Mauser offers its Model 98 magnum in the caliber. Its \\"Elephant\\" model is offered in 500 Jeffery exclusively. In 2011, Sako began offering the caliber in its Model 85 \\"Safari\\" rifle using a new XL size action, and since 2014 the XL action has been available in the more affordable Model 85 Brown Bear rifle. Blaser also offers rifles chambered in the caliber. Many of the modern rifles have feeding issues due to the rebated rim. The original Jeffery used a single column 2 shot magazine to get around the potential reliability resulting from a rebated rim. Criticism The 500 Jeffery has had a few issues since its introduction. It has a rather short neck length that can make it difficult to seat bullets with a relatively high sectional density. Also it has a small shoulder. This is not usually an issue but as the 500 Jeffery also has a rebated rim it makes it rather difficult to extract in extreme conditions. Ballistics When the 500 Jeffery was first introduced it was loaded to a velocity of topped off with a 535 grain bullet generating of muzzle energy, which makes it a pretty good hunting caliber generally where thick skinned dangerous game occurs. Since then reloading capabilities have advanced being able to launch heavier bullets at higher velocities. Now with modern reloads the 500 Jeffery can launch a 600 grain bullet at a muzzle velocity ranging at about . max. generating to With newer reloads it made the 500 Jeffery the most powerful production cartridge in the world until the introduction of the .460 Weatherby Magnum. With reloads the 460 Weatherby can reach levels of power of about of muzzle energy. Also the .600 Nitro Express exceeds the 500 Jeffery in muzzle energy with 120 grains of cordite. No doubt the 500 Jeffery is still a respected caliber all across the world. The big fifty African calibers are probably close to the limit of what the advanced shooter can handle. There was the fully adequate 416, 404 and 450 class rounds. Then the fifties, 500NE, 505 Gibbs and 500 Jeff. After that were the big stoppers 577 NE, 600NE and the bore rifles 8,6,4 gauge. The 500 Jeffrey claim to fame was the ability to fit into a standard 98 action with a single stack feed for a 2-round capacity.

The U.S. agreed to deliver to the Indians annually a quantity of salt not exceeding . Article 4 cedes to the United States the right of locating three tracts of land (of such size as may he agreed to by the Kickapoo, Eel River band of Miami, Wea, Piankeshaw, and Kaskaskia tribes), for the purposes of erecting houses of entertainment for the accommodation of travellers on the main road between Vincennes and Kaskaskia and one other on the road between Vincennes and Clarksville. Article 5 allowed for alterations to the boundary lines described in the first article if it is found that settlements of land made by citizens of the United States fall in the Indian country. It was agreed that a quantity of land equal in quantity to what may be thus taken shall be given to the said tribes either at the east or the west end of the tract.

Ms. Murphy began writing when she was five because as she puts it, ‚ÄúI wrote because of the joy of holding in my hand something that I had made, something that could never disappear again the way all my thoughts did‚Äù. Louise Murphy also loved reading and still today tells her students to read anything possible.  Education  Murphy attended the University of Kentucky in 1964. Upon leaving the University, she became a junior high English teacher in Newark, DE from 1966-68. After teaching at a junior high, she went to San Francisco State University in 1977 where she received her master's degree of art and became a professor at the university from 1977-82.  Writing career  She began writing novels in 1980 when she wrote her first book (a children‚Äôs book), My Garden: A Journal for Gardening around the Year, a journal that has weekly entries about gardening from January to the beginning of November. After writing her first book, she continued writing and also continued her teaching. Her next novel was The Sea Within, a story of a woman who is depressed because of her destroyed marriage and inability to have a child, so she decides to start a new life in Kentucky. After writing The Sea Within, she went on to become a teacher of novel writing at the Acalanes Adult Education in Lafayette, California from 1986-91. She wrote many essays and poetry pieces in newspapers, magazines, and journals. She then wrote a poem and a book in the same year: 2003. She wrote Pilgrimage (a poem) and then probably her most significant and acclaimed novel: The True Story of Hansel and Gretel: A Novel of War and Survival. She caught both kids and adult readers in her story of the classic fairy tale Hansel and Gretel mixed in with the Holocaust and World War II. Mark Harris, a reporter for Entertainment Weekly, described the change from the fairy tale into a ‚Äúparable of survival‚Äù an ‚Äúintriguing idea‚Äù. She won the Writers Digest award for poetry and she also won the Shaunt Basmajian Award for books both in 2003.

It was a single-engined biplane intended to replace the Sopwith Camel, but only one was built, being destroyed in a crash. The Sopwith Snipe was built instead to replace the Camel. Development and design In 1917, as a result of an official Inquiry (the Burbidge Report) into the activities of the Royal Aircraft Factory, design and construction of aircraft at Farnborough ceased, and the Factory's design teams were broken up.Bruce 1965, p.168. This allowed the Nieuport & General Aircraft Co Ltd, which was formed at Cricklewood, London in 1916 to license produce French Nieuport aircraft,Flight 16 November 1916, p.1016. to acquire the services of Henry Folland, previously responsible for the design of the S.E.5 fighter, as chief designer.Bruce 1965, p.168. His first design for Nieuport & General was another fighter, intended to meet Air Board Specification A.1.A for a replacement for the Sopwith Camel, in competition with designs submitted by Sopwith (the Sopwith Snipe), Austin Motors (the Austin Osprey) and Boulton & Paul (the Bobolink).Mason 1992, pp.130-131. This aircraft, designated Nieuport B.N.1 (for \\"British Nieuport\\"), was a single-engined, single seat tractor biplane of wooden construction. It had equal-span, unstaggered two bay wings, a slab-sided fuselage and was powered by a 230 hp (172 kW) Bentley BR2 rotary engine. A distinctive feature was a ventral fin, as used on the S.E.5 (which was to become a distinguishing mark of many of Folland's designs). Armament was the normal pair of synchronised Vickers machine guns together with a Lewis gun mounted on the upper wing, firing over the propeller.Bruce 1957, p.317. Three B.N.1s were ordered, the first one flying in February 1918. When it was evaluated, it demonstrated performance that was generally superior to the Snipe, with a much better ceiling. It was destroyed, however, on 10 March 1918 when its engine (only the sixth BR2 built) caught fire in the air. This caused the B.N.1 to be abandoned, with the Snipe being purchased to replace the Camel, and Folland concentrating on the design of the more advanced Nieuport Nighthawk.

The Seven Hills of Rome. RomeGeorgia.com. 23 February 2002. Retrieved 17 March 2018.Denmon, Shirley. The Enchanted Land Eighth Hill. (2012). pp. 5.  History  The clock tower was built in 1871 under the direction of James Noble, Jr. and his family. It was originally built to hold the 250,000 gallons of water that would serve the city. Sheets of iron 10 feet long were used to build the frame of the tank, and red bricks surround it. The tank itself stood 63 feet tall and 26 feet wide. Atop the water tank, there is a bell and four clock faces located within a structure that stands 41 feet tall. Both the clock and bell were added in 1872, just one year after the original tower was built. The clocks were made by E. Howard Clock Company. Each face is nine feet in diameter, the hour hand is three feet, six inches long, and the minute hand is four feet, three inches long. The bell within the clock tower is made of genuine bronze and measures 40 inches wide. Engraved on the rim is the date 1872. With the addition of the clocks and bell the clock tower now stands 104 feet tall and can be seen from almost any part of downtown Rome. By the 1890s the tower could no longer support the city's water needs, and ceased to operate as a water tower. After the closing of the tower, it began to fall into a state of mild disrepair, it stayed in that state throughout the 20th Century.  Recently  The Rome Jaycees raised over $80,000, in 1986. The money was raised in order to provide landscaping on top of Neely Hill around the clock tower. The historical clock tower is now a museum, which opened in 1995, once again with the help of the Rome Jaycees. The inside of the water tank now displays works of art by local artist Chuck Smultz. Also inside are the 107 steps spiraling around the tower to the top.

The agent would attempt to perceive the light in one room while the receiver would use a switch to identify which lamp had been lit in the other room.

In 2019, eight EDOs agreed to merge and form a single national organisation Environmental Defender Office (EDO Ltd). Background The Environmental Defender's Office (NSW) was a community legal centre specialising in public interest environmental law. The EDO provides legal advice and representation in public interest environmental law matters. In addition to the provision of legal services, the Office takes an active role in law reform and the formulation of policy, provides technical and scientific advice to help the community understand environmental documents and carries out community programs on environmental law. The Environmental Defender's Office has an active international program, and contributes in a wide range of environmental advocacy activities, with particular focus on the Asia-Pacific region. The Environmental Defender's Office (NSW) has identified 'priority areas' that include climate change, environmental planning and development, biodiversity conservation, natural resource management, environmental justice as well as corporate social responsibility. Key cases The EDO has brought proceedings in a variety of cases involving disputes of public interest environmental law. The following are recent key cases EDO NSW has run: *Mackay Conservation Group v Commonwealth of Australia and Adani Mining (2016) :The EDO acted on behalf of the Mackay Conservation Group, and successfully challenged the Federal Environment Ministers approval of the Carmichael coal mine on the Great Barrier Reef. The case alleged the Australian Environment Minister, Greg Hunt, failed to take into account a number of factors, required by law, when approving the Carmichael Mine. The case was successful on the ground that the Minister failed to take into account, as required by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, Requirements for decisions about threatened species and endangered communities. his Department‚Äôs approved conservation advice for two threatened species, the Yakka Skink and the Ornamental Snake. *Humane Society International Inc (HSI) v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd (Kyodo) (2008) :EDO acted for Humane Society International and sought a declaration that Kyodo breached the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 by whaling in the Australian Whale Sanctuary adjacent to Antarctica and an injunction to prevent the killing of whales in this area. His Honour Justice Allsop made a declaration that Kyodo was in breach of Australian law and granted HSI an injunction to restrain Kyodo from further breaches of the EPBC Act.. In 2015 Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd was found guilty of wilful contempt of court and fined A$1,000,000.. *Minister for Planning v Walker (2008) :Acting on behalf of Jill Walker, a local resident of Sandon Point, the EDO challenged a Part 3A development approval. This case has important implications for how the Minister for Planning must deal with major projects under Part 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. Justice Biscoe reviewed the principles of ESD as well as US and Australian case law on climate change. He found that the Minister had failed to consider ESD by failing to consider whether the impacts of the proposed development would be compounded by climate change.. *The Hub Action Group Inc v The Minister of Planning and Orange City Council (2008) :The EDO successfully represented The Hub Action Group, a group of local residents opposed to a proposal to develop ‚Äòthe Hub' regional waste facility on agricultural land near Molong. Justice Preston found that the proposal was not sustainable, partly because it was likely to adversely affect the long term use of the area and sustained agricultural production.. *Anderson and Anor v Director-General of Environment and Conservation and Ors (2006) : The EDO represented Douglas and Susan Anderson, traditional owners of land at Angels Beach, East Ballina. They challenged the validity of consent issued by Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation that allowed the destruction of Aboriginal cultural heritage for a residential subdivision. Justice Pain ruled that the consent was invalid, due to a failure to take into account certain relevant matters as well as the Director- General‚Äôs failure to adequately apply the principles of ecologically sustainable development..

Construction An incomplete Jeannette Skinner on 30 June 1917, immediately after her launching at the Skinner and Eddy Corporation shipyard at Seattle, Washington.Jeannette Skinner was laid down as the commercial cargo ship J. M. Fox at Seattle by the Skinner and Eddy Corporation. Before she was launched, the Norwegian shipping firm Knut Knutsen OAS bought her and renamed her Jeannette Skinner. She was launched on 30 June 1917. Service history1917-1918= Before she could be completed, Jeannette Skinner was commandeered for World War I service by the United States Shipping Board in August 1917. Completed in September 1917, she was placed in service for the next several months as a civilian cargo ship under Shipping Board control. =1918-1919= Jeannette Skinner was acquired by the U.S. Navy for World War I service on 12 April 1918, assigned naval registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1321, and commissioned the same day as USS Jeannette Skinner with Lieutenant Commander C. A. Nickerson, USNRF, in command. Jeannette Skinner was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service to transport cargo from the United States to France. After loading a cargo of general United States Army supplies at Baltimore, Maryland, Jeannette Skinner departed New York City on 3 May 1918 with a convoy for Brest, France, where she arrived on 17 May 1918. Returning to New York in June, she loaded another U.S. Army cargo at Baltimore and delivered it at Brest and Bordeaux, France, in August 1918. Her third eastbound voyage took her from New York to La Pallice, France, and Bordeaux in September‚ÄìOctober 1918. While in the Gironde River in France on 27 November, 16 days after the end of the war, Jeannette Skinner was damaged in collision with the Japanese steamer Ceylon Maru. During her return voyage in December, she had to put in at Bermuda for fuel and, upon arrival at Baltimore, entered drydock to begin two months of repairs. In March‚ÄìApril 1919 Jeannette Skinner carried a cargo of wheat, oats, and lard to Cette, France, via Gibraltar on behalf of the Southern Food Administration. Once again she had to refuel on her homeward voyage, this time in the Azores. She arrived at Baltimore on 2 June 1919. Jeannette Skinner was decommissioned at Baltimore on 10 June 1919 and was returned to the Shipping Board the same day. =1919-1945= Once again SS Jeannette Skinner, the ship returned to commercial service. In 1937, the Shipping Board sold her to a British firm based in Shanghai, China. She was taken over by the British Ministry of War Transport for World War II service in August 1944, then transferred to the United States War Shipping Administration in December. She was scrapped at Baltimore in August 1945. NotesReferences * *Department of the Navy: Naval Historical Center Online Library of Selected Images: Civilian Ships: S.S.

The organization is headquartered in Arlington, VA. Mission The mission of the AER is to help US Army soldiers and their dependents, by providing emergency aid, in the form of either a direct grant (a cash gift, not to be repaid) or an interest-free loan, and by giving college scholarships to children of soldiers. Under Army regulations, officers must recommend whether their soldiers deserve aid. Loans up to $1000 do not require command recommendation, and there is no limit to the amount of funds Army Emergency Relief may authorize. Officers are responsible for ensuring that their soldiers repay AER loans.  Assets, aid, and expenses  In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that the AER had, between 2003 and 2007, distributed a total of $64 million in aid, an average of $13 million per year, while adding $117 million to its reserves, and reaching total assets of $345 million. AER ended 2007 with a $296 million in its investment portfolio of stocks and bonds. During that five-year period of 2003-2007, AER's emergency assistance consisted of 91 percent repayable loans and 9 percent direct grants. In 2008, AER gave out $5.5 million in emergency grants, $65 million in loans, and $12 million in scholarships, to a total of 72,000 people. For 2009, AER plans to reduce its total scholarships to $8 million.. As of early 2009, AER was paying for a staff of 21 people, all at its headquarters at the Army Human Resources Command in Alexandria, Virginia, with the Army paying 300 or so other civilians, located at ninety Army sites worldwide, who worked full-time for the AER. The Army also provides AER its office space at no charge.  Armed Forces Relief Trust  In 2003, a new nonprofit organization, the Armed Forces Relief Trust, was formed with assistance from the National Association of Broadcasters. The mission of the trust is to assist the four military aid societies - AER, the Air Force Aid Society, the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, and the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance, by providing a single place to receive donations for the entire U.S. Armed Services.

During World War I, he was also a major contributor to the development of naval camouflage. Background He was born Loyd Ancile Jones in York, Nebraska. He was educated at the University of Nebraska, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1908 and master's degree in science in 1910. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Rochester in 1933. Career Following graduate school, Jones moved to Washington D.C., where he worked for several years as a laboratory assistant at the U.S. Bureau of Standards doing research in photometry, colorimetry, spectro-photometry, spectroscopy, and retinal sensitivity. In 1912, he joined the scientific research staff at Eastman Kodak Company, where he became chief physicist in 1916, a position he continued in until his retirement (Behrens 2009, p. 201). His research at Eastman Kodak generally related to the subject of sensitometry. Camouflage Research When the U.S. became involved in World War I, George Eastman offered to the U.S. Navy the expertise of Jones (who served in the U.S. Naval Reserves) and others for the purpose of researching naval camouflage in relation to optics and physics (Ackerman 1930, p. 310). Other people at the time argued that visual artists would be better equipped than scientists to develop camouflage. A compromise solution was reached, and on March 25, 1918, architect Harold Van Buskirk was placed in charge of a U.S. Navy camouflage unit, consisting of two major sections: A design section made up of artists, located in Washington D.C., headed by artist Everett L. Warner; and a research section made up largely of scientists, located at the Eastman laboratories in Rochester, New York, under the supervision of Jones (Van Buskirk 1919; Warner 1919). In connection with his research of naval camouflage, Jones and his staff developed in the laboratory an ‚Äúexperimental ocean,‚Äù which used an observation tank, artificial sun, movable sky, and other components that simulated outdoor viewing conditions, as miniature camouflaged ships were observed through a submarine periscope. He also developed an outdoor observation stage on the shore of Lake Ontario. Painted cut-out silhouettes of camouflaged ships were suspended from a framework, at a height that made the ships appear to be floating on the water (Jones 1919; Skerrett 1919; Scientific American 1919). Inventions Jones was a prolific inventor. He was responsible for at least eighteen registered patents, and authored dozens of articles on such subjects as photometry, physical optics, illuminating engineering, colorimetry, photography and motion pictures. One of his wartime inventions was a scope- like observation device called a visibility meter (U.S. Patent No. 1,437,809), which measured a ship‚Äôs visibility in an ocean setting (Ackerman 1930). Distinctions Jones served as President of the Optical Society of America (OSA) from 1930 to 1931, and as President of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers from 1924 to 1925. In 1943, he was awarded the Frederic Ives MedalOptical Society of America. Frederic Ives Medal / Quinn Prize.

A native of Bollington, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England, John Ryle started working in the silk mills of his native town at the age of five, where he was known as a \\"bobbin boy.\\" Ryle's entire family had been involved in the silk industry for generations, and his two eldest brothers, Reuben and William Ryle, were the country's largest manufacturers of silk. These two brothers remained in England and continued their partnership as long as they both lived, and attained excellent reputations and amassed fortunes in their business.  Early life  John Ryle was one of seventeen children born to Peter and Sarah (Brunt) Ryle. Only five of the children lived to maturity - Reuben, William, Sarah, John and Peter Jr. John Ryle was left an orphan at the age of seven years by the death of his mother, his father having died four years before that time. He worked in various silk mills in and about Macclesfield until the year 1839, when, having just obtained his majority, he concluded to gratify his strong desire to seek his fortune in America, and accordingly sailed from Liverpool on 1 March 1839, in the ship Marian bound for New York, where he arrived after a voyage of forty-nine days. Descendants of John Ryle confirmed that their ancestor sailed to the United States to scope out business for his two brothers, and to see how the silk industry was progressing in America without ever having any intentions of remaining there permanently. By the time Ryle arrived in America, silk was not manufactured to any great extent in the United States. The mutlicaulis fever was then at its height and America promised to be the silk producing country of the world. One of the most largely interested in this multicaulis speculation was Samuel Whitmarsh of Northampton, Massachusetts. This gentleman had also a small silk mill at the latter place, and thither Mr. Ryle went and obtained employment, his work here, however was short lived for in that same year the multicaulis speculation collapsed, and his employer, Mr. Whitmarsh, was ruined in the crash which followed. John Ryle then returned to New York and for a short time imported the products of the looms of his brothers in England and carried on business of importing and selling in a small way at the corner of Maiden Lane and William Streets.  The Silk Industry Starts in Paterson  During his first year in America, Mr. Ryle made the acquaintance of Mr. George W. Murray who at that time contemplated starting in the silk manufacturing business. Mr. Christopher Colt, of Hartford, Connecticut, had a small plant of silk machinery and had made an unsuccessful attempt at manufacturing in what became known as the Old Gun Mill in Paterson, and there Mr. Murray and Mr. Ryle came. In 1840, Murray bought the plant and placed it in charge of John Ryle, who in three years later was admitted to partnership, the business then being carried under the name of Murray & Ryle. In 1846, Ryle with the assistance of his two brothers who remained in Macclesfield, bought out Mr. Murray's interest and continued the business alone. The following year he bought the building in which his machinery stood, and continued to increase his facilities. In 1850, having thoroughly established his business here and being desirous of increasing his knowledge of manufacturing methods elsewhere, he went to Europe and visited the principal manufactories of France, Italy and Switzerland. A fair specimen of Ryle's establishment was the manufacture of a large flag which waved over the Crystal Palace during the exhibition known as the \\"World's Fair\\" in New York City in 1855. About that time, he bought the romantic valley and heights surrounding the Passaic Falls, and the following year expended large sums of money in enhancing their already magnificent beauty; at that time Paterson had no public park, and as Mr. Ryle throughout his whole life was a man of acts rather than words, he made his purchase a grand park and threw it open to the people of Paterson. The city of Paterson at this time had no water service, and John Ryle after furnishing its citizens with a public park, conceived the idea of providing them with a good water service also, and to this end, after procuring the necessary legislative authority, through a charter granted to the Passaic Water Company, built the reservoir now known as the lower reservoir in the Falls Park grounds and proceeded to lay the necessary mains through the principal streets of the city. The water for the reservoir which supplied these mains was taken from the Passaic River, behind the Old Gun Mill, and pumped to the reservoir by the means of an old plunger pump. Ryle was the founder of and first President of the Passaic Water Company. In 1855, Mr. Ryle formed a partnership with his nephew, William Ryle, of England. After about two years, the latter withdrew, and John Ryle continued his business alone for a number of years. About 1866, the firm of John Ryle & Co., was formed - John C. Ryle, son of his brother Reuben in England, being a partner, and a large and successful business was carried on by them in the Murray Mill until 1869.  Mayor of Paterson  As a natural result of the course of his life, John Ryle had by this time gained unbounded popularity throughout the city, and although he had heretofore never allowed his name to be used as a possible candidate for any public office, yet he succumbed to the importunities of his friends and consented in the spring of 1869 to become candidate for the Mayor of Paterson, New Jersey. He was elected by the largest majority that any candidate had received up to that time. While John Ryle served as Paterson's mayor, he designed the Coat of Arms for the city which depicted a young man planting a mulberry bush. According to popular legend, silk worms are fond of mulberry plants, and given Ryle's association with the silk industry, the image was adopted and is still used today.  The Murray Mill Fire  On 10 May 1869, the Murray Mill together with a large and costly lot of silk and a complete plant of improved machinery was burned up in a few hours. The property destroyed at this fire was estimated to have been worth $600,000.00 and there was not a dollar of insurance upon it. John Ryle's capital was so much impaired by this fire that he found it impossible to resume without financial aid. His friends came to his assistance and the Ryle Silk Company was organized and rebuilt the mill. The new Murray Mill was completed in 1870, and Ryle theorized that a one story mill lighted from the top would possess superior advantages in the way of light. This theory proved correct, and the Murray Mill was admitted to be the best lighted mill in Paterson, and, as the light is taken from the north exclusively, the operatives are not inconvenienced by the direct rays of the sun. It was told that the day after the fire as John Ryle was looking at the ruins, the late George Jackson walked up to him and said: \\"Well, John, you've got a hard blow. I guess you'll need some help\\" and putting his hand in his pocket, Jackson pulled out a huge roll of bills, and thrusting them in John Ryle's hand said, \\"That will help a little, and you can pay me back when you are able.\\" When Ryle took the money to the bank and counted it, the sum was found to be $30,000.00. In after years, when George Jackson got into trouble, Ryle left no stone unturned to get him out of the difficulty. The Ryle Silk Manufacturing Company began manufacturing operations in 1870, but in a few years John Ryle had become by purchase the sole owner of the stock. In 1877, he organized the Pioneer Silk Company, the stock of which represented his business and was held by himself and the members of his family and since then the business continued under the same name. In the spring of 1885, Ryle opened negotiations with some capitalists of Allentown, Pennsylvania, who built a mill upon favorable terms, to which the throwing department of the Pioneer Silk Company was removed. Weaving was also added to the Allentown plant. Also, in 1885, Ryle received a medal for the silk flag he wove for the Exhibition Building in New York. Ryle was also a pioneer in the efforts to secure protection to American industry and his face and form were familiar in the halls of Congress in the earlier years before that principle became as well fixed and understood as it is now. It was claimed that while others reaped golden harvests from the field in which he labored, John Ryle paved the way for their successes, and more than any other man is entitled to the credit of having been the pioneer in the silk industry in America.  John Ryle's Family  John Ryle was married in 1841 to Sarah Morfitt (1825‚Äì1867), the daughter of William and Hannah Morfitt of Lancashire, England. Nine children were born to John and Sarah Ryle, namely, Reuben Ryle (1842‚Äì1916), William Ryle (1845‚Äì1906), Sarah Ryle (1847‚Äì1851), Peter Ryle (1851‚Äì1893), Annie Ryle (1853‚Äì1857), Jemima Ryle (1858‚Äì1899), John Ryle Jr. (1860‚Äì1886), Thomas M. Ryle (1863‚Äì1922), and Charles Storrs Ryle, who died in infancy in 1866. Reuben Ryle, the eldest son, was the chief operating officer in the Ryle family silk companies. When a branch of the Pioneer Silk Company opened in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1886, Reuben Ryle went to that city to manage the company. He died in Allentown in 1916. William Ryle was more interested in banking than in silk manufacturing. He was a collector of art, and financed the career of noted landscape artist Julian Rix from California. William Ryle died of Bright's Disease in 1906, shortly after retiring as President of the Silk City Bank. Peter Ryle channeled his interests in silk manufacturing and banking also, but also went on to become a corporation attorney and set up a law practice with Eugene Stevenson in Paterson. Peter Ryle later went on to own one of Paterson's original newspapers, the Paterson Morning Call. He died of typhoid in 1893 at the age of 42. Jemima Ryle went on to marry Augustus Roberts, a successful tobacco manufacturer. She died shortly after their marriage in 1899, aged 41. John Ryle Jr. worked briefly with his family in the silk industry before being sent out to Allentown to assist his brother Reuben in running the family business. He died in Allentown six months after having arrived there, in 1886, aged 26, of typhoid fever. Thomas M. Ryle, the last surviving child of John and Sarah Ryle, worked briefly in the silk industry, managed the Pioneer Silk Company, but then turned most of his attention to banking and real estate. He purchased a tract of land in present-day Woodland Park, New Jersey where he built an estate called Ryle Park. Ryle Park later became a popular recreation area around the dawn of the 20th century. He served as a Passaic County Freeholder before ill health forced him to retire at an early age. The last of the original silk family Ryles, Thomas M. Ryle died in 1922 at the age of 59.  Death of the Pioneer Silk Manufacturer  In 1887, John Ryle returned to Macclesfield, Cheshire, England, in the company of his only surviving daughter, Jemima. After several months of revisiting the sites he had not seen since his youth, he took ill at the hotel where he was staying. After recovering from what appeared to be a common cold, on the 6th of November, 1887, John Ryle suffered a stroke while dressing for Sunday church services and died in the arms of his daughter. He was 70 years old. At the request of his family, John Ryle's body was returned to his adopted home of Paterson, where he was laid to rest in Cedar Lawn Cemetery, Paterson, New Jersey, one of the most beautiful Victorian cemeteries in the United States. A massive obelisk was later erected over his grave on the hilltop and a bronze bust fitted into the monument and positioned in the direction of the city of Paterson. John Ryle's children later took charge of his extensive real estate holdings in the city of Paterson and formed the John Ryle Real Estate Association, which acted as a holding company for the family's assets. The company was officially dissolved in the 1940s but was later reincorporated and is still owned and operated by the descendants of John Ryle. References *Charles A.

It is located close to the confluence of the Afon Cennen and the River Towy. Population is 516 according to 2017 census.https://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-wales.php?cityid=W37000344 Etymology The Welsh name for the village is Ffair-fach signifying 'little fair'. In the early 17th century it was recorded as Ffair fach yn Llandilo. The 'large fair' took place in neighbouring Llandeilo.Hywel Wyn Owen & Richard Morgan, 2007 Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales, Gomer Press Llandyssul, Ceredigion It was reportedly formerly known as Abercennen. History In the early 19th century Ffairfach was a fair sized village of about three dozen houses. It had a corn mill and a village inn, The Torbay Inn, which doubled as a blacksmiths. The Tabernacle chapel was built in 1818, with a burial ground. Two fairs were held each year, one on 5 May and a cattle fair on 22 November. The Union Poor House was built about 1839.http://www.workhouses.org.uk/LlandiloFawr/ River Towy in Ffairfach The stone used to build the nearby Llandeilo Bridge (1848) was excavated from a quarry near the signal box at the side of the railway and immediately below Rock Villa at Ffairfach, after satisfactory tests for quality. The British School was established in 1858 near the Torbay Inn. The first schoolmaster was Mr. David Morgan, who later wrote The Story of Carmarthenshire (1908). The council school was built about 1899. A gas works were erected about 1860. Railway Ffairfach railway station Ffairfach railway station lies on the Heart of Wales Line which runs between Shrewsbury and Swansea. Ffairfach boasted two railway stations within 300 yards of each other, and a third station at Llandeilo was only a mile or so away. Passengers from the Amman Valley and Carmarthen usually alighted at the Ffairfach stations, as they would save 1 ¬Ω pence on the return fare, which meant a great deal in those days. Also the distance from Llandeilo station to the church square was almost as far as it would be if they walked from Ffairfach. Three-quarters of the commerce of the town of Llandeilo at this time came from the south of the Tywi bridge; consequently Ffairfach became important, for rail and road passengers made use of the village as the first stopping place en route for Llandeilo. The first railway through Ffairfach was built by the Llanelli Dock Railway (Llanelli to Llandovery) in 1856. The second was built by the London North Western in 1865 Carmarthen to Llandeilo through the beautiful vale of the Tywi. The name of the station was Llandeilo Bridge.

A distant relative of the earls of Stafford, Humphrey Stafford became the greatest landowner in the county of Dorset through fortunes of inheritance. Later, Stafford was one of several men promoted rapidly through the nobility by King Edward IV, to fill the power vacuum left by dead or forfeit Lancastrians. In the West Country it was particularly the forfeitures of the Lancastrian Courtenay family that benefited Stafford. In 1469 he received the Courtenay title of Earl of Devon. Stafford held the comital title for only three months. In July he was sent north to quell a rebellion instigated by the discontented Earl of Warwick. Even though he escaped the disastrous Battle of Edgecote, he was lynched by a mob at Bridgwater on 17 August 1469. Considered an overambitious man by many, Stafford was nevertheless a capable administrator, who enjoyed the absolute confidence of the king. Family background The Staffords of Hooke in Dorset and Southwick in Wiltshire were a cadet branch of the earls of Stafford and later dukes of Buckingham. Humphrey's grandfather was another Humphrey Stafford, called Sir Humphrey \\"of the silver hand\\" (d. 1442). His heir was a grandsonyet another Humphrey Staffordwho died childless in 1461. This left Humphrey Stafford, the future Earl of Devon, heir to the family lands, the greatest part of which was in Dorset and the rest mostly in Somerset and Wiltshire. Humphrey's father, William Stafford (d.1450), was already dead by this time, having fallen victim to Jack Cade's Rebellion on 18 June 1450. William's uncle, and Humphrey's great uncle, was John Stafford, Archbishop of Canterbury (1443‚Äì1452). The inheritance of these family lands made Stafford the greatest landowner in the county of Dorset. Through his mother Katherine, he was also heir to the possessions of her father John Chidiock, another major south-western landowner. At some pointdefinitely after 21 June 1450he married Isabel, daughter of Sir John Barre of Herefordshire. Service to the House of York A map of the West Countrythe area of Stafford's dominance. In the late 1450s, Stafford might have been in the service of his distant relative John Stafford, Earl of Wiltshire, son of Humphrey Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. His association with James Touchet, Baron Audleyone of Wiltshire's menimplies so. If so, this represented a short episode of loyalty to the House of Lancaster over the House of York in the ongoing civil war. In 1460 the two were sent to Gu√Ænes to relieve the English garrison there. Bad weather forced them into the harbour of Calais, which was held by the Yorkist leader Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. Here they were both recruited for the Yorkist cause. Stafford took part in the Battle of Mortimer's Cross, where the Yorkist forces under Edward, Earl of March, won a major victory on 2 February 1461. After the Battle of Towton on 29 March that year, Stafford was knighted by Edward, who had by now been pronounced King Edward IV after the deposition of Henry VI. Later that same year, on 26 July, he received a summons to Parliament for the first time, as Lord Stafford of Southwick. Over the course of the following years, the king granted him numerous lands and offices. In 1461 he was appointed steward of the Duchy of Cornwall and constable of Bristol, and in 1462 he received the greater part of the Devon estates of Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, who had been captured at Towton and executed. In 1464 he was made keeper of Dartmoor, and in 1467 he was granted more of the Courtenay manors. Stafford repaid the king's generosity by serving him faithfully as a local commissioner, in a part of the country that had up until that point been fiercely Lancastrian. Throughout the 1460s he presided at Quarter Sessions and other courts all over the West Country. His activities were not limited to legal commissions; in 1461‚Äì2 he performed military service against the Scots, and in 1468 he conducted diplomacy with Brittany. In 1469 he was admitted to the Royal Council, and served on the commission that convicted Henry Courtenay, Thomas Courtenay's brother, for treason. According to the chronicler John Warkworth, Henry's downfall was due to the machinations of Stafford, who was rewarded with further land and the earldom of Devon on 17 May 1469. However, the king himself took great interest in the trial against Courtenay, and it is more reasonable to see the decision as a result of Edward's need for a loyal agent in the region.Ross (1997), p. 123. Death and aftermath Stafford's quick rise did not go unnoticed among the established aristocracy. In 1468, the discontented Warwick named the Earl of Devon as a courtier with undue influence on King Edward. Warwick and Devon were later reconciled, but the next year Warwick repeated his accusations once more.Hicks (1998), pp. 265, 271. In an act of rebellion by proxy, Warwick instigated an insurrection in Yorkshire led by a \\"Robin of Redesdale\\". At the same time Warwicktogether with George, Duke of Clarence, King Edward's brotherstaged an invasion of the country from Warwick's stronghold of Calais. Devon, together with William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, was ordered to gather troops to quell the rebellion. Warwick's rebellion ended with his death in the Battle of Barnet in 1471, here depicted in a late-15th-century manuscript illustration.Hicks (1998), p. 310. The royal army under Devon and Pembroke intercepted the northern rebelson their way south to meet up with Warwick and Clarenceby Banbury in Oxfordshire. It is not clear what happened after this. According to Warkworth, Devon and Pembroke quarrelled over billeting arrangements, and Devon took off with the majority of the archers. The next day, on 26 July 1469, Pembroke met the rebels at the Battle of Edgecote, but without artillery support he was thoroughly defeated. When Devon finally arrived, he was either unable to engage his troops, or too late to make a difference.Ross (1997), p. 131. The French chronicler Jean de Waurin, however, gives a different account. According to Waurin, Devon left the field of battle once he heard news that Clarence was arriving with reinforcements. In either case, Pembroke was captured and executed on Warwick's order. Devon managed to escape, but was later captured by a mob at Bridgwater in Somerset, and executed on 17 August. Humphrey Stafford had been Earl of Devon for exactly three months at the time of his death. He and Isabel had no children, so when he died his title became extinct. It was restored the next year for John Courtenay, the brother of Thomas, the last Courtenay earl of Devon. Stafford was buried in Glastonbury Abbey, and a dispute over his lands followed between his cousins. Stafford was considered over-ambitious and unscrupulous by many contemporaries. This can be seen both by Warkworth implicating him in the downfall of Henry Courtenay, and Warwick targeting him as one of King Edward's evil councillors. This thread has also been picked up by modern historians; Charles Ross calls him a \\"greedy and ambitious man\\".Ross (1997), p. 78. At the same time, his skills as an administrator can hardly be doubted, as evidenced by King Edward's heavy reliance on him. He could also show a more human and sympathetic side.

MDCCXXX.\\" The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town is a play by the English playwright and novelist Henry Fielding, first performed on 30 March 1730 at the Little Theatre, Haymarket. Written in response to the Theatre Royal's rejection of his earlier plays, The Author's Farce was Fielding's first theatrical success. The Little Theatre allowed Fielding the freedom to experiment, and to alter the traditional comedy genre. The play ran during the early 1730s and was altered for its run starting 21 April 1730 and again in response to the Actor Rebellion of 1733. Throughout its life, the play was coupled with several different plays, including The Cheats of Scapin and Fielding's Tom Thumb. The first and second acts deal with the attempts of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled The Pleasures of the Town, about the Goddess Nonsense's choice of a husband from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which the characters in the puppet play are portrayed by humans. The Author's Farce ends with a merging of the play's and the puppet show's realities. The play established Fielding as a popular London playwright, and the press reported that seats were in great demand. Although largely ignored by critics until the 20th century, most agree that the play is primarily a commentary on events in Fielding's life, signalling his transition from older forms of comedy to the new satire of his contemporaries. Fielding's play within a play satirised the way in which the London theatre scene, in his view, abused the literary public by offering new and inferior genres. The Author's Farce is now considered to be a critical success and a highly skilled satire. Plot Most of Fielding's plays were written in five acts, but The Author's Farce was written in three. The opening introduces the main character, Harry Luckless, and his attempts to woo Harriot, the daughter of his landlady Mrs. Moneywood. The play begins in much the same way as Fielding's earlier romance-themed comedies, but quickly becomes a different type of play, mocking the literary and theatrical establishment.Rivero 1989 pp. 35‚Äì36 Luckless is trying to become a successful writer, but lacks the income that would allow him to concentrate on his writing. Although others try to support him financially, Luckless refuses their help; when his friend, Witmore, pays his rent behind his back, Luckless steals the money from Mrs. Moneywood. In the second act, Luckless seeks assistance to help finish his play, The Pleasures of the Town, but is poorly advised, and the work is rejected by his local theatre. Luckless revises his play and succeeds in finding an alternative venue,Pagliaro 1999 pp. 70‚Äì71 leading to the third act, in which the work is performed as a puppet show, with actors taking the place of the puppets.Rivero 1989 p. 37 The third act is dominated by the puppet show, a play within the play. It begins when the Goddess of Nonsense chooses a mate from a series of suitors along the River Styx. All dunces, the suitors include Dr. Orator, Sir Farcical Comic, Mrs. Novel, Bookseller, Poet, Monsieur Pantomime, Don Tragedio and Signior Opera.Pagliaro 1999 pp. 71‚Äì72 The goddess eventually chooses a foreign castrato opera singer as her favourite ‚Äî Signior Opera ‚Äî after he sings an aria about money. Mrs. Novel then claims that she loved Signior Opera, and died giving birth to his child.Campbell 1995 p. 33 At this revelation, the goddess becomes upset, but is quick to forgive. The play within the play is interrupted by Constable and Murdertext, who arrive to arrest Luckless \\"for abusing Nonsense\\",Lockwood 2004 p. 282 but Mrs. Novel persuades Murdertext to let the play finish. Someone from the land of Bantam then arrives to tell Luckless that he is the prince of Bantam. News follows that the King of Bantam has died, and that Luckless is to be made the new king. The play concludes with the revelation that Luckless's landlady is in reality the Queen of \\"Old Brentford\\" and that her daughter, Harriot, is now royalty.Pagliaro 1999 p. 72 An epilogue in which four poets discuss how the play should end is brought to a conclusion by a cat, in the form of a woman.Hunter 1975 p. 54 Themes Fielding uses Luckless and The Author's Farce to portray aspects of his life, including his experience with the London theatre community.Pagliaro 1999 pp. 69‚Äì70 The plot serves as revenge for the Theatre Royal's rejection of Fielding's earlier plays.Koon 1986 p. 123 However, this and his being forced into minor theatres proved beneficial, because it allowed him more freedom to experiment with his plays in ways that would have been unacceptable at larger locations. This experimentation, beginning with The Author's Farce,Rivero 1989 p. 23 is an attempt by Fielding to try writing in formats beyond the standard five-act comedy play. Though he returned to writing five-act plays later, many of his plays contain plot structures that differ from those common to contemporary plays. To distinguish his satirical intent, Fielding claims that the work was written by \\"Scriblerus Secundus,\\" which places his play within an earlier literary tradition. The name refers to the Scriblerus Club, a satirical group whose members included Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, John Gay, and John Arbuthnot.Rivero 1989 pp. 31‚Äì34 Fielding's use of the pseudonym connects his play to the satirical writings of the Scriblerus Club's members, and reveals their influence on his new style,Lockwood 2004 p. 189 such as incorporating in their work the styles of the entertainments that they were ridiculing. Fielding thus allows the audience to believe that he is poking fun at others, less discriminating than themselves, and less able to distinguish good art from bad.Rivero 1989 pp. 34‚Äì35 Fielding also borrowed characters from the work of the Club's members, such as the Goddess of Nonsense, influenced by Pope's character from The Dunciad, Dulness, who is at war with reason.Pagliaro 1999 p. 71 Nonsense, like Dulness, is a force that promotes the corruption of literature and taste, to which Fielding adds a sexual element. This sexuality is complicated, yet also made comical, when Nonsense chooses a castrated man as her mate. Her choice emphasises a lack of morality, one of the problems that Fielding believed dominated 18th-century British society.Campbell 1995 pp. 32‚Äì34 Despite the link to Dulness, the general satire of the play more closely resembles Gay's Beggar's Opera than the other works produced by the Scriblerus Club.Warner 1998 p. 242 The Author's Farce is not a standard comedy; rather, it is a farce, and as such employs petty forms of humour like slapstick. Instead of relying on rhetorical wit, Fielding incorporates dramatic incongruities. For example, actors play puppets in a life-size version of a puppet play. Fielding's purpose in relying on the farce tradition was specifically to criticise society as a whole.Rivero 1989 pp. 38‚Äì41 Like others, Fielding believed that there was a decline in popular theatre related to the expansion of its audience, therefore he satirises it, its audiences, and its writers throughout The Author's Farce.Freeman 2002 pp. 59‚Äì63 Speaking of popular entertainment in London, Fielding's character Luckless claims, \\"If you must write, write nonsense, write operas, write entertainments, write Hurlothrumbos, set up an Oratory and preach nonsense, and you may meet with encouragement enough.\\"Fielding 1967 p. 16 Luckless's only ambition is to become successful. Many of the characters in the play believe that the substance of a play matters little as long as it can earn a profit. Harriot believes that the only important characteristic of a lover is his merit, which, to her, is his ability to become financially successful.Rivero 1989 pp. 33‚Äì37 Fielding later continues this line of attacks on audiences, morality, and genres when he criticises Samuel Richardson's epistolary novel Pamela, in which a nobleman makes advances upon a servant-maid with the intent of making her his mistress.Warner 1998 p. 241Castro-Santana 2016 pp 637-41 The blending of the fictional and real worlds at the end of the play represents the inability of individuals to distinguish between fictional and real experience.Freeman 2002 pp. 64‚Äì65 The final act of the play also serves as Fielding's defence of traditional hierarchical views of literature. He satirises new literary genres with low standards by using personified versions of them during the puppet show.Ingrassia 2004 pp. 21‚Äì22 In particular, Fielding mocks how contemporary audiences favoured Italian opera,Roose-Evans 1977 p. 35 a dramatic form that he regarded with contempt. Fielding considered it \\"a foreign intruder that has weaned the public from their native entertainments\\".van der Voorde 1966 p. 96 The character Signior Opera, the image of the favoured castrato singer within the puppet show, is a parody of the foreigners who performed as singers, along with the audiences that accepted them. Additionally, the character serves as a source of humour that targets 18th-century literary genres; after the character Nonsense chooses the castrato Signior Opera as her husband, Mrs Novel objects, declaring that she gave birth to his child. This act would be physically impossible because Opera is a castrato, and it pokes fun at how the genres and the public treated such individuals. Fielding was not alone in using the castrato image for humour and satire; William Hogarth connects the castrato singer with politics and social problems,Campbell 1995 pp. 33‚Äì34 and many other contemporary works mock women who favour eunuchs.Campbell 1995 pp. 32‚Äì36 Sources Lord Foppingtonalt=Black and white image of a man facing centre. He is wearing a shoulder length wig, has an elaborate coat with a cloth around his neck. He has a hat under his left arm and both a glove and a watch in his left hand. He is holding up his right hand with the thumb and pointer pressed together. Many aspects of the play are drawn from Fielding's own experiences. During Act II, the characters Marplay and Sparkish, two theatre managers, offer poor advice to Luckless on how to improve his play, which they then reject. This fictional event mirrors Fielding's own life when Colley Cibber and Robert Wilks of the Theatre Royal rejected The Temple Beau. Cibber was an inspiration for the character of Marplay and Wilks for Sparkish, but Sparkish does not appear in the revised version of 1734, after Wilks's death. In his place Fielding introduces a character who mocks Theophilus Cibber, Colley's son, and his role in the Actor Rebellion of 1733.Pagliaro 1999 p. 70 Another biographical parallel involves the relationship between Luckless and Mrs Moneywood, which is similar to Fielding's own relationship with Jan Oson, his landlord during his stay in Leiden in early 1729. There Fielding incurred a debt of about ¬£13 (equivalent to about ¬£1,760 as of 2008), and a legal case was brought against him. Abandoning his personal property, Fielding fled to London; Oson's seizure of Fielding's possessions mirrors Mrs Moneywood's threats to seize those belonging to Luckless.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 72‚Äì73 Other characters are modelled on well-known personalities of whom Fielding was aware though they were not personal acquaintances:: Mrs Novel is Eliza Haywood, a writer, actress, and publisher; Signior Opera is Senesino, a famous Italian contralto castrato;Freeman 2002 pp. 62‚Äì63 Bookweight is similar to Edmund Curll, a bookseller and publisher known for unscrupulous publication and publicity;Rawson 2008 p. 23 Orator is John Henley, a clergyman, entertainer, and well-known orator; Monsieur Pantomime is John Rich, a director and theatre manager; and Don Tragedio is Lewis Theobald, an editor and author. Sir Farcical Comick is another version of Colley Cibber, but only in his role as an entertainer.Hume 1988 p. 64 Fielding drew inspiration from many literary sources and traditions as well as from his own life. The structure and plot of The Author's Farce are similar to those of George Farquhar's Love and a Bottle (1698), in that both plays describe the relationship between an author and his landlady. The plays only deal with the same generalised idea however; the particulars of each are different. Fielding also drew on the Scriblerus Club's use of satire and the humour common to traditional Restoration and Augustan drama. Many of Luckless's situations are similar to those found within various traditional British dramas, including Buckingham's The Rehearsal (1672), a satirical play about staging a play. It is possible that Pope's Dunciad Variorum, published on 13 March 1729, influenced the themes of the play and the plot of the puppet show. The Court of Nonsense in the puppet show are related to the Court of Dulness in The Dunciad and the Court of Nonsense in John Dryden's Mac Flecknoe. The Scriblerus Club style of humour as a whole influences The Author's Farce, and it is possible that Fielding borrowed from Gay's Three Hours after Marriage (1717) and The Beggar's Opera (1728).Lockwood 2004 pp. 188‚Äì190 In turn, Fielding's play influenced later Scriblerus Club works, especially Pope's fourth book of his revised Dunciad and possibly Gay's The Rehearsal at Goatham.Lockwood 2004 p. 205 Performance history and publication Henry Fielding The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town was written during 1729.Hume 1988 p. 63 The first press announcement of the play appeared on 18 March 1730 in the Daily Post, stating that it was in rehearsal. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper shortly afterwards mentioning restricted seating and high ticket prices, suggesting that the play was expected to be a popular entertainment. It opened on Easter Monday, 30 March 1730, at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and shortly thereafter was billed alongside The Cheats of Scapin. The last act was later made into the companion piece to Hurlothrumbo for one show.Lockwood 2004 pp. 192‚Äì193 Fielding altered and rewrote The Author's Farce for its second run beginning on 21 April 1730, when it shared the bill with his earlier play Tom Thumb. This combination continued through May and June and was later billed for a revival on 3 July 1730. Starting on 1 August 1730, the third act of The Author's Farce was revived by the Little Theatre during the week of the Tottenham Court fair. On 17 October 1730 an advertisement in the Daily Post announced that a new prologue was to be added. A version without the prologue followed before the play's run ended, to be replaced by The Beggar's Wedding by Charles Coffey. The Author's Farce was briefly revived in November 1730 and January 1731, but only the first two acts of the play were shown. It was paired with the afterpiece Damon and Phillida, which was later replaced by The Jealous Taylor in January 1731. Performances continued into February and March 1731. Productions in 1732 included a new prologue, now lost, that had been added for the 10 May 1731 performance.Lockwood 2004 pp. 194‚Äì196 On 31 March 1731, The Author's Farce was paired with the Tom Thumb remake, The Tragedy of Tragedies, as a replacement for The Letter Writers, the original companion piece. Although both Tragedy of Tragedies and The Author's Farce were main shows, they alternated on the billing until the 18 June 1731 performance, the final showing of any Fielding play in the Little Theatre except for a 12 May 1732 benefit show of The Author's Farce. The last documented non-puppet version was performed on 28 March 1748 by Theophilus Cibber as a two-act companion piece for a benefit show. The Pleasures of the Town act was performed as a one-act play outside London throughout the century, including a 15-show run at Norwich in 1749 and during the 1750s, and a production at York during the 1751‚Äì52 theatre season. Additionally, there were benefit shows that included the third act at a variety of locations, including Dublin, on 19 December 1763 and Edinburgh in 1763.Lockwood 2004 pp. 196‚Äì197 There were also many performances of the puppet theatre versions, including a travelling show by Thomas Yeates, titled Punch's Oratory, or The Pleasures of the Town, which started in 1734.Speaight 1990 p. 157 In response to the Actor Rebellion of 1733, Fielding produced a revised version of The Author's Farce, incorporating a new prologue and epilogue. Performed at the Theatre Royal, it was advertised in the Daily Journal, opening with an inferior replacement cast for some of the important characters. It was joined by The Intriguing Chambermaid and The Harlot's Progress. These were the only performances of the revised version, which was printed together with The Intriguing Chambermade (1734) and included a letter by an unknown writer, possibly Fielding himself.Lockwood 2004 pp. 194‚Äì199 The 1734 edition of the play was printed in 1750, and it was used for all later publications until 1966. Printed texts of the play were included in Arthur Murphy's 1762 Works of Henry Fielding and George Saintsbury's 1893 Works of Henry Fielding. The latter includes The Author's Farce along with only two other plays. The 1903 Works of Henry Fielding, edited by G. H. Maynadier, included only the first two acts.Lockwood 2004 pp. 204‚Äì206 Only three scenes were included in Alfred Howard's The Beauties of Fielding, which collected passages from Fielding's works. George Saintsbury included The Author's Farce and two other plays in a Fielding collected edition of 1893, but ignored the others.Lockwood 2004 pp. 205‚Äì206 Critical response The success of The Author's Farce established Fielding as a London playwright;Rivero 1989 p. 31 writing in 1998, Harold Pagliaro describes the play as Fielding's \\"first great success\\".Pagliaro 1998 p. 69 Catherine Ingrassia, in 2004, attributes its popularity to Fielding's satirical attack on the archetypal woman writer, specifically Haywood.Ingrassia 2004 p. 106 Among contemporary accounts the Daily Post of 2 May 1730 reported that the play received universal approval, and on 6 May that seats were in great demand. The 7 May issue of the Grub Street Journal noted that the play was popular among \\"Persons of Quality\\"; many notable figures attended the show, including on the first night John Perceval, 1st Earl of Egmont, and Frederick, Prince of Wales, whose presence was mentioned in the 28 April 1730 London Evening Post and the 15 May 1730 Daily Post.Lockwood 2004 pp. 194‚Äì195 The only surviving comments from any of those who saw the play come from the diary of the Earl of Egmont, who reported that The Author's Farce and Tom Thumb \\"are a ridicule on poets, several of their works, as also of operas, etc., and the last of our modern tragedians, and are exceedingly full of humour, with some wit.\\"Lockwood 2004 qtd p. 204 The play was hardly discussed at all during the 18th century, and the 19th century mostly followed the same trend. A chapter on the play is included in Frederick Lawrence's Life of Fielding (1855), and it is mentioned by Leslie Stephen and Austin Dobson, who focus on what the play says about Grub Street and Fielding. Most later critics agree with Dobson's judgement that the play primarily provides a commentary on events in Fielding's life, and marks his transition from older forms of comedy to the new satire of his contemporaries.Lockwood 2004 p. 206 Charles Woods, writing in 1966, argues that The Author's Farce was an integral part of Fielding's career, and dismisses a political reading of the work.Woods 1966 p. XV Some years earlier, in 1918, Wilbur Lucius Cross had held that the play revealed Fielding's talent for writing farces and burlesques.Cross 1918 p. 80 Writing in 1993, Martin and Ruthe Battestin maintain that the play \\"was [Fielding's] first experiment in the irregular comic modes ... where his true genius as a playwright at last found scope\\". They further assert that Fielding was the first to offer audiences \\"a kind of pointed, inventive foolery\\", and that his talent for \\"ridicule and brisk dialogue\\" and for devising \\"absurd yet expressionistic plots\\" was unmatched even in 20th-century theatre.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 83 Earlier, Frederick Homes Dudden, had described the puppet show in the third act as \\"a highly original satire on the theatrical and quasi-theatrical amusements of the day.\\"Dudden 1966 p. 54 F. W. Bateson included the play in his 1963 list of \\"satirical extravaganzas\\".Bateson 1963 pp. 121‚Äì126 J. Paul Hunter, in his 1975 comparison of Fielding's theatrical style and form, notes that while \\"many of the literary and theatrical jibes are witty,\\" the slow pacing and lack of dramatic conflict make the play seem \\"essentially untheatrical\\".Hunter 1975 p. 53 Pat Rogers disagrees, reasoning that \\"Few livelier theatrical occasions can ever have been seen than the original runs of The Author's Farce, with their mixture of broad comedy, personal satire, tuneful scenes and rapid action.\\"Rogers 1979 p. 49 Robert Hume, in 1988, comments that the literary structure of The Author's Farce is \\"ramshackle but effective\\",Hume 1988 pp. 63‚Äì64 although he considers that \\"Fielding's parody of recognition scenes is done with verve\\" and \\"the 'realistic' part of the show is a clever combination of the straightforward and the ironic.\\"Hume 1988 pp. 64‚Äì65 Writing in 1998, Thomas Lockwood explains various aspects that make the play great, putting particular emphasis on the \\"musical third act\\", which he believes \\"shows a gift for brilliant theatrical arrangement\\". Lockwood praises the play's conclusion in particular, and the ever-increasing tempo of events following Murdertext's \\"explosive invasion\\".Lockwood 2004 p. 212 Cast1730 cast= Play:Fielding 2004 p. 227 * Harry Luckless ‚Äì playwright, played by Mr. Mullart (William Mullart) * Harriot Moneywood ‚Äì daughter of Mrs. Moneywood, played by Miss Palms * Mrs Moneywood ‚Äì Luckless's landlady, played by Mrs. Mullart (Elizabeth Mullart) * Witmore ‚Äì played by Mr. Lacy (James Lacy) * Marplay ‚Äì played by Mr. Reynolds * Sparkish ‚Äì played by Mr. Stopler * Bookweight ‚Äì played by Mr. Jones * Scarecrow ‚Äì played by Mr. Marshal * Dash ‚Äì played by Mr. Hallam * Quibble ‚Äì played by Mr. Dove * Blotpage ‚Äì played by Mr. Wells junior * Jack ‚Äì Luckless's servant, played by Mr. Achurch * Jack-Pudding ‚Äì played by Mr. Reynolds * Bantomite ‚Äì played by Mr. Marshal Internal puppet show:Fielding 2004 pp. 227‚Äì228 * Player ‚Äì by Mr. Dove * Constable ‚Äì by Mr. Wells * Murder-text ‚Äì by Mr. Hallam * Goddess of Nonsense ‚Äì by Mrs. Mullart * Charon ‚Äì by Mr. Ayres * Curry ‚Äì by Mr. Dove * A Poet ‚Äì by Mr. W.

It was added on 24 April 1730 at Haymarket. It is a low tragedy about a character who is small in both size and status who is granted the hand of a princess in marriage. This infuriates the queen and a member of the court and the play chronicles their attempts to ruin the marriage. The play incorporated part of the satire in The Author's Farce and also was a farce because the tragedies in the play became absurd. Additionally, Fielding explored many issues with gender roles through his portrayals of characters. Critics largely enjoyed the play and noted its success through comedy. As the play later was edited to become the Tragedy of Tragedies, critics like Alberto Rivero noted its impact on Fielding's later plays. Background Tom Thumb was added to the ninth showing of The Author's Farce that took place on 24 April 1730. Together, the shows lasted at the Haymarket until they were replaced by Fielding's next production, Rape upon Rape. They later were revived together on 3 July 1730 for one night. Tom Thumb was also included with other productions, including Rape upon Rape for 1 July 1730, and was incorporated into the Haymarket company's shows outside of the theatre on 4 and 14 September 1730 at various fairs. It was later turned into the Tragedy of Tragedies.Rivero 1989 p. 53 When the play was no longer featured alongside of The Author's Farce, the satire becomes less evident. To combat this problem, Fielding added other components, including footnotes, prefaces, and prologues, to the second edition of the written version.Rivero 1989 p. 57 This is another component that Tom Thumb shares with The Tragedy of Tragedies, and an aspect common to Fielding's so-called 'Scriblerus plays', which incorporate the use of H. Scriblerus Secundus as a pen name for the print editions.Rivero 1989 p. 75 A revised edition of the play was published with a few alterations, including adding two scenes, Prologue, Epilogue, and Preface. Another revision came on 30 November 1730 and added another act to follow Act II, Scene 9. This act attacked Colley Cibber's recent appointment as the Poet Laureate. The new Act, titled The Battle of the Poets, or, The Contention for the Laurel, was published on its on 17 December 1730. However, this act was not Henry Fielding's; it is attributed to Thomas Cooke but authorship was never proven.Dudden 1966 pp. 58‚Äì59 Cast Cast according to the printed billing:Fielding 2004 p. 385 * Tom Thumb ‚Äì played by Miss Jones * King Arthur ‚Äì played by Mr. Mullart * Princess Huncamunca ‚Äì King Arthur's daughter, played by Mrs. Jones * Queen Dollalolla ‚Äì King Arthur's wife, played by Mrs. Mullart * Lord Grizzle ‚Äì played by Mr. Jones * Mr. Doodle ‚Äì played by Mr. Marshall * Mr. Noodle ‚Äì played by Mr. Reynolds * 1st Physician ‚Äì played by Mr. Hallam * 2nd Physician ‚Äì played by Mr. Dove * Cleora ‚Äì played by Mrs. Smith * Mustacha ‚Äì played by Mrs. Clark * Other characters include Courtiers, Slaves, Bailiffs and others. * Prologue spoken by Mr. JonesFielding 2004 p. 381 * Epilogue spoken by Miss JonesFielding 2004 p. 383 Plot Fielding, writing as Scriblerus Secondus, prefaces the play by explaining his choice of Tom Thumb as his subject: > It is with great Concern that I have observed several of our (the > Grubstreet) Tragical Writers, to Celebrate in their Immortal Lines the > Actions of Heroes recorded in Historians and Poets, such as Homer or Virgil, > Livy or Plutarch, the Propagation of whose Works is so apparently against > the Interest of our Society; when the Romances, Novels, and Histories vulgo > call'd Story-Books, of our own People, furnish such abundance and proper > Themes for their Pens, such are Tom Tram, Hickathrift &c.;Fielding 1970 p. > 18 Fielding reverses the tragic plot by focusing on a character who is small in both size and status. The play is a low tragedy that describes Tom Thumb arriving at King Arthur's court showing off giants that he defeated. As a reward, Arthur grants Tom the hand of princess Huncamunca, which upsets both his wife, Dollalolla, and a member of the court, Grizzle. The two plot together to ruin the marriage, which begins the tragedy.Rivero 1989 pp. 61‚Äì62 Part way through the play, two doctors begin to discuss the death of Tom Thumb and resort to using fanciful medical terminology and quoting ancient medical works with which they are not familiar. However, it becomes apparent that it was not Tom who died, but a monkey.Rivero 1989 p. 69 The tragedy becomes farcical when Tom is devoured by a cow. This is not the end of Tom, because his ghost later suffers a second death at the hands of Grizzle.Rivero 1989 p. 63 Then, one by one, the other characters farcically kill each other, leaving only the king at the end to kill himself.TOM THUMB, A TRAGEDY by HENRY FIELDING, Rochester University Library Themes Tom Thumb incorporates part of the satire found within The Author's Farce: the mocking of the heroic tragedy that has little substance beyond dramatic cliche. The satire originates in a play within The Author's Farce in which the character Goddess of Nonsense selects from various manifestations of bad art; of the manifestations, Don Tragedio is the one selected as the basis for the satire within Tom Thumb. Fielding, in following the \\"Don Tragedio\\" style, creates a play that denies the tradition and seeks newness within theatre only for newness's sake, regardless of the logical absurdities that result.Rivero 1989 pp. 54‚Äì55 In Tom Thumb and Tragedy of Tragedies, Fielding emphasises abuses of the English language in his character's dialogues, by removing meaning or adding fake words to the dialogue, to mimic and mock the dialogues of Colley Cibber's plays.Rivero 1989 p. 63 The satire of Tom Thumb reveals that the problem with contemporary tragedy is its unconscious mixture of farcical elements. This results from the tragedians lacking a connection to the tradition of tragedy and their incorporation of absurd details or fanciful elements that remove any realism within the plot. It is also possible that some of these tragedians clung to the tradition in a way that caused them to distort many of the elements, which result in farcical plots. These tragedies become humorous because of their absurdities, and Tom Thumb pokes fun at such tragedies while becoming one itself. The satire of the play can also be interpreted as a deconstruction of tragedy in general. Fielding accomplishes the breaking down and exposing of the flaws of Tragedy through showing that the genre is already breaking down itself. However, Fielding's purpose in revealing the breakdown is to encourage the reversal of it.Rivero 1989 pp. 55‚Äì58 Besides critiquing various theatrical traditions, there are gender implications of the dispute between King Arthur and his wife, Queen Dollalolla, over which of the females should have Tom as their own. There are parallels between King Arthur with King George and Queen Dollalolla with Queen Caroline, especially with a popular belief that Queen Caroline controlled the decisions of King George. The gender roles were further complicated and reversed by the masculine Tom Thumb being portrayed by a female during many of the shows. This reversal allows Fielding to critique the traditional understanding of a hero within tragedy and gender roles in general. Ultimately, gender was a way to comment on economics, literature, politics, and society as a whole.Campbell 1995 pp. 19‚Äì20 Response Jonathan Swift, when witnessing the death of Tom's ghost, was reported in the memoirs of Mrs. Pilkington to have laughed out loud; such a feat was rare for Swift and this was only the second time such an occurrence was said to have happened.Hillhouse 1918 note p. 150 J. Paul Hunter argues that the whole play \\"depends primarily on one joke\\", which is the diminutive size of the main character.Hunter 1975 p. 23 F. Homes Dudden characterises the play as \\"a merry burlesque\\" and points out that the play was \\"a huge success\\".Dudden 1966 pp. 56‚Äì57 Albert Rivero points out that the ignoring of Tom Thumb for its expanded and transformed version, Tragedy of Tragedies, \\"is a regrettable oversight because Tom Thumb constitutes a vital link in Fielding's dramatic career, its importance lying not so much in its later expansion into Scriblerian complexity as in its debt to, and departure from, the play it followed on stage for thirty-three nights in 1730.\\"Rivero 1989 pp. 53‚Äì54 NotesReferences * Campbell, Jill.

It operated under the governance of BC Mental Health & Addiction Services when it closed in July 2012. In December 2015, the provincial government announced plans to replace the obsolete buildings with new mental health facilities scheduled to open in about 2019. As of 2019, several unsafe buildings have been torn down but no new construction has started. At one time Riverview Hospital was known as Essondale Hospital, for Dr. Henry Esson Young (1862-1939) who played an important role in establishing the facility. The neighbourhood where the hospital is located also became known as the Essondale neighbourhood. History In 1876, Royal Hospital in Victoria was converted to British Columbia's first facility to house mentally ill patients. Due to crowding, Royal Hospital was closed and the patients moved to the new Provincial Asylum for the Insane in 1878. Again facing problems of overcrowding at the turn of the century, in 1904 the provincial government purchased in then-rural Coquitlam for the construction of Riverview Hospital and the adjacent Colony Farm lands. Construction of a temporary ‚ÄúHospital for the Mind‚Äù was started at the Riverview property in 1909. In 1911 British Columbia's first Provincial Botanist, John Davidson, established an arboretum, nursery and a botanical garden on the hospital lands, often with the assistance of patients as there was a belief in the therapeutic value.Botany John Virtual Museum Website: Retrieved on 27 April 2010, The botanical garden was moved to the new University of British Columbia in 1916, but the arboretum and nursery remained.Teachers Law Institutes: History of Riverview Retrieved on 2 May 2009 In 1913 a permanent Provincial mental hospital, administered by Dr. Henry Esson Young was opened, treating about 300 seriously mentally-ill male patients. The building was originally constructed to hold 480 patients, but by the end of the year it housed 919. By this time, Colony Farm was producing over 700 tons of crops and 20,000 gallons of milk in a year, using mostly patient labour. In 1950 the hospital property was renamed West Lawn. In 1983 the West Lawn building was demolished, and the land sold to the city of Coquitlam to form the Riverview Heights subdivision. In 1924, the Acute Psychopathic Unit, later called Centre Lawn, opened. Several hospital staff lived at the remote site, and by 1927 this had grown into a small community called Essondale; including shops, a school, and Fire Hall. In 1930, the 675-bed Female Chronic Unit (later called East Lawn) opened due to overcrowding. The first phase of what would eventually be called the Crease Clinic, the Veteran's Unit opened in 1934, with the second phase opened in 1949, giving Riverview its most iconic building. Finally in 1955, the Tuberculosis Unit (now called North Lawn) opened, marking the peak of patient residence. By 1956 the hospital had reached 4,306 patients. In 1959 the charge of mental health services was transferred from the Provincial Secretary to the newly formed Department of Health Services. The transfer was followed by a transition from custodial care to the more active psychiatric care of patients. In 1967 Dr. Davidson resigned as Deputy Minister and was replaced by Dr F.G. Tucker, a resident physician of Essondale (Riverview) from 1953 who, in 1959, became the Clinical Director of the Crease Clinic. A steady decline in beds and facilities started in the 1960s and continued up to 2004 at which point there were only 800 beds. Some say that the reason for the decreasing number was initially due to the introduction of anti-psychotic medications and the development of psychiatric units in acute care hospitals as well as a move toward outpatient care. As early as 1967 a decision had been made to downsize Riverview Hospital. The determination was first brought up officially on paper three years after the publication of the Mental Health Act of 1964 that intended to have mental health care be as readily available to the population as that of physical health. The two acts worked in conjunction so that by 1970 there were 17 Mental Health Centres in British Columbia, 12 of which had opened within the previous four years. Decreases continued. In 1969 the Provincial Government appointed a committee to review the role of the Mental Health Branch of social services in British Columbia. The committee decided to further downsize Riverview in a stated plan to implement other community care centres. As further closures were being planned, legislation was also passed in 1969 that deemed Riverview an ‚Äúopen hospital‚Äù allowing private practitioners to send their patients to Riverview. A shift away from directors trained in psychiatry to administrative ones was marked. As services and beds at Riverview continuously decreased, while opening access of it through private practice, another official plan to entirely close Riverview Hospital was written in 1987: A Draft Plan to Replace Riverview Hospital. Crease Clinic Regional clinics began drawing patients from Riverview, and both advances in treatment and eventual cutbacks in funding resulted in fewer people receiving mental health care province-wide. In 1983, West Lawn closed and farming operations at Colony Farm were discontinued. In 1984, the provincial government sold of Riverview lands to Molnar Developments. Shortly afterward, this land was subdivided and became Riverview Heights, with about 250 single family homes. In 1985 an acute geriatric unit was opened at Riverview Hospital. In 1988 management of the hospital was officially transferred from the directors to a board of provincially appointed trustees. The shift was an anticipated one, as the Report of the Mental Health Planning Survey of 1979 states: ‚ÄúWhat began as the sensible idea of using non-medical, trained administers for administrative tasks, has subtly become the use of untrained non-medical administrators, and a simultaneous denial of the psychiatrist's role in clinical leadership.\\" The shift had been happening from the early 1960s and has been argued to be one of the reasons for the 1969 committee's decision to downsize Riverview and decrease funding. The board, as far less experienced in psychiatry than the original managers who held doctorates and who were trained psychiatrists, were again replaced in 1992 by another board without trustees that was said to give a broader representation of concerns including those of consumers [patients], businesses, and union and community agencies. By 1990 the decision had officially been made to reduce Riverview to a 358-bed facility with the presumed intention of opening regional care facilities throughout the province as stated in the Mental Health Initiative. In 1992 Listening: A Review of Riverview Report was published as an attempt to resolve the complaints of patients and their family members that had gone ignored for years. The report ‚Äúemphasizes that a full assessment of patients' decision-making abilities and personal support network is necessary, and that a patient be notified and given an opportunity to object before an incapability certificate is completed.‚Äù The new rights of patients was implemented less than a decade before the hospital was entirely shut down. Also in 1992, the Crease Clinic closed. In 1992 the Riverview Heights Horticultural Society was formed to preserve the remnants of the botanical garden, and to advocate for John Davidson's vision of psychological therapy through horticulture. By the year 2002 there were 800 beds in all of Riverview. In 2004 it was stated that by 2007, 400 new beds would open in other areas of British Columbia for mental health services but places and dates went unmentioned. Neither did the report state how many beds would be removed from Riverview. In 2005 the East Lawn building closed, in 2007 the North Lawn building was closed, and in 2012 the last patients were moved from Centre Lawn, and Riverview Hospital closed. Evidently the number of beds taken away and the number of beds stated to be implemented, and the smaller amount that were actually implemented do not even out to the amount of beds that were closed at Riverview. Other buildings on Riverview Hospital grounds continued as mental health facilities. In 2005, the city's task force on the hospital lands rejected the idea of further housing on the lands and declared that the lands and buildings should be protected and remain as a mental health facility.City of Coquitlam: Riverview Hospital Lands Retrieved on 15 February 2009 In 2009, Riverview Hospital was added to the Canadian Register of Historic Places. Other mental health facilities have been constructed on the Riverview grounds, the first being Connolly Lodge, which opened 1 March 2002; Cottonwood Lodge opened a few years later, and Cypress Lodge on 23 April 2010. Together these three lodges have beds for 64 patients. In addition, 12 Cottages are still in use as transitional housing for patients from the Forensic Hospital and the Brookside and Hillside buildings host a 35-bed residential Rehabilitation and Recovery program run by Coast Mental Health for patients with concurrent disorders.https://www.coastmentalhealth.com/what-we- do/pillar-housing/ The construction of a provincially-funded $101 million mental health and addiction treatment facility on the Riverview grounds began in 2017 and is planned to open its doors in 2021. It will house 105 patients and provide specialized care for adults with severe and complex mental health and addiction challenges.http://dailyhive.com/vancouver/riverview-hospital- mental-health-addiction-facility-2017  Units before closure Industrial Therapy Building= The Industrial Therapy Building was implemented in 1963 with a total cost of $505,000. Patients were assigned for instruction and training in a selected shop. The shops included: Cabinet, upholstery, furniture finishing, metal, printing, electronics, machine, mattresses, tailor, and shoemaking. It was said that the program was of use to the patients as they would need vocations when they were to resume life in the community. The shops were supposed to give them skills to work once discharged from the hospital. =Acute Geriatric Psychiatric Division= The Geriatric Psychiatry Division of Riverview Hospital was opened in 1985. A 26-bed Acute (temporary) Admissions Unit was opened. The division was intended to be the first stage of a larger implementation of geriatric services in psychiatry across British Columbia. The program focuses on social interaction and fast movement into the community and social situations. Film industry The vacant structures that used to form the hospital are now often used as filming locations for the film industry. Shows and films such as Supernatural, The X Files, Arrow, Elf, Smallville, Happy Gilmore, Prison Break, Riverdale, The Butterfly Effect, Final Destination 2 and Grave Encounters, along with many others, have made use of the Riverview property to form sets depicting a variety of scenes.https://moviemaps.org/locations/7g/ A significant portion of Deadpool 2, including the initial and final battle sequences, was filmed at Centre Lawn.https://www.tricitynews.com/news/we-are-fully-booked-bc-housing- says-of-riverview-filming-action-1.23328358 PublicationsRiverview Reminisces= Riverview Reminisces is a collection of stories and anecdotes from the staff of Riverview Hospital.

Riverview was to be reduced to a 550 medium/long term patient capacity from its then 1,306 with the resources being reallocated ‚Äúelsewhere in the community‚Äù (ibid). The process was said to constitute the following: 218 staff FTEs for case management/outpatient treatment duties, resulting in 4,360 additional units of care being available to the mental health system; 1,090 additional patient places for Community Support Programs (i.e., social/recreational and life skills/vocational); 310 additional residential care beds for mental health care divided between intermediate and special adult residential treatment facilities; 60 psychiatric acute care beds to be added to the general hospital system (ibid). Implementation was suggested to be a two-stage process. The first stage was to include the development of community residential, day program, and case management/outpatient treatment resources around the province to reduce Riverview patient population to 550 over 3 years. Additional beds in general hospitals and testing of medium/long term inpatient units in urban areas were suggested to fall under the first stage. Further implementation of the medium/longer term care units was to take place following the three years so as to conjoin with the anticipated closure of Riverview five years from that date (ibid). An orderly transitional period was deemed necessary for patients to be relocated to appropriate community settings with ‚Äúsufficient mental health staff and programs to monitor, follow-up, and promote their readjustment outside the institution‚Äù (22). The report emphasizes that implementation of the plan should be gradual and orderly with continuous monitoring to assure the system meets the needs of the mentally ill. It also repeats that there should be careful assessment and supervision of patients being transferred from Riverview Hospital‚Äîthat any transfers should be based on clinical assessment and that proper discussion with family members must take place. (ibid). Home and family care were strongly recommended in the report for geriatric patients. In the sections titled ‚ÄúSummary of Recommendations‚Äù the first two recommendations enforce the role of the families to take care of the patients. The third emphasizes the role of volunteer programs to help the mentally ill. The role of a physician, i.e., G.P. was also suggested to become the primary person to treat mental illness. Suggestion 14 states that general community services should play an important role in aiding those with mental illness. Recommendation 25 also enforces the role of general practitioners and community psychiatrists (30). As can be seen by the stated recommendations, extra finances were hoped to be avoided in the change. As well, the overall amount of finances given by the provincial government to psychiatric care was expected to decrease which is apparent in the report. Be that as it may, recommendations still distinctly states that ‚ÄúThe current level of financial resources at Riverview Hospital should be available for treatment, rehabilitation, and support of the mentally ill people transferred to community-based facilities and programs‚Äù (22). Despite financial cuts, many of the recommendations still enforce sufficient beds for the acutely mentally ill, proper assessment and supervision and sufficient education for the new careers to be offered as psychiatric care changes. Even more importantly recommendations 63 and 64 state that all programs must be in place prior to any reductions or adjustments to Riverview and that bridge funding between the psychiatric hospital and community programs must be available (32). The report, although subtly recommending a decrease in governmental financial aid for psychiatric services, repeatedly states that sufficient funding and proper care in transfers including previously implemented community resources and supervision by Riverview before and after discharge are crucial. =B.C. Housing: A Vision for Renewing Riverview= In 2015, B.C. Housing published ‚ÄúA Vision for Renewing Riverview‚ÄùA Vision for Renewing Riverview ; an initiative for developing the Riverview lands into a provincially-administered municipality including housing for the mentally-ill and for indigenous housing. As of 2019 the B.C. government has not acted upon this initiative. Impact of closure In 1992 about 8,000 of the yearly emergency admissions to Vancouver's mental health facilities were people with both drug addictions and mental illnesses. The reason is stated that ‚ÄúPort Coquitlam's Riverview Hospital is being emptied, and the sick are being thrown to the coyotes‚Äù. Joseph Noone, the clinical director psychiatrist-in-chief at Riverview in 1992 claimed that A Draft Plan to Replace Riverview Hospital had ‚Äúmagical faith that the Social Credit government would follow through on its promises to expand services in the community once they had downsized this hospital‚Äù. Noone claims that he was suspicious of the report since its publication. Noone also stated that 1,000 patients were brought in and shipped out of Riverview annually. The 1990 ‚ÄúMental Health Initiative‚Äù stated that the provincial government would invest $26 million in additional funding over the following 10 years. But only the first payment was initiated and in 1992, the second payment was 18 months overdue. The Greater Vancouver Mental Health Services had only 115 full-time workers with over 4,000 patients in the same year. Ex-patients of Riverview were often left without help or financial aid which caused them to flock toward the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. Mark Smith, director of Triage, a shelter in Vancouver stated that ‚Äúthere is zero available housing for these people ‚Äì not even flop houses‚Äù. He also says that much of the time, Riverview would try to discharge their patients right into the overnight shelter. He claims that the mass discharges were turning the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver into a mental health ghetto. He also mentioned that many of his clients that had recently been discharged from Riverview (mostly schizophrenics) would commit suicide shortly after discharge due to failure to properly medicate from lack of professional supervision. Andrew Wan, a Kitsilano mental health worker stated that in 1992, the conditions of privately run boarding homes are often no better than others. The places are run-for-profit so they skim over expenses. In 2013 the mayor of Maple Ridge stated he was concerned with the number of people with mental illness who were living on the street in the Lower Mainland. His council is pushing to re-open Riverview Hospital to help solve the problem. On September 20, 2013, the BC Government rejected the recommendation of the Union of BC Mayors to re-instate Riverview Hospital. The reason the Premier gave was that re- institutionalization is not the solution to homelessness or drug addiction. Instead there is \\"a new set of problems we need to deal with\\" (September 27, 2013 qtd by Bev Gutray and Marina Morrow). Gaps in the community health care system are what need to be addressed (September 27, 2013 Gutray and Morrow). The Valleyview building, one of the last buildings onsite to close, began to be demolished in 2016. The building has been recently altered to be used in the film Godzilla (2014) and was still in modern hospital conditions - conservationists had hopes to save the building so that it could be reopened but demolition went ahead.http://www.tricitynews.com/lifestyles/green-scene-a- disturbing-demolition-on-riverview-grounds-1.2285869 In 1994-95 expenditures on mental health services in BC were up by 34% over 1990-91. The BC government had invested the overdue money in the health care system. In April, 1996 the Vancouver Management Resource Group stated that the Vancouver Health Board was in the process of developing a budget based on the assumption that decreases in Federal transfer payments would mean a status quo or reduced budget overall for 1996/1997\\". The increased funding was very short-lived. Optimistically, the same 1996 report stated that due to numerous media reports about the crisis in the current system that suggested the downsizing of Riverview was leading to unacceptable pressure on the rest of the system, the Riverview Board recommended, and the Ministry supported to stop further downsizing of Riverview inpatient beds until the system stabilized. The press releases by the Provincial Health Services Authority indicated that conditions had improved seven years later. In 2003, three new mental health facilities had opened in Prince George, Kamloops and Victoria. Along with the new buildings 80 patients from Riverview were discharged. They did not indicate whether beds had been implemented for the patients who had already been discharged prior to the construction of the three new buildings that were immediately filled with then-Riverview patients. In 2002 there were 800 beds at Riverview. The stakeholders meeting stated that by 2007 there would be 920 specialized mental health beds located in smaller hospitals throughout British Columbia but neither dates, places, nor names were given. No mention of sites opening in the city of Vancouver were mentioned either. At the 2004 Stakeholders meeting, it was stated that there were 84 new beds in mental health housing facilities in British Columbia. From 2003 to 2004, 4 beds were officially written to have been added. At the same meeting it was stated that by 2007, over 400 newly developed mental health beds will open in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health Authorities, a 520-bed decrease from what was stated the previous year. At the same meeting President of PHSA Mental Health Services Leslie Arnold stated ‚ÄúA comprehensive transition care plan, including input from family members, is developed from each RVH patient prior to transfer‚Äù.

It was first performed at the Haymarket Theatre on 23 June 1730. The play is a love comedy that depicts the corruption rampant in politics and in the justice system. When two characters are accused of rape, they deal with the corrupt judge in separate manners. Though the play was influenced by the rape case of Colonel Francis Charteris, it used \\"rape\\" as an allegory to describe all abuses of freedom, as well as the corruption of power, though it was meant in a comedic, farcical manner. The play was not as successful as Fielding's Tom Thumb, which ran alongside Rape upon Rape. The play allowed Fielding to express his political views through comedy. Critics have both praised and critiqued the play, but they generally agree that the humour is unsuitable because it is \\"indelicate\\". Attempted adaptations of the play, including a musical and a film named after the play, have also been relatively unsuccessful. Background Rape upon Rape was a five-act comedic play that was written early 1730. It was advertised to start on 15 June 1730, but, after a delay, it first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights until 21 July 1730. It was originally shown at the Haymarket theatre without a companion play. However, it was later shown with Tom Thumb on 1 July 1730 and with Jack the Giant Killer on 10 July 1730. The play was shown four more times at the Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre during that December under a new title, The Coffee-House Politician. The first printing of the play coincided with its opening night, 23 June 1730.Fielding 2004 pp. 405‚Äì417 It was later altered, retitled The Coffee-House Politician, and featured at Lincoln's Inn Fields during the autumn. There is little information known as to why Fielding retitled the play, although Cross and Dudden both speculate that it was based on objections to the title. The play was advertised on 3 and 4 December 1730 Daily Post as a revised version, but there are no surviving manuscripts reflecting any major revisions to the play. If the play was altered by Fielding, then the changes would exist within the humour that would have become outdated. It is known that another act was added to the play, titled The Battle of the Poets, on 30 November 1730, but its author is unknown. Fielding did not like the addition and made it clear in an announcement about the play's production in the 30 November 1730 Daily Journal. During the 20th century, the play was turned into a musical titled Lock Up Your Daughters (1959), enjoying success, and the original play was later performed for 20 nights at the Soho Rep Theatre during 1983.Fielding 2004 pp. 414‚Äì417 Cast Cast according to original printed billing:Fielding 2004 p. 430 * Justice Squeezum ‚Äì played by Mr. Hippisley * Justice Worthy ‚Äì played by Mr. Ogden * Mrs. Squeezum ‚Äì played by Mrs. Bullock * Politic ‚Äì Father of Hilaret, played by Mr. Chapman * Sotmore ‚Äì played by Mr. Hulett * Hilaret ‚Äì played by Mrs. Younger * Constant ‚Äì played by Mr. Milward * Cloris ‚Äì Hilaret's maid * Ramble ‚Äì played by Mr. Walker * Isabella ‚Äì played by Mrs. Boheme * Dabble ‚Äì played by Mr. Ray * Quill ‚Äì played by Mr. H.

Boheme had to leave the play due to illness and was replaced by Thomas Chapman. Chapman's original part was filled by William Milward. Elizabeth Younger replaced Mrs Boheme as Hilaret and Mrs Boheme was given the part of Isabella instead. This action was most likely due to Boheme's illness. Charles Macklin, playing Porer and Brazencourt, met with success and ended up stealing parts of the show.Fielding 2004 p. 416 Plot The play is begun with a prologue that describes the origins of the heroic Muse who uses satire to deal with those who are villains. However, she is not limited to satire, and the heroic Muse is said to provoke individuals towards the destruction of evil in general.Rivero 1989 p. 78 After this set up, Fielding introduces a traditional comedic love plot in which Hilaret contemplates running off and marrying Constant. Her father, Politic, stops her from running off with Constant to argue about the role of private and public concerns in regards to love. Their discussion serves as a model for the actions surrounding Justice Squeezum and Justice Worthy, particularly Justice Squeezum's corruption when it comes to the judicial system, and the play promotes the need for virtue within public and private settings.Rivero 1989 pp. 80‚Äì82 As the plot progresses, Hilaret is set upon by Ramble, which provokes her to cry out \\"rape\\". During this time, Constant, in an attempt to help a woman, is also accused of rape. They are taken before Justice Squeezum, who reveals his abuses of the judicial system. Hilaret comically forms a plot to catch the corrupt Justice Squeezum; he is able to overcome it because Fielding promotes dealing with corruption only through legal means, which Hilaret fails to do when she resorts to relying on falsified evidence. Although Justice Squeezum and his corrupt nature almost overcomes the other characters, the manner in which this happens is done in a farcical way to provoke laughter.Rivero 1989 pp. 84‚Äì86 Themes Although the play deals with political themes, politics is not the play's purpose, nor is a critique of politics. The play has obvious political connections as title refers to the rape case of Colonel Francis Charteris, dubbed \\"Rapemaster General of Great Britain\\". However, the play is more focused on morality and there is no direct correlation between any of the characters and Charteris.Rivero 1989 pp. 77‚Äì79 Of course, the contemporary audiences would have known that there was a connection, as Bertrand Goldgar argues, \\"there can be little doubt that the audiences at the Haymarket in June would have immediately connected Fielding's Rape upon Rape with the Charteris affair.\\"Goldgar 1976 p. 106 However, the use of \\"rape\\" in the play is more than just forced sexual intercourse; it is used to describe all abuses of freedom and the corruption of power.Rivero 1989 p. 85 The title, without needing to actually include Charteris, allows for the play to serve as a critique of abuses of power and immorality. Justice Squeezum represents the flaws of society, while Justice Worthy represents England as it tries to deal with the various problems. The play serves as a way for Fielding to express his own views about society in his comedy. Fielding furthered this end by using Aristophanes as a model, and the theatre became his means to encouraging social change. However, the play is still a comedy, and the social agenda stands besides romantic intrigue and traditional comedic situations. There is an emphasis on legal matters, and the final words deal with crime.Rivero 1989 pp. 79‚Äì80 As such, the theatre serves as a kind of courtroom, and the characters are judged throughout the play with Fielding serving as a sort of prosecutor.Rivero 1989 p. 83 Sources The character of Politick is connected to a tradition of politically involved individuals that frequent coffee-houses. These include the character Upholsterer featured in the Tatler and Beaver the Haberdasher from the Spectator. The type of character also appeared in multiple plays that Fielding would have known, including: Toby Clincher in Sir Harry Wildair (1701) and Postscript in The Generous Husband: or, The Coffee-House Politician (1711). The general idea behind Politick are an incarnation of the news of the day and his discussions involve many events that were contemporaneous with the play. Real newspapers and their reports are mocked throughout.Fielding 2004 pp. 406‚Äì408 Other characters are likewise connected to a traditional type within Restoration literature; Squeezum is related to the corrupt politician Quorum in Charles Coffey's The Beggar's Wedding (1729) or the Justice of the Peace in Coffey's The Female Parson (1730). Other works use the same character type, including Butler's Hudibras, Thomas Baker's The Humour of the Age (1701), Swift's Project for the Advancement of Religion, and the Reformation of Manners (1709), and Christopher Bullock's The Per-Juror (1717). Of course, Fielding's own works, including The Author's Farce, The Old Debauchees, and The Covent- Garden Tragedy includes the character type. However, as Thomas Lockwood points out, \\"These earlier stage justices are precedents more than sources, as the scope and development of the Squeezum character are beyond anything to be found in these other examples.\\"Fielding 2004 pp. 408‚Äì410 Influence Later works, including Arthur Murphy's The Upholster, or What News? (1758) and William Hodson's The Adventures of a Night (1783), borrowed from the play and met with mixed results. The play was also transformed by Bernard Miles into the musical Lock up your Daughters (1959). The show was performed at the Mermaid Theatre on 28 May 1959 and lasted for 330 shows. It was shown in Boston, New Haven, and Toronto in 1960, Melbourne in 1961, again at the Mermaid Theatre in 1962, and later Pasadena and Fort Lauderdale in 1968 and at East Haddam and the West End in 1969. A film version was made in 1969, but the movie has little connection to the original play.Fielding 2004 p. 417 Critical response The original edition did not experience the same draw as Fielding's Tom Thumb. However, none of the other plays at the Little Theatre were able to compete with its success. The revised edition was not a success and made very little. There are few surviving mentions of the play which include Arthur Murphy's comment in the Gray's-Inn Journall (1754) that scenes can be stolen from Rape upon Rape because no one would notice the similarity since the play was no longer performed. In Murphy's 1762 edition of Fielding's Works, he praises the play.Fielding 2004 pp. 415‚Äì418 However, he is the only one to talk about the play until the 19th century. John Genest praised it but adds, \\"the humour is low and [...] not very decent\\".Genest 1832 p. 305 Lawrence also praised aspects of the play but believed that no one could have liked the play because it was \\"too gross and too indelicate for the audiences even of that tolerant age\\".Lawrence 1855 p. 34 E. P. Whipple, in an 1849 review of Roscoe's biography of Fielding, declared that Murphy would have to be drunk to have actually appreciated the play.Fielding 2004 p. 418 During the 20th-century, Dobson found little to praise within the playDobson 1911 p. 18 and Cross followed in suit.Cross 1918 p. 93 F. Homes Dudden characterised the play as \\"a coarse play, modelled on the lines of the Jonsonian 'comedy of humours'. Its chief interest lies in the portrayal of two characters, both rather heavily exaggerated.Dudden 1966 p. 69 ReferencesCitationsBibliography= * Cross, Wilbur. The History of Henry Fielding.

The film is the second of an unfinished trilogy started with Trilogy: The Weeping Meadow in 2004. The last part of the trilogy had the working title The Other Sea. The trilogy was left uncompleted by Angelopoulos' unexpected death in January 2012. Plot In 1999, an American film director of Greek descent named A (Willem Dafoe) receives a phone call from his melancholic daughter at the Cinecitt√† studio. He rushes back to his apartment in Rome, where he finds a letter his mother, Eleni (Ir√®ne Jacob), wrote to his father, Spyros (Michel Piccoli), in 1956. In 1953, Eleni and Jacob (Bruno Ganz), a Jew of German descent, watch the newsreel in Temirtau. Spyros gets there. Spyros and Eleni jump onto a tram, leaving Jacob alone. The tram arrives at the public square in front of the government office, where Stalin's death is announced to the people. That night, immediately after Spyros and Eleni make love on the tram, the two are arrested and taken away separately. In 1956, in Siberia, Eleni puts her three-year-old son on the train bound for Moscow, where Jacob's older sister will take care of him. On New Year's Eve in 1973, Eleni and Jacob cross the border from Hungary to Austria. After celebrating the New Year together, Eleni ends her relationship with Jacob, encouraging him to go on to Israel. In summer 1974, Eleni finally finds Spyros in the suburbs of New York. However, she leaves without saying anything to him after she realized that he is already married to another woman. In winter 1974, Eleni crosses the border from the United States to Canada. There, she and A meet again for the first time in many years. A drives Spyros over to a bar in Ontario, where Eleni works. Spyros enters the bar and makes an offer of marriage to Eleni. The two hug and kiss each other. In 1999, Eleni and Spyros arrive in Berlin. Jacob visits the hotel they are staying at. The three go out in the rain and dance to the gypsy music at the station. There, Eleni feels dizzy. Spyros makes a phone call to A and is informed that their granddaughter has been found. Eleni and Spyros go to the old building where their granddaughter barricades herself along with drug addicts and vagabonds. Eleni enters the building and rescues her granddaughter. They go back to A's apartment in Berlin, and Eleni lies down on the bed in her granddaughter's room. After visiting Eleni, Jacob commits suicide by drowning himself in the Spree river. On New Year's Day in 2000, Eleni dies. Spyros and his granddaughter look out of the window. After a while, the two are seen smiling and running hand in hand under the Brandenburg Gate in the snow.

Reception The Dust of Time received some positive reviews in the Greek press. Peter Brunette of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review, stating that the plot had improbable situations and describing the film as \\"a curious mixture of the brilliant and the absurd.\\" Dan Fainaru of Screen International felt that it is Theodoros Angelopoulos' most affecting and personal film in years. Derek Elley of Variety criticized the film as \\"a tired-looking attempt to say something significant by a 73-year-old auteur who has neither anything significant left to say nor the cinematic smarts to say it with.\\" Vrasidas Karalis found the film to suffer from overplotting, and viewed its \\"depictions of intersecting temporalities\\" as inventive but confusing. In the book Cinema of Theo Angelopoulos, Angelos Koutsourakis wrote that \\"the expository dialogue [...] often comes across as wooden\\" and stated that the film had a \\"bristling recalcitrance\\". Ronald Bergan was more positive, writing in The Guardian that \\"the film sometimes veers from the profound to the portentous, from the sublimely ridiculous to the ridiculously sublime. However, these weaknesses fade beside the strength of the great set pieces [...] and the passion of the narrative.\\" In a press conference for the Greek media, the director was asked about the critics for his film and replied that \\"the directors are not chosen by the critics or by the audience but by the time\\" and that for him all of his films are chapters of the same films, \\"Chapters, as he said, of a big book, about human destiny, about the times passed and about the times coming\\".

Released in hardcover in May 2008, it is the second book in The Last Survivors, following Life as We Knew It and preceding This World We Live In and The Shade of the Moon. Background Pfeffer's novel Life As We Knew It was created after watching the original film Meteor (1979), noting that \\"it got [her] thinking about how the people who have the most to lose if the world comes to an end are kids,\\" and wanted to see how her characters would cope with a situation that was out of their control. The Dead and the Gone occurs at the same time as the first novel, Life As We Knew It, but in New York City. She playfully mentioned that \\"I figure with 300 million people alive in the United States, even if I write about 10 people a book, I can still get another 2,999,998 novels out of that meteor, and that should keep me busy and entertained well past the foreseeable future.\\" http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&id;=40613 The Dead and the Gone uses a third-person narrative, while the previous book, Life As We Knew It, used a first-person narrative in a journal format. Asked about the change in narrative, Pfeffer replied quite simply that in her planning processes, she \\"just could not envision a teenage boy keeping a diary. It's as simple as that,\\" accounting for the change. Plot The Dead and the Gone follows 17-year-old Alex Morales and his sisters, Briana and Julie, in their struggle to survive after an asteroid hits the Moon and knocks it out of orbit, closer to Earth. Taking place in New York, they are plagued with volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and tidal waves, and earthquakes, along with famine caused by food shortages and disease that kill millions of people in the process. Alex is forced to take care of his sisters in the absence of his mother and father and to raid dead bodies for valuables to trade for food. He struggles with his religious faith while trying desperately to survive. Characters Alex Morales: A 17-year-old Puerto Rican boy who has to take care of his two younger sisters after the moon disaster occurs. He blames himself for all of the things happening to his sisters and his supposed inability to help them. He attends a private school on a scholarship, and before the moon disaster worked at a pizza place. Near the end of the book, he gets the flu. Briana Morales (Bri): Alex's devoutly religious 14-year-old sister. She is more used to cooking and cleaning than Alex is, and takes on these household chores. Alex arranges for her to be sent to a convent in the country, where she can receive education and regular meals. She is brought back to New York some time later, having developed asthma due to the volcanic ash polluting the air. After this, Alex won't let her do anything around the house, so it is left up to Julie. Because of her religious beliefs, she has faith that their parents are still alive and will return to the family eventually. Julie Morales: Alex's youngest sister. Julie is 12 years old and turns 13 later in the book. She stays with Alex when Bri leaves, and despite their differences before the book, they become much closer as they struggle to survive. She gets on well with Bri despite their different religious attitudes, and is particularly close to Carlos. Despite Alex initially considering her to be a spoiled brat, she ultimately copes well with the situation they are in. Father Mulrooney: The strict and uptight elderly head of Alex's private school. After Alex initially considered him to be unduly harsh, they become closer over time, with Father Mulrooney helping Alex and Julie escape what is left of the city at the end of the story. Sister Rita: Headmaster of Julie and Bri's school, Holy Angels. Assisted Father Mulrooney help get Alex and Julie out of New York City. Isabella Morales (Mami): Alex, Bri, and Julie's mother. A kind, nurturing, and caring woman who works as a nurse, Isabella is an effectual mother. She was most likely in the subways when the floods hit and is presumed dead. Luis Morales (Papi): Alex's father, who, while strict and overly- uptight, is still loving and nurturing. He was the superintendent of their apartment building, and the family lives in the basement apartment. He was on the coast of Puerto Rico when tides rose and is presumed dead. Kevin Daley: A classmate of Alex's, who has black market connections. He teaches Alex how to \\"body shop\\" (taking the valuable items off of the people who die in the streets), and how to trade those items for food. Harvey: A man with whom Alex trades items, from body shopping and from other apartments, for food. Introduced to him by Kevin Daley. Carlos Morales: Alex's 22-year-old brother, who is in the Marines and deployed to Texas. Chris Flynn: A wealthy boy in Alex's class. He was rivals with Alex before the apocalypse, and offers Alex a favour when he leaves the city. Uncle Jimmy and Aunt Lorraine: Alex's aunt and uncle, who have three young children with another one on the way. They own a bodega, and Uncle Jimmy allows Alex and Julie to pack up some food to take home. They leave New York City to move to Tulsa, and offer to take Bri with them. Father Franco: The priest at Alex's church. He organises for Bri to live at the convent, and provides solace and information throughout the disaster. Tony Loretto and James Flaherty: Alex's schoolmates, who help Alex and Kevin plan a birthday party for Julie and get Bri asthma medication. Reception Publishers Weekly described The Dead and the Gone as \\"riveting\\", and said that \\"once again Pfeffer creates tension not only through her protagonist's day-to- day struggles but also through chilling moral dilemmas: whether to rob the dead, whom to save during a food riot, how long to preserve the hope that his parents might return,\\" adding that \\"[t]he powerful images and wrenching tragedies will haunt readers.\\" John Green of the New York Times said that it \\"transcend[s] [its] premises with terrifyingly well-imagined futures and superb characterization,\\" and that \\"the story‚Äôs climax and resolution feel achingly right.\\" References Category:2008 American novels Category:2008 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:American young adult novels Category:American post-apocalyptic novels Category:Novels set on the Moon Category:Impact event novels Category:Novels set in New York City Category:Debut science fiction novels Category:2008 debut novels ","title":"The Dead and the Gone"},{"id":"21661846","text":"Il Fornaretto di Venezia (US TV title: The Scapegoat, French title Le Petit Boulanger de Venise or, alternatively, Le Proc√®s des Doges ‚Äî as seen on the poster) is a 1963 Italian-French film directed by Duccio Tessari who co-wrote the screenplay with Marcello Fondato, based on a novel by Francesco Dall'Ongaro.

He served as the vice-master of Trinity College, Cambridge from 1914 to 1919, praelector in ancient philosophy from 1875 to 1906 and Regius Professor of Greek (Cambridge) at the University of Cambridge from 1906 to 1921. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1903. He was awarded the Order of Merit on 26 June 1908. From 1882 to 1892 he sat on the Council of the Senate of the University of Cambridge, and was an active member of a number of the university boards. He lived within the walls of Trinity College for over 50 years. Born in Sheffield, he lived mainly in Cambridge, but died in Bournemouth.  Biography  Born on 12 March 1839 in Sheffield, the son of an eminent Sheffield surgeon of the same name and his wife, Frances, third daughter of James Swettenham, of Wood End, near Winksworth. He attended Sheffield Collegiate School and Cheltenham College before entering Trinity College Cambridge in 1858; he graduated BA in 1862 as third Classic. He joined the Cambridge Apostles in 1863. He became a fellow at Trinity College in 1864, and became Assistant Tutor in 1866, Praelector in Ancient Philosophy in 1875 and Vice-Master in 1914. In 1875, he married Margaret, daughter of the Reverend Francis Vansittart Thornton, vicar of South-Hill with Callington, Cornwall. They had two sons and three daughters. Jackson's married life was clouded by the illness of his wife, for many years bedridden and unable to live at Cambridge; his wife spent time in a nursing home. Together with Henry Sidgwick and others he essentially established the Cambridge University's supervisory system by introducing it in the classical side at Trinity. Other disciplines and other colleges soon followed suit. He was interested in university reform including the reform of Triposes (including the Classical Triposes), the admission of women for university education, the abolition of tests, and for the general reform of university and college statutes, and voted for women's degrees. He became Regius professor of Greek at Cambridge University, a post he was appointed to in 1906, following Sir Richard Jebb; after 1879 he became one of the editors of the Journal of Philology until his death. In July 1919, Jackson was honoured on the occasion of his eightieth birthday and his retirement as Vice-Master of Trinity College, with an address presented by the Master and Fellows. Jackson's area of study was Greek philosophy, but he did not publish greatly ‚Äì editing book 5 of the Nicomachean Ethics and writing a series of pieces on Plato's later theory of ideas in the Journal of Philology. His important work was in translating and commenting upon Aristotle's Ethics. His favourite author was William Makepeace Thackeray and, long before his death it was said he had read Thackeray's Henry Esmond forty times apparently. His greater achievement was in his lectures and his ability to train the next generation of classical scholars. His more eminent students included R. K. Gaye, Francis Cornford and R. G. Bury. He was a founder member of Cambridge University Liberal Club in 1886, ultimately serving as its President from 1897 to 1899.http://keynessociety.wordpress.com/about-the-keynes-society/ Henry Jackson died at Bournemouth on 25 September 1921, having been a great reformer, both within his college and the university. His funeral service took place at Trinity College Chapel on 28 September 1921 which many of his colleagues and friends attended. He is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, where his predecessor as Regius Professor of Greek, Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb, a fellow member of the Order of Merit, is also buried.A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. Mark Goldie, pages 62 and 63 (2009) He was a Member of the Cambridge Apostles, the intellectual secret society, from 1863; on 19 February 1898 the Cambridge Apostles had a gala meeting, with a paper delivered by Henry Jackson as one of its oldest members, who had been elected thirty-five years earlier (1863). A full dozen, Desmond MacCarthy, J.M.E. McTaggart, Frederic William Maitland (who had himself been an Apostle for twenty-five years : 1873), Nathaniel Wedd, Bertrand Russell, Robin John Grote Mayor, G.E. Moore, G.M. Trevelyan, Austin Edward Smyth, and both Llewelyn Davies brothers met that night, and Henry Jackson read on ‚ÄòShall we write and re-write and re-write again?‚Äô There is an article on Jackson in Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society suppl. vol. 28 (Cambridge 2005), 87‚Äì110. It is in a special volume entitled The Owl of Minerva: The Cambridge Praelections of 1906. Recognition Jackson received the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901. In Attractive and Nonsensical Classics: Oxford, Cambridge and elsewhere by Christopher Stray , Stray says \\"Then there were the joint dining clubs like the Ad Eundem and the Arcades, set up to link members of the two universities. Finally, some men moved from one place to the other, like the archaeologist Percy Gardner, who went from a Cambridge to an Oxford chair. All these mechanisms facilitated mutual learning ‚Äì as did the railway line. Henry Jackson, who succeeded Richard Jebb as professor of Greek at Cambridge in 1906, belonged to the Ad Eundem club. In 1913 he responded to a comment from a friend that Gilbert Murray was a 'very attractive person' by saying that 'Oxford is very successful in breeding \\"attractive\\" scholars: more so than Cambridge. And this is not surprising. For we dare not talk our shop in a mixed company, and even in a scholars' party we are very conscious of our limitations as specialists'.\\" Henry Jackson declared that he always regard the Ad Eundem 'as one of Henry' [Sidgwick]'s good works', and claimed that it has been very useful as a link between Oxford and Cambridge Universities.Jackson to J. A. Platt, 15 August 1913. R. St. J. Parry, Henry Jackson OM, CUP 1926, 184‚Äì5. Books by Henry Jackson He published a series of articles on \\"Plato's Later Theory of Ideas\\" (Journal of Philology); also About Edwin Drood (1911), The Fifth Book of Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle (1879), and Texts to illustrate a Course of Elementary Lectures on the History of Greek Philosophy from Thales to Aristotle (1901).

Captain Phillip Esposito and First Lieutenant Louis Allen, from a New York Army National Guard unit of the United States 42nd Infantry Division, were mortally wounded in Esposito's office by a Claymore mine and died. Military investigators determined that the mine was deliberately placed in the window and detonated to kill Esposito and Allen. Staff Sergeant Alberto B. Martinez, who was in the officers' unit, was charged with two counts of premeditated murder. In 2006, two years before the trial, Martinez volunteered in a plea bargain to plead guilty to murder in exchange for a life sentence without parole; Lt. Gen. John Vines, commander of the Army‚Äôs 18th Airborne Corps and the convening authority, rejected the deal. In the court martial, Martinez was acquitted on December 4, 2008, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The case was one of only two publicly known alleged fragging incidents among American forces during the Iraq War and the only one to take place in Iraq, in contrast to numerous incidents among United States forces during the Vietnam War of the 1960s and early 70s. In April 2005, Sergeant Hasan Karim Akbar was convicted on charges of premeditated murder and sentenced to death for the first incident, which took place in March 2003 in Kuwait. Attack On the evening of June 7, 2005, Captain Phillip Esposito, 30, and First Lieutenant Louis Allen, 34, were playing the board game Risk in Esposito's office in the Water Palace building on the United States Forward Operating Base (FOB) Danger in Tikrit, Iraq. The officers were from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the 42nd Infantry Division, a New York Army National Guard unit from Troy, New York; it was deployed to Iraq in support of American operations in the Iraq War. Esposito was the company commander and had been stationed in Iraq about six months. Allen was the company's new operations officer; he had arrived in the unit just four days before. At 10 p.m., an M18A1 Claymore mine placed next to the window of Esposito's office exploded, blasting 700 steel ball bearings into the office space and fatally wounding the two officers. Seconds later, several grenades exploded in the vicinity of Esposito's office. The two injured officers were rushed to a hospital at Forward Operating Base Speicher. Both died early June 8, 2005, from serious internal injuries suffered in the first explosion. Victims *Philip Esposito, a project manager for Smith Barney in Manhattan, lived in Suffern, New York with his wife and 18-month-old daughter. He was a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. More than 500 people attended his funeral on June 16, 2005 after his body was returned home. *Louis Allen, a high-school physics and earth sciences teacher in Tuxedo, New York, lived in Milford, Pennsylvania with his wife and four young sons. Focus on Martinez In 2005, Army prosecutors accused Staff Sergeant Alberto B. Martinez of Schaghticoke, New York, (above), of murdering Captain Phillip Esposito and First Lieutenant Louis Allen. An XVIII Airborne Corps court-martial subsequently acquitted Martinez of all charges on December 4th, 2008. Military investigators initially thought that the two officers were killed by an insurgent mortar or rocket attack. When they determined that the blast was deliberately caused by a hand-placed explosive device, they began looking for suspects. Learning that Staff Sergeant Alberto B. Martinez, 37, had made numerous threats against Esposito, and based on their investigation, they arrested and charged him with two counts of premeditated murder. This happened the same week in June that Esposito and Allen were buried in their home towns. From Schaghticoke, New York near Troy, Martinez is married with two children. He had joined the National Guard in 1990 and been assigned to Iraq in 2004. He was serving as the supply sergeant of the unit headed by Esposito and Allen. Esposito and Martinez had come into conflict before arriving in Tikrit in April 2004, as Esposito tried to bring the sergeant in line. Martinez was later described in court \\"as a poorly disciplined and foul- mouthed guardsman who needed a special waiver to qualify for duty.\\" Witnesses testified that Martinez \\"could not account for hundreds of thousands of dollars in missing equipment.\\" Esposito eventually restricted Martinez from going into the supply area without an escort. Martinez feared Esposito would get him kicked out of the Guard, costing him $2,859 in monthly pay. Witnesses later testified that Martinez had openly threatened to kill Esposito. The captain had already disciplined Martinez for poor job performance; he had also initiated proceedings that might have resulted in Martinez being discharged from the military or removed from his full-time Guard position. Esposito was considered the target of the attack, as Allen had arrived in the unit in Tikrit only days before. Witnesses placed Martinez in the vicinity of the Water Palace shortly after the explosion. Proceeding to trial In October and November 2005, the military held an Article 32 hearing, similar to a grand jury hearing, in Kuwait rather than Tikrit, in order to allow the wives of Martinez, Esposito and Allen to attend; all three did. In addition, the Army arranged for transmission of an audio link of the two-day proceedings to West Point to allow other family members in the area to follow them. Nine witnesses testified. Colonel Patrick Reinert recommended a general court-martial for Martinez on murder charges based on the evidence presented. In early 2006 Martinez learned of additional evidence against him. This included testimony from a soldier who said she had given Martinez Claymore mines and grenades shortly before the killings. On April 3, 2006, he volunteered to plead guilty to murder in exchange for a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 10 years. But, Lieutenant General John Vines, commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps and convening authority over the legal proceedings, rejected the plea agreement. Vines sent the case to court-martial under two counts of premeditated murder, Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In April 2007 the defense asked for more time to prepare its case and presented the judge with four motions. In addition to the charges of premeditated murder, at the time Martinez was charged with one count each of wrongful possession of a privately owned firearm, unexploded ordnance, and alcohol. The other charge against him was for wrongfully giving government property, in this case printers and copiers, to an Iraqi national. One of the defense motions was to sever the murder charges from the others. The case was scheduled to go to trial in August 2007.Staff, \\"Defense for alleged fragger asks for more time\\" , Military Times, 18 April 2007, accessed 15 March 2013 In August 2008, the defense asked the judge to dismiss the murder charges, because of what they alleged was the prosecutor trying to influence a witness who could help the defense. The judge refused the request. The court-martial was held at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, beginning in October 2008, with Colonel Stephen Henley sitting as the trial judge. During the trial, Sergeant Sandra Pelton, a 42nd Division cook, testified for the prosecution that Martinez twice mentioned fragging when he came through her dining facility a few days before the explosion. On one occasion when Pelton asked Martinez how he was doing, he made a noise simulating an explosion and said, \\"Frag him, frag. I mean it.\\" Approximately 20 other soldiers and officers testified that they had heard Martinez threaten or insult Esposito. Martinez's defense team countered that the Army's evidence against Martinez was circumstantial, and prosecution witnesses' testimonies were inconsistent. The defense team also presented evidence that Martinez was not the only soldier in the unit with a grudge against Esposito. After two days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Martinez on December 4, 2008. In the military, a two-thirds vote by the jury is needed for conviction. The prosecutor in the case speculated that some jurors' known opposition to the death penalty may have influenced their votes for acquittal. Acquittal and honorable discharge Soon after his acquittal, Martinez received an honorable discharge from the National Guard. Publicly, Martinez \\"proclaimed his innocence and a sense of vindication.\\" Military prosecutors repeated their belief in Martinez's guilt. In 2009, a report in The New York Times revealed that Martinez had offered in 2006 to plead guilty to 2nd-degree murder in an attempted plea bargain that was ultimately rejected by the government. Martinez's guilty plea offer was signed by his two Army defense lawyers who were permitted by Army regulations to sign the plea offer only if they believed at the time that Martinez committed the crime. Subsequent debate was twofold: one question arose over whether the government's pursuit of the death penalty may lead defendants to plead to crimes they have not committed in order to avoid death as a punishment. Another question focused on the alleged inflexibility of the military's punishment scheme, as the government had apparently rejected Martinez's 2006 plea on the grounds that Martinez would have been eligible for parole within 10 years if sentenced to life, even after pleading guilty to 2nd-degree murder in the slaying of the two officers.  Post-Acquittal  In 2009, Siobhan Esposito opposed the Obama administration's nomination of Major General Joseph Taluto as director of the Army National Guard. Taluto served as the general in charge of her husband's National Guard unit. Esposito argued that Taluto was negligent when leaders under his command failed to hold Martinez to account for his many threats against her husband. After Esposito complained to the Senate Armed Services Committee about Taluto, he withdrew his nomination. Esposito has also argued that military leaders should strictly enforce regulations that prohibit threats against superiors and encourage soldiers to report violations of military discipline.David Zucchino, \\"Widows pursue justice in soldiers' slayings\\", Los Angeles Times, 8 April 2010, 15 March 2013 In 2009, Barbara Allen initiated an effort to compel the Army to award the Purple Heart to her husband for his slaying. Allen unsuccessfully petitioned the Military Awards Board and the Secretary of the Army for a hearing on the matter. As of January 2017, the Army has denied her request, citing the lack of a \\"nexus to enemy action\\" that would merit an awarding of the medal. Allen also wrote a memoir about her experiences in the face of her husband's death, Martinez's court-martial, and his acquittal. On January 22, 2017, Alberto Martinez died in Florida of unspecified causes. The case was one of only two publicly known instances of U.S. Army enlisted soldiers charged with intentionally killing superior officers during the Iraq war, and the only one to occur in Iraq. To date, the Army has not publicly identified or charged any other individual in Esposito and Allen's slaying.

The lyricist and composer were both extremely popular recording artists. Gene Austin estimated he sold 80 million records, and Nathaniel Shilkret's son estimated his father sold 50 million records. Joel Whitburn lists recordings by Austin, Bing Crosby, Ted Lewis, and Shilkret (see list of recordings below) as being \\"charted\\" at Numbers 10, 12, 3 and 10, respectively. There are no reliable sales figures that can be used to verify or dispute any of the estimates above. Use in film and live performances The composition was notably used as a substitute for Ol' Man River in the finale of the part-talkie 1929 film version of Edna Ferber's novel Show Boat. It was performed onscreen by Stepin Fetchit as the deckhand Joe. Fetchit's singing voice was supplied by bass-baritone Jules Bledsoe, who had played Joe in the original stage version of the musical. The Shilkret autobiography contains a brief account of the motivation for using the song in the film. The song was also used in the motion pictures Submarine Command (1951), Cha-Cha- Cha Boom! (1956) (performed by the Mary Kaye Trio), California Split (1974), Wild Man Blues (1997) and Crazy (2007) (performed by Madeleine Peyroux). It was featured on two soundies, one with the Lucky Millinder orchestra, with vocal by Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and another with the Al Donahue Orchestra. Both soundies could be viewed on YouTube at the time of this writing. It was used in the television series The Andy Griffith Show (Rafe Hollister Sings, Episode 83 - The Hollister rendition was viewable on YouTube at the time of this writing), Peter Gunn (The Dummy), Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. (Gomer Says \`Hey', Episode 97), Matlock (Class), and The Odd Couple (Rent Strike, Episode 107). \\"Lonesome Road\\" was included in the television productions Vintage Sinatra (PBS, 2003), Now (with David Brancaccio, 2005), and Smuckers Presents Kurt Browning's Gotta Skate (2006), and in the Radio City Music Hall production Frank Sinatra: His Voice, His World, His Way (2004). Recordings (Mechanicals) It was initially recorded September 16, 1927, by Austin, accompanied by Shilkret directing the Victor Orchestra. There have been over two hundred recordings of \\"Lonesome Road,\\" including versions by Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby (recorded December 12, 1938), Ted Lewis, Stevie Wonder, Sam Cooke, Ace Cannon, Chris Connor and Dick Dale. Esther & Abi Ofarim recorded the song in 1967 for their album 2 In 3. It was issued as a single B-side single to \\"Cinderella Rockefella\\" on Philips Records.http://www.esther-ofarim.de/Disco.htm Ella Fitzgerald and Andy Williams performed a duet on Andy's TV show of January 1, 1967. Future ABBA member Anni-Frid Lyngstad recorded a Swedish version titled ‚ÄúN√§r Du Blir Min‚Äù which was released as a B-side to 1968 single ‚ÄúMycket K√§r‚Äù. Bob Dylan borrowed the melody and a few lines for his song \\"Sugar Baby\\", on his 2001 album \\"Love & Theft\\". Crooked Still covered the song on their 2004 album Hop High.  Genres  \\"Lonesome Road\\" has been recorded in the jazz, gospel, blues, big band and dance music genres. There is a hint of humor in the Louis Armstrong and Hoyt Axton recordings, and the Dean Elliot recording is notable for its unusual sound effects, provided by Phil Kaye. The Keith Textor album was made by RCA to demonstrate sound effects using stereo; the \\"Lonesome Road\\" track demonstrates someone snapping their fingers and whistling, going from left to right and then back. The Wilbur Bradley recording contains a short passage identifiable as \\"Lonesome Road\\" at the beginning, with the remainder of the recording being a drum solo by Bradley's co-leader Ray McKinley. The Ivory and Gold recording features a flute solo. In some jazz recordings, such as the one by Morris Grants, which credits Austin‚ÄîShilkret, the jazz improvisation is so dominant that the relation to the Austin‚ÄîShilkret Lonesome Road, if any, is obscure. The Montenegro recording is licensed, but here also the relation to the Austin‚ÄîShilkret song is obscure. Many of the recordings are usable for dancing. The Sid Phillips recording is excellent for (International Style) foxtrot, and the Madeleine Peyroux recording is also suitable for foxtrot. The recording by The Fashions is a quickstep. The Hoyt Axton recording is a good jive. Quite a few of the recordings are usable for East Coast Swing, and the Floyd Cramer recording is suitable for West Coast Swing. The twist could be danced to the recordings by Lyndstadt and the Collins Kids. The Chantays' recording has a cha cha beat.

Common names include bollygum, bolly wood and brown beech. The habitat of the bollygum is rainforest of most types, except the dryer forms. Taxonomy Litsea reticulata was first described by Meisner in 1864 as Tetranthera reticulata, before being given its current name by von Mueller in 1882. Common names include bolly gum, bolly beech, brown beech, brown bolly beech, sycamore, brown Bollywood, soft bollygum, and brown bollygum.  Description  Litsea reticulata is a medium to large size tree, occasionally reaching 40 metres in height and a 150 cm in trunk diameter. The bark is a grey, brown and scaly, with numerous depressions caused by the shedding of round scales of bark, colloquially known as \\"bollies\\". Exposed bark is a paler colour, giving the trunk a patchy appearance. Litsea reticulata are slightly buttressed or flanged at the base. = Leaves, flowers and fruit = The leaves are alternate, not toothed. 5 to 10 cm long, blunt or slightly pointed, the leaves are veiny underneath. Leaf stalks are 5 to 12 mm long. Litsea reticulata is dioecious (male and female flowers are on separate trees). Flowers cream or green with pink. Flowering period is May to July. The fruit matures from November to April, being a purple/black 14 mm long drupe, in a green cup shaped receptacle, with a single seed, 11 mm long. Seed germination can be slow. (other publication details, included in citation) However, at other times, 60% germination result can be achieved within a month of sowing. The flesh should be removed from the fruit before sowing the seeds. Fruit are eaten by many rainforest birds, including the wompoo fruit dove, catbird, topknot pigeon and white-headed pigeon.

It involves a rookie cop (Michael Moriarty) in the New York City Police Department who is assigned a special missing person case, which in fact is meant to be a wild-goose chase to back up an undercover female police officer's role as the girlfriend of a drug dealer. The film was directed by Milton Katselas and features a musical score by Elmer Bernstein. The script is by two Oscar-winning screenwriters, Abby Mann (Judgment at Nuremberg) and Ernest Tidyman (The French Connection). It marked Richard Gere's film debut. Plot Beauregard \\"Bo\\" Lockley (Michael Moriarty), long-haired and thoughtful, is a new type of undercover detective in the New York Police Department. He is assigned to find a missing young woman (Susan Blakely), but is not told she is actually an undercover officer, whose latest assignment is to get close to a heroin dealer, Thomas 'Stick' Henderson (Tony King), upon whom the department has long been wanting to get the goods. Lockley finds her living with the dealer in the Times Square area of New York City. Frustrated by his presence, as it jeopardizes her assignment, she arranges to meet with Lockley the following morning. But when she misses the appointment he goes to where she and Henderson are living, and in the confused shoot-out that follows Lockley accidentally shoots her dead. Lockley chases Henderson through the streets and into the Saks Fifth Avenue department store, and the two end up trapped in an elevator between floors, holding guns on each other. The two men bond during the fruitless negotiations that follow, and after some time agree to try to get away through the trapdoor in the ceiling of the elevator. However the entire area is surrounded by heavily armed police, who shoot Henderson dead. Lockley and the policewoman‚Äôs superior officers, determined to save their careers, scramble to come up with a story that would be minimally embarrassing to the department. They claim that Lockley, the woman and the dealer were involved in a lovers‚Äô triangle and that Lockley shot her out of jealousy.

It is an expanded and reworked version of one of his earlier plays, Tom Thumb, and tells the story of a character who is small in stature and status, yet is granted the hand of a princess in marriage; the infuriated queen and another member of the court subsequently attempt to destroy the marriage. In adapting his earlier work Fielding incorporated significant plot changes; he also made the play more focused, and unified the type of satire by narrowing its critique of the abuses of language. Additionally, in a reaction to the view that Tom Thumb was a burlesque, Fielding replaced some of the humour in favour of biting satire. The play was first performed at the Haymarket Theatre on 24 March 1731, with the companion piece The Letter Writers. Critics enjoyed the play, but pointed out that it was originally designed as a companion piece to The Author's Farce. Background The Tragedy of Tragedies was an expanded and rewritten version of Tom Thumb. Fielding altered the play because although audiences enjoyed the play they did not notice the satire directed at the problems of contemporary theatre; the rewrite was intended to make the satire more obvious. The play was first performed on 24 March 1731 at the Haymarket Theatre in London, with the companion piece The Letter Writers. Its printed edition was \\"edited\\" and \\"commented\\" on by Fielding's pseudonym H. Scriblerus Secundus, who pretends not to be the original author.Rivero 1989 pp. 70‚Äì73 It contains a frontispiece by Hogarth, which serves as the earliest proof of a relationship between Fielding and Hogarth.Dudden 1966 p. 60 The printed edition was available on opening night and the notes included with the printed edition served as a way to explain the play. It was printed by James Roberts alongside of an edition of The Letter-Writers. The printed version of The Tragedy of Tragedies created two versions of the play, one that was acted and another that was to be read, and both contained humour catered to each.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 107 Fielding believed modern tragedies to be superior to the Classic Greek tragedies because the Classics could only invoke pity and fear in the audience, while modern tragedies were able to leave the audience laughing at the ridiculous situations onstage. Fielding referred to these modern works as \\"laughing tragedies\\" and claimed that the only difference between his work and the modern tragedies was that his work was intentional in its laughter.Lewis 1987 p. 113 Fielding's play was later adapted into The Opera of Operas; or Tom Thumb the Great by playwrights Eliza Haywood and William Hatchett. It ran 13 nights at the Little Theatre starting 31 May 1733 and was discontinued because of the hot weather. It was later continued and had many shows during the seasons following.Ingrassia 1998 pp. 106‚Äì107 The Tragedy of Tragedies turned out to be one of Fielding's most enduring plays, with interesting later revivals. The novelist Frances Burney played Huncamunca in private productions of 1777, there was a private production done by the family of Jane Austen at Steventon in 1788, and professor William Kurtz Wimsatt Jr. played the giantess Glumdalca at a Yale University production in 1953.Keymer (2007) pp. 26‚Äì27 Cast Cast according to the original printed billing:Fielding 2004 pp. 547‚Äì548 * King Arthur ‚Äì \\"A passionate sort of King, Husband to Queen Dollallolla, of whom he stands a little in Fear; Father to Huncamunca, of whom he is very fond; and in Love with Glumdalca\\", played by Mr. Mullart * Tom Thumb the Great ‚Äì \\"A little Hero with a great Soul, something violent in his Temper, which is a little abated by his Love for Huncamunca\\", played by Young Verhuyck * Ghost of Gaffar Thumb ‚Äì \\"A whimsical sort of Ghost\\", played by Mr. Lacy * Lord Grizzle ‚Äì \\"Extremely zealous for the Liberty of the Subject, very cholerick in his Temper, and in Love with Huncaumunca\\", played by Mr. Jones * Merlin ‚Äì \\"A Conjurer, and in some sort Father to Tom Thumb\\", played by Mr. Hallam * Noodle and Doodle ‚Äì \\"Courtiers in Place, and consequently of that Part that is uppermost\\", Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Wathan * Foodle ‚Äì \\"A Courtier that is out of Place, and consequently of that Part that is undermost\\", played by Mr. Ayres * Bailiff and Follower ‚Äì \\"Of the Party of the Plaintiff\\", played by Mr. Peterson and Mr. Hicks * Parson ‚Äì \\"Of the Side of the Church\\", played by Mr. Watson * Queen Dollallolla ‚Äì \\"Wife to King Arthur, and Mother to Huncaumunca, a Woman entirely faultless, saving that she is little given to Drink; a little too much a Virago towards her Husband, and in Love with Tom Thumb\\", played by Mrs. Mullart * The Princess Huncamunca ‚Äì \\"Daughter to their Majesties King Arthur and Queen Dollallolla, of a very sweet, gentle, and amorous Disposition, equally in Love with Lord Grizzle and Tom Thumb, and desirous to be married to them both\\", played by Mrs. Jones * Glumdalca ‚Äì \\"of the Giants, a Captive Queen, belov'd by the King, but in Love with Tom Thumb\\", played by Mrs. Dove * Cleora and Mustacha ‚Äì \\"Maids of Honour, in Love with Noodle. Doodle.\\" unlisted * Other characters include Courtiers, Guards, Rebels, Drums, Trumpets, Thunder and Lightning Plot There is little difference between the general plot outline of Tom Thumb and The Tragedy of Tragedies, but Fielding does make significant changes. He completely removed a scene in which two doctors discuss Tom Thumb's death, and in doing so unified the type of satire that he was working on. He narrowed his critique to abuses of language produced only by individuals subconsciously, and not by frauds like the doctors. As for the rest of the play, Fielding expanded scenes, added characters, and turned the work into a three-act play. Merlin is added to the plot to prophesize Tom's end. In addition, Grizzle becomes Tom's rival for Huncamunca's heart, and a giantess named Glumdalca is added as a second love interest for both King Arthur and Tom. As the play progresses, Tom is not killed by Grizzle, but instead defeats him. However, Tom is killed by a giant, murderous cow offstage, the news of which prompts a killing spree, leaving seven dead bodies littered on stage and the King alone, left to boast that he is the last to fall, right before stabbing himself. The ghost of Tom in Tom Thumb is replaced by the ghost of Gaffar Thumb, Tom's father.Rivero 1989 pp. 69‚Äì71 Variorum Fielding gives special emphasis to the printed version of The Tragedy of Tragedies by including notes and making it his only printed play that originally includes a frontispiece. The variorum, or notes, to the printed version of the play pointed out many of the parodies, allusions, and other references within The Tragedy of Tragedies. However, the notes themselves serve as a parody for serious uses of the notes and mock the idea of critically interpreting plays. By calling himself Scriblerus Secundus, Fielding connects The Tragedy of Tragedies with the works of the Scriblerus Club. These works also contain parodies of critics and scholars who attempt to elucidate literature.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 107‚Äì8 As such, the play is one of Fielding's Scriblerian plays, and the commentary in the print edition adds another level of satire that originates in the Scriblerus model of Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, et al. H. Scriblerus Secundus prefaces the play with claims that Scriblerus spent ten years working on an edition and that the play comes from the Elizabethan time period and may or may not have been the work of Shakespeare. Additionally, Scriblerus abuses classical sources through mistranslations and misreadings, botches contemporary and traditional critical theory, and is a satirical representation of criticism in general in the tradition of A Tale of a Tub and The Dunciad Variorum.Rivero 1989 pp. 74‚Äì75 Regardless of the humorous elements, the notes do reveal Fielding's vast classical education.Paulson 2000 p. 54 Fielding's theatrical output of 1730‚Äì1 shows that the assumption of the Scriblerian persona may have had an opportunist character. Though Fielding was happy to share in some of the fame and power of Pope and Swift at their peak, and to borrow some of their themes and techniques, he never agreed wholeheartedly with their cultural or political aims. In his poetry of the period Fielding distanced himself from the Toryism and misanthropy of Pope, and it has been suggested that the surface affiliation of The Tragedy of Tragedies with the writing of the Scriblerus Club masks real antipathy. However, Fielding's use of the Scriblerus name doesn't seem to have been resented by its creators. Swift reportedly praised Fielding as a wit, saying that he had laughed only twice in his life, the second instance being the Circumstance of Tom Thumb's killing the Ghost in the quick accumulation of corpses that closes the play. Pope may have echoed Fielding in the expanded four-book Dunciad of 1743 which suggests memories of Fielding's The Author's Farce in some of the methods it uses to satirise the garish culture of the time.Keymer (2007) p. 28 Themes Hogarth's frontispiece to The Tragedy of Tragedies The previous version, according to Fielding, was criticised as \\"a Burlesque on the loftiest Parts of Tragedy, and designed to banish what we generally call Fine Things, from the Stage.\\"Hillhouse 1918 p. 42 This idea is developed by the focus of the tragedy being on a low-class citizen of the kingdom, even smaller in stature than a regular commoner. Tragedies normally deal with royalty and high-class families, so the focus on little Tom Thumb establishes the satirical nature from the beginning. In addition, the over the top nature of the plot, the intricacies of the characters' relationships, and the littering of bodies at the end of the play all serve to further mock and burlesque eighteenth century tragedies. The burlesque aspects posed a problem for Fielding, and people saw his show more for pleasure than for its biting satire. In altering his ending to having the ghost of Tom's father die instead of Tom's ghost, Fielding sought to remove part of the elements that provoked humour to bolster the satiric purpose of the play.Rivero 1989 p. 72 Fielding rewrites many pieces of dialogue that originate in Tom Thumb, such as condensing Tom's description of the giants to Arthur. This condensing serves as Tom's rejection of the linguistic flourishes found within King Arthur's court that harm the English language as a whole. In both versions, the English language is abused by removing meaning or adding fake words to the dialogue to mimic and mock the dialogues of Colley Cibber's plays. The mocking and playing with language continues throughout; near the end of the play Arthur attacks similes in general:Rivero 1989 pp. 63‚Äì66 :Curst be the Man who first a Simile made! :Curst, ev'ry Bard who writes! ‚Äì So have I seen :Those whose Comparisons are just and true, :And those who liken things not like at all.Hillhouse 1918 p. 87 Fielding's attacks on faulty language are not limited to internal events; he also pokes fun at Lewis Theobald. In particular, Fielding mocks Theobald's tragedy The Persian Princess and his notes on Shakespeare.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 110 Besides critiquing various theatrical traditions, there are gender implications in the dispute between King Arthur and his wife, Queen Dollallolla over which of the females should have Tom as her own. There are possible parallels between King Arthur and King George, and Queen Dollallolla and Queen Caroline, especially given the popular belief that Caroline influenced George's decision making. The gender roles were further complicated and reversed by the masculine Tom Thumb being portrayed by a female during many of the shows. This reversal allows Fielding to critique the traditional understanding of a hero within tragedy and gender roles in general. Hogarth's frontispiece reinforces what Fielding is attempting within The Tragedy of Tragedies by having the hero, Tom Thumb, unable to act as the two females take the dominant role and fight amongst themselves. Ultimately, gender was a way to comment on economics, literature, politics, and society as a whole along with reinforcing the mock-heroic nature of the play.Campbell 1995 pp. 19‚Äì22 Critical response The Daily Post stated in April 1731 that there was a high demand to see the play. Notable individuals who attended the play, according to the 3 May Daily Post, included Princess Amelia and Princess Caroline. Such attendance and popularity among members of the royal court suggest that Fielding was not using the play to subtly criticise them.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 108‚Äì109 F. Homes Dudden argues that \\"As a burlesque of the heroics of Dryden and his school, The Tragedy of Tragedies is a singularly systematic, as well as brilliantly clever, performance.\\"Dudden 1966 pp. 63‚Äì64 The Battestins believe that \\"'The Tragedy of Tragedies ‚Äì although circumstances prevented a run as prolonged as that of Tom Thumb a year earlier ‚Äì was just as successful as its shorter, less elegant predecessor.\\"Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 107 Albert J. Rivero opposes the critical focus on the Tragedy of Tragedies instead of its predecessor, Tom Thumb, because this oversight ignores how the play originated as a companion piece to The Author's Farce.Rivero 1989 pp. 53‚Äì54 NotesReferences   * * Category:Plays by Henry Fielding Category:Comedy plays Category:1731 plays Category:Arthurian theatre Category:Works based on Tom Thumb Category:Plays based on fairy tales ","title":"The Tragedy of Tragedies"},{"id":"21662243","text":"Polvadera (La Polvadera de San Lorenzo) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Socorro County in central New Mexico, USA.

It is about two merchants who strive to keep their wives faithful. Their efforts are unsuccessful, however, until they catch the man who their wives are cheating with. The play, a farce dealing with sex and adultery, was a failure. While Fielding avoided the traditional cliches of the genre, he lost the moral purpose. Critics disagree over the quality of the play, but most agree that the missing moral purpose is the key failure of the play. Background The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home, a three-act farcical play, was first mentioned in the 12 February 1731 Daily Post, which announced that the play would start in March. It first ran on 24 March 1731,Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 106 and it ran for four nights as a companion piece with The Tragedy of Tragedies.Hume 1988 p. 91 It failed as a play,Pagliaro 1998 p. 79 and The Welsh Opera replaced The Letter Writers as the companion piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies on 22 April 1731.Rivero 1989 p. 88 It was advertised for print in the 23 March Daily Post and first printed 24 March for opening night.Cross 1918 p. 292 It was printed by James Roberts with John Watts, even though only Roberts's name appeared on any of the notices, on the same day as The Tragedy of Tragedies. There is a difference in quality between the printed version of The Letter- Writers and other plays, including The Tragedy of Tragedies. The play was printed with less care and includes many mistakes in the text along with other errors.Fielding II 2004 p. 618 Cast Cast list according to the original printed billing:Fielding II 2004 p. 625 * Mr Wisdom ‚Äì played by Mr. Jones * Mrs Wisdom ‚Äì played by Mrs. Lacy * Mr Softly ‚Äì played by Mr. Hallam * Mrs Softly ‚Äì played by Mrs. Mullart * Rakel ‚Äì officer, played by Mr. Lacy * Risque ‚Äì Rakel's servant, played by Mr. Reynolds * Commons ‚Äì friend of Rakel, played by Mr. Mullart * John ‚Äì played by Mr. Wathan * Sneaksby ‚Äì played by Mr. Davenport * Betty ‚Äì played by Mrs. Stokes * Other characters include Constable, Whores, Fidlers, Servants, and others Plot The play revolves around two old merchants named Mr Wisdom and Mr Softly. Each has a young wife and the two men are afraid that their wives will run off with other men. They determine to send a threatening letter to the other's wife to scare them into staying. The letters do not work, and Mrs Softly spends her time pursuing men about town while Mrs Wisdom stays at home with Rakel, an officer. While with Rakel, Mrs Wisdom is almost caught by Mr Wisdom but she is able to sneak him into a closet. Mrs Softly does not have a closet, and she is caught with Rakel by her husband. After great lengths, she is able to convince him that she was not intimate with Rakel; Rakel pretends to be a criminal and Risque helps reinforce the lie. However, she is later discovered with Rakel by Mrs Wisdom after Commons, a friend of Rakel's, comes in drunk and reveals where Rakel was hiding.Hume 1988 pp. 91‚Äì93 Themes The theme of the play is dealing with sex and adultery. However, Fielding ignores many traditional cliches that are part of the sex-comedy farce, which causes him to lose out on emphasising any moral purpose. Instead, Fielding avoids morality and the play instead forgives characters, such as Risque, who don't seem to deserve forgiveness through the play.Hume 1988 pp. 92‚Äì93 In this play, along with The Temple Beau, Rape Upon Rape, and The Grub-Street Opera, Fielding relies on letters to further the plot.Pagliaro 1998 p. 80 Other connections between The Letter Writers and other works by Fielding include Fielding's reliance on the events of his day, public or personal, and his ability to take plain events and find humour within them. In the play, the use of writing letters to intimidate people occurred frequently during the early 1730s. However, the play is different from his other works because it is truly \\"Farce\\" whereas many of his other works are more ballad opera than farce. In terms of characters, Mrs Softly is, according to Ronald Paulson, \\"the first of the vocal and central young women who emerge from Fielding's Moliere plays\\" and serves as the focus for the play.Paulson 2000 p. 60 Sources The idea of using letters to extort money became well known after George Packer, a shipbuilder, was threatened during September 1730. When he did not comply, his house was destroyed by arson on 4 October 1730. His story became well known after reported in various newspapers and others started to copy the extortion attempt. Newspapers began to report on various attempts at extortion and London was filled with general concern over the letters.Fielding II 2004 pp. 610‚Äì611 It is possible that Fielding drew inspiration from a threatening letter sent to Lady Diana Fielding, his second cousin. The letter was dated 29 October 1730, and was just one of many sent to rich people during the early 1730s to intimidate the rich and extort money. There is also a connection between the way The Letter Writers depicts cuckolding with Edward Ravenscroft's The London Cuckolds (1681), although Ravenscroft relied on three couples instead of Fielding's two.Paulson 2000 p. 59 Critical response There are no contemporary accounts of the play besides it being a failure. According to Thomas Lockwood, removing The Letter- Writers from the billing \\"was a forced decision, made necessary because the afterpiece was dragging down the programme‚Äînot an easy accomplishment, where the programme was headed by The Tragedy of Tragedies\\"Fielding II 2004 p. 616 Allardy Nicolls believes that, in regards to The Letter-Writers, \\"Of all eighteenth century farces, Fielding's is perhaps the best\\".Nicoll 1952 p. 215 Robert Hume disagrees with Nicoll's assessment and instead believes that the play's \\"gimmick is a good one\\" but it \\"is ineptly handled\\". F. Homes Dudden notes how The Letter Writers is truly a farce unlike Fielding's other works, but he points out that the play \\"was too conventional to excite much interest.\\"Dudden 1963 pp. 75‚Äì76 The Battesins believe that \\"Slight as it is and unsuccessful, The Letter-Writers is worth noting for the clarity with which it exemplifies certain characteristics of Fielding's work as a comic author.\\" Harold Pagliaro believes that \\"Despite the happy idea of the husbands' letters and the possibilities they generate, the play misses as farce or burlesque, because the outrageous behaviour we have been promised, at least implicitly, never comes to pass. A certain audacity is wanting.\\"Pagliaro 1998 pp. 78‚Äì79 NotesReferences * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe. Henry Fielding: a Life. London: Routledge, 1993. * Fielding, Henry.

First performed on 22 April 1731 in Haymarket, the play replaced The Letter Writers and became the companion piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies. It was also later expanded into The Grub-Street Opera. The play's purported author is Scriblerus Secundus who is also a character in the play. This play is about Secundus' role in writing two (Fielding) plays: The Tragedy of Tragedies and The Welsh Opera. The play served as a tribute to Scriblerians (satirists and members of the informal Scriblerus Club), as such it allowed Fielding to satirise politics. As a political allegory that satirised the government of the time, the play was subject to attacks and a ban. Critics agree that the play was bold in both its writing and its message. Background The first mention of The Welsh Opera in production comes from a Daily Post announcement on 6 April 1731 that the play would be postponed. It first ran on 22 April 1731 with three shows following in April and another in May.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 112‚Äì113 These performances were in the position of companion piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies as a replacement for The Letter Writers in that position. It later ran five times with The Fall of Mortimer during the summer and four times on its own before it was expanded into The Grub-Street Opera.Rivero 1989 p. 88 The expansion was put in place to capitalise on the concept that was deemed popular by the public.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 113 The expanded version of the play, The Grub-Street Opera, was not put on for an audience, which provoked E. Rayner to print The Welsh Opera without Fielding's consent. On 26 June 1731, the Daily Journal announced that E. Rayner and H. Cook published an edition of The Welsh Opera, which was followed by an announcement in the 28 June 1731 Daily Post: > Wheras one Rayner hath publish'd a strange Medley of Nonsense, under the > Title of the Welch Opera, said to be written by the Author of the Tragedy of > Tragedies; and also hath impudently affirm'd that this was a great Part of > the Grub-Street Opera, which he attempts to insinuate was stopt by the > Authority: This is to assure the Town, that what he hath publish'd is a very > incorrect and spurious Edition of the Welch Opera, a very small Part of > which was originally written by the said Author; and that it contains scarce > any thing of the Grub-street Opera, excepting the Names of some of the > Characters and a few of the Songs: This later Piece hath in it above fifty > entire new Songs; and is so far from having been stopt by Authority (for > which there could be no manner of Reason) that it is only postponed to a > proper Time, when it is not doubted but the Town will be convinced how > little that Performance agrees with the intolerable and scandalous Nonsense > of this notorious Paper Pyrate.Hume 1988 qtd. p. 97 Cast * Scriblerus Secundus * Madam Apshinken Plot The play introduces Scriblerus Secundus as a character and no longer simply a commentary to the print editions of Fielding's plays. In a speech, he mentions his role in working on The Tragedy of Tragedies and mentions that he would serve as an editor and commentary to The Welsh Opera within the play itself. However, Scriblerus storms off stage after he is informed that one of his actresses requires a drink before performing in The Welsh Opera that evening.Rivero 1989 pp. 94‚Äì95 The story of the play revolves around a country household and various disputes between the members of the family and the staff.Paulson 2000 p. 52 Themes The Welsh Opera was a tribute to the Scriblerians, especially to John Gay and to his most famous work The Beggar's Opera. This served as a means to put forth a general political view and deal with politics in a more critical way unlike any of Fielding's previous plays. The play is a political allegory that satirises Robert Walpole's government and the British monarchy.Rivero 1989 pp. 91‚Äì92 Fielding also used Gay's technique of swapping London for a pastoral environment. Within the play, a country household represents England and the people represent various leaders and political figures. Fielding also adds many praises of the pastoral life along with favourably portraying roast beef and tobacco while mocking anything foreign. The play was attacked for its political implications, which later resulted in a ban on the play and its sequel from being performed.Cleary 1984 p. 46 However, Fielding does not favour any political party; instead, he attacks both parties while recognising their importance to the nation as a whole. His attacks are personal, especially in alluding to rumours that the Prince of Wales was impotent.Loftis 1963 p. 105 The play did run with The Fall of Mortimer, which made fun of Walpole. The revisions to the play form The Grub- Street Opera.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 117 Sources Part of satire originates from the events surrounding the feud between Walpole and William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath that gained intensity during the creation of the Treaty of Seville and during the Civil List debate. Later in January 1731, Sir William Yonge, 4th Baronet produced Sedition and Defamation Display'd, a pamphlet that mocked Pulteney and defended Yonge's friend, Walpole. Pulteney, in return, dueled with John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, another Walpole friend, after mistaking that it was Hervey who wrote Sedition and Defamation Display'd. Although no one was hurt, the fighting continued in the form of pamphlet attacks until 1 July 1731 when King George II removed Pulteney from the Privy Council. Many works began to satirise elements of the battle between Pulteney and Walpole, including the poems The Devil Knows What and The Compromise (March 1731); these poems depict both Pulteney and Walpole as equivalent complicit in the unfolding events, which is later picked up by Fielding.Fielding 2004 II pp. 1‚Äì4 Response The contemporary view of The Welsh Opera was split: the common people enjoyed the show, but the members of the government did not. However, there was no prohibition of the play by the government. This, according to F. Homes Dudden, encouraged Fielding to expand the play into The Grub-Street Opera.Dudden 1966 pp. 89‚Äì90 John Loftis focuses on the blatant politics of Fielding's piece and declared, \\"If the political meaning of The Tragedy of Tragedies is mild and ambiguous, that of Fielding's The Welsh Opera [...] is audacious and absolutely clear\\". Thomas Cleary wrote that the revised version \\"is a much better play\\".Cleary 1984 p. 51 Robert Hume believes that, in The Welsh Opera, \\"Fielding daringly vented his penchant for burlesque. Its politicality has often been overestimated, but its audacity is beyond question.\\"Hume 1988 p. 93 Likewise, the Battestins point out that \\"the play cannot have been acceptable to the authorities; it is too impudent in making a public spectacle of the foibles of the Royal Family\\". Harold Pagliaro characterised the play as \\"often droll and always merry.\\"Pagliaro 1998 p. 79 Thomas Lockwood declares that the plays The Welsh Opera and The Grub-Street Opera are characterised by a \\"spirit of fun\\" but are complicated by the 18th- century politics that gave them birth.Fielding 2004 II p. 1 NotesReferences * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe.

Early life  Little is known of Rogers's life, other than what is recounted in the autobiography of William L. Manly, \\"Death Valley in 1849\\", and there are no known photographs or portraits of him. Death Valley, Rescue of the Bennett-Arcane Emigrant party  Rogers is notable primarily for the incident recounted here. In the autumn of 1849, several groups of emigrant gold-seekers were assembled in Salt Lake City, Utah, preparing to head for Southern California via the Old Spanish Trail. Although this route would have brought the emigrants to California about 200 miles south of the gold fields, they knew it was too close to winter to attempt a crossing of the central Sierra Nevada over Donner Pass. At this point, a map was presented to the group by a Captain Smith, who had been hired to guide a different group of emigrants, showing a purported \\"short cut\\" to California that crossed south-central Nevada along the foot of an east‚Äìwest mountain range, along which water and grass for the animals would be available, then into California at a latitude much closer to the gold fields. The groups argued over this proposed short cut, and eventually split up, with some sticking to the original route, and others adopting the short cut. The \\"short cut\\" group included families with children (generally referred to as the Bennett-Arcane party in Manly's book), and several unmarried men, including William Lewis Manly and his friend John H. Rogers. Unfortunately for these emigrants, the east‚Äìwest mountain range shown on the map turned out to be a figment of the map-maker's imagination, and for three weeks the team's westward travel was through barren sagebrush desert with hardly any drinkable water and even less forage for the oxen and horses. At the end of November, they had arrived at the base of a mountain range and started to climb, believing this to be the Sierra Nevada, with the California Central Valley just a few more day's travel on the other side. This impression was horribly wrong: the mountains they were climbing were the Amargosa Range, and on a direct westward course, they had four more ranges to cross to reach California. The route they were following began to descend along a dry arroyo that is today known as Furnace Creek Wash, which deposited the teams in the bottom of Death Valley, with the Panamint Range blocking any further progress westward. They were now completely lost, and both people and animals were on the brink of starvation. The group crossed the valley, heading south along the foot of the Panamints in search of a pass. They camped at a spring, now called Bennett's Well, and determined that their only possibility of survival was to send a small party on foot to scout an escape route and perhaps bring help if a settlement could be found. Two young men volunteered to make this attempt, William Lewis Manly and John Rogers, and they were provided with enough provisions for about two weeks, and all of the money in the camp - about $30 - with which to buy supplies and animals if such could be found. Manly and Rogers started southwest, and after two weeks of walking through the Mojave Desert, with little more than a few pounds of dried meat and a makeshift canteen made of gunpowder cans, they stumbled into a settlement, Rancho San Fernando, 30 miles or so northeast of Los Angeles near Tejon Pass. Here they were able to procure a pair of horses and a mule, and additional provisions, then they began the 250 mile trek back to Death Valley, arriving back at the Bennett's camp after almost a month's round trip journey, and with only the mule still alive, the two horses having died of exhaustion and privation along the return route. This heroic trek, nearly 500 miles through a completely unknown desert wilderness, resulted in the preservation of the lives of all but one of the members of the Bennett-Arcane Party (a Captain Culverwell had died a day or two before Manly and Rogers' return) Events after the 1849 Death Valley march  Manly and Rogers led the Bennett-Arcane party safely back to Los Angeles, after which they parted ways. Rogers spent some time at gold mining, then moved to Gilroy, California in Santa Clara County, where he was the town's first constable in 1852. Later, he settled in Merced, California, where he owned a farm and lived the remainder of his life. Near the end of his life, Rogers was suffering from Mercury poisoning, a common affliction resulting from the use of mercury to extract gold from low-grade ore, and parts of his feet had been amputated, presumably from mercury-induced gangrene.

She proposed the idea of attending to her parents and they agreed. She was admitted after passing the entrance exam, along with her elder sister. However, in the 1913, her brother Zhang Gongquan arranged for her marriage with Xu Zhimo, a rising poet and son of a rich businessman. Upon her parents' urging, Zhang quit school and returned home to prepare for her wedding. Marriage She married the prominent poet Xu Zhimo (Hsu Chih-mo), and gave birth to two sons, Hsu Chi-kai (born 1918) and Peter Hsu (1922 - 1925). After giving birth to Peter, Youyi received a letter from her estranged husband, declaring his intentions to divorce. In his letter, Xu reasoned that \\"marriage not based on love was intolerable.\\" Zhang consented, and signed the divorce papers. Their separation was the first legal divorce based on the Civil Law in China. Career Zhang settled in Berlin in 1922. She studied German intensively for a few months, then enrolled at the Pestalozzi Furberhaus, a kindergarten teachers' college that espoused the philosophy of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.

He stood unsuccessfully for the CPNI in Belfast Bloomfield at the 1953 Northern Ireland general election, taking only 11.8% of the votes cast.Northern Ireland Parliamentary Elections Results: Boroughs: Belfast In 1954, Barr was elected to the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Trades Union Congress, and in 1956 to the Executive Committee of the organisation. In 1959, he supported the formation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU). He became president of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions in 1957, serving until 1978, and President of his own union in 1964, the same year in which he secured recognition of the ICTU by the Government of Northern Ireland. He stood again for the CPNI in Bloomfield at the 1965 Northern Ireland general election, and in the same year became party chairman. The CPNI became part of the Communist Party of Ireland in 1970, and Barr served as chair of the new organisation until 1983. Barr was appointed to the Northern Ireland Economic Council, but resigned in 1973 in protest at the introduction of internment. In 1974, Barr was appointed President of the ICTU. He also represented the ICTU on the ETUC, of which he was the first communist member. Barr opposed the Ulster Workers' Council strike of 1974, and worked with Jimmy Graham to organise a march to demonstrate this. General Secretary of the TUC Len Murray led the march, into the Port of Belfast, with Barr.

The company is one of the best known and top selling German and European porn studios. John Thompson and his films have won or been nominated for several pornography awards, but the perceived extreme nature of its content has led to some of its films being banned in several countries.  John Thompson  John Thompson (real name Raymond Louis Bacharach; born 11 May 1945)Bayerisches Musikerlexikon is the producer and director of all John Thompson Productions. He studied psychology and art in West Berlin. Prior to founding his company, he worked as a director and cameraman with the German porn label Puaka. He founded John Thompson Productions in 1997 and so far has produced more than a thousand films, typically releaseing six new DVDs every month. Bacharach won the 2005 Eroticline Award for best German director and has been featured on the front cover of adult industry publications.  Series  John Thompson Productions logos = German Goo Girls = The GGG series started in 1997. It focuses on bukkake and snowballing, but it also features gang bangs, lesbian sex and very occasionally urolagnia, being the most successful of all John Thompson Productions. GGG is distributed in the United States by Black Widow Productions, who had to move to some sort of larger warehouse to cope with demand for the series. GGG won in the Special Video production category at the 2004 Venus Awards. GGG title Cissie's Cum Show was nominated in the Best Specialty Release ‚Äì Other Genre category at the 2006 AVN Awards. The series also won the Adam Film World Most Outrageous Sex Series award in 2005 and is discussed in the 2008 book Alles √ºber Porno! by Marcel Feige. Importing the GGG title Vollgespritzt & Vollgepisst to Canada is prohibited due to it being deemed obscene by the Canadian authorities. GGG launched the career of Annette Schwarz, so far the only actress to have worked with John Thompson to have gone on to some sort of successful mainstream porn career in the United States. = 666 = Started in 2001, 666 focuses mainly on urolagnia and urophagia, though it also features bukkake.

All 666 films and any other John Thompson films featuring urolagnia are presumably banned in New Zealand, where publishing anything promoting or supporting urolagnia is an offense punishable by up to ten years in prison and possessing films depicting urolagnia is punishable by up to 5 years in prison. The series has a recurring male star who is described as bald, muscular, and tan. Due to the presence of this individual, it is seen in the videos that he splashes urine and rubs ejaculated semen all over the female star's. Some of the female cast members have described him as mentally insane and have refused to work for John Thompson ever since. = Sexbox = Started in 2004, Sexbox mainly focuses on BDSM, erotic humiliation and rough sex, with some bukkake and urolagnia.

Described by the company as a ‚ÄúModular Sensor Surface,‚Äù Sensacell was designed to provide a wide variety of large-scale interactive display applications. A Sensacell surface functions as an interactive touchscreen display, but on a large-scale framework. Individual, tile-like modules‚Äîeach containing LED (Light-emitting diode) lighting and capacitive sensors‚Äîare connected in an open-ended array. As the sensors can read through solid materials, Sensacell networks may be installed within common structural and architectural components, enhancing its configurative flexibility and durability.  Technology  The Sensacell system consists of an array of individual input/output modules, or ‚Äútiles.‚Äù Each module typically contains a combination of capacitive sensors to collect input, and LED lighting to provide output. The tiles are designed to fit within a 6‚Äù square grid,LEDsmagazine.com, 2.2008: ‚ÄúPRODUCT FOCUS: Sensacell incorporates LEDs in interactive sensor and lighting system‚Äù - http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/3/2/28 and are currently produced in three different configurations: HSI64-36-Monochrome [36 single-color LEDs]; HSI64-36-RGB [36 full-color LEDs]; S61-49-White [49 white LEDs]. A constructed surface essentially functions as a multi-touch touchscreen, but with additional capabilities due to the nature of the capacitive sensors used in the tiles. The sensing electrodes can detect, without physical contact, persons and objects moving in proximity to the surface, to a distance of 150 mm. The ability to detect proximity provides a third variable of user input. A traditional touchscreen collects information on the two-dimensional plane of the surface itself; a ‚Äútouch‚Äù or other input is translated into x-axis and y-axis coordinates on a Cartesian grid. Sensacell surfaces can track the relative distance of an object, adding a three-dimensional, or z-axis coordinate, data object that can be captured and processed. Additionally, the capacitive sensors used can detect through solid materials without performance degradation. This allows Sensacell networks to be housed in common, durable architectural materials; any surface from a panel, floor, wall, an entire room or more can be made into an integrated interactive display. = Modes of Operation = Sensacell modules can operate as a stand alone interactive system, or under the control of an external computer.  Autonomous Mode  In its basic configuration, Sensacell surfaces can operate autonomously in response to user input. Several modes of visual feedback are pre-programmed into the tiles, which can be selected as appropriate to the installation. This functionality is typically utilized in architectural and interior design applications to create illuminated surfaces that respond to the presence of people or objects by changing color, brightness or pattern.  Software- controlled Mode  By connecting the array to an external computer, a Sensacell surface can serve as a large-scale, interactive interface and media display. In this configuration, proprietary software is used to collect and transmit data across the network of tiles. The sensor surface can display images, video, and other multimedia content, which can then also be controlled by user input. = Examples of Use = The combination of modularity, scalability and durability inherent in a Sensacell network lends itself to a wide variety of applications. In particular, constructed surfaces can be enclosed in or separated by architectural building materials such as glass, plastic, or wood. Therefore, a large-scale interactive space can be created where the installation of similar technology would be impractical or infeasible. Examples in current use include: marketing and display kiosks;Chipchick.com, 12.2008: ‚ÄúSensacell Modular Sensor Surface is the Future of Store Displays‚Äù - interactive museum exhibits;Gizmodo.com, 8.2008 - ‚ÄúLED Floor Captures Digital Footprints‚Äù - https://gizmodo.com/5036418/led-floor- captures-digital-footprints exercise gaming (exergaming); and user-reactive furniture, interactive architectural and interior design installations; multimedia information displays.

Moline calls itself the \\"Plow Capital of the World.\\" This list of city nicknames in Illinois compiles the aliases, sobriquets and slogans that Illinois cities are known by (or have been known by historically), officially and unofficially, to municipal governments, local people, outsiders, or their tourism boards or chambers of commerce. City nicknames can help in establishing a civic identity, helping outsiders recognize a community or attracting people to a community because of its nickname; promote civic pride; and build community unity. Nicknames and slogans that successfully create a new community \\"ideology or myth\\" are also believed to have economic value. Their economic value is difficult to measure, but there are anecdotal reports of cities that have achieved substantial economic benefits by \\"branding\\" themselves by adopting new slogans. Some unofficial nicknames are positive, while others are derisive. The unofficial nicknames listed here have been in use for a long time or have gained wide currency.

It was originally released on the Nessa label in 1977 and features solo, duo, trio and quartet performances by Mitchell, Anthony Braxton, Malachi Favors, Muhal Richard Abrams, George Lewis, Henry Threadgill, Joseph Jarman, and Wallace McMillan. The 2008 double CD reissue added five unreleased saxophone solos to the album. Reception The 2008 All About Jazz review by Clifford Allen states ‚ÄúNonaah is extraordinarily confrontational music--it presents instrument, composer and materials in a profoundly naked light. Perhaps more important than opening up one's preconceptions about the saxophone, it also complicates the AACM aesthetic.‚ÄùAllen, C. Roscoe Mitchell: Nonaah, September 28, 2008. Track 1 - the first version of Nonaah - was recorded in front of an initially hostile audience that had expected a solo concert by Anthony Braxton. Mitchell responds to the jeering and heckling from a section of the audience by forcefully playing an angular 3 second phrase that crosses the entire range of the alto saxophone and repeating that phrase for about 7 minutes and for a further 2 minutes breaks apart the phrase. Having at last silenced the hecklers his improvisation takes a quieter, more sweet toned direction and moves into more conventional free improvisation, ending with audience applause.

Illinois, 556 U.S. 148 (2009), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court involving whether the rejection of a defendant's peremptory challenge to a juror constituted harmless error.  Background of the case  Michael Rivera was convicted of two counts of first degree murder in 1998. He was then sentenced to eighty-five years in prison. During the pre-trial voir dire, Rivera's counsel used a peremptory challenge to have a juror removed from consideration. The judge deemed the challenge to be based on discriminatory factors and allowed the juror to be seated. Rivera appealed, arguing that the trial judge erred in dismissing the peremptory challenge. The Illinois Supreme Court remanded the case for the trial court to explain why the peremptory challenge in question was discriminatory. The trial judge submitted gender discrimination as the relevant discriminatory factor. Unsatisfied with this explanation, the Illinois Supreme Court held that Rivera was wrongly denied his challenge to dismiss the juror. The state supreme court found no evidence that Rivera's attorney used discriminatory considerations in arguing for the dismissal of the juror in question. Despite this, the state supreme court decided that such a mistake constituted a harmless error.http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2007/November/98609.pdf  U.S. Supreme Court Ruling  James K.

The term barbarous comes from the Greek barbaroi () meaning those who do not speak the Greek Language (barbarians). Often these names were derived from foreign sources and acquired their \\"barbarous\\" nature from the magician's lack of understanding of that language.The New Encyclopedia of the Occult, by John Michael Greer, Llewellyn, 2005, p. 58-59The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy, by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Facts on File (Infobase Publishing), 2006, p.31 Many ancient barbarous names were of Egyptian origin, though there were plenty of Hebrew and Persian names that were corrupted by transcription into Greek. They appear throughout the Greek Magical Papyri, a notable example being \\"ablanathanalba.\\" Iamblichus discusses barbarous names, warning magicians not to translate them even if their original meaning is discovered, due to the belief that the power of the names resided in their sound, not their meaning. The term also appears in the Chaldean Oracles.Magical and Philosophical Precepts, in The Chald√¶an Oracles of Zoroaster, trans. Thomas Taylor and I.P. Cory, ed. W. Wynn Westcott, Theosophical publishing society, 1895.\\"Plethon, Georgios Gemistos\\" by Brigette Tambrun, in Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Occultism, ed.

The Enochian language of John Dee and Edward Kelley introduced a variety of barbarous names to modern magical practice. In the modern era, Aleister Crowley, like Iamblichus before him, argued that the supposed effectiveness of barbarous names rested in their utterance, not their meaning.Chapter IX: Of Silence and Secrecy: And of the Barbarous Names of Evocation from Aleister Crowley's Magick in Theory and Practice, hosted at the Internet Sacred Text Archive See also *Abracadabra *Hocus pocus *Open Sesame  References  Category:Ceremonial magic Category:Magic words ","title":"Barbarous name"},{"id":"21662893","text":"Henri (Enrique) Ciriani (born 1936) is a Peruvian architect and teacher.

A church has occupied the site since the turn of the 4th to the 5th century, but the present structure is medieval, built in about 1100, with a major rebuilding in the second half of the 12th century, and another in 1582. A restoration project in the 1970s largely returned the building to the medieval structure. The bell tower was rebuilt in its present form in the 1390s. The relics of Saint Veranus (San Verano), who was instrumental in the Christianisation of Albenga in the 6th century, are preserved in a shrine. The cathedral interior is well stocked with sculptures and works of art. The 19th century ceiling frescos are by Maurizio and Tommaso Carrega. Other frescos, particularly those in the apse, are of the 15th century. The right hand nave contains a fresco by the artist Il Pancalino of Saint Clare and two donors, and of the Crucifixion with Saints Anthony the Great and John the Evangelist, with the bishop of Albenga. The altarpiece on the high altar depicts Saint Veranus, Saint Michael and John the Baptist. The cathedral also owns two paintings of the late 14th century by Luca Baudo of Saint Eligius and Saint Ampelius; a painting of the Miracle of St. Veranus by Giovanni Lanfranco; and a Madonna and Child with Saints by Orazio de Ferrari (the last two are not publicly displayed for security reasons). History Located in the center of the medieval city of Albenga, the foundation of the original building of worship date back to the reconstruction of the city (between the 4th and early 5th centuries), in the center of the Roman city. It stands on the site with the exact dimensions of the early Christian one. Its rebuilding occurred around 1100, on the ruins of the early Christian church, and again in the second half of the 20th century. According to tradition, in the road that leads from Albenga to Alassio, there was a snake that killed everyone. The people made a procession praying Archangel Michael to kill the snake. During the night he saw a glow coming from the sky and head towards a point on the road, people noticed quickly, and found the snake killed. =The first plant = Organ above the main entrance. An early study of ancient plant early Christian was undertaken between 1964 and 1967 where he ascertained that the structure was a very large basilica. Archaeological excavation discovered the foundations of two column that enriched the altar. With the invasion of Liguria by Lombard king Rothari in 643 that the church was reduced to one aisle Central. Thanks to the division of Liguria in marches, which increased the importance of Albenga and his diocese, the plant was rebuilt in the 11th century in forms to proto- Romanesque nave and crypt. The steps of this reconstruction are still visible in the lower wall of the facade. Structure  The cathedral is today divided into a nave and two aisles with the original columns and pillars supporting ogival arches. Interventions by Nino Lamboglia also allowed the deletion of the elements baroque from sanctuary, now raised to liturgical requirements and to make the proto-Romanesque crypt more visible. The various structural stages that followed are clearly visible in the outside facade, which shows a rose window and decoration arches. The adjacent bell tower was rebuilt between 1391 and 1395 by the architect-canonical Serafino Mignano with the help of master builders Oberto and Tommaso Caressia. An example of Late Gothic architecture, it has five rows of mullioned windows culminating with a polygonal cusp featuring pinnacles at the four corners.

Situated in the Sawback Range, it comprises three limestone peaks (south, centre, north) with the southern peak being the highest followed by the centre and northern peaks respectively. All three peaks can be scrambled with the southern peak demanding the highest difficulty on the west side. The mountain was named in 1886 for Edith Orde who worked as an assistant to Lady Agnes Macdonald, the wife of Canada's first prime minister. Geology Mount Edith is composed of limestone, a sedimentary rock laid down during the Devonian period. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Edith is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 C with wind chill factors below -30 C. Weather conditions during summer months are optimum for climbing.

Early career Born in Wei√üenfels in the Electorate of Saxony in 1735, Otto joined the Saxon army in 1753 as a cavalryman. In the Seven Years' War he fought at the battles of Kol√≠n and the Breslau in 1757. He was also present at several sieges and skirmishes. He joined an Austrian Freikorps raised by his brother Wilhelm and participated in several successful ambushes and raids in 1760-1762. Austrian service At the end of the war he formally entered the Austrian army, joining the Hesse-Darmstadt Dragoon Regiment # 19 as an Oberleutnant. Promoted to captain in 1769 and major in 1777, he transferred to the Graeven Hussar Regiment # 34. Because he improved his new regiment's efficiency, he was rapidly promoted, first to Oberstleutnant in 1783 and Oberst in 1784. In the Austro-Turkish War (1788-1791), he led his regiment in action at Chernivtsi and Cornia. Promoted to General-major in 1788, he continued to distinguish himself against the Turks. In 1793 during the War of the First Coalition, Otto joined the Austrian army in Flanders, serving at the siege of Valenciennes. At the battle of Caesar's Camp on August 7, he commanded an infantry-cavalry brigade in the Count of Clerfayt's column.Smith, p. 51. On September 12, he participated in the cavalry action at Avesnes-le-Sec in which a French force was cut to pieces. On October 30, he led his troops in battle at Marchiennes.Smith, p. 61. He was promoted to Feldmarschal-Leutnant on January 1, 1794 and also became proprietor (inhaber) of the Hussar Regiment # 32. On April 24, while leading two Austrian and two British cavalry squadrons on a reconnaissance toward Cambrai, Otto encountered a force of French cavalry. At this time, he discovered that Emperor Francis II was nearby with his retinue. Fearing that his sovereign was about to be captured, he resolved to attack the enemy. In the ensuing Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies, Otto's troopers smashed a 7,000-man French division, inflicting 1,200 casualties.Chandler, p. 465. The author provides details of the battle but incorrectly identifies Otto as Ott. Two days later, Otto led the main attack in the Duke of York's victory at Beaumont, rolling up the French flank and capturing the French commander Ren√© Chapuis.Smith, p. 75. At the Battle of Tourcoing, he led one of York's three columns. Though the Anglo-Austrian army went down to defeat, Otto performed well. Later career In 1796, Otto declined a command in Italy due to ill- health. He became a member of the Aulic Council and was promoted to full general upon retirement in 1803. He died at his estate near K√∂niggr√§tz on August 7, 1811. References * Chandler, David. Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars. New York: Macmillan, 1979. * Smith, Digby. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book.

Before that period, underground presses had to rely on small, amateurish printing presses. TWZW revolutionized the underground printing scene in occupied Poland, by building new underground presses, and organizing the entire network. By early 1944 TWZW had twelve underground centers, including eight printing presses, as well as a bookbinding center, an offset printing center, a foreign-language publication center, and a chemigraphy (zincography) center. Most of its operations were located in Warsaw. In summer 1944 several centers of TWZW were discovered by the German occupiers. During the Warsaw Uprising in late summer of 1944, remaining TWZW operations in Warsaw went public as Wojskowe Zak≈Çady Wydawnicze (Military Publishing House). Early on during the uprising personnel of TWZW attacked and took control of several large, official printing presses in Warsaw. The last publication of Warsaw TWZW was the 102nd issue of Biuletyn Informacyjny, printed on the night of 3 to 4 October, a day after the insurgents surrendered. TWZW was officially disbanded in January 1945 along with the entire Armia Krajowa. TWZW were mentioned by general Stefan Rowecki Grot in his order 104/43, thanking them for their work.

Its publications were distributed throughout occupied Poland, and in some instances, even abroad. TWZW employed about 50 people full-time (many of them women), many more volunteers (particularly to distribute its publications), and consumed monthly about 5 tons of paper (bought on the black market).

The Young Buddhist Association of Malaysia (YBAM) set up the Sumangalo Award in 1995 to commemorate Ven.Sumangalo for his great compassion, contributions and pioneering spirit in the Buddhist youth movement in Malaysia. Father Sumangalo Memorial Hall is located in Penang, Malaysia Abbotship in Singapore In January 1959 he was offered the honorary abbotship of Poh Ern Shih, thus becoming the first Westerner to be the abbot of a Buddhist temple in Singapore.Piyasilo, 1992: 17‚Äì19. While in Singapore, he assisted Pitt Chin Hui in her translation of the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutra from Chinese to English. He returned to Malaya and spent his later years at Penang Buddhist Association, where most of his Dharma lectures were held.

Sutherland was elected to the California State Assembly in 1910, and re-elected in 1912. Early life Born in Oakland, California, Sutherland spent his childhood in San Francisco and Oakland. He attended Stanford University, where he earned his law degree in 1898. Law Admitted to the bar in 1898, Sutherland practiced law in San Francisco until 1901, when he moved to Fresno, California and formed a law practice with Frank H. Short. In about 1899, Sutherland began his association with legal publisher Bancroft-Whitney Company of San Francisco. He worked first on Walter Maline Rose's 12-volume Notes on the United States Reports, or at least the supplements to this digest of U.S. Supreme Court decisions. He received sole credit for volume 13, the 263-page index published in 1900. He then in 1902 co-authored with James Henry Deering the California Digest of the California Supreme Court's cases found in volumes 126 to 136 of California Reports (1899‚Äì1902). In 1903, Sutherland became a law partner with Joseph P. Bernhard, who had also worked on Rose's U.S. Notes in San Francisco. After he and Bernhard dissolved their partnership in 1904, Sutherland practiced solo until 1906 when he merged his law practice with that of the law practice of future United States Congressman Henry E. Barbour, who had also established his law office in 1903. The Bancroft-Whitney Company of San Francisco published in 1910 Sutherland's widely used four-volume practice guide, A Treatise on Code Pleading and Practice. Designed for use by attorneys in California and other mostly-Western states that required code pleading. Bancroft-Whitney published Sutherland's supplement to the 1910 treatise in 1917. Sutherland also authored a 973-page treatise, Notes on the Constitution of the United States, published by Bancroft-Whitney Company in 1904. This book was reprinted by Fred B. Rothman & Co. in 1991. By 1912, Fresno's dominant industry, raisins, was in terrible shape. Prices were so low that they did not cover production costs. M. Theo Kearney's attempt to organize the raisin farmers had failed in 1904. After his death in 1906, several industry groups tried unsuccessfully between 1907 and 1912 to follow the Kearney model of a capitalized raisin cooperative. A group of prominent growers and Fresno businessmen, and Sutherland as their lawyer, formed the California Associated Raisin Company (later known as Sun-Maid). Similar to the Kearney model, the company had both grower members and nongrower investors. The trustees of a voting trust controlled all the shares and elected the seven directors. A novel feature devised by Sutherland and Fresno lawyers H.H. Welsh and M.K. Harris was the three-year grower contract, subject to a two-year renewal, binding the grower to deliver all of his crop for a guaranteed price. The company signed up 76% of the raisin acreage and raised $800,000 in capital, and began operations in April 1913.Spence, W.Y., \\"The California Associated Raisin Co. ‚Äì Organization of the Company,\\" The Sun-Maid Herald, July 1918. In about 1913, Sutherland left his partnership with Henry E. Barbour and again established a partnership with Fresno's preeminent attorney, Frank H. Short. Short became ill in 1917 and then spent considerable time in San Francisco receiving medical treatment and eventually died in June 1920. Politics A Republican, Sutherland was elected to the California State Assembly in 1910, and re-elected in 1912. Sutherland was the official proponent of Proposition 12, which created the California Railroad Commission (now known as the California Public Utilities Commission) in 1911. In 1913, Sutherland was the author of legislation that took an early step to California's community property law. Sutherland's law gave fathers and mothers joint custody of their minor children and joint right to any services and earnings from those children; prior to the passage of Sutherland's law, these rights were the sole domain of fathers. Sutherland was a delegate to the 1920 Republican National Convention in Chicago, which nominated Warren Harding for President and Calvin Coolidge for Vice President. Banking During World War I, the Bank of Italy (later known as Bank of America) entered the Fresno market by acquiring the Fresno National Bank and People's Savings Bank and control of the First National Bank of Fresno.Walker, Ben, The Fresno County Blue Book, Arthur H. Cawston, Fresno, 1941, p. 174. This competitive pressure forced innovation and aggressiveness on Fresno's locally owned banks, Farmers' National Bank and the Bank of Central California. The Spanish flu epidemic killed the head of the Farmers' National Bank on December 10, 1919, leaving a power vacuum at the bank.Streit, Edwin, Fresno's Pioneer Banks and Building and Loans, 1999, pp. 66-67. The Bank of Central California took advantage of the opportunity to purchase the much larger Farmers' National Bank. However, the day before the bank merger was announced in January 1920, the head of the Bank of Central California himself died from the epidemic at age 38.Eaton, Edwin M., Vintage Fresno, The Huntington Press, Fresno, 1965, pp. 63-64. The President of the Associated Raisin Company then became the President of the bank in March 1920, renaming it Fidelity Trust and Savings Bank, with Sutherland leaving his law firm to become the vice president and manager of Fidelity. After a year of serving as President of both companies, the Fidelity President decided to focus solely on Associated Raisin, and Sutherland was elected to fill the Fidelity vacancy. In July 1922, the Los Angeles Trust and Savings Bank bought Fidelity, and the Fidelity Trust and Savings Bank became its Fidelity Branch. With the acquisition, Sutherland's title became Vice President of the Los Angeles Trust and Savings Bank and Managing Director of the Fidelity Branch. Shortly thereafter, the Los Angeles bank changed its name to Pacific Southwest Trust and Savings Bank.Streit, Edwin, Fresno‚Äôs Pioneer Banks and Building and Loans, 1999, pp. 67-68. Sutherland was instrumental in the planning and construction of the Pacific Southwest Building (later known as the Security Bank Building, then Fresno Pacific Towers, and finally by its address of 1060 Fulton Mall) at the southeast corner of Mariposa and Fulton in Fresno. Construction began in 1923 and the bank moved its offices there in 1925.\\"Fresno's Finest Skyscraper Is Now Complete,\\" The Fresno Morning Republican, January 19, 1925. The building was the tallest building in California located between Los Angeles and San Francisco until 2005. Later career Sutherland served as President of the Fresno County Chamber of Commerce in 1923 and 1924. He was a Director of the Sun Maid Hotel Corporation and was its president for one year. In December 1926, Sutherland left Security First National Bank (though he remained its local counsel and the chairman of its local advisory board until his death) to establish the law firm of Sutherland & Dearing with Milton M. Dearing. In 1930, future federal appellate judge Gilbert H. Jertberg became their partner, and the law firm of Sutherland, Dearing & Jertberg was established in Suite 605 of the Pacific Southwest Building. Sutherland was a director of the California State Automobile Association (part of AAA) in the 1920s. He also was a master of the Las Palmas Masonic Lodge. Death Sutherland died unexpectedly at age 61 of a heart attack while aboard the ocean liner off the coast of Baja California. He had been returning to California from a European vacation via the Panama Canal. He was survived by his wife, Helen, and their adopted son, Keith D. Sutherland, who was a dentist in Fresno.\\"Heart Attack at Sea Is Fatal to W.A. Sutherland,\\" The Fresno Bee, October 18, 1935, p. 1. After Sutherland's death in 1935, Jertberg's appointment as a federal judge in 1955, and Dearing's semiretirement in the 1960s, the law firm of Sutherland, Dearing & Jertberg dissolved. Kenneth Avery later joined Meux & Gallagher. In the 1970s, the firm became Baker, Manock & Jensen. Combining the time between Sutherland, Dearing & Jertberg; Jertberg & Avery; and Baker, Manock & Jensen, the firm occupied the same space on the sixth floor of the old Pacific Southwest Building for 56 consecutive years before moving to another location seven miles north and is now one of the largest law firms in Central California. Sutherland's former bank, Pacific Southwest Trust and Savings Bank later became the Security First National Bank.Streit, Edwin, Fresno's Pioneer Banks and Building and Loans, 1999, pp. 67-68. Security First merged with Farmers and Merchants Bank of Los Angeles in 1956 to become Security National Bank, then acquired Pacific National Bank in 1967 to become Security Pacific National Bank, and was acquired by Bank of America in 1992. After Helen M. Sutherland's death in 1939, Security First National Bank and Sutherlands' son, Keith, litigated the validity of Helen Sutherland's wills. The bank sought to probate Helen Sutherland's 1935 will, which named the bank as executor and trustee of a trust established by the will that would pay the younger Sutherland $150 per month, equip his dental office, and distribute the balance to him at age 35 at the bank's discretion.\\"Sutherland Will Fight Opens Before Jury,\\" The Fresno Bee, January 29, 1940. Keith contended the will was revoked by a later holographic will, of which he could produce only a portion, and that portion had been torn in half. Keith testified at the trial that the second will had been torn on the day he found it, after his mother had died. The jury found for Keith, that the holographic document revoked the 1935 will. However, the holographic document was not admitted to probate, and the judge ruled Mrs. Sutherland died intestate. As her sole heir, Keith inherited her entire $100,000 estate outright.\\"Sutherland Wins Right to Handle Mother's Estate,\\" The Fresno Bee, March 22, 1940.

The action came shortly after the initial Allied landings in Normandy. After a confused engagement during the night the Allies sank one of the German destroyers and forced another ashore, where she was wrecked. Background On 6 June 1944, the day of the first landings in Normandy, the remnants of the German 8th destroyer flotilla, consisting of the Type 36A and , and the (formerly the Dutch destroyer Gerard Callenburgh) were ordered by Vizeadmiral Theodor Krancke to sail from the Gironde estuary to Brest. The order was intercepted by the British which detailed Canadian Bristol Beaufighters from RAF Coastal Command to attack the German ships as they sailed through the Bay of Biscay. In the ensuing raid, the destroyer Z32 was slightly damaged. The German ships made port at Brest, where Z24 and Z32 had their anti-aircraft armament increased. They then put to sea again on 8 June in company with the Flottentorpedoboot 1939 class torpedo boat , the sole survivor of the 4th torpedo boat flotilla, bound for Cherbourg under the command of Theodor von Bechtolsheim, where they would reinforce German positions. The Allied forces learned of the German intentions through Ultra intercepts, and detailed the 10th Destroyer Flotilla to intercept the German ships as they sailed up the English Channel. The 10th Destroyer Flotilla was at this time under the overall command of Captain Basil Jones, who had his flag aboard the . With him were , and , the Canadian ships and , and the Polish vessels and . Jones decided to split his flotilla in two; the 19th Division consisted of the Eskimo, Javelin, Piorun and B≈Çyskawica, the 20th Division consisted of Tartar, Ashanti, Huron and Haida. Engagement The British flotilla were moving westward down the Channel when the German ships were detected by radar just after 01:00 on 9 June. Jones turned his force to meet the Germans, who were by now 30 miles east-northeast of the Ile de Batz. The two flotillas clashed intermittently thereafter, exchanging gunfire and salvoes of torpedoes. Tartar was struck several times, but was able to put out fires and restore her speed. ZH1 was then engaged by both Tartar and Ashanti, with Ashanti launching two torpedoes at point-blank range. One struck ZH1, blowing off her bows. With the ship crippled, her captain, Klaus Barckow gave the order to abandon ship, then scuttled her with depth charges at 02:40. Barckow was among the 39 killed. Twenty-eight managed to reach France, the remaining 140 were picked up by the British. Haida and Huron had meanwhile been pursuing Z24 and T24 until the German ships ran into a British minefield. The Canadians attempted to detour around it, but eventually lost the Germans. Z24 and T24 regrouped, with the intention of returning to engage the British, but finding they were not being followed, they left the area. Haida and Huron returned to the scene and came across von Bechtolsheim's Z32, which had received a heavy pounding and lost contact with the rest of the Germans. There was some confusion over establishing each other's identity, but when the Canadians discovered she was a German ship they opened fire. Von Bechtolsheim fled at high speed, but Z32, having sustained heavy damage, was driven ashore on the Ile de Batz, and then finished off by a squadron of Bristol Beaufighters the next day. Surviving ships Two destroyers from the battle survive as museum ships today. in Hamilton, Ontario, and ORP B≈Çyskawica in Gdynia, Poland.
