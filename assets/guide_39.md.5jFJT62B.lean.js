Biography The son of Jozef Isra√´ls, one of the most respected painters of the Hague School, and Aleida Schaap, Isaac Isra√´ls displayed precocious artistic talent from an early age. Between 1880 and 1882 he studied at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, where he met George Hendrik Breitner who was to become a lifelong friend. In 1881, when he was 16, he sold a painting, Bugle Practice, even before it was finished to the artist and collector Hendrik Willem Mesdag. Two portraits he made in the same year of his grandmother and a family friend, Nannette Enthoven (below), attest to the technical ability he had attained by that age. Starting in 1878, Isra√´ls made annual visits to the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais with his father and in 1882 made his debut there with Military Burial. In the 1885 Salon he received an honourable mention for his Transport of Colonial Soldiers. At this time he was reading √âmile Zola, as was Breitner, and following his triumph at the Salon he spent a year travelling in the Belgian mining districts and elsewhere. Beginning 1886, Isra√´ls lived in Amsterdam and registered with Breitner at the Royal Academy of Visual Arts to complete his schooling. Both of them, however, quickly abandoned the academy for the more progressive circle of the Tachtigers, an influential group of writers and artists of the time. This was a group that insisted style must reflect content and that emotionally charged subjects can only be represented by an equally intense technique. Influenced by this philosophy, Isra√´ls became a painter of the streets, cafes, and cabarets of Amsterdam. At this time he met the Dutch engraver and painter Willem de Zwart who also became a lifelong friend. He often spent his summers with his father in the Dutch seaside resort of Scheveningen near The Hague. Guests included √âdouard Manet and Max Liebermann. Interested by the changing light of sun and sea, he painted many colourful seaside scenes. Towards the end of the century, Isra√´ls was introduced by his childhood friend and portrait painter Th√©r√®se Schwartze to the Amsterdam fashion house at the Leidseplein. Isra√´ls portrayed the whole range of the world of haute couture, from seamstress to wealthy client, gaining access even to the fitting-rooms. Isra√´ls moved to Paris in 1904, establishing his studio at 10 rue Alfred Stevens, , near Montmartre and just yards away from the studio of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec whom he admired, as he also did Edgar Degas. As in Amsterdam, he painted the Parisian specific motifs: the public parks, cafes, cabarets and bistros, as well as such subjects as fairgrounds and circus acrobats. Likewise he sought out the fashion houses Paquin and to continue his studies of the world of fashion. However, he only exhibited once in this period, in 1909. At the outbreak of the First World War he was living in London, where he found new subjects in horse-riding at Rotten Row and in ballerinas and boxers. He returned to Holland for the duration of the war, living alternately in The Hague, Amsterdam and Scheveningen, where he worked primarily as a portrait painter. Amongst his sitters was Magaretha Gertrud Zelle, better known as Mata Hari, executed as a spy in France in 1917. Her portrait can be seen at the Kr√∂ller- M√ºller Museum. Other sitters included Johanna van Gogh-Bonger and the feminist physician Aletta Jacobs, although he also portrayed ordinary subjects such as girls in the street and telephone operators. Following the war, Isra√´ls visited Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm and London. He spent the years 1921 to 1922 travelling in India and the Dutch East Indies, sketching and painting the vibrant life of South East Asia and notably the gamelan players of Bali. On his return, he settled at Koninginnegracht 2, The Hague, , his deceased parents' home, where he remained for the rest of his life, nevertheless making regular trips abroad to London, Italy and the French Riviera. At the age of 63, he won a Gold Medal at the 1928 Olympic Games for his painting Red Rider, an art competition then being part of the games. He died in The Hague on 7 October 1934, aged 69, as a result of a street accident a few days before. His partner at that time was Sophie de Vries.  Art market  On 26 April 2005, one of his Donkey riding on the Beach series realised ‚Ç¨482,400 at Christie's, Amsterdam. The sale example was almost identical to the one in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (below), but larger and a little more delicate in tone. On 24 October 2006, A table at the Restaurant Le Perroquet, Paris realised ‚Ç¨493,600 at Christie's, Amsterdam. In July 2012 the City Archive of Amsterdam organized a solo exhibition to present Isaac Isra√´ls's works in Amsterdam.

Biography As a child Cruz demonstrated interest in sports, particularly softball. He progressed in that sport, becoming one of Puerto Rico's most famous softball players as a young adult. Cruz was an advocate of statehood for Puerto Rico. Because of that, he became a member of the PNP party. After he finished his long and achievement-filled career as a professional softball player, he dedicated himself full-time to politics. Cruz was elected as mayor of Guaynabo in 1980. Guaynabo at the time entered a period of economic progress, alongside other cities of Puerto Rico's so-called \\"metropolitan area\\", such as Bayamon. Like his colleague Ramon Luis Rivera, Cruz became liked by many voters of Puerto Rico's three leading parties. As Mayor of Guaynabo, Cruz put emphasis on the city's sports programs, and, in 1983, the Mets Pavilion (named after the city's BSN basketball team; later renamed Mario Morales coliseum) was opened. He was also president of the Puerto Rican Softball Federation during much of his period as mayor of Guaynabo. In 1989, Cruz became a founding member of a group directed towards uniting mayors of all parties in Puerto Rico, alongside Caguas mayor Angel O. Berrios, himself a member of the PPD party (PNP's main rival) and two other mayors. In his latter years, Cruz suffered from cardiovascular disease. He kept serving as mayor; re-elected three times from 1984 to 1992. In 1993, Cruz suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. The day after his death, his photo appeared on the covers of newspapers like El Nuevo Dia and El Vocero. Alejandro Cruz was elected to the International Softball Federation Hall of Fame in 1993. He is one of ten Puerto Ricans, including Jorge Tanco, Juan Pachot and Ivelisse Echevarria, to be inducted at that sports museum. He was also honored with the naming of a high school, Alejandro Junior Cruz High in Guaynabo, after he died of a stroke.

Chaos Overlords was re-released for Windows in downloadable format by GOG.com in May, 2013. Setting Gangs working for rival Chaos Overlords engage in combat. Chaos Overlords is set in a dystopian cyberpunk future. By 2046, private industries started to purchase bankrupt national governments. By 2050, all governments had merged under one corporation, the World United Solidarity (WUS). WUS became a corrupt monopoly, and attempted to control the population by instituting censorship and banning ownership of weapons, drugs and pornography. Former crime lords and corporate heads arose to exploit the people by creating \\"chaos\\": selling drugs, guns, and pornography, running the numbers, and engaging in extortion and blackmail. These criminals, known as Chaos Overlords, bribed WUS to avoid crackdowns. As gangs joined them and they grew in power, cities became battlegrounds for their struggles to destroy each other in pursuit of money and power.Chow and Rettig 1996, pp. 6-7. Gameplay The player takes the role of a Chaos Overlord attempting to control a city. Gameplay involves hiring mercenary gangs and deploying them on an 8-by-8 grid of city sectors to generate income, occupy sectors and take over the city. The player can choose from 10 different victory conditions. The four timed scenarios involve attaining the most cash, sectors, support, or all three. The six objective scenarios have no time limit and require the player to fulfill a specific goal, ranging from killing all other Chaos Overlords to controlling specific sectors of importance. Reception Chaos Overlords attracted mixed reviews from the gaming press. GameSpot praised its addictive qualities, while Allgame noted its ability to generate strategic depth from a simple game concept. Computer Gaming World criticized the game's rough presentation and monotonous graphics, but commented that dedicated gamers with the patience to look past first impressions would be rewarded with a \\"novel, truly strategic wargame\\". Next Generation found the turn-based, menu-driven gameplay made it less exciting than Syndicate, but praised the variety of scenarios and support for online play, and concluded, \\"It's no replacement for the likes of Warcraft 2 or Duke Nukem 3D, but it's a decent showing from the creators of Heroes of Might and Magic.\\" In a retrospective for IGN, gaming journalist Tom Chick praised the clarity of the game's design, claiming its \\"elegant and exciting\\" gameplay was hampered mainly by a mouse-intensive interface. Andy Butcher reviewed Chaos Overlords for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that \\"If you've got the luxury of a multi-player link-up, Chaos Overlords has a lot to recommend it. Otherwise, there are much better strategy games around.\\" Sequel Chaos Overlords developer John K. Morris began work on a sequel in 2006. , development was indefinitely on hold. In December 2009, Morris announced active development on the sequel with three members of the original development team (names not specified), but provided no indication of a potential release date. Morris updated the Evolution Interactive blog May 5, 2010, to indicate Chaos Overlords 2 was still under development but had been put on hold for another project. The development team has also joined Facebook. A recent post (2013) hinted that the project was still on hold.

Siol.net (December 1). was a British-Slovene economist and prominent dissident from Yugoslavia. Life and work Sirc was born in Kranj, then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, in a wealthy and renowned family of Slovene and Yugoslav patriots. His grandfather was a liberal and monarchist politician and mayor of Kranj, and his father was a local entrepreneur. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Sirc managed to escape to Switzerland, where he established contact with other Yugoslav emigrants. In summer 1944, after the Tito-≈†uba≈°iƒá agreement, he joined the Yugoslav Resistance and served in the Yugoslav Army in Dalmatia, Croatia, and Slovenia until 1945. After the establishment of the Communist regime, he joined other liberals and social democrats, who tried to form a legal political opposition to the regime. In 1947, due to his political activity and friendship with Western diplomats, he was tried in the Nagode Trial and sentenced to death. His sentence was ultimately commuted to twenty years in prison, of which he served seven, much of it in solitary confinement. He spent his time in assiduous reading; he became an expert in Marxist political and economic thought, and he was also able to read the most up-to-date Western, especially English and American, economic literature, provided to him by the Slovenian communists to translate it for \\"internal security purposes.\\" After his release, he escaped to Italy with the help of former TIGR member Stanislav Kamen≈°ƒçek. From there, he moved to the United Kingdom, where he started an academic career. In his various teaching posts since then, including twenty years at the University of Glasgow, Sirc was a leading expert on socialist economics and communist regimes. He was one of the founders of the Centre for Research into Communist Economies (CRCE) in London and headed it. For many years, he lectured on political economy at Glasgow University. In 1962, Sirc was among the co-founders of the opposition platform Democratic Alternative, together with a group of Serb, Croat, and Bosniak pro-Yugoslav emigrants. Activity in post-communist Slovenia After the fall of the communist regime in Slovenia, Sirc was active in Slovenian public life, writing articles, giving interviews, and commenting on political developments and economic issues. In 1990 and 1991, his opposition to the independence of Slovenia caused some controversy. Sirc supported a unified and democratic Yugoslavia and, although he admitted this solution was not feasible at the time, he refused to uphold the idea of an independent Slovenia until the outbreak of the Ten-Day War. He then endorsed Slovenia's decision to break from the Yugoslav Federation. In 1992, he ran for President of Slovenia with the support of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDS), but received less than 2% of the vote. He later claimed that he had been fooled into accepting the candidacy: he believed, according to his account, that the party had really accepted an economically and politically liberal program, whereas in reality, he claimed, it remained strongly linked to the former communist establishment. In fact, as subsequent polls showed, the great majority of the Liberal Democratic Party's voters voted for Milan Kuƒçan in the presidential elections. Sirc later sharply criticised both Janez Drnov≈°ek and Milan Kuƒçan, accusing them of hindering the development of an Open Society in Slovenia. In the late 1990s, he collaborated with the writer Drago Janƒçar and historians Vasko Simoniti and Alenka Puhar in staging an influential exhibition on human rights violations in communist Slovenia called Temna stran meseca (The Dark Side of the Moon). In 2004, he was among the co-founders of the liberal conservative civic platform Rally for the Republic (). In the 2000 and 2004 parliamentary elections, he publicly supported the Slovenian Democratic Party. In May 2010, he became a member of the Slovenian Democratic Party.http://www.demokracija.si/index.php/slovenija/dogodki/957-sirc-lan-sds In his later years, Sirc lived in Glasgow's West End and regularly visited his homeland.

Profile of the City Despite the small territorial dimension of the municipality (257.6 km2) there is a developed agriculture with production of rice and corn and raising of dairy cattle. Nevertheless, the main source of income is in the touristic complex called Rio Quente Resorts which attracts thousands of tourists all year round. It has 7 hotels, including the famous Hotel Pousada, the first to be built. The municipality contains part of the Caldas Novas State Park which protects a plateau region that is the main source of water for the geothermal aquifers of the region. One of the attractions of the resort is the constant renewal of all the water of the pools due to the great volume that springs from its main thermal springs. The volume of water produced by the springs results in a constant flow of 6,228,000 liters per hour, reaching a figure over 149 million liters every 24 hours. Attractions are the hotel complex and the only river with hot-water rapids in the Americas. This river is called the Ribeir√£o das Aguas Quentes. Rio Quente has one of the highest standards of living in the state of Goi√°s. The United Nations Human Development Index of 2000 ranks it in 7th place in the state (out of a total of 242 municipalities) and 460 nationally out of a total of 5,507 municipalities. On a scale of 0.000 to 1.000 it had a rating of 0.806.

It produces and sells creams, soaps, shampoos, shower gels, lotions, moisturisers, scrubs, masks and other cosmetics for the face, hair, and body using only vegetarian recipes, 85% of which are also vegan. The company operates stores in 49 countries globally, with most locations located in the USA, as well as production facilities (called \\"kitchens\\") located in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Germany and Australia. History = Early years = The original Lush store, located in Poole, Dorset, UK. The store also houses a Lush Spa, accessed via the door on the left. Lush store in Westlake Center, Downtown Seattle, Washington Mark Constantine, a trichologist and herbalist who had hoped to go into theatrical makeup, but became a hairdresser in the 1960s, worked from a hair and beauty salon at 29 High Street in Poole, Dorset, UK. In the 1970s he met Elizabeth Weir, a beauty therapist, in the salon. A few years later, they started their own business, named Constantine & Weir, selling natural hair and beauty products. In the early 1980s, Constantine read about Anita Roddick, who had just started The Body Shop. He called and offered some of his products; Roddick placed an initial order of ¬£1,200. Constantine and Weir developed a number of recipes for bath and beauty products and were a major supplier to The Body Shop, until Roddick was advised to take more products in house. The Body Shop then paid ¬£11 million for the rights of Constantine & Weir's recipes. The Body Shop's purchase of their product formulas forbade Constantine and Weir from opening another shop for five years, so they set up a mail order cosmetics company called Cosmetics-to-Go, until it went into administration. = Creation of Lush = In 1995, Constantine and Weir, along with Mo Constantine, Helen Ambrosen, Rowena Bird and Paul Greaves from Cosmetics-to-Go, opened a cosmetics shop on High Street in Poole, creating cosmetics from freshly purchased fruits and vegetables. The company's name was chosen after a customer competition in the store's newsletter. The brand saw greater success after launching a second store in King's Road, in Chelsea, London. = Recent history = In December 2010, Mark and Mo Constantine were awarded the OBE in the New Year's Honours list, for services to the beauty industry. 2018 saw UK recruitment website Indeed, name Lush as the UK's seventh best private sector employer, based on millions of employee ratings and reviews. In March 2019, the company introduced the Lush Labs app, which uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to reduce wasteful packaging. = COVID-19 pandemic response = At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lush offered the public free handwashing in all its stores as a means to help slow down the spread of the virus. However, on 16 March 2020 Lush closed all North American stores but continued to pay staff, with stores in Australia closing four days later and those in the UK closing on 21 March. Later in March, the company announced it was laying off staff in Canada due to the impact that the pandemic was having on its operation, facing a future with a \\"much smaller business\\". Business structure Lush is a privately owned company with a small number of shares available on an invitation basis only. The company operates in 49 countries, with approximately 20% of its stores located in the USA. In 2019, the largest Lush store was opened in Church Street, Liverpool. The 1,380m2 store features a florist, hair salon, perfume library and a spa. The company follows a \\"no advertising policy\\" in which the company does not spend money on TV campaigns or celebrity endorsements and instead relies heavily on user-generated content. However, the company partnered with drag queens from RuPaul's Drag Race; Kim Chi, Detox, and Shea Coule√©, during the Holiday season of 2018 to create photo campaigns for their new products. Products can also be advertised through staff engaging in \\"random acts of kindness\\" where they are allowed to give away products to customers in need of cheering up, are celebrating a special occasion, they have a good relationship with or other reasons. Lush states that it does not have a target demographic, and that as a brand it is \\"trying to make [its] stores welcoming to all\\". = Boxing Day = The company does not partake in Black Friday sales but instead hosts its only sale of the year on Boxing Day. The sale at times will differ from the country that the store is located, as in 2018 the North American stores and website featured a \\"Buy One, Get One\\" seasonal sale, and the UK stores hosted a 50% seasonal items sale. The change began in 2017, when the company attempted to not have an online Boxing Day sale at all, which led to major backlash. Products Lush shampoo bars on display Lush shower jellies Lush produces creams, soaps, shampoos, shower gels, lotions, moisturisers, scrubs, toothpaste tablets, masks and other cosmetics for the face, hair, and body using only vegetarian or vegan recipes. In 2016, Lush produced 41 million products, of which 13.3 million were bath bombs, which are solid spheres of sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, essential oils and natural butters that fizz out when dropped in water, and can produce an array of colours and fragrances. As of July 2012, Lush began selling their \\"Emotional Brilliance\\" makeup collection, which includes liquid lipsticks, liquid eyeliners, and cream shadows. Lush also launched their first mascara, Eyes Right, under the \\"Emotional Brilliance\\" line. Lush products are made in factories or \\"kitchens\\" as the staff calls them, around the world including Poole, Dorset; Toronto, and Vancouver Canada; Zagreb, Croatia; D√ºsseldorf, Germany; and Australia. Most Lush products are to be stored at room temperature, with the exception of their Fresh Face Masks, which require refrigeration due to the absence of preservatives and the main ingredients being fruits and vegetables. Stores do not typically sell products older than four or five months and most products have a shelf life of approximately 14 months, depending on the particular item. In-store catalogues were previously titled as the Lush Times and were produced in a newspaper-style format.  Ingredients and ethics  Lush does not buy from companies that carry out, fund, or commission any animal testing. They test their products on human volunteers before they are sold to the public and has becoming known for its history of campaigning. The founders have been involved in cruelty free cosmetics throughout their careers. Two of the founders, Liz Weir and Mark Constantine, began in 1977 when they launched a treatment business, Constantine and Weir. In the 1980s, the founders worked with Cruelty Free International (previously known as BUAV), with the aim of developing an ethical testing standard, specifically for cosmetic companies. The project with Cruelty Free International was a success and led to the creation of a cruelty-free standard still used today in the field of cosmetics. Since the foundation of Lush, the company has taken a number of strong stances against animal testing and cruelty. Lush stipulate that they will not knowingly purchase from suppliers or supply chains that have been party to animal testing in any way, including the testing of raw materials on animals. This strong stance against different forms of animal testing has meant that there are some countries where Lush refuses to sell its products. An unavoidable exception to this is REACH legislation, which was implemented by the European Union in 2007. According to their website, Lush campaigned against the guideline until it was passed into law. Since then, Lush encourages its suppliers to test for safety using non-animal testing methods and to fund the development of non-animal test methods. In late 2007, Lush introduced its first palm oil-free soap entitled \\"Greenwash\\", utilising a blend of sunflower oil, rapeseed oil and coconut oil. Due to the soap's success, the company decided to switch both UK and overseas production from palm oil to this blend, significantly reducing the amount of palm oil the company purchases. However, many Lush products continue to contain palm oil, and palm-oil derivatives such as stearic acid, cetostearyl alcohol and sodium stearate. Since 2017, Lush has campaigned against palm oil associated orangutan habitat destruction in Sumatra, and since 2018 has purchased two plots of land bordering the Leuser Ecosystem on Sumatra to reforest. Lush products are 100% vegetarian, and 85% of the products are also vegan. They often contain fruits and vegetables such as grapefruit juice, vanilla beans, aloe vera, avocado butter, rosemary oil, fresh papaya, and coconut. However, some products contain lanolin, honey, and/or beeswax. Egg used to be in products but was removed early 2019. Parabens are used to preserve a number of the products. The preferred testing method of Lush products is on humans or synthetic human cells. This form of testing became more prevalent after XCellR8 won the Lush Prize in 2013. XCellR8 then worked with Lush to further their research and development, with the goal of ending animal testing and replacing it with safer alternatives that have greater scientific merit. Lush's cell testing methods use reconstructed moels of the skin and eye to determine a more accurate summary of the effects of an ingredient. In partnership with XCellR8, Lush has run an outreach programme to encourage other cosmetic companies to undertake similar testing techniques. Lush focuses on limited packaging for its product range, or package-free products. Lush packages many creams in its range in recyclable polypropylene plastic black pots. The company also offers customers a way to recycle used black pots by bringing empty ones back to the store for a free Fresh Face Mask for every five returned.  Donations and campaigns  A Lush Charity Pot sold in Russia Lush launched the Charity Pot campaign in 2007, where the profits from their \\"Charity Pot\\" hand and body lotion are donated to small organisations working in the areas of environmental conservation, animal welfare, and human rights. Between 2007 and 2014, Lush has donated more than $33,000,000 to over 2450 grassroots charities in 42 countries, including the campaign to release Guantanamo detainee Shaker Aamer to the UK. Lush is a supporter of direct action, animal rights operations including Sea Shepherd, a group that works to protect whales, seals, and other aquatic animals. Lush has been a supporter of antitax avoidance grouping UK Uncut. In 2007, Lush started openly supporting campaigning groups by sending a dozen cheques for ¬£1,000 each, including road protests groups such as Road Block and NoM1Widening, Hacan Clear Skies (anti-aviation group), and Dump the Dump (which is fighting against an incinerator). In 2012, Lush had a performance artist endure ten hours of animal testing in the window of their Regent Street store window as part of their 'Fight Animal Testing' campaign. Lush Cosmetics donated ¬£3.8m to charities in 2014. In 2014, Lush supported the first Hen Harrier Day, with all its UK stores prominently highlighting the illegal persecution of hen harriers on upland grouse moors. The following year it launched Hen Harrier bath bombs to help fund satellite tagging of these raptors. In Summer 2015, Lush raised ¬£275,000 ($425,000) from the worldwide sale of its \\"GayIsOK\\" soap, with funds going to support LBGTI campaigning groups. In 2016, Lush raised ¬£246,000 ($300,000) from the sale of its \\"Hands of Friendship\\" soap, with funds going to support Syrian Refugees. = #Spycops campaign = On 31 May 2018, Lush launched a campaign aimed to highlight previous abuses by undercover police officers in the UK. The company put up window displays in its stores with a mock-up of a police officer in and out of uniform alongside the tag-line \\"Paid to lie #Spycops\\". In some stores replica police tape was put on the shopfront windows with: \\"Police have crossed the line\\". The campaign attracted immediate criticism from serving officers and members of the public due to its \\"broad brush\\" approach which appeared to suggest that police officers were liars and involved in a cover-up. Many notable figures were critical of the campaign by Lush, including Chief Police Officers and the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid. Lush responded to the backlash by stating that the campaign was \\"not an anti- state/anti-police campaign\\" and that they were aware \\"police forces of the UK are doing an increasingly difficult and dangerous job whilst having their funding slashed\\". They also stated that the campaign was \\"not about the real police work done by those front line officers who support the public every day ‚Äì it is about a controversial branch of political undercover policing that ran for many years before being exposed.\\" Lush suspended the window campaign \\"for the safety of our staff\\" on 8 June 2018, but resumed it on 13 June. Criticism In 2011, Israel advocacy groups StandWithUs and United With Israel UK launched a campaign encouraging consumers to boycott Lush products on account of the company's decision to promote OneWorld's Freedom for Palestine initiative. In 2015, Lush was criticised for insensitivity when it stocked a new product, Lavender Hill Mob ‚Äì a brand of incense inspired by the 2011 London Riots, featuring a graphic of a burning building. Lavender Hill itself had been targeted by looters and rioters, but Lush stated that it was \\"created to emphasise the importance of community\\". In July 2018, Lush Australia admitted owing more than 5,000 staff members up to $2 million in back pay. Lush Australia director Peta Granger said staff across the retail and manufacturing businesses have been underpaid since 2010 due to incorrect interpretations of the retail award. In 2020, The Guardian raised concerns about the labour conditions at the Lush kitchen in Sydney, Australia, due to the high rate of injury reported by factory staff. During the August 2020 resurgence of COVID-19 in Auckland, New Zealand, Lush employees were given 48 hours notice that they would not receive pay for the duration of level 3 restrictions when the stores were unable to open, prompting negotiations between Lush and First Union New Zealand. Lush were ineligible for the government wage subsidy for staff, as their revenues had not decreased enough during this period.

History SOLAR began in 1975 as Soul Train Records, founded by Dick Griffey and Soul Train creator Don Cornelius. The first act they signed was an R&B; vocal quartet they named The Soul Train Gang (Gerald Brown, Terry Brown, Judy Jones, Patricia Williamson, and later Denise Smith), who performed one of Soul Train's many themes, \\"Soul Train '75\\". Their first album was entitled Don Cornelius Presents The Soul Train Gang. In 1976, their second album, The Soul Train Gang, produced by Philly's Norman Harris, was released. The Gang broke up in 1977. That same year, Singer/drummer Arnie Oliver, aka Ahaguna G. Sun, and singer/guitarist Werner \\"Bear\\" Schuchner comprised Sunbear, a little-known soul/funk vocal duo that recorded in Los Angeles in 1977. Earth, Wind & Fire was a heavy influence on Sunbear, and there were also hints of Tower of Power and El Chicano in their sound. In 1977, Sunbear recorded its self-titled debut album for Don Cornelius and Dick Griffey's Soul Train Records, which evolved into Solar Records after Cornelius' departure in 1978. Sunbear broke up without ever recording a second album, and Oliver and Schuchner both went on to pursue other activities in the R&B; world. Oliver became a member of Frankie Beverly's Maze, while Schuchner played guitar on albums by the Whispers, the Soul Train Gang, High Inergy, and others. In 1980, the Whispers recorded Sunbear's ballad \\"Fantasy\\" for their hit album Imagination. Griffey formed a collective called Shalamar, using a host of session singers to record \\"Uptown Festival,\\" a disco-length medley of early Motown hits. After scoring a hit with the recording, he looked to Cornelius to help him put together an actual group to maintain the impact. In 1977, Soul Train dancers Jody Watley and Jeffrey Daniels and former Soul Train Gang member Gerald Brown (who was eventually replaced by Howard Hewett) were recruited to form the new Shalamar, which would become the fledgling label's centerpiece. Cornelius wanted to shut down the label and Griffey paid him $300,000 for his interests in the label. Cornelius wanted to focus his energies on the TV show ‚Äî which was a monster hit and required his full attention to keep it so. With legalities now taken care of, Griffey reorganized Soul Train Records into the newly founded SOLAR label in late 1977. Griffey and Cornelius remained good friends, and as a result SOLAR maintained close ties to the Soul Train show. =Success= SOLAR was known for several others who enjoyed success, including: The Whispers, Dynasty, Lakeside, Midnight Star, Klymaxx, Calloway, Carrie Lucas, Collage and The Deele ‚Äî which introduced singer/songwriter/producer Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds and future music executive Antonio \\"L.A.\\" Reid. Griffey had always believed in giving new talents the opportunity to create and develop their craft, and he was introduced to songwriters/producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis by his A & R rep Dina Ruth Andrews who was the team's first manager, Reggie and Vincent Calloway, and Leon F. Sylvers III. The \\"SOLAR sound\\" was a collective effort, with artists working on each other's sessions and artists encouraged to be creative. Sylvers became SOLAR's house producer in 1978 and his signature basslines and productions helped mould the hit sound of SOLAR, which is funky, progressive dance music infused with soul and disco. =Decline= By 1987, the label began to see its commercial fortunes decline. Contributing to the decline were A&R; problems with Shalamar, primarily, maintaining the group's identity and momentum as former members Hewett and Watley had departed and were having successful solo careers on other labels. The shifting musical directions of R&B;, dance and popular music in general in the late 1980s and early 1990s also contributed to their decline. =Distribution= From 1977 to 1981, SOLAR was distributed by RCA Records, which had also distributed the Soul Train Records label during its two-year run. Griffey formed a second label, Constellation Records (no relation to the Chicago-based indie label founded by Ewart Abner) in 1981, which focused on more contemporary and top forty-geared acts to Griffey's more traditionally \\"urban\\" establishment (including Jon Gibson and Klymaxx). Upon its formation, Constellation was distributed through Elektra/Asylum Records, making it only natural for the main SOLAR label to jump ship to Elektra for distribution when it left RCA. In the meantime, the Constellation label moved to MCA Records for distribution in 1984. Shortly thereafter, Griffey decided to abandon contemporary music to focus all of his attention on running SOLAR, and retaining its sonic theme. Subsequently, MCA bought the Constellation imprint and absorbed its artists, including Klymaxx, which had been its biggest act. SOLAR's relationship with Elektra lasted until 1986. After the Elektra distribution deal expired, SOLAR briefly took up distribution with Capitol Records until 1989, at which time it signed a new distribution deal with Epic Records, which oversaw what would ultimately become its twilight years. In the early 1990s, the label released its last recordings- 1991's Now by Richie Havens and the soundtrack to the 1992 film Deep Cover. Part of the label's back catalog, which includes the pre-1984 Constellation back catalog, were eventually purchased by EMI, with many of its releases and compilations being re-issued through The Right Stuff Records. In 2009, Unidisc Music purchased part of SOLAR's back catalog for Canada, USA and South African territories. BMG owns the rights to part of the SOLAR catalog in the UK and Europe although the rights to SOLAR RECORDS as a trade mark and brand belong to the family of the late Dick Griffey according to the Intellectual Property Office. =UK Relaunch= In 2018, 40 years after the founding of SOLAR Records, the label was relaunched in the UK by the family of the late Dick Griffey, according to issue 77 of UK Publication 'Soul Survivors Magazine' which featured an interview with both Carrie Lucas and new CEO Jessie Tsang. www.thesoulsurvivorsmagazine.co.uk/4664-2/ . At the helm of the relaunched label is Griffey's widow Carrie Lucas, his daughter Carolyn Griffey and British Chinese music promoter Jessie Tsang.

Born in Stockholm, he is the son of songwriter Evert Taube and sculptor Astri Taube. Biography At age 14, Taube began playing guitar. While traveling throughout Europe, he developed an interest in folklore and folk music. He performed in concerts and on Swedish and Norwegian radio while a student at the Royal Beskow School in Stockholm. Taube graduated in 1954 from the Cherry Lawn School in Darien, Connecticut. While he was a student at the school, Folkways Records invited him to record an album of Swedish folk songs. Taube has been married four times, and has four children, born in 1960, 1965, 1979, and 1994. He belongs to an untitled branch of the Baltic German noble Taube family, introduced at the Swedish House of Nobility in 1668 as noble family No. 734.https://www.riddarhuset.se/att/taube-2/ Musical career Taube released his first album in 1954; it included a cover of one of his father's songs. He has since released many albums which include songs written by his father. Several of his most well-known versions of Evert Taube songs come from albums recorded in the 1970s, but he recorded more of them at later stages, including his 2007 album Alderville Road. Referring to that album, reviewer Peter Dahlgren said, \\"Evert had the yarns and Sven-Bertil had the voice.\\" He has recorded songs from both Fredman's Epistles and Fredman's Songs by the popular Swedish 18th-century songwriter Carl Michael Bellman, Paul Britten Austin wrote in his 1967 biography of Bellman that Sven-Bertil Taube's two Bellman albums (released in 1960 and 1963) \\"have sold more copies than any other disc, popular or classical, ever released in Sweden\\". G√∂ran Forsling wrote that Taube helped to start \\"a new era in Bellman interpretation around 1960\\", like Fred √Ökerstr√∂m giving the songs \\"a hitherto unheard earthbound realism\\". Taube recorded work by the poet Nils Ferlin (1898‚Äì1961), whose poems were mostly put to music by Lille Bror S√∂derlundh. Taube also recorded an album with songs by the Swedish songwriter and musician Ulf Peder Olrog, one with Swedish translations of songs by French songwriter L√©o Ferr√©, and one with Swedish translations of songs by Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis. =Selected discography= ;Others *1960: Carl Michael Bellman *1960: Sven- Bertil Taube sjunger Evert Taube *1961: Nils Ferlin *1962: Skillingtryck och andra fina visor fr√•n flera sekler *1963: Carl Michael Bellman, Vol. 2 *1964: Tiggarens opera *1964: Erik Axel Karlfeldt *1965: Pastime with Good Company (with Dorothy Dorow) *1967: Carl Jonas Love Almqvist (with Lilian Sj√∂strand) *1968: Peter och vargen/Orkesterguide f√∂r ungdom *1968: Visor *1970: Evert Taube *1972: 12 visor av Evert Taube *1973: Ulf Peder Olrog *1974: Sjunger Mikis Theodorakis *1975: Caballero!

During the 1980s and 1990s, Taube starred in a number of Swedish films and television series, while keeping his music career alive.

It took place on Friday, May 3, 1241 between the islands of Montecristo and Giglio in the Tuscan Archipelago and ended with the victory of the Imperial fleet. The target of the Imperial fleet was to intercept a delegation of high-ranking prelates from France, Spain, England and northern Italy which were traveling with the Genoese fleet en route to Rome where Gregory IX had summoned a council. Prelude After Frederick's victory at the Battle of Cortenuova in 1237 a conflict erupted in the spring of 1239 between the Pope and the Emperor concerning the question of the Imperial claim to rule over the cities of the Lombard League, an open conflict that culminated in the second excommunication of the Emperor on March 20, 1239. From then on both sides not prepared to compromise carried the military conflict against each other, where the Emperor achieved a victory in the Papal States at the Siege of Faenza, which increasingly threatened the position of the Pope. In the fall of 1240 the Pope issued to the Church dignitaries of Italy, Sicily, Germany, France, Spain and Hungary, the invitation to a council which should be addressed at Easter 1241 in Rome consulting the next steps of the church against the Emperor. In his capacity as King of Sicily Frederick II could easily suppress participation of the Sicilian prelates, but the clergy of the other countries gathered in the following months in order to travel on to Rome. Battle The battle of Giglio depicted in the Chronica Majora of Matthew Paris (1259) The Emperor controlled the land route through central Italy and thus Rome was cut off by land from northern Italy. The council gathered in Nice, where they were first transported by a fleet of the Maritime Republic of Genoa, which was led by a Guelph (Pope loyal) Government in its port. The two legates James of Palestrina and Otto of San Nicola negotiated with the Genoese for 32 armed galleys for the further transport by sea to Rome, and as soon as the embassies of the Lombard cities had embarked the journey should be started. When Frederick II learned of this project he ordered in March 1241 his in Lombardy prevailing vicars, Marino di Ebulo and Oberto Pallavicini, to attack Genoa by land. The Emperor had to upgrade his Sicilian fleet to put the Genoese under pressure from the sea. The Emperor had 27 galleys armed under the command of his son Enzio, along with admiral Ansaldo de Mari. This contingent then sailed to the Republic of Pisa, which was the arch rival of Genoa and staunchly Ghibelline (Emperor loyal). The Pisan fleet of 40 galleys stood under the command of Ugolino Buzaccherini. On April 25, the Genoese fleet set sail from Genoa, but first headed to Portofino where they were anchored there for one or two days. When the crews learned of an attack by Oberto Pallavicino on the town of Zolasco, they intended to come to the rescue, but the two legates prevented it by successfully pushing for a quick drive to Rome. In another stopover in Porto Venere they learned of the union between the Sicilian fleet and that of the Pisan fleet and thus now had an enemy between them and their destination. They managed to sail past Pisa, but not unnoticed since the Imperial fleet was already emerging between the islands of Montecristo and Giglio. Of the battle Matthew Paris recorded: In the following engagement the Imperial fleet proved superior over that of the Genoese, especially since the numerous passengers and their luggage disabled the Genoese in the adequate defense of their ships, which could therefore provide only weak resistance to escape the threat of sinking. The Imperial side succeeded in sinking 3 and hijacking 22 galleys killing 2,000 soldiers, sailors, and priests and capturing the notable prelates as well as the treasuries and correspondence. Aftermath The hijacking of the Genoese fleet was a great success for the Emperor Frederick II. Almost all the high dignitaries of the council got into his captivity. These included the three Papal legates; the Archbishops of Rouen, Bordeaux and Auch, the Bishops of Carcassonne, Agde, N√Æmes, Tortona, Asti and Pavia; the Abbots of Citeaux, Clairvaux, Cluny, F√©camp, Mercy-Dieu and Foix; They were first brought to Pisa and San Miniato, and were then transferred to custody in Naples and other fortresses in the south. On the ships that saved themselves and were able to escape capture were mainly the prelates of the Spain and Arles. Emperor Frederick II proclaimed his victory to be God's judgment and a symbol against the illegality of his persecution by the Pope Gregory IX. The comune of Pisa was excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX and the interdict lasted until 1257. Only with the surprisingly fast death of Pope Gregory IX in August 1241 did the situation seemed to relax at first. As a sign of good will Frederick II had the legates released in order to make way for the election of a new Pope. The newly elected Pope Innocent IV, however, should prove to be an equally intransigent opponent as his predecessor. In 1244 he took his exile seat in safe Lyon, where this time the convocation of the First Council of Lyons was achieved, which formally deposed the Emperor.

Lake freighters on the Great Lakes use conveyor-based unloading gear to empty funnel-shaped holds from the bottom, lifting the bulk cargo onto a boom.

Historically, Pareland was also known as Vuasu (South Pare) and Vughonu (North Pare) to its inhabitants. The location lies on one of the northern routes of the historic East-African long-distance trade, connecting the hinterland with the coast of the Indian Ocean. The people of Vuasu (Asu being the root word) are referred to as Vaasu and they speak a language known as Chasu or Athu. The people of Vughonu (Ugweno, in Swahili) are referred to as Vaghonu (Wagweno in Swahili) and they speak a language known as Kighonu (Gweno in Swahili). Although once constituting a single, greater Vughonu area; current residents of northern Pare recognise two sub- areas based on ethnolinguistic differences: Gweno-speaking Ugweno to the north and Chasu-speaking Usangi to the south. The general interaction of the Pare people with the Ma'a (Va-ma'a) or Mbugu people (an ethnic group with Cushitic origins) has also led to one of the few genuinely mixed languages, reputedly combining Chasu (Bantu) grammar with Cushitic vocabulary (i.e. Mbugu language)Maarten Mous, Leiden University.

Notable Pare blacksmiths include the Shana clan (Shana, meaning blacksmith) who have maintained the tradition to this present day. The Pare are traditionally highly organised in terms of compulsory community work towards sustainable and inclusive development through a philosophy referred to as msaragambo. The Usangi Kingdom between Ugweno to the north and Mgagao in the South was ruled by Mfumwa Sangiwa I (Mfumwa, meaning Chief) who died in 1923, Mfumwa Koshuma Sangiwa up to 1928, Mfumwa Sabuni and finally Mfumwa Shaban Mtengeti Sangiwa up to the abolition of traditional rule following the independence of Tanganyika. In Ugweno, a chief was referred to as Mangi, the term also used by the Chaga. At the peak of its power, the Ugweno state had at its head a Mangi Mrwe (Supreme/Paramount Chief) who was assisted by governing councils, ministers and district chiefs Africa from the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Century.

The Pare were also known as rainmakers, one notable exponent being Mfumwa Muhammad Kibacha Singo, a local ruler of Same who died in January 1981. In these rituals (as well as other cultural practices e.g. healing, initiation, etc.), spiritual figurines were often used that had been artistically sculptured out of clay or wood, and wrapped in either cloth and/or leather. Recent interest in such artefacts from collectors and researchers have unearthed them throughout the western world. =Pre-colonial= Anthropomorphic figurine; 19th century-20th century; terracotta; from Tanzania; Museo de Arte Africano Arellano Alonso (Valladolid, Spain) This region has historically received a substantial population of people from the Taita region of present-day Kenya. The Pare area was also inhabited by Cushitic groups like the Mbugu in Ugweno who were eventually assimilated into the Pare communities. In addition, the inhabitants reveal migration occurred back and forth throughout the region, and the Pare people should be viewed as a part of the bigger population inhabiting the entire Kilimanjaro Corridor. Shana Dynasty (pre 16th c.) Channeled Natural Water in Ugweno This era can be categorised as the ‚Äòage of skill‚Äô for the North Pare communities. Although little evidence remains about this era due to ‚Äòthe great Shana disruption‚Äô, records show that the Ugweno (or Vughonu) area was known throughout the region. It was ruled by the Shana clan for centuries and became known as the \\"Mountains of Mghonu\\", after an early notably famous Shana ruler, from whom it got its name. It is the skill of the blacksmiths and the resulting valued iron products that made the area popular, that eventually led to the influx of foreign groups. Archaeological evidence of iron smithing activities include items collected by Hans Fuchs in the early twentieth century in North Pare, held in the ethnographic collections of the N√°prstek Museum, PragueIles, L., Stump, D., Heckmann, M. et al.

This era can be categorised as the ‚Äòage of discipline and expansion‚Äô of the North Pare communities.

South Pare In South Pare, where the dry foothills and plains were populated by Cushitic- speaking peoples and small Bantu-speaking groups before the 1700s,N. Thomas H√•kansson. Rulers and Rainmakers in Precolonial South Pare, Tanzania: Exchange and Ritual Experts in Political Centralization. Vol. 37, No. 3 (Summer, 1998), pp. 263-283 saw an influx of immigrants from neighbouring communities that included Taita people as well as those escaping civil war from North Pare. This region had a separate rule from the north, and its own evolution of political systems. =Colonial= The Germans imposed an administrative rule over the area (1881-1919), then the British colonial era (in the area) lasted until 1963 when the chiefdom was abolished by an independent Tanganyika government. At the start of the 20th century, the population of South Pare (now known as Same District) was estimated at 22,000Naval Intelligence Division. (1920). A Handbook of German East Africa. London: Naval Intelligence, Admiralty, HMSO. comprising an ethnic group called Asu or Pare who are speakers of Chasu or the Pare language. They are patrilineal and were in several areas organized into small chiefdoms. = Independence Movement = The Pare Union formed in 1946 was one of Tanzania's first ethnic-based nationalist movements to begin activism against the colonial system. Among many grievances, was the exploitation through the production of export crops particularly Sisal and Coffee. Like many other ethnic-based political groups in Tanganyika, The Pare Union then became part of the Tanganyika African Association (TAA) which later became the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) in 1954. This avoided groups like the Pare Union forming into full political parties that were ethnic in orientation. Moses Seenarine writes of the contribution of Pare women in the struggle: 'The Pare women's uprising in northwest Shambaai, Tanzania, occurred in early January 1945 and continued with demonstrations into 1946, involving thousands of women. It began in Usangi, one of the chiefdoms, when the district commissioner arrived for discussions with the local chief. A crowd of hundreds (if not thousands) of women appeared, demanding an explanation of mbiru, a system of graduated taxation. When the commissioner tried to leave without addressing the women, they became enraged and mobbed the assembled officials. Two days later, women surrounded the chief's house singing songs, and ultimately stoned officials and battled police.' The Mbiru protest by the Pare people refusing to pay colonial tax was eventually led by Paulo Kajiru of Mamba. The Pare eventually managed to defeat this tax system, and went back to the flat rate of tax in 1947.https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/pare-people-tanzania-defeat- new-tax-system-1945-46 This remains as an important historical event in Tanzania. =Post-colonial= The disruption of indigenous practices based on historical knowledge during the colonisation-era failed to appreciate the cultural sustainability of Pare communities. As documented on archival sources and oral histories, the altering of post-colonial land management in the North Pare Mountains had an effect on environmental conditions Sheridan, Michael (2004). The environmental consequences of independence and socialism in North Pare, Tanzania, 1961-1988. (Working papers in African studies).. Colonial forest management and water policies were all abandoned, affecting villagers in many aspects including environmental degradation and a drop in management capacity. It has been argued that the symbolic meaning of cultural practices, in the management of trees for instance, were more than rooted in local beliefs. But they also had a wider political and economic influence as well as knowledge dissemination for cultural preservation.  Economy  From the 1940s, the Parelands flourished from the growth of the coffee economy von Hellermann Pauline. Tree Symbolism and Conservation in the South Pare Mountains, Tanzania. Conservation and Society. 2016. Volume. 14. Issue Number 4. pp368-379. DOI: 10.4103/0972-4923.197615. Consequently, modern Parelands are by Tanzanian standards, quite prosperous as its infrastructure of roads, electricity, telephones, and piped water supply attests. The area's chief produce is tea, coffee, sisal, and cinchona. Rice is grown in the swampy plains. An older infrastructure of irrigation furrows, stone-lined terraces, and sacred forests lies alongside these newer technologies and shows that the Pare landscape has been carefully managed for centuries. In 1890, for example, a German geographer praised the area's stone terraces as being similar to European vineyards and stated that the North Pare irrigation system was a \\"truly magnificent achievement for a primitive people\\"Baumann, O.(1891), Usambara und seine Nachbargebiete. Allgemeine Darstellung des Nord√∂stlichen Deutsch Ostafrika und seiner Bewohner auf Grund einer im Auftrage der Deutsch- Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft im Jahre 1890 Ausgef√ºhrten Reise von Dr. Oscar Baumann, Dietrich Reimer, Berlin. It has been argued that the establishment and management of the irrigation infrastructure system depended on institutions which could contribute to knowledge of the development of irrigated agriculture.Mattias Tagseth (2008) Oral history and the development of indigenous irrigation. Methods and examples from Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift - Norwegian Journal of Geography, 62:1, 9-22, DOI: 10.1080/00291950701864898  Culture/Tradition  = Traditional Food = Makande is a typical dish of the Pare tribe, who live in the Pare Mountains, and is popular throughout Tanzania. The dish is a kind of stew of maize, red beans, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and chicken stock, and it‚Äôs normally prepared on Friday and lasts through Sunday evening, which gives people more time to socialize during the weekend without worrying about cooking‚Äîthe food is kept in a big clay pot on the damp ground so it stays cool. Kishumba is another traditional food, it is a kind of banana cooked with red beans and crushed to make a hard porridge. Vughai is yet another traditional food, it is kind of hard porridge prepared by banana, cassava or maize flour (or a mixture of both). It is served with either vegetable, beans or meat/fish/chicken stew (or both if available). When served with meat/chicken, it is considered as a welcoming dish for guests. There are also special foods given to women after delivering, to assist in their quick recovery. = Traditional Medicine = Before the introduction of western medicine, there were certain diseases that were cured using traditional medicine. When Lutheran missionaries were actively introducing Christianity and western style medicine in north Pare and later in south Pare from the early 1900s, it was acknowledged: ‚ÄúThe Pare people did not embrace the modern institutions introduced by the missionaries as readily as the Chaga. The stronger position of local healers meant that traditional medicine was never rejected as an inferior or backward tradition ‚Ä¶‚Äù.Moland, KM 2002. Giving birth in Kilimanjaro.

Mtoro (diarrhea), made ‚Äòthe child as thin as firewood.‚Äô Ash of the root of wild banana was administered orally as its medicine. The most prominent traditional belief within the Pare community was when a baby's milk teeth grew from the upper jaw; they believed it to be a curse to the society and thus killed the baby by throwing them off a large rock with a steep slope facing down a mountain. Pare people are known to have a variety of medicine for all sorts of diseases, largely enabled by the fertile area with natural vegetation and an unpolluted land with few people. = Traditional Appearance = Traditionally, the Vaghonu were marked by a black streak running from the middle of the forehead to the nose. The unmarried warriors were characterised as muscular and their bodies plastered with grease and a red clay. They had different hairstyles ‚Äì fully shaven, cut at the crown, worn in a thatch hanging down their necks, and twisted into thin dreads (most common). The men carried spears and shields and they wore a piece of cloth or hide hanging down across their breast.Across East African Glaciers: An Account of the First Ascent of Kilimanjaro By Hans Meyer. London: Longmans, Green, and Co., and New York: 15 East 16th Street. 1891 In nearby Shighatini, missionaries managed to take a picture (in the year 1902) of the Pare men in traditional clothing, refer to link: Pare Men Wearing Traditional Clothing. The women wore a garment of hide fastened around their waist. They had spirals of iron wire as arm and leg ornaments. They also wore large earrings made of beads, thick necklaces of brass and wooden ear stretchers decorated with iron. = Traditional Housing = The Pare built two types of round houses: (1) They used a wooden framework to create a cone-shaped house, that was likely fastened out of ropes from tree trunks, with a pitched roof made of plant fibre stretching down to the ground. Refer to link: Round House 1 (2) The wooden framework covered with leaves is only used as a roof in this second model, but the framework is covered with a cementitious soil available in the Pare mountains to create round walls. Refer to link: Round House 2. = Sacred Sites = The origins of a clan can be traced through the location of their sacred sites. For instance, despite the Shana having migrated to other parts of Pareland, their sacred sites remain in Ugweno signifying their place of origin. Sacred sites can be referred to as Mpungi (for lineages), Mshitu/Mtiru (for clans), and Kwa Mrigha or Kwa Kivia (for ancestors). At these sites, various tribal ceremonies, customs and/or initiation were conducted.Jafari R. Kideghesho (2009) The potentials of traditional African cultural practices in mitigating overexploitation of wildlife species and habitat loss: experience of Tanzania, International Journal of Biodiversity Science & Management, 5:2, 83-94, DOI: 10.1080/17451590903065579 = Cultural Misconception = In Tanzania, referring to someone as ‚ÄúPare‚Äù is synonymous with calling them ‚Äústingy‚Äù or ‚Äúcheap‚Äù. Even during Tanzania‚Äôs history of economic hardship, the Pare believed in making ends meet through adopting strict budget plans, albeit having insufficient funds. Given their honest and direct nature about their economic circumstances, this has been misinterpreted and stereotyped nationally. However, culturally the Pare just strive to be open and fair, hence a lack of hypocrisy in declaring their finances as modest and incorruptible (despite the odds) is viewed as the right thing to do.

Lunawada is the administrative headquarters of the Mahisagar district and one of most developing town of central Gujarat. Lunawada was formally a Taluka, administrative subdivision, in the Panchmahal district up to 15 August 2013. The name Lunawada is derived from Luneshwar Mahadev, a temple of Lord Shiva. Lunawada is surrounded by water, the sources being the Panam river, Vasant Sagar, Kishan Sagar, Kanka Talav, Veri, Mahi River and Darkoli Talav lake. History Lunavada State flag Lunavada was the capital of Lunavada State, a princely state that predated the town's existence by around 200 years, having been founded in 1225. The state's rulers claimed descent from the Solanki or Chaulukya dynasty; they constituted one of the sixteen branches of the Solanki tribe and were known as the Virpura Solankis. Before Lunavada was founded, the state's capital was the town of Virpur, across the Mahi river to the west of Lunavada. According to traditional accounts, the town of Lunavada was founded in 1434 by Bhim Singh, the rana of Virpur. On a hunting trip across the Mahi river, Bhim Singh ended up lost and separated from his companions. He came across an ascetic's hut and, after respectfully greeting the man, was told that, while passing east through the forest, he would see a hare crossing his path. The ascetic told him that he was to found a city on that spot. Bhim Singh did as he was told and saw the hare at a place now marked by the Bhavaneshvari Mata temple; there he built the town. Since the ascetic was a devotee of the god Luneshwar, the rana named the new town Lunavada out of respect. James M. Campbell noted that the story of the ascetic and the hare was a common founding legend for cities. He suggested that, instead, the name Lunavada was in honor of Bhim Singh's relative Lavanprasad, the ruler of Dholka. Campbell said that Bhim Singh was probably driven across the Mahi by the growing power of the Dholka kings, and that he chose Lunavada as the site of his new capital because of its strong defensive position. A rugged hill, subsequently fortified, overlooked the town, and a tangled forest behind it offered a safe escape route if necessary. Bhim Singh's direct descendants continued to rule Lunavada until around 1600. The first half of the 1500s apparently saw conflicts with the Gujarat Sultanate; Bodi Moghal, a general of Mahmud Begada, conquered nearby Balasinor in 1505, and a disturbance of some sort occurred in 1545. A paper dating to 1586 indicates the territorial extent of Lunavada State at the time: it still included Virpur and its dependent villages, which later came under Balasinor State, as well as some territory in the north conquered from the thakurs of Meghraj, who also belonged to the Virpura Solanki clan. However, the territory to the south of the Panam river, which later became part of Lunavada State, was not yet under Lunavada's control. Instead, it was controlled by the rulers of Godhra as well as a branch of the Solankis based at Jhanor, near Thasra. Around 1600, the direct line descended from Bhim Singh died out, and a collateral relative named Kumbho Rano was brought from the village of Gandhari to become king of Lunavada. One of his descendants, Nar Singh, laid the foundation of the historical Lunavada town wall in 1718; four years later, in 1722, he paid a tribute of 80,000 rupees to Haidar Kuli Khan, the Mughal viceroy of Gujarat. Throughout the 1700s, Lunavada State lost territory to the neighbour Balasinor State, but it gained new lands in the south due to the decline of the Godhra chiefs and the Solanki thakurs. In the census of 1872, Lunavada was recorded as having a population of 9,662, of whom 7,206 were Hindus and 2,456 were Muslims. During the British Raj, Lunavada State was one of the princely states under the Rewa Kantha Agency of Bombay Presidency. It was a second class state in the Rewa Kantha Agency. One important ruler was Wakhat Singhhji (1867‚Äì1919) a Solanki Rajput Maharana of high lineage. The 1901 census records that the population had a decrease of 28% in the previous decade, due to famine. The last ruler of Lunawada was Maharaja Vir Bhadra Singh. The best known historical place near Lunawada is Kaleshwari where there are Pandav chori, foot prints of Bhima, ancient water kund (small bodies of water sometimes sanctified), several vaavs (large wells with accessible steps to the water level) and the Lord Shiva temple. Col.

Near Lunawada there is a village named Limadiya where the palace is situated. =Temple= Lunawada is known for the temple of Luneshwar Mahadev. This ancient temple of Lord Shiva has a lot of religious importance as it is said that the Pandavas dwelled at this temple during their stay in the forest. The statue of Lord Shiva Lingam is of white stone found in the quarries of Madhya Pradesh. There is a Saint Kabir Ashram opposite to this Shiva temple. All the walls of this Ashram are engraved with the Dohas of Saint Kabir. Another ancient temple of Bhairavnath Mahadev is situated near the Luneshwar Mahadev temple. This temple has a statue of Bhairav and one of Lord Shiva. The next attraction is the temple of Melia Mahadev, which is 2 miles away from Lunawada. The local people come here to pray to fulfill their wishes and desires. A temple named Mitha Ganesh ni deri situated in mandvi bazar (beside pipli fali) is held here. People ‚Ä¢The town contains people of every kind of religious persuasion, Hindus, Jains, Sindhis, Muslims and Dawoodi Bohras. It has Hospitals and clinics for surrounding Talukas. The town has facilities like a Gymnasium, a Town hall, theater, Jawahar Garden, public schools, a Religious school, and restaurants. ‚Ä¢Lunawada people have made achievements in fields of business, education, banking, literacy, and health. Lunawada has a large NRI population thriving in different foreign countries like Kuwait, UAE, Australia, Canada, Oman, US, Hong Kong, and Africa. Godhra-Lunawada Railway The Godhra-Lunawada Railway was a 2ft 6in/762 mm narrow gauge(NG) line, opened in 1912 and reached Lunawada in 1914. The railway length of 26 miles(41km) and was served from the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway (BB&CIR;) station Godhra. The railway was owned and managed by the Gujarat Railways Company. The company was taken over by the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway(BB&CIR;) in 1922. An Agreement was signed 30 Apr 1914 between the Secretary of State for India and Killick, Nixon & Company of Bombay with partners Lowther Robert Windham Forest, Sir Henry Edward Eddleston Procter, Thomas William Berkett, Walter Henry Ogston and Harold Percival Hebblethwaite.

Biography Gregory was born in Redding, Connecticut and relocated to Albany, New York as a child. He worked as a clerk in the office of the New York State Comptroller for fourteen years, and became Chief Clerk of the Canal department. Gregory was a member of the guard of honor to receive General Marquis de La Fayette on his visit to the United States in 1824. Moving to Jersey City from New York City in 1834, he became involved in politics. He was elected the first mayor of newly incorporated Jersey City in 1838 and served to 1840. During those years he simultaneously served as a member of the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders. (Jersey City was in Bergen County until 1840, when Hudson County was created.) He served three separate terms as mayor, being elected again in 1841 and serving to 1842. He served three terms on the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders, and was at one time a director of sixteen different railroads. A member of the Whig Party, Gregory was elected in 1846 to the United States House of Representatives, serving one term in office from March 4, 1847 ‚Äì March 3, 1849, and chose not to run for re-election. After ten years, Gregory was elected for a third term as mayor in 1858 and served to 1860. Gregory was involved in banking and railroads. Upon returning to private business, Gregory was one of the incorporators of the \\"Mutual Benefit Life and Insurance Company of the County of Hudson\\" along with several partners including his last predecessor as mayor of Jersey City, Samuel Wescott. An original stockholder of the Adirondack Iron and Steel Works in Jersey City, Gregory bought the company in 1863. Adirondack was the oldest continually operating cast-steel works in the United States. Gregory married Ann Marie Lyon of Albany, New York on September 10, 1822. They had 14 children; Caroline, Mary Louisa, Clara Bartlett, George Washington, Joseph, Dudley Sanford, Ann Eliza, Ann Marie, Walter, Charles Edward, Benjamin, Laura Drew, Archibald McIntyre and David Henderson. Gregory died in his home in Jersey City on December 8, 1874. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn with his wife who had died three years earlier on May 18, 1871. At the time of his death, Dudley's estate was estimated to be worth $1 million and his will provided for annual payments to be made to some of his children and grandchildren, sister-in-law, and \\"Adam Thompson, a colored servant.\\" See also *List of mayors of Jersey City, New Jersey References External links *Dudley Sanford Gregory at The Political Graveyard * Category:1800 births Category:1874 deaths Category:American steel industry businesspeople Category:Burials at Green-Wood Cemetery Category:Mayors of Jersey City, New Jersey Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from New Jersey Category:County freeholders in New Jersey Category:Clerks Category:People from Redding, Connecticut Category:New Jersey Whigs Category:Whig Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Businesspeople from Jersey City, New Jersey ","title":"Dudley S.

PRR Board approved $595,000 for the construction of this experimental Class dual service locomotive on Oct,9 1940, it was built in March 1942, its streamlined shrouding, according to an interview of noted an interview of John W. Epstein, Special Projects Manager and vice president, Raymond Loewy & AssoC., ,Keystone magazine vol. 26, number 3, Autumn 1993 was designed by Raymond Lowey, but due to WWII, there was no publicity about it. The Q1 was a duplex locomotive, it had a wheel arrangement of 4-6-4-4, comprising a four-wheel leading truck, two sets of driving wheels (six followed by four) in a rigid locomotive frame, and a four-wheel trailing truck. The first group of six driving wheels was driven by a pair of cylinders mounted conventionally in front of them, while the rear four driving wheels were driven by cylinders mounted behind them on either side of the firebox.Staufer, Alvin (1962). Pennsy Power. Staufer. pp. 216‚Äì225. LOC 62-20872. As a locomotive designed for dual service like PRR M1sBlack Gold - Black Diamonds: The Pennsylvania Railroad & Dieselization\\" Volume 1 by Eric Hirsimaki, July 1997, Page 109 to 112, it was given a larger sized driving wheels at which was as large as the Grand Trunk Western class U-4-b 4-8-4 \\"Northern\\" type. The Q1's streamlining was in the form of a bluntly pointed nosecone on the smokebox front as well as extended side skirts covering up the locomotive's pipework. The cab front was set at a rakish angle. The tender, although given a freight locomotive's \\"doghouse\\" on the rear deck for the head-end brakeman, was otherwise a streamlined affair very similar to that used on the S1, S2, and T1 passenger locomotives. Q1 was the last dual service locomotive designed by Pennsylvania Railroad, but there is no substantial evidence showing that it was assigned to passenger service. Q1's design was able to reduce dynamic argument by 60% compared to the J1 class above 70mph, but it exceeded the railroad's 50mph speed limit for the freight train.Black Gold - Black Diamonds: The Pennsylvania Railroad & Dieselization, Volume 1 by Eric Hirsimaki, July 1997 On April 10, 1942, H.W. Jones, Chief of Motive Power, told Altoona that the Q1, #6130, would be considered a passenger engine as far as striping and lettering were concerned.The Keystone Magazine Volume 39, Number 2, Page 30 During its short service life, it spent more time in shops or the engine-house than being run, accumulating only about 165,000 service miles in its career (1942‚Äì1949).Keystone magazine, vol. 39, no. 2, p. 30 Its first revenue run occurred May 31, 1942, from East Altoona to Enola with 125 cars and 10000 tons, a 40mph was made on a level track at 40% cutoff. Keystone Magazine Volume 39, number 2  page 18 In October 1943, it was assigned to the St. Clair Avenue Enginehouse in Columbus, Ohio and ran mostly in the Ohio area and to Chicago, Illinois. In December 1944 it appeared at a PRR exhibition in Chicago's Union Station entitled \\"Presenting a Line of Modern Coal-Burning Steam Locomotives.\\" At some time during the next year, it lost much of its streamlining, the nosecone being removed in favor of a conventional PRR smokebox front including the keystone numberplate placed centrally on the small smokebox door. A headlamp bracket mounted above that door also hung the locomotive's bell. The side skirting was cut back to expose pipework and fittings for easier maintenance. The skyline casing atop the boiler remained in place. The Q1 remained in service until July 1949, after which it was placed in storage. It was dismantled around 1949 and was removed from the company's book in January 1952. The PRR considered the Q1 design unfit for series production, and railroad historians consider it mostly a failure. The backward-driving rear cylinders were a poor choice; mounted next to the firebox, each constrained the other's size, and the area by the firebox was dusty and hot, which increased cylinder wear. These problems had previously been encountered on the B&O;'s N-1 duplex. The length of steam pipes required also meant a fair degree of power loss. Added to this, the passenger-locomotive sized drivers were not a good choice for freight service. From its experiences with this locomotive, the PRR came up with an improved design, the Q2. This had smaller drivers, cylinders mounted in front of the wheels they drove, built largely unstreamlined and was designed for freight service only.

It is located at the end of Eglantine Avenue at the junction with the Lisburn Road and holds regular services. The parish extends from Elmwood Avenue to Adelaide Park, and from the Malone Road to the Lisburn Road. History The part of Belfast south of Queen's University between the Malone and Lisburn roads, known as the 'Malone Ridge', underwent rapid expansion from the middle of the 19th century, as a prosperous and fashionable suburb of large detached villas and grand terraces. At the time, the Church of Ireland presence in this area was limited to the old Malone Church, as well as Christ Church in College Square, neither of which was deemed an appropriate place of worship. Following a generous bequest by Andrew Thomas McClean for the endowment and construction of a new parish church, the architect John Lanyon of Lanyon, Lynn and Lanyon was appointed in 1866. Building work, by Messrs. Lowry and Son, commenced in 1869 and St Thomas's was consecrated on 22 December 1870. Architecture alt=Gothic-arched stained glass window, depicting a shepherd with his flock. St Thomas' Church was designed by architect John Lanyon, and completed in 1870. In the same year, Lanyon's firm completed Belfast Castle. Other notable examples of their then recent work in the city included Clarence Place in May Street (now occupied by Lambert Smith Hampton), Moore and Weinberg's warehouse in present-day Donegall Square North (now housing the Linen Hall Library) and the main building at Queen's University (now called the Lanyon Building). St Thomas's is one of the grandest and most fully finished examples of High Victorian Gothic ecclesiastical architecture, not only in Belfast, but in Ulster. Built of white Scrabo sandstone with finely dressed masonry round doors and windows, it is adorned with red sandstone banding and coloured marble discs and colonnettes to the tower and spire. The exterior is a confident exercise in eclectic design: generally the style is Early French Gothic, but the polychrome effects point to an Italian Gothic influence. There may also be an Early Christian Irish reference in the round stone-capped stair turret. The date 1870 is inscribed over the north doorway. Probably because of constraints imposed by the sloping site, the orientation of St Thomas' is unusual, the chancel facing north. In 1888 the church was enlarged at the south end, to a John Lanyon design, when the southwest porch was added, as well as the internal gallery with its Gothic timber stairway. Along with the increase in the length of nave and aisles, this extended the seating capacity to over 1,000. =Internal features= The interior with its tall, open timber-trussed roof is decorated with string courses and brickwork of contrasting colour, as well as carvings and mosaics. Elegant features, such as the narrow Gothic windows in the chancel and the slender timber trusses, mingle with the robustly carved foliage which adorns the capitals to the nave columns and the black-banded red brick arcade itself. The capital above the pulpit with its four heads of angels is more delicately executed than the rest and is the only one on which figures appear. Carvings of the symbols of the four Evangelists ‚Äì man, lion, ox and eagle ‚Äì can be seen in the chancel next to the windows of Saints Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which flank St Thomas and St Paul in the two central lancets and there is finely carved tracery on the wall panels as well as on the oak altar. The stone pulpit is fairly heavy in style but elaborately ornamented. Attractive original wrought iron light fittings are still in use in the nave. Eight modern roundels on the chancel wall to the left and right of the altar are symbolic representations of aspects of the Holy Communion. There are many very fine stained-glass windows throughout the Church, about 45 windows and panels in all. Much of the pre-war glass is by Heaton, Butler and Bayne of London. The greater number of the windows depict scenes from the life of Christ and familiar Biblical passages, such as the Parable of the Sower and the Parable of the Talents. The Resurrection also figures prominently. A plan of the windows, with explanations, is available in the church. The Hill organ of 1874 was enlarged by its builder in 1906, but has remained essentially unaltered since then, which makes it an instrument of considerable and national significance. alt=Photo of a church and tower with spire, partially hidden by the bare branches of trees. The peal of eight bells in the tower was presented by Robert Atkinson of Beaumont, Malone Road, in 1870. In 2008 the church underwent a significant refurbishment by Killowen Contracts, following designs made by architects Consarc Design Group. =Rectory= The adjacent rectory was also designed by Lanyon, Lynn and Lanyon and built in 1871. A fine red brick residence, this is also decorated with bands of contrasting colour. Above the front door is an attractive sandstone carving of an angel playing a lute. The most recent rector is the Reverend Paul Jack.

The park includes of pine flatwoods and a live oak hammock. Also called the Dade Massacre site, it preserves the Second Seminole War battlefield where tribal Seminole warriors fought soldiers under the command of Major Francis L. Dade on December 28, 1835. Each year, on the weekend after Christmas (as close to the original date as possible), the Dade Battlefield Society sponsors a reenactment of the battle that started the Second Seminole War. Under the title of Dade Battlefield Historic Memorial, it is also a United States National Historic Landmark (designated as such on April 14, 1972). History =The Second Seminole War= The United States government negotiated the Treaty of Moultrie Creek in 1824, placing the Seminoles on a reservation that included the site of the future battle. A combination of white settlers moving onto public land in violation of the Treaty of Moultrie Creek, slave hunters trespassing onto the reservation to capture black Seminoles without proof of ownership, and the government's decision to move the Seminoles over the protests of Seminole chiefs infuriated the Seminoles. At around 8:00 AM on the morning of December 28, 1835, the Seminoles, led by Chief Micanopy, ambushed Major Francis L. Dade and 107 men along a segment of the Fort King Road as Dade and his men traveled to Fort King (present-day Ocala, Florida) to reinforce the troops stationed at Fort King. Dade, another commanding officer, and the entire left flank, consisting of one-half of the troops, were killed in the first volley. Over the next six hours, Dade's remaining troops and the Seminoles exchanged gunfire; the gunfire ceased as all but three of Dade's men were killed. Privates Joseph Sprague and Ransom Clarke returned to Fort Brooke (present-day Tampa, Florida); Sprague later served until the end of the Second Seminole War, and Clarke died from his injuries five years later. The Dade Massacre began the Second Seminole War. Ordered by General Thomas Sidney Jesup to build a supply depot, a regiment of Tennessee militiamen led by Major Robert Armstrong, built Fort Armstrong at the site of Dade's Massacre. From Fort Armstrong, Brigadier General Keith Call led an attack on the Seminoles living in the Wahoo Swamp a few days after the fort's construction ended. Later in 1837, Major Thomas Child took over command of the post. During his tenure, one \\"Colonel Dill\\", claiming that he was seeking escaped slaves, was detained and was ordered to return to his residence. Jesup ordered that all government employees and express riders were barred from passing through Fort Armstrong for the purpose of looking for slaves. This was to allow black Seminoles to enter the fort and to be eventually deported to reservations west of the Mississippi River. In 1984, after several years‚Äô work, the Sumter County Historical Society would place a marker at the site of Fort Armstrong. =Early 1900s= Attempts at preserving the Dade massacre site began in 1897 with a bill introduced in the United States Congress which called for the creation of a national park on the Dade massacre battleground and its inclusion in a national park system. Florida congressman Stephen Sparkman began efforts to preserve the Dade Massacre site on January 27, 1904, with the introduction of another bill in the United States House of Representatives seeking to create a national park on the battle's site. In 1907 and again in 1912, Sparkman re-introduced legislation that provided funding for a marker and for the preservation of the battleground. In 1919, United States representative Henry Jackson Drane of Florida, who had visited the Dade Battlefield area in 1884, introduced another bill for the creation of a memorial at the site. =1920s= In 1910, two Florida newspapers, the Leesburg Commercial and the St. Lucie Tribune, encouraged legislators to place a marker on the site of the massacre. At the state level, an attempt to create a memorial park on the site of the Dade Massacre was made in the early 1920s. Before his term in the Florida Legislature, Lake County judge J. C. B. Koonce held pre-trial hearings at the park's site. Fascinated by the battle, Lake County judge Koonce began to develop the area into a park in 1908. In 1921, as the Sumter County representative in the Florida House, Koonce, state senator W. M. Igou of Eustis, state representative L. D. Edge of Groveland, state representative T. G. Futch of Leesburg, and United States Senator Duncan Fletcher urged the Florida legislature to preserve the site. In 1921, the state of Florida appointed Koonce, Fred C. Cubberly (the author of the book The Dade Massacre), and Mrs. A. M. Roland as commissioners of the Dade Memorial Park and authorized them to purchase 80 acres of land at and surrounding the site of the massacre from three local families and a local company for $2,000 (USD). The Florida Legislature also appointed the board to maintain and operate the park. After the passage of the bill, Sumter County residents cleared the land to form the park. During the 1920s, Koonce sculpted statues of the soldiers and Seminoles involved in the battle, ordered a bronze statue to portray Dade, built the gazebo, and constructed the monuments indicating where the officers fell. Koonce and his son O. B. Koonce maintained the landscape. He also pushed to have an archway placed at the entrance to the park, the construction of a road leading to the park in 1926, and electric power lines to connect the park to the power grid. Koonce also constructed other statutes, such as a pelican. In 1922, Representative Drane and Chief Clerk Nathan Hazen of the Ordnance Department arranged to have two guns shipped to the Dade Memorial Park. A portrait of Chief Micanopy hung in the lodge and a statute of Osceola close to the lodge honored the two leaders. =Centennial of the Dade Massacre= In 1935, Koonce promoted the idea to conduct a ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Dade Massacre. To mark the centennial of the Dade Massacre, organizers planned a reenactment of the battle. The Seminoles were to be invited to join and to formally sign a peace treaty with the United States government. Plans eventually changed to include a parade, a barbecue, concerts, addresses by dignitaries, and a full reenactment. On December 28, 1935, over 5,000 people, including Florida's governor attended the ceremony. =World War II= During World War II, Dade Memorial Park served as a United States Army installation. The United States Army Air Corps unit trained personnel in Morse code and radio communications from January 1944 to June 1944. On May 29, 1944, members of the 622nd Signal Aircraft Warning Company were transferred to a base in Ocoee, Florida. The park also served as base housing for soldiers operating at the Bushnell Army Airfield. Tents and a supply room lined the area in front of the breastworks while a mess hall, an office, the motor pool, and a shower room flanked the living quarters. Other buildings were also built in other areas of the park. =1950s= In 1949, the Florida Legislature dissolve the Dade Memorial Park Commission and moved the park under the care of the then Board of Parks and Historical Memorials. Several facilities were built at this time. In 1957, construction on the recreation lodge was completed. The museum opened on July 4, 1957. By 1959, the park had built a children's playground, two tennis courts, a baseball field, courts for shuffleboard and horseshoes, several picnic shelters, and a barbecue shed. In an effort to restore the park to the conditions at the time of the battle, the Division of Natural Resources removed the archway, the monuments, and the statue of the pelican. At a public hearing about the park, the Division of Natural Resources officials faced strong opposition from long- time Sumter County residents who felt that the changes made to the park dishonored Koonce's vision for the park. Residents recovered the discarded monuments and placed them back in the park. When district naturalist John Dodrill realized that the statue portraying Dade was that of a Union soldier, agency officials attempted to raise money to replace the statue. Feeling that the state was dictating the park's design, county residents opposed the measure. In 1983, Dodrill designed a plaque explaining to visitors that the statue represented all fallen Sumter County soldiers. =1960s= About 1968, Sumter County employees found several cylinders measuring 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) long and about three-quarters of an inch (1.90 centimeters) in diameter on the Dade Battlefield Historic Site grounds. Suspecting that the vials were munitions that had been buried on the park grounds during World War II, the workers turned the vials over to a state agency. According to former Sumter County civil defense director Vernon Berry, the agency stated that one vial exploded while the agency was analyzing it. =1970s= On January 22, 1973, Ney Landrum, Chief of the Division of Recreation and Parks, nominated Dade Battlefield to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places. On November 7, 1973, the National Park Service issued national register number 72000353 to Dade Battlefield, listing the park on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1994, the National Park Service listed the park as a National Historic Landmark. To facilitate the study of the park, the National Park Service placed the park under the themes Political and Military Affairs, 1783‚Äì1860‚ÄîJacksonian Democracy, 1828‚Äì1844 and Westward Expansion of the British Colonies and the United States, 1763‚Äì1898‚ÄîMilitary-Aboriginal American Contact and Conflict‚ÄîEast of the Mississippi, 1763‚Äì1850s. In 1976, the state of Florida selected the Dade Battlefield State Historic Site to be a Florida Bicentennial Trail site. To emphasize the park's historical significance, the Division of Recreation and Parks attempted to remove the playground, the baseball field, the tennis courts, and the shuffleboard and horseshoe courts. The south end of the road dividing the park was cut off, making it safe for visitors, and culverts were placed in the ditch that was dug in the park at some time after the battle. In addition, park officials planned to obtain a cannon for the battlefield. As of 2004, one tennis court and two shuffleboard courts remained of the recreational facilities. =1980s= Although members of the Florida Historical Society and several Sumter County veterans organizations sponsored a commemorative day held on December 28, 1966, the first reenactment of Dade's Massacre was held on December 28, 1980, for the battle's 145th anniversary. Dade City historian and Dade Massacre expert Frank Laumer, dressed as Private Ransom Clarke, retold the story of the battle to 300 attendees. Park rangers from Dade Battlefield and Fort Foster, dressed in period uniforms, staged a camp similar to Dade's. The first two-hour-long reenactment since 1935 occurred on December 28, 1985. In 1987, the state constructed a 5-foot (1.5-meter) high and 150-foot (45.7-meter) long berm on the baseball field's outfield to enhance visitors‚Äô view of the reenactment. A Tampa television station aired segments about a commemorative hike led by Laumer from the Hillsborough River to the park from December 27, 1988, to the day of the reenactment on January 1, 1989. A record crowd of 4,500 people attending the reenactment on January 1, 1989, prompted the Dade Battlefield Society to consider the construction of an amphitheater. The Florida Department of Natural Resources granted approval for the amphitheater. For the December 28, 1989, reenactment, the Dade Battlefield Society expanded the event to a two-day event with full reenactments on both Saturday and Sunday. Also on December 29, 1989, an officer's sword belonging to an artillery officer in Dade's command on loan from the Smithsonian Institution arrived at the park. Upon seeing a description of the sword in the magazine Smithsonian, Dr. Ray Giron, a former Santa Fe Community College and Central Florida Community College professor who collects swords, and Laumer contacted the organization. They learned that the sword had been in the Smithsonian's collection since 1880. Giron and Laumer requested that the sword be loaned to the Dade Battlefield museum. The sword was placed on display in a case containing a money belt and a sash that belonged to Lt. William Basinger, one of Dade's officers. =1990s= In 1996, the Dade Battlefield State Historic Site hosted the first annual World War II Commemorative Day. Since the first event, the commemoration has grown to include reenactors representing both the Allies and the Axis, vendors, music, encampments, vehicles, and food. =2000s= Over 70 children and 100 adults from the Seminole Hollywood Youth Conference visited the Dade Battlefield State Historic Site as part of the \\"Looking Back at the Seminole Trail\\" tour on July 8, 2003. Organized by Holly Tiger and Jo Motlow North the trip was a way for Seminole adults and children to visit Seminole battlegrounds as most of them had never visited the sites as children. Although Seminoles had portrayed their ancestors during the annual reenactments, the \\"Looking Back at the Seminole Trail\\" tour was the first time that members of the Seminole Tribe formally visited the park. During the visit, elders Billy Cypress and Bobby Henry and park ranger Chuck Wicks explained both sides of the conflict to the group. The conference members then walked along the trails and visited the museum. In January 2011, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) listed the Dade Battlefield State Historic Site as one of 53 parks that would be closed to the public to reduce the agency's budget by 15% as mandated by the Florida legislature. DEP stated that parks such as the Dade Battlefield State Historic Site were selected for their visitation numbers and their lack of camping facilities. Residents and state Senator Paula Dockery were outraged. To generate interest in the park, members of the Dade Battlefield Society organized events such as a bluegrass festival and an arts and crafts show. In addition, residents organized Friends of Dade Battlefield, a group formed to generate interest in the park. In February 2011, Florida Governor Rick Scott met with DEP officials and expressed his disapproval of the DEP's plan, stating, \\"As you know, we‚Äôve gotten two gold medals for our parks. I think we have 20 million-plus visitors. So, no, we‚Äôve got great parks, and we‚Äôve got to make sure we preserve them and take care of them.\\" In April 2013, the park hosted the first annual Swallow-tailed Kite and Wildlife Festival. Swallow-tailed kites had visited the park, and the Dade Battlefield Society decided to create a festival to educate the public about the birds. The festival's activities included a lecture on swallow-tail kites, kite building and flying, birdhouse construction, and watching the swallow-tailed kites. Facilities and recreational activities Monuments indicating the locations of the officers‚Äô deaths stretch from the park's entrance to about 300 feet (91.44 meters) south. The museum which details the Seminole War lays 49 feet (15 meters) from the replica of the breastworks and about 600 feet (182.88 meters) from the northernmost commemorative monuments. The reenactment takes place in a cleared area in the pine woods about 200 yards (meters) from the site of the actual battle. Activities include picnicking, viewing exhibits at the visitor center, and wildlife viewing. A 3,499-foot (1,066.5-meter) long nature trail winds through the pine flatwoods. In addition, there is a gazebo, a lodge that seats 96 people and has a kitchen, outdoors areas that can be rented for weddings and outdoor events, a tennis court, two shuffleboard courts, six picnic shelters, a barbecue shelter, and restrooms. Several geocaches are hidden in the park. The park is open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays) while the visitor's center is open between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Climate The average low for the month of January is 45.5 ¬∞F (7.5 ¬∞C) while the average high is 70.9 ¬∞F (21.6 ¬∞C). In July, the average high is 91.5 ¬∞F (33.0 ¬∞C) while lows average 70.5 ¬∞F (21.4 ¬∞C). The average precipitation from April 1, 1918, to April 30, 2012, was 50.04 inches (127.10 centimeters). No snow fell during that period. Natural history =Geology= Considered to lie in the Central Highlands, the park is generally flat, with an average elevation of 69 feet (21 meters) above sea level. The lowest point is a dug- out 0.6-acre pit that has been historically used as a vegetation burn pit. The primary rock under the park is limestone. The Florida Crushed Stone Company once considered mining limestone near the park, but they deemed the quality of the limestone to be a commercially poor product. The soil under Dade Battlefield consists of two types of sand: Kanapaha sand and Sparr fine sand. Kanapaha sand is a gray soil that is poorly drained and slowly permeable. It was formed in marine sediments that contained sand and loam. Kanapaha sand supports forest areas. Sparr fine sand is a dark gray sand that occurs in sandy and loamy areas that had been at marine areas. It is poorly drained and slowly permeable. Sparr fine sand supports pine, oak, magnolia, dogwood, and hickory trees. These sands formed from the Middle Eocene to the Holocene period. The city of Bushnell supplies the park's drinking water. The park also has a ditch that connects two ponds, Center Pond, located south of Bushnell, and Webb's Pond (called the \\"Death Pond\\" in records related to the battle), a pond located on private property adjacent to the park. Four bridges throughout the park cross the ditch. Although it normally drains into the swampy areas near the park, water has flowed in the ditch three times before, in 1994, 1995, and 1998, all when heavy rains fell in the area. =Ecology= The area of the battlegrounds was originally pine barrens, a habitat dominated by pines and palmettos. (It is currently known as longleaf pine mesic flatwoods.) Land use made several changes to the land. In 1828, soldiers and slaves constructed the Fort King Road by cutting the understory and pine trees, leaving a 20-foot (6.1-meter) wide road. At the turn of the century, the remaining pine strands were used to produce turpentine and for logging. By 1927, oaks dominated the community. During World War II, pine stumps were removed from the park. In the 1970s, the Florida DEP prescribed controlled burns to prevent the park's pine flatwoods from succeeding into an oak hammock. In the 1950s, officials from the Department of Natural Resources proposed to let the grass and scrub habitat return to its natural state, but residents opposed the measure. In 1976, as a part of the state's Bicentennial Trail preparations, removed several nonnative Florida plants and planted longleaf pines in the park. In 2012, the Sumter County Master GardenerCommunity Beautification Committee designed and replanted several of the park's landscapes in the public areas with native and endemic plants. Forty five acres of the original longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) habitat remain today. Five acres of slash pine (Pinus elliottii) has been planted in the flatwoods. The rare Florida anise or yellow star anise (Illicium parviflorum) has been reported in the park. Among the wildlife of the park are woodpeckers, songbirds, and hawks, and indigo snakes. Several gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) live in the park, and Eastern indigo snakes (Drymarchon corais couperi) have been sighted in the park. Live oaks (Quercus virginiana) cover the rest of the park. Dade Battlefield Society The Dade Battlefield Society is a non-profit organization created to preserve the Dade Battlefield State Historic Site. It was created on June 8, 1987, to raise public awareness of Dade's Massacre. Since the creation of the organization, the Dade Battlefield Society has sponsored the annual reenactment of Dade's massacre. It also has made information about the battle available to the public and has created two videos, a thirty-minute video which details the battle's events and a short film that is shown in the Dade Battlefield Visitors Center. In addition, the Society rebuilt the cement log breastwork and corrected the breastwork's orientation as the breastwork faced west and not east. In 2002, the society purchased a six-pound long barrel cannon similar to the one Dade's men used in the battle. The annual reenactment begins at 2:00 PM on both Saturday and Sunday. An actor portraying Private Ransom Clarke narrates just before the battle starts. The battle begins as the Seminoles, portrayed by Seminoles from the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation, and Dade's men exchange gunfire. After \\"Taps\\", the reenactors rise and talk to the public. During the day, there are demonstrations, lectures, folk music, musket shooting contests, tomahawk throwing contests, and a trade fair. Nearby The city of Bushnell lies to the north and the east of the Dade Battlefield Historic State Park. The town of Wahoo lies six miles (9.6 kilometers) to the west of town. The Wahoo area served as a sheltered area for the Seminoles during the Second Seminole War. The United States Army and the Seminoles fought the Battle of the Withlacoochee River near the town on December 29, 1835. In addition, the army searched the area several times during the Second Seminole War. Today, the town is a populated area within Sumter County, and the battle site is protected by the state of Florida as a part of the Florida Forever Priority List.

It is around north-west of Duns, in the Lammermuir Hills. The Dye Water runs through the village, flowing east towards its confluence with the Whiteadder Water nearby. In the vicinity are traces of an ancient fortification at Runklie or Wrinklaw and the Mutiny Stones cairn. The opera Lucia di Lammermoor, written by Gaetano Donizetti and based on Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor, was set in the Lammermuirs and an old form of the village's name, Lockermachus, is mentioned in Scott's novel. The Southern Upland Way, a Long Distance Route which crosses southern Scotland, passes through the village, and the Sir Walter Scott Way from Moffat to Cockburnspath passes through Longformacus. Etymology Longformacus derives its name from the Gaelic Longphort Mhacais, meaning 'Macas's camp'. Derivation from Lann Fothir Maccus, meaning 'church on the land of Maccus' has also been suggested. History The Mansion House of Longformacus Longformacus Church The church of Longformacus was dedicated by Bishop David de Bernham, 11 March 1243. In 1667 the choir was in ruins, the church itself being \\"very ruinous.\\" It was rebuilt on the old foundations in 1730, and a thorough renovation was made, in 1895. Our Lady's Well is on the Dye Water, about a quarter of a mile east of the village. The parish was long united to Mordington, but was disjoined in 1666.

He was a member of the Durov family of performers who raised the quality and prestige of the Russian circus. Background Anatoly Anatolyevich's great-grandmother, Nadezhda Durova, was the first female officer in the Russian Army, who became a decorated soldier in the Russian cavalry during the Napoleonic wars. His mother, n√©e Tereza Stadler, was a talented circus horse rider of German descent and owned the Bavarian Circus] Long and successful tours led her to make Russia her home. His father, Anatoly Durov, was born to an old noble family and broke with it to join a traveling troupe. Anatoly (Jr.) was a good acrobat, a magician, and a monologue reciter. Anatoly (Sr.) and Vladimir Durov were the first of the Durov clan to gain fame as circus entertainers. Career Anatoly (Jr.) made his circus debut in 1914 in the Nikitin brothers' circus in the city of Ryazan. His real fame came in the years following the Russian Revolution of 1917. The younger Anatoly Durov performed with a large and varied group of animals. His performance commentary was always biting and topical. He toured abroad in 1921. In Serbia he performed in the city of Subotica in the variety show Alhambra; in the city of Zagreb in the Music Hall; in the city of Sarajevo in the Winter Garden. In November 1921, he signed a contract for performances in the cities of Graz and Vienna, Austria with the international circus Orpheus for 500,000 kronor plus travel expenses. In 1922-1923 he toured throughout the Italy, performing in Rome, Milan, Padua (Padova), Genoa (Genova), Bari, Venice, Bologna, Treviso, Adria (Atria), and other places. At the request of Queen Elena of Italy, Anatoly (Jr.) gave a private performance at the royal villa. His performing dog Petit lived in the queen's apartment for three days. Queen Elena granted Anatoly Durov Jun. a golden cigarette-case and a letter of thanks. After his tours across Europe and the United States, Anatoly Durov returned to Soviet Russia and founded an entertainment program that gained international recognition. In 1926 he settled in the city of Taganrog on Shevchenko street 111, where he founded The Taganrog Animal Theater of Anatoly Durov. Anatoly Anatolyevich Durov died in 1928 in a hunting accident near Izhevsk. Anatoly Durov was interred at Taganrog Old Cemetery. His nephews, Vladimir Grigorievich Durov (1909-1972) and Yury Vladimirovich Durov (1909-1971) continued in his footsteps. Both became People's Artists of the USSR. Currently the Durov Theater in Moscow is run by Tereza Durova (b. September 5, 1926), a niece.

It is located on the former Caledonian Railway main line between Glasgow and Perth. It is the junction for the branch line to and Dunfermline via Kincardine and is also served by trains on the Edinburgh to Dunblane Line and long-distance services to Dundee & Aberdeen and to Inverness via the Highland Main Line.  History  Dundee ‚Äì Edinburgh express in 1957 Stirling was first connected to the Scottish Central Railway in 1848. Lines were subsequently opened by the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway in 1853, and by the Forth and Clyde Junction Railway to three years later. Through services to/from the Callander and Oban Railway also served the station from 1870. The current station buildings were opened in 1916 following a major rebuild by the Caledonian Railway. They have undergone several refurbishments (with minor layout changes), the most recent change being the installation of lifts to enable better access to the footbridge linking Platform 2 with Platforms 3 to 8. The line to Balloch lost its passenger services in 1934 and closed as a through route in 1942, although the section from Stirling to Port of Menteith remained open for freight until 1959. The main line from Stirling to Dunfermline was not scheduled for closure under the Beeching Axe, but it was nevertheless closed in 1968. It has since been partly reopened as far as Alloa (see below). Oban services via the C&O; line ended with the Beeching cuts in 1965, and the main terminus in Glasgow for services from Stirling changed from the former C.R. station at to Queen Street the following year. A Motorail service ran between London and Stirling until 1989.  Description  The station building was constructed in 1915 by James Miller, and is listed by Historic Environment Scotland as a Category A listed building. His design continues the circular spaces and flowing curves of his celebrated Wemyss Bay station. In 2008, the travel centre was refurbished to improve disabled access, including power-assisted entrance doors, a wheelchair-accessible counter, and improved customer information systems. In 2009, a shelter was erected on Platforms 9 and 10, and LED display boards replaced the CRT screens, including new displays for Platforms 9 and 10 and the bay Platforms 7 and 8. (Up to c.1988, a large flip-dot display was located above the main concourse; this was removed and the space filled in with a large \\"Welcome to Stirling Station\\" sign.) From December 2009, automated announcements were provided, replacing the manual announcements made from the supervisor's office on Platform 3. In 2013, a new public address system was installed. The station houses a Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) from the British Transport Police. Currently two officers work from Stirling and cover Stirling, , , , , , and . The Stirling Area Command of the Forth Valley Division of Police Scotland cover the territorial area the Stirling NPT cover and will assist when the BTP officers are not available.  Services  Class 170s are used on many services at Stirling The station during electrification works Trains operate north to (three trains per hour), to , and (hourly), (four trains per day), south west to (three trains per hour), and east to Edinburgh Waverley (half- hourly).GB eNRT May 2016 Edition, Tables 229 & 230 The service to Alloa and Dunfermine was withdrawn in October 1968, but the reopening of the Stirling- Alloa-Kincardine rail link partially restored that service with an hourly service from Glasgow to as an extension of the Croy Line services. This utilises the existing DMU from Glasgow, which previously spent considerable time in one of the bay platforms at Stirling with engines idling, but now utilises the layover time to make the return trip to & from Alloa. Most services are operated by Abellio ScotRail; with two trains per day southbound to London Kings Cross and one train per day northbound to Inverness operated by London North Eastern Railway (a second northbound service terminates at Stirling); and one train per day Sunday ‚Äì Friday southbound to London Euston and northbound to Inverness operated by Caledonian Sleeper. The station has nine platforms, though they are ordered 2 to 10. The site of Platform 1 is now occupied by a car park; the platforms were not renumbered. The bay platforms at the north end of the station (Platforms 4 and 5) survive but are not available to passenger trains. The bay platforms at the south end of the station (Platforms 7 and 8) are not normally used for weekday services, but the first services of the day use trains that have been stabled there overnight and they have been fitted with passenger information displays. A major Scottish area timetable recast in 2018 backed by Transport Scotland will see improved journey times from Stirling to both Edinburgh & Glasgow and more frequent services to Gleneagles, Dundee, Perth & Inverness.\\"‚ÄòRail revolution‚Äô means 200 more services and 20,000 more seats for Scots passengers\\" Transport Scotland press release 15 March 2016, Retrieved 18 August 2016 The lines from Glasgow to Alloa & Polmont to Dunblane are also due to be resignalled & electrified by 2018 as part of the rolling modernisation work associated with the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme.

Royal Mudhol Hound  Mudhol has a native breed of hunting dogs called the \\"Mudhol Hounds\\". The breed is known for stamina, sharpness and agility and has international recognition through the Kennel Club of India. This breed of dog is considered to be on the verge of extinction and government agencies are putting all out efforts to save the breed. A postage stamp with a face value of Rs. 5 was released by the Indian Postal Department in recognition of the Mudhol Hound. Shrimant Rajesaheb Malojirao Ghorpade of Mudhol (1884-1937) of the Mudhol State is credited with popularizing the Mudhol Hound. He noticed local tribal people using these hounds for hunting. Using selective breeding, he was able to create the Royal Mudhol Hound. On a visit to England in the early 1900s, the Maharaja (of Mudhol State) presented King George V a pair of Mudhol Hounds, which popularized the Mudhol Hound breed.

The method extends the famous hypernetted-chain method (HNC) introduced by J. M. J van Leeuwen et al. to quantum fluids as well. The classical HNC, together with the Percus‚ÄìYevick approximation, are the two pillars which bear the brunt of most calculations in the theory of interacting classical fluids. Also, HNC and PY have become important in providing basic reference schemes in the theory of fluids, and hence they are of great importance to the physics of many-particle systems. The HNC and PY integral equations provide the pair distribution functions of the particles in a classical fluid, even for very high coupling strengths. The coupling strength is measured by the ratio of the potential energy to the kinetic energy. In a classical fluid, the kinetic energy is proportional to the temperature. In a quantum fluid, the situation is very complicated as one needs to deal with quantum operators, and matrix elements of such operators, which appear in various perturbation methods based on Feynman diagrams. The CHNC method provides an approximate \\"escape\\" from these difficulties, and applies to regimes beyond perturbation theory. In Robert B. Laughlin's famous Nobel Laureate work on the fractional quantum Hall effect, an HNC equation was used within a classical plasma analogy. In the CHNC method, the pair- distributions of the interacting particles are calculated using a mapping which ensures that the quantum mechanically correct non-interacting pair distribution function is recovered when the Coulomb interactions are switched off. The value of the method lies in its ability to calculate the interacting pair distribution functions g(r) at zero and finite temperatures. Comparison of the calculated g(r) with results from Quantum Monte Carlo show remarkable agreement, even for very strongly correlated systems. The interacting pair- distribution functions obtained from CHNC have been used to calculate the exchange-correlation energies, Landau parameters of Fermi liquids and other quantities of interest in many-body physics and density functional theory, as well as in the theory of hot plasmas.

One reviewer called this TV episode \\".. an exciting, well-paced underdog saga\\" Several guest stars take center stage including J. G. Hertzler as Martok, alongside cast regulars Jadzia Dax and Worf. This episode was directed by LeVar Burton, and focusing on Klingon characters including Worf and Martok. Plot The episode opens with Dr. Bashir caring for a badly injured General Martok. Martok then receives a message from the Klingon government stating that he has been assigned to retrieve a missing Klingon vessel, the B'Moth, lost several days ago. The Klingon High Council assigns the General a ship of his own, the Rotarran, to accomplish the mission. He departs Deep Space Nine along with his newly appointed First Officer, Worf who has signed on to the mission at Martok's request. To Worf's surprise Jadzia Dax joins them as the ship's Science Officer. The Rotarran is Martok's first command since his escape from the Dominion prison camp, and he is dismayed to find that the crew are anything but happy; instead, it is an embittered ensemble whose morale has been destroyed by a series of punishing losses at the hands of the Jem'Hadar. The morale situation aboard ship is only made worse by Martok's overcautious nature and unwillingness to go into battle and because of this he misses a chance for an easy victory. Dax, acting as a Klingon would, challenges Worf about the General's behavior which Worf will hear none of. In the mess hall, Dax is forced to stun a Klingon officer with her phaser when a pair of officers get into violent argument, almost causing the death of one of them. After this, Dax angrily confronts Worf about it and tells him that he needs to deal with the General by challenging him for command. The B'Moth, the missing Klingon vessel, is found just across the Cardassian border, but Martok - fearing that the Jem'Hadar left it behind as a trap - refuses to enter Cardassian territory to rescue it. Worf realizes Martok is paralyzed by fear. Reluctantly, he decides to challenge Martok for control of the ship. A knife fight ensues, during which Worf sees that Martok's fear is gone and allows him to win the fight. Worf sustains a nasty wound yet survives, putting Martok into a battle frenzy - just as a Jem'Hadar ship approaches. The revitalized crew defeats the enemy, rescues the B'Moth, and returns to Deep Space Nine as victors for the first time. Martok is forever grateful to Worf for reminding him of his duty as a Klingon warrior, and offers him a place in the House of Martok.

Located south of Wrexham town centre, it comprises a country house built during the 17th and 18th centuries amidst a 1,900 acre estate, which includes a 1,200-acre landscaped pleasure park and the earthworks of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. Erddig is one of the finest stately homes in the United Kingdom. It is particularly celebrated as 'the most evocative Upstairs Downstairs house in Britain' due to the well-rounded view it presents of the lifestyles of all of its occupants, family and staff. The eccentric Yorke family had an unusual relationship with their staff and celebrated their servants in a large and unique collection of portraits and poems. This collection, coupled with well-preserved servants' rooms and an authentic laundry, bake house, sawmill, and smithy, provides an unparalleled view of how 18th to 20th century servants lived. The state rooms contain fine furniture, textiles and wallpapers and the fully restored walled garden is one of the most important surviving 18th century gardens in Britain. In 2003, Erddig was voted by readers of the Radio Times and viewers of the Channel 5 television series Britain's Finest Stately Homes as \\"Britain's second finest\\". In September 2007 it was voted the UK's \\"favourite Historic House\\" and the \\"8th most popular historic site\\" in the UK by Britain's Best. History Pennant's A Tour in Wales, 1778 A print of the 1822 meeting at Erddig of the \\"Royal British Bowmen\\" archery club (1823 print engraved after J. Townshend) Erddig Hall, west front Front of house showing end of walled garden with clock The first recorded reference to Wrexham was in 1161 to a castle at 'Wristlesham'. This castle was probably constructed in what is now the grounds of Erddig. The remains of a Norman motte and bailey, constructed around 1090, can be found in the park of the later mansion. The fortress was built on a steep-sided promontory and the ramparts were adapted from a prehistoric hillfort and incorporate a section of Wat's Dyke. The original house was built on a dramatic escarpment above the winding Clywedog river between 1684‚Äì1689 to the designs of Thomas Webb for Joshua Edisbury of Pentre Clawdd, High Sheriff of Denbighshire. Joshua Edisbury was forced to borrow large sums to fund the project which resulted in his bankruptcy and, in 1716, he was forced to sell Erddig. John Meller, Master of the Chancery, bought the mortgage on Erddig from Sir John Trevor. John Meller refurbished and enlarged the house (including adding two wings in the 1720s). A staunch supporter of the royal house of Hanover, he treated his neighbours with suspicion in what was a strongly Jacobite locality. On his death in 1733, unmarried and childless, he passed it to his nephew, Simon Yorke ( 1767) (first cousin of Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke) thereby establishing an unbroken line of ownership to last for almost 250 years. In 1771, Philip Yorke I began a programme of alterations to the main house including the facing the west front with stone and moving the bedrooms from the ground floor to the first floor. He was the author of the Royal Tribes of Wales and there is a room in Erddig which features the coats of arms of the chief North Wales families. General John Yorke (1814‚Äì1890) was to become from 1861, the owner of the distinctive Plas Newydd in Llangollen, the self-styled home of the famous Ladies of Llangollen. The estate began to decline following the death of Philp Yorke II in 1922 as income diminished and staff were laid off. The house began to decay under his successor, Simon Yorke IV, who became reclusive and failed to install electricity, running water, gas or a phone. Whilst causing damage to the property, this period of neglect ensured that Erddig remained remarkably unaltered. In March 1973, when the last squire Philip Scott Yorke, a bachelor, gave Erddig to the National Trust. This followed the collapse several years earlier of a shaft from the nearby coal mine (Bersham colliery) under the house, causing subsidence of , which seriously affected the structural security of the house to the extent that, without suitable underpinning, it would have become a ruin. It was strengthened using the compensation of ¬£120,000 the National Trust was able to extract from the National Coal Board. of Erddig Park (out of view of the house) was subsequently sold for ¬£995,000 and this paid for the restoration work on the house. The restoration was completed on 27 June 1977 when Charles, Prince of Wales officially opened Erddig to the public, joking that it was the first time in his, albeit short, life that he had opened something that was already 300 years old. = List Of Squires YorkeErddig National Trust Guidebook = ¬∞ Simon Yorke I (1696-1767), cousin of Philip Yorke, 1st Earl Of Hardwicke, maternal nephew of John Mellor ¬∞ Philip Yorke I (1743-1804), son of Simon Yorke I and his wife Dorothy Hutton ¬∞ Simon Yorke II (1771-1834), son of Philip Yorke I and his first wife Elizabeth Cust ¬∞ Simon Yorke III (1811-1894), son of Simon Yorke II and his wife Margaret Holland ¬∞ Philip Yorke II (1849-1922), son of Simon Yorke III and his wife Victoria Cust ¬∞ Simon Yorke IV (1903-1966), son of Philip Yorke II and his second wife Louisa Matilda Scott ¬∞ Philip Yorke III (1905-1978), brother of Simon Yorke IV One of the main streets of Wrexham town Centre, Yorke Street, is named after the family and the Squire Yorke public house in the town is named after Philip Yorke III. Tour of the mansion house Erddig, front of house A tour of the house, which starts \\"below stairs\\", tells of the Yorke family's unusually high regard for their servants and, through a collection of portraits, photographs and verses (a family tradition started by Simon's son Philip Yorke (1743‚Äì1804), provides a record of the people who lived and worked on the estate. In the staterooms \\"above stairs\\" there is a fine collection of 18th century furniture and other treasures (many of which originally belonged to John Meller, including a portrait in the Music Room of Judge Jeffreys, the \\"Hanging Judge\\"). The Yorke family seemingly never threw anything away and the house now has a unique collection ranging from the rare and magnificent (including some exquisite Chinese wallpaper in the State Bedroom) to the ordinary and everyday: indeed, one of the conditions that the last Squire, Philip S. Yorke (1905‚Äì1978) imposed on handing over the house and estate to the National Trust in 1973 was that nothing was to be removed from the house. He is quoted as saying: \\"My only interest for many years has been that this unique establishment for which my family have foregone many luxuries and comforts over seven generations should now be dedicated to the enjoyment of all those who may come here and see a part of our national heritage preserved for all foreseeable time.\\" Gardens View in grounds of Erddig, 1794 Stansty Park, moved to Erddig in 1908 Erddig's walled garden is one of the most important surviving 18th century formal gardens in Britain. The gardens contain rare fruit trees, a canal, a pond, a Victorian era parterre, and are home to an NCCPG National Plant Collection of Hedera (ivy). There is also a fine example of gates and railings made by ironsmiths the Davies brothers, of nearby Bersham, for Stansty Park; the gates were moved to Erddig in 1908. The arrangement of alcoves in the yew hedges in the formal gardens may be a form of bee bole. The 486-hectare (1,200-acre) landscape pleasure park was designed by William Emes. Emes' landscaping work involved the removal of a section of Wat's Dyke near the house. In 2018 this was excavated by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust who found that most of the ditch and some of the bank of this linear earthwork survived intact. Erddig's 'Cup and Saucer' Estate buildings The estate buildings include the joiners' shop and smithy, the Midden Yard (with its saw mill and cart sheds), and the Stable Yard (with its stables and tack room, carriages and vintage bicycles and vintage cars). In the house are the laundry, bakehouse, kitchen and scullery. The nearby river supplied a source of water, which was pumped uphill by a hydraulic ram, the water entering the ram via a feature known as Erddig's Cup and Saucer. Whilst occupied by the Yorke family the house was never installed with mains electricity, with the last Squire, Philip, relying on a portable generator to power his single television set. The saw mill, however, was equipped with its own static steam engine to provide the power for sawing and turning.

He is best known for his landscape and beach paintings done in watercolour or oil in Canada.  Biography  William Nichol Cresswell was born in Shoreditch, London. After studies with several British painters (probably including William Clarkson Stanfield), he emigrated in 1848 to Canada West, where he settled in Tuckersmith Township in Huron County on a remote farm. Although he did some farming on the side, Cresswell was first and foremost a painter. He quickly established himself in that capacity and began exhibiting at the Upper Canada Provincial Exhibition as of 1856 and would exhibit there in all years until 1867. In 1866, he married Elizabeth R. Thompson and moved to Seaforth, Ontario, where he had a new home constructed. Cresswell travelled extensively in Canada: to Georgian Bay in 1865, through Qu√©bec and New Hampshire in 1866, to Lake Nipigon in northern Ontario in 1876, and in the 1880s he visited the Maritimes and spent some time on the Gasp√© Peninsula, and travelled to Grand Manan in New Brunswick. Cresswell continued to show his work at various exhibitions in Upper Canada and also in London, where he won a medal at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in 1886. In 1874 already he had been elected a member of the Ontario Society of Artists, and in 1880, he was a founding member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. In 1887, he fled the cold climate to southern California, where he spent the winter. He even planned to move there permanently, but died the next summer in his home at Seaforth before consolidating these plans.  Work and influences  The last of the brig, watercolour painting from 1880. Cresswell's paintings are mostly landscape scenes in rural or even wilderness settings, animal scenes, or maritime topics showing primarily coastal scenes from the Atlantic. Especially in the latter, the influence of Stanfield--himself a noted painter of maritime scenery--has been noted by Harper. In Canada, Cresswell began teaching the young Robert Ford Gagen in 1863, and thirteen years later also the then sixteen years old George Agnew Reid.

Description and reproduction Fucus serratus is a robust alga, olive-brown in colour and similar to Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus spiralis. It grows from a discoid holdfast up to long. The fronds are flat, about wide, bifurcating, and up to long including a short stipe. It branches irregularly and dichotomously. The flattened blade has a distinct midrib and is readily distinguished from related taxa by the serrated edge of the fronds. It does not have air vesicles, such as are found in F. vesiculosus, nor is it spirally twisted like F. spiralis. Male and female receptacles are on different plants. The lamina shows cryptostomata ‚Äì small cavities which produce colourless hairs. The reproductive bodies form in conceptacles sunken in receptacles towards the tips on the branches. In these conceptacles oogonia and antheridia are produced and after meiosis the oogonia and antheridia are released. Fertilisation follows and the zygote develops, settles and grows directly into the diploid sporophyte plant. Distribution Fucus serratus is found along the Atlantic coast of Europe from Svalbard to Portugal, in the Canary Islands and on the shores of north-east America. It was introduced to Iceland and the Faroe Islands by humans within the last 1000 years where it was first noted in a phycological survey in 1900. Ecology Fucus serratus grows very well on slow draining shores where it may occupy up to a third of the area of the entire seashore. It often dominates the rocky parts of the lower shore, exposed or immersed in rock pools, on all but the most exposed shores. \\"‚Ä¶the littoral zone is characterised especially by such Phaeophyta (brown algae) as Pelvetia, Ascophyllum, Egregia, Fucus and Laminaria, particularly when the shore is rocky\\".

Men's liberation activists are generally sympathetic to feminist standpoints and have been greatly concerned with deconstructing negative aspects of male identity and portions of masculinity which do not serve to promote the stories and lives of all men. The men's liberation movement is not to be confused with different movements such as the men's rights movement in which some argue that modern feminism has gone too far and additional attention should be placed on men's rights. The men's liberation movement stresses the costs of some negative portions of \\"traditional\\" masculinity, whereas the men's rights movement is largely about unequal or unfair treatment of men by modern institutions because of, or in spite of those traits ubiquitous to traditional masculinity. The men's liberation movement also aims to liberate men from stereotypes and their attitudes that prevent them from expressing their emotions.APA Dictionary of Psychology  History  Men in the early portions of the 20th century started to use the battle for worker's rights as a way of examining their own lives as men in a capitalist society. This can be observed as writers like Upton Sinclair exposed the horrendous conditions men worked under in meat packing plants. Unskilled immigrant men did the backbreaking and often dangerous work, laboring in dark and unventilated rooms, hot in summer and unheated in winter. Many stood all day on floors covered with blood, meat scraps, and foul water, wielding sledge-hammers and knives. The extent to which the growth of capital outpaces wages can and does force men to work in dangerous conditions and for others' betterment is often viewed through the lens of Marxism. Thus, it is somewhat difficult to differentiate between men's liberation, men's rights, and labor rights. The rights of labor are often synonymous with the rights of men. This can also be examined politically in the 1791 treatise The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine. In this work, Paine suggests \\"The mutual dependence and reciprocal interest which man has upon man, and all the parts of civilised community upon each other, create that great chain of connection which holds it together. The landholder, the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant, the tradesman, and every occupation, prospers by the aid which each receives from the other, and from the whole. Common interest regulates their concerns, and forms their law; and the laws which common usage ordains, have a greater influence than the laws of government. In fine society performs for itself almost everything which is ascribed to government.\\" In as much as Sinclair and Marx were attempting to empower working men from their capital holding brethren ‚Äî Paine is shown to be examining the rights of man to be a worker of his own sort, free from a government which does not exist to his betterment. The men's liberation movement, as recognized by feminists and today's gender scholars who are often ignorant and even hostile towards Marxist critique, developed mostly among heterosexual, middle-class men in Britain and North America as a response to the cultural changes of the 1960s and 1970s, including the growth of the feminist movement, counterculture, women's and gay liberation movements, and the sexual revolution. Jack Sawyer published an article titled \\"On Male Liberation\\" in Liberation journal in the autumn of 1970, in which he discussed the negative effects of stereotypes of male sex roles. 1971 saw the birth of men's discussion groups across the United States, as well as the formation by Warren Farrell of the National Task Force on the Masculine Mystique within the National Organization for Women. Robert Lewis and Joseph Pleck sourced the birth of the movement to the publication of five books on the subject in late 1974 and early 1975, which was followed by a surge of publications targeted to both lay and more academic audiences. The movement led to the formation of conferences, consciousness raising groups, men's centers, and other resources across the United States. The male liberation movement as a single self-conscious liberal feminist movement dissolved during the late 1970s. By the early 1980s, members of the male liberation movement had fully split into two entities. The members who had placed greater emphasis on the 'cost of male gender roles to men' than the 'cost of male gender roles to women' had formed the men's rights movement focusing on issues faced by men. The members who saw sexism exclusively as a system of men oppressing women rejected the language of sex roles and created pro-feminist men's organizations focused primarily on addressing sexual violence against women.  Race  Racial differences have historically stratified the men‚Äôs liberation movement and such divisions still remain problematic today. Some profeminist scholars argueHoch, Paul. \\"White Hero, Black Beast: Racism, Sexism, and the Mask of Masculinity\\", reprinted in Feminism & Masculinities, Peter F. Murphy, ed. ([1970]; Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 93‚Äì107.Messner, Michael. \\"Politics of Masculinities: Men in Movements\\". Oxford: AltaMira Press, 2000, pp. 4‚Äì5. that racism within American society has emasculated non-white men. For example, black men are perceived to lack control over their innate sexual aggression. Within this ideological framework black men are presented as hyper-sexual to an animalistic degree; they therefore represent beasts, not men. East Asian Americans, however, have been portrayed as unattractive and less masculine.  Gay liberation  Second-wave pro-feminism paid increased attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and hegemonic masculinity. This shift led to more cooperation between the men's liberation and gay liberation movements. In part this cooperation arose because masculinity was then understood to be a social construction, and as a response to the universalization of \\"men\\" seen in previous men's movements.  Organizations  = California Men's Gatherings = The California Men's Gatherings (CMG) was created in 1978 by men in the anti-sexist men's movement. Author Margo Adair, who attended the twelfth gathering in 1987, wrote that she found the atmosphere strangely different than anything she had previously experienced. After thinking about it, she realized it was the first time she had ever felt completely safe among a large group of men, with few other women. She also noticed that everyone was accepted, and affection among participants was displayed openly. CMG organizes three retreats annually, focused on men's issues. Currently, most of the men attending California Men's Gatherings are gay or bisexual. = Radical Faeries = The Radical Faeries were organized in California in 1979 by gay activists wanting to create an alternative to being assimilated into mainstream men's culture. = National Organization for Men Against Sexism = The National Organization for Men Against Sexism (NOMAS) is a pro-feminist, gay affirmative men's organization which also enhances men's lives that began in the 1970s.

Born in Breslau, Germany and raised in East Germany, where she earned a masters degree in engineering, in 1960, she and her family moved to Stuttgart in West Germany. In 1961, she entered the state pageant of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in the hope of winning the car that was offered as prize. From there, she went on to represent her state in the national pageant in Baden-Baden, where she was crowned Miss Germany 1961. She then went on to win the Miss Universe pageant against 47 other participants. She was at that time the tenth consecutive German entrant to reach the semifinals of the event (then a record) and is the first (and to date only) German to be crowned Miss Universe. In 1962, Schmidt became the third of eight wives of the American actor Ty Hardin. They settled in the United States. The marriage lasted until 1966. They had one daughter, Schmidt's only child. From 1972 to 1986, Schmidt was involved in the movie industry, where she acquired credits as actress, producer and writer in eleven productions. None of the films achieved particular merit for plot or other production values apart from generally offering a liberal dose of female nudity, albeit the 1972 skin-fest The Stepmother distinguished itself by receiving an Oscar nomination for its musical score.

The joystick had two DE-9 connectors. The primary connector was Atari compatible, with a shorter grey cable and connector attached to this. The secondary connector is compatible with the non-standard Amstrad built ZX Spectrum computers; the Sinclair Interface II and other popular ZX Spectrum joystick interfaces were Atari compatible.

Lederer established a stand-up act at the Comedy Store in London and then won minor parts in episodes of The Young Ones, which had been written by her Comedy Store contemporaries Ben Elton and Rik Mayall. She would be linked with this scene for the rest of the 1980s, with a supporting role as housemaid Flossie in Happy Families and numerous appearances in related shows and live performances. Lederer broke from the Comedy Store wing of the alternative scene in 1986 to take part in the BBC2 sketch show Naked Video, which had originated without Lederer on the radio in Scotland. Lederer played various roles, including that of a newsreader linking spoof headlines into clips which acted as punchlines, and a drunk Sloane who performed a monologue in each episode from a wine bar. In the 1980s she reprised her Sloane role in a series of television adverts for Warninks Advocaat, with voice-overs by Stephen Fry. In the 1990s, Lederer was recruited by her old contemporaries Mayall and Adrian Edmondson to play supporting roles in two episodes of their sitcom Bottom, including a memorable part as a fallen millionairess on the make.

Biography Souris was born in Marchienne-au-Pont, Belgium, and studied at the Conservatory in Brussels from 1911 to 1918, winning first prizes in music history (1915), harmony (1916), counterpoint and fugue (1917), and the violin (1918). Following postgraduate studies in composition and orchestration with Gilson, he won the Rubens prize in 1927. This enabled him to move to Paris, where he sought out the leaders of the avant garde. He took conducting lessons with Scherchen in 1935, and was a conductor for the Belgian radio from 1937 to 1946 . Up until 1923 Souris composed a great deal of music under the strong influence of Claude Debussy, but after discovering other musical styles at the Pro Arte Concerts, he repudiated these early works and adopted Erik Satie and Igor Stravinsky as his models. Joining the Belgian surrealists of the group Correspondance around Paul Noug√©, he wrote deliberately banal music, beginning with the Choral, marche et galop for four brass instruments (1925), which became his op. 1‚Äîa work clearly indebted to L'Histoire du soldat (Vanhulst 2001). He lived in Italy, France, and Austria, and died in Paris .

Established in 1965, the Academy serves as the profession‚Äôs voice on public policy and professionalism issues. Standards The Academy, in 1988, created the Actuarial Standards Board (ASB) as an independent entity, supported by AAA staff. The ASB serves as the single board promulgating standards of practice for the entire actuarial profession in the United States. The ASB was given sole authority to develop, obtain comment upon, revise, and adopt standards of practice for the actuarial profession. Membership requirements In order to sign statements of actuarial opinion, an American actuary must be a Member, American Academy of Actuaries (M.A.A.A.). The Academy membership requirements are: *Membership in one of the following societies: **Associate or Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society. **Associate or Fellow of the Society of Actuaries. **M.S.P.A. or F.S.P.A. in the American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries. **Conference of Consulting Actuaries. **Enrolled Actuary status under Title 3, Section C of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. **Fellowship in the Canadian Institute of Actuaries. **Fellowship in the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland. **Fellowship in the Institute of Actuaries in Great Britain. **Membership in the Colegio Nacional de Actuarios in Mexico. **Fellowship in the Institute of Actuaries of Australia. **Special approval by the Membership Committee and the Executive Committee of other actuarial educational credentials. *A resident of the United States for at least three years, or a non-resident or new resident who meets the Academy's education requirements and can prove familiarity with U.S. laws and practices in his or her ‚Äúactuarial practice area.‚Äù Actuarial Board for Counseling and Discipline  The Actuarial Board for Counseling and Discipline (ABCD) was formed to serve the academy and all other U.S. actuarial organizations.

In addition, the ABCD responds to inquiries by actuaries concerning their professional conduct and, when requested to do so, provides guidance in professional matters.  Public policy activities  The Academy has published a number of issue briefs and monographs addressing public policy issues from an actuarial point of view. Because the Academy is non-partisan, it avoids taking specific policy positions in these publications. Most tend to discuss the fiscal and economic considerations as seen by actuaries. In many cases several policy alternatives are discussed, and advantages and disadvantages identified for each. In some cases the Academy provides formal written or oral testimony to Congress or other governmental bodies. The Academy is often asked by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to provide input on actuarial issues, and has provided the NAIC with a number of reports and statements. On occasion, the Academy has submitted amicus briefs on court cases that are of interest to the actuarial profession. Less formal comment letters and other explanatory materials have been provided to a number of external audiences.  Magazine  The Academy publishes Contingencies magazine, a bimonthly publication that publishes articles on a wide range of issues related to the actuarial profession.

Thielemann is a regular conductor at the Bayreuth Festival, following his d√©but in 2000 with Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, and at the Salzburg Festival. With the decision in September 2008 of the Richard Wagner Festival Foundation to appoint Katharina Wagner and Eva Wagner-Pasquier to succeed Wolfgang Wagner as directors of the Bayreuth Festival, Thielemann was named Musical Advisor. In June 2015, the Bayreuth Festival formally announced the appointment of Thielemann as its music director. Thielemann attracted controversy after attribution of anti-semitic remarks to him in 2000, regarding Daniel Barenboim, which Thielemann subsequently denied.\\"A comment from Bayreuth on Barenboim's surprise\\" by Dalia Shehori, Haaretz (15 August 2001) Other controversy has related to Thielemann's publication of opinions in sympathy with the Pegida movement. In 2003, Thielemann was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesverdienstkreuz). In October 2011, he received honorary membership of the Royal Academy of Music in London. In 2015, Thielemann won the Richard Wagner Award (Richard-Wagner-Preis) of Leipzig.Richard Wagner Award for conductor Thielemann, News Directory, March 4, 2015. He served in the Humanitas Programme as Visiting Professor in Opera Studies at Oxford University in January 2016. He conducted the Vienna Philharmonic 2019 New Year's Concert for the very first time.

The school had 926 pupils on roll in 2017.  History  The school was founded in 1988 as the first Welsh- medium school in the former Gwent LEA area and is housed in accommodation previously used for Trevethin Comprehensive School. For its first three years Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw was housed in the old Abercarn Infant School house but soon outgrew the building. As one of the fastest growing schools in Wales, bigger premises were needed and the old Trevethin upper school was suggested by the education authority. Pupils at the school are taught completely in Welsh and come from a range of Welsh-language feeder schools. The aim is to immerse pupils in Welsh and to enable them to be educated entirely in it as their native language. As of 2016, the number of new pupils each year has been falling due to the opening of a new Welsh comprehensive school in Newport. An inspection report by Estyn in 2008 stated 94.5% of the pupils came from homes where English is the main language; 5.3% came from Welsh-speaking homes. The same report also says that all pupils speak Welsh as a first language or to an equivalent standard.2008 Estyn report in Welsh and English However, this was some time ago and much can change in eleven years. The 2019 Estyn inspection resulted in the school being placed into special measures. This is evidence of the school's steady decline in standards over the course of multiple inspections now.https://www.estyn.gov.wales/sites/www.estyn.gov.wales/files/documents/Ysgol%20Gyfun%20Gwynllyw%20en.pdf In 2009 the school was given a grant to make improvements and replace the old static cabins with a new and improved complex building. Construction was completed in 2012. In 2018 the school was given ¬£3 million to develop a primary school, and in 2020 the work began on construction, beginning with the demolition of the three remaining static cabins on the site of the future primary school.

The phenomenon is named for the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of coffee. It is also commonly seen after spilling red wine. The mechanism behind the formation of these and similar rings is known as the coffee ring effect or in some instances, the coffee stain effect, or simply ring stain. Flow mechanism The coffee-ring pattern originates from the capillary flow induced by the differential evaporation rates across the drop: liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge. As a function of time, this process exhibit a \\"rush-hour\\" effect, that is, a rapid acceleration of the edgeward flow at the final stage of the drying process. Evaporation induces a Marangoni flow inside a droplet. The flow, if strong, redistributes particles back to the center of the droplet. Thus, for particles to accumulate at the edges, the liquid must have a weak Marangoni flow, or something must occur to disrupt the flow. For example, surfactants can be added to reduce the liquid's surface tension gradient, disrupting the induced flow. Water has a weak Marangoni flow to begin with, which is then reduced significantly by natural surfactants. Interaction of the particles suspended in a droplet with the free surface of the droplet is important in creating a coffee ring. \\"When the drop evaporates, the free surface collapses and traps the suspended particles .. eventually all the particles are captured by the free surface and stay there for the rest of their trip towards the edge of the drop.\\"Coffee-ring phenomenon explained in new theory. phys.org (December 20, 2016) This result means that surfactants can be used to manipulate the motion of the solute particles by changing the surface tension of the drop, rather than trying to control the bulk flow inside the drop. Suppression Stains produced by colloidal mixtures of polystyrene particles (diameter 1.4 ¬µm) and cellulose fibers (diameter ca. 20 nm, length ca. 1 ¬µm). The polystyrene concentration is fixed at 0.1 wt%, and that of cellulose is 0 (left), 0.01 (center) and 0.1 wt% (right). The coffee- ring pattern is detrimental when uniform application of a dried deposit is required, such as in printed electronics. It can be suppressed by adding elongated particles, such as cellulose fibers, to the spherical particles that cause the coffee-ring effect. The size and weight fraction of added particles may be smaller than those of the primary ones. It is also reported that controlling flow inside a droplet is a powerful way to generate uniform film; for example, by harnessing solutal Marangoni flows occurring during evaporation. Gen√ßer, A.; Sch√ºtz, C.; Thielemans, W., Influence of the Particle Concentration and Marangoni Flow on the Formation of Cellulose Nanocrystal Films. Langmuir 2017, 33 (1), 228-234 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b03724 Mixtures of low boiling point and high boiling point solvents were shown to suppress the coffee ring effect, changing the shape of a deposited solute from a ring-like to a dot-like shape. Control of the substrate temperature was shown to be an effective way to suppress the coffee ring formed by droplets of water-based PEDOT:PSS solution. On a heated hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrate, a thinner ring with an inner deposit forms, which is attributed to Marangoni convection.Patil N. D., Bange P. G., Bhardwaj R., Sharma A, Effects of Substrate Heating and Wettability on Evaporation Dynamics and Deposition Patterns for a Sessile Water Droplet Containing Colloidal Particles Langmuir, Vol. 32 (45), Pages 11958‚Äì11972, 2016 DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b02769 Control of the substrate wetting properties on slippery surfaces can prevent the pinning of the drop contact line, which will, therefore, suppress the coffee ring effect by reducing the number of particles deposited at the contact line. Drops on superhydrophobic or liquid impregnated surfaces are less likely to have a pinned contact line and will suppress ring formation. Drops with an oil ring formed at the drop contact line have high mobility and can avoid the ring formation on hydrophobic surfaces. Alternating voltage electrowetting may suppress coffee stains without the need to add surface- active materials. Reverse particle motion may also reduce the coffee-ring effect because of the capillary force near the contact line. The reversal takes place when the capillary force prevails over the outward coffee-ring flow by the geometric constraints. Determinants of size and pattern The lower-limit size of a coffee ring depends on the time scale competition between the liquid evaporation and the movement of suspended particles. When the liquid evaporates much faster than the particle movement near a three- phase contact line, coffee ring cannot be formed successfully. Instead, these particles will disperse uniformly on a surface upon complete liquid evaporation. For suspended particles of size 100 nm, the minimum diameter of the coffee ring structure is found to be 10 Œºm, or about 10 times smaller than the width of human hair. The shape of particles in the liquid is responsible for coffee ring effect. On porous substrates, the competition among infiltration, particle motion and evaporation of the solvent governs the final deposition morphology. The pH of the solution of the drop influences the final deposit pattern. The transition between these patterns is explained by considering how DLVO interactions such as the electrostatic and Van der Waals forces modify the particle deposition process. Applications The coffee ring effect is utilized in convective deposition by researchers wanting to order particles on a substrate using capillary-driven assembly, replacing a stationary droplet with an advancing meniscus drawn across the substrate. This process differs from dip-coating in that evaporation drives flow along the substrate as opposed to gravity. Convective deposition can control particle orientation, resulting in the formation of crystalline monolayer films from nonspherical particles such as hemispherical, dimer, and dumbbell shaped particles. Orientation is afforded by the system trying to reach a state of maximum packing of the particles in the thin meniscus layer over which evaporation occurs. They showed that tuning the volume fraction of particles in solution will control the specific location along the varying meniscus thickness at which assembly occurs. Particles will align with their long axis in- or out-of-plane depending on whether or not their longer dimension of the particle was equal to the thickness of the wetting layer at the meniscus location. Such thickness transitions were established with spherical particles as well. It was later shown that convective assembly could control particle orientation in assembling multi-layers, resulting in long-range 3D colloidal crystals from dumbbell shaped particles. These finds were attractive for the self-assembled of colloidal crystal films for applications such as photonics. Recent advances have increased the application of coffee-ring assembly from colloidal particles to organized patterns of inorganic crystals.

She was nominated for the 2006 BBC World Music Awards. Her debut album Salt Rain was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2001. She is known for energetic, vibrant, syncretic, and uplifting live performances built on the sacred Bhakti and Sufi traditions of India and Pakistan. Biography =Early years= Susheela Raman's parents are Tamils from Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, India, who arrived in London, UK in the mid-sixties. At the age of four, Raman and her family left the UK for Australia. Susheela grew up singing South Indian classical music and began giving recitals at an early age. She recalls how her family \\"were eager to keep our Tamil culture alive.\\" As a teenager in Sydney she started her own band, describing its sound as \\"funk and rock and roll\\", before branching out into more blues and jazz-based music, which demanded quite different voice techniques. She tried to bring these streams together when in 1995 she travelled to India to rediscover her roots by way of further exploring Carnatic music. =Music career= Returning to England in 1997, she started to work with her partner, guitarist/producer Sam Mills who had recorded \\"Real Sugar\\" with a Bengali singer named Paban Das Baul. According to Raman \\"it bridged a gap and found common ground for one particular kind of Indian music to be expressed to a new audience.\\" In 1999, Raman co-wrote songs for the album One and One is One by Joi, also performing on the track \\"Asian Vibes.\\" Mills had worked with West African musicians in the group Tama which also opened musical contact points within the Parisian music scene. =Salt Rain= After a period of three years collaborating with Sam Mills, Raman released her first album Salt Rain in 2001 on Narada, an American subsidiary of EMI. The album went gold in France and in the UK was shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize. Raman also won the Best Newcomer award from BBC Radio 3. Salt Rain drew on traditional Tamil music blended with jazz-folk and pop influences. It featured original material, as well as old songs Raman sang at recitals when younger. =Love Trap= In 2003 Raman released her second album Love Trap which featured amongst other collaborators the Nigerian drummer Tony Allen and Tuvan singer Albert Kuvezin of the group Yat-Kha. The title track is a re- interpretation of an Ethiopian song by Mahmoud Ahmed. Raman performing in 2007 =Music for Crocodiles= Music for Crocodiles, Raman's third album, was released in 2005. It had been partly recorded in Chennai (Madras), India. The album included \\"The Same Song\\" which was used by Mira Nair for the end credits of her film The Namesake. (Nair also used Raman's version of the 1960s Hindi film song \\"Ye Mera Divanapan Hai\\" from the previous album). On Music for Crocodiles Raman sang for the first time in French on \\"L'Ame Volatile\\". Raman's training in Carnatic classical music makes its presence felt in Tamil classical titles such as \\"Sharavana,\\" her singing \\"Meanwhile\\" (on the same album) in a rƒÅgam called Kanakaangi, and in the song \\"Light Years\\" which features a melody in Kalyani rƒÅgam as well as the veena playing of Punya 'Devi' Srinivas. In 2006 Susheela was again nominated for a BBC World Music Award and was the subject of a one-hour documentary by French-German TV Channel Arte, called Indian Journey directed by Mark Kidel. =33= Susheela's deal with Narada ended in 2006 and that year she independently recorded an album 33, a set of re-imaginings of tracks from the nineteen sixties and seventies. Artists covered include Bob Dylan, John Lennon, The Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart, Jimi Hendrix, Can and Throbbing Gristle. The album features long term collaborators Sam Mills on guitar, Vincent Segal on cello, and tabla player and percussionist Aref Durvesh. The album was released in April 2007 in France on the independent label XIII Bis. =2008 to 2010= Raman garnered acclaim for her live performances. She continued to research and discover music from Tamil Nadu, studying in 2007 with the Bhakti singer Kovai Kamla. =Vel= In 2011, Raman released Vel, marking a change in musical direction which was well received. She followed this up with a series of concerts which showcased her new musical direction, demonstrating, as her reviewers put it \\"a rousing comeback\\". =2011 to 2013= Concert in Brittany (France) in July 2014 Through 2011 to 2013, Raman worked with Sufi Qawali singers and musicians in Lahore in addition to Rajasthani musicians, and continued to explore ecstatic and devotional musical styles. In 2013, Raman returned to the stage in London at the Royal Festival Hall as part of the Alchemy Festival, having previously played at the Jaipur Literary Festival. =Queen Between= In September 2013 Susheela Raman announced a new album, as yet untitled, inviting pledges from fans to ensure its release in spring 2014. Of this she said: \\"The record I am making now reflects my work in recent years living in London but travelling to work with master musicians from India and Pakistan. It features master musicians from Rajasthan, and spectacular Sufi Qawwali singers from Pakistan. In addition to my longstanding companions guitarist/producer Sam Mills and tabla demon Aref Durvesh, Fela Kuti‚Äôs legendary drummer Tony Allen and French cellist Vincent Segal also make an appearance. It is a really exciting album with singing in English, Tamil, Panjabi, Urdu, Marwari and Bengali. It has some amazing playing and guest vocals by Kutle Khan and Rizwan Muazzam. It‚Äôs a big, beautiful, ambitious, groundbreaking album and ... it‚Äôs all about the songs. It‚Äôs a work in progress and a strong start has been made. While the Qawals and Rajasthanis were in London this April we had some great sessions and laid down the basic recording for about nine tracks so far and now are looking for funding to complete the recording and editing, to mix, master and then to promote the album.\\" The album was finally released on 1 March 2014 as Queen Between.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cited \\"Fighting for the Press\\" in its decision May 7, 2015, limiting the controversial National Security Agency (NSA) domestic phone monitoring program.A.C.L.U. v. Clapper (2015 WL 2097814 (C.A.2 (N.Y.))) He represented the Times in four of its United States Supreme Court cases, including Branzburg v. Hayes in which the Times intervened on behalf of its reporter Earl Caldwell. The other cases were New York Times v. Sullivan, New York Times Co. v. United States (the Pentagon Papers case), and New York Times Co. v. Tasini. He was the leading force behind the Times' decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971. After the Times' outside counsel, Lord Day & Lord, advised the Times against publishing classified information and quit when the United States Justice Department threatened to sue the paper to stop publication, Goodale led his own legal team and directed the strategy that resulted in winning the Supreme Court case of New York Times Co. v. United States. He has been called \\"the father of the reporter's privilege\\" because of his interpretation of the Branzburg case in the Hastings Law Journal. This led to the establishment of a reporter's privilege to protect sources in most states and federal circuits. Goodale created the specialty of First Amendment law among commercial lawyers. From 1972-2007 he established and chaired an annual Communications Law Seminar at the Practising Law Institute. This led to the creation of a First Amendment Bar. He continues to serve as the seminar's chairman emeritus. After he left The New York Times in 1980, he joined the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP in New York City. there he founded a corporate group and a litigation group dealing with media, communications, and the First Amendment. These groups have represented many well-known U.S. communication entities including the New York Times, CBS, and NBC. He served as chairman of the board for the Committee to Protect Journalists from 1989 - 1994. During his tenure he built CPJ into a significant international force, instrumental in the release of imprisoned journalists around the globe. From 1995-2010 he produced and hosted over 300 programs for Digital Age on WNYE-TV, a TV show about the effect of the internet on media and society. Since 1977 he has taught First Amendment and Communications law at Yale, New York University and Fordham law schools and has authored over 200 articles in publications such as The New York Times, The New York Review of Books, and the Stanford Law Review. Columbia Journalism Review has listed James Goodale as one of 200 who shaped New York Media. He was named by Time magazine in 1974 as one of the rising leaders in the United States. Goodale was the recipient of the \\"Champion of the First Amendment Award,\\" from the American Bar Association Forum in February 2014. On May 5, 2015, PEN America awarded the 2015 PEN/Toni and James C. Goodale Freedom of Expression Courage Award to the French satirical weekly, Charlie Hebdo. Many of that magazines' editors had been killed in a homegrown jihadist terrorist attack. The award caused an international controversy as to whether it should have been given to Charlie Hebdo. Over 200 writers signed a protest against the award and many withdrew from the PEN dinner at which the award was given. In reply to attack on the award given by him and his wife, Goodale said, \\"the award is not for what is said. It's for the right to say it. In this case, journalists got killed for what they said. They should be honored, and my wife and I are extremely proud to do that.\\" Education and early career Goodale was born July 27, 1933 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His mother, a college professor, was the daughter of the Shakespearean scholar Oscar James Campbell Jr., who wrote The Readers Encyclopedia of Shakespeare. Goodale graduated from the Pomfret School and Yale University in 1955, which he attended on the William Brinckerhoff Jackson Scholarship and was a member of Elihu. At Yale, he played on the baseball and hockey teams. He received his Juris Doctorate from the University of Chicago Law School in 1958, which he attended on a National Honor Scholarship. From 1959 to 1963, he worked for the Wall Street law firm of Lord Day & Lord. That firm was also the long time outside counsel of The New York Times. During this time, he also served for six years in the Army Reserve as a strategic and intelligence research analyst, which influenced his views on overclassification and convinced him it was not a crime to publish classified information. New York Times At age 29, Goodale set up the legal department at The New York Times and subsequently became its first General Attorney in 1963. In 1964, the Supreme Court decided New York Times v. Sullivan 9-0 in favor of the New York Times, overturning a libel conviction and establishing the modern rules for libel for public figures. In 1967, Goodale spearheaded the financial reorganization of the Times. He advised the Times' publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger to purchase Cowles Communications, a transaction that helped the Times regain profitability. He also conceived and implemented the stock structure which was used to bring the New York Times public, a structure that was later copied by The Washington Post and other media companies. =Pentagon Papers= In March 1971, former Defense Department employee Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers to New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan. Executives at the Times argued for three months about whether to publish them or not. Harding Bancroft, the Senior Vice President, Sidney Gruson, Assistant to the Publisher, and the Times' outside counsel, Lord Day & Lord, advised the Times not to publish. Goodale successfully convinced publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger that the First Amendment protected the New York Times from prosecution for publishing classified information. On June 13, 1971, the Times printed its first articles and documents of the Pentagon Papers. When Attorney General John Mitchell indicated the Justice Department would sue the New York Times to stop any further publication, Lord Day & Lord refused to represent it and quit the night before the first court hearing.David Rudenstine, The Day the Presses Stopped, (1996) Goodale, along with the law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel and Yale Law School professor Alexander Bickel, defended the Times in court. Goodale was the first to develop the now widely accepted argumentshttp://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/11/30/wikileaks_espionage_act that the Espionage Act should not apply to publishers or the press. These arguments were later adopted after the Pentagon Papers trial by District Court Judge Murray Gurfein.Sanford Ungar, The Papers and the Papers, (1972) After his decision, the Justice Department dropped the Espionage Act argument from the case. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the US government could not stop the Times from publishing the Pentagon Papers, holding that prior restraints were barred by the First Amendment unless the publication \\"will surely result in direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to our Nation or its people.\\" =Reporter's Privilege= In January 1970, as part of a wave of subpoenas issued to national reporters, New York Times reporter Earl Caldwell was subpoenaed by the US Justice Department. Media organizations such as Newsweek, Time, and Life magazines complied with their subpoenas,Henry Raymont, \\"Magazines' Files Under Subpoena, New York Times, February 1, 1970 but Goodale caused the New York Times and Caldwell to challenge Caldwell's subpoena. Caldwell and the Times argued in court he did not have to answer questions from a grand jury about the identity of his sources because, as a member of the press, he was protected by the First Amendment. Caldwell and the New York Times won in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, thereby establishing reporter's privilege for the first time in any court. In 1972, Caldwell v. United States was merged with two other similar cases at the Supreme Court and became known as Branzburg v. Hayes. Goodale crafted the media's strategy at the Supreme Court level. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court overturned Caldwell's case and held reporters, in the circumstances of the case, do not have a First Amendment right to protect their sources and defy a subpoena. Justice Powell's concurrence with the majority was the swing vote. Goodale subsequently wrote an article for the Hastings Law Journal in which he argued that Justice Powell's concurrence with the majority actually argued for a qualified reporter's privilege, \\"though, on its face, their ruling said just the opposite.\\" He argued the Court's ruling was narrow and so the reporter's privilege should be judged on a case-by-case basis.\\"Branzburg v. Hayes and the Developing Qualified Privilege for Newsmen,\\" 26 Hastings Law Journal 709, 1975 Using his article as a basis for protecting reporters' sources, he persuaded other media companies, such as Time, NBC, CBS, and The Washington Post to refuse to comply with government subpoenas. He argued using the power of contempt to resist requests for sources would cause state and federal courts, as well as state legislatures, to recognize a qualified reporters' privilege. This strategy succeeded, as over 1000 reporters privilege cases have been brought before state and federal court since his Hastings Law Review article, while only two or three were brought before. As of 2013, thirty nine states and the District of Columbia have some form of a reporter's shield law, ten other states have a common law privilege, and most federal circuits recognize a reporter's privilege as well‚Äîmany using the language proposed in Goodale's law review article. Goodale's interpretation of Powell's concurrence was confirmed in 2007, when notes of Powell's were discovered saying reporter's privilege cases should be decided on a case-by-case basis. In October 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew subpoenaed reporters for the New York Times and Washington Post for its sources on a story detailing the confidential criminal investigation into Agnew's dealings when he was Governor of Maryland. Instead of complying with the subpoenas, Goodale devised a strategy whereby the reporters' notes would be given to New York Times publisher A.O. Sulzberger and Washington Post owner Katharine Graham and they would refuse to hand them over to the court. If Agnew wanted the reporters' notes, the judge would have to send the owners of the two biggest newspapers in the country to jail. Agnew's subpoenas were dropped after he resigned the Vice Presidency the following month.Martin Arnold, \\"Resignation Ends a Court Test on Disclosure of News Sources,\\" New York Times, October 12, 1973. In 1978, New York Times reporter Myron Farber was subpoenaed by a New Jersey state court in the murder trial of Dr. Mario Jascalevich and refused to testify on the advice of Goodale. He subsequently caused Farber and the Times to go into contempt of court. Farber spent 40 days in jail and the New York Times was fined a total of $101,000 dollars. The Governor later returned the fines and New Jersey passed a state law providing reporters a qualified privilege in response to the case. Because of his work at the New York Times, his law review article and subsequent media law seminars, Goodale has been called the \\"father of reporter's privilege.\\" Post-New York Times Career Goodale joined Debevoise & Plimpton in 1980, bringing The New York Times as a client with him. He established two practice groups, one for the representation of media companies, particularly new media companies such as cable television, the other for First Amendment and intellectual property litigation. At Debevoise, he or his groups have represented The New York Times, the Hearst Corporation, NBC, Cablevision, the New York Observer, Paris Review, Infinity Broadcasting, the NFL, NHL, and NBA. He has personally represented George Plimpton, Harry Evans, Tina Brown, Margaret Truman, and former New York City Mayor John Lindsay. In 2001, Debevoise & Plimpton represented The New York Times in the Supreme Court case of New York Times Co. v. Tasini. This was the fourth case in which Goodale represented The New York Times at the Supreme Court. As counsel to George Plimpton, Goodale convinced Plimpton to turn The Paris Review into a non-profit foundation. Over the initial rejections of Plimpton, Goodale's decision to make the literary magazine a non-profit foundation ensured The Paris Review would survive beyond Plimpton's 2003 death.George, Being George: George Plimpton's Life, Nelson W. Aldrich, (2008) Plimpton had been the magazine's editor and part owner since 1953. Goodale also assisted in the creation of The New York Observer, which was founded by Arthur L. Carter. Goodale also arranged for Carter to purchase The Nation magazine from Victor Navasky, which was, in turn, re-purchased by Navasky. =Books= On April 30, 2013, Goodale's book Fighting for the Press: the Inside Story of the Pentagon Papers and Other Battles was published by CUNY Journalism Press. In this book, Goodale analyzes the importance of the Pentagon Papers case and also chronicles significant events in the history of freedom of the press in the United States from 1968 to the date of publication (2013). The New York Times, and the New York Review of Books reviewed the book favorably. The book received positive reviews from numerous other sources. The Times said > Goodale, though, had a unique vantage point, and gives a deeply informed, > even gossipy firsthand look at the legal strategy as well as conflicts > between editorial and business interests inside the offices of the Times. He > anticipated that the newspaper's white-shoe law firm -- it had the prayful > name of Lord, Day & Lord -- would oppose publication, citing the Espionage > Act. Its refusal to stand by the newspaper was a decision that will live in > legal infamy. The Pentagon Papers case gets the most attention here, but > Goodale doesn't neglect other, still unsettled First Amendment fights > concerning the protection of a reporter's notes and sources. The timing of the book proved to be fortuitous and prescient. Thirteen days after publication (May 13, 2013) it was reported that the government had obtained a secret warrant to search the Associated Press's (AP) records for the source of leaks about an alleged act of terrorism. Six days later (May 19) Fox News reporter James Rosen was named as a co-conspirator in an application for a search warrant for the records of Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a source of Rosen's story about espionage in North Korea. On June 9, 2013, The Washington Post and The Guardian published Edward Snowden's leaks of a National Security Administration program to monitor the phone calls of U.S. citizens. Since Goodale had predicted in his book that President Barack Obama would attempt to criminalize the newsgathering process, and because the Snowden leak was generally analogous to the leak of the Pentagon Papers, Goodale was swept up into the controversy involving these matters. His defense of the press in the AP and Rosen cases and the Washington Post and The Guardian in the publication of Snowden's leaks attracted national attention. Other Books Goodale is the author of The New York Times Company v. United States, a collection of the legal papers in the Pentagon Papers case which he assembled immediately following the decision in that case. It was published by Arno Press in 1971. He also wrote All About Cable (Law Journal Press, New York, 1981). At the time cable was considered new media, and Goodale outlined the legal problems past, present and future facing cable television, including those concerning the First Amendment. The book has been cited twice by the United States Supreme Court.Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. F.C.C., 518 U.S. 727 (1996); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. F.C.C., 512 U.S. 622 (1994) =Television and Print= From 1995 to 2010, he hosted and produced Digital Age, a television program on media and society, which aired on WNYE- TV, initially a PBS station, broadcast in 10 million homes in the New York metropolitan area. The program was called Telecommunications and the Internet Revolution from 1995-1999. His guests have included Ben Bradlee, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., Walter Cronkite, Tom Brokaw, Arthur Schlesinger, Henry Kissinger, Dan Rather, Chuck Schumer, and Michael Bloomberg.http://www.jamesgoodale.net/images/New_Yorker_Article.doc He conceived, with Fred Friendly, Columbia University's media and society seminars. The program still airs on PBS television as the \\"Fred Friendly Seminars.\\" From 1977 to 2010 he wrote a column in the New York Law Journal on \\"Communications and Media Law.\\" His articles on the First Amendment have been published in The Stanford and Hastings Law Reviews, The New York Times, The New York Review of Books (cover piece), The Nation, The New York Observer, The National Law Journal and The Daily Beast. He has appeared on News War, the award winning PBS series Frontline, and the documentary The Most Dangerous Man in the America ‚Äì Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers, which was nominated for an Academy Award in 2009. =Teaching= Goodale has taught at Yale Law School from 1977 to 1980, New York University School of Law from 1983 to 1986 and Fordham Law School from 1986‚Äìpresent. He founded the Communications Law Seminar at the Practising Law Institute for media lawyers, which effectively formed the first media and First Amendment bar association for lawyers representing media companies. He chaired the Seminar from 1972 until its 35th anniversary in 2007. It is one of the largest legal seminars in the U.S. With Yale and The Ford Foundation, he started in 1976 the Master of Studies in Law and Journalism Program (technically known as the Masters Study in Law) for journalists to specialize in law for one year at Yale Law School. Linda Greenhouse, the noted Times Supreme Court reporter, is a graduate of this program. =Politics= Goodale is a lifelong Democrat. He chaired the New York Lawyers Committee for the former Governor of Massachusetts Michael Dukakis, when Dukakis was the Democratic nominee for President in 1988. He was also a member of the Rules Committee of the 1988 Democratic National Convention. In 1976 he was appointed by Governor Hugh Carey to the New York State Privacy & Security Committee https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/58326NCJRS.pdf and in 1988 was appointed by Chief Judge, Sol Wachtler to the New York State Judicial Committee for Minorities where he became chairman in 1991.http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1357&context;=ulj =Boards= From 1989 to 2014 Goodale was a board member of the Committee to Protect Journalists. He served as the board's Chairman from 1989 to 1994, where he raised CPJ's profile internationally and significantly increased its budget. His first year as chairman, CPJ had a budget of $300,000 and no endowment. By 2014 it had a budget of more than $4.5 million with a $13 million endowment. Goodale has also served on the boards of The New York Times, New York Times Foundation, New York Observer, Human Rights Watch, Media Law Reporter, Paris Review Foundation, and the International Center for Journalists. =Controversy= In 2005, Goodale criticized Time Magazine editor Norman Pearlstine's decision to turn over reporter Matthew Cooper's notes to the grand jury investigating the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's name to the press. \\"A public company must protect its assets even if that means going into contempt,\\" Goodale said. \\"It has an obligation under the First Amendment to protect those assets, and it's in the interest of shareholders to protect those assets. Goodale called Pearlstine's decision \\"disgraceful\\" and attempted to have him removed from the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Pearlstine published his account of the controversy in a 2007 book Off the Record: The Press, the Government, and the War over Anonymous Sources. Personal life Goodale played hockey and baseball at Yale and maintains a lifelong interest in skating and hockey. He owned the Sky Rink, a full-sized skating rink on 33rd Street in Manhattan. From 1998-2014 he published a digital newsletter for hockey hobbyists titled MMMCS. Its name was an acronym for the \\"Murray Murdoch Marching and Chowder Society.\\" Murray Murdoch, a former member of the New York Rangers, was Goodale's college coach. In 1973 he founded Washington Gunnery Hockey & Skating Association, a youth hockey organization in Washington, Connecticut. James Goodale is married to the former Toni Krissel of New York City who is President of an international fund-raising firm, T.K. Goodale Associates. They are the parents of Tim (Principal, Bridge Haven Capital Ltd., London) and Ashley (formerly of the NYC Office of Legal Counsel), and the foster parents of Clayton Akiwenzie, a Native American (Senior Vice President, Berkadia, San Francisco).

He had a role in the genesis of neoclassical architecture during the second half of the 18th century. Education; career in Rome Capriccio of Tivoli (1769), private collectionBorn in Paris, Cl√©risseau was a pupil of the architect Germain Boffrand. In 1746, in his mid-twenties, he won a Premier Prix de Rome in the architectural competition to design Un grand h√¥tel, or great mansion. The prize included a scholarship to study in Rome, and in 1749 Cl√©risseau became an official pensionnaire (resident) at the French Academy in Rome, where his instructors included the painter of ruins Giovanni Paolo Pannini. In Rome he also befriended Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Claude-Joseph Vernet, and in 1752 the three of them set out on a sketching tour of Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. Before beginning to draw, the three first had to cut and burn away the undergrowth, where lurked colonies of venomous snakes and scorpions. In 1753, Cl√©risseau's final months at the Academy were marred by a bitter dispute with its director, Charles-Joseph Natoire. Cl√©risseau was for a time expelled, but was eventually allowed to return and complete his scholarship.The controversy is recounted by O'Brien (1985), pp. 65-66: \\"About 1750, the papal government began to enforce a system to ensure that all Catholics in Rome would fulfill their 'paschal duty,' i.e., confession and communion at least once in the Easter season. Upon receiving these sacraments, Catholics got simple slips that they were to present to the pastor of the parish where they resided. In 1753, Natoire demanded that the students of the French Academy submit their communion slips to him. Angered by the students' refusal to comply with this demeaning innovation, Natoire singled out the oldest and most respected one, the architect Charles-Louis Cl√©risseau, for exemplary punishment. In July 1753, several months before the expiration of his scholarship, he was expelled from the academy. After suffering great anguish over the likely ruin of his career, he was readmitted. He had to apologize privately to Natoire, who did not demand the communion slip.\\" In 1755 the Scottish architect Robert Adam arrived in Florence, where he met Cl√©risseau, who accompanied him to Rome; there Adam resolved, under the spell of Cl√©risseau, to produce a volume for publication upon his return that would establish him as a serious architect. The project he selected was a volume documenting the ruins of Diocletian's Palace at Split, easily accessible on the Dalmatian coast. Over a period of five weeks in 1757 Adam sketched and supervised the documentation of the ruins, while Cl√©risseau produced perspectives, and two German draftsmen undertook the measured drawings. Most of the published engravings in Adam's Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro (1764) are believed to be the work of Cl√©risseau, though he received no credit. Cl√©risseau passed most of the next decades in Rome. As it had done since the High Renaissance, ancient Rome and modern Rome functioned as a cultural hub, the ruins of Classical Antiquity providing a school in themselves, if one had a knowledgeable guide. Cl√©risseau served as a mentor to a generation of young architectural students who (like Cl√©risseau) had won the prestigious Prix de Rome and came to study at the French Academy in Rome. He also guided the developing taste for the Antique in young French and British artists and gentlemen amateurs on the Grand Tour. His skillful drawings of ancient architectural details, of real Roman ruins and imaginary ones, helped form the taste of young architects like Robert Adam in the 1750s and his brother James Adam, in 1760-63. Cl√©risseau added to his income by providing architectural illustrations, sometimes in series, for young men on the Grand Tour.Skinner (1963), p. 162.

Cl√©risseau became a magnet for young neoclassical architects, like Fran√ßois-Joseph B√©langer, who themselves never visited Rome. As a designer and architect, Cl√©risseau attracted a prestigious clientele, including Catherine the Great. \\"Catherine had been buying wholesale quantities of albums of prints and drawings with views of Graeco-Roman structures, and these came to include numerous gouaches by Cl√©risseau...[which] were made accessible to Neoclassical architects working for Catherine, notably to Giacomo Quarenghi and Charles Cameron.\\" But when in 1773 she commissioned from Cl√©risseau \\"a series of drawings...as part of her plans to build an 'Antique' park pavilion, Cl√©risseau enraged her by sending a vast quantity of drawings for an immense and grandiose palace‚Äîand a huge bill.\\"Neverov (2000/2001), pp. 22-23. For the H√¥tel Grimod de La Reyni√®re, built in Paris in 1775, Cl√©risseau and √âtienne de La Vall√©e Poussin executed the first decorative scheme in Europe to be inspired by the recent archaeological discoveries at Pompeii and Herculanum. The painted boiseries were sold in 1850 and may be seen in part at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. From 1785-89, Cl√©risseau assisted Thomas Jefferson in producing designs for the Virginia State Capitol. At the time, Jefferson was residing in Paris, serving as American Minister to France. Jefferson wrote that \\"it was a considerable time before I could find an architect whose taste had been formed on a study of ancient models of this art; the style of architecture in this capital [Paris] being far from chaste.\\" Cl√©risseau, he noted, \\"has studied 20 years in Rome, and has given proofs of his skill and taste by a publication of some antiquities of this country.\\" Jefferson was referring to the first (and only) volume in Cl√©risseau's intended series Antiquit√©s de la France, published in Paris in 1788 with the subtitle Monumens de Nismes. The folio included detailed engravings of the Maison Carr√©e, the ancient Roman temple in N√Æmes that inspired Cl√©risseau's collaboration with Jefferson on the design for the Virginia State Capitol. Jefferson admired the Maison Carr√©e as \\"one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful and precious morsel of architecture left us by antiquity.\\"Hafertepe (2000), pp. 223-224. Cl√©risseau in museums Cl√©risseau created works on paper using a variety of media, often in combination, including pencil, chalk, ink, watercolor, and gouache. Many of his works were reproduced as etchings by engravers including Domenico Cunego (the series Views of Antique Buildings and Famous Ruins in Italy), Francesco Bartolozzi, Francesco Zucchi and Paolo Santini. The largest cache of Cl√©risseau's work (almost 200 items) is in the collection of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. Another large group is conserved at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Works by Cl√©risseau are also in the collections of the Louvre, the Mus√©e Cantini in Marseille, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Albertina in Vienna, the Rijksmuseum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Blanton Museum in Austin, and the Legion of Honor in San Francisco.

History =Ancient Christian writers: Augustine of Hippo= Augustine of Hippo was one of the first Christian ancient Latin authors with a very clear anthropological vision, although it is not clear if he had any influence on Max Scheler, the founder of philosophical anthropology as an independent discipline, nor on any of the major philosophers that followed him. Augustine has been cited by Husserl and Heidegger as one of the early writers to inquire on time-consciousness and the role of seeing in the feeling of \\"Being-in-the-world\\".Husserl, Edmund. Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness. Tr. James S. Churchill. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1964, 21.Heidegger, Being and Time Trs. Macquarrie & Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964. 171. Articulating on how \\"Being-in-the- world\\" is described through thinking about seeing: \\"The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of concupiscentia.\\" Heidegger, quoting the Confessions: \\"Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'\\". Augustine saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body.Gianni (1965), pp. 148‚Äì49. He was much closer in this anthropological view to Aristotle than to Plato.Hendrics (1954), p. 291.Massuti, p.98. In his late treatise On Care to Be Had for the Dead sec. 5 (420 AD) he insisted that the body is essential part of the human person: Augustine's favourite figure to describe body-soul unity is marriage: caro tua, coniux tua ‚Äì your body is your wife.Augustine of Hippo, Enarrationes in psalmos, 143, 6; CCL 40, 2077 [46] ‚Äì 2078 [74]); De utilitate ieiunii, 4, 4‚Äì5; CCL 46, 234‚Äì35. Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the fall of humanity they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another. They are two categorically different things: the body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions.Augustine of Hippo, De quantitate animae 1.2; 5.9 Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.Augustine of Hippo, De quantitate animae 13.12: Substantia quaedam rationis particeps, regendo corpori accomodata. Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and Descartes were, with going too much into detail in his efforts to explain the metaphysics of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they were metaphysically distinct. To be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and that the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.On the free will (De libero arbitrio) 2.3.7‚Äì6.13Mann, p. 141‚Äì142 According to N. Blasquez, Augustine's dualism of substances of the body and soul doesn't stop him from seeing the unity of body and soul as a substance itself.El concepto del substantia segun san Agustin, pp. 305‚Äì350. Following Aristotle and other ancient philosophers, he defined man as a rational mortal animal ‚Äì animal rationale mortale.De ordine, II, 11.31; CCL 29, 124 [18]; PL 32,1009; De quantitate animae, 25, 47‚Äì49; CSEL 89, 190‚Äì194; PL 32, 1062‚Äì1063Couturier (1954), p. 543 =Modern period= Philosophical anthropology as a kind of thought, before it was founded as a distinct philosophical discipline in the 1920s, emerged as post-medieval thought striving for emancipation from Christian religion and Aristotelic tradition.Apostolopoulou, Georgia The Problem of Religion in Helmuth Plessner's Philosophical Anthropology, in Reimer, A. James and Siebert, Rudolf J. (1992) The Influence of the Frankfurt school on contemporary theology: critical theory and the future of religion, pp.42‚Äì66. Quotation from p.49: The origin of this liberation, characteristic of modernity, has been the Cartesian skepticism formulated by Descartes in the first two of his Meditations on First Philosophy (1641). Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804) taught the first lectures on anthropology in the European academic world. He specifically developed a conception of pragmatic anthropology, according to which the human being is studied as a free agent. At the same time, he conceived of his anthropology as an empirical, not a strictly philosophical discipline.Thomas Sturm, Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009). Both his philosophical and his anthropological work has been one of the influences in the field during the 19th and 20th century.Grolier (1981) The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 21 p. 768 After Kant, Ludwig Feuerbach is sometimes considered the next most important influence and founder of anthropological philosophy.Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Poolla Tirupati Raju (1966) The concept of man: a study in comparative philosophy p. 490 Judith Deutsch Kornblatt, Richard F. Gustafson (1996) Russian religious thought p. 140 quotation: During the 19th century, an important contribution came from post-Kantian German idealists like Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, as well from S√∏ren Kierkegaard. = Philosophical anthropology as independent discipline = Since its development in the 1920s, in the milieu of Germany Weimar culture, philosophical anthropology has been turned into a philosophical discipline, competing with the other traditional sub-disciplines of philosophy such as epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, logic, and aesthetics.Fischer (2006) p.64, quotation: It is the attempt to unify disparate ways of understanding behaviour of humans as both creatures of their social environments and creators of their own values. Although the majority of philosophers throughout the history of philosophy can be said to have a distinctive \\"anthropology\\" that undergirds their thought, philosophical anthropology itself, as a specific discipline in philosophy, arose within the later modern period as an outgrowth from developing methods in philosophy, such as phenomenology and existentialism. The former, which draws its energy from methodical reflection on human experience (first person perspective) as from the philosopher's own personal experience, naturally aided the emergence of philosophical explorations of human nature and the human condition. =1920s Germany= Max Scheler, from 1900 until 1920 had been a follower of Husserl's phenomenology, the hegemonic form of philosophy in Germany at the time. Scheler sought to apply Husserl's phenomenological approach to different topics. From 1920 Scheler laid the foundation for philosophical anthropology as a philosophical discipline, competing with phenomenology and other philosophic disciplines. Husserl and Martin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976), were the two most authoritative philosophers in Germany at the time, and their criticism to philosophical anthropology and Scheler have had a major impact on the discipline. Scheler defined the human being not so much as a \\"rational animal\\" (as has traditionally been the case since Aristotle) but essentially as a \\"loving being\\". He breaks down the traditional hylomorphic conception of the human person, and describes the personal being with a tripartite structure of lived body, soul, and spirit. Love and hatred are not psychological emotions, but spiritual, intentional acts of the person, which he categorises as \\"intentional feelings.\\" Scheler based his philosophical anthropology in a Christian metaphysics of the spirit.Wilkoszewska, Krystyna (2004) Deconstruction and reconstruction: the Central European Pragmatist Forum, Volume 2, p.129 Helmuth Plessner would later emancipate philosophical anthropology from Christianity. Helmuth Plessner and Arnold Gehlen have been influenced by Scheler, and they are the three major representatives of philosophical anthropology as a movement. =From the 1940s= Ernst Cassirer, a neo-Kantian philosopher, was the most influential source for the definition and development of the field from the 1940s until the 1960s. Particularly influential has been Cassirer's description of man as a symbolic animal, which has been reprised in the 1960s by Gilbert Durand, scholar of symbolic anthropology and the imaginary. In 1953, future pope Karol Wojtyla based his dissertation thesis on Max Scheler, limiting himself to the works Scheler wrote before rejecting Catholicism and the Judeo-Christian tradition in 1920. Wojtyla used Scheler as an example that phenomenology could be reconciled with Catholicism.. Some authors have argued that Wojtyla influenced philosophical anthropology.. In the 20th century, other important contributors and influences to philosophical anthropology were Paul H√§berlin (1878‚Äì1960), Martin Buber (1878‚Äì1965),. E.R. Dodds (1893‚Äì1979), Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900‚Äì2002), Eric Voegelin (1901‚Äì85), Hans Jonas (1903‚Äì93), Josef Pieper (1904‚Äì97), Hans-Eduard Hengstenberg (1904‚Äì98), Jean-Paul Sartre (1905‚Äì80), Joseph Mar√©chal (1878‚Äì1944), Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908‚Äì61), Paul Ricoeur (1913‚Äì2005), Ren√© Girard (1923‚Äì2015), Alasdair MacIntyre (1929‚Äì), Pierre Bourdieu (1930‚Äì2002), Hans Blumenberg, Jacques Derrida (1930‚Äì2004), Emerich Coreth (1919‚Äì2006), Leonardo Polo (1926‚Äì2013). Anthropology of interpersonal relationships A large focus of philosophical anthropology is also interpersonal relationships, as an attempt to unify disparate ways of understanding the behaviour of humans as both creatures of their social environments and creators of their own values. It analyses also the ontology that is in play in human relationships ‚Äì of which intersubjectivity is a major theme. Intersubjectivity is the study of how two individuals, subjects, whose experiences and interpretations of the world are radically different understand and relate to each other. Recently anthropology has begun to shift towards studies of intersubjectivity and other existential/phenomenological themes. Studies of language have also gained new prominence in philosophy and sociology due to language's close ties with the question of intersubjectivity. =Michael D. Jackson's study of intersubjectivity= The academic Michael D. Jackson is another important philosophical anthropologist. His research and fieldwork concentrate on existential themes of \\"being in the world\\" (Dasein) as well as interpersonal relationships. His methodology challenges traditional anthropology due to its focus on first-person experience. In his most well known book, Minima Ethnographica which focuses on intersubjectivity and interpersonal relationships, he draws upon his ethnographic fieldwork in order to explore existential theory. In his latest book, Existential Anthropology, he explores the notion of control, stating that humans anthropomorphize inanimate objects around them in order to enter into an interpersonal relationship with them. In this way humans are able to feel as if they have control over situations that they cannot control because rather than treating the object as an object, they treat it as if it is a rational being capable of understanding their feelings and language. Good examples are prayer to gods to alleviate drought or to help a sick person or cursing at a computer that has ceased to function.

Philosophical Anthropology ","title":"Philosophical anthropology"},{"id":"3697419","text":"Landour, a small cantonment town contiguous with Mussoorie, is about from the city of Dehradun in the northern state of Uttarakhand in India.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-23/people/35981980_1_taj- group-chicken-pox-dosa-diner The twin towns of Mussoorie and Landour, together, are a well-known British Raj-era hill station in northern India. Mussoorie-Landour was widely known as the \\"Queen of the Hills\\". The name Landour is drawn from Llanddowror, a village in Carmarthenshire in southwest Wales. During the Raj, it was common to give nostalgic English, Scottish, Welsh or Irish names to one's home (or even to British-founded towns), reflecting one's ethnicity. Names drawn from literary works were also common, as from those by Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Thomas Hardy, Robert Louis Stevenson and many others.  Location and climate  Landour 1869 Landour Landour is located in the Lower Western Himalaya, in the Mussoorie Range, the second of the five parallel folds of the Himalaya. On average, Landour is about 984 ft (300 m) above Mussoorie, which itself is mostly at an altitude of 6,800 to 7,798 ft (2,250 to 2,377m). The town lies largely on an east-west ridge, with a prominent southerly spur connecting its western end to Mussoorie. The altitude differential, aided by Landour being partly Tibet- facing, has a marked effect on the temperature, which can be 2‚Äì3 ¬∞C lower than in Mussoorie. During the monsoon, Landour receives almost daily rainfall, often heavy. Additionally, pre- and post-monsoon showers mean a rainy season that can run from May to September, though it can be shorter. Before the rains arrive, April‚ÄìMay is the warmest period, with the temperatures rising to over 30 ¬∞C. (~85 ¬∞F) on hotter days. December to February is downright cold, especially if one does not receive enough direct sunlight, as on the northern slopes. It can snow anywhere between 3 and 15 times in the winter, at times heavily. In a given year Landour receives perhaps twice the snow that Mussoorie does; it also takes longer to melt especially on the north-facing slopes. If one travels the to Landour from New Delhi by train or bus, a switch at Dehradun is needed. Buses and taxis, and even \\"shared taxis\\", are easily available. There are also direct buses from New Delhi, and one can easily negotiate with taxis at any of New Delhi's railway stations or at the Delhi airport. One can also fly from Delhi in just 40 min to Jolly Grant Airport east of Dehradun, which saves a lot of time, but it takes another 90 minutes to drive up to Landour from the airport. East of Landour lie the small hamlet of Dhanaulti and the Surkhanda Devi temple; further east are Kanatal, Tehri (now submerged by the Tehri dam) and Chamba (not to be confused with the town and district of the same name in Himachal Pradesh). And to the West lie the tourist trap of Kempty Falls, the military town of Chakrata and the region of Jaunsar bordering Himachal Pradesh.  Early history  Landour is within Dehradun District of the former United Provinces. The United Provinces themselves were carved out of the former Northwest Province of the vast Bengal Presidency, which stretched from Burma to the Khyber Pass; accordingly, early accounts show Landour as part of \\"Bengal\\", which was technically true though the description was incomplete. Landour was initially built by and for the British Indian Army. From 1827 when a sanatorium was built in Landour, the town was a convalescent station for the military, and hence much of Landour is a Cantonment. The original sanatorium is now occupied by the Institute of Technology Management (\\"ITM\\") of the DRDO; it is at the eastern end of the Landour ridge. In the early 20th century, a full British Military Hospital (BMH) was opened, with a medical staff that specialized in tropical diseases; the hospital closed soon after 1947. Also within the ITM premises is the former Soldiers' Furlough Home, a holiday home for British and Irish soldiers and JCOs in Indian regiments who lacked the means to return to Europe regularly. Or, the holidaying soldiers were serving in British regiments on rotation in India, their tours of duty lasting anywhere from 6 to 48 months. In terms of area, Landour Cantonment comprises about two-thirds of Landour; the remainder includes Landour Bazaar, which stretches along the spur that connects to Mussoorie. Mussoorie and Landour, 1860s The first permanent building in all of Mussoorie-Landour was also built in Landour in 1825. The house was built by Captain Frederick Young, the \\"discoverer\\" of Mussoorie, who was also the Commandant of the first Gurkha (or Gorkha) battalion raised by the British after prevailing in the Gurkha War. Young's house, \\"Mullingar\\" (hinting at his Irish blood), was the family home during the hot summers in the plains. Young's Dehradun-based battalion, then called the Sirmour (or Sirmoor) Rifles, was initially raised in a Gurkha POW camp in Paonta Sahib in Sirmour District ‚Äì hence the name. The huge L-shaped building, with an outsized courtyard inside the bend of the \\"L\\", sits prominently atop Mullingar Hill in Landour Cantonment. Among distinguished house guests at Mullingar in the early decades were Emily Eden (see below). Mullingar was expanded, changed hands several times and by the early 20th century had become the Mullingar Estate Hotel. During World War II, Mullingar was leased by the army to house the overflow of convalescing soldiers from the sanatorium, given the huge increase in war-related injuries. The hotel was bursting at the seams, as a number of British civilian evacuees from Burma, the Andamans, Manipur & Nagaland, which were occupied by Japanese forces, were also housed in Mullingar before being shipped out elsewhere. Mullingar finally fell into disuse after 1947 when Britons began to leave India, with the army already having vacated it after the postwar demobilization of 1945‚Äì46. The building soon fell into disrepair, occupied largely if not entirely by squatters (see below). A number of the families now living in Mullingar are Tibetan. Prayer flags flutter in the wind every day, and Losar celebrations are held in the courtyard every year. The legal distinction between Mussoorie and Landour did not arise until the 1860s, when after the historic events of 1857 cantonments were properly surveyed and formalized. In particular, control of the ridge- lines and water sources was crucial, given rising British anxieties over their grip on India. The defensibility of garrisons was critical, especially in hill stations with large European populations. The Cantonments Act of 1924 further clarified the rights of the property owners; new construction of any kind, especially of private homes, was virtually banned. Conservation was also a key goal, given the excesses of the 19th century (see below); the Act clearly states that title to all trees remains with the army, hence there has been no logging in Landour since in over a century, as can be seen. By definition, all non-military and non-governmental buildings built after 1924 are 'illegal'. Therefore, there are few 'modern' homes in Landour, though renovations and reconstruction of pre-existing houses are permitted. Thanks to the 1924 Act, Landour Cantonment is‚Äîunlike Landour Bazaar‚Äîlargely free of the crass commercialization that has scarred much of Mussoorie proper, especially along the 'main drag' of Mall Road where budget tourists throng in the summer. (Proximity to Delhi, Chandigarh and Ambala is both a blessing and a curse). Racially, Landour was distinctly more European than Mussoorie. It was no accident. First, the army presence (albeit non-regimental) offered an excuse to 'keep out' Indians. Second, Maharajas were encouraged to build grand summer homes, but were directed towards Mussoorie. Among them were the ruling families of Kapurthala, Nabha, Alwar, Jind, Baroda, Kasmanda, Katesar, Kuchesar and other princely states. And this despite Maharajas being hand-in- glove with the Raj in terms of ruling the Indian masses; the former, who remained nominally 'autonomous', legitimized the rule of the latter. Tellingly, not a single princely residence was ever built in Landour. (The only 'exception' was The Castle, see below, but it was built by the British as a quasi-prison). Even the ruling family of Tehri-Garhwal (from whom the region was seized by the British) had no residence in Landour, though the family later did acquire some properties from Britons who sold out. These racial barriers, while quite real were more informal than formal; they began to weaken after World War I as the Indian freedom movement gained steam. The author Emily Eden, sister of the Governor-General Lord Auckland, wrote incisively about the biting racism of Britons towards all Indians (except Maharajas, whose over-the-top hospitality they craved), after spending much time in Landour, Shimla and Ooty in the late 1830s. Many Anglo-Indian families also put down roots in Landour, and in Barlowganj just below Mussoorie, in the 19th century. They were attracted in part by the schools, and by the sense of 'otherness' versus quotidian India. A handful remain, most having emigrated after 1947, but the few who remain (most are in their golden years) are treasure troves of local lore. Indeed, the events of 1857 led to a spurt in the European population of Mussoorie-Landour, with many families leaving the 'exposed' towns of the Gangetic Plain. Among the Britons who thus moved to Landour were the parents of Jim Corbett. Both had lost their spouses, and would meet and remarry in Landour (see below). His mother had moved from Meerut, where her first husband had been killed in action in 1857. Thousands of Europeans, mostly Britons, are buried in the twin towns. The Cantonment has adjacent Protestant and Catholic cemeteries, though due to overcrowding in the former, the latter has of late become non-denominational ‚Äì they are managed by the same committee. In 1901, the town had a population of 1720, which climbed up to 3700 in the summers, when the heat of the Indian plains became unbearable.  Civic Administration  Since Landour is a cantonment town, it is administered by the cantonment board which is under the control of the Ministry of Defence. The Station Commander of the Cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Board, and an officer an officer of the IDES or Defence Estates Organisation is the Chief Executive Officer who is also the Member- Secretary of the Board. The President of Landour Cantonment Board is Brig. SN Singh while the CEO is Shri Abhishek Rathour, IDES. Councillors, or representatives of citizens, are elected from 6 wards in Landour.  A few local facts  A view of the valley from Landour, Uttarakhand Like Mussoorie and Dehradun, Landour has long been a center of secondary education. The towns have had several schools and \\"orphanages\\" for both European and mixed-race Anglo-Indian children since the mid-19th century. (Hint: \\"Orphanage\\" was often a Raj-era euphemism for a school for illegitimate mixed-race children). Also, there were many missionary-run schools, of which the most well-known was (and remains) Woodstock School, founded in 1854 for the children of American missionaries. Practically all of the other prominent schools including Wynberg Allen School, St. George's School, Mussoorie Public School, Waverley Convent (now CJM) and Vincent Hill (now Guru Nanak 5th Centenary School) are in Mussoorie, not Landour. The Indian Army also runs a primary school in Landour Cantonment. Landour Community Hospital, originally established 1931 There are under 100 detached private homes in the Cantonment, and under 200 buildings overall. The non-residential buildings belong to either the military, or to the state-owned broadcasters Doordarshan and All India Radio, who have repeater stations atop Lal Tibba hill, at over 7,700 ft. the highest point in all of Mussoorie-Landour. The transmitters are mounted on Landour's answer to Paris, an Eiffel-inspired orange-and-white tower that is the most recognizable feature in all of Landour. Lal Tibba was also known as Depot Hill, referring to the convalescent depot. Nearby Sisters Bazaar likewise referred to the nurses' dormitory at the location; nurses are still addressed as 'Sister' in the Subcontinent, from a time in the 19th century when most nurses were Anglican, Methodist or Catholic nuns. The Cantonment is also home to the well- known Landour Community Hospital, founded by American missionaries. At the time of its founding in 1931 it was one of the first good non-military hospitals in the region. It has been run by the Emmanuel Hospital Association, an indigenous Christian health and development agency, since 1981, and continues to provide affordable (or free) medical care to the people of Landour and the surrounding hills. Sisters Bazaar Among natural features in the area, the local peaks are the most prominent. ('Tibba' is a local word for hill/peak). Other than \\"Old\\" Lal Tibba and Landour hill themselves (which lie within the Cantonment), there is the hunched, heavily forested Pari Tibba (also called Fairy Hill or Witches' Hill), lurking due south of Woodstock School and due east of Wynberg-Allen School. Once a private hunting estate of the ruling family of Tehri-Garhwal, it was not deforested for that very reason. It is also called Burnt Hill, referring to the unusual number of lightning strikes it has taken over the years, which has given rise to local superstitions and also helped keep it free of humans. The hill remains a popular hiking spot for the local boarding schools, but not having motorable roads is blessedly free of \\"tourism\\". Due north of Landour, away as the crow flies is Nag Tibba ('Serpent's Peak'), at 3,022 m (9,972 ft) the highest peak in the local region. It lends its name to the Nag Tibba Range, itself the next-northerly of the five folds of the Himalaya. To the east of Landour are Tope Tibba and the oddly shaped Pepperpot mountain; both are hiking destinations. There are no commercial hotels in Landour Cantonment, and only a handful of rudimentary, quasi-legal \\"guest houses\\". Landour Bazaar has fewer than 10 equally rudimentary hotels, none of which would merit a single star, with all of them together having perhaps 125 rooms. (Mussoorie proper has over a hundred hotels at various price points, though). There were never any entertainments in Landour ‚Äì all the Raj-era theaters, cinemas, dance halls, skating rinks and public gardens were in Mussoorie. Accordingly, the decibel level was ‚Äì and is ‚Äì markedly lower (thanks to the military's zoning rules) than in Mussoorie, where it is ever-rising thanks to the explosion in middle- class tourism.  Americana in the Himalaya  Aside from the obvious British legacy, Landour has a thick vein of Americana too, with American missionaries having had a strong footing in the town since the 1830s, when the policy changes introduced by the English administrator Lord Macaulay prompted the rapid growth of American missions across India, particularly those of the Presbyterian and Baptist churches. Generations of American missionary children (see Third Culture Kids) were educated at Woodstock School and/or born in Landour (see John Birch, below). Of late, their descendants have been deeming a dekko worthwhile. Nowadays, many young Americans on gap years or on exchange programs spend time learning Hindi at the popular Landour Language School, which was founded in the late 19th century to teach newly arrived missionaries. Another durable reminder of the American connection is the ubiquitous Landour Community Cookbook (1st formal edition: 1938; informal stencil copies since c. 1900) though the Landour Community Center‚Äîonce the locus of Anglo-American community life‚Äîis itself moribund. A half-dozen bakers in Landour still offer various breads, cookies/biscuits and cakes from 'The Cookbook', though with the rise of packaged foods and the departure of most missionaries, the bakeries are a pale shadow of their former selves. Landour was also one of the first places in India where an American classic such as peanut butter was made commercially; Plausibly, a number of houses in Landour have American (rather than British) names, among them Aloha, Hollywood and Roanoke.  Ecology and environment  Landour is for the most part (unlike largely deforested Mussoorie) carpeted by old-growth forests of deodar cedar, Himalayan oak, chir pine, blue pine, West Himalayan fir, Himalayan maple, rhododendron, Himalayan manna ash and other tree species. Landour's north- facing slopes have more deodar and fir than other species; the south-facing slopes have more oak than other species. Pines are at lower elevations than deodar and fir, true to form. Among introduced species, the adaptable Platycladus (Hindi: morpankhi) does well, and Oriental plane (Hindi: chinar) too are seen. A logging ban has long been in place in the reserved forests around Landour, and the ban is reasonably well enforced. Swargarohini and Bandarpunch in the Himalaya, from Landour Landour offers striking views of the Garhwal Himalaya, with a wide vista of up to visible on a clear day. The visible massifs and peaks include (West to East) Swargarohini, Bandarpunch, Yamunotri, Jaonli, Gangotri, Srikanta, Kedarnath, Satopanth, Chaukhamba (Badrinath) and even Nanda Devi. At its closest point, Tibet is about away as the crow flies; it is through Landour that Heinrich Harrer escaped to Tibet during World War II after breaking out of a British internment camp in Dehradun. Birdlife is outstanding in its breadth of species; over 350 species may comfortably be seen at various elevations over the course of the year, including both endemic species and migratory species from Tibet, Central Asia and Siberia. Quite a few endemic species of pheasants and raptors are among the more charismatic species that can be easily seen. As for wild mammals, leopards transit the area from time to time; their prey are mainly dogs, including strays from Landour-Mussoorie and the neighboring villages. Also present are some jackals, barking deer (muntjac), goral (goat-antelope) and the secretive sloth bear. Among smaller mammals, yellow-throated martens, civets, jungle cats, and Himalayan weasels are seen, and the occasional flying squirrel. Pesky rhesus macaques and Hanuman langurs are as present in Landour as anywhere. Poaching has severely reduced the numbers of the larger wild mammals, though the habitat itself could support larger populations. Of course, most charismatic megafauna had already been wiped out by the British in the 19th century. Unsurprising, given the British penchant for 'blood sport', especially among the soldiery. After all, Mussoorie was first 'discovered' by Captain Young on a shooting expedition from his garrison in Dehradun. The ecology of the area clearly shows that tiger, Himalayan black bear, striped hyena, sambar, serow, Himalayan tahr, gaur and other impressive species (all are now locally extinct) were well represented in Mussoorie- Landour before British colonization; 19th-century writings by British hunters boast of the countless trophies they collected in the area. Deforestation itself dates from British times. There was also an early myth that \\"Indian forests are full of germs, which European constitutions cannot take\\"; clear- felling (clear-cutting) was the answer, as even a casual observer can still see, except in the Cantonment, thanks to the 1924 Act (see above). Many reforestation initiatives began in various hill stations in the late 19th century, thanks to some enlightened Raj administrators, but not in Mussoorie. Of late, the Indian Army has done yeoman service via its 'Eco-Battalions' in terms of re-forestation. Another local menace is non-biodegradable refuse. While there have been some steps by the citizenry (without much help from the authorities) to combat this, it remains a challenge. Much refuse is just dumped down hillsides by many locals‚Äîlangurs, macaques, civets, stray dogs and other animals forage these open dumps. While the Indian Army has a somewhat better record, Doordarshan and All India Radio (both state-owned, revealingly) are notorious for calmly dumping most of their garbage down the hillsides of the Cantonment. Few in Landour Bazaar seem to take the environment seriously; that is for the \\"rich\\" of the Cantonment to worry about. Woodstock School, which remains the largest landowner in Landour behind the Indian Army, has sought to be progressive on this score (e.g., by collecting used plastics from across Landour) but its efforts are more effective within and around their own large campus than elsewhere in Landour.  The citizenry  The year-round population of the Cantonment is under 1,200, and if you include Landour Bazaar it is under 4,000. The summertime population of Mussoorie triples to perhaps 90,000 with the influx of budget tourists (and hotel staff, shopkeepers, tradesmen etc. to service them), but the population of Landour Bazaar only goes up by perhaps 1,000, given the paucity of hotels. But the summertime population of the Cantonment goes up by only 500, if that; there is no place for outsiders to stay. Indeed, the weekend population of Mussoorie proper too now spurts‚Äîyear-round‚Äîto near-summertime levels, given the improvements in India's highways and the ever-rising numbers of private cars. The Himalayas from near Char Dukan in Landour, upper Mussoorie The ethnic mix of Landour has changed dramatically since 1947, and since the 1970s‚Äì1980s due to the departure of most missionaries, and also via the recent Indian economic boom. Many of the shopkeepers and small-business owners of Landour Bazaar and the Cantonment are descended from bania merchants who came from far afield in the 19th century‚Äîas far away as Gujarat and Bombay‚Äîto service the then-growing Anglo-American community.  Demographics  According to the 2001 India census, Landour had an \\"official\\" population of roughly 3,500. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%. Landour has an average literacy rate of 78%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 85%, and female literacy is 70%. In Landour, 8% of the population is under 6 years of age. However, these statistics do not account for the transient population of the Cantonment, which includes military personnel on study tours, or the \\"second home\\" crowd that owns many of the properties in Landour Cantonment. Nor does it account for the student population at Woodstock or the language school.  Architecture  Architecturally speaking, Landour is akin to other Raj-era hill stations of Northern India. Since Mussoorie-Landour never rivalled Shimla in administrative, political or military terms, there are few 'grand official buildings' to speak of. The private homes are largely the common Raj-era pastiches, with pitched roofs (often painted a dull red) and large verandahs, important given the heavy monsoons. Most houses contain architectural echoes both of Home Counties England and of the resort towns of the Scottish Highlands. Many have well-kept gardens. Char Dukan literally Four Shops, Landour Castle Hill and The Castle, Landour by Samuel Bourne (1865) About the only \\"architecturally significant\\" building was The Castle on the aptly named Castle Hill, now part of Survey of India, where the deposed boy- king Duleep Singh of Punjab, the son of the iconic Maharaja Ranjit Singh, was often \\"kept\\" for convalescent purposes between 1849 and 1853. (Sadly, The Castle was heavily modified in an ad hoc manner over the decades, rendering it unrecognizable as compared to early photographs). The Amir of Afghanistan too was in the town in quasi-exile at various times in the early 20th century as Raj officials engaged in their customary machinations of map-drawing and re- drawing across the Subcontinent. A prominent local landmark was the Clock Tower at the start of Landour Bazaar. It was of little architectural merit, but informally marked the boundary between Landour and Mussoorie (others say it is the former Picture Palace movie theater a bit lower down). Demolished in 2011, the tower is expected to be rebuilt sometime in the future, having been delayed by local political wrangling. Saint Paul Church, built 1839 Landour has four Raj-era churches, two of them distinctly Indo-Gothic in style. Of the four, two remain very much in use: Kellogg Church (built 1903, once American Presbyterian, now non-denominational, and also home to the Landour Language School) and the St. Paul's Church (built 1840, once Anglican, now non- denominational) in Char Dukan,Landour Candour The Economic Times, 9 March 2008. where Jim Corbett's parents, Christopher and Mary Corbett, married on 13 October 1859. A third Methodist church in Landour Bazaar fell into disuse after the Raj ended and was eventually seized by squatters for commercial purposes by way of 'kabza'. The fourth church is the once-Anglican St. Peter's Church, latterly Catholic, and now is disuse and occupied by squatters apparently with the 'permission' of the church committee; it is atop Landour hill.  Residents  Kellogg Memorial Church, Landour, built 1903. Landour also has an outsized presence on the cultural map of India, its most famous resident being the Anglo-Indian author Ruskin Bond.Haven in the hills The Telegraph, Calcutta, 23 April 2005. Another thespian Tom Alter, himself Landour-raised and a Woodstock School graduate, was a part-year resident, spending the remainder of his time in Bollywood. His cousin Stephen Alter, also a Woodstock alum and an \\"Indo-nostalgic\\" author, is often in town for long stretches . Stephen's father Rev. Bob Alter had been principal of Woodstock in the 1970s and 1980s. The media moguls Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy, founders of NDTV, also maintain a second home in Landour. The Hindi film director Vishal Bhardwaj has a house in Landour and is the next door neighbour to Ruskin Bond. Another famous resident of this quaint town is the Indian actor Victor Banerjee. Landour was home in the 1850s and 1860s to the multi- talented John Lang, seen as the \\"first Australian novelist\\". Lang's 1864 grave was rediscovered by Ruskin Bond in Camel's Back Cemetery in Mussoorie and was restored by the Australian High Commission in Delhi (which also has a bolthole nearby). Other bohemians who call Mussoorie (but not Landour) home are the writer Bill Aitken and the husband-wife travel-writing team of Hugh and Colleen Gantzer. And then there is Allan Sealy of Trotter-Nama fame, down in the valley in Dehradun. And finally, Landour was the unlikely birthplace in 1918 of John Birch, in whose name the controversial arch-conservative John Birch Society would be founded in America, after his murder in China at the hand of Communists. Landour has, in large part, survived \\"untouched\\" thanks to the military presence and also due to its small size.  Sources  * Landour Days: A Writer's Journal by Ruskin Bond.

Moquette, derived from the French word for carpet, is a type of woven pile fabric in which cut or uncut threads form a short dense cut or loop pile. As well as giving it a distinctive velvet-like feel, the pile construction is particularly durable, and ideally suited to applications such as public transport. Its upright fibres form a flexible, non-rigid surface, which are constantly displaced to give durability and anti-stain benefits. Traditional moquette fabrics are made from a wool nylon face with an interwoven cotton backing. Origin Moquette originated in France, where it was woven by hand. The standard width was a Flemish ell of 27 inches. There were two finishes: moquette velout√©, which had a cut pile like English Wilton, and moquette boucl√©, which had an uncut pile like Brussels carpet. It is still woven in Yorkshire using traditional techniques. A long-standing moquette manufacturer is Holdsworth Fabrics which dates back to 1822. Examples The most famous moquette in the United States is the one sent by Louis XVI to George Washington. It was made for the banquet room in Mount Vernon, where it can be seen today. Moquette is famous for being used on London Transport's vehicles, particularly the seats of London Underground's Tube trains. During the decades of the many railway companies, there were some ten moquette manufacturers in the UK. As a result of the nationalisation of the railways after World War II and then the Beeching cuts of the early 1960s, the number of customers plummeted. By the mid 1960s there were two suppliers, one of which was Courtaulds. The other is Holdsworth Fabrics based in Huddersfield, UK. Moquette is occasionally used in clothing. In 1932-33, the United States Army Air Corps contracted for cold-weather leather flight suits lined with moquette, apparently as an economy substitute for sheepskin.

The two series differ principally in their use of tense to describe the temporal relation between events and the resulting ontological implications regarding time. The terms were introduced by British idealist philosopher John McTaggart in 1908 as part of his argument for the unreality of time. However, they have since become widely used terms of reference in contemporary discussions of the philosophy of time. History Metaphysical debate about temporal orderings reaches back to the ancient Greek philosophers Heraclitus and Parmenides. Parmenides thought that reality is timeless and unchanging. Heraclitus, in contrast, believed that the world is a process of ceaseless change, flux and decay. Reality for Heraclitus is dynamic and ephemeral. Indeed, the world is so fleeting, according to Heraclitus, that it is impossible to step twice into the same river. McTaggart's series McTaggart distinguished the ancient conceptions as a set of relations. According to McTaggart, there are two distinct modes in which all events can be ordered in time. =A series= In the first mode, events are ordered as future, present, and past. Futurity and pastness allow of degrees, while the present does not. When we speak of time in this way, we are speaking in terms of a series of positions which run from the remote past through the recent past to the present, and from the present through the near future all the way to the remote future. The essential characteristic of this descriptive modality is that one must think of the series of temporal positions as being in continual transformation, in the sense that an event is first part of the future, then part of the present, and then past. Moreover, the assertions made according to this modality correspond to the temporal perspective of the person who utters them. This is the A series of temporal events. Although originally McTaggart defined tenses as relational qualities, i.e. qualities that events possess by standing in a certain relations to something outside of time (that does not change its position in time), today it is popularly believed that he treated tenses as monadic properties. Later philosophers have independently inferred that McTaggart must have understood tense as monadic because English tenses are normally expressed by the non- relational singular predicates \\"is past\\", \\"is present\\" and \\"is future\\", as noted by R. D. Ingthorsson. =B series= From a second point of view, events can be ordered according to a different series of temporal positions by way of two-term relations which are asymmetric, irreflexive and transitive: \\"earlier than\\" (or precedes) and \\"later than\\" (or follows). An important difference between the two series is that while events continuously change their position in the A series, their position in the B series does not. If an event ever is earlier than some events and later than the rest, it is always earlier than and later than those very events. Furthermore, while events acquire their A series determinations through a relation to something outside of time, their B series determinations hold between the events that constitutes the B series. This is the B series, and the philosophy which says all truths about time can be reduced to B series statements is the B-theory of time. =Distinctions= The logic and the linguistic expression of the two series are radically different. The A series is tensed and the B series is tenseless. For example, the assertion \\"today it is raining\\" is a tensed assertion because it depends on the temporal perspective‚Äîthe present‚Äîof the person who utters it, while the assertion \\"It rained on \\" is tenseless because it does not so depend. From the point of view of their truth-values, the two propositions are identical (both true or both false) if the first assertion is made on . The non-temporal relation of precedence between two events, say \\"E precedes F\\", does not change over time (excluding from this discussion the issue of the relativity of temporal order of causally disconnected events in the theory of relativity). On the other hand, the character of being \\"past, present or future\\" of the events \\"E\\" or \\"F\\" does change with time. In the image of McTaggart the passage of time consists in the fact that terms ever further in the future pass into the present...or that the present advances toward terms ever farther in the future. If we assume the first point of view, we speak as if the B series slides along a fixed A series. If we assume the second point of view, we speak as if the A series slides along a fixed B series. Relation to other ideas in the philosophy of time There are two principal varieties of the A-theory, presentism and the growing block universe.Presentism and the Space-Time Manifold by Dean Zimmerman, p. 7 Both assume an objective present, but presentism assumes that only present objects exist, while the growing block universe assumes both present and past objects exist, but not future ones. Views that assume no objective present and are therefore versions of the B-theory include eternalism and four-dimensionalism.

Davenport. Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 12, No. 2 (Mar., 1904), pp. 303-304.  Modern production and distribution  Seager (1904) expressed a specific view on the production and distribution in modern community. Modern business can be divided into twelve branches or principal businesses, as he expressed: :\\"Looking at modern business in a concrete way we may distinguish the following main branches into which production is divided : (1) hunting and fishing, (2) stock-raising, (3) farming, (4) forestry (t. e., logging, lumbering, etc.), (5) mining and quarrying, (6) manufacturing, (7) building, (8) transporting, (9) wholesale and retail trading, (10) produce and stock broking, (11) banking, and (12) insurance. Although by no means exhaustive this list includes the principal businesses to be found in a modern community arranged in about the order in which they have attained prominence...\\"Seager (1904, p. 154) According to Seager, the best adapted form of business organisation is different. In hunting, stock-raising, farming, building, broking, and trading the dominant form is the single-entrepreneur and partnership systems. In lumbering, mining, and manufacturing single entrepreneurs, partnerships, and corporations exist side by side, and in transportation, banking, and insurance the \\"corporate form of organisation holds undisputed sway. In general the corporate form of organisation is that preferred in branches of business where large-scale production is found to be most economical, while in businesses for which small-scale production is better adapted single entrepreneurs and partnerships still have the advantage.\\" Economic production and distribution, 1904 According to Seager, production and distribution in the modern community can be analysed, and graphically pictured, by distinguishing three more basic branches of production: # the extractive industries, which supply materials, # the manufacturing industries, which combine and fashion materials into the forms desired by consumers, and # transportation and trade, which bring manufactured goods to those who are to use them. About the basic interaction, Seager further explained: :\\"As represented in the above figure the three great branches of production are being carried on simultaneously and the goods produced are flowing in a vast stream from the extractive industries, where they originate as materials, to traders who dispose of them in finished forms either to consumers or to producers who use them as capital goods or aids to further production. Although working contemporaneously, successive groups of producers are, of course, engaged on materials previously produced by those employed at the preceding stages. Manufacturers are manufacturing materials turned out somewhat earlier by the extractive industries and transporters and traders are handling goods previously manufactured. The iron ore and the coal that are being mined to-day will come together in blast furnaces and steel mills some weeks or months hence ; the resulting steel will be fashioned into axes, ploughs, building frames, etc., some weeks or months after it has been reduced to ingots or rolled into bars ; these steel products will contribute to the satisfaction of the wants of consumers at a still later period. The average time taken, as production is now organised in the United States, to convert raw material into consumable commodities cannot be accurately measured, but it is certain that it runs into months and probable that it exceeds a year. The vast majority who are at work on any given day help to produce materials or unfinished commodities.\\"Seager (1904, p. 155)  Value, Price, and Distribution  In the chapter about \\"Value, Price, and Distribution\\" Seager explains, that his model of the modern production and distribution can be used to \\"restate the laws determining rent, wages, and interest.\\"Seager (1904, p. 267-9) He stated: Economic value, price and distribution, 1904 :\\"It will be necessary to advert for the last time the relations that would prevail in an industrial society brought Production to the state of normal equilibrium. In such a society the relation between production, distribution, and consumption would be extremely simple. Production would still be carried on as a serial process, but it could be readily analysed, since all prices would correspond exactly to the expenses of production and these would never vary. The whole matter may be represented graphically by the accompanying figure. :In the figure production is represented as subdivided into three great stages, A, B, and C. The extractive industries: (A) turn out raw materials. Manufacturing (B) takes these and transforms them into manufactured products. Transportation and trade (C) deliver the latter as finished products to purchasers, who may be either consumers converting their money incomes into real incomes, or entrepreneurs converting the free replacement fund into capital goods to restore the wastes incidental to production. The figure represents movement without change.\\" And furthermore: :\\"Goods are flowing continuously from stage A to B and from stage B to C. At C the stream is divided, an unvarying volume of capital goods flowing one way and an unvarying stream of consumers' goods flowing the other. The capital goods exactly replace the goods destroyed in the course of production and the consumers' goods exactly remunerate the owners of land, workmen, and owners of capital goods for the productive services which they or their possessions have rendered. Finally the prices of goods are invariable and everywhere just equal to their unvarying expenses of production.\\" Later in the 20th century the model of the circular flow of income has been developed, which comprehends similar concepts.  Principles of economics  In his 1913 Principles of economics Seager further extended his theory of production and distribution. Seager explained: Capitalistic production in a self- contained industrial society, 1911 :\\"Since the relations we are trying to picture are between flows of goods rather than fixed funds of goods, certain of their aspects may be more easily presented in graphic than in arithmetical form. The [accompanying] figure... represents capitalistic production in a self-contained industrial society brought to a state of normal equilibrium. In it are represented in successive and connected compartments the three great branches of production: the extractive industries, manufacturing, and transportation and trade...\\"Seager (1904, p. 192-4) About the flows in the model, he explains: :\\"...Raw materials, the products of the extractive industries, flow through from left to right, being enriched as they pass along by the addition of form, place, time and possession utilities. On leaving the hands of dealers, they are separated into two great streams, one, the replacement fund, which flows back to repair and renew capital goods worn or destroyed in the process of production, the other, consumption goods, which begin immediately to gratify wants. The consumption goods stream is again subdivided, one branch conveying the second and subordinate replacement fund needed to repair and renew the durable consumption goods whose presence is indicated at the top of the diagram and which give off a continuous stream of utilities to mingle with those afforded by transient consumption goods, the other and larger branch into which the main consumption goods stream is divided.\\" And furthermore: :\\"The net product represented in this diagram consists in part of raw materials, in part of manufactured goods, finished and unfinished, and in part of the utilities subsequently added at the stage 'transportation and trade.' Only a very limited part is sufficiently advanced to be flowing out with the stream of consumption goods to minister directly to human wants. On the other hand it is from this stream of consumption goods that the entire real income for which the money income is exchanged is drawn. Although the identical goods constituting the real income are thus for the most part other than the goods constituting the net product, the latter consists of exactly similar utilities quantitatively and qualitatively as the former. At each point the streams of goods flow on evenly and unbrokenly so that the \\" transient consumption goods \\" that are allowed to escape, and which constitute the real income, are exactly replaced by the goods included in the net product. The diagram thus represents movement without change. It depicts the circulation of goods that is going on in actual industrial society with the elements of change and monopoly eliminated.\\" In \\"The economics of retailing\\" Paul Nystrom (1915) further focussed in the 'transportation and trade' stage, and assigned various patterns in the channels of distribution.Nystrom, Paul H.

Ethics. p. 566. In a meeting of the American Association for Labor Legislation, December 30, 1907, Seager presented a program of social legislation: :\\"The ends to be aimed at in any programme of social legislation are: :I. To protect wage-earners in the continued enjoyment of standards of living to which they are already accustomed. :II. To assist them to attain to higher standards of living. :The principal contingencies which threaten standards of living already acquired are: (1) industrial accidents; (2) ill ness; (3) invalidity and old age; (4) premature death; (5) unemployment. These contingencies are not in practice adequately provided against by wage-earners themselves. consequence the losses they entail, in the absence of any social provision against them, fall with crushing force on the families which suffer from them, and only too often reduce such families from a position of independence and self-respect to one of humiliating and efficiency-destroying social dependency. The following remedies for the evils resulting from this situation are suggested.\\"American Association for Labor Legislation. (1908).

Accessed 12.01.2015. = Theory of the Minimum Wage, 1913 = In his 1913 article on the \\"Theory of the Minimum Wage.\\" explains the main contemporary problems around the introduction of minimum wages. Seager started: :\\"From the point of view of economic theory, the proposal that minimum, or living rates of wages be prescribed by law involves two problems. First, how does it happen that for certain classes of workers in certain employments the wages paid fall below a living level. Second, what results may be expected to follow the enforcement of the requirement that no employer shall in future be permitted to pay less to any employee than the living wages pre- scribed. After considering these theoretical problems.\\"Seager (1913, p. 81)0 = Trust and corporation problems, 1929 = business trust. Weidenhammer and Krebs (1930) commented, that this \\"book is mainly concerned with the trust problem. For two reasons, however, the authors thought it advisable to include a chapter on corporations: First most trusts are corporations, and the modern holding company and merger movements depend upon the existence of the economic institution 'corporation', and second, the regulation of trusts must to a certain extent proceed through regulation of corporate practices (stockwatering in order to hide profits, publicity of financial statements, etc.).\\"Robert M.

Informed opinion is coming in recognize, that former legislation which sweepingly condemned 'every combination in restraint of trade' has broken down. An attempt is being made to re-define the issue and to meet them with less prejudice and with more concern for business needs.\\"Mathew O. Tobriner \\"Trust and Corporation Problems by Henry R.

Ernst (1995) summarized: :\\"like other historicist economists, Seager urged that trusts and labor unions be accepted as natural and potentially beneficial developments. They should not be abolished even if they could be, he argued, but they should be regulated to ensure they did not abuse their power. Based largely on his reading of Great Upheaval labor cases, Seager concluded that the courts could not be trusted with the job of policing industrial combinations, because the legal mind was too preoccupied with precedents and traditions to give sufficient regard to the social consequences of industrial combination.\\"  Selected publications  * Seager, Henry R.

It consists of three administrative cantons around the small cities of Eupen, Malmedy, and Sankt Vith which encompass some . In the area itself, the region is referred to as East Belgium (). Elsewhere in Belgium, the region is commonly referred to as the East Cantons (, ). Eupen-Malmedy became part of Belgium in the aftermath of World War I. The region, which had formerly been part of Prussia and the German Empire, was allocated to Belgium by the Treaty of Versailles. It was formally annexed after a controversial referendum in 1920, becoming part of the Province of Li√®ge in 1925. Agitation by German nationalists during the interwar period led to its re-annexation by Nazi Germany during World War II. It was returned to Belgium in 1945. Today, it forms a large component of the German-speaking Community of Belgium, one of Belgium's three federal communities. History =Background= An 1843 map of Belgium, with Eupen and Malmedy shown as part of the Kingdom of Prussia Historically, the territories have little in common. The northern part around Eupen was originally part of the Duchy of Limburg, a dependency of the Duchy of Brabant which was latterly part of the Austrian Netherlands. The Southern part, around Sankt Vith, belonged to the Duchy of Luxembourg. The small village of Manderfeld-Sch√∂nberg belonged to the Archbishopric of Trier. Malmedy and Waimes, except the village of Faymonville, were part of the abbatial principality of Stavelot-Malmedy which was an Imperial Estate of the Holy Roman Empire. By the 19th century, the majority of the territory spoke German while the city of Malmedy was split between French and German speakers. In 1795, as the French Revolutionary Army entered the Austrian Netherlands, the area was also taken over and eventually incorporated in its entirety into the French department of the Ourthe. =Prussian administration, 1815‚Äì1919= At the Congress of Vienna, the whole area was awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia. In the northwest of the area, Moresnet, coveted by both the Netherlands and Prussia for its calamine, was declared a neutral territory. After 1830, the 50 percent guardianship of the Netherlands was taken over by newly independent Belgium, and this remained so even after 1839, when Belgium relinquished its claims to neighbouring Dutch Limburg. View of Eupen in 1900 when the territory was under German rule This change did not significantly affect the inhabitants of this region. Even in the mainly French or Walloon speaking Malmedy, changes went smoothly since the municipality was allowed to continue to use French for its administration until the Kulturkampf when the authorities forbade the use of French. For instance, during a visit to the city in 1856, the King Frederick William IV is believed to have said \\"I am proud to have in my kingdom a little country where people speak French\\". For the people of Malmedy, this would eventually change when German was implemented as the only official administrative language. This was no problem in Eupen and St.Vith but more so in Malmedy-Waimes. There was some resistance to the interdiction: for instance, Roman Catholic priests who were forbidden to preach in French started to preach in Walloon in order to avoid having to preach in German. Most of the territory had spoken German or German dialects for centuries, with Walloon being spoken by about two-thirds of the population in the district of Malmedy at the time it was newly created in 1816.Hahn, Hans-Henning and Kunze, Peter: Nationale Minderheiten und staatliche Minderheitenpolitik in Deutschland im 19. Jahrhundert. Akademie Verlag GmbH, Berlin, 1999 (German) The overwhelmingly German-speaking district of Sankt Vith further south was, in 1821, united with the district of Malmedy to form a new, much larger district of Malmedy that then had a majority of German- speakers. According to the 1 December 1900 population census this new district of Malmedy had only a minority of 28.7% Walloon-speaking inhabitants. The smaller but more populous district of Eupen was almost entirely German- speaking, with Walloon and French speaking minorities making up less than 5 percent.'Foreign-language minorities in the German Reich according to the population census of 1 December 1900 (German) At the beginning of World War I, most of the inhabitants of the Eupen and Malmedy districts considered themselves German and fought for the German Empire during the war. =Provisional Belgian administration, 1919‚Äì25= Map showing the territories lost by the German Empire after World War I. Eupen-Malmedy is labelled \\"8\\" on the map. During World War I, Belgium was invaded by the German Empire and, between 1914 and 1918, much of Belgium's territory was under German military occupation. With the defeat of Germany in 1918, Belgian politicians attempted to expand Belgian territory at German expense. However, the settlement at the Treaty of Versailles proved disappointing for Belgium. Belgium failed to gain any territory from the Netherlands or Luxembourg, but was awarded the small German colonial territory of Ruanda-Urundi in Africa and Eupen-Malmedy in Europe, together with the previously neutral territory of Moresnet. At the time, Eupen-Malmedy had approximately 64,000 residents. Although the Belgian government attempted to depict Eupen-Malmedy as an ethnically Belgian territory, many Belgians were suspicious of the move. In 1919, a Transitional Government was established for Eupen-Malmedy by the Belgian government. It was headed by a Belgian general, Herman Baltia. Under the terms of the Treaty, Belgian control over the territory was contingent on the result of a local plebiscite, held between January and June 1920. The plebiscite itself was held without a secret ballot, and organized as a consultation in which all citizens who opposed the annexation had to formally register their protest; just 271 of nearly 34,000 eligible voters did so. The League of Nations accepted the result and the Transitional Government prepared for the unification of Eupen- Malmedy with Belgium in June 1925. =Integration into Belgium, 1925‚Äì40= In June 1925, the Eupen-Malmedy was finally incorporated into the Belgian state as part of the Province of Li√®ge. The inhabitants of the region voted in its first Belgian general election in 1925 and returned a vote in favour of the centre-right Catholic Party. A local centre-right party, the Christliche Volkspartei (Christian People's Party), emerged by 1929. The early Belgian administration of Eupen-Malmedy was paralleled by secret negotiations between Belgian and Weimar German government of Gustav Stresemann over a possible return of the region in exchange for money. The negotiations collapsed in 1926, following the German signature of the Locarno Treaties (1925) guaranteeing Germany's western borders and international pressure. Various ethnic German organisations emerged in the Eupen-Malmedy region in the late 1920s, campaigning to promote German culture and the return of the territory to Germany. After the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany in 1933, agitation in Eupen-Malmedy increased and many inhabitants began to wear swastika badges. Local socialists began to distance themselves from calls to return to Germany. In 1935, an openly pro-Nazi party emerged locally, known as the Heimattreue Front, which achieved a majority in all three of the Eupen-Malmedy districts in the elections of 1936 and 1939. =Annexed to Germany, 1940‚Äì45= German soldiers welcomed into Malmedy in May 1940 with swastika decoration and Nazi salute. In World War II, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium in May 1940 and rapidly defeated and occupied Belgium for a second time. On 18 May, Hitler announced the re-integration of Eupen-Malmedy into Germany while the rest of the country remained under military occupation. The Belgian government in exile, however, refused to recognise the German annexation and maintained that Eupen-Malmedy was part of Belgium. Administered as part of Nazi Germany, 8,000 local men were conscripted into the German armed forces of whom 2,200 were killed on the Eastern Front. Support for the German takeover eroded sharply after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The region suffered severely during the Ardennes Offensive of 1944‚Äì45 and Sankt Vith, in particular, was nearly totally destroyed by bombing. =Return to Belgium, 1945‚Äìpresent= The seat of the German-speaking Community of Belgium in Eupen, created in 1984 After the war, the Belgian state reasserted sovereignty over the area, which caused the male inhabitants of the area who had served in the German army to lose their civil rights as \\"traitors to the Belgian state\\". After the war, the Belgian authorities opened 16,400 investigations into citizens from Eupen-Malmedy, representing around 25 percent of the region's entire population. In comparison, the figure for the rest of Belgium represented less than five percent. After the war, demands to return Eupen-Malmedy to Germany faded. The first regionalist political party, the Partei der Deutschsprachigen Belgier (Party of German-speaking Belgians, or PDB), emerged in 1971 to argue that greater autonomy to be given to Belgium's German speakers within the newly created federal state but not for regional secession. The PDB's campaign culminated in the creation of the German-speaking Community of Belgium in 1984 which provided cultural autonomy to Belgium's 70,000 German speakers along the same lines as those already negotiated for Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking communities between 1971 and 1980. The nine German-speaking communes of the East Cantons form part of the German-speaking Community while Malmedy and Waimes are part of the French Community. There are protected rights for the minority language in both areas.  Languages spoken in the area  Bilingual German and French road signs in Eupen The linguistic situation of the wider area is complex since it lies on the border between the Romance and Germanic languages and on an isogloss dividing several German dialects. In general, over the past decades, the local dialects have lost ground to German and French. Historically, in Aubel, Baelen, Plombi√®res, Welkenraedt (neighbouring Belgian municipalities), Eupen, Kelmis and Lontzen, the local languages have been classed as Limburgish, thus dialects of Low Franconian or Dutch. The inhabitants of Raeren have spoken Ripuarian and those of the district of Sankt Vith Moselle Franconian, which are dialects of High German. On the other hand, most of the people living in Malmedy and Waimes speak Walloon or French, with a minority of German speakers. Some of the folklore and carnival traditions there are still in the Walloon language. That is also the case for the children: > \\"The New Year's wishes have hardly been uttered when the children start > going round from house to house in order to celebrate the three kings. The > individual groups sing a song at the doors and demand a ‚Äúl√¥tire‚Äù for their > efforts, in other words a small sweetmeat. They sing in Walloon and say that > the kings have sent them.\\"'The Feast of Epiphany The East Cantons as a whole should therefore not be confused with the German language region created in 1963 or with the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which does not include the (smaller) Malmedy and Waimes areas.  Current administration  Modern view of the townhall of Malmedy, flying the Belgian flag. After becoming part of Belgium in the 1920s, the municipalities composing these territories were grouped into the three cantons of Eupen, Malmedy, and Sankt Vith. The administration was overhauled during the local government reforms of 1976‚Äì77, and are now administered as follows: ;Canton of Eupen: *Eupen: Eupen and Kettenis *Kelmis (in French La Calamine): Kelmis, Neu-Moresnet and Hergenrath *Moresnet: Lontzen and Walhorn *Raeren: Raeren, Eynatten and Hauset ;Canton of Sankt Vith: *Sankt Vith (in French Saint-Vith): Sankt Vith, Crombach, Lommersweiler, Sch√∂nberg and Recht *B√ºtgenbach (in French Butgenbach): B√ºtgenbach and Elsenborn *B√ºllingen (in French Bullange): B√ºllingen, Manderfeld and Rocherath *Amel (in French Ambl√®ve): Amel, Heppenbach and Meyerode *Burg-Reuland: and ;Canton of Malmedy: *Malmedy: Malmedy, B√©verc√© and Bellevaux-Ligneuville *Waimes (in German Weismes): Waimes, Faymonville and Robertville Linguistically, the Canton of Malmedy is mostly Francophone while the Cantons of Eupen and Sankt Vith are mostly Germanophone. When the three language-based communities of Belgium were created as part of the Belgian state reforms, Malmedy was placed in the French-speaking Community and Eupen and Sankt Vith were placed in the German- speaking Community. All the 11 municipalities of the East Cantons are \\"municipalities with language facilities\\", with the nine Germanophone municipalities also offering services in French and the two Francophone municipalities also offering services in German.

According to the author of The Video Game Explosion, Beast combined elements from block-pushing games and turn-based ASCII games into an action game that \\"has inspired a cult following even today\\". The game is an example of the \\"trap-em-up\\" genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien (1979), Space Panic (1980), and Lode Runner (1983). Gameplay Gameplay The object of this arcade-like game is to survive through a number of levels while crushing \\"beasts\\" (represented by the character ‚îú‚î§) with movable blocks. The H's are attracted to the player's position, represented by a \\"diamond-like\\" character ‚óÑ‚ñ∫, every move. The player can control the diamond-shaped character by using the arrow keys or the numeric keypad to move around and/or push blocks. While the normal green block is movable, the yellow static block cannot be pushed or pulled. In the advanced levels, static blocks also become \\"explosive\\", which means that the player will lose a life by moving into one. The beginning levels have only common beasts (\\"‚îú‚î§\\"), but more challenging \\"super-beasts\\", represented by \\"‚ïü‚ï¢\\", appear as the player advances through levels. \\"Super-beasts\\" are harder to kill as they must be crushed against a static block. At even more advanced levels eggs appear that eventually hatch into \\"hatched beasts\\" (‚ï¨‚ï¨) with the ability to move blocks to crush the player. A two-player mode is also available in which the second player controls a character using WASD keys. Reception A review of Beast in the 1988 book Public-domain Software and Shareware noted that the game had \\"original concepts\\" but the author admitted that \\"I don't completely understand this game\\". In a retrospective review of \\"classic\\" ASCII games, PC Magazine described Beast as \\"so simple yet so replayable\\" and \\"stressful at times, but always fun\\". In his book The Video Game Explosion, scholar Mark Wolf noted that Beast resembled earlier block- pushing games like Sokoban and ASCII text games like Rogue, but advanced beyond both of those games by introducing \\"freeform, real-time spatial control\\" into a block-moving action game with \\"a level of fluidity that is unexpectedly effective\\".

Temple (formerly the Washington Temple) is the 18th constructed and 16th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church). It is located in Kensington, Maryland, United States, just north of Washington, D.C., near the Capital Beltway. The temple was dedicated in 1974 after an open house that attracted over 750,000 people, including several international dignitaries. The temple was the first temple built by the church east of the Mississippi River since 1846, when the original Nauvoo Temple was dedicated. Built at a cost of about $15 million in 1968, the temple is the church's tallest; its easternmost spire is tall. Its floor area of is the third-largest among church temples. Its design emulates the Salt Lake Temple with six spires, three on each end, and the building is encased in white Alabama marble. It also has a visitors' center. The architecture and highly visible location of the temple along the Capital Beltway has made the temple a local landmark in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. History The temple and its surroundings Plans to build the temple were announced on November 15, 1968; a groundbreaking ceremony was held on December 7. Clearing of the land started May 28, 1971. The site chosen for the temple was a wooded hill purchased in 1962 just north of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495). Only of the site was cleared to give the area a more remote feeling. It was the first LDS temple since 1846 in the United States east of the Mississippi River and remained the only LDS temple in eastern North America until the dedication of the Atlanta Georgia Temple in 1983. At the time of the temple's completion, its district included all Latter-day Saint members in 31 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, seven Canadian provinces, Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. Original cost estimates for the temple were about $15 million. Members of the church within the temple's attendance district were asked to contribute at least $4.5 million. Eventually, local members donated around $6 million for the temple's construction. Front view with main entrance At a completion ceremony the church's First Presidency buried a metal box with historical items near a corner of the temple. During the first week of the temple open house, government officials and diplomats from around the world were taken on special tours through the temple. The open house continued for seven weeks and over 750,000 people went through the temple. The high number of people that attended the open house was attributed to the large amount of coverage that the temple and church received as the temple neared completion. Articles about the temple were printed in Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report. There was also a large press conference held that introduced the temple and church president Spencer W. Kimball. Demand for tickets to the open house was high and the tickets were gone before the first day of tours; times were extended to accommodate more people. Ten dedicatory sessions were held for the Washington D.C. Temple between November 19 and 22, 1974. Over 40,000 members attended the dedicatory services. During the 5.8 magnitude 2011 Virginia earthquake on August 23, 2011, the temple sustained minor damage to some parts of the exterior. The tops of four spires were knocked off and fell to the ground, as were several pieces of marble from the building's facade. No significant damage was reported to the temple's interior or to the neighboring visitor center. Repairs were made beginning in September of that year and no disruptions occurred in the temple's normal operating schedule. The temple closed in March 2018 for renovations to upgrade the mechanical systems and update finishes and furnishings. The renovations are anticipated to be completed in 2020 and the adjacent visitor center is scheduled to be operational throughout the renovation. In February 2020, the church announced that with renovations nearing completion, a public open house would be held from September 24 through October 31, 2020, with the temple scheduled for rededication on Sunday, December 13, 2020. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the church announced on June 17, 2020 that the open house and rededication dates would be postponed until large public gatherings are determined to be safe.Washington D.C. Temple Open House and Rededication Dates Postponed, Newsroom, churchofjesuschrist.org, 17 June 2020. Retrieved 17 June 2020. =Presidents= Notable presidents of the temple include Franklin D. Richards (1983‚Äì1986); David S. King (1990‚Äì1993); F. Melvin Hammond (2005‚Äì2008); and Earl C. Tingey (2008‚Äì2011). Architecture Model of the temple's interior The Washington D.C. Temple, designed by architect Keith W. Wilcox, was built with a modern six-spire design based on the design of the Salt Lake Temple, with the three towers to the east representing the Melchizedek priesthood, and the three towers to the west representing the Aaronic priesthood. The temple was designed to be similar in style and form to the Salt Lake Temple so that it would be easily recognized as a temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The central eastern tower reaches a height of , the tallest of any temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The temple has a total floor area of , making it the third- largest church temple. The temple includes six ordinance rooms and fourteen sealing rooms. The Washington D.C. Temple's angel Moroni statue, which sits atop the tallest tower, is tall and weighs 2 tons. The outer walls are covered in white Alabama marble and the spires are coated in 24-carat gold. There are two large stained glass windows on the eastern and western-most spires. Although there appear to be no other windows, the marble was shaved to thick over window openings, thin enough to be translucent. Location Temple as seen from the Outer Loop of the Capital Beltway The temple is located in suburban Kensington, Maryland, north of Washington, D.C. It is accessible mainly from the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) exit 33, but also via the Red Line of the Washington Metro through a limited free shuttle service to and from the Forest Glen station. The look and white color of the Washington D.C. Temple, coupled with its location near the Capital Beltway has made it a local landmark. D.C.-area traffic reports often refer to the \\"Mormon temple\\" or \\"the temple\\". Sometime after the temple was constructed, an unknown person painted \\"Surrender Dorothy\\" on the girders of a railroad bridge that crosses the Beltway; to drivers approaching the temple from the east, the words appeared like a caption under the building.John Kelly, \\"'Surrender Dorothy' painted on a Beltway overpass ‚Äî what‚Äôs the story?\\", Washington Post, June 24, 2011. The Maryland State Police removed the message, which has been repainted from time to time. Church newsletters have cited the graffiti as an example of misconceptions about their religion, although local members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints generally find the re-appearing inscription amusing rather than offensive. Festival of Lights Festival of Lights at the Washington D.C. Temple, 2014Since 1978 the temple has annually hosted the Festival of Lights at the visitors' center, officially running from December 2 to January 1. The event attracts thousands of visitors who come to view millions of lights on the temple grounds. The festival features live performances by the Mormon Choir of Washington, D.C.; a public lighting ceremony; a narrated outdoor nativity scene; and nightly performances from various regional artists and musicians. Each year, a different ambassador to the United States is invited as a guest speaker at the festival's opening lighting ceremony. For example, in 2011, J. W. \\"Bill\\" Marriott, Jr. and his wife, Donna, hosted Brazilian Ambassador to the United States Mauro Vieira, with L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles presiding.

She is an ensemble member of the Lookingglass Theatre Company, the Manilow Resident Director at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, and also serves as the Jaharis Family Foundation Professor of Performance Studies at Northwestern University. She is currently a faculty member in the Performance Studies department at Northwestern. She has earned national and international recognition in the form of numerous awards, including the prestigious John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Fellowship (1998). She has received more than 20 Joseph Jefferson Awards for her creative work in the Chicago Area and won a 2002 Tony Award for Best Direction for her adaptation of Ovid‚Äôs Metamorphoses. Other notable productions include Eleven Rooms of Proust and The Secret in the Wings. Early life and education Although Zimmerman was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, she spent much of her childhood in Europe, splitting time between her parents‚Äô home outside London in Hampstead Garden, England, and in Paris. Both of her parents were academics at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, her father a physics professor and her mother a professor of comparative literature who studied the author George Sand. Zimmerman studied theatre and performance studies at Northwestern University, where she received a BS in theatre (1982) in addition to an MA (1985) and PhD (1994) in performance studies. Director, librettist, and producer Zimmerman's involvement in stage productions is difficult to categorize, since she may be billed as director, writer, or producer, but usually takes on several of these roles. She is well known for her revivals of old plays and re-adaptions of classical and pre-classical works, librettos for modern operas, and re-presenting modern film and novels as stage plays. =Play productions= Zimmerman has directed several theatrical adaptations of literary works in addition to Metamorphoses, including Journey to the West, the Odyssey, Silk, Arabian Nights (1994), and The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (2003). In 2004 she directed a production of Pericles, Prince of Tyre at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. Her production was re-staged in 2006 at the Shakespeare Theatre Company Free For All. The following year, Zimmerman directed another Shakespeare play, Cymbeline, at Northwestern University. In 2006 she directed a version of the Greek story of Jason and the Argonauts‚Äô search for the Golden Fleece, Argonautika, at the Lookingglass Theatre Company, and then toured it at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2007, and at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. in 2008.Hernandez, Ernio.Zimmerman's Argonautika Makes West Coast Debut at Berkeley Rep Nov. 2 , playbill.com, 2 November 2007\\"Zimmerman on Argonautika\\", Shakespeare Theatre Company, accessed 7 February 2011 In 2017, Zimmerman directed her adaption of Homer‚Äôs Odyssey at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. In 2018, Zimmerman adapted and directed Hans Christian Andersen's The Steadfast Tin Soldier at Lookingglass Theatre Company. The production was remounted the following year. In July 2019, \\"Treasure Island: A Play\\"--Zimmerman's adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\"-- was published by Northwestern University Press. =Opera productions= She has also worked in opera production. She is the director and co-librettist of the 2002 opera Galileo Galilei, music by Philip Glass, commissioned by the Goodman Theatre. In 2007 Zimmerman directed the first of a series of new productions for the Metropolitan Opera: She was engaged to stage a new production of Donizetti‚Äôs Lucia di Lammermoor starring Natalie Dessay, which opened the company's 2007‚Äì2008 season. The production received mixed reviews, but was a success at the box office. Zimmerman's Lucia was revived in 2008‚Äì2009 with Diana Damrau and Anna Netrebko as Lucia.

Vienna: ZKF Publishers, 2007: 129-143. . was a Tuscarora artist and the author of David Cusick‚Äôs Sketches of Ancient History of the Six Nations (1828). This is an early (if not the first) account of Native American history and myth, written and published in English by a Native American. Biography David Cusick was born around 1780, probably on the Oneida reservation in upstate New York. His father, Nicholas Cusick, was a Revolutionary War veteran and an interpreter for the Congregationalist mission to the Seneca. David's younger brother, Dennis Cusick, was a watercolor painter, and together the two brothers help establish the early Iroquois Realist Style of painting. David served in the War of 1812, during which his village was burned by the British. David was a physician, painter and student of Iroquois oral tradition. He published the first edition of Sketches of Ancient History of the Six Nations as a 28-page pamphlet at Lewiston, NY, in 1827. He re-issued it the following year with additional text and four of his own engravings. Cusick is thought to have died around 1840. The Sketches was republished in 1848 and again in 1892. Book Flying head terrified of woman cooking and eating acorns The history begins at the Creation, with the twin brothers Enigorio and Enigonhahetgea (the good spirit and evil spirit) and their creatures, the Eagwehoewe (the people) and their enemies the Ronnongwetowanca (giants). The earliest people were championed by the hero Donhtonha and the less heroic Yatatonwatea and plagued by the mischievous Shotyeronsgwea. These early people were also threatened by (but survived) the Big Quisquiss or mammoth, the Big Elk, the great Emperor who resided at the Golden City to the south, the great horned serpent of Lake Ontario, and the blazing star that fell. More recently, the creation was renewed and restored, and the Six Nations situated and intermittently rescued by the intervention of Tarenyawagon, the Holder of the Heavens. The Five Nations were a confederacy, or Ggoneaseabneh (Long House), consisting of the # Teakawrehhogeh or Tehawrehogeh (Mohawks) # Newhawtehtahgo or Nehawretahgo (Oneidas) # Seuhnaukata or Seuhnowkahtah (Onondagas) # Shoneanawetowah (Cayugas) # Tehooneanyohent or Tehowneanyohent (Senecas) They were later joined by the Kautanohakau (Tuscaroras) to make the Six Nations. Their human enemies at times included the Sohnourewah (Shawnees), Twakanhahors (Mississaugers), Ottauwahs, Squawkihows, Kanneastokaroneah (Eries), Ranatshaganha (Mohegans), Nay-Waunaukauraunah, and Keatahkiehroneah. Their monstrous enemies included the Konearaunehneh (Flying Heads), the Lake Serpent, the Otneyarheh (Stonish Giants), the snake with the human head, the Oyalkquoher or Oyalquarkeror (the Big Bear), the great musqueto, Kaistowanea (the serpent with two heads), the great Lizard, and the witches introduced by the Skaunyatohatihawk or Nanticokes. Important figures in the history include Atotarho I, first king of the Five Nations, his successors Atotarho II‚ÄìXIII, the war chiefs Shorihowane and Thoyenogea, Sauwanoo, Queen Yagowanea, and the allied or friendly Dog Tail Nation and the Kauwetseka. Cusick gives particular attention to geographical details, including the Kanawage or St. Lawrence River, Yenonanatche or Mohawk River, Shawnaytawty or Hudson River, Ouauweyoka or Mississippi River, Onyakarra or Niagara River, Kaunsehwatauyea or [Susquehanna River], Kuskehsawkich or Oswego Falls, Jenneatowake or Canandaigua Lake, Kauhagwarahka or Lake Erie, Goyogoh or Cayuga Lake, Geatahgweah or Chatatique Lake, and the forts at Kedauyerkawau (now Torewanta plains), Kauhanauka, and the village of Kaunehsuntahkeh. Cusick‚Äôs Sketches of Ancient History of the Six Nations has been proposed as a possible source for or influence on the Book of Mormon; it has also been advanced as evidence for the existence of Bigfoot and the Lake Champlain monster.

The story occurs as a multiply-embedded narrative in the Mahabharata as told by sage Markandeya. When Yudhishthira asks Markandeya whether there has ever been a woman whose devotion matched Draupadi‚Äôs, Markandeya replies by relating this story. Story Savitri begs Yama for Satyavan's life. The childless king of Madra Kingdom, Ashwapati, lives ascetically for many years and offers oblations to Sun God Savitr. His consort is Malavika. Finally, pleased by the prayers, God Savitr appears to him and grants him a boon: he will soon have a daughter. The king is joyful at the prospect of a child. She is born and named Savitri in honor of the god. Savitri is born out of devotion and asceticism, traits she will herself practice. Savitri is so beautiful and pure, she intimidates all the men in the vicinity. When she reaches the age of marriage, no man asks for her hand, so her father tells her to find a husband on her own. She sets out on a pilgrimage for this purpose and finds Satyavan, the son of a blind king named Dyumatsena of Shalwa Kingdom; Dyumatsena lost everything including his sight, and lives in exile as a forest-dweller with his wife and son. Savitri returns to find her father speaking with Sage Narada who announces that Savitri has made a bad choice: although perfect in every way, Satyavan is destined to die one year from that day. In response to her father‚Äôs pleas to choose a more suitable husband, Savitri insists that she will choose her husband but once. After Narada announces his agreement with Savitri, Ashwapati acquiesces. Savitri and Satyavan are married, and she goes to live in the forest. Immediately after the marriage, Savitri wears the clothing of a hermit and lives in perfect obedience and respect to her new parents-in-law and husband. Three days before the foreseen death of Satyavan, Savitri takes a vow of fasting and vigil. Her father-in-law tells her she has taken on too harsh a regimen, but Savitri replies that she has taken an oath to perform these austerities, to which Dyumatsena offers his support. The morning of Satyavan‚Äôs predicted death, Savitri asks for her father-in-law‚Äôs permission to accompany her husband into the forest. Since she has never asked for anything during the entire year she has spent at the hermitage, Dyumatsena grants her wish. They go and while Satyavan is splitting wood, he suddenly becomes weak and lays his head in Savitri‚Äôs lap. Servants of Yama the god of Death come and return without the soul of Satyavan due to Savitri's holiness.Then Yama himself comes to claim the soul of Satyavan. Savitri follows Yama as he carries the soul away. When he tries to convince her to turn back, she offers successive formulas of wisdom. First she praises obedience to Dharma, then friendship with the strict, then Yama himself for his just rule, then Yama as King of Dharma, and finally noble conduct with no expectation of return. Impressed at each speech, Yama praises both the content and style of her words and offers any boon, except the life of Satyavan. She first asks for eyesight and restoration of the kingdom for her father-in-law, then a hundred children for her father, and then a hundred children for herself and Satyavan. The last wish creates a dilemma for Yama, as it would indirectly grant the life of Satyavan. However, impressed by Savitri's dedication and purity, he offers one more time for her to choose any boon, but this time omitting \\"except for the life of Satyavan\\". Savitri instantly asks for Satyavan to return to life. Yama grants life to Satyavan and blesses both of them to attain life of four hundred years. Satyavan awakens as though he has been in a deep sleep and returns to his parents along with his wife. Meanwhile, at their home, Dyumatsena regains his eyesight before Savitri and Satyavan return. Since Satyavan still does not know what happened, Savitri relays the story to her parents-in-law, husband, and the gathered ascetics. As they praise her, Dyumatsena‚Äôs ministers arrive with news of the death of his usurper. Joyfully, the king and his entourage return to his kingdom. Savitri In popular culture Yama and Savitri, by Nandalal Bose, 1913 In Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha, married women observe Savitri Brata on the Amavasya (new moon) day in the month of Jyestha every year. This is performed for the well-being and long life of their husbands. A treatise entitled Savirti Brata Katha in the Odia language is read out by women while performing the puja. In Western India, the holy day is observed on the Purnima (full moon) of the month as Vat Purnima. It is believed that Savitri got her husband back on the first day of the Tamil month Panguni. So, this day is celebrated as Karadayan Nonbu in Tamil Nadu. On this day, married women and young girls wear yellow robes and pray to Hindu goddesses for long lives for their husbands. Girls start this practice at a very young age; they wear a yellow robe on this day from the time they are a year old so they will find a good husband in future. In 1950 and 1951, Sri Aurobindo published his epic poem in blank verse titled \\"Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol\\". In England, Gustav Holst composed a chamber opera in one act in 1916, his Opus 25, named Savitri based on this story.Head, Raymond, \\"Holst and India (III)\\" (September 1988). Tempo (New Ser.), 166: pp. 35‚Äì40 There have been about thirty-four film versions of the Savitri/Satyavan story produced. One of the earliest is the silent film, Satyavan Savitri (1914) directed by Dadasaheb Phalke. In 1937, Savitri was produced in Hindi directed by Franz Osten. The 1923 version, Savitri also called Satyavan Savitri, was an Italian co-production directed by Giorgio Mannini and J. J. Madan produced by Madan Theatres Ltd and Cines. Savitri (1933) was the first film produced by the East India Film Company. Directed by C. Pullaiah, it received an Honorary Certificate at the Venice Film Festival. In India, many women are named \\"Savitri\\". Many films made in South India center on this story. Telugu language film versions of the story have been made since the beginning of talkies, in 1933, 1957, 1977 and 1981. Sati Savitri (1932) was the second talkie Gujarati film. The Tamil-language films Doctor Savithri (1955) and Roja (1992) are contemporary adaptations of the story of Savitri and Satyvan. The Husband-Wife New Age Group 2002 released an album inspired by the story of Savitri and Satyavan in 1995.http://www.2002music.com/music/cds-dvds/savitri/ See also * Pativrata  References   Further reading  * The Mahabharata vol. 2, tr.

The subject touches on many other elements of American history such as that of changing U.S. education, with Greater education attainment leading to expanding household incomes for many social groups. The overall level of prosperity grew greatly in the U.S. through the 20th century as well as the 21st century, anchored in changes such as growing American advances in science and technology with American inventions such as the phonograph, the portable electric vacuum cleaner, and so on. Yet much of the debate has focused lately on whether social mobility has fallen in recent decades as income inequality as risen, what scholars such as Katherine S. Newman have called the \\"American nightmare.\\" For most of American history, social class barriers were fundamentally rigid, with various private and public institutions enforcing rules based on racial segregation and other forms of classifying people based on prejudices such as antisemitism and Hispanophobia. All this changed greatly with the rise of broad-based prosperity in the aftermath of World War II and efforts to expand Constitutional civil rights under the law to groups such as African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Issues regarding social class have remained hot-button topics in U.S. politics, with the American Great Recession causing massive socio-economic harm across the country from southerners to northerners to working-class whites to middle-class blacks Colonial period Historians in recent decades have explored in microscopic detail the process of settling the new country and creating the social structure. =Southern colonies= The main themes have been the class system of the plantation South. These include the plantation masters and their families, as typified by the Byrd family. The plantation elite in gen regions of the Chesapeake, with some attention to South Carolina as well. The region had very few urban places apart from Charleston, where a merchant elite maintained close connections with nearby plantation society. It was a goal of prosperous merchants, lawyers and doctors in Charleston to buy lands and retire as country gentlemen. Charleston supported diverse ethnic groups, including Germans and French, as well as a free black population. Beyond the plantations yeoman farmers operated small holdings, sometimes with a slave or two. Missionaries commented on their lack of religiosity. The plantation areas of Virginia were integrated into the vestry system of the established Anglican church. By the 1760s a strong tendency to emulate British society was apparent in the plantation regions. However the growing strength of republicanism created a political ethos that resisted imperial taxation without local consent. Led by Virginia, the Southern Colonies resisted the British policy of taxation without representation, and supported the American Revolution, sending wealthy planters George Washington to lead the armies and Thomas Jefferson to declare the principles of independence, as well as thousands of ordinary folk to man the armies.Jack P. Greene, and J. R. Pole, eds. A Companion to the American Revolution (2004), pp 195-234 19th century =Frontier= Historian Frederick Jackson Turner had a frontier based theory. The frontier itself was egalitarian as land ownership was available to all free men. Second deference faded away as frontiersmen treated each other as equals. Third the frontiersmen forced new levels of political equality through Jefferson Democracy and Jacksonian Democracy. Finally the frontier provided a safety valve whereby discontented easterners could find their own lands. Historians now agree that few Eastern city people went to the frontier, but many farmers did so; before 1850 the America had few cities, which were mostly small, and the vast majority of people were rural. According to the Turner model, the social structure of the East was similar to the familiar European class-based structure, while the West increasingly became more socially, politically, and economically equal. =The Plain Folk of the Old South= Frank Lawrence Owsley in Plain Folk of the Old South (1949) redefined the debate by starting with the writings of Daniel R. Hundley who in 1860 had defined the Southern middle class as \\"farmers, planters, traders, storekeepers, artisans, mechanics, a few manufacturers, a goodly number of country school teachers, and a host of half-fledged country lawyers, doctors, parsons, and the like.\\" To find these people Owsley turned to the name-by-name files on the manuscript federal census. Owsley argued that Southern society was not dominated by planter aristocrats, but that yeoman farmers played a significant role in it. The religion, language, and culture of these common people created a democratic \\"plain folk\\" society. In his study of Edgefield County, South Carolina, Orville Vernon Burton classified black society into the poor, the yeoman middle class, and the elite.Orville Vernon Burton, In My Father's House Are Many Mansions: Family and Community in Edgefield, South Carolina (U. of North Carolina Press, 1985) A clear line demarcated the elite, but according to Burton, the line between poor and yeoman was never very distinct. Stephanie McCurry argues, yeomen were clearly distinguished from poor whites by their ownership of land (real property). Yeomen were \\"self-working farmers,\\" distinct from the elite because they worked their land themselves alongside any slaves they owned. Ownership of large numbers of slaves made the work of planters completely managerial.Stephanie McCurry, Masters of Small Worlds: Yeoman Households, Gender Relations, and the Political Culture of the Antebellum South Carolina Low Country (1995) =Minorities = African Americans The study of slavery as a social and economic system dates from Ulrich B. Phillips in the early 20th century. He argued that plantation slavery was a school for civilizing the blacks, albeit one that produced no graduates. His favoritism toward the slave owners was finally challenged by neoabolitionist historians in the 1950s, most notably Kenneth Stampp. Since the 1960s a large literature has emerged on the social structure of the slave system, especially on such topics as family life, gender roles, resistance to slavery, and demographic trends. The study of free blacks has been slower to emerge because of the shortage of records, but historians have been filling in the picture North and South with studies of free black urban communities, and their religious and political leaders. The post-slavery era has been dominated by political studies, especially of Reconstruction and Jim Crow. The black churches were not only a political force, but became central to the black community in both urban and rural areas. The emergence of a black musical culture has been linked both to slavery (as in the Blues), and to church music. Asian Americans Asian Americans had small communities in New York City before 1860. Their greatest growth came on the Pacific Coast, during the Gold Rush and railroad booms of the 1860s. The Chinese who remained in America were violently driven out of the mining and railroad camps, and largely forced into Chinatowns in the larger cities, especially San Francisco. The Chinese exclusion laws of the 1880s created special legal problems, which numerous have explored. The Chinatowns were over 90% male, augmented by a trickle of immigration, and slowly shrank in size until 1940. Local and national attitudes became much more favorable to the Chinese after 1940, largely because of American support for China in World War II. Japanese immigration was a major factor in the history of Hawaii, and after its annexation in 1898 large numbers moved to the West Coast. Anti-Japanese hostility was strong down to 1941, when it intensified and most Japanese on the West Coast were sent to relocation camps, 1942-44. After 1945 the trickle of immigration from the Philippines, India and Korea grew steadily, creating large communities on the West Coast. Hispanics In 1848 after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the annexation of Texas and the Southwest introduced a Hispanic population that had full citizenship status. About 10,000 Californios lived in the southern part of California, and were numerically overwhelmed by migrants form the East by 1900 that their identity was almost lost. In New Mexico, by contrast, the Mexican population maintained its highly traditionalistic and religious culture, and retained some political power, into the 21st century. The Tejano population of Texas supported the revolution against Mexico in 1836, and gained full citizenship. In practice, however, most were ranch hands with limited political rights under the control of local bosses. =Industrial Northeast= The industrialization of the Northeast dramatically changed the social structure. New wealth abounded, with the growth of factories, railroads, and banks from the 1830 to the 1920s. Hundreds of small cities sprang up, together with 100 large cities (of 100,000 or more population by 1920). Most had a base in manufacturing. The urban areas came to have a complex class structure, compounded of wealth (the more the better), occupation (with the learned professions at the top), and family status (the older the better). Ethnic-religious groups had their separate social systems (such as German Lutherans and Irish Catholics). The New England Yankee was dominant in business, finance, education, and high society in most Northern cities, but gradually lost control of politics to a working class coalition led dominated by bosses and immigrants, including Irish Catholics. Hundreds of new colleges and academies were founded to support the system, usually with specific religious or ethnic identities. Heterogeneous state universities became important after 1920. =Ethnicity and social class= The most elaborate and in-depth studies of social class have focused on the working class, especially regarding occupation, immigration, ethnicity, family structure, education, occupational mobility, religious behavior, and neighborhood structure.Stephan Thernstrom, The Other Bostonians: Poverty and Progress in the American Metropolis, 1880-1970 (1973) Before 1970 historians emphasized the success, and the painful processes, of assimilation into American culture, as studied by Oscar Handlin. In recent decades the internal value systems have been explored, as well as the process of occupational mobility. Most of the studies have been localized (because of the need for the exhaustive use of censuses and local data) so that generalizations have been difficult to make. In recent years European scholars have become interested in the international flows so that there are now studies following people from Europe to America over their lifetimes. Labor historians have moved from a focus on national labor unions to microscopic studies of the workers in particular industries in particular cities. The consensus has been that the workers had their own political and cultural value system. The political values were based on a producer's ethic, that is the working class was the truly productive sector of society, and expressed a version of republicanism that was similar to the middle class version.Wilentz, Sean. The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln (2005)Wilentz, Sean. \\"On Class and Politics in Jacksonian America\\" Reviews in American History, Vol. 10, No. 4, The Promise of American History: Progress and Prospects (Dec., 1982) pp. 45-63 This enabled the businessman's party, the Republican party, to enjoy a strong base among Protestant blue collar workers, and prevented the emergence of a strong Socialist movement. 20th century The Progressive Era, with its emphasis on factualism and scientific inquiry produced hundreds of community studies, mostly using descriptive statistics to cover issues of poverty, crime, migration, religiosity, education, and public health. The emergence of systematic social science, especially sociology, shifted the center of class studies into sociology departments. The most representative example was the Middletown books by Robert Lynd and Helen Lynd, which gave a microscopic look at class structures in a typical small city (Muncie, Indiana). After 1960 localized studies gave way to national surveys, with special emphasis on the process of social mobility and stratification. A classic theme was trying to see if the middle class was shrinking, or if the opportunities for upward mobility had worsened over time. After 1960 a growing concern with education led to many studies dealing with racial integration, and performance in schools by racial and gender groupings. The disposable income of the American upper class was sharply reduced by high income tax rates during the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. During this period corporate executives had relatively modest incomes, lived modestly, and had few servants.

Through a combination of regional partnerships, community mobilization and legal advocacy the organization works to encourage governments to adopt, improve and enforce laws that protect and promote women and girls' rights around the world. Equality Now's four main issue areas are ending sexual violence, ending harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation, ending sexual exploitation including the trafficking of women and girls, and ending discrimination in law, including the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in the United States. As of 2019, the organization has offices in New York, United States, Nairobi, Kenya, London, United Kingdom, and Beirut, Lebanon. Gloria Steinem serves as the chair emeritus of the board.  Background and history  Equality Now was founded in 1992 in New York by attorneys Jessica Neuwirth of the United States, Navanethem Pillay of South Africa and Feryal Gharahi. The founders believed that acts of violence against women were violations of the fundamental human rights guarantees as stated in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that the human rights movement to that point had neglected women's rights, dismissing these violations as ‚Äúcultural‚Äù or ‚Äúprivate.‚Äù At the time, issues such as domestic violence, rape, female genital mutilation, trafficking, and reproductive rights were not part of the agendas of established human rights organizations. Neuwirth, Pillay and Gharahi envisioned an organization that would work closely with grassroots women's organizations in every region of the world, sharing and receiving information on the status of women and violations of their rights, and mobilizing public protest in response. Immediately after the opening of its first office in New York, Equality Now began to identify groups whose work matched its own mission and to consider how to support and reinforce the actions those groups were already taking. Equality Now helped to build public consciousness on women's rights as human rights and to channel concern into strategic action through the Women's Action Network, an alliance of organizations working to achieve their common goals. Supporters who joined the network received campaign briefings and were urged to take action against human rights violations against women and girls by writing letters of protest directly to government officials, sharing information about these violations within their communities and taking other steps to support the struggle to end violence and discrimination against women. The founders also hoped to build the organization's presence around the world by setting up offices in different regions. They hoped this would facilitate stronger relationships with the local groups and regional networks best places to know the most effective actions to be taken to end violence and discrimination against women and girls in their communities. Equality Now opened its Africa Regional Office in Nairobi, Kenya in 2000. A London office followed in 2004 and the organization opened its fourth office in Beirut in 2019. The organization also has additional outposts in Amman, Jordan, Tbilisi, Georgia, Delhi, India and Washington, DC. Vision and Mission  Equality Now's vision is \\"a world in which women and men have equal rights under the law, and full enjoyment of their human rights\\". Their mission is to \\"achieve legal and systemic change that addresses violence and discrimination against women and girls around the world\\". Areas of work  Equality Now works to achieve its mission of ending violence and discrimination against women and girls around the world across four broad areas: =Sexual Violence= Sexual violence is perpetrated around the world on girls and women of all ages and all backgrounds. Systemic and structural inequality leaves women and girls particularly vulnerable to sexual violence. Many countries have discriminatory laws around sexual violence, including: * a legal provision in Bolivia which imposes lesser penalties for perpetrators whose victims are between 14- and 18-years-old * 'marry-your- rapist' laws which exempt a rapist from punishment if they marry their victim, for example in Iraq * marital rape exemptions leaving women with no access to justice if they are raped by their husband, for example in India Equality Now works to end such violence by advocating for strong laws and practices in line with international standards, including non-discriminatory implementation, as well as legal systems that support survivors and prevent re-victimisation. = Harmful Practices = Harmful practices encompasses a range of violent acts or instances ritual discrimination that are primarily committed against women and girls and have become culturally normalized. Among the harmful practices Equality Now works to end are: *Child marriage Child marriage is defined as a formal marriage or informal union before the age of 18 and disproportionately affects girls around the world. Every year 12 million girls are married before the age of 18. It is a human rights violation that legitimizes abuse and denies girls' autonomy under the guise of culture, honor, tradition and religion. When young girls are forced to marry, they are essentially subject to state-sanctioned rape and are at risk of increased domestic violence, forced pregnancy and negative health consequences while being denied education and economic opportunity. *Female genital mutilation (FGM) It is estimated that more than 200 million girls and women around the world have undergone genital mutilation. At least two million girls are at risk every year. The cutting, which is generally done without anesthetic, may have lifelong health consequences including chronic infection, severe pain during urination, menstruation, sexual intercourse, and childbirth, and psychological trauma. Some girls die from the cutting, usually as a result of bleeding or infection. In November 2013, a coalition of Royal Colleges, trade unions and Equality Now launched a report at the House of Commons titled, ‚ÄúTackling FGM in the UK: Intercollegiate recommendations for identifying, recording and reporting.\\" In 2019, Equality Now joined with other organisations working to end FGM at the Women Deliver conference to launch the Global Platform to End FGM/C. Equality Now also sits on the steering committee of the U.S. End FGM/C Network. = Sexual Exploitation = Sexual exploitation is when someone abuses or attempts to abuse another person‚Äôs vulnerability or their own position of power or trust for sexual purposes. They may benefit from the exploitation of the other person through making money, political or social gains, or in other ways. Sexual exploitation occurs on a continuum that includes many forms of coercion and predatory actions including trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. International human rights law protects a person‚Äôs right to be free from exploitation. These treaties and standards include: * Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) * the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) * the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children (Palermo Protocol) * the Convention on the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others * the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) * the Beijing Platform for Action =Discrimination in law= The fight for civil and political rights, and for economic, social and cultural rights, all relate to the underlying struggle for justice and equality. Equality Now's work in this area addresses the organization's goal of reforming discriminatory laws and practices, and bringing justice and equality to women and girls. Equality Now leads and participates in a range of activities and campaigns that aim to hold governments accountable to the pledges they have made to protect the fundamental rights of women and girls around the world. Every five years since 1999 Equality Now has released their Words and Deeds report, highlighting a selection of the sex discriminatory laws still in place around the world. Their latest report was released in March 2020. Equality Now has expressed its outrage at the Donald Trump administration military trans exclusion memo.  Partnerships with The Handmaid's Tale  In June 2018, it was announced Equality Now would partner with Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale to release the Hope Lives In Every Name Campaign. At the time of the campaign's release, Handmaid's Tale executive producer Warren Littlefield said, ‚ÄúWe are honored to partner with Equality Now to help raise awareness of the vital work they do for women and girls around the world...Their efforts of addressing and helping correct inequality and injustice where it exists for girls and women especially resonates with the message of our show, and we are proud to be part of this campaign.‚Äù One year later, in June 2019, Equality Now unveiled its second partnership with The Handmaid's Tale, The World I Want To Live In, which ran in tandem the series' third season in the U.S. and the U.K. In August 2019, Equality Now revealed the organization had been selected as the official charity partner for the release campaign of Margaret Atwood's novel The Testaments, the highly anticipated sequel to The Handmaid's Tale. In a statement, Equality Now said they were \\"honored\\" to serve as the event's charity partner and went on to say, \\"The rollback of women‚Äôs rights is as relevant as ever, and we hope that this global movement around The Testaments continues the momentum to fight for gender equality around the world. Although Gilead and The Testaments are fictional, they hold a mirror up to the state of women‚Äôs rights today. Gilead depicts a dystopian future in which women are enslaved, married off, raped and denied their most fundamental human rights. The patriarchal and discriminatory practices of Gilead are the practices Equality Now tackles every day.\\" Through a statement, Atwood said she was \\"delighted\\" the events surrounding the novel's release would be working in partnership with the organization. Additional publications *In March 2020, Equality Now released \\"Words and Deeds: Holding Governments Accountable in the Beijing Review Process\\", highlighting sex discriminatory laws in place around the world. *In January 2019, Equality Now released \\"Roadblocks To Justice: How The Law Is Failing Survivors Of Sexual Violence In Eurasia.\\" The first report of its kind the report surveyed sexual violence laws in the 15 countries of the Soviet Union. *In May 2018, Equality Now released its report, \\"The State We're In: Ending Sexism In Nationality Laws.\\" The report, which documented the consequences of discriminatory nationality laws toward women was subsequently sent to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. *In February 2017, Equality Now published its report \\"The World's Shame: The Global Rape Epidemic - How Laws Around the World Are Failing To Protect Women and Girls From Sexual Violence \\" which looked at rape and sexual assault laws in 82 jurisdictions in 73 UN member states. *In 2016, Equality Now was among the organization that campaigned for a woman to be named UN Secretary-General. *in 2004, Equality Now launched a campaign against sex tourism companies Big Apple Oriental Tours and G.F.

Topography It is one of 'The Whitacres': Nether Whitacre, Over Whitacre and Whitacre Heath which are in the upper valley of the River Tame on its eastern side.Grid square map Ordnance survey website Its shape is roughly square with a north western outcrop (salient) largely covered by railway lines and lakes. Localities =Whitacre Heath= Whitacre Heath is built on the heath which was a mixture of common land and waste traditionally, partially useful for agriculture with the most fertile and well-drained land being in the village itself. Elevations range from 122m AOD in the east to 65m in the north-west corner of the parish. Land slopes from west to east with the eastern border being the slightly altered, early meander of the River Tame. =Botts Green= This is a hall and a few cottages. Half of the hamlet is in Nether Whitacre and half is in Over Whitacre. The hall itself in this parish is Grade II* listed for its architecture, which has its date of main construction inscribed and recorded which is 1593 (in the reign of Elizabeth I). Typical of manor houses and farmhouses of that era the main entrance gives access to a stone vaulted cross passage between the backs of 2 fireplaces. The kitchen fireplace to the south is plain but the massive fireplace in the main room has a Tudor arch and a frieze with shallow pilasters carved with fleur-de-lys above fluting. =Hoggrills End including Station Road= This southwestern part of the village is first a cluster of farms and cottages, four of which are c.1800 and listed (for two of which below, being made out of stone rather than brick). Beyond this is then a railway junction before becoming a developed residential, small linear development by the River Tame along station road. This stretch overlooks the Ladywalk Nature reserve on the opposite bank, beyond which is the Hams Hall National Distribution Park, used for storage of goods. It is bounded, to the south, by the Shustoke Reservoir To the southwest of this area is a fresh water treatment works, including for a Grade II listed Victorian pumping station, serving part of the region, Blythe End mill and to the west the Coleshill Industrial Park. History Church of St Giles =Early history= Objects belonging to much earlier Neolithic and Bronze Age times have been found in the soil. The village appears in Domesday where it is noted as already being held by Wulfric in the Saxon period.Domesday Map website By 1086, its eight households rendered only ¬£0.5 a year and its lord of the manor was Edwin who held under Thorkil of Warwick, its overlord, a relatively unusual name being strongly norse rather than a hybrid or Norman. It had an additional listing of one household, held under Robert of Vessey that rendered 2s (¬£0.1) a year. However, Whitacre was in the early medieval period recorded as 'Witecore', which still means 'white acre' thus 'white field'. Whitacre Hall, the manor house, perches next to the village on the northwestern slopes and is a double moated hall.Whitacre Hall ‚Äì Grade II ‚Äì The present structure dates from the Tudor period. At the height of the Industrial Revolution this was the home of the Jennens family, who were some of the early Ironmasters. John Jennens supplied Birmingham blacksmiths with iron bars and then sold their products. Church The Parish Church is St Giles's Church. It contains some 14th century glass and a 16th-century West Tower but most of the church is of 1870s restoration. The Parish Register dates from 1439, making it one of the earliest in the area. ;Rectory This was held with its advowson (right to name a priest) at least until 1545. In 1580, however, Sir John Throckmorton died holding it of the Queen as of the manor of East Greenwich. It passed to the Crown on the attainder of his Catholic son, Sir Francis Throckmorton, in 1584, thereafter for a few years held by John Cowper and William Kente. On 15 November 1589 the Queen granted the rectory to Sir Edward Stanley, but in 1594 it was conveyed by Ambrose and John Cowper to Edward Brabazon. By 1631 it had reunited with the advowson in the Earl of Meath's possession who in 1631 sold it and the manor to Sir John and Sir Robert King. =Post medieval era= Its extent has within it about half a dozen stone built buildings of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Church House,Church House ‚Äì Grade II ‚Äì the Old House and the Malthouse in Hoggrill End.Old House Malt House Nether Whitacre has a cricket club which was established officially in 1887. Four public houses in this area host an array of evening entertainments: *The Swan *The Railway *The Gate *The Dog All of these were established in the late 1800s. The hamlet of Furnace End, Over Whitacre probably derives its name from iron smelting furnaces owned by the Jennens. Charles Jennens was a friend of Handel, the composer. An Earl of Aylesford, the noble Finch family of Packington Hall in the county, was a cousin to the Jennens and obtained an organ for Handel, which was installed at Great Packington church.

The proposition was a ballot initiative to legalize medical marijuana which was approved by voters in 1996. Kubby himself is well-known as a cancer patient who relies on medical cannabis. He has authored two books on drug policy reform: The Politics of Consciousness, and Why Marijuana Should Be Legal. He was the Libertarian Party of California candidate for Governor of California in 1998 receiving 0.9% of the vote. In 2008, he declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination and received significant support for the nomination, but was eliminated after the second ballot. Although various media reports have described him as a \\"felon\\" and \\"fugitive\\", Kubby's legal status was resolved on July 3, 2008, when California Superior Court Judge, David Nelson, dismissed all charges against Kubby, clearing his name and record of any criminal activity. Cancer patient In 1968, at the age of 23, he began experiencing symptoms of hypertension and palpitations. He was diagnosed with malignant pheochromocytoma, a rare, fatal form of adrenal cancer. Kubby underwent surgery to remove a tumor in 1968, 1975 and 1976. This last time, his medical records show that the cancer had metastasised to his liver and beyond. All other patients with this diagnosis have had a 100% mortality rate within five years. His physician, Dr. Vincent DeQuattro, a specialist from the USC School of Medicine, monitored his condition and treated him with conventional therapies, including chemotherapy, until referring him to the Mayo Clinic in 1981 for yet another surgery and radiation. For the next 25 years, Kubby claimed to control the symptoms of his disease solely by smoking marijuana and by maintaining a healthy diet. His original doctor, an expert on this condition shocked to learn he was still alive, said, \\"In some amazing fashion, this medication has not only controlled the symptoms of the pheochromocytoma, but in my view, has arrested its growth.\\" Libertarian Party candidate In 1998, Kubby was the Libertarian candidate for Governor of California receiving 0.9% of the vote, and became national director of the American Medical Marijuana Association. Two months after the election, Kubby's home was raided by the Placer County sheriffs department. The officers seized 265 marijuana plants and a small quantity of peyote from a guest bedroom, and Kubby was arrested. Kubby was a contender to be the Libertarian Party's vice presidential candidate in the 2000 election. The Libertarian Party requires the vice presidential candidate to be nominated by the delegates just as the presidential candidate is selected. Kubby was opposed by fellow Californian Art Olivier, and by Ken Krawchuk of Pennsylvania. After no candidate received a majority on the first ballot, Krawchuk withdrew his name from the ballot and endorsed Olivier, who then defeated Kubby by a vote of 418 to 338. On August 20, 2006, at the Seattle Hempfest, Kubby announced his intention to seek the Libertarian Party's nomination for President in 2008. The Federal Election Committee (FEC) issued candidate ID numbers for Kubby personally and for the Kubby for President Committee on September 18, 2006. He had since campaigned at various community and Libertarian Party events and launched a campaign web site. He later endorsed Ron Paul for President, in the event that Ron Paul is able to secure the GOP nomination. Meanwhile, Kubby was continuing to actively campaign and has made Internet history with the first animated presidential campaign video. On May 25, 2008, Kubby did not gain his party's nomination and was eliminated after the second ballot at his party's national convention. Business ventures Cannabis Sativa, Inc. announced on June 30, 2014, that Kubby was named Chairman of the company. This was following Cannabis Sativa's acquisition of Kush Inc., previously owned by Kubby and the owner of the first patented marijuana plant. Arrest and trial In 1996, Kubby was instrumental in the drafting and passage of California Proposition 215, The Compassionate Use Act of 1996. Despite the victory of Prop. 215, Kubby and his wife, Michele, were arrested, jailed and prosecuted, under the false claim that the voter initiative provides only an affirmative defense and that it is to be used by only \\"seriously ill patients.\\" In the 1996 Voter's Handbook, the Official Title and Summary prepared by the Attorney General Dan Lungren, the State of California informed voters that a 'YES' vote on Prop. 215 would exempt patients and defined caregivers from criminal laws. In fact, the very first sentence of the official title and summary clearly states: \\"Exempts patients and defined caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician from criminal laws which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of marijuana.\\"CA Secretary of State - Vote96 - Proposition 215 Nowhere in the official Title and Summary does it say anything about an affirmative defense, or any limits or restrictions. Furthermore, in the official Analysis of Proposition 215 by the Legislative Analyst, the voters were told, \\"No prescriptions or other record-keeping is required by the measure.\\" In addition, the voters were reminded by the Legislative Analyst that this initiative also covered any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.\\"CA Secretary of State - Vote96 - Analysis of Proposition 215 The Placer County Sheriff's Department had been sent an anonymous letter alleging that the Kubby's had been operating a major grow operation from their residence, and began an investigation. Kubby learned of this, and invited them to inspect the grow room, by passing a note through his own household trash, which the police had begun searching. That note, \\" ... addressed to law-enforcement personnel, advising them of Steve Kubby's use of medicinal marijuana, maintenance of a garden, possession of no more than 3.5 pounds of pot and his cancer condition,\\" was removed from his trash and entered as evidence by the prosecution.US CA: MMJ: Kubbys Knew Of Impending Arrest In 1999, Kubby and his wife Michele were arrested and faced trial for growing his own cannabis in his home, though he was entitled to do so legally on behalf of himself and his wife, also a licensed cannabis patient. Calling his arrest the \\"Scopes monkey trial of medical marijuana,\\" Kubby remained defiant in his support of the Compassionate Use Act. He maintains that the prosecution was politically motivated, implicating then-Attorney General Dan Lungren's office. Lungren had been aggressive in resisting the implementation of Proposition 215, to the point of issuing instructions to peace officers on how to cross-examine cannabis patients so as to undermine their claim of sanction. In jail for 72 hours after the arrest, Kubby was deprived of medical marijuana and became seriously ill. His blood pressure shot up to dangerous levels. USC Medical Center's Dr. Vincent DeQuattro, who made Kubby's original diagnosis, wrote a letter to the court explaining Steve's condition and warning the judge what could happen if Steve was further deprived of cannabis. Kubby described their ordeal in his official complaint, Michele Kubby won an acquittal on all charges. Steve Kubby's trial, owing to one juror's refusal to acquit, received a mistrial on all the cannabis charges, which were eventually dropped. The jury also voted to convict on a possession charge involving a psilocybin mushroom stem and a few peyote buttons (a felony) found in their house. Kubby was sentenced to 120 days in jail. Flight to Canada In 2001, exercising his right to appeal the conviction for peyote possession, Kubby obtained the court's permission to move to Canada with his wife and two children. Kubby and his advisors were concerned that police and prosecutors were determined to prove their theory that he did not really need medical marijuana and would find a way to arrest and incarcerate him. After the Kubby family had been in Canada for a few months Kubby alleges the terms of his appeal were changed without his knowledge or consent by two judges. Kubby claims that he was wrongly reclassified as a fugitive. Kubby appealed his fugitive status through the Canadian legal system for five years. Among the arguments made in fighting the appeal was the likelihood that he would be denied access to cannabis in custody and risk death from his illness. This fear was later proved to be well founded as confirmed by the Placer Jail medical staff who found blood in his urine and other evidence of severe hypertensive trauma, which Kubby still suffers from, to this day. Dr. Joseph Michael Connors, an expert in the area of adrenal cancers, testified at the Canadian extradition hearing about Kubby's medical condition: Departure from Canada and incarceration in the US After numerous appeals, Kubby was asked to leave Canada under a \\"conditional Departure Order\\" within 30 days, which he did. He arrived in San Francisco, California, on Thursday, January 26, 2006, accompanied by his attorney Bill McPike, and was immediately arrested. Although it had been arranged that Kubby would surrender at the Placer Superior Court on Tuesday, 31 January, he was removed from the Alaska Airlines jet on arrival by San Francisco police officers at the request of sheriff's officials in Placer County and taken through secure areas of the airport, bypassing the supporters gathered to greet him. He was held in San Mateo County Jail in Redwood City, where, according to NORML spokesman Dale Gieringer, he was becoming rapidly ill. He was transported to Placer County Jail Friday afternoon and was arraigned at 1 p.m. in Dept. 13 of Placer County Superior court Tuesday, 31 January. Gieringer reports that Placer County Jail granted Kubby access to Marinol, a THC synthetic which lacks the cannabinoids which have been shown to modulate catecholamine levels. Kubby, with the Marinol, immediately went into cardiac arrest due to the lack of subsequent cannabinoids which modulated the known issues. Michele Kubby reported that the Marinol helped in specific quantities, but that her husband could tell subjectively that it will not be effective in the long run. She also describes her husband's conditions of confinement, In January, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution supporting Kubby and calling for his immediate release from jail. On March 6, 2006, Kubby was released early from jail for good behavior. At a March 14 hearing, he was re-sentenced to another 60 days in jail for violating his probation by not returning from Canada in 2001, and began serving the sentence on Wednesday, March 15. Kubby was released on April 5 after serving only 22 days of the 60-day sentence, his time reduced because of jail overcrowding. In July 2007, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP‚Äîthe drug czar's office) used testimony submitted to Congress to misrepresent the position of Kubby, claiming that he no longer supports medical marijuana. In written testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, Dr. David Murray, ONDCP's Chief Scientist called medical marijuana advocates \\"modern-day snake oil proponents,\\" sneered at medicines that make patients \\"feel good,\\" and claimed that laws okaying medical marijuana in a dozen states have led to \\"abuse, confusion, and crime.\\" Then, to further buttress his argument against the therapeutic use of the herb, he added: Kubby suffered from almost constant nausea while on Marinol, he wrote, adding that Murray took his sentence about Marinol out of context. The paragraph from which it was extracted reads as follows: \\"During that time I experienced excruciating pain, a vicious high blood-pressure crisis, passed blood in my urine and I lost 33 pounds. However, there was also good news. I learned that Marinol is an acceptable, if not ideal, substitute for whole cannabis in treating my otherwise fatal disease. Now I am a free man and I am profoundly grateful to be alive and to have friends and supporters such as you.\\" While conceding that Marinol can be effective for treatment of hypertension and would allow him to travel briefly without medical marijuana, it does not allow him to have an acceptable quality of life, Kubby said. \\"Please help me squash this deceptive and dangerous misrepresentation of my true feeling on this matter by the ONDCP,\\" Kubby wrote. \\"It just shows how desperate they are that they must mislead people in this way. And just so there is no question about this, let me be clear: Whole cannabis is not only the best medicine for me, it is the only medicine that has kept me alive during the 32 years that I have continued to live, in relatively good heath, despite a terminal diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma.\\" Political positions Kubby strongly supports the United States Constitution and civil liberties. He supports legal abortion, gay rights, gun rights, a non-interventionist foreign policy, immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from the war in Iraq, open borders, and the elimination of federal individual income tax. He opposes most governmental regulations, programs, and federal subsidies. He also opposes the War on drugs, Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act. During a 2009 interview with a New Jersey newspaper, he criticized the health care plan presented by President Barack Obama, saying: \\"Obama is ready to spend trillions of dollars to create a government health program. I have a far simpler plan that will genuinely help patients and save them and the government all those trillions of dollars: reschedule marijuana to reflect reality and authorize its use for medical purposes.\\" See also *Gonzales v.

History The first known photography in Norway dates from 1839, when Hans Th√∏ger Winther bought his first camera. The oldest image on file is one of his pictures from 1840. Daguerreotypes became popular in the 1840s, and several entrepreneurial photographers established studios in major cities for portrait photography and also took portable studios to smaller population centers. Winther published a number of articles on photography in newspapers and published a book in 1845 titled: :\\"Instructions on how in various ways to produce and establish IMAGES OF LIGHT on paper, such as portraits of living persons, prospects of nature, copies of paintings, plastic copper items, stone prints, leaves of plants, etc., partly by using a camera obscura, partly with an instrument for copying\\" Portrait photography became more affordable and commonplace throughout the 19th century, and around 1860 landscape photography took root in Norway. Marcus Selmer is considered to be the first landscape photographer with considerable production, but Knud Knudsen and the Swede Axel Lindahl made the most systematic efforts in traveling and capturing landscapes. From the late 19th century until World War I, photographers set up shop throughout Norway. Many women were among them. In 1901, Anders Beer Wilse returned from the United States. He became one of the most famous photographers in Norway. In addition to documenting natural landscapes and ethnology throughout Norway, he was also an accomplished portrait and architecture photographer. Although dominated primarily by German influences in the late 19th century, Pictorialism caught on in Norway when it did elsewhere in the world and was promoted by Oslo camera club, founded in 1921. Photographers whose work represent Norwegian pictorialism include Robert Collett, Aage Remfeldt, Thomas Blehr, and Waldemar Eide. Around World War I, portrait photography in Norway became more of an expressive art as a result of the work of Waldemar Eide, Dimitri Koloboff, Gunnar Theodor Sj√∏wall, Aage Remfeldt, Hans Johnsrud and Anders Beer Wilse. Craft Photojournalism In confluence with the growth of the socialist movement in Norway, the Neue Sachlichkeit movement also influenced Norwegian photography. With the rise of photojournalism, the ethnological legacy of Norwegian photography gave rise to a growing interest in making social and political commentary through the camera. Artistic expression In 1971, the first photographic work (by K√•re Kivij√§rvi) was accepted at the prestigious Autumn Exhibition in Oslo, marking the widespread acceptance of photography as an art form. Photographic archives Efforts to preserve photographic works in Norway is coordinated through the Norwegian Ministry of Culture, has been made the responsibility of the Norwegian Archive, Library and Museum Authority, the Preus Museum, and the National Library of Norway. Archives are funded through the Norwegian Cultural Council, public funding of related topical areas, and revenue generated by reproductions and other services. In 1928, the first initiative to create a national photographic archive was started through the formation of an iconographic commission. This was initially intended as a means to preserve historical visual records, but over time the interest increased in photographic archives that also preserved the craft, art, and technology of photography. In addition to central archives in the National Library's facilities and at the Preus Museum, there are 25 regional archives, organized by counties. A number of local libraries, museums, and other institutions also maintain photography archives.

Like most lambeosaurs, it would have been a primarily bipedal herbivore with a \\"duckbill\\" shaped snout and a hollow crest on top of its head, although such a crest has not been found. Fossil bones of adults are rare, but an adult would most likely have been at least long. According to Gregory S. Paul, it was about long and weighed about .Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 308 Discovery Skeletal restoration Russian paleontologists Yuri Bolotsky and Sergei Kurzanov first described and named this dinosaur in 1991. The generic name is derived from the Amur River and the Greek word sauros (\\"lizard\\"). The Amur (called Heilongjiang or \\"Black Dragon River\\" in Chinese) forms the border of Russia and China, and is near where this dinosaur's remains were found. There is one known species (A. riabinini), named in honor of the late Russian paleontologist Anatoly Riabinin, who conducted the first Russian expeditions to recover dinosaur remains in the Amur region in 1916 and 1917.Bolotsky, Y.L. & Kurzanov, S.K. 1991. [The hadrosaurs of the Amur Region.] In: [Geology of the Pacific Ocean Border]. Blagoveschensk: Amur KNII. 94-103. [In Russian] All fossils of Amurosaurus have been recovered from a single bonebed locality, discovered in 1984 within the city limits of Blagoveschensk in the Amur Oblast of far eastern Russia. This bonebed is found in the Udurchukan Formation, the oldest geologic formation in the Tsagayan Group of far eastern Russia and northeastern China. This formation is thought to belong to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, and was deposited about 68 million years ago, or just prior to the Lancian faunal stage of North America. The sediments were laid down in the floodplain of a river, which transported the fossils, but only a short distance, judging by the randomly assorted, disarticulated, but well-preserved bones within the bonebed, including fragile skull elements. Only a small section of the bonebed has been uncovered, but 90% of the remains found so far belong to lambeosaurines like Amurosaurus, mostly juveniles, with the rest belonging to other taxa, such as the hadrosaurine Kerberosaurus. Theropod teeth are also abundant, and there are many toothmarks on the bones, made by predators or scavengers. Restored skull The holotype, or original specimen, consists of only a maxilla (upper jaw bone), and a dentary (lower jaw bone), both from the left side of the same individual. However, most of the other bones of the skull and skeleton have also been preserved in the bonebed, albeit of many different individuals. This other material was described more recently, making Amurosaurus the most abundant and completely known Russian dinosaur.Godefroit, P., Bolotsky, Y.L., & Van Itterbeeck, J. 2004. The lambeosaurine dinosaur Amurosaurus riabinini, from the Maastrichtian of Far Eastern Russia. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 49(4): 585‚Äì618. Available online as PDF Description Amurosaurus is characterized by many autapomorphies, or unique features, of the skull, as well as the sigmoidal shape of the ulna (a lower arm bone) when viewed from the front or side. Most other known lambeosaurines have hollow crests on the top of their skulls, and although the bones that would make up such a crest are unknown in this dinosaur, the bones of the roof of the skull are modified to support one, so it can be assumed that Amurosaurus was crested as well. Classification Lower jaw of the holotype As most of its features were described recently, as of early 2006, Amurosaurus has only been subjected to one cladistic analysis, which placed it as a basal member of the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurs, but more derived than either Tsintaosaurus or Jaxartosaurus. All known basal lambeosaurines come from Asia, which has led to the hypothesis that lambeosaurines originated there and then later dispersed across the Bering Strait to North America. Two derived groups, the parasaurolophins (Parasaurolophus, Charonosaurus) and lambeosaurins (Corythosaurus, Nipponosaurus, Lambeosaurus, etc.) evolved later. As members of both groups are found in North America and Asia (And one from Europe, which one is not solidly known.), there must have been further dispersal after their evolution, although in which direction that dispersal occurred is still unclear.Suzuki, D., Weishampel, D.B., & Minoura, N. 2004.

Benson was a two time All-American at Indiana University, winning the 1976 Helms Foundation Player of the Year and helping lead the Hoosiers to the 1976 NCAA championship with a perfect 32-0 record, with Benson being named the 1976 NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player. Benson was the No. 1 overall pick of the 1977 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, playing 11 seasons in the NBA for Milwaukee (1977-1980), the Detroit Pistons (1980-1986), Utah Jazz (1986-1987) and Cleveland Cavaliers (1988). High school career Kent Benson attended New Castle Chrysler High School, located in New Castle, Indiana. He was named \\"Indiana Mr. Basketball\\" in 1973. He scored 1,496 points and had 1,585 rebounds in three varsity seasons playing for Coach Cecil Tague. College career Benson chose to attend Indiana University, located in Bloomington, Indiana, playing college basketball for Coach Bobby Knight. As a freshman, Benson averaged 9.3 points per game, while shooting 50.4 percent. He helped lead Indiana to the CCAT Championship, and to a 23‚Äì5 record and a Big Ten title. In his sophomore season (1974-1975), Benson helped lead the Hoosiers to an undefeated conference record (18‚Äì0) and on to an Elite Eight appearance, where they lost their only game of the season to Kentucky 92-90, despite 33 points and 23 rebounds from Benson. Helping lead the team to a 31‚Äì1 record on the season, Benson averaged 15 points and 8.9 rebounds a game. With seniors Quinn Buckner and Scott May, he helped lead Indiana to the 1976 national championship in a 1975-1976 season where the Hoosiers won every game they played, finishing 32-0. Benson was voted the 1976 NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player. The 1976 Indiana team is the most recent team to complete an undefeated campaign in Division I. Benson averaged 17.3 points and 8.8 rebounds a game on the season with his college season high of 57.8 percent from the field. He scored his career high of 38 points against Michigan State. In the 1976 NCAA tournament, Benson scored 20 points with 13 rebounds against St. John's in the 90-70 regional quarterfinal win; He scored 15 points and had five rebounds in the 74-69 sweet sixteen win over Alabama; In the Regional Final, he scored 18 points with 9 rebounds in the 65-56 win over Marquette; In the Final Four semi-final 65-51 victory against UCLA, Benson had 16 points and 9 rebounds; In the National Championship, he scored 25 points with 9 rebounds in the Hoosiers' 86-68 victory over Michigan. Of the undefeated 1975‚Äì76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team, Benson said, ‚ÄúIf the team wins, everybody wins. Coach Knight knew the potential that could be with that team. He molded us and made us a team.‚Äù After the perfect season during his junior year, \\"Benny\\" became the lone star for Indiana after May and Buckner both left after their senior years for the next level. He averaged 19.8 points and 10.4 rebounds a game his senior season. He led them to a 16‚Äì11 record, but Indiana received no post season appearance. Benson was named the Big Ten's 1977 Player of the Year, while also receiving All-American honors for the second straight season. Kent Benson ended his college career with 1,740 points (15.3) and 1,031 (9.0) rebounds, a 71.5% free throw and 53.6% field goal percentage. He is the third all-time rebounder in Indiana Hoosier history with 1,031 rebounds. Professional career After graduating from Indiana University in 1977, Benson was the number one overall draft pick of the 1977 NBA Draft by the Milwaukee Bucks. Two minutes into his very first game as a professional, Benson elbowed Los Angeles Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the abdomen, and Abdul-Jabbar broke Benson's jaw with a retaliatory punch. Abdul-Jabbar broke his hand in the incident and was out for two months; otherwise, he could have potentially been suspended by the NBA. (Meanwhile, Benson missed only one contest and was back in action four days later against Chicago, playing 24 minutes.) Benson never quite lived up to the potential of a number one NBA draft pick. Twice in his career, he was traded for a player that helped his former team get \\"over the hump\\" and contend for an NBA title. In 1980, the Bucks traded him to the Detroit Pistons for Bob Lanier, who would help the Bucks to consecutive Eastern Conference finals appearances in 1983 and 1984. In 1986, the Pistons traded him along with Kelly Tripucka to the Utah Jazz for Adrian Dantley, who would help lead the Pistons to the Eastern Conference finals in 1987 and the NBA Finals in 1988. Benson spent eleven seasons in the NBA with Milwaukee (1977-1980), Detroit (1980-1986), Utah (1986-1987) and Cleveland (1988). He averaged 9.1 points and 5.7 rebounds in 680 regular season games. He wore jersey #54 for his entire career. Benson played in Italy following his two-game tenure with Cleveland in 1988. He played one year in Italy before retiring. ‚ÄúI had prepared myself [to the leave the sport,]\\" he said. ‚ÄúI had an opportunity to stay and play in Italy for five more years. I actually walked away with two years left to go on my contract and just felt it was time to move on. Basketball was good to me and I was good to it, but I was ready to move on.‚Äù\\"> Personal After the NBA, Benson, worked for Kruse International, doing car auction commentary and The College Network, after working in life insurance and estate planning for 14 years. Benson has four daughters, Andrea, Ashley, Elizabeth and Gennie. Ashley played volleyball at Indiana University, where she was an All-American. She then became an assistant volleyball coach. Gennie, played volleyball at Vincennes University.

An EMU requires no separate locomotive, as electric traction motors are incorporated within one or a number of the carriages. An EMU is usually formed of two or more semi-permanently coupled carriages, but electrically powered single-unit railcars are also generally classed as EMUs. The great majority of EMUs are passenger trains, but versions also exist for carrying parcels and mail. EMUs are popular on commuter and suburban rail networks around the world due to their fast acceleration and pollution-free operation. Being quieter than diesel multiple units (DMUs) and locomotive-hauled trains, EMUs can operate later at night and more frequently without disturbing nearby residents. In addition, tunnel design for EMU trains is simpler as no provision is needed for exhausting fumes, although retrofitting existing limited-clearance tunnels to accommodate the extra equipment needed to transmit electric power to the train can be difficult. History Multiple unit train control was first used in the 1890s. The Liverpool Overhead Railway opened in 1893 with two car electric multiple units, controllers in cabs at both ends directly controlling the traction current to motors on both cars. The multiple unit traction control system was developed by Frank Sprague and first applied and tested on the South Side Elevated Railroad (now part of the Chicago 'L') in 1897. In 1895, derived from his company's invention and production of direct current elevator control systems, Frank Sprague invented a multiple unit controller for electric train operation. This accelerated the construction of electric traction railways and trolley systems worldwide. Each car of the train has its own traction motors: by means of motor control relays in each car energized by train-line wires from the front car all of the traction motors in the train are controlled in unison. Types M8 married pairs in Port Chester, New York A First ScotRail Class 380 EMU at Haymarket in Edinburgh, Scotland The cars that form a complete EMU set can usually be separated by function into four types: power car, motor car, driving car, and trailer car. Each car can have more than one function, such as a motor-driving car or power-driving car. * A power car carries the necessary equipment to draw power from the electrified infrastructure, such as pickup shoes for third rail systems and pantographs for overhead systems, and transformers. * Motor cars carry the traction motors to move the train, and are often combined with the power car to avoid high-voltage inter-car connections. * Driving cars are similar to a cab car, containing a driver's cab for controlling the train. An EMU will usually have two driving cars at its outer ends. * Trailer cars are any cars that carry little or no traction or power related equipment, and are similar to passenger cars in a locomotive-hauled train. On third rail systems, the outer vehicles usually carry the pick up shoes with the motor vehicles receiving the current via intra-unit connections. Many modern 2-car EMU sets are set up as twin or \\"married pair\\" units. While both units in a married pair are typically driving motors, the ancillary equipment (air compressor and tanks, batteries and charging equipment, traction power and control equipment, etc.) are shared between the two cars in the set. Since neither car can operate without its \\"partner\\", such sets are permanently coupled and can only be split at maintenance facilities. Advantages of married pair units include weight and cost savings over single-unit cars (due to halving the ancillary equipment required per set) while allowing all cars to be powered, unlike a motor-trailer combination. Each car has only one control cab, located at the outer end of the pair, saving space and expense over a cab at both ends of each car. Disadvantages include a loss of operational flexibility, as trains must be multiples of two cars, and a failure on a single car could force removing both it and its partner from service. Examples Some of the more famous electric multiple units in the world are high-speed trains: the Italian Pendolino, Shinkansen in Japan, the China Railway High-speed in China and ICE 3 in Germany. The retired New York‚ÄìWashington Metroliner service, first operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad and later by Amtrak, also featured high- speed electric multiple-unit cars, see Budd Metroliner. Fuel cell development EMUs powered by fuel cells are under development. If successful, this would avoid the need for an overhead line or third rail. An example is Alstom‚Äôs hydrogen-powered Coradia iLint. The term hydrail has been coined for hydrogen-powered rail vehicles. Comparison with locomotives EMUs, when compared with electric locomotives, offer: *Higher acceleration, since there are more motors sharing the same load *Eddy current, rheostatic and regenerative braking on multiple axles at once, greatly reducing wear on brake pads and/or shoes and allowing for faster braking (lower/reduced braking distances) *Reduced axle loads, since the need for a heavy locomotive is eliminated; this in turn allows for simpler and cheaper structures that use less material (like bridges and viaducts) and lower structure maintenance costs *Reduced ground vibrations, due to the above *Lower adhesion coefficients for driving axles *A higher degree of redundancy - performance is only minimally affected following the failure of a single motor *Higher seating capacity, since there is no locomotive; all cars can contain seats. While electric locomotives, when compared to EMUs, offer: *Less electrical equipment per train resulting in lower train manufacturing and maintenance costs *Easily allows for lower noise and vibration in passenger cars, since there are no motors or gearboxes on the bogies below them Gallery File:NewGeneration710.jpgthumbA New Generation Rollingstock train in the Queensland Rail City network, Australia File:ICE 3 Oberhaider-Wald- Tunnel.jpgthumbA Deutsche Bahn ICE 3 EMU capable of up to in Rhineland- Palatinate, Germany File:Liverpool Overhead Railway carriage, Museum of Liverpool-2.jpgthumbLiverpool Overhead Railway EMU carriage in the Museum of Liverpool File:South Side Elevated Railroad car 1.jpgthumbSouth Side Elevated Railroad car #1, one of the cars that Frank Sprague converted to MU operation in Chicago File:ƒåD Class 641 in Adamov.JPGthumbA RegioPanter electric train File:Pendolino - ƒåD Class 680 (2).jpgthumbƒåD Class 680 File:Vande Bharat express for Katra IMG 20200131 054006.jpgthumbAn Indian Railways Vande Bharat Express train capable of up to 180 km/h (112 mph) at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra railway station, Jammu and Kashmir, India.

Such systems emerged from earlier traditions of symbol systems in the early Neolithic, as early as the 7th millennium BC. They used ideographic or early mnemonic symbols or both to represent a limited number of concepts, in contrast to true writing systems, which record the language of the writer. Neolithic =Neolithic China= Example of Jiahu symbols, found on tortoise shells dated around 6000 BCHelen R. Pilcher 'Earliest handwriting found? Chinese relics hint at Neolithic rituals', Nature (30 April 2003), doi:10.1038/news030428-7 \\"Symbols carved into tortoise shells more than 8,000 years ago ... unearthed at a mass-burial site at Jiahu in the Henan Province of western China\\".Li, X., Harbottle, G., Zhang, J. & Wang, C. 'The earliest writing? Sign use in the seventh millennium BC at Jiahu, Henan Province, China'. Antiquity, 77, 31‚Äì44, (2003). In 2003, tortoise shells were found in 24 Neolithic graves excavated at Jiahu, Henan province, northern China, with radiocarbon dates from the 7th millennium BC. According to some archaeologists, the symbols carved on the shells had similarities to the late 2nd millennium BC oracle bone script.. Others have dismissed this claim as insufficiently substantiated, claiming that simple geometric designs such as those found on the Jiahu shells cannot be linked to early writing. =Neolithic Europe= Clay amulet, one of the TƒÉrtƒÉria tablets, dated to c. 5300 BC The Vinƒça symbols (6th to 5th millennia BC, present-day Serbia) are an evolution of simple symbols beginning in the 7th millennium BC, gradually increasing in complexity throughout the 6th millennium and culminating in the TƒÉrtƒÉria tablets of c. 5300 BC.Haarmann, Harald: \\"Geschichte der Schrift\\", C.H. Beck, 2002, , p. 20 The hieroglyphic scripts of the Ancient Near East (Egyptian, Sumerian proto-Cuneiform and Cretan) seamlessly emerge from such symbol systems, so that it is difficult to say at what point precisely writing emerges from proto-writing. Adding to this difficulty is the fact that very little is known about the symbols' meanings. Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age The transition from proto-writing to the earliest fully developed writing systems took place in the late 4th to early 3rd millennia BC in the Fertile Crescent. The Kish tablet, dated to 3500 BC, reflects the stage of \\"proto-cuneiform\\", when what would become the cuneiform script of Sumer was still in the proto-writing stage. By the end of the 4th millennium BC, this symbol system had evolved into a method of keeping accounts, using a round- shaped stylus impressed into soft clay at different angles for recording numbers. This was gradually augmented with pictographic writing using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted. The transitional stage to a writing system proper takes place in the Jemdet Nasr period (31st to 30th centuries BC). A similar development took place in the genesis of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Various scholars believe that Egyptian hieroglyphs \\"came into existence a little after Sumerian script, and ... probably [were] ... invented under the influence of the latter ...\\",Geoffrey Sampson, Writing Systems: a Linguistic Introduction, Stanford University Press, 1990, p. 78. although it is pointed out and held that \\"the evidence for such direct influence remains flimsy\\" and that \\"a very credible argument can also be made for the independent development of writing in Egypt ...\\"Simson Najovits, Egypt, Trunk of the Tree: A Modern Survey of an Ancient Land, Algora Publishing, 2004, pp. 55‚Äì56. (See further .) Bronze Age During the Bronze Age, the cultures of the Ancient Near East are known to have had fully developed writing systems, while the marginal territories affected by the Bronze Age, such as Europe, India and China, remained in the stage of proto-writing. The Chinese script emerged from proto-writing in the Chinese Bronze Age, during about the 14th to 11th centuries BC (Oracle bone script), while symbol systems native to Europe and India are extinct and replaced by descendants of the Semitic abjad during the Iron Age. =Indian Bronze Age= Typical \\"Indus script\\" seal impression showing an \\"inscription\\" of five characters The so-called Indus script is a symbol system that emerged during the end of the 4th millennium BC in the Indus Valley Civilization. =European Bronze Age= With the exception of the Aegean and mainland Greece (Linear A, Linear B, Cretan hieroglyphs), the early writing systems of the Near East did not reach Bronze Age Europe. The earliest writing systems of Europe arise in the Iron Age, derived from the Phoenician alphabet. However, there are number of interpretations regarding symbols found on artefacts of the European Bronze Age which amount to interpreting them as an indigenous tradition of proto-writing. Of special interest in this context are the Central European Bronze Age cultures derived from the Beaker culture in the second half of the 2nd millennium BC. Interpretations of the markings of the bronze sickles associated with the Urnfield culture, especially the large number of so-called \\"knob-sickles\\" discovered in the Frankleben hoard, are discussed by Sommerfeld (1994).Christoph Sommerfeld, \\"Die Sichelmarken\\" in: Ger√§tegeld Sichel. Studien zur monet√§ren Struktur bronzezeitlicher Horte im n√∂rdlichen Mitteleuropa, Vorgeschichtliche Forschungen vol. 19, Berlin/New York, 1994, , pp. 207‚Äì264. Sommerfeld favours an interpretation of these symbols as numerals associated with a lunar calendar.Sommerfeld (1994:251) Later proto-writing Even after the Bronze Age, several cultures have gone through a period of using systems of proto-writing as an intermediate stage before the adoption of writing proper. The \\"Slavic runes\\" (7th/8th century) mentioned by a few medieval authors may have been such a system. The Quipu of the Incas (15th century), sometimes called \\"talking knots\\", may have been of a similar nature. Another example is the system of pictographs invented by Uyaquk before the development of the Yugtun syllabary (c. 1900). =African Iron Age= Nsibidi character for \\"welcome\\" Nsibidi is a system of symbols indigenous to what is now southeastern Nigeria. While there remains no commonly accepted exact date of origin, most researchers agree that use of the earliest symbols date back between the 5th and 15th centuries. There are thousands of Nsibidi symbols which were used on anything from calabashes to tattoos and to wall designs. Nsibidi is used for the Ekoid and Igboid languages, and the Aro people are known to write Nsibidi messages on the bodies of their messengers.

In the Quran, the word hukm is variously used to mean arbitration, judgement, authority, or God's will. In the early Islamic period, the Kharijites gave it political connotations by declaring that they accept only the hukm of God (). The word acquired new meanings in the course of Islamic history, being used to refer to worldly executive power or to a court decision. In the plural, ahkam, it commonly refers to specific Quranic rules, or to the legal rulings derived using the methodology of fiqh. Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as \\"the five decisions\\" (al-a·∏•kƒÅm al-khamsa): mandatory (far·∏ç or wƒÅjib), recommended (mand≈´b or musta·∏•abb), neutral/permissible (mubƒÅ·∏•), reprehensible (makr≈´h), and forbidden (·∏•arƒÅm). According to scholar of Islam Joseph Schacht, the categories were developed at least two centuries after Muhammad's time.  Five ruling types  Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as ‚Äúthe five rulings‚Äù (, ): # () - compulsory, obligatory # () - recommended # () - neutral, not involving God's judgment # () - disliked, reprehensible # () - forbidden It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action. Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court. Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while allowed actions entail no judgement from God. Jurists disagree on whether the term ·∏•alƒÅl covers the first three or the first four categories. The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (·∏çar≈´ra).  Examples of each ruling  Fard includes salat, Umrah, Islamic funeral, and responding to As-salamu alaykum. Mustahabb includes Sadaqah, shaving the pubic hair and armpit hair, and As- salamu alaykum. Mubah includes, in property law, possessions without an owner. Makruh includes divorce, profanity, consuming garlic before going to mosque, and using a lot of water for wudu. Haram includes zina, riba, shirk, and consuming blood and forbidden foods.  General considerations  The ·∏•ukm shar‚Äòƒ´ (a·∏•kƒÅm) in its literal sense carries the meaning of a rule of Islamic law. Thus a·∏•kƒÅm (rules) is the plural form of ·∏•ukm (rule), which means rule, command, the absolute, order, judgment, injunction, prescription, and decree. This rule could be a rule of any kind; it is to command one to delegate an order to another whether approval or disapproval. You could say that the moon is rising or the moon is not rising, or that fire burns. Technically, it is considered a rule of Islamic law. ƒÄmidƒ´ (d. 631/1234) defines adillah as the science of the proofs of fiqh and the indications that they provide with regard to the a·∏•kƒÅm of the sharƒ´‚Äòah. The ·∏•ukm shar‚Äòƒ´ consists of four fundamental elements. These elements are: the ·∏§ƒÅkim (Lawgiver), the ma·∏•k≈´m alayh (the subject), the ma·∏•k≈´m fƒ´h (the act of the mukallaf), and the ·∏•ukm (ruling). Emergency conditions Religious precepts may be relaxed under certain extraordinary conditions. For example, although Muslims are required to fast during Ramadan, it is not only acceptable but recommended for an ill man to break his fast if fasting will worsen his illness. Fatwa It is similar to but differs from a fatwa.

The regiment returned to the United States in September 1945 where it was inactivated. History The 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment was constituted on 26 December 1942 and assigned to the 13th Airborne Division. It moved from Fort Benning to Fort Bragg before being assigned to Camp Mackall, North Carolina, in January 1944, but was transferred to the Tennessee Maneuver Area and, in March 1944, assigned to the 17th Airborne Division, commanded by Major General William \\"Bud\\" Miley. The 513th PIR was not sent overseas until after the D-Day landings, which took place on June 6, 1944, and was still in training in England during Operation Market Garden in September. During the crisis of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, the division was flown into Reims, France and moved by truck into southern Belgium. In January 1945, the 513th Parachute Infantry was sent into the assault on Flamierge.

U.S. congressman James Meriwether was his son. Early years David Meriwether was born at \\"Clover Fields\\" (home of the Meriwether family), near Charlottesville in the Virginia Colony, on April 10, 1755. During his early years in Virginia, Meriwether developed a personal friendship with Thomas Jefferson who was a plantation neighbor of the family. Some time later, Jefferson hired one of Meriwether's cousins, Meriwether Lewis as his personal secretary, before eventually commissioning the young Captain to undertake the exploration of the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase along with William Clark. Military service David Meriwether joined the Continental Army in 1776 during the Revolutionary War. He fought in the Battle of Trenton (1776), Battle of Brandywine (1777), and the Battle of Monmouth (1778). Upon joining troops from his native state of Virginia, he was commissioned a lieutenant in New Jersey on May 15, 1779. Shortly thereafter, the Virginia troops marched south, to participate in the Siege of Savannah. During the march from Virginia to the outskirts of Savannah, Meriwether's column passed through Wilkes County. In his diary, he remarked that the countryside in that area of Georgia was particularly pleasing. In the subsequent Siege of Savannah, Meriwether was captured by the British and was paroled shortly thereafter. Following his parole, Meriwether returned to Wilkes County, where he married Frances Wingfield. They eventually had seven sons and one daughter. Meriwether continued to serve in the Army through the end of the war in 1783. In 1785, the couple settled in Wilkes County, where Meriwether had been granted land for his service in the Continental Army. During this period, his occupation was that of \\"planter\\". On September 21, 1797, Meriwether was commissioned a brigadier general in the Georgia militia by Governor Jared Irwin. In 1804, the family moved to Clarke County, near the city of Athens, where the General resided for the rest of his life. Political office Meriwether was the Wilkes County Tax Collector in the year 1794, before being elected to the Georgia House of Representatives where he served as speaker from 1797 until 1800. He was then elected as a Jeffersonian to the 7th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Benjamin Taliaferro and was reelected to the 8th and 9th Congresses. His time in federal office spanned from December 6, 1802, to March 3, 1807. He did not run for reelection in 1806 to the 10th Congress and retired to his plantation near Athens, Georgia. After his congressional service, Meriwether was appointed a commissioner to the Creek Indians in 1804 and repeatedly reappointed to treat with other tribes. Meriwether served as a Presidential Elector from Georgia in the election cycles of 1817 and 1821. Death and legacy David Meriwether died near Athens, Georgia on November 16, 1822 and was buried in the private burial ground on his plantation. He is the namesake of Meriwether County, Georgia.

The fossil remains were recovered in a series of expeditions during a period spanning the years 1999 and 2000 and were described by J.D. Harris and Peter Dodson in 2004. They consist of a disarticulated but associated partial skeleton, including partial vertebral series and limb bones. Etymology Skull Since the fossil was found in an ancestral territory of the Native American Crow tribe, the etymology of the generic name is derived from a term in their language, suuwassa, ‚Äúthe first thunder heard in spring‚Äù. The root suu, meaning ‚Äúthunder‚Äù and wassa, ‚Äúancient‚Äù, are a nod to the ‚Äúthunder lizard‚Äù moniker often applied to sauropods. The specific descriptor honours the deceased sponsor of the expeditions that recovered the fossil. Description Fifth and third to first cervical vertebrae Suuwassea is a dicraeosaurid, estimated to have been long, characterized by skull and axial skeleton features it shares with Diplodocidae and Dicraeosauridae though it is too primitive to pertain to any of the latter clades. The herbivore differs from dicraeosaurids in the unfused state of the frontal, and from diplodocids in the arrangement of bones around the foramen magnum, though it possesses a greater number of similarities with the latter than with clade Dicraeosauridae. Classification Skeletal reconstruction In the original description, Suuwassea was placed at Flagellicaudata incertae sedis due to the mosaic of primitive and derived characters found in both dicraeosaurids and diplodocids. Later phylogenetic analysis placed it as a member of the diplodocid subfamily Apatosaurinae, but subsequent studies recovered it as a North American member of Dicraeosauridae.

In 1996, the band entered a band competition for high school students called 'Hot Wave Music Awards' and won the first prize, beating nearly a hundred of other bands.

The fourth member was Thanachai \\"Yod\\" Tantrakul, the new guitarist who was brought in to replace Ratthapol. On 15 September 2007, Bodyslam released their fourth album Save My life and a major concert in Bangkok followed in early October of that same year. The success of the new album had brought them a bigger fan base. They became one of the most popular bands in Thailand. Save My Life won Season Awards for \\"Best Rock Group\\", \\"Best Rock Album\\" and \\"Best Rock Song\\" for \\"Yahpid\\" (‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏©: Poison) in March 2008. The single \\"Kraam\\" (‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏°: Indigo) was released in November 2009 in which the fifth studio album with the same name (Kraam) was released in the spring of 2010 (After late to June 2010 with 2010 Thai political protests). They performed the largest concert in Thailand called Bodyslam Live in Kraam, at Rajamangala National Stadium on November 27, 2010 with an audience of 65,000 people. They finished their tour on April 7, 2011 with the Bodyslam Live in Laos: World Tour at New Laos National Stadium. Their sixth album, \\"DharmajƒÅti\\" (meaning \\"nature\\" in Sanskrit), was released on September 25, 2014. DharmajƒÅti won \\"Best Album\\", the song \\"Chee-Wit Yung Kong Suay Ngarm\\" won \\"Best Recording\\" while the producer of the album, Poonsak Jaturaboon of Big Ass, won Producer of the Year in 26th Season Awards. In May 2015 Bodyslam had a concert \\"100 Plus presents Bodyslam 13 years Concert\\". It was an anniversary concert that had many songs from every album. The concert for 13 year of Bodyslam.This concert had an audience about 30,000 at Impact Arena Lakeside by Kala (group of producer).The concert had other singers, \\"Pu\\" Anchalee on the song \\"Ruk Yoo Kang Ter\\" (‡∏£‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏π‡πà‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ò‡∏≠ : Love Beside You) featuring Anchalee Jongkadeekij, Moderndog (music band), Labanoon on the song \\"Plid Plew\\" (‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏ß : Blown Away) featuring Methee Arun from Labanoon and the member from Bigass, Siriporn Aumpripong on the song \\"Kit Hord\\" (‡∏Ñ‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏Æ‡∏≠‡∏î : Miss you) featuring Siriporn Ampaipong and \\"Goft\\" Fucking Hero - \\"Aui\\" Buddabas on song \\"Sticker\\", They show a new song from the album \\"DharmajƒÅti\\" and famous songs from old albums, for example \\"Taang Kong Chun Fhun Kong Ter\\" (‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏â‡∏±‡∏ô ‡∏ù‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ò‡∏≠ : My path, your dream) from the album \\"Bodyslam\\", \\"Kwaam Sue-Sat\\" (‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏ã‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏™‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏¢‡πå : Honestly) from the album \\"Drive\\" , \\"Korb Fah\\" (‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏ü‡πâ‡∏≤ Edge of the sky) from the album \\"Believe\\" , \\"Yar Pid\\" (‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏© Poison) from the album \\"Save My Life\\" and \\"Kraam\\" (‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏° Indigo) from the album Kraam. The performance use time around 4 hours. In 2015 Bodyslam was given the award, Seed award of the year (Rock) from Seed Radio, And they show a concert with Carabao band (famous music band in Thailand). On 19 July 2015, Bodyslam released a new single \\"Wala Tao Nun\\" ( ‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏•‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ô Time Only) meaning \\"everything will have the answer by time\\".

The specific name was formerly usually written meade-waldoi. was a shorebird of uncertain taxonomy endemic to Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, and their offshore islets (Islote de Lobos and the Chinijo Archipelago) in the Canary Islands, Spain. It is now considered to be extinct. The Canary Islands oystercatcher has had a complicated taxonomic history. Though this bird was long known to naturalists, it was considered a mere local population or subspecies of the African oystercatcher (Haematopus moquini) until 1913; these two were at the time occasionally lumped as subspecies of the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus). Hockey (1982) concluded that the Canary Islands oystercatcher was actually a full species distinct from the African oystercatcher. However, DNA analyses conducted in 2018 and published in 2019 concluded that the Canary Islands oystercatcher was most likely a subspecies of the common Eurasian oystercatcher.  Taxonomy  The Canary Islands oystercatcher was long considered a population of the African oystercatcher until 1913, when David Armitage Bannerman identified it as the unique subspecies H. m. meadewaldoi. A study in 1982, however, found the Canary Islands oystercatcher to be distinct enough from the African oystercatcher to be upgraded to be its own species. In 2018, a genetic study of the Canary Islands oystercatcher's mitogenome found it to be genetically nearly identical to the Eurasian oystercatcher, with its genetic differentiation falling well within the range in variation observed in the Eurasian oystercatcher. It has thus been proposed that H. meadewaldoi be reclassified as either a melanistic color morph or subspecies of the Eurasian oystercatcher. Ornithological committees such as the International Ornithological Congress and BirdLife International need to decide whether or not to downgrade the species. Description The Canary Islands oystercatcher was of similar size as its relatives, the African and Eurasian oystercatchers, or about 40‚Äì45 cm (around 16.5 in); comparing with the non-migratory African species, it probably weighed between 600-800 grams in life, with females being slightly heavier. Its bill was some 70-80mm long in males and markedly longer (around 80mm) in females; the tarsus measured around 50 mm, and the wings were around 250-265mm long, with males possibly at the upper range of that size. Its appearance was extremely similar to the African species, to the extent that even hand-held specimens can hardly be told apart except by direct comparison or measurements. Its bill was longer and its wings were shorter than in the African species, which is not known to occur north of Lobito, Angola however, at least in modern times. But see Bolle (1857) who records the South African birds occurring as far north as Gabon. H. meadewaldoi had a glossy black coloration overall save for the whitish underwing bases of the primary remiges' inner webs, but this may have not been present in worn plumage which also was duller. Its bill, laterally compressed and with a blunt, lighter tip, and a narrow naked ring around the red eye were reddish orange, and the legs and feet were dark pink with ivory-colored nails. As usual in oystercatchers, it had no hallux and the second and third toes were connected by a small web. The sexes did not differ in color; juvenile birds are unknown but probably had duller bare parts and some greyish-buff fringes to the feathers. The coloration of downy young is likewise unknown; these are generally brownish- grey above with dark striping to provide camouflage against predators such as gulls; considering the dark lava rock habitat of this species, they were probably fairly dark overall and had a dusky belly. Habits The Canary Islands oystercatcher was apparently an all-year resident, and seems to have never bred or even strayed outside the eastern Canaries at least in historic times. Information about its ecology are scant and usually second-hand or inferred from circumstantial information. However, even though conjectural, these informations are consistent as the biology of oystercatchers is not very variable and the species was a conspicuous bird well known to locals. It was called cuervo marino (\\"sea raven\\") on Fuerteventura, grajo de mar (\\"sea chough\\" In mainland Spain, grajo denotes the rook, which does not occur on the Canaries.) on Lanzarote, and corvino (\\"little raven\\") on Graciosa. In addition, the local name lapero (\\"limpet-eater\\") was also used, possibly on Alegranza. The Canary Islands oystercatcher was in all likelihood a bird of the rocky shore rather than sandy beaches; although it might have been driven from the latter as they were much more utilized by humans ‚Äì which it tended to avoid. What is known about its feeding habits indicates that had always been less commonly found in beach habitat. As with all oystercatchers, its diet consisted of small molluscs and crustaceans rather than oysters. Especially the limpets Patella candei, Patella piperata, and Patella cf. ulyssiponensis, as well as the African mussel Perna (perna) picta were favorite prey items. Its vocalizations were given as repeated kvirr or kvik-kvikkvik, and the alarm call peepe-peepe peepe-peepe. The birds appear to have been territorial in the breeding season and vagrant, but not occurring in large groups, at other times. =Reproduction= Like other oystercatchers, this species did not build a nest but laid its eggs in a scrape on the seaside; apparently it chose the most deserted locations such as the mouths of barrancos (erosion gullies); eggs or nests were never recorded by researchers. Its courtship was reported to be peculiar, with two or three males joining in a \\"dancing\\" display, presenting themselves to best effect. Once the females had chosen a partner, they remained monogamous, probably for life if the pairing proved successful as in most other species of the genus. The clutch size was undocumented but possibly there was only one egg; groups of three, but not four birds were commonly seen. The eggs can be assumed to have been camouflaged as in its relatives; in the case of this species, they thus were probably rather dark overall, dull brownish grey with plenty of black, dark brown, and dark purplish splotches and scribbles. Egg size was probably about 60 x 40 mm on average. The breeding season is also unknown, but from observations of courtship and birds in laying condition, it started around April. Comparison with its relatives suggests that incubation lasted for around 30 days, maybe less, with the chicks taking around 35 days again to fledge. The three-bird groups started to occur on more populated regions in June. Females took probably 3 years to reach sexual maturity and males 4; this species can be assumed to have been long-lived like other oystercatchers, which not infrequently live for 20 or even more than 30 years. Unusually, the birds seem to have molted after the breeding season; 2 females shot in April had worn plumage. Extinction This bird was last collected in 1913, and local fishermen and lighthouse keepers reported it had disappeared around 1940, after a prolonged decline starting probably in the 19th century. It first seems to have disappeared from Lanzarote, in accord with the general pattern of Canarian extinctions. By 1913, it was not reported to have been found outside the Chinijo Archipelago and Islote de Lobos in recent times. It is now considered extinct, because extensive surveys between 1956/57 and the late 1980s failed to find any evidence of the Canarian oystercatcher's survival. It was officially declared extinct with publication of the 1994 IUCN Red List. There have been sight records of 3 black oystercatchers from the coast of Senegal, in 1970 and 1975 (Ziguinchor Region. but these are very unlikely to refer to this species which was by all accounts a resident bird never recorded outside the Canaries archipelago on other occasions. Two fairly convincing records from Tenerife - apparently in July 1965 or 1968 at Puerto de la Cruz, and in 1981 at El M√©dano, on the other hand, could indicate that a small population managed to persist on uninhabited islets until the early 1980s. Second-hand records from Tenerife also exists for the mid-19th century. The Senegal records are nonetheless puzzling, as none of the black species of oystercatcher are known to occur even in the general area; melanism is known to occur occasionally in the Eurasian oystercatcher which winters in the region; possibly the Senegal birds were such specimens. Over-harvesting of intertidal invertebrates and disturbance by people was probably the main underlying cause of its decline, although predation by rats and cats has also been implicated. In addition, its eggs were said to be of exquisite taste and consequently much collected. Although oystercatchers generally have adapted to the commonplace loss of the first egg in their clutch to predators and readily re-lay lost eggs, if the present species' clutch was indeed only one, egg collecting would have had a major impact: collectors would have to disturb more breeding pairs per number of eggs gathered. Also, adult birds were apparently opportunistically shot together with more plentiful migrant waders in the winter months and sold as salmuera (preserved in brine). It is unknown how far-reaching the direct impact of unsustainable agriculture practices, which led to widespread desertification especially of Lanzarote by the end of the 19th century, was. It might have altered local climate regimes, leading to increased pressure on intertidal habitat e.g. by increased flash floods causing silting of barranco mouths and delines in invertebrate populations there. There exist apparently only 4 specimens, three collected by Meade-Waldo in the BMNH and one collected by Bannerman in the World Museum Liverpool. The type specimen BMNH 1905.12.22.323 is a female shot at Jand√≠a, Fuerteventura, on April 7, 1888 or 1889. About the same time in the next year, a couple was taken on Graciosa. From there is also the last known specimen ‚Äì the male now in Liverpool ‚Äì shot on June 3, 1913. It is not known what became of the specimen shot in April 1852, apparently also near Jand√≠a, by Carl Bolle.

It is one of only three fortresses built by King John during his reign. The site was possibly chosen by King John because he had visited the area in 1204 and it lay halfway between Windsor and Winchester.  Construction  Odiham Castle was built on of land acquired from the local lord, Robert the Parker, by modifying a bend in the River Whitewater. The castle, which took seven years to complete, had a two-storey stone keep and a square moat. There were also raised banking and palisades. Notably, the stronghold also had a domus regis or king's house. Scrolls held by the Public Record Office indicate that total expenditure between 1207 and 1214, when work ceased, amounted to ¬£1,000 [equivalent to ¬£ in ].  History  thumb thumb A ground plan of the keep at Odiham Castle, published by the Royal Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland in 1872. In 1215 it was from either Odiham or Windsor that King John rode out to Runnymede, where he met the barons and attached his seal to the Magna Carta. A year later Odiham Castle was captured by the French after a two-week siege during the First Barons' War in 1216. The garrison of just 13 surrendered on 9 July 1216. At some point over the next nine years the keep was completely rebuilt, possibly to remedy the damage done to it by the French forces. At the same time the mound on which the keep sat was raised by 5 metres and an inner moat surrounding the keep was added to the defences. In 1238 Simon de Montfort married King John's daughter Eleanor just two years after she had been granted Odiham by her brother, King Henry III. In the following year a kitchen was added on a bridge over the inner moat and a new hall was added on the outside of the keep. During the same period a second building was constructed over the moat, this time on the south eastern side of the keep, to provide extra living space. In 1263 De Montfort rebelled against Henry and died at the Battle of Evesham in 1265; Eleanor was exiled. Odiham Castle was again retained by the Crown. The castle was also involved in the rebellion led by the powerful Despenser family against Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella of France, the wife of Edward II. Odiham Castle hosted Parliament at least once, in 1303. King David II of Scotland, after his capture at the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346, was imprisoned here for 11 years. He was held under a light guard and was allowed to keep a household. Using the castle as a prison seems to have been common practice during the 13th and 14th centuries; the nearby Manor of Greywell was required to provide guards one night in three. By the 15th century Odiham was used only as a hunting lodge, and in 1605 it was described as a ruin. In 1792 the Basingstoke Canal was built through the southern corner of the bailey.  Preservation Odiham Castle is open to the public. The only visible remains are part of the octagonal keep and outlying earthworks. In September 2007 Hampshire County Council undertook a restoration of the shell keep under guidance from English Heritage. The most southerly corner of the moat survives in the form of a small overgrown pond on the opposite side of the canal from the rest of the castle. Two series of archaeological excavations have been carried out at the castle, one in 1953 reported in a local newspaper, and the other between 1981‚Äì1985, carried out by Hampshire County Council Museum Services.

Light anti-aircraft armament and fire control was also improved. Royalist was further modified after completion with extra facilities and crew for directing carrier aircraft operations.  Development  The Royal Navy (RN) intended in late 1943 to use the Bellona class as flagships for escort carrier and cruiser groups for the projected invasion of Normandy and of southern France and for operations with the United States Navy and with the RN fleet in the Pacific. Royalist was a class of one from the start being fitted out - within months of commissioning - with further modifications. These modifications gave it two extra rooms for additional communications with aircraft carriers and Fleet Air Arm aircraft and one of the first implementations of an \\"Action Information Office\\" (AIO) ‚Äì an early operations room for plotting and display of the tactical position and associated mechanical computers to make it more effective. Intended to enhance the vessel's role as a command ship in northern Atlantic waters for operations against the German capital ships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, the extra equipment took the ship to the limit leaving minimal comfort and sleeping provision for crew. The wartime development of radar and the requirement to equip Royalist as a \\"Carrier Flagship\\"G. Mason, HMS Royalist navalhistory.net fitted with AIO increased the crew complement from 484 to 600, adding to the problem. Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Greenock built Royalist, with the keel being laid down on 21 March 1940. She was launched on 30 May 1942 and commissioned on 10 September 1943. She returned to the dockyard for alterations in November which were not complete until February 1944. Her motto, Surtout Loyal, translates to \\"Loyal above all\\". Royal Navy career A Supermarine Seafire of 807 Naval Air Squadron Fleet Air Arm flying above HMS Royalist during a training flight from the Royal Naval Air Station at Dekhelia, near Alexandria, Egypt in February 1945 Following her commissioning, Royalist spent several months working up, during which time she underwent repairs for trial defects and for alterations and additions. Amongst these were modifications for service as a carrier flagship. In March 1944 Royalist joined the Home Fleet and served for a short period in the Arctic theatre. In this capacity she took part in Operation Tungsten, the carrier raid against the German battleship Tirpitz whilst the Tirpitz was in Norway. Royalist was then ordered to the Mediterranean to support the Operation Dragoon landings in the south of France in August 1944, as part of the escort carrier squadron TF88.1 under the United States Navy's Task Force 88 After Dragoon, she joined the Aegean Force preventing enemy evacuation from the islands. On 15 September, accompanied by the destroyer , she sank the transports KT4 and KT26 off Cape Spatha. She was then stationed in the Aegean Sea until late 1944, when she was ordered to the East Indies. By April 1945 she was with the 21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron as flagship, supporting the Rangoon landings (Operation Dracula), and the following month was part of a force that failed to join the Battle of the Malacca Strait where five Royal Navy destroyers intercepted the Japanese cruiser Haguro and the destroyer Kamikaze evacuating troops from Port Blair in the Andaman Islands. For the remainder of the war she covered the carrier raids against targets in the East Indies and Sumatra. Scottish author Alistair MacLean served on Royalist during the Second World War, and used his experiences as background for his acclaimed first novel HMS Ulysses as well as for some of his subsequent works. Transfer to Royal New Zealand Navy Royalist was withdrawn from the East Indies after the conclusion of hostilities, and returned home to be mothballed and dehumidified in 1946. The reconstruction of Royalist from deep preservation with new superstructure and advanced interim fire control fitted involved major work but was intended to extend the cruiser's life for only 6 years. Diadem was better preserved and was offered to the RNZN as an alternative in 1955. In an 18-month refit, Diadem was updated and renamed Babur for Pakistan,A.

Lancer (1997) Delhi, pp. 56‚Äì62 As with the transfer of Royalist to the RNZN, the transfer of Diadem to Pakistan was controversial over the high cost of the refit.Goldrick,(1997),p52-62. Royalist and Diadem were complex warships even as built in 1944. After refit and rewiring in 1956 they could never really be turned off for more updating and had to be kept running with 200 men aboard even for short periods in reserve and refit; difficult for small navies such as the RNZN.

Hodder & Stoughton,(1981) London, pp314-20 The RAF had priority and the Royal Navy view that development should centre on frigates and large carriers was not liked by the old PM and the cruiser reconstruction programme was suspended for three years; also delayed by the immediate and changing priorities of the Korean War and the great difficulty and expense of developing compact steam propulsion with adequate range and speed and good close in defence for the destroyers and frigates. A radical defence review in June 1953 saw heavy naval cuts but Royalists modernisation continued under a revised defence White Paper in February 1954 which restored the RN programme and plans to complete Hermes and the Tigers, but rejected starting further Dido/ Bellona conversions; they lacked the 'dual war and peace, cold war capabilities' required for the RN.

British Cruisers World War Two and After, p 210 The NZ Prime Minister Sid Holland decided to accept to purchase a reconditioned Royalist for ¬£4 million in March 1955 after a seven week visit to the US and UK where he met Richard Nixon, John Foster Dulles and Churchill who stressed the new strategic reality of hydrogen bombs. Holland told the NZ Parliament than he was mainly influenced by the advice of the British Minister of Defence Harold Macmillan, New Zealand Parliamentary Debates 24 March 1955.

New Zealand Parliamentary Debates. 27 April 1955, p 575, 579 , the type was untested and unproven, and the RN did not view either the anti-submarine or anti-aircraft frigates being produced in 1955 as suitable for New Zealand and it was desirable to wait for new types of frigates suitable for NZ conditions with more gun power and anti- submarine capability: modified Whitby-class frigates or redesigned Type 41 frigates with 3/70 or 4/62 gun turrets effective against missiles and jets T. A. McDonald. NZ MOD. New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, 27 April 1955. Hansard, p575 & 579 The cost of Royalists reconstruction reached ¬£4.5 million.C. Pugsley. Confrontation. OUP p. 46 (the cost of two new 2500-ton frigates). A minority of RNZN opinion, including Cpt Phipps, saw it as a policy reversal stopping the RNZN maintaining a six frigate fleet, good training conditions and commonality with the RN. The Royalist, with massive RN/USN assistance, however returned over nine years of almost continuous service. After Suez in 1956 the Royal Navy transferred the bulk of the fleet to the Indian and Pacific oceans from 1957 to 1967 where, prior to 1955, there was only a token presence of a couple of cruisers and destroyers. As a result Royalist could be deployed effectively in 1957 with the RN carrier fleet. The ship was handed over to the Royal New Zealand Navy on 9 July 1956. When Captain Peter Phipps went to take command of Royalist in 1955, New Zealand diplomat Frank Corner showed his own view, when he noted that Phipps agreed that the ship was a white elephant, unsuitable for use in the Pacific. However The RNZN had operated the Bellona and Black Prince (the same class as Royalist) since 1946 as part of NZ Defence contribution in 1946‚Äì54.Pugsley (2003), p. 422, note 41 Phipps claimed the cruiser's range was limited and it could not even reach Panama without refuelling. However, Captain Phipps also stated when the cruiser reached Auckland, that it was updated, as a most modern warship, with the capability to take \\"three targets simultaneously, and shoot down air targets with reasonable frequency often on the first salvo\\"NZ Weekly News, 26 December 1956, \\"Royalist home for Christmas\\". Wilson & Hooton. Auckland (1956), p. 31 While the Type 12 frigates approved by Phipps had less endurance, it would have been more logical to order longer-range diesel versions of the Type 12, i.e. the Type 41 or Type 61. The Type 41/Type 61 original radar and fire control fit was similar to Royalist and the Type 12 HMNZS Otago G. M. Stephen. British Warship Design since 1906. Ian Allen. London (1985) p 76-84 D.

The New Zealand Navy Board, of which three members were RN officers, argued the RN view that the RNZN needed a cruiser in the South Pacific and to support the RAN/RN. The point of Royalist from the RN viewpoint was a powerful interim late 1950s medium range AA platform with 30rpm on two channels from 4 twin 5.25. The space and comfort problems were only minimally altered by any economy in the AIO suite or 40mm light AA and reducing to 3 main turrets destroyed the cruisers primary AA value. The cruiser was a RN cruiser on loan, and not renamed \\"HMNZS New Zealand\\". The UK did not regard the RNZN as an independent force compared to the RAN and RCN. Phipps demanded some improvementsRY257/182 9 April 1956 while in command of as an accommodation ship, and refused to accept the cruiser until three weeks later than intended by the RN Dockyard until alterations were made to the habitability of the cruiser. These notably included more showers, and some rectification of ventilation problems. Time was not available to install the pre-wetting, ABC spraydown equipment, specifically requested by the RNZN in 1955.Royalist Proceeding 1956‚Äì65. NZ National Archives. Wellington. NZ The Royalist needed to immediately work up for possible action in the Mediterranean. The dockyard noted that installing spraydown to wash nuclear fallout was possible, providing a wall-size copy of the plan of the pre-wetting system under installation in , and suggested the New Zealand dockyard could do the job. After modernisation, in 1957, Sheffield operated for only 15 months with the fleet, maintained as a static HQ ship capable of GFS, it had space, comfort, and elaborate staterooms. Royalist like the other Dido cruisers had a margin, allowing only the 47 officers, a standard cabin. Royalist offered speed and extra communications systems and an AIO (Action Information Office) fitted late 1943. The Dido cruiser, HMS Scylla, was also fitted with AIO as Admiral Vian, RN D-Day command ship, Scylla detonated a mine, 23 June 1944, uneconomic to return to wartime service Long term reconstruction at Chatham dockyard began and in 1945 it was approved for fitting with two twin Mk 6 Twin 3/ 70 mounts and 992 radar, N.

The concern of New Zealand naval servicemen and Phipps was on living conditions, recruitment,5.25 AA shell resupply in the Pacific and an affordable schedule of new frigates. The New Zealand Department of External Affairs viewed the British Treasury as getting rid of a unique cruiser and getting New Zealand to pay for the refit and other RN warships \\"Then Whitehall thought of New Zealand!\\"McGibbon, 1999, p. 186Templeton, 1994, p. 124 However, as with Bellona and Black Prince in 1946, transferring Royalist was arguably a backdoor supplement to Australian defence. By 1955 the RAN had only light 4.5-inch gun, Battle-class and Daring-class destroyers (building) and the light carriers, HMAS Melbourne and Sydney, with obsolete Sea Venom fighters just for Melbourne, the Royalist provided the only escort for Melbourne and Sydney and its surface 82 lb shells some deterrence to Sverdlov and Royalist, alone among RN cruisers had all turrets manned. Centreline 5.25 DP guns good in AA and GFS role with modern two-channel fire control and in the later 1950s the best British cruiser for radar processing and communications with the RN/ RAN Fleet air arm Australian PM Robert Menzies was dubious that RN policy in the age of nuclear deterrence was simply \\"minor fleet to the Far East in peacetime only\\" and no real counter to piecemeal communist erosion in SE Asia.

In some ways faster and more powerful in the air and surface role than HMAS Melbourne, a limited legacy hull, primarily usable as an anti submarine carrier. RANs Sea Venom fighters, 100 knots slower than Mig15/17 had AW/AD radar, but carried only 1 500lb bomb and rockets . Royalists close-in air defence of 40 mm STAAG 2 were initially sharper than other RN warships, and used standard RN 40 mm ammunition, but after a few years were a complicated, maintenance nightmare G.

London (1979) pp. 97‚Äì8.. Britain could not afford escorts larger than destroyers in addition to its carrier and frigate force but the 5.25-inch DP guns, fitted to Vanguard, and at Gibraltar to control the narrow straights as well as Royalist were accurate unlike the 4-inch AA on other 1950s RN cruisers. Royalist modernization for AA/AW and particularly AD support of RN carrier fighters and strike aircraft was useful for Musketeer and future operations of RN carriers East of Suez. Royalist could escort convoys across the whole distance at a speed of , compared with the Type 12's ability to make the long leg from Suva to Honolulu at 10/15. It was arguable that the traditional cruiser role in trade defence against Soviet cruisers and raiders was relevant, and contributing effective AW/AD for the RN/ RAN aircraft carriers was still the RNZN priorityPugsley, 2003, pp. 46, 422 (note 41) rather than impossible defence of Tasman and Pacific shipping against an undefined but modern Russian submarine threat. HMNZS Royalist at the Devonport Naval Base, 1956 After refitting, Royalist was re-equipped with new equipment as an AA and AD escort ship for carriers, retaining the 5.25-inch as more powerful high level AA and surface weapons rather than the usual 4-inch or 4.5-inch guns. However RN and British defence documents released under the 30-year rule showed the refit was to prepare it for all-out hot wars and high-level gun engagement of shadowers,E. Grove. RN since 1815.

The RAF estimated 300 Badger jet bombers in 1956 - the actual number was 500. The delay in the cruiser programme meant the cruisers were now more than ten years old doubling the cost of structural modernisation and reducing the programme to extended refits for Crown Colony- cruisers. Royalists update and a ten year life extension of HMS Ceylon was approved in.1953E. Grove.2006, p. 225 In transferring Royalist to New Zealand, the Royal Navy assumed the RNZN as an extension of the RN and the junior New Zealand service and government following British command. Around 25% of the officers on Royalist were RN officers on loan or exchange, as were many of the specialist ratings. The RNZN officers on the cruiser were usually of junior experience and had lengthy training with the RN in the UK. Even on the cruiser's final deployment in 1965 on Confrontation patrols in southeast Asia, many RN and RAN officers occupied higher-ranking officer positions on board.Pugsley, 2003, p. 38 Royal New Zealand Navy career After working up in UK waters, Royalist was operational with the British fleet in the Mediterranean. From August 1956, NZ PM Sid Holland was persuaded by Anthony Eden to maintain Royalist on station in the Med as an invaluable, 'strategic deployment' and 'deterrent' PRO:CAB 134//216.E(56) 12/8/56 & J Pearson. 'Antony Eden & the Suez Crisis. Reluctant Gamble'. Palgrave MacMillan (2005) NY, & Bassingstoke,p 49-56 against Egyptian or Israeli aggression. It was purely precautionary move Pearson(2005) pp49-56 & AP 20/25/7 PMPT T331/56/ no353 Eden to Holland 4 Aug 1956 , Eden assured Holland. At the same time Eden and the RN continued the dual strategy Pearson(2005) p49-56 while both negotiating with Egypt and preparing with war, and attempting to lock Royalist into the strategy, through the persuasion by the CNS Mountbatten of Lord of the Admiralty,Lord Hailsham. The fleet awaited the possibility of action against Egyptian air force during the Suez crisis. Royalist was intended to be mainly a radar picket and aircraft direction ship for the RAF English Electric Canberra bombers and RN carrier-based Hawker Sea Hawk and de Havilland Sea Venom aircraft. Royalist had the standard RN long-range air warning Type 960 radar carried by other British cruisers and carriers in the area, but Royalist was somewhat better equipped for aircraft direction than its other counterparts in the area. After hostilities with Egypt commenced, the resulting international outrage caused Prime Minister Sidney Holland to reverse his support for the British - calling for Captain Peter Phipps to withdraw from operations against Egypt. At that point the only other immediately available replacement cruiser was HMS Jamaica, a surface fighting unit without modern AA systems or the equipment to process air-warning radar data and \\"multiple communication channels\\" with Fleet Air Arm aircraft. Royalist continued for some time as the primary coastal AD ship - possibly for 24 hours - until HMS Ceylon transferred from shore bombardment duty off Port Said and the risk from Egypt's Gloster Meteors, MiGs and Badger bombers was suppressed. After about a day, HMNZS Royalist also withdrew from a scheduled bombardment mission in support of a RN destroyer squadron, moved further offshore away from the main body of the RN fleet (changing identity to the undefined, RNZN cruiser Black Swan according to some British published accounts) continuing to assist the RN fleet in its primary passive soft air warning and communications role.Kyle, 1991, pp. 394‚Äì395 Holland had officially ordered a withdrawal from operations but allowed the cruiser to stay with the Operation Musketeer fleet as \\"there was insufficient time for a decision not to withdraw\\" - an apparent non-decision. Much of the Soviet-supplied Tupolev Tu-16 and MiGs of the Egyptian Air Force remained a threat to the RN fleet, making the presence of Royalist crucial to fleet defence.Templeton, 1994, pp. 138‚Äì139; The reality of the pro-Musketeer sentiments of the RNZN/RN crew in which most of the key officer and senior rating positions were RN officers and many of the RNZN officers were also essentially professional RN career officers on the return voyage to New Zealand via South Africa. Captain Phipps told the crew they deserved the recognition given to RN personnel for their involvement in the incident.Pugsley, 2003 In the 2000s the New Zealand Labour Government and the RNZN awarded these personnel battle honours for war service in the Mediterranean. The cruiser's log for the crucial days of the Suez War was destroyed at the time meaning the full account of her Suez service will never be known. In early 1957 Royalist was involved in exercises with the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne. The cruiser made two shore bombardment missions in 1957‚Äì1958 during the Malayan Emergency against suspected terrorist areas in south east Johore, firing about 240 5.25-inch rounds.Pugsley. 2003, p. 50 In AA exercises with the British Far East Fleet in 1956‚Äì57, Royalist outperformed the (pre-war) RN Town-class cruisers, shooting down five jet Meteor unmanned targets and many towed targets immediately on opening fire.Pugsley, 2003, p. 49 In 1960 Royalist had a major five month refit. It was expected the cruiser would only serve another two and a half years; the New Zealand navy board was seeking loan of a third Whitby-class frigate (Type 12) from the Royal NavyD. Fairfax.

OUP.(2000) Auckland, p186-7 & 467 However the RN was only just introducing and trialling the improved Rothesay class (Type 12M) frigates and was short of effective frigates and cruisers. In February 1964 after HMAS Voyager was lost after it collided with the aircraft carrier Melbourne, the UK offered Australia the Daring-class destroyers, HMS Duchess (available immediately) and HMS Defender then in mid life refit with new MRS3 fire control.

In 1962 the still joint-crewed RNZN/RAN/RN Royalist suffered serious damage proceeding at high speed in rough sea conditions through the Tasman to get to a six test series between the Wallabies and All Blacks at Eden Park. The cruiser operated with the British Far East Fleet, in three tours of duty in 1963, 1964 & 1965, during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation the crews being belatedly awarded General Service Medals for the 1963‚Äì64 tours and Operational Service Medals for active service in combat zones in 1956, 1957‚Äì1958 and 1965, finally recognised by the New Zealand government in 2000. From mid-1963, reports by the captain of Royalist noted that one of the two Mk 6/275 HALADCTs were often unserviceable, as often one or two STAAGs were, while the ship's hull and lower structure was marginal requiring constant work and frequent painting, requiring an extra Asian workforce due to the construction of the cruiser out of \\"low quality wartime steel\\", and the ship's below-deck humidity and constant temperature at a minimum of . The ship's modernisation had provided only for a lifespan of six years, so these conditions were expected. Effective modernisation of the ship after acquisition from the Royal Navy only amounted to several ECM/ESM updates. By May 1964 the Indonesian Confrontation had escalated with Indonesian forces conducting cross-border raids in Kalimantan and landings in Borneo.

There was considerable doubt among RNZN staff whether Royalist, which had not had a major refit since 1956, could deploy again in 1965. It managed to deploy again after a seven-week refit working round the clock in Devonport dockyard and work up in the Hauraki Gulf, where it managed at half power. The cruiser was still visually impressive, and provided the appearance of capability and ability to operate. It was judged that the fire control systems needed either a year's refit or $140,000 of new parts,Reports and Returns.

The high-maintenance Tiger- class cruisers required far too much human and technical resources to be operate East of Suez in a complimentary role, for GFS and carrier escort role with the Far East Fleet; HMS Lion was withdrawn after a boiler explosion on anti-infiltration patrol, and was put into reserve from December 1963 due to crew shortages in the RN. HMS Royalist was still perceived by the RN as useful and needed in Singapore, even if it could not run at the 25+ knots a carrier group needed to launch aircraft as an escort for amphibious carriers like HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark and it was decided Royalist would proceed to Pearl Harbor for a second workup, rather than a longer refit in the Devonport dockyard, before deploying to Hong Kong and Singapore in support of RN forces. During Royalist stay at Pearl Harbor the USN Staff and naval dockyard provided substantial assistance in alleviating some of the cruiser's faults and adjustments to allow the fire control system to be aligned for brief periods. During the subsequent workup Royalist achieved \\"E Excellent\\" for Efficiency, meaning maximum efficiency within system capability though, like all peacetime naval or weapon tests, actual effectiveness was not measured.

Early and private life His grandparents, John James Sainsbury and Mary Ann Staples, established a grocer's at 173 Drury Lane in 1869 which became the British supermarket chain Sainsbury's. He and his wife Doreen with whom he married in 1925 had three sons: * John, later The Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover * Simon * Timothy, later Sir Timothy Sainsbury He later remarried in 1944 and had a daughter Paulette. As he was divorced, he spent little time with his sons John Davan, Simon and Timothy, and so they only got to know their father when they joined the family firm. On 3 May 1962 he was the first of three members of the Sainsbury family to receive a life peerage. He took the title Baron Sainsbury, of Drury Lane in the Borough of Holborn. As the first peerage using the family name, the territorial designation ‚Äì referencing the location of the family's first shop ‚Äì did not form part of the title. When Alan's son John became a peer in 1989, he took the title Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover to differentiate between them. In the same way when Alan's nephew David was ennobled in 1997 he was made Baron Sainsbury of Turville. Business career Educated at Haileybury College, Alan joined Sainsbury's in 1921 aged 17, the same year his youngest uncle, Paul Sainsbury, joined the family firm. He began his career working alongside his uncles as a buyer. He became a director of the Company, then known as J. Sainsbury Ltd., in 1933 and became joint managing director of Sainsbury's with his brother Robert Sainsbury in 1938 after his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury (the eldest son of Sainsbury's founder John James Sainsbury), had a minor heart attack. Alan Sainsbury was instrumental in bringing the self-service supermarket to Britain and shaping many of the conditions by which we shop for food today. On a trip to America he saw the experience of self-service supermarkets, and John James Sainsbury's show-piece Croydon branch of Sainsbury's was converted to self-service in 1950. On handing out wire baskets on opening day, one customer was so annoyed, she threw a basket in Alan Sainsbury's face, and one member of staff refused to be an assistant in a self-service supermarket. In 1956, he became chairman after the death of his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury. The original shop at 173 Drury Lane closed in 1958. The Manager Mr Pawsey handed Alan Sainsbury the key, saying, 'Your grandfather opened this shop, and I think it's only right that you should close it'. Alan Sainsbury also pioneered fresh and frozen foods, and increased Sainsbury's own label range. He introduced oven-ready frozen chickens and the simple but powerful slogan \\"Good Food Costs Less at Sainsbury's\\" in 1959. Sainsbury's also released its first public relations video in 1964. He retired as chairman in 1967 to be replaced by his brother Robert, and became Life President. On Sir Robert's retirement in 1969, at which point his son John Davan Sainsbury became chairman, Sir Robert was appointed Joint Life President of the retailer. By this time Sainsbury's boasted 244 UK grocery stores (162 self-service shops and 82 counter service stores). The average size of new supermarkets was . The range of products increased from 350 to 4,000 (including 1,500 own brand products). In 1969 sales reached ¬£166m and profit before tax was ¬£4.3m. The Company also boasted the highest sales per square foot in the food retailing industry and the market share of the UK supermarket business was 2.5%, turning Sainsbury's into a medium-sized, regional business in London and the South-East. When the company listed on to the London Stock Exchange on 12 July 1973, as J Sainsbury plc, which was at the time the largest flotation ever, his family at the time retained control with an 85% stake. Alan Sainsbury split his 18% stake in the business between his sons John Davan Sainsbury, Simon Sainsbury and Tim Sainsbury, and so they held 6% each. Meanwhile, his brother Sir Robert Sainsbury gave his entire 18% stake to his only son David Sainsbury. It is believed that Sir Robert Sainsbury gave David Sainsbury his entire shareholding (rather than split it between David and his three daughters) so that David would have more votes at the table, considering John Davan Sainsbury, who became chairman in 1969 on Sir Robert Sainsbury's retirement, had a forceful, autocratic style of leadership, whereas David was always more cautious (and always seemed less interested in the family business than John Davan (David having only joined Sainsbury's personnel department as he did not get the grades to become a scientist)). Alan and Robert's sons John and David both chaired the family firm and were later awarded life peerages. Political career Alan Sainsbury also stood as a Liberal parliamentary candidate at Sudbury in the 1929, 1931 and 1935 general elections, before joining the Labour Party in 1945. In 1981, he was one of 100 prominent supporters of the \\"Gang of Four\\" who broke away from Labour to form the SDP.

Formation of his company He started his apprenticeship for Havercroft Wheelwright in Barnetby (North Lincolnshire). He came to Grantham in 1810 looking for work. He approached Richard Seaman, the village blacksmith of Barrowby. When working in Barrowby, he had the idea to put a set of wheels on an adjustable harrow. Seeing this inventiveness, Seaman offered him a partnership in his company. Seaman & Hornsby was started with business partner and blacksmith, Richard Seaman, a fellow methodist. The firm became Richard Hornsby & Sons in 1828, when Seaman retired. The company made ploughs and seed drills. By 1840, the company made steam engines, which were used for traction engines in the 1850s. These were used for harvesting crops. His family Five of his children were Richard (born 1827), Louisa, James (born 1836), Helen Mary Anne and William (born 1838). He died on 6 January 1864. His wife, Mary, died on 15 October 1866, aged 66. At the time of his death he had eight grand children. Two of his great-grand children would go to Eton. Although there is no monument to Richard Hornsby, one of his great-grandsons, Richard William Hornsby, is listed on the war memorial in Barrowby, after being killed in the First World War in Greece. His family were quite wealthy owning of land, as the Hornsby company was a world leader in engine manufacture, until 1918.

Extensive remains of buildings and fortifications built during the rule of the Chutias near about Sadiya still point to the importance of the region in the past. Historically Sadiya included the entire districts of Lakhimpur, Dhemaji and Tinsukia. It was the center of development of the Eastern form of Prakrit during both the Chutia and Ahom periods, which later gave rise to the modern form of Assamese.Yasmin Saikia, Assam and India: Fragmented Memories, p.6Its stands on a grassy plain, almost surrounded by forested Himalayan mountains, on the right bank of Lohit River which is locally (but erroneously) considered the main stream of the Brahmaputra river. Sadiya is famous for a flower named satphul (the word means \\"blessing\\" or a \\"desert flower\\"), which is much like Jasmine.  Etymology  The word \\"Sadiya\\" is derived from the Deori-Chutia language and it stands for \\"land of rising sun\\". \\"Sa/Xa\\" means \\"Sun\\", \\"Di\\" meaning \\"water\\" and \\"Ya\\" meaning \\"land\\". There is a sloka from the 14th century which shows that the region had a very ancient origin. It reads, According to another source, the Gauda ruler possibly Keshav Sen made friends with the Chutia king Ratnadhwajpal (Gaurinarayan) who sent one of his sons to that country for education. Unfortunately, the Chutia Prince died there and the corpse was sent to Gaurinarayan. At the time of the arrival of the corpse, Gaurinarayan was engaged in building a new city. He named the city Sadiya (sa \\"corpse\\", diya \\"given\\"). The ancient city of Sadhayapur/Sadiya can be identified as Bhismaknagar today, situated in the north of modern-day Sadiya town.  History  =Early history= According to mythology, Sadiya was the capital of the legendary king Bhirmuko which was sanskritised to Bhismak (whom the Chutiyas considers themselves as descendants of), but archeological evidence shows that this place became a capital only during 7th-8th century.Bhismaknagar is dated to the 8th century. There are ruins of an old city known locally as Bhismaknagar which was probably built by the earlier Chutia kings. Sadiya was later rebuilt by Gaurinarayan, the second ruler of the medieval greater Chutia dynasty during the mid 13th century and remained as the capital till the 16th century. = British period = Sadia College. Sadiya was the extreme north-east frontier station of British Raj, in the Lakhimpur district of Eastern Bengal and Assam regions. On the opposite bank is a railway station which used to connect with the Assam-Bengal line of that era. Sadiya had been garrisoned by detachments of native infantry and military police, and was the base of a chain of outposts. There had a bazaar, to which the hill-men beyond the frontier‚ÄîMishmis, Abors, and Khamtis‚Äîused to bring down rubber, wax, ivory, and musk, to barter for Cotton cloth, salt and metal goods. In 1943-44 there was a United States Army Air Force (USAAF) field at Sadiya which hosted the 89th Fighter Squadron of the 80th Group, headquartered at Nagaghuli, now Chabua Air Base of the Indian Air Force. Sadiya today serves as one of the district headquarters for Indian Red Cross. In 1882 Francis Jack Needham was appointed Assistant Political Agent for the British authorities after having served in the region as an assistant Superintendent of Police since 1876. He finally retired from service in 1905 after spending his life exploring above the Brahmaputra river and writing a treatise on the grammar of Miri, Singpho, and Khamti languages. He was awarded the Gill memorial medal in 1887 and made a fellow of The Royal Geographical Society in 1889. His main purpose in life was exploration partly in order to try and discover the source of the Brahmaputra river. His award of the Gill memorial Medal and F.R.G.S. was for penetrating into the Zanjul Valley and into Tibet from Assam. Another name for Sadiya was Sindhu khetra.  Architecture and ruins  The entire area of Sadiya was a well developed city in the medieval times. The ruins like Bhismaknagar, Rukmininagar, Tamreswari temple, Shiva temple, Pratima garh, Bura-buri temple were build during the Chutia period. =Tamreswari(Kechai- Khati) Temple= Sketch of an Elephant statue in Tamreswari Temple. This was the most notable among the temples built by Chutia kings. The name \\"Tamreswari\\" was given as the roof of the temple was made out of copper. As per the Kalika Purana, the main temple was octagonal in shape surrounded by eight dwarapals in eight directions. When the Britishers visited the temple complex, the main temples has disappeared and only a small square structure remained. The wall and doors of the temple were well designed with beautiful works. There were two giant elephant sculptures with silver tusks at the main door of the complex. The walls were made without any mortar and instead used iron dowels and brackets. The whole temple was surrounded with brick walls and on the western wall there was a place for human sacrifice.. Although the temple is now completely submerged under marshy lands due to silt deposition in 1959, previous studies show that the main statues of the temple were built of sandstone and granite. Ruined gateway of Tamreswari temple The stone iscription found in the temple reads,Sircar,D.C,Journal of Ancient Indian History, p. 21. The inscription describes that the walls of the temple have been built by the son Mukta Dharmanarayan of the old king(name not specified) in the Saka year 1364(1442 AD). The temple is said to be dedicated to the goddess Digarabaxini(Kechai-khati). Sketch of a statue in Tamreswari Temple The roof of the Tamresari temple was originally sheeted with copper as mentioned in the Changrung Phukan Buranji(1711 AD), from which the name is derived. In 1848, when Dalton visited the site, he found a stone structure, but the copper roof was already removed. As per T.Block who visited the site in 1905, this square structure in the corner cannot have been the main building inside the complex and the brick wall evidently enclosed some sort of a grand temple in the center which has disappeared with time. According to S.F. Hannay, the temple complex was as near as possible square with the doorway to the west. There was a substantial brick wall, about 4.5 feet thick rising to the height of 8 feet, on the foundation of rudely cut blocks of sandstone. The entrance of the complex was on the west face, where there had been a stone enclosure and door. The ruins of the gateway which remains include the lintel carved on the edge in a chain of lotus flowers, some ornamented small pillars and an elephant statue. The three blocks forming the doorway, each of 7.5 feet long and 2 feet by 18 inches in girth, along with the blocks of the projecting wall, were reddish porphyritic granite of an adamantine hardness. There was another stone gateway at the southeast corner leading to the stream, in the bed of which are several carved and plain blocks of granite and sandstone.Hanney, S.F. Journal of the Asiatic Soceity of Bengal p. 468. According to Debala Mitra(1956), the temple was originally Chaturayatana, i.e. having four shrines, built of sandstone and granite and located in the south-east section of the rectangular brick enclosure, prakara roughly measuring 208 ft by 130 ft. The compound wall was 4 feet wide and 8 feet tall and had a stone gateway on the eastern side. In the floods of 1959, due to deposit of silt in the banks of Paya river the structure was completely submerged in the waters. Religious history of Arunachal Pradesh by Byomkesh Tripathi =Bura-Buri(Gira-Girasi) Than= Bura Buri Temple The Bura-Buri Than (temple) is another important temple built by the Chutia kings. It was dedicated to Shiva-parvati locally known as Gira-Girasi in the Chutia language. Although the structure has fallen due to natural calamities, the base still remains intact upon which a new temple has been built. The foundation is an octagonal shaped base made of stone with each edge spanning 3.4 meters in length. The temple was built using granite stone and fixed using iron dowels and brackets similar to the ones used in Malini Than and Tamreswari temple. The temple was surrounded by a wall built using bricks of 18-25 cm length and 12-17 cm breadth.Baruah, Swarnalata. Chutia Jaatir Buranji. 2007, p. 433. Granite stones used in Bura-buri Temple showing the holes for the iron brackets. =Bhismaknagar Fort= Ruins of a brick wall in Bhismaknagar The Bhismaknagar Fort located in Roing is an important monument built by Chutia kings with the walls of the fort spread over 10 sq. km. A brick with the name Lakshminarayan indicates that the fort was repaired during the 15th century. The Bhismaknagar central complex extended over an area of 1860 square meters and displays three halls, six ingresses and two extension rooms. There is also a 2 meters high stone wall inside the complex. The architecture of the fort displays medieval culture. While quarrying in the fort, enormous pieces of work of art like potteries, terracotta figurines, terracotta plaques and decorative tiles were recovered. Fabricated from the burnt bricks gave this fort an impressive and remarkable top view and thus explores the dexterity of people of ancient era. This fort can still be signified as an astonishing work of art. The city is spread over an area of 10 square km. It is surrounded by a wall 4.5 meters high and 6 meters wide made using granite stone(6-9 courses)Gait, Edward. A history of Assam(2nd Edition). 1962, p. 16. and bricks on the east, west and south directions. In the north, the Mishmi hills provided a natural barrier. Although very less excavation has been carried out by the Arunachal government, preliminary excavations have revealed three tanks and two gates in the eastern and western directions.Raikar, Yashawant. Archeology in Arunachal Pradesh. 1980, p. 19. The Bhismaknagar central complex extended over an area of 1860 square meters and displays three halls, six ingresses and two extension rooms. There is also a 2 meters high stone wall inside the complex. The architecture of the fort displays the medieval culture. While quarrying the fort the enormous pieces of work of art like potteries, terracotta figurines, terracotta plaques and decorative tiles were preserved. =Rukmini Nagar= In the hills north of Roing lie scattered some old brick structures, mainly betweeh the Chidu and Chimri villages situated at an altitude of about 305 m. The local people, the Idus, were desirous of giving an Idu word to the name, and hence it came to be called Rukmini Nati (nati‚Äîthe Idu word for bricks). An exploration-cum- excavation work, undertaken by the Research Department of the Government of Arunachal Pradesh, to study the ruins, has thrown some light on the antiquities. In course of the progress of work, which continued from January 1973 to April 1974, excavation of two mounds at Chimri, II km from Roing, unearthed two rooms, 10x10 m and 10x12 m respectively built on a slope, at a distance of 14 m from each other. The contents dug out from inside the walls of the rooms were of river-borne materials, a fact which suggests that they were destroyed by floods. The potsherds resembling those of Bhismaknagar in shape, fabric and technique that were unearthed bear ample evidence to the extension to this area of the same culture as of Bhismaknagar. The other archaeological sites in this area are located (I) near Chidu Inspection Bungalow, (2) at Cheko Nati between Chidu and Chimri and (3) in the hills north of Chimri. No relics, however, could be found at the first two sites, although potsherds at Chidu and brick walls, steps, etc. at Cheko Nati were reported to have been seen earlier. The third site north of Chimri is situated at a high altitude of about 610 m. Not a single brick found there was in alignment, and everything seemed destroyed. The situation of all the four sites on a hilly terrain suitable for defence indicate that they are parts of a single complex representing a fort which extended from Chidu to Chimri. It is probable that the main centre of this complex was at Cheko Nati. Another archaeological site called Duku Limbo is on the left bank of the Dibang at'the foot of Elopa hill. The brickbats found at this site suggest that the Brismaknagar culture had extended upto this point. Lohit District =Tezu Fort= An old Mud Fort in the Tindolong area, six km from Tezu, was explored in 1972. It falls on the main road from Sadiya to Tezu. The area of the fort, enclosed by earthen ramparts‚Äî365.76 m X 350.52 m, is square in shape. The rampart is eight ft high, and equally broad at the top with sloping sides. On both the -inner and outer sides of the rampart run two ditches about 6 m wide. There is a prominent mound, circular in shape (diameter 30.48 m approximately) and about 3 m in height, almost at the centre of the enclosure. The mound appears to be a cavalier for lookout purposes. Some potsherds found at this site are too fragmentary to bear any conclusive evidence. It may, however, be assumed that the Mud Fort linked by the route from Bhismaknagar to Parshuram Kund was probably associated with the early culture that flourished in and around Sadiya and Bhismaknagar. Lohit District The complex seems to represent a defensive mud-fort or redoubt of a modest dimension unlike the fortified city of Bhismakanagara. It was suitable for a small band of soldiers to maintain vigilance against the enemies from their hide-outs inside jungle especially in guerilla warfare, the normal practice in the region. Scarp and counter-scarp provided by the rampart and ditches immensely strengthened the defence in the toppgraphy of the country. Strategic considerations are palpable from the situation of the fort on principal route from Sadiya and Bhismaknagar to Parshuram Kund facing the Lohit river, perhaps to keep watch on the enemy from its left bank around Chowkham and hence the position of the mound meant for this purpose nearer the river. The fort has been assigned roughly to a period about the 14th-15th century.[https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/jspui/bitstream/10603/159414/8/08_chapter%203.pdf Chattopadhyay, S., History and archaeology of Arunachal Pradesh, p. 71  Geography  Sadiya is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Sadiya It has an average elevation of .

Overview Akhlaq is most commonly translated in English dictionaries as: disposition, nature, temper, ethics, morals or manners (of a person).J. Cowan p. 299 It is the plural of the word khulq which means disposition. \\"Disposition\\" is a faculty (malakah)J. Cowen p.1082 - malaka (pl. -at) trait of character, faculty, talent of the soul (nafs) which unconsciously inspires activities. Malakah comes into existence through repetitive practice and is not easily destroyed. A particular malakah may appear because of one of the following reasons: #Fitrah (natural state): The original state in which humans are created by Allah. Muslims believe Allah determined certain aspects of their lives for which they are not accountable (e.g., their place of birth and physical appearance)J. Esposito p. 89 #'ƒÅda (Habit): Formed by continual repetition of certain acts and creates a certain disposition. #Practice and conscious effort: Which if persistent will eventually produce a disposition. Although fitra produces certain dispositions, man can surpass nature through free will and effort. While dispositions caused by mental faculties (i.e., intelligence, memory, mental agility etc.) are not alterable, all others can change. When we speak of man's capacity to change his dispositions, we do not mean he should destroy instincts of reproduction or self-preservation. Instead, he should avoid extremes so they perform their functions properly. Abu Hurairah narrated that Prophet Muhammad has said: \\"Indeed I have been sent to complete the best of character (akhlaq).\\"Sahih Muslim, 6017 Anas, the brother of Abu Dharr is narrated as saying: \\"I saw him (the Prophet), he would enjoin the people to good character and conduct.\\" The Prophet also said, \\"The most complete of believers in iman (faith) are those who are best in character.\\"Sahih al- Tirmidhi, 2003 ='Ilm al-Akhlaq= The level of human perfection is determined by discipline and effort. Man stands between two extremes, the lowest is below beasts and the highest surpasses even the angels. The movement between these extremes is discussed in \`ilm al-akhlaq or the science of ethics. Traditional Muslim philosophers believed that without ethics and purification (tazkiyah), mastery over other sciences is not only devoid of value, but would obstruct insight. That is why it has been said that, \`knowledge is the thickest of veils', which prevents man from seeing reality (haqiqah). By improving their akhlaq, the Muslims improve their Ibadah. Tazkiyah al-Nafs Moral virtues bring eternal happiness, while moral corruption leads to everlasting wretchedness. Man must purge blameworthy traits (akhlƒÅq madhm≈´ma) before he can integrate ethical and moral virtues. Anas Karzoon has offered the following definition of tazkiyah al-nafs, \\"It is the purification of the soul from inclination towards evils and sins, and the development of its fitrah towards goodness, which leads to its uprightness and its reaching ihsaan.\\"Karzoon (Vol.1 p.12) Attempts to obey God's commands are successful only when one is purified; then the soul can receive God's unlimited grace. The hadith of the Islamic prophet Muhammad: (\\"My religion is based on cleanliness\\"), does not refer to outward cleanliness alone; it also alludes to the soul's inner purity. To attain perfection, it is necessary to struggle against lusts and immoral tendencies, and prepare the soul to receive God's grace. If man travels the path of purification, God will aid and guide him. As the Quran says: And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good..Qur'ƒÅn, Chapter 29, Verse 69 Malakah of the Soul: Effects & Characteristics The soul is created devoid of traits. As one progresses through life, he develops malakat related to his lifestyle. The soul becomes accustomed to repeated behavior, which then determines actions. Noble faculties manifest moral and wise behaviour, while evil faculties manifest immorality. These faculties determine the fate in the Akhira. The Quran says: And We have fastened every man's deeds to his neck, and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall bring out for him a book which he will find wide open.Quran Surah Al-Israa ( Verse 13 ) ÀπAnd it will be said,À∫ ‚ÄúRead your record. You ÀπaloneÀ∫ are sufficient this Day to take account of yourself.‚Äù.Qur'ƒÅn, Chapter 17, Verses 13-14 **And the book shall be set in place; and thou wilt see the sinners fearful at what is in it, and saying, \`Alas for us how is it with this Book, that it leaves nothing behind, small or great, but it has numbered it?' And they shall find all they wrought present, and thy Lord shall not wrong anyone.Qur'ƒÅn, Chapter 18, Verse 49 **The day every soul shall find what it has done of good brought forward, and what it has done of evil; it will wish if there were only a far space between it and its deeds.Qur'ƒÅn, Chapter 3, Verse 30 The Soul and Its Powers The soul (nafs) employs the body to attain its goals. The soul has also other names, including spirit (ruh), intelligence ('Aql), and heart (qalb) although these terms have other usages. The primary faculties of the soul are: #Intelligence (al-quwwah al-aqliyyah)- angelic. #Anger (al-quwwah al-ghadabiyyah)- ferocious. #Desire (al-quwwah al-shahwiyyah)- animalistic. #Imagination (al- quwwah al-wahmiyyah)- demoniac. The value of these forces is obvious. Reason distinguishes good and evil: ghadab (anger)J. Cowen p.791 helps defend against aggression: sexual attraction maintains the survival of the human species; and imagination allows visualization of universals or particulars. Reason is man's guiding angel. Anger brings violence; passions (hawƒÅ) encourage immorality; and imagination provides material to formulate demoniac plots and machinations. If reason controls the other faculties, it moderates excesses and ensures useful performance. Allah says in surat Ash-Shams: And [by] the soul and He who proportioned it, And inspired it [with discernment of] its wickedness and its righteousness, He has succeeded who purifies it, And he has failed who instills it [with corruption]..Ash-Shams: Verses 7-10 The soul is in a continuous jihad (struggle) between these four powers for domination. The victorious trait determines the soul's inclination. In a hadith from Imam Ali, he is related as saying: Surely God has characterized the angels by intellect without sexual desire and anger, and the animals with anger and desire without reason. He exalted man by bestowing upon him all of these qualities. Accordingly, if man's reason dominates his desire and ferocity, he rises to a station above that of the angels; because this station is attained by man in spite of the existence of hurdles which do not vex the angels.Nahjul Balagha Pleasures and Pains The soul experiences pleasure when perceiving something harmonious with its nature. Pain occurs when it contacts things in disharmony. The soul's pleasures and pains are also divided into four categories, each corresponding to one of the four faculties. #Pleasure of the reasoning faculty lies in gaining knowledge and its pain lies in ignorance. #Pleasure of the faculty of anger lies in feelings of overcoming an enemy and revenge. Its pain lies in the feeling of being overpowered and defeated. #Delight of the faculty of desire is enjoyment of foods and drinks while its pain lies in denial of such experiences. #Pleasure of the imaginative faculty lies in the visualization of particulars which lead to the appearance of carnal desires, while its pain lies in the insufficiency and inadequacy of these visions. The strongest of pleasures is experienced by reason. This pleasure is inherent and constant. It is unlike the other pleasures, which are transitory and often embarrassing. Rational pleasures have many degrees, the highest of which is nearness to God. This sublime pleasure is attained through love and knowledge of God, acquired through effort to be closer to Him. When efforts are directed to this goal, sensual pleasures are overshadowed; taking their proper place in moderation. Goodness and Happiness The aim of tazkiyah and moral development is to attain felicity and happiness. Man's most consummate felicity is reflecting Divine attributes. According to Qatada ibn al-Nu'man, the content soul (an-nafs al-mutma'inna) is, \\"the soul of the believer, made calm by what Allah has promised. Its owner is at complete rest and content with his knowledge of Allah's Names and Attributes...\\"The Purification of the Soul p.71  See also  * Islamic ethics Notes References *J.M.

Slim jims are used to unlock automobile doors without use of a key or lock pick. It acts directly on the levers and interconnecting rods that operate the door, completely avoiding the complexity of dealing with the lock mechanism itself. The hooked end of the tool is slipped between a car's window and the rubber seal, catching the rods that connect to the lock mechanism. With careful manipulation, the door can be opened. Unskilled use of the tool will often detach the lock rods, leaving the lock inoperable even with the key. This is often a clue that someone has attempted to break into a car. Newer cars have also incorporated internal defenses against this tool such as barrier blocks on the bottom of the window, preventing entry, and also shrouding the operating rods and the lock cylinder to prevent manipulation of internal linkages. There have been unsubstantiated claims that in modern vehicles there is a chance for setting off the side airbag deployment system of the vehicle, possibly causing injury to a person using a slim jim. However, according to research by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, this has not been verified and manufacturers state it is impossible.

In the aftermath of a successful coup against president Vicente Guerrero, he was placed at the head of a triumverate that led the Mexican government during the last days of 1829. Biography V√©lez was born into a well-to-do family. He studied in Zacatecas and Mexico City, becoming a lawyer. He occupied the post of justice minister and minister of religious affairs. He also became head of the Supreme Court (in succession to Miguel Dom√≠nguez) during the presidency of Vicente Guerrero. Guerrero temporarily left the presidency to Jos√© Mar√≠a Bocanegra in 1829 to combat a rebellion in Jalapa, Veracruz, but Bocanegra was overthrown within a week . The Council of Government named a Supreme Executive Authority to occupy the presidency temporarily. As president of the Supreme Court, V√©lez was named to lead this triumvirate, which also included General Luis de Quintanar and historian Lucas Alam√°n, leaders of the rebellion against Bocanegra. Quintanar was a strong supporter of Anastasio Bustamante, leader of the Plan de Jalapa against Guerrero and Guerrero's former vice-president. V√©lez was president between 23 and 31 December 1829, after which Bustamante assumed the presidency. Thereafter V√©lez retired to private life and the exercise of the legal profession. He again presided in the Supreme Court of Justice in 1844 and in January to April 1846. He died in Mexico City on 5 August 1848. There is a city called Pedro V√©lez in the Mexican state of Durango.

History  Having originally come to notice with the band Tattooed Love Boys, CJ had subsequently been a founder member of The Wildhearts (playing second guitar and singing harmony vocals). Multi-instrumentalist Willie Dowling had previously been part of The Grip, and later joined The Wildhearts as keyboard player for tours and studio sessions (contributing to their debut album Earth Vs. The Wildhearts). Although asked to stay on as a permanent member, Dowling chose instead to leave the band and pursue his own projects. In summer 1994, during the recording of the second Wildhearts album, CJ was sacked from the band following clashes with Wildhearts frontman Ginger. He subsequently teamed up with Dowling for a new band which became Honeycrack. With Dowling opting to front the band on lead vocals and guitar (and CJ playing a similar role to the one he'd performed with the Wildhearts), the Honeycrack lineup was completed by the addition of third guitarist Mark McCrae (previously with hotly tipped London rock band Rub Ultra), session drummer Hugo Degenhardt and bass player Pete Clarke. All members sang, providing a dense harmony vocal sound to complement the band's driving rock songs (predominantly written by Dowling and following the same pattern of rough-edged pop sensibility as those of The Wildhearts). On the strength of their demo and the existing reputation of the members, Honeycrack signed to the Epic Records label and released their sole album, Prozaic, in 1996 (the artwork of which depicted one band member's naked parent). The album contained the singles \\"Go Away\\", \\"Sitting at Home\\", and \\"King of Misery\\". Both \\"Sitting at Home\\" (when re-issued) and \\"King of Misery\\", entered the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. The album enjoyed similar success in the UK Albums Chart. After a hiatus, Honeycrack parted company with Epic, releasing the single \\"Anyway\\" on EG records. This track would later be re-recorded by Dowling and became the theme tune for the Channel 4 show Armstrong and Miller. Although public response to the band had been fairly good, and although material was demoed for a second album (later to be known as PS The Unreleased Demos), Honeycrack split up in the late 1990s. Willie Dowling went on to form the SugarPlumFairies (whose debut album Fruit Karma contained re-worked and re-recorded versions of songs planned for the second Honeycrack album) and the pop-rock group Jackdaw4 as well as writing songs for TV shows. C.J. formed the pop-punk outfit The Jellys (with ex-Wolfsbane bass player Jeff Hately and ex-Wildhearts drummer Stidi) and would re-join the Wildhearts in 2001. Mark McCrae, Pete Clarke and Hugo Degenhardt formed an even more short-lived band called The Bugs. Degenhardt would eventually join The Bootleg Beatles. In 2014 Willie Dowling teamed up with Jon Poole to form The Dowling Poole. CJ released a solo album on 4 August 2014 entitled Mable, and a second solo album entitled Robot in early 2016. Both albums were self- released and funded via the Pledgemusic crowdfunding website.

Location Donaghmede is situated approximately to the north east of the Dublin city centre, and is in the constituency of Dublin Bay North. It lies within the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council and the postal district Dublin 13. Donaghmede lies west of Baldoyle from which it was largely formed, north of Raheny, east of Coolock and Balgriffin and south of Portmarnock. In the northern part of Donaghmede is the Grange Stream, running in culvert from western Donaghmede, past Grange Abbey and flowing into the Mayne River in northern Baldoyle. Flowing through the southern parts of Donaghmede is another stream, the Kilbarrack Stream and/or Daunagh Water, culverted in stage in the 1970s and 1980s. It reaches the sea at two points in lower Kilbarrack / Bayside, though in earlier times it joined with the Grange Stream and ultimately flowed into the Mayne River, feedback Baldoyle Bay. =Access= Road Donaghmede is served by Grange Road [R809](to Baldoyle and Howth) and R139 from the Malahide Road and M50 and M1, to the north, and the Tonlegee Road [R104] to the south. Rail In the south eastern corner of Donaghmede is Howth Junction & Donaghmede railway station, situated on the Dublin‚ÄìBelfast railway line and served by Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) and occasional InterCity (Iarnr√≥d √âireann) trains, while in the northern part is Clongriffin railway station. Bus Dublin Bus provides services on routes 29A (from the city centre), 17A from Kilbarrack Industrial Estate to Blanchardstown Shopping Centre via (Coolock, Santry, Ballymun and Finglas), 15 from Clongriffin to Ballycullen Road (via Malahide Road, City Centre, Rathmines and Terenure), and the 29N Nitelink service with late night service from D'Olier Street to Baldoyle Road, stopping on Grange Road. History and naming Donaghmede was formed by Dublin City Council, which owned most of the lands, from around 1970, built-up from housing developments it had commenced on the inland areas of Baldoyle; the earlier history is that of the parent district. Some lands of Coolock and some addressed as Raheny were also involved. Further estates were added over the following decades. The name of the newly-designated area was taken from the \\"big house\\" located in its assigned centre, Donaghmede House. =Historical features= The once popular Saint Donagh's Well, a holy well, was regularly visited for hundreds of years. It is said that the waters of Saint Donagh's Well healed eyes and rejuvenated eyesight. Saint Donagh's Well was once one of three local holy wells which were visited in procession. In the northern part of Donaghmede is Grange Abbey, historically \\"a small church within the Grange of Baldoyle\\" which served as a chapel for the lands of the Priory of All Saints (now site of Trinity College Dublin). The chapel, which once hosted a small parliamentary meeting, has been in ruins since at least 1615. Facilities and amenities =Parks= The redeveloped Father Collins Park was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of Dublin in May 2009 and is Ireland's first \\"sustainable park\\" with five 50KW wind turbines protruding from the central linear water feature and providing power for public lighting, maintenance depots and football club changing rooms. The park also features a skate-park, 2 playgrounds, 6 playing pitches, picnic areas with outdoor chess/draughts boards, natural woodlands and a peripheral running/cycling track. Further information on the park including pictures, opening times etc. can be found on the Dublin City Council website. Other green spaces lie around the main complex of schools, around the church and along the Kilbarrack Stream and above its culverted course. =Education= There are four primary (two junior, Scoil Bhride and St Kevin's, two senior, Holy Trinity and Naomh Colmcille) and three secondary schools (Grange Community College, Donahies Community School and Gaelchol√°iste Reachrann) in the area, and a \\"vertical\\" school ‚Äì catering for children from Junior Infants to Sixth Class ‚Äì St Francis of Assisi Primary School ‚Äì in the Belmayne estate in nearby Balgriffin. =Civic facilities= There is a Dublin Public Libraries branch library in the main shopping centre. =Sport= There are a number of soccer and Gaelic football clubs in the area along with the local Sports and Leisure Centre (http://trinitysportsandleisure.ie/). These include Wyteleaf United, Trinity Gaels GAA club, and Trinity Donaghmede FC (previously called \\"Donaghmede Celtic and Trinity Sports and Leisure Football Club\\")as well as new club Carndonagh Athletic Football Club and Grange Abbey Boys FC. The area is also well served by the famous Trinity Boys Boxing Club. =Retail= Donaghmede Shopping Centre stands on the site of the original Donaghmede House. Dunnes Stores is the anchor tenant along with 50 other shops along with a cafe and a branch of Dublin City Libraries. Currently, the centre is being improved and redeveloped. However a number of local residents groups, such as the Donaghmede Estate Residents Committee, and some public representatives, have opposed the developments. The Donaghmede Inn pub and some other shops have direct access from outside. Near the shopping centre is a medical centre with a pharmacy and cafe, and there is a small shopping precinct in Clare Hall, between Donaghmede, Ayrfield and Coolock. Religion Holy Trinity Parish Church, a distinctive cruciform building with a triangular profile, is Roman Catholic. Located on Grange Road, Holy Trinity Church serves the combined ecclesiastical parish of \\"Donaghmede-Clongriffin-Balgriffin\\" in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin.Dublin diocese - guidebook A large mosque and Islamic cultural centre was planned for the Clongriffin housing development, and received planning permission, confirmed on appealIreland's largest mosque gets planning permission but was abandoned.The town that almost was: What became of an ambitious urban development near Dublin? Politics and community representation Since 2016, Donaghmede has been part of the D√°il √âireann constituency of Dublin Bay North. Donaghmede is part of the Beaumont/Donaghmede electoral ward for Dublin City Council, which also includes neighbouring Coolock, Artane, Edenmore, and Kilbarrack. The Beaumount/Donaghmede electoral ward has nine elected local councillors with Sinn F√©in being the largest party, taking more than 35% of the first preference vote and three seats in the 2014 local elections. Fianna F√°il, People Before Profit, Fine Gael, the Anti-Austerity Alliance and Labour Party secured one seat each, along with an independent councillor.http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2014L&cons;=5026 Residential Unlike many other suburbs of Dublin, Donaghmede was not a village absorbed by suburban sprawl; rather it was an area of farmland, with a number of large houses with attendant workers' cottages (many of these latter survive along the Hole in the Wall Road that leads to Portmarnock, but none of the original \\"big houses\\" exist today). Within Donaghmede are a number of housing developments, notably Donaghmede Estate, Grangemore, The Donahies, Grange Abbey, St Donagh's, Millbrook, Newgrove Estate and Howth View. The bulk of these developments were constructed between circa 1970‚Äì1974. Newer developments included apartments at Priory Hall, and opposite those a number of developments forming Clongriffin. =Priory Hall= The apartment development at Priory Hall in northern Donaghmede was evacuated by order of the High Court made 14 October 2011, to allow for emergency fire safety works. The 294 residents were originally due back by 28 November 2011, but as of May 2020, only some have been able to return. The landowner and Tom McFeely, the owner of the construction company, are both bankrupt, with the latter first attempting to file for bankruptcy in the UK. This bankruptcy was overturned when it emerged that his main dwelling and business interests were in Ireland. Declared bankrupt in Ireland in 2012, his ‚Ç¨15m home in Ailesbury Road, Dublin 4, was re-possessed. In September 2013, ‚Ç¨140,000 in ‚Ç¨50 notes was found under the bath of his former Ailesbury Road house. The find is being probed by the Criminal Assets Bureau. While most of the former residents were originally placed in a hotel, many were later rehoused in National Asset Management Agency property a couple of hundred metres to the east in Clongriffin, or to the west in the Belmayne development, south Balgriffin.

Hans Rosbaud was born in Graz, (Austria). As children, Hans and his brother Paul Rosbaud performed with their mother, who taught piano. Hans continued studying music at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, under the tutelage of Bernhard Sekles in composition and Alfred Hoehn in piano. Rosbaud's first professional post was in Mainz, starting in 1921, as the music director of the city's new School of Music, which included conducting the municipal symphony concerts. He became the first chief conductor of the Hessicher Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra (later the Hr-Sinfonieorchester) of Frankfurt in 1928.Potts, Joseph E., \\"European Radio Orchestras: Western Germany\\" (September 1955). The Musical Times, 96 (1351): 473-475. During the 1920s and 1930s, he presented premieres of works by Arnold Schoenberg and B√©la Bart√≥k. During the Nazi era, his freedom to present new music was restricted. In 1937, he became the general music director of the city of M√ºnster. In 1941, Rosbaud took the same position in Strasbourg, heading the Orchestre philharmonique. In 1945 he was named music director of the Munich Philharmonic by United States occupation authorities. In 1948, Rosbaud's contract with the Munich orchestra was allowed to lapse because the city authorities wanted to move the orchestra's repertoire in a conservative direction. That year Rosbaud became the first chief conductor of the South West German Radio Orchestra in Baden- Baden, where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1954, he conducted the first performance of Schoenberg's opera Moses und Aron at 8 days' notice; this performance was issued on a 1957 commercial recording for Philips.Obituary for Hans Rosbaud (1963). The Musical Times, 104 (1440): 126. He regularly took the SWR Symphony Orchestra to festivals of contemporary music, such as at Donaueschingen.Helm, Everett, \\"Donaueschingen Festival\\" (December 1956). The Musical Times, 97 1366: 657-658. On 6‚Äì8 December 1962, he concluded a six-week residency with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, leading Schumann's Piano Concerto with Eugene Istomin and Mahler's Ninth Symphony. He died less than a month later in Lugano, Switzerland on 29 December. Gramophone recently remarked that Rosbaud \\"was one of the unsung heroes of mid-20th-century music, who ... gave thoroughly rehearsed and assimilated performances and premieres of the widest possible range of music\\".Gramophone, Sep 2007, p43 In Fanfare, Peter J. Rabinowitz pointed to range of his sympathies, claiming it was \\"greater than that of just about any of his contemporaries except perhaps Bernstein, Scherchen, and Stokowski. Rosbaud is best remembered, probably, for his Mahler, his Bruckner, his work with the Second Vienna School ... and especially his commitment to the post-war avant-garde. But he was a world- class Mozartian, too (his Aix-en-Provence Mozart operas from the 1950s hold up far better today than the better-known Busch recordings from Glyndebourne)‚Äîand he championed earlier music as well (he recorded Gluck‚Äôs Orfeo ed Euridice and Rameau‚Äôs Plat√©e). What‚Äôs more striking is that he was able to give his performances of each of these composers an entirely different signature.\\" Fanfare, May/June 2005 Rosbaud was a highly cultured man, widely read and varied in his intellectual interests. Putting himself at the service of music he chose to perform, he commanded the respect of numerous notable composers of the 20th century. Prominent in his legacy are recordings of the music of Bruckner, Mahler, Stravinsky and Boulez. A tireless advocate of new music, he was closely associated with Karl Amadeus Hartmann, conducting premiere performances of Hartmann's opera Simplicius Simplicissimus and his Second and Fourth Symphonies, amongst others. Rosbaud mastered five different musical instruments, from various sections of the orchestra. His favorite pastimes consisted of reading world literature in the original languages (ancient and modern), and studying scientific journals.

The station broadcasts a news talk format focused on issues and news pertaining to members and staff of the United States government. Owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, WFED transmits with a power of 50,000 watts continuously. As of July 1, 2017, WFED is also available on WTOP-FM-HD2 in the Washington, D.C. area. History =Formation of Federal News Network= The format was launched by Bonneville International, former owners of terrestrial-based all-news station WTOP, as FederalNewsRadio.com‚Äîthe first Internet-only all news station, and the first Internet station to make the jump to terrestrial radio‚Äîon February 22, 2000. For some time before then, WTOP had significant listenership among federal employees, and many of them had emailed the station asking for more coverage tailored to federal employees. The programming concept has changed little to this day, except that the Associated Press' All News Radio service originally filled in during the overnight hours, as a complement to WTOP. It is one of a few radio stations that originated on the Internet prior to moving onto a traditional broadcasting signal. It first found a home on the radio dial in 2004, on the 1050 kHz frequency licensed to Silver Spring, Maryland; that station was founded in 1946 as beautiful music station WGAY, but had become business radio station WPLC by 2004, when Bonneville bought the station and converted it to Federal News Radio and the WFED call letters. When AP All News Radio was terminated, the station began an affiliation with CNN Headline News, which itself was phased out in 2007 by provider Westwood One. In November 2007, the 1050 frequency increased its daytime power from 1 kW to 3.5 kW in order to better reach the government office workers in Washington, D.C. who comprise its core audience. The 1050 frequency is now used by Hubbard as regional Mexican station WBQH. =Washington Post Radio= The current WFED, along with WWFD, WWWT-FM and W282BA, were former frequencies and simulcasts of WTOP. On March 30, 2006, WTOP transitioned entirely to FM, with 1500 AM (previously the main frequency) and 107.7 becoming \\"Washington Post Radio\\" under the calls WTWP and WTWP-FM, respectively. The primary AM station was one of the oldest frequencies in the capital. It had originally been founded as Brooklyn, New York station WTRC in 1926, moving to Washington in 1927 as WJSV. A series of power increases culminated in its current 50,000-watt facility in Wheaton in 1940. The call letters became WTOP in 1943. WWWT-FM had operated as a simulcast of WTOP since 1998. WWFD had simulcast WTOP since 2000 (and carried the WTOP calls on the AM band following the sign-on of WTWP) before switching to a simulcast of WTWP as WTWT on June 28, 2007. As WTWP, these stations provided news and commentary during the weekday hours in a long-form style similar to that of National Public Radio, but on a commercial station staffed and programmed jointly by the Washington Post and WTOP. From 8 PM to 5 AM ET, the station was programmed as a general interest talk radio station, featuring hosts such as Clark Howard, Larry King and Jim Bohannon. On weekends, WTWP rebroadcast programs produced by Radio Netherlands and George Washington University. =WWWT: \\"Talk Radio 3WT\\"= The Washington Post reported that they would discontinue the Washington Post Radio service after Bonneville decided to pull the plug, citing financial losses and low ratings. Bonneville International officially launched personality driven talk format Talk Radio 3WT, with the WWWT call letters on September 20, 2007 (with 820 using the call letters WWWB). The call letters stood for \\"Whatever We Want\\" talk radio from the station's imaging. The morning show with David Burd and Jessica Doyle was retained along with all live sporting events, The Tony Kornheiser Show and automotive commentator Pat Goss. Syndicated talkers Neal Boortz, Bill O'Reilly, Randi Rhodes and Phil Hendrie were initially added to the lineup, as was a simulcast of sister station KSL's Nightside with Michael Castner overnight program. Stephanie Miller was added in November after the Washington Nationals' season ended, and Glenn Beck was added, replacing Randi Rhodes on the 1500 and 107.7 frequencies, in January 2008. \\"Federal News Radio\\" logo from 2011 through 2018 Sports that had been broadcast on 3WT continued on 1500 kHz and 820 kHz. The stations remained the flagships of Washington Nationals baseball until 2011, when the team changed its primary station to WJFK- FM.Federal News Radio Expands to Full Market Signal (3wtradio.com) Bonneville announced the sale of WFED and WWFD, as well as 15 other stations, to Hubbard Broadcasting on January 19, 2011; this put WFED under common ownership with KSTP, Hubbard's flagship station and the other clear-channel station on 1500 kHz.WTOP news radio to be sold to Minnesota broadcaster The sale was completed on April 29, 2011. In October 2018, WFED rebranded from Federal News Radio to Federal News Network, as part of an effort to rebrand the station as a multi- platform outlet. =Cully Stimson controversy= On January 11, 2007, while being interviewed on WFED's morning program The Federal Drive, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs Charles \\"Cully\\" Stimson criticized some major U.S. law firms for representing detainees at Guantanamo Bay pro bono. Stimson further suggested that U.S. corporations who retained these same U.S. law firms should reconsider their associations with those firms. His comments drew immediate criticism from legal scholars, professional legal associations and the ACLU, and even the Pentagon itself sought to distance itself and the Bush administration from Stimson's comments. Although he apologized a few days later, on February 2, 2007 Stimson resigned his position with the Pentagon, saying he believed the flap would prevent him from effectively doing his job. The controversy heightened the profile of the station, however, as the station's morning hosts and reporters were interviewed by news organizations around the world about the controversy.\\"Pentagon Official Who Criticized Detainee Lawyers Quits\\", The Washington Post (February 7, 2007), p. A06.\\"'Cully' Stimson Stepping Down\\", Federal News Radio (February 2, 2007).] Programming WFED is the flagship station for George Washington Colonials basketball. It also carries selected Navy Midshipmen football, basketball and lacrosse games as an affiliate station. WFED is the flagship station of the Washington Wizards. The station was dropped as the flagship of the Washington Nationals Radio Network in favor of WJFK-FM in 2011. WJFK-FM also replaced WFED as the flagship of the Washington Capitals radio network beginning in the 2012-13 season. WFED temporarily returned as the Capitals' flagship in the 2016-17 season when the team and WJFK-FM owner CBS Radio could not extend their agreement.

The other two members were Jean Beetz, law professor at the University of Montreal and a noted authority on the Canadian Constitution and John Parker, the Mayor of Yellowknife at the time and a mining engineer. The commission was established in April 1963 by the government of Lester B. Pearson. The three-man membership was appointed in 1965. It conducted surveys of opinion in the NWT in 1965 and 1966 and reported in 1966. Major recommendations included that the seat of government of the territories should be located in the territories (the Northwest Territories Legislative Council was based in the national capital, Ottawa, at the time). Yellowknife was selected as the territorial capital as a result. Transfer of many responsibilities from the federal government to that of the territories was recommended and carried out. This included responsibility for education, small business, public works, social assistance and local government. The commission also reported that while division of the NWT was not advisable at that time, it was in the long term probably desirable and inevitable.

Born in Louisa County, Virginia, Meriwether moved with his parents to Jefferson County, Kentucky, in 1803. He attended the common schools and engaged in fur trading in 1818 near what is now Council Bluffs, Iowa. He later engaged in agricultural pursuits in Jefferson County. Meriwether studied law, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice. He was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1832 to 1845. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1847 to the Thirtieth Congress. He was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1849, and was Secretary of State of Kentucky in 1851. Meriwether was appointed as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Henry Clay, and served from July 6, 1852 to August 31, 1852, when Archibald Dixon was elected his successor. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1852. He was appointed by President Franklin Pierce as Governor of the Territory of New Mexico, after the position was turned down by Solon Borland, from 1853 to 1855. He later served again in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1858 to 1885, and served as speaker in 1859. After this he retired to his plantation near Louisville, Kentucky. He was interred in Cave Hill Cemetery. References * *Meriwether, David. My Life in the Mountains and on the Plains. Edited by Robert A. Griffen. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1965.

See 3.468, 4.434, and 4.564 in Peirce's Collected Papers. The syntax is: * The blank page; * Single letters, phrases; * Objects (subgraphs) enclosed by a simple closed curve called a cut. A cut can be empty. The semantics are: * The blank page denotes False; * Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs can be True or False; * To surround objects with a cut is equivalent to Boolean complementation. Hence an empty cut denotes Truth; * All objects within a given cut are tacitly joined by disjunction. A \\"proof\\" manipulates a graph, using a short list of rules, until the graph is reduced to an empty cut or the blank page. A graph that can be so reduced is what is now called a tautology (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the satisfiable formulas of first-order logic. Peirce soon abandoned the entitative graphs for the existential graphs, whose sentential (alpha) part is dual to the entitative graphs. He developed the existential graphs until they became another formalism for what are now termed first-order logic and normal modal logic. The primary algebra of G. Spencer- Brown's Laws of Form is isomorphic to the entitative graphs. See also * Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography * Logical graph References * Peirce, C.
