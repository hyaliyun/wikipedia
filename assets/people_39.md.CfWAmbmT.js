It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Kirner Land, whose seat is in the town of Kirn. Geography =Location= Brauweiler lies in the southern Hunsr√ºck at an elevation of 323 m above sea level in the western Soonwald foothills above the Kellenbach and the municipality of Simmertal. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Brauweiler's neighbours are the municipality of Kellenbach, the municipality of Simmertal, the municipality of Horbach, the municipality of Simmertal (again), the municipality of Hochstetten-Dhaun and the municipality of Heinzenberg. Brauweiler's municipal area comes within several metres of Hennweiler‚Äôs, but does not actually border on it, while Simmertal‚Äôs crescent- shaped municipal area means that it borders on Brauweiler‚Äôs in two places, one each side of Horbach. History Many prehistoric archaeological finds from various epochs bear witness to very early settlers within what are now Brauweiler‚Äôs municipal limits. The oldest finds come from the New Stone Age (3500-1800 BC). The village originally belonged to the greater municipal area of Simmern under Dhaun, a lordly estate held by Saint Maximin‚Äôs Abbey, an Imperial monastery, and in which the Waldgraves of Dhaun exercised Vogtei rights. In the Late Middle Ages, Brauweiler was subject to the Sponheim lordship of Koppenstein. The village‚Äôs boundary alignment within the Amt of Koppenstein often led to disagreements with the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves, who had their seat at Dhaun, because territorial and judicial rights were not altogether clearly defined. The Rhinegraves‚Äô position, for instance, was that the Brauweiler municipality outside its estate fences had neither its own municipal area nor any rights, but rather that it should be used together, for its water and grazing, with the inhabitants of Simmern. The Waldgrave and Rhinegrave of Dhaun also claimed fishing, hunting and forestry rights there. All this was argued at the Palatine arbitration tribunal, and it ruled that these rights belonged to the Counts of Sponheim. Brauweiler remained until the end of feudal times a part of the Amt of Koppenstein, which was subject to the Badish Oberamt of Kirchberg. Ecclesiastically, Brauweiler was always subject to the parish of Simmern and Dhaun. After the German lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank were occupied by French Revolutionary troops and administrative reform on the French Revolutionary model had been begun in 1798, Brauweiler was assigned to the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Monzingen. In the time that followed, Monzingen remained Brauweiler's Amt seat. Since the Amt was dissolved in 1970, however, Brauweiler has been part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn- Land.HistoryStatistische Mappen, Verbandsgemeinde Kirn-Land, 2009 =Municipality‚Äôs name= The municipality's name appeared in 1380 as Pruwilre and goes back to the base form Brunen-wilre, which can be interpreted as meaning ‚ÄúBruno‚Äôs Estate‚Äù.Municipality‚Äôs name Religion As at 31 August 2013, there are 74 full-time residents in Brauweiler, and of those, 50 are Evangelical (67.568%), 8 are Catholic (10.811%) and 16 (21.622%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Town council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Brauweiler's mayor is Karl-J√ºrgen Barth, and his deputy is Manfried Schacht.Brauweiler‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: Schild geteilt, oben in Schwarz eine goldene Gewandfibel, unten blau-golden geschacht. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess enhanced sable a clothing fibula Or and chequy of twelve azure and Or. The charge in the upper field is a clothing fibula that was unearthed in 1936 during digging work within Brauweiler's limits. It comes from La T√®ne times and is made in the shape of a snake's body with a bird's head. The original piece is now kept at the Romano-Germanic Central Museum in Mainz. The ‚Äúchequy‚Äù pattern below this is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim. Municipal council gave the graphic artist Brust from Kirn-Sulzbach the task of designing a municipal coat of arms. At a council meeting on 12 August 1977, council adopted the design that had been put forth. After consent by the state archive, the Ministry of the Interior in Mainz granted approval for Brauweiler to bear its own arms on 7 December 1977.Description and explanation of Brauweiler‚Äôs arms The arms also appear on the municipal banner.Brauweiler‚Äôs municipal banner Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district Hauptstra√üe 2 ‚Äì former school * Hauptstra√üe 2 ‚Äì former school, one-and-a-half- floor plastered building, 1864 =Clubs= Brauweiler has a local history and cultural club (Heimat- und Kulturverein Brauweiler e.V.).Clubs Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Brauweiler lies off the main road and can only be reached over a winding access road that branches off Bundesstra√üe 421.

Le Guin. It was produced in 1979 as part of New York City public television station WNET's Experimental TV Lab project, and directed by David Loxton and Fred Barzyk. Le Guin, by her own account, was involved in the casting, script planning, re-writing, and filming of the production. The film stars Bruce Davison as protagonist George Orr, Kevin Conway as Dr. William Haber, and Margaret Avery as lawyer Heather LeLache. Plot In Portland, Oregon, in the near future, George Orr is charged with abuse of multiple prescription medications, which he was taking to keep himself from dreaming. Orr volunteers for psychiatric care to avoid prosecution, and is assigned to the care of licensed oneirologist William Haber. Orr's explanation of his drug abuse is incredible: He has known since age 17 that his dreams change reality, and tries to prevent himself from this \\"effective dreaming\\" because he fears their effects. Haber initially considers Orr's fear as a delusional symptom of neurosis or psychosis, referring to him as \\"possibly an intelligent schizophrenic\\". The doctor puts Orr into a hypnotic trance while attached to the \\"Augmentor,\\" a device he has invented for monitoring and enhancing, or augmenting, brainwaves during dreaming, to help with patient therapy. He encourages Orr to have an effective dream, recording his brain function all the while. The world changes slightly during this dream, and Haber realizes that Orr is telling the truth. Haber begins to use Orr's effective dreams, first to create a prestigious, well-funded institute run by himself, then to attempt to solve various social problems. But these solutions unravel quickly: Haber suggests that Orr dream of an answer to overpopulation (resulting in a plague wiping out three-fourths of the human population), the end to all conflict on Earth (resulting in an alien invasion uniting mankind), and an end to racism (resulting in a world where everyone's skin becomes a uniform shade of gray). Only after several failed attempts to \\"make the world right\\" does Haber admit to Orr he believes in Orr's power. Having used the Augmentor to record and analyze Orr's supremely complex dreaming brainwaves, Haber begins creating a machine that will allow him to have his own effective dreams, and remake reality directly. Orr turns to lawyer Heather LeLache for help in getting out of his government-mandated treatments with Haber. LeLache doubts Orr's sanity, but agrees to help him, eventually becoming an ally. Orr falls in love with LeLache. As Haber continues to use Orr's dreams to create change in human society, Orr remembers a dream he experienced years ago, which is briefly portrayed at the opening of the film (and which, it turns out, is in fact reality): The world was destroyed in a nuclear war, and Orr was poisoned by radiation. In his dying moments, Orr dreamed a world where the war did not happen, resulting in the events of the film as we see them. Haber enters the final version of his machine for directing dreams and learns this truth, driving him mad. Orr, who has joined him in the dream state, is able to stop Haber's nightmare before it destroys the world. The result is a reality that jumbles together elements of the different worlds that Haber created via Orr's dreams, but is relatively stable. But he is heartbroken because the LeLache in this reality was never his close friend or lover. As the film ends, Orr is working in an antique store run by an alien. LeLache comes in to browse. She has only a vague memory of him, but agrees to join him for lunch. They encounter a wheelchair-bound Haber on their way to lunch. Haber recognizes Orr, but cannot come out of his catatonia.

Mihailoff as Orderly Behind the scenes Directors David Loxton and Fred Barzyk were pioneers in the early video art movement. They met in 1968 at WGBH TV in Boston and collaborated for over 20 years, until Loxton's death in the early 1990s. The first science fiction drama they created together was a 1972 film called Between Time and Timbuktu, based on the work of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. With a two-week shooting schedule, and a lean budget of about $250,000, Loxton and Barzyk had to get creative to effectively convey The Lathe of Heaven's deeper meanings and sometimes grand science fiction scenarios. In an interview in 2000, Barzyk said: The film was shot at locations in Dallas, Texas, and nearby Fort Worth rather than in Portland, Oregon. These included the Dallas City Hall, the Tandy Center Fort Worth, Hyatt Regency Dallas and Reunion Tower, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the Fort Worth Water Gardens and a vacated Mobil Oil Building in Fort Worth. Le Guin, her husband, their fifteen- year-old son, and her husband's eighty-year-old Aunt Ruby appear as extras in a scene where Heather and George talk over lunch in a cafeteria. According to a 1978 article in The New York Times, during the process of funding a prospective series focused on \\"speculative fiction, a category of fairly recent vintage applied to ... the most thoughtful and provocative works of science fiction ... [such as] Arthur C. Clarke, Frank Herbert, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Anthony Burgess and Robert Heinlein,\\" Le Guin was one of several authors whose novels were considered for adaptation: \\"The [$750,000] financing was awarded as the result of an earlier grant by [the Corporation for Public Broadcasting] to research and develop such a series. After much study with a team of consultants that included critics, authors, editors, publishers and professors, a list of candidates for the series was compiled, from which Miss LeGuin's novel was selected\\" to be the series pilot. At the time this funding was given, it was thought the film would be shot in Portland, Oregon, where the story takes place. Loxton and Barzyk hoped that Lathe would be the first production in a public television series exploring science fiction literature. They created one more telefilm together under this rubric, 1983's Overdrawn at the Memory Bank, based on a short story by John Varley. Reception and awards When it first aired in 1980, The Lathe of Heaven became one of the two highest-rated shows that season on PBS, drawing 10 percent of the audience in New York and 8 percent in Chicago, according to Nielsen ratings. Michael Moore reviewed The Lathe of Heaven in Ares Magazine #1. Moore commented that \\"One hopes some producers who plan yet more clones of Star Wars will have watched Lathe and learned that science fiction does not consist solely of dogfights in space and cardboard heroes facing 'gee-whiz' challenges. The best science fiction, such as Lathe, examines humankind's place in the universe and the products and problems created by intelligence.\\" The Lathe of Heaven was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. The screenplay was nominated for a Writers Guild Award for writers Roger Swaybill and Diane English In 1998, Entertainment Weekly magazine named the 1980 Lathe telefilm one of the top 100 greatest works of science fiction. Of the 2000 re-release (see below), TV Guide wrote, \\"Unlike much current science fiction, it's driven by ideas rather than special effects, and Davison's subtle performance as George, who turns out to be a far tougher character than he at first appears, is a highlight.\\" In Cinescape, a reviewer praised the film as Time magazine wrote: 2000 re-release After its initial broadcast in 1980, Lathe was occasionally shown over the next eight years. PBS' rights to rebroadcast the program expired in 1988. The Lathe of Heaven went on to become the most- requested program in PBS history. Fans were critical of WNET's supposed \\"warehousing\\" of the film, but the budgetary barriers to rebroadcast were high. In a 2000 article, Joseph Basile, director of program rights and clearances for WNET, said, \\"'Lay people don't understand that to take a program out of mothballs, we have to pay for and clear rights with all participants in the program ... It's a difficult and time-consuming and expensive endeavor.\\" Basile also had to negotiate a special agreement with the composer of the film's score, and deal with the Beatles recording excerpted in the original soundtrack, \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", which is integral to a plot point in both the novel and the film. A cover version replaces the Beatles' own recording, \\"which would have taken too long to clear and cost 'an arm and a leg'.\\" Once rights issues were resolved, the film was cleaned up from two-inch Quadruplex videotape copies. In 2000, Lathe was finally rebroadcast and released to video and DVD. In addition to the film, this release features an interview with Ursula K. Le Guin by Bill Moyers, which initially aired along with the film's rebroadcast. The back cover of the DVD notes, ‚ÄúThe original film materials have been lost forever. A new digital master was created from the surviving 2‚Ä≥ tape and was then color corrected using state-of-the-art technology. Ghosting and darkening of the images may appear in some scenes. It is the best quality transfer possible of this important work using the only surviving materials.‚Äù WNET has not said how much it cost to re-release Lathe, stating simply that it \\"wasn't cheap,\\" and that hopefully royalties would help recoup the expense. Pop culture impact Bruce Davison guest-starred in a 1995 episode of the television show The Outer Limits titled \\"White Light Fever\\" which features a visual homage to Lathe: a \\"tunnel of blue light\\" effect very similar to a special effect used near the end of the film. (An image from this sequence is featured on the cover of both the mass market paperback edition of the novel that was issued with the film's premiere, and the 2000 video/DVD release). The novel was again adapted as a telefilm by A&E; Networks in 2002, titled Lathe of Heaven.

She served in the Boer War and was then given to Canada as the second ship of the newly created Naval Service of Canada as HMCS Niobe. The Naval Service of Canada became the Royal Canadian Navy in August 1911. The ship was nearly lost when she went aground off Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia overnight 30‚Äì31 July 1911. Repairs were completed at the end of 1912 and the ship returned to service in late 1914. During the First World War, Niobe patrolled the approaches to the St. Lawrence River and then joined the Royal Navy's 4th Cruiser Squadron to patrol off New York City. The cruiser returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia on 17 July 1915 and never put to sea again. Niobe was paid off in September and served as a depot ship in Halifax. Damaged in the 1917 Halifax Explosion, she was sold for scrap and broken up in the 1920s. Design and description The Diadem-class cruisers were reduced versions of the preceding . The first four ships of the class, of which Niobe was one, displaced and were long between perpendiculars and overall. They had a beam of and a draught of . The first four cruisers of the class were propelled by two shafts powered by steam from 30 Belleville boilers driving a four-cylinder triple expansion engine that created . This gave the ships a maximum speed . The cruisers carried of coal as fuel.Chesneau and Kolesnik, p. 68 The Diadem-class were equipped with sixteen QF guns. Four single-mounted guns with gun shields were placed on the forecastle and quarterdeck, while the remaining twelve were placed in casemates on either side of the ship. The foremost and aftermost guns on each side were mounted in two-story casemates, with the other eight in single-story casemates amidships.Chesneau and Kolesnik, pp. 67‚Äì68 The class was criticised for the lack of heavier armament. The cruisers were given fourteen single-mounted QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval guns and three single- mounted QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. The cruisers also mounted three torpedo tubes, one positioned above water in the stern and two submerged broadside. The cruisers were given a armoured deck and armour for the ammunition hoists. The casemates and the 6-inch gun shields were given armour and the conning tower, . The vessels had a complement of 677 in Royal Navy service. Career Niobe was ordered as part of the 1895/96 Estimates and was laid down by Vickers Limited at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard on 16 December 1895. The cruiser was launched on 20 February 1897,Colledge, p. 444 and commissioned on 6 December 1898. She was part of the Channel Squadron at the outbreak of the Boer War (1899‚Äì1900), and was sent to Gibraltar to escort troop transports ferrying reinforcements to the Cape. On 4 December 1899, Niobe and rescued troops from SS Ismore, which had run aground. Niobe saw further action in the Boer War, escorting troops to Cape Town, and the Queen's South Africa Medal was subsequently awarded to the crew. She returned to the English Channel, but later escorted vessels as far as Colombo in Ceylon. In March 1901 Niobe was one of two cruisers to escort , commissioned as royal yacht for the world tour of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George and Queen Mary), from Spithead to Gibraltar, and in September the same year she again escorted the royal yacht from St. Vincent to Halifax, Nova Scotia. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and the following month visited Souda Bay, Crete for combined monoeuvres with other ships of the Channel and Mediterranean stations. After a brief visit to Gibraltar in early October, she returned to Portsmouth to pay off at Devonport. From 1905 to 1909, Niobe was the flagship of the Rear-Admiral Reserve Squadron and was refitted in 1908. In April 1909, the cruiser was recommissioned into the 4th Division of the Home Fleet at Devonport and was paid off in September 1910.Gardiner and Gray, p. 11 =Royal Canadian Navy= After a series of negotiations between Canada and the Admiralty over the composition of the newly formed Canadian Navy, the Canadians traded their desire for destroyers, of which none were available, for Niobe, which was to form the nucleus of the east coast fleet. The purchase was arranged in January 1910, and to make room for the cost of Niobe, ¬£215,000, a flotilla leader was dropped from the list of requests.Gimblett, p. 9 Niobe and HMS Rainbow were provided to the Dominion of Canada to seed the new Canadian navy. Payment for Niobe was deferred until after the vote on the naval service in the Canadian House of Commons. The Naval Service Act was opposed by the Conservative Party of Canada, then in the role of Official Opposition, pushing instead for Canada to make direct payments to support the Royal Navy. The governing Liberal Party of Canada held the majority of the seats in the Parliament however, and pushed ahead with the initiative to create a Canadian navy. Once terms of purchase were settled, the newly renamed HMCS (His Majesty's Canadian Ship) Niobe was transferred to Canada on 6 September 1910, commissioning at Devonport Dockyard.Johnston et al., p. 225 Before departing Great Britain, Niobe and Rainbow were altered in order to meet the requirement as training vessels for the nascent Canadian navy. This required the installation of new heating systems, an up-to-date galley and the latest in Marconi wireless.Johnston et al., p. 233 Niobe in drydock at Halifax Niobe reached Halifax, Nova Scotia on 21 October that year, her entry into the harbour timed to coincide with Trafalgar Day. Formal transfer of the ship only took place on 12 November 1910, once she had been paid for.Johnston et al., p. 240 After commissioning, the status of the new Canadian vessels and their ability to operate independently of the Royal Navy arose and prevented the ships from leaving coastal waters until the matter was settled.Johnston et al., p. 242 This initially limited Niobe to training duties in Halifax and prevented her from making a tour of the Caribbean Sea. After departing on a training cruise, Niobe ran aground in fog off Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, on the night of 30‚Äì31 July 1911. Damage control saved the ship. The repairs took six months, completing in January 1912, and she had a permanently reduced maximum speed as a result. The resulting court martial found that the navigating officer, Charles White, who had not been on the bridge, should have been present during the navigation of the area due to its difficulty, and also found Captain W. B. MacDonald negligent for not ensuring his officers were performing their duties properly.Johnston et al., p. 251 Having been laid up after repair pending the arrival of the new government,Johnston et al., p. 250 Niobes condition gradually deteriorated. She was effectively rotting at her berth in 1913.Johnston et al., p. 267 However, with the outbreak of the First World War, she was ordered to be brought up to an acceptable state of readiness for combat purposes.Johnston et al., p. 294 This was difficult as her crew had been sent west when she was laid up.Johnston et al., p. 297 To fill in its crew, the sloops and , which had passed into Canadian control, were paid off at Esquimalt, British Columbia and their crews sent east.Gimblett, p. 27 In September 1914, to complete her complement, Niobe travelled to the Dominion of Newfoundland to pick up a contingent of 107 sailors from the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve.Tucker, p. 246 After returning to operational status, Niobe was sent with to patrol the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Following that from 11‚Äì13 September 1914, she escorted The Royal Canadian Regiment, aboard the transport Canada, to Bermuda, where they took up garrison duties. On her return journey the cruiser developed defects and required a week to repair.Johnston et al., p. 325 Those defects prevented the ship from escorting the large troop convoy carrying Canadian soldiers in October.German, p. 40 On 6 October 1914, Niobe joined the Royal Navy's 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station. She was engaged in intercepting German ships along the American coast until July 1915. During this period she chased the German raider into Newport News, Virginia. After refuelling, the raider's captain opted for his vessel to be interned by the Americans instead of fighting the Niobe.Johnston et al., p. 352 As the patrol work continued Niobe began to wear out. Her final patrol was 4‚Äì17 July 1915, after which the cruiser returned to Halifax. Her funnels were found to be rapidly deteriorating, her boilers were worn and her bulkheads were in poor shape.Johnston et al. p. 355 As a result of being worn out, Niobe was paid off on 6 September 1915 to become a depot ship in Halifax. The mascot of HMCS Niobe While Niobes operational life was coming to an end, Vice-Admiral Kingsmill attempted to swap her back to the Royal Navy for a newer cruiser. However, the British only offered , a cruiser in a similar state of repair, and therefore nothing came of the exchange. On 6 December 1917, the ammunition ship was rammed by another vessel. The ramming caused Mont-Blanc to catch fire. Laden with tons of explosives, the ship was abandoned by her crew and left to drift through the harbour. Niobe was laid up in harbour at the time and the alarm was raised aboard the ship once the danger was known. Warrant Officer Albert Mattison and six men sailed to Mont-Blanc in Niobes pinnace and boarded the ammunition ship in an effort to scuttle her. However, while the group was boarding, Mont-Blanc exploded, killing the seven men instantly.German, p. 47 The explosion caused serious damage to Niobe's upper works, and the deaths of seven other crew members.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 12Directorate of History, NDHQ Ottawa 25 May 1973. It also caused her to be dragged from her moorings, despite the use of a concrete embedded anchor. Once re-secured, additional anchors were put in place. She remained in use as a depot ship until disposed of in 1920, and sold for scrap. She was broken up in 1922 in Philadelphia. Legacy As the first large ship in the Royal Canadian Navy, Niobes name has considerable symbolic importance in the Canadian navy, being used among other things as the title of a series of scholarly papers. Models and collections of artefacts of Niobe can be found at several Canadian museums including the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and the Naval Museum of Halifax in Halifax. The latter devotes a room to Niobe which includes her original ship's bell. There is also a Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps located in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia that carries her name as RCSCC 62 NIOBE. On 14 October 2014, an anchor believed to have belonged to Niobe was unearthed at HMC Dockyard in Halifax. The particular anchor, and the location it was discovered, is consistent with being from Niobe. The anchor is believed to be one of her three bow anchors used to secure her in her new position following the Halifax Explosion. On 17 October 2014, Canada announced that 21 October will be recognised annually as \\"Niobe Day\\" to commemorate the ship's arrival in Halifax in 1910.

Atheneum Books) Sons From Afar (1987) is the sixth book in Cynthia Voigt's Tillerman Cycle, the series of novels dealing with Dicey Tillerman's family which also includes Homecoming, Dicey's Song (winner of the 1983 Newbery Medal), The Runner, A Solitary Blue, Come A Stranger, and Seventeen Against the Dealer.  Plot summary  With Dicey and her friends Mina and Jeff away at college, Sons From Afar turns its attention to younger brothers James and Sammy. James is now 15 and wondering about his missing father. He and Sammy begin an investigation across Maryland leading to adventures in Easton, Annapolis, and Baltimore to find clues about the life and character of their father. Sammy at first is uninterested in the man who abandoned their mother and his four children, thinking it has no real bearing on him, but he goes along with James for brotherly support. Their roles eventually become reversed after James has an epiphany about accepting himself for what he is and Sammy realises he needs to start asking questions about himself and where he is heading. Along the way, they find \\"missing men\\" affecting the lives of more and more people, and renew their understanding of their place in their family. = Characters = Abigail \\"Gram\\" Tillerman: The Tillerman children's grandmother, Gram took them in at the end of Homecoming, the first book in the cycle. She is 64 years old and lives on her family farm with her grandchildren. She is an older version of Dicey, her eldest grandchild and sees the good in all the Tillermans. James Tillerman: Now almost 16 years old, James has grown into a quiet, insecure young man who is described as having dark hair, a thin, narrow face, and hazel eyes who looks younger than his age. He is embarrassed by himself, afraid of being labeled a \\"dork\\" or \\"brain\\". He does not share these feelings with his grandmother because he is afraid of worrying her, although Sammy and Maybeth see through James's facade but do not tell him. He has a hard time asking for things from his grandmother or others (for fear that they will say no) and gives up easily. He is highly intelligent, taking all A-track - advanced - courses at the local high school; however, he lacks athletic ability and physical confidence. He fears the pain of injury. Despite this, he has joined the baseball team because he wants to look well-rounded on his college applications. Even though he hates it and wants to quit, he does not because he does not want people to think he is a quitter. During the story James changes his post-high school goal from becoming a lawyer and building up a business to becoming a medical doctor. His part-time job at a doctor's office and his helping diagnose a patient with a bladder problem is a main factor in his change of heart. Throughout most of the book, he is frustrated with Sammy because of his brother's lack of intellectual curiosity and ambition and his stubborn attitude. At the same time, he is envious of his brother's natural athletic ability and self-confidence and self-acceptance. James's respect for Sammy grows when James sees Sammy's bravery and courage when he stands up to a violent grown man at a bar on their search for their father. Even though he never finds his father, James's experiences teach him that he needs to accept himself for who he is so that he does not \\"get lost from himself\\", the way he believes his father had done. It also teaches him to accept his brother. Sammy Tillerman: Now 12 years old, Sammy is described as blond, hazel-eyed, and tall for his age with a stocky athletic build. He looks older than he is. Sammy is his own person and says and does whatever he wants regardless of what others will think of him. Other children at school look up to and admire him, including girls who Sammy ignores as he thinks they are a pain. He likes playing sports and being outside. He prefers physical labor rather than intellectual work. Sammy respects James's \\"book smarts\\" but is often frustrated with James's lack of confidence and constant questioning and thinking. Sammy believes James is not smart about life or people or even himself, and Sammy thinks these are more important. This attitude changes when Sammy sees James remain calm throughout the bar fight, talking the men down until the boys are able to leave. Sammy proposes at the very end, that they team up their strengths to protect Maybeth from men who might ruin her life, the way their father did to their mother. Maybeth Tillerman: Now 14 years old, Maybeth resembles the Tillerman's mother, Liza, in looks and personality. She is described by James as pretty, strong looking, with a good figure. She has a great talent for music and singing; even her voice sounds like her mother's. While having this talent and skills in cooking and sewing, Maybeth struggles to maintain decent grades in all school courses other than home economics. James helps her with homework and studying and he is awed that she does not mind having to work so hard to earn only Cs and Ds. Maybeth is gentle and kind so is popular despite being slow at school. Dicey Tillerman: The oldest of the Tillerman children, Dicey only appears briefly when she comes home from college for spring break. Although she is clever and finds college easy, she thinks it is not worthwhile when she is needed at home and really wants to learn boat building. However, Gram is insistent that Dicey finish college. Dicey is a lot like Sammy: direct and stubborn and impatient with James. She has a take-charge attitude and feels she should be at home to take care of her family.  Literary references  James has to do a report in his French class, and ends up doing a second for another student, leading to guilt about cheating. *Victor Hugo, The Hunchback of Notre Dame *Albert Camus, \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\" (essay) James takes a part-time job in a medical office and answers the distressed call of a man with urinary retention and thinks of an episode in a book he read.

His third memoir, Apology to the Young Addict, is the last of a trilogy dealing with addiction, recovery, and helping others achieve sobriety. His acclaimed first memoir, The Los Angeles Diaries (HarperCollins, 2003), is an intimate portrait of his dysfunctional family, covering his childhood, Hollywood script meetings, his splintered marriage and life with his older brother, the actor Barry Brown (1951‚Äì78), and his sister, the actress Marilyn Brown (1953‚Äì98), who both committed suicide. It was named a Best Book of the Year by Publishers Weekly, The San Francisco Chronicle and The Independent of London.Brown, James. Lives; Detour (excerpt from The Los Angeles Diaries, The New York Times, August 31, 2003. Novels and memoir Living in San Jose, Brown studied creative writing at San Francisco State University and then attended the University of California, Irvine where he received an MFA degree in creative writing. His first novel, Going Fast , published in a limited edition by Border Mountain Press, was reviewed by Merritt Clifton in Samisdat: :\\"Going nowhere at bored and frustrated with school, aware of the world's flaws but feeling helpless to correct them, James Brown's hero/narrator, Virgil, idly picks up a spray paint can and says in bold script what he thinks of it all, on the side of an abandoned building. Accosted by two burly policement, in an instant he is Going Fast. First to reform school, where he meets JT, a confirmed incorrigible. Then into a low-paying, grimy job, living in the San Jose slum. Learning from JT, becoming his partner, Virg gradually claims his own destiny and identity, through ten rapidly moving, freewheeling days in and around San Francisco drug traffic... There are no bad or good guys, angels or devils, only people, who can be and often are both.\\" His second novel, Hot Wire , focuses on the struggles of a waitress and her three sons. The semi- autobiographical Final Performance (Sceptre, 1988), about two brothers in Los Angeles, was reviewed in Library Journal by Kimberly G. Allen, who commented, \\"Its characters imbued with an honest emotional depth, this work is compelling and profoundly moving.\\" He followed with The Second Story Theatre and Two Encores (Story Line collecting together a novella and short stories, \\"The Rat Boy\\" and \\"The Friend.\\" His novel Lucky Town (Harcourt, follows a young boy who runs away from a foster home to meet his ex-con father. When The Los Angeles Diaries was published by HarperCollins in , Publishers Weekly reviewed: :\\"Brown's tales are harrowing: at five, he and his mother traveled from their San Jose home to San Francisco, where she set an apartment building ablaze. Arson couldn't be proven, but she was imprisoned for tax evasion. At nine, he shared his first drink and high with his siblings; when he was a neighbor attempted to molest him; by he was an alcohol- and cocaine-addicted writer-in- residence. During his marriage's early years, Brown often left his wife to feed his addictions, repeatedly promising her he'd reform. Desperate to fuel his writing career, he attempted screenwriting, but everything he pitched seemed too dark. Brown's genius compels readers to sympathize with him in every instance. Juxtaposed with the shimmery unreality of Hollywood, these essays bitterly explore real , an existence careening between great promise and utter devastation. Brown's revelations have no smugness or self- congratulation; they reek of remorse and desire, passion and futility. Brown flays open his own tortured skin looking for what blood beats beneath and why. The result is a grimly exquisite memoir that reads like a noir novel but grips unrelentingly like the hand of a homeless drunk begging for help.\\" His personal essays have appeared in GQ, The New York Times Magazine, The Los Angeles Times Magazine and Ploughshares.http://www.pshares.org/authors/author- detail.cfm?authorID=7235 His writing has also been featured in Denver Quarterly and New England Review. He has been anthologized in Best American Sports Writing of 2006, Fathers and Sons and Sports: An Anthology of Great American Sports Writing (ESPN, 2008). This River (Counterpoint Books, 2011) is a continuation of The Los Angeles Diaries, picking up where the first memoir ended with many of the same themes of family, addiction and recovery. Now in its fifth edition, Counterpoint is also reissuing the trade paperback of Los Angeles Diaries with a new introduction. Brown's third memoir, Apology to the Young Addict (Counterpoint Books, 2020), is the last of a trilogy. His publisher describes it as follows: \\"Now sixty ‚Äï with years of sobriety under his belt‚Äïand the father of three sons, James Brown writes about finding a new path in life, making peace with the family whose ghosts have haunted him, and helping the next generation of addicts overcome their disease. Opening with the tragic tale of an elderly couple consumed by opioid addiction and moving through the horrors of a Las Vegas massacre, these essays draw on Brown‚Äôs personal journey of recovery to illustrate how an individual life, in all its messiness and charm, can offer a blueprint for healing. Evocative and hopeful, Apology to the Young Addict is a reinvention of the recovery memoir and a lasting testimony from a master writing at his peak.\\" Author Jerry Stahl (Permanent Midnight) states: \\"James Brown‚Äôs Apology to the Young Addict does not just breathe new life into addiction writing, it does so with enough grace, heart, and grab-you-by-the-throat style to transcend the genre and qualify as genuine literature. These beautiful essays will serve as balm for survivors of the opioid crisis, those still struggling to make it out, and pretty much anyone else trying to stay sane in these insane times. Prose- wise‚Äïwith all due respect to his late namesake‚ÄïJames Brown has earned his title as the Godfather of Junkie Soul.\\" Awards Brown received the Nelson Algren Award for Short Fiction, a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in fiction writing and a Chesterfield Film Writing Fellowship from Universal/Amblin Entertainment. He was a Visiting Fellow at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference and the Sewanee Writers' Conference. He teaches at California State University, San Bernardino and lives with his wife, Paula Priamos-Brown, in Lake Arrowhead, California.

Names It is sometimes referred to as the (African) rainbow crab, (Nigerian) moon crab or patriot crab. Adults are sometimes labelled as soapdish crabs in the pet industry. This name derives from their aggressive nature as adults and when being shipped to pet stores, they are often packed in soap dishes to prevent them from killing each other. The names moon crab and soapdish crab are sometimes applied to other similar crab species, leading to frequent confusion with other colourful crabs such as the three remaining species of Cardisoma, Gecarcinus ruricola and G. quadratus (all except C. carnifex from the Americas). Distribution Cardisoma armatum originates from coastal regions of western Africa, but it also occurs inland along some deltas (e.g. the Volta river delta), and on islands such as Cape Verde. Description When young, these crabs typically have a blueish/violet carapace, red‚Äìcolored legs, and whitish claws. This coloration usually fades as the animal grows older. They can reach a carapace size of 20 cm across, although captive individuals rarely reach this size. Ecology and life cycle Their diet consists mainly of fruit, vegetation and carrion. They are known to be cannibalistic, and will consume smaller crabs, small reptiles and amphibians, molluscs, fish, and insects if they can catch them. While juvenile and adult crabs spend most of their time on dry land, the females must return to the ocean to release their eggs. The eggs hatch into microscopic larvae, and later on develop into young crabs. If the young do not make landfall by the time they are fully developed they will drown. This is a land crab and cannot remain submerged for long periods. References * Bright, D., & C. Hogue. 1972.

Originally laid down on 25 October 1930 as the steel-hulled fishing trawler MV Illinois by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, she was launched on 19 March 1931 and delivered on 30 March 1931 to the Booth Fisheries Company, Boston, Massachusetts. Acquired by the U.S. Navy on 9 August 1940 and renamed Albatross on 14 August 1940, conversion to a minesweeper began on 6 September 1940 by the General Ship and Engine Works, East Boston, Massachusetts. The ship was commissioned as USS Albatross (AM-71) on 8 November 1940 at the Boston Navy Yard. Conversion was completed on 8 November 1941. She was reclassified as an Unclassified Miscellaneous Auxiliary, IX-171, 1 June 1944. Service history = World War II North Atlantic operations= Following her conversion for naval service as a minesweeper Albatross was assigned to duty in the 5th Naval District. In early May 1941, she sailed to Bermuda, arriving at Port Royal Bay on 9 May. The ship operated in Bermudan waters until 15 August, when she got underway for Norfolk, Virginia. After a period of upkeep, she returned to her minesweeping activities in the Hampton Roads area. On 12 December, she set sail for Newfoundland, arriving at Argentia, Newfoundland, on 23 December 1941. = Iceland Area operations= Albatross left that port on 4 January 1942 in company with to join a British convoy bound for Iceland. En route to the rendezvous, the ships encountered heavy weather which forced them to change their course; and they reached Derry, Northern Ireland, on 16 January. Although Albatross had sustained minor damage, she was sent to Iceland via northern Scotland, Orkney, Shetland, and Faroe Islands. The minesweeper finally returned to the United States in July, when she arrived at the Boston Navy Yard. She left Boston as an escort for a convoy on 1 October and reached Greenland on 21 October. Albatross spent the remainder of the year in waters around Greenland. = Albatross strikes an iceberg = USS Albatross struck an iceberg on 7 January 1943, causing minor damage. Then an ice pack formed astern of the ship, blocking the ship's path until shifting winds cleared the ice, enabling her to leave Greenland on 12 January. She touched at Newfoundland on 3 February and then proceeded on to Boston, Massachusetts, arriving on the 8th. Albatross reached Norfolk, Virginia, on the 11th. After a month's overhaul, she got underway for Canada. = Collision with another ship = On 11 April, while operating out of Nova Scotia, Albatross was struck by another ship and suffered damage which caused her to return to Boston, Massachusetts, for a drydock period. When this was completed, the minesweeper returned to Greenland to resume her convoy duties. = Stranded in Greenland = Albatross spent the first six months of 1944 moored to the pier at Narsarssuak, Greenland, awaiting repairs to her main engine which were held up for lack of spare parts. While she was thus immobilized, she provided repairs and services to other ships. On 1 June, Albatross was redesignated IX-171. When her engine was finally back in working order, she headed home and arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, on 14 July. Then the minesweeper reported to the 1st Naval District for inactivation. = End- of-War decommissioning = Stripped of her military equipment, she was decommissioned on 11 September, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 23 September 1944. Albatross was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 15 November 1944 for disposal. She then resumed the name MV Illinois, but no record of her subsequent career has been found.

Le Guin and a remake of the 1980 adaptation. It was produced for the A&E; network in 2002. The film was written and directed by Alan Sharpe and Philip Haas. It was nominated for the 2003 Saturn Award for Best Single Program Presentation. Synopsis Lathe of Heaven stars James Caan, Lukas Haas, and Lisa Bonet. Unlike the 1980 adaptation, it discards a significant portion of the plot, some minor characters, and much of the philosophical underpinnings of the book. The alien invasion and the racial equalization were removed for this adaptation. The film takes place in a futuristic society, where a young man named George Orr (Lukas Haas) overdoses using someone else's pharmacy card. Orr is troubled by his dreams, and is implied to be suicidal because of them. He takes drugs to avoid having these dreams. After he is caught overdosing, his attorney Heather Lelache (Lisa Bonet) sends him to a psychologist as a punishment. The psychologist, William Haber (James Caan), uses a machine called an \\"augmentor\\" to delve deep into Orr's mind. The augmentor looks like a dentist's chair. It is soon obvious that Haber has sinister intentions. He begins to hypnotize Orr into dreaming about a horse in a field. When Orr wakes up from his hypnosis- induced dream, an image of Lady Godiva on a horse is now painted on the wall in the office. Haber then begins to use Orr's power for his own personal gain. At one point, he changes his status from an M.D. to a highly renowned researcher.

Mathieu differential equations  Mathieu's equation is related to the wave equation for the elliptic cylinder. In 1868, the French mathematician √âmile L√©onard Mathieu introduced a family of differential equations nowadays termed Mathieu equations.√â. Mathieu, M√©moire sur le mouvement vibratoire d'une membrane de forme elliptique, J. Math. Pures Appl., vol.13, 1868, pp. 137-203. Given a \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}, the Mathieu equation is given by : \\\\frac {d^2 y} {dw^2} +(a-2q \\\\cos 2w )y=0. The Mathieu equation is a linear second-order differential equation with periodic coefficients. For q = 0, it reduces to the well-known harmonic oscillator, a being the square of the frequency.N.W. McLachlan, Theory and Application of Mathieu Functions, New York: Dover, 1964. The solution of the Mathieu equation is the elliptic-cylinder harmonic, known as Mathieu functions. They have long been applied on a broad scope of wave-guide problems involving elliptical geometry, including: # analysis for weak guiding for step index elliptical core optical fibres # power transport of elliptical wave guides # evaluating radiated waves of elliptical horn antennas # elliptical annular microstrip antennas with arbitrary eccentricity u) # scattering by a coated strip.  Mathieu functions: cosine-elliptic and sine-elliptic functions  In general, the solutions of Mathieu equation are not periodic. However, for a given q, periodic solutions exist for infinitely many special values (eigenvalues) of a. For several physically relevant solutions y must be periodic of period \\\\pi or 2\\\\pi. It is convenient to distinguish even and odd periodic solutions, which are termed Mathieu functions of first kind. One of four simpler types can be considered: Periodic solution (\\\\pi or 2\\\\pi) symmetry (even or odd). For q e 0, the only periodic solutions y corresponding to any characteristic value a=a_r(q) or a=b_r(q) have the following notations: ce and se are abbreviations for cosine-elliptic and sine-elliptic, respectively. > *Even periodic solution: :: ce_r(\\\\omega,q)= \\\\sum_m A_{r,m} \\\\cos {m > \\\\omega}\\\\text{ for }a=a_r(q) *Odd periodic solution: :: se_r(\\\\omega,q)= > \\\\sum_m A_{r,m} \\\\sin {m \\\\omega}\\\\text{ for }a=b_r(q) where the sums are taken over even (respectively odd) values of m if the period of y is \\\\pi (respectively 2\\\\pi). Given r, we denote henceforth A_{r,m} by A_m, for short. Interesting relationships are found when q \\\\to 0, r e 0: : \\\\lim_{q \\\\to 0} ce_r(\\\\omega,q)= \\\\cos {r \\\\omega} : \\\\lim_{q \\\\to 0} se_r(\\\\omega,q)= \\\\sin {r \\\\omega} Figure 1 shows two illustrative waveform of elliptic cosines, whose shape strongly depends on the parameters u and q. Figure 1. Some plots of 2\\\\pi-periodic 1st kind even Mathieu functions. Elliptic cosines shape for the following set of parameters: a) u=1=and q = 5 ; b) u=5=and q = 5.  Multiresolution analysis filters and Mathieu's equation  Wavelets are denoted by \\\\psi(t) and scaling functions by \\\\phi(t), with corresponding spectra \\\\Psi(\\\\omega) and \\\\Phi(\\\\omega), respectively. The equation \\\\phi(t)= \\\\sqrt {2} \\\\sum_{n \\\\in Z} h_n \\\\phi(2t-n), which is known as the dilation or refinement equation, is the chief relation determining a Multiresolution Analysis (MRA). H(\\\\omega)= \\\\frac {1} {\\\\sqrt 2} \\\\sum_{k \\\\in Z} h_k e^{j \\\\omega k} is the transfer function of the smoothing filter. G(\\\\omega)= \\\\frac {1} {\\\\sqrt 2} \\\\sum_{k \\\\in Z} g_k e^{j \\\\omega k} is the transfer function of the detail filter. The transfer function of the \\"detail filter\\" of a Mathieu wavelet is : G_{ u}(\\\\omega)=e^{j( u-2)[ \\\\frac {\\\\omega - \\\\pi} {2}]}. \\\\frac {ce_{ u} ( \\\\frac {\\\\omega-\\\\pi} {2},q)} {{ce_{ u}(0,q)}}. The transfer function of the \\"smoothing filter\\" of a Mathieu wavelet is : H_{ u}(\\\\omega)=-e^{j u [ \\\\frac {\\\\omega} {2}]}. \\\\frac {ce_{ u}( \\\\frac {\\\\omega} {2},q)} {{ce_{ u}(0,q)}}. The characteristic exponent u should be chosen so as to guarantee suitable initial conditions, i.e. G_{ u}(0)=0 and G_{ u}(\\\\pi)=1, which are compatible with wavelet filter requirements. Therefore, u must be odd. The magnitude of the transfer function corresponds exactly to the modulus of an elliptic-sine: Examples of filter transfer function for a Mathieu MRA are shown in the figure 2. The value of a is adjusted to an eigenvalue in each case, leading to a periodic solution. Such solutions present a number of u zeroes in the interval 0 \\\\le \\\\omega  \\\\le \\\\pi.

The G and H filter coefficients of Mathieu MRA can be expressed in terms of the values \\\\\\\\{ A_{2 l +1} \\\\\\\\}_{l \\\\in Z} of the Mathieu function as: : \\\\frac {h_l} {\\\\sqrt{2}}=- \\\\frac {A_{2l+1}/2} {ce_{ u}(0,q)} : \\\\frac {g_l} {\\\\sqrt{2}}=(-1)^l \\\\frac {A_{2l-3}/2} {ce_{ u}(0,q)} There exist recurrence relations among the coefficients: : (a-1-q)A_1-qA_3 =0 : (a-m^2)A_m-q(A_{m-2}+A_{m+2} =0 for m \\\\ge 3, m odd.

Infinite Impulse Response filters (IIR filter) should be use since Mathieu wavelet has no compact support. Figure 3 shows emerging pattern that progressively looks like the wavelet's shape.

It links to the M-2 Motorway, the M-11 Motorway, and the N5 National Highway. A section of the Lahore Ring Road. Lahore ring road L-20 Route The road encircles Lahore. Its route is from Babu Sabu to Saggian Interchange, Lahore, Niazi Chowk. From there it runs to Mehmood Booti, passing through GT road, Canal Bank Road, Harbanspura Interchange, Barki Road, Abdullah Gul Interchange, Allama Iqbal International Airport, Ghazi Road, DHA Phase V & VII, Sui Gas Society, Ferozpur Road, to Hudaira Drain (South) to Halloki, Bahria Town to Niaz Biag. An emergency lane is present on both sides of the road. It is estimated that 425,000 vehicles pass through daily. All linking roads with Lahore Ring Road were to be improved and widened. As many as 20 interchanges were to be erected. Features Map of Lahore showing major roads The project includes the construction of a six-lane divided carriageway, interchanges, RCC bridges, reinforced earth abutments/walls, overhead pedestrian bridges, culverts, sub-ways, underpasses, flyovers and related works. Length: 85 km Lanes: 6 Speed limit: minimum speed is 80km/hr, maximum speed is 100km/h for heavy transport vehicles and 120km/h for light transport vehicles Separation: central raised concrete median and grade- separated junctions Access: restricted to fast moving vehicles only, including high-performance heavy bikes. The road is fenced on either side. Pedestrians, bicycles, low-performance motorcycles, animal-driven carriages, and other slow-moving vehicles are not permitted. History The project was conceived in 1992. The six-lane road (177 kilometres) was estimated to cost Rs 117 billion. The eventual ring road, with six lanes stretching out to 443 km, comes at the cost of Rs 185 billion while the same road with 177 km will cost approximately Rs 1150 billion. Changes in government caused delays and changes in the project and the total cost estimates shot up due to increased land acquisition, improvement of existing roads used in the project, shifting of utility installations, protecting commercial and residential areas and improvements to junctions. Explanations for the overrun included delays from lack of professional capabilities, loose checks and balances and the absence of third-party oversight. Contracts were awarded to handpicked contractors without first acquiring the land. The project was the largest development scheme in the history of the metropolis. Usually, land is acquired by LDA land acquisition collector, and EDO revenue, but in this project the Board of Revenue was exclusively involved in acquiring the land. Studies were carried out on the road over this period. The road was designed and redesigned, considering the political and economic interests of the ruling party. In 1991, the Japan International Cooperation Agency proposed a road-loop in the city and the World Bank prepared a feasibility report on a 60 km ring road. In 1995, the Lahore Development Authority presented its scheme. At that time, Daewoo and other foreign companies had signed a memorandum of understanding with the LDA. In 2003, President Pervez Musharraf directed the Punjab government to implement the project. The project was launched on December 22, 2004 at a ground-breaking ceremony attended by President Musharaf. The Punjab Communication & Works Department Project Management Unit awarded the ‚ÄúLahore Ring Road Southern Loop Feasibility Study and Selection of Route‚Äù to NESPAK in December 2007. This project was awarded to National Logistics Cell in February 2009, which subcontracted the first phase (Package 4, Saggian Interchange) to Habib Construction Services.http://www.hcs.com.pk Habib Construction Services HCS completed this phase in May 2009. The scope of work included a route alignment study, traffic study, environmental impact assessment, project cost estimates, as well as an economic and financial evaluation. The work on the Southern Loop was to start in 2010, but funding problems delayed matters. The start date was pushed 2011. As of 2010 30% of the work on the first phase of the road, from Niazi Chowk to Bund Road, (43 kilometres) was nearing completion. Work on the Southern Loop was also delayed until 2011 and then until 2016. The Kamahan to Adda secgment was inaugurated on 22 December 2017. The southern Loop hosts housing societies that will be linked, such as DHA, Sui Gas Housing Society, Eden Park (adjacent to Lahore Wildlife Park), State Life Housing Society, Eden Gardens, Valencia, Khayaban-e-Amin, Lake City, AWT Scheme, Fazaia Housing Scheme and Bahria Town.

Biography  Chernin was born on May 7, 1940, in the Bronx, New York. Her parents, Rose Chernin and Paul Kusnitz, were Russian-born Jewish immigrants. Rose Chernin was an organizer for the Communist Party and founded the Los Angeles Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born. Paul Kusnitz was a teacher of Marxism for the Communist Party. Chernin's childhood was influenced by the death of her older sister, Nina, to Hodgkin's lymphoma. Shortly after Nina's death, the Kusnitz family relocated to Los Angeles to be near relatives. Her mother resumed full-time work as a party organizer and in 1951 made national headline news when she was arrested for \\"advocating the overthrow of the government.\\" Rose Chernin was later called before the House Un-American Activities Committee for her work as a party organizer. The U.S. government tried unsuccessfully to denaturalize her and deprive her of citizenship for such activities.Jewish Women's Encyclopedia accessed August 18, 2009 Kim Chernin was active as an organizer of the LYL Labor Youth League and, upon graduation from high school, traveled to Moscow for the Seventh World Festival of Youth and Students. In her memoir, In My Mother's House, Chernin writes: Chernin moved to Berkeley to attend the University of California, Berkeley and married David Netboy at the age of 18. In 1963, her only child, Larissa, was born while she was studying at Trinity College, Dublin.Jewish Women's Encyclopedia accessed August 17, 2009 She divorced seven years later, subsequently also marrying and divorcing Robert Cantor, before settling into a long-term relationship with her life-companion Renate Stendhal, with whom she co-wrote Sex and Other Sacred Games, Cecilia Bartoli: The Passion of Song and Lesbian Marriage: A Love & Sex Forever Kit. She currently lives in Point Reyes, California, where she writes and works as a pastoral counselor. She was a guest instructor at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute.HarperCollins Publishers Biography, accessed August 17, 2009 She has been featured on radio, including National Public Radio. She is the recipient of an NEA grant for fiction. Writing Kim Chernin's work spans a number of different genres: memoir, fiction, poetry, psychological study, and a study of women's search for self. Chernin has written a trilogy of books about women and eating disorders, Obsession: Reflections on the Tyranny of Slenderness, The Hungry Self: Women, Eating and Identity, and Reinventing Eve: Modern Woman in Search of Herself. In The Flame Bearers, which was a 1987 New York Times Notable Book,New & Noteworthy, New York Times, accessed August 18, 2009 Chernin challenges women's exclusion from traditional Judaism. Chernin creates the Flame Bearers, a sect of women who are Jewish, yet not traditional observers; when these women read the Holy Book, they reconstruct Old Testament stories to reassert the days before women were excluded from Orthodoxy. In My Mother's House describes the mother-to-daughter bonding between generations of Chernin women, effected through Rose's telling of tales and through daughter Kim's ability to set them down. Of In My Mother's House, Chernin says: \\"Writing that book I was ... preoccupied with the struggle to be different from my mother.\\"In the House of the Flame Bearers, p 56 Cecilia Bartoli: The Passion of Song is a biography of Cecilia Bartoli, the opera singer and recitalist, written with Renate Stendhal.

Service Organized in Detroit, Michigan, the 5th Michigan Cavalry was mustered into service on August 30, 1862, and left for Washington, D.C., on December 4 of that year. The regiment served in the defenses of the capital until June 1863, when it joined the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. Over the next month, the 5th Michigan Cavalry took part in several major battles, including the Battle of Hanover on June 30, the Battle of Gettysburg from July 1 to July 3, and the Battle of Williamsport from July 6 to July 14. The regiment then participated in a series of smaller engagements followed by the Battle of Mine Run from November 26 to December 2. Early in 1864 came the Battle of Morton's Ford, on February 6 and 7, and three months later the Overland Campaign began. The 5th Michigan saw action in several battles of this campaign, including the Battle of the Wilderness on May 6 and 7, the Battle of Totopotomoy Creek from May 28 to 31, and the Battle of Cold Harbor from May 31 to June 1. After the First Battle of Deep Bottom on July 27 and 28, the unit was ordered back towards Washington, D.C., to take part in Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign from August to October. The 5th Michigan saw action in the Battles of Trevilian Station, Opequon, Fisher's Hill, and Cedar Creek. The next spring, in late March and early April 1865, the regiment took part in a series of battles of the Appomattox Campaign: at Dinwiddie Court House, Five Forks, Sayler's Creek, Appomattox Station, and finally Appomattox Court House, which ended with the surrender of the Confederate Army. After participating in one last expedition, the regiment headed to Washington in May, where it took part in the Grand Review of the Armies. The regiment was moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, on June 1 before being mustered out of service on June 23, 1865.

Among the initial officers of the regiment was William d'Alton Mann, a future newspaper and magazine publisher. Future United States Representative from Michigan Jonas H. McGowan served in the 5th until November 1862, when he accepted a captaincy in the 9th Michigan Cavalry. A 5th Michigan cavalryman was responsible for the death of Confederate Major General J.E.B. Stuart; during the Battle of Yellow Tavern, Private John A. Huff of Company E shot and mortally wounded the general. Three men earned the Medal of Honor while serving with the 5th Michigan Cavalry. Captain Smith H. Hastings of Company M was awarded the medal for his actions during an engagement in Newby's Crossroads, Virginia, on July 24, 1863. Two enlisted men, Corporal Gabriel Cole of Company I and Sergeant Henry M. Fox of Company M, received the medal for capturing battle flags during the Battle of Opequon at Winchester, Virginia, on September 19, 1864. Crawley P. Dake raised a company of volunteers for the 5th Michigan Cavalry. He was later a U.S Marshal in the Arizona Territory from 1878 to 1882 noted for introducing new techniques and helping to improve working relationships between law enforcement officers.

It is not known if there was an intended relationship between the ditch and the heelstone although it is likely that the stone was in place either before or at the same time as the ditch. It has steep sloping sides which end at a narrow flat base, and is approximately 4 ft (1.2m) deep and 3.5 ft (1.1m) wide. It is some 12 ft (3.7m) from base the base of the Heelstone, with a diameter of roughly 32 ft (9.7m). A broad arcing trench found in 1923 by Lt-Col William Hawley 9 ft (2.7m) wide cuts this ditch from the West, deepening towards the stone. Against the Heelstone Ditch (inside circle) is rammed chalk filled Stonehole 97, whose missing stone is known as Heelstone's twin although it is possible that the stone in Stonehole 97 was moved and is now the stone known as the Heelstone. The ditch was probably dug after the stone in Stonehole 97 was moved but possibly before that. Only a small part of the Heelstone Ditch, immediately behind the Highways Agency A344 roadside fence, now remains unexplored or undisturbed. General nature of the ditch and fill described in 1979 by Michael W. Pitts, et al. , compares well with Hawley's (1923, 1925).

Manns graduated from Lufkin High School in 1995 where he rushed for 2,000 yards his senior year and led the Panthers to the 1994 5A quarterfinals. Manns‚Äô number (#33) is the first (and currently the only) football number to ever be retired at Lufkin High School. He then played football for New Mexico State University 1995-1998 where he achieved his NCAA rushing record and still holds the school's career rushing record with 4,962 yards. Manns is one of only five players in NCAA Division I-A history to rush for at least 1,000 yards in four consecutive seasons.  College  As a senior at New Mexico State University (in Las Cruces, NM) in 1998, Manns was the co-offensive Big West Conference MVP after rushing for a school record 1,469 yards. On Oct.31, 1998, Manns ran for 131 yards against Utah State to become just the third player in NCAA Division I-A history to surpass 1,000 yards in four consecutive seasons. As a junior, Manns was a first team all- league pick after rushing for 1,017 yards despite missing a game due to injury and played hobbled in the final three games of the season. He ran for a career-high 221 yards in the Aggies‚Äô 28-18 win over Cal State Northridge. It was his third 200-yard game of his career, setting a school record. During his sophomore season, Manns put together his second 1,000-yard season by rushing for Big West Conference leading 1,086 yards. His most productive game was a 205-yard day in a 52-21 win over Southern Utah. He was a first team All-Big West Conference pick. In his debut season as an Aggie, Manns concluded the season with 1,120 rushing yards and seven touchdowns. He had the most yards rushing for any true freshman in the nation, led all freshmen by averaging 153 all-purpose yards per game and set a Big West Conference record for rushing yards by a freshman. Manns also set the Big West Conference record for average yards per carry at 7.1. He was the first player at NMSU to rush for over 1,000 yards in 21 years. In 2005, at the age of 28, Manns was inducted into the Aggie Hall of Fame. In 2008, Manns will be inducted into the Aggie Ring of Honor, alongside fellow Aggie standouts Pervis Atkins and Walt Williams. Personal In June 2002 Denvis and his longtime girlfriend Tamie welcomed their first daughter Maliyah Jenea. In September 2004 Denvis and Tamie were married in a small ceremony. In March 2005 the couple welcomed their second daughter, Marleigh Jade. The Manns family currently lives in Los Lunas, NM.  Professional  Manns attended the Dallas Cowboys' training camp in both 1999 and 2001 as a free agent. He played in NFL Europa for the Barcelona Dragons in 2000 and the Frankfurt Galaxy in 2001. In 2005, Manns was inducted into the NMSU Athletics Hall of Fame. In 2002 Manns switched gears and began to teach and coach football as an assistant at Los Lunas High School. Five years later, in 2007, Manns became the interim head football coach at Los Lunas High School and this past season he was named the head football coach for the Los Lunas Tigers in Los Lunas, New Mexico. Manns is also the head track coach at Los Lunas High School. The Tigers did not go to the playoffs after Manns took over as head coach just prior to the start of the 2007-08 season, but he did lead the team to four wins, one more than the team had in 2006-07, including an exciting 30-27 overtime win over Rio Grande High School on Oct. 11, 2007.

He was the first lieutenant governor of Colorado to be elected governor. John Charles Vivian was born in Golden, Colorado, on June 30, 1887. The Vivian family was very prominent in Republican politics, of Cornish origin.White, G. Pawley, A Handbook of Cornish Surnames.(These Vivians mentioned by Rowse) Vivian received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Colorado in 1909 and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Denver School of Law in 1913. Vivian married Maude Charlotte Kleyn, a professor from the University of Michigan School of Music. Vivian served in the United States Marines during World War I and became the Jefferson County Attorney in 1922. John Vivian was elected Lieutenant Governor of Colorado in 1938. In 1942, Republican Party officials decided to nominate Vivian for governor instead of incumbent Colorado Governor Ralph Lawrence Carr, who had angered many with his opposition to the internment of Japanese-American citizens. Vivian was elected governor in 1942 and was reelected in 1944. Governor Vivian was a staunch fiscal conservative in both public policy and his personal life. He was labeled \\"our spend nothing governor\\" by both opponents and supporters. Vivian died in Golden, Colorado, on February 10, 1964, at the age of seventy-six.

The Chester‚ÄìHadlyme ferry is a seasonal ferry crossing the Connecticut River between the town of Chester, Connecticut and the village of Hadlyme (in the town of Lyme, Connecticut). It is the second oldest continuously operating ferry service in the state of Connecticut and is a designated state historical landmark. The ferry is part of the scenic portion of Route 148 and provides a convenient link between two of Connecticut's tourist attractions: Gillette Castle State Park in Hadlyme and the Essex Steam Train, which runs between Essex and Chester. Operations The Chester‚ÄìHadlyme Ferry operates during the daytime between April 1 and November 30.Connecticut Department of Transportation: Chester- Hadlyme Ferry The toll for cars is $5 on weekdays or $6 on weekends, and it is $2 for cyclists and pedestrians. For frequent vehicle commuters, a discounted rate of $2.50 is available through the use of pre-purchased coupons. The current ferry boat is named Selden III, measuring 65 feet by 30 feet, and can accommodate 8 to 9 cars and 49 passengers. The crossing usually takes about five minutes. An average of 100 vehicles use the ferry every day. History Jonathan Warner of Chester, who owned land on both sides of the river, started a ferry service at this location in 1769. It was then known as Warner's Ferry and utilized a raft propelled using a nail and long poles. Warner's Ferry was the seventh ferry that was established in the Lower Connecticut River Valley.G.S. Roberts, Historic Towns of the Connecticut River Valley, (Robson & Adee, Schenectady, 1906), p.127 Before it was established, travelers and goods needing to be ferried across this reach of the river could cross downstream between Saybrook and Old Lyme, which were connected by ferry as early as 1662, or upstream at Haddam and East Haddam, where a ferry began operating as early as 1664. The ferry was often used throughout the American Revolution to transport supplies across the Connecticut River. Between 1834 and 1846, Warner's Ferry became the terminus for two turnpikes - the Hadlyme Turnpike and the Chester and North Killingworth Second Turnpike - both chartered with the hope of creating a direct, straight-line route between New Haven and Norwich.F.J. Wood, The Turnpikes of New England, (Marshall Jones, Boston, 1919), p.405-406 In 1877, Warner's Ferry came under the supervision of the Town of Chester. Soon after this, a steam-powered barge was put in service and the ferry was renamed the Chester‚ÄìHadlyme Ferry. The Connecticut state government took over operations in 1917 after the Connecticut General Assembly passed laws assigning all river crossings to the Highway Department in 1915; currently the Connecticut Department of Transportation operates the ferry.History of the Connecticut Department of Transportation, Chapter 1 The Hadlyme Ferry Historic District, which includes the ferry slip and 6 buildings on the east side of the crossing, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The Ferry was to be closed by the state on August 25, 2011 as part of the state budget cuts. The move to close the ferry was widely unpopular in surrounding towns and grassroots efforts began to save the ferry. Some residents believe that there are several state statutes that could possibly prevent the ferry from being closed. The state government rescinded its decision to close ferry service, and hence, it continues to run.

The Iranians launched their offensive on March 11 and succeeded in capturing a part of the Baghdad‚ÄìBasra highway. The following Iraqi counterattack, however, forced the Iranians out in a continual war of endless stalemate. Prelude After its failure to capture Basra in 1982, Iran launched Operation Kheibar in 1984 to capture the Baghdad-Basra highway. This resulted in the Battle of the Marshes, and the operation failed, but Iran planned for Operation Badr in a further attempt to capture it. Without coincidence, the operation was named after the Prophet Mohammed's first military victory in Mecca centuries before. The aim of the offensive was focused on capturing the Baghdad-Basra highway, which was a vital link between the two major cities, and for the movement of military supplies and vehicles to support and replenish the Iraqi defenders at the front-line. Another objective included the crossing of the Tigris River, which would cut off Basra from Iraq and give an equally psychological blow to the country. This operation was similar to Operation Kheibar, except it consisted of far superior planning. Iran used 100,000 troops, and 60,000 more in reserve. Iran assessed the marshy terrain and plotted points where to land tanks. Iran also would construct pontoon bridges across the marshes. The Basij forces were also equipped with anti-tank weapons. Iran found itself reorganizing the Pasdaran and Basij units into more conventional forces as a response to several failures in the past. Although highly motivated and outnumbering the Iraqis, the Iranians were poorly trained and lacked heavy equipment, including armor, artillery, and air support to back up the operation. At the same time, Iran was also suffering the effects of the U.S.'s Operation Staunch embargo. Conversely, the Iraqis, under command of General Hisham al-Fakhri, had the luxury of better equipment, better training, and the illegal use of poison gas. The battle On March 11, Iran sent in a force of 100,000 men to attack the vicinity of Majnoon Island; this force landed at al-Qurnah, where the Tigris River skirts the highway and made a charge for it, succeeding in its partial capture, in response to which Iraq opened a counterattack with artillery, air strikes and armor divisions from the north. This battle was the first time that units of the Republican Guard were employed as reserve forces. The Iranians attacked from the Majnoun Islands, once again taking the Iraqis by surprise, striking at the southern end of Iraq's 4th army corps, on a 12 km wide front. The sheer ferocity of the Iranian offensive broke through the Iraqi lines, the Revolutionary Guard, with the support of tanks and artillery broke through the north of Qurna on 14 March. Two days into the offensive, the Iranians penetrated 16 km (10 miles) into Iraq; that same night 30,000 Iranian troops reached the Tigris River and crossed it using three pontoon bridges, one of which was capable of supporting heavy vehicles. Thus they succeeded in capturing part of the Baghdad-Basra Highway 6, which had eluded them during Operations Dawn 5 and Dawn 6;[28] however, while being successful the Iranians had dangerously overextended themselves, and were still suffering from shortages of armor. Saddam responded by launching chemical attacks (tabun agent) against the Iranian positions along the highway and by initiating the second \\"war of the cities\\", with an air and missile campaign against twenty Iranian population centres, including Tehran.[23] The Iraqis had attempted to cause heavy Iranian casualties during the battle by channeling their infantry into pre-set artillery 'kill zones'; this counterattack was launched after the Iranians had reached their objective. Under General Sultan Hashim Ahmad al-Tai and General Jamal Zanoun (two of their most skilled commanders), the Iraqis launched air and artillery attacks against the Iranian positions, pinning them down; this was followed by a massive pincer attack against the Iranians, using mechanized infantry and tanks.[28] The battle came to a climax when Saddam Hussein ordered the use of chemical attacks to evict the Iranians; the Iraqis also flooded the Iranian trenches with specially constructed pipes, diverting water from the Tigris River. Under such heavy pressure the Iranians were forced to retreat. Helicopters also inflicted heavy losses on the retreating forces, forcing them back to the Hoveyzeh marshes and destroying the pontoon bridges. By March 16, all of the Iranian forces had retreated back to the marshes. A short time after the initial attack on the highway, Iran had planned to launch a diversionary one against another area, but it began too late and it too was defeated. Thus the Iranians were eventually driven out of their positions, and the highway retaken by the Iraqis; however, the latter sustained massive losses in the air as a result. Operation Badr resulted in 10,000 casualties for Iraq and 15,000 casualties for Iran and the Iraqi counterattacks were able to force the Iranians back to their previous lines, sustaining almost as heavy casualties as the Iranians. Aftermath In response to Operation Badr, Saddam opened the second \\"War of the Cities\\" during March that year, hitting cities as far as Isfahan, Tabriz, Shiraz, and even Tehran. Iran responded in kind with attacks of her own against Iraq, mostly by launching shells and medium range missiles at the port city of Basra. While Iran had not succeeded due to the shortages of Iranian armor and air power, it convinced the Iranian leadership that their tactics were still good, as they had managed to get so far into Iraq. The Iraqis were also convinced their tactics were sound as well. Iran's weakness would remain lack of heavy equipment, and they would suffer during Iraqi counterattacks with heavy weapons. With experiences gained during this battle and the earlier Battle of the Marshes, Iran launched the successful Operation Dawn 8, capturing the Faw Peninsula.

History Condor 10 was built in 1992 by Incat in Hobart, Australia as Condor Ten but was renamed Condor 10 shortly after. She entered service with Condor Ferries between Weymouth and the Channel Islands in April 1993 replacing the smaller passenger only Condor 9. With Condor 10, Condor Ferries captured a significant share of the Channel Island passenger market which resulted in the closure and sale of British Channel Island Ferries which operated from Poole in 1994. Condor 10 continued to operate for Condor Ferries until October 1994. In December of that year she arrived in New Zealand on charter to Tranz Rail for the Interislander service. For this service the ship carried the marketing name The Lynx but her official name remained as Condor 10.Intelligence Railway Gazette International February 1995 page 74 After completing her first successful summer season in New Zealand, Condor 10 returned to the Northern Hemisphere to operate for Viking Line under the marketing name of Viking Express 1. This began a pattern of the ship operating under charter in both hemispheres for their respective summer seasons which lasted until 1999. Condor 10 returned to New Zealand again for the 1995/1996 summer season before heading north once again this time on charter to Stena Line for their Fishguard-Rosslare service. After further service in New Zealand, Condor 10 was expected to return to Condor Ferries in 1997 for a new service between Weymouth and Saint-Malo via Guernsey but Holyman required the ship for its new Holyman Sally service between Ramsgate and Dunkirk. This service was not successful and only lasted until October 1997. After yet another season of operating in New Zealand in late 1997 early 1998 the ship returned to Weymouth where she was laid up until being required by Tranz Rail one final time. After 1999 Condor 10s place on the Lynx service was taken by Condor Vitesse. After her service on the Interislander, she was briefly chartered by TT-Line for service between Devonport and Melbourne after the Spirit of Tasmania was forced to be laid up for repairs due to fuel contamination after which Condor 10 was laid up at the Incat yard in Hobart in 1999. After years of lay up Condor 10 was refurbished in 2002 for use once again by Condor Ferries, she was delivered to them in Poole where she was prepared for service. She was placed on the Saint-Malo-Channel Islands run replacing Condor 9 once again. Condor's use of the Condor 10 on the St Malo-Channel Islands route and their aggressive marketing and fare structure for the service was one of the reasons for the decline of Emeraude Lines which eventually closed down. Condor 10 remained on the Saint-Malo-Channel Islands service until September 2010. On wintertime she was laid up in Weymouth, her place taken by one of the larger Condor fastcraft. In 2010, Condor 10 was replaced by the Condor Rapide.Condor buys larger boat for Jersey to France route BBC News 26 March 2010 This new ship is similar to the existing ships Condor owns. In September 2010, Condor 10 was brought back into service to cover the Weymouth/CI routes while Condor Vitesse underwent repairs to two of her four engines. Once the Condor Vitesse was repaired, Condor 10 was once again retired and remained in Weymouth Port. In September 2011, Condor 10 was sold, and taken by a joint condor and new owner team to Busan in South Korea on a 25-day journey, where she now operates on an internal ferry route under the name Hanil Blue Narae.

He was the First Mayor of his home city of Hamburg from 1988 to 1997, serving as President of the Bundesrat from 1990 to 1991. Education After receiving his high-school diploma, he studied law and economics at the University of Hamburg, where he graduated in 1969. Since 1974 he has been working as a notary in Hamburg, only during his terms as First Mayor of Hamburg (from 1988 until 1997) taking a break from his job. Political career In 1966 Henning Voscherau joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). His political career began in 1970 when he became a member of the district assembly in Wandsbek. Four years later, in 1974, he was elected as a member of the Hamburg Parliament (German: Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft). From 1981 to 1989 Voscherau was vice chairman of the Hamburg SPD, and in 1982 he also became chairman of the SPD parliamentary group in the Hamburg city assembly, a post from which he resigned in 1987 after having differences with the mayor Klaus von Dohnanyi over dealing with illegal squatters in Hamburg (in the Hamburg Hafenstrasse area). Voscherau became First Mayor of the Free and Hanseatic City Hamburg on 8 June 1988, and held this office until 8 October 1997. He resigned from the mayor's office since he intended to build a coalition with the local STATT party after winning the 1997 election, instead the Hamburg's SPD favoured a coalition with the Green Party. Although he stepped down from active politics in Hamburg that year, and started working as notary again, he remained vice president of the SPD until 2001. In late 2005/early 2006 Voscherau tried briefly to return to political life in Hamburg, when he announced he would run for Hamburg mayor again. This was met by stiff resistance in his own party, and in May 2006 at an SPD party convention in Hamburg he withdrew his bid for office. Personal life Henning Voscherau was married and had three children. His father was Carl Voscherau, a German stage and film actor, his brother Eggert is member of the board of directors of BASF.

The novel revolves around a plot to retrieve the buried treasure of nefarious pirate Red Ned Ockham. The treasure, which is estimated to be worth close to two billion dollars, reputedly includes \\"St. Michael's Sword\\", a weapon with the power to kill anyone who looks at it. The novel is pure fiction but is based in part on the legend of the Oak Island Money Pit. The location of the pit, described as the Water Pit in Riptide, is moved to a fictional Ragged Island, a dangerous drumlin island approximately six miles off the coast of Maine. Riptide is prominent among Preston and Child's works as being the one and only novel by both authors that is a complete stand-alone story, separate from their other works. No characters seen or mentioned in Riptide have any role in any of their other novels, unlike their other stand- alone works such as Mount Dragon, Thunderhead, and The Ice Limit.  Plot/Summary  The novel begins in 1971 and introduces main character Malin Hatch and his older brother Johnny Hatch. In search of something to do with their summer day, Malin suggests that the two explore Ragged Island, an island owned by the Hatch family. Ragged Island is strictly off limits to the boys, because of its ability to \\"destroy\\" those who come in contact with it. The Hatch brothers ignore their father's demand to stay away from the island and set off for it. Once the boys make it to the island, a terrible accident takes place, that Malin will struggle with for the next 25 years. Twenty five years later, Dr. Malin Hatch is approached by Gerard Neidelman, a self-proclaimed recovery specialist (a euphemism for treasure hunter), who claims to know who designed the pit, and, therefore, holds the key to unearthing the treasure. Hatch is at first skeptical of Neidelman's claim, but at length allows him to dig on the island. Once on the island, things do not go as planned. Mysterious accidents, illnesses and computer problems plague the salvage team, and it is discovered that the architect of the \\"Water Pit\\" is more clever than anyone realized. It also is revealed that the artifact, St. Michael's Sword, is in fact radioactive. This accounts for both the mysterious deaths of Red Ned's crew and for the computer glitches the team is having. The man who designed the water pit had realized that the artifact is actually deadly as well, so he built the pit to collapse on anyone entering it. However, the team learns too late that the entire island is sitting over a massive natural void in the ground, and that anyone removing the sword will collapse it. When Neidelman attempts to regain the sword, ignoring the warnings of the rest of the treasure-hunting team, he fatally irradiates both himself and another character before the island collapses beneath the sea and the sword is lost forever. Neidelman is also lost in the collapse. Reception Critical reception has been positive. Publishers Weekly wrote a mostly favorable review for Riptide, criticizing it for its \\"diffusion of villains\\" while also stating that \\"Machine-gun pacing, startling plot twists and smart use of legend, scientific lore (including cyptanalysis) and the evocative setting carry the day, however, resulting in an exciting boys' adventure tale for adults that's bound to be one of most popular of the summer reads.\\" IGN had a similar opinion, stating that it \\"was predictable to me in a few spots, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of it. After all, you know Indiana Jones is going to get the girl, win the prize, and he's not going to die, but it's still fun to get from point A to point B. That's the case here.\\" Film According to an interview in 2003 with Douglas Preston, talk of a film based upon the book was in its beginning stages. As of 2008, the film has still not started production. No further comment on the film has been announced since 2003.

A group of priests and educators, including Father Jimmy Tompkins, Father Moses Coady, Rev. Hugh MacPherson and A.B. MacDonald led this movement from a base at the Extension Department at St. Francis Xavier University (St. F.X.) in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. The credit union systems of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and PEI owe their origins to the Antigonish Movement, which also had an important influence on other provincial systems across Canada. The Coady International Institute at St. F.X. has been instrumental in developing credit unions and in asset-based community development initiatives in developing countries ever since. Goals As educators and priests, the leaders of the Antigonish Movement were primarily concerned with human and spiritual development. The title of Moses Coady's only book ‚Äì Masters of Their Own Destiny ‚Äì encapsulates this desire to see ordinary Nova Scotians achieve economic and social freedom. However, Coady argued that for practical reasons \\"we consider it good pedagogy and good psychology, to begin with the economic phase ... that we may more readily attain the spiritual and cultural towards which all our efforts are directed.\\"Moses Coady. Masters of Their Own Destiny: The Story of the Antigonish Movement of Adult Education Through Economic Cooperation. Harper & Brothers Publishers, New York, 1939, p. 112. Ordinary Nova Scotians he argued, had only themselves to blame for their poverty and vulnerability. They had permitted money and business to become mysterious forces outside of their control. Fishers and farmers for example, were exploited by marketing middlemen. Everyone was exploited by moneylenders. If they took the time to understand their circumstances and took the risks of co- operative action, they could achieve economic security and on that foundation greater freedom and self-realization. In a vision that has been renewed today in digital forms of mass collaboration, Coady argued that \\"the only hope of democracy is that enough noble, independent, energetic souls may be found who are prepared to work overtime, without pay\\" in order to shape a free and prosperous society.Moses Coady. Masters of Their Own Destiny, 1939, p. 18 Origins The origins of co-operatives in Nova Scotia go back to a cooperative store in Stellarton, founded in 1861. Co-operative creameries and fruit-growers co-ops were established by farmers to free them from exploitative middleman in the 1890s. Many early co-ops failed due to \\"poor management, domination by a few individuals and a lack of ongoing education.\\"Jim Lotz. The Humble Giant: Moses Coady, Canada's Rural Revolutionary. Novalis, Ottawa, 2005, pp. 37‚Äì8. However, the British Canadian Co-operative Society, a co-op store in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia, set an example of sound co-operation. By 1917 it has 1,220 members and over $500,000 in sales. That year, it organized a conference on co-ops. The conference, which featured Ontario co-operative pioneer George Keen as keynote speaker, renewed local energy and enthusiasm for the idea.Ian MacPherson. Building and Protecting the Co-operative Movement: A Brief History of the Co-operative Union of Canada, 1909-84. Co-operative Union of Canada, Ottawa, 1984, pp. 46‚Äì7. Adult education was the spirit of the movement, and Coady credits Dr. Hugh MacPherson and Rev. Jimmy Tompkins at St. F.X. with their early roles as \\"pioneer extension workers at the University interested in both adult education and economic cooperation.\\"Moses Coady. Masters of Their Own Destiny, p. 6. Jimmy Tompkins Father Jimmy Tompkins played a key role in concocting the \\"intellectual dynamite\\" that was later set off in almost every village in the Maritimes. Tompkins began teaching at St. F.X. in 1902. As vice-president of the university, he attended the Conference of British Empire Universities in London, England in 1912, and returned filled with ideas for ways that the university could become more involved in solving rural economic problems through adult education. British Workers Educational Associations, the Danish Folk High Schools, and Swedish Study Circles particularly interested him. And in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's agricultural program, and Quebec's agricultural colleges and credit unions, caught his attention.Anne Alexander. The Antigonish Movement: Moses Coady and Adult Education Today. Thompson Educational Publishing, Toronto, 1997; pp. 65-66. Tompkins had trouble making his case with the university's administration, and in 1922, St. F.X. sent Tompkins into \\"exile\\" as village priest in Canso, Nova Scotia. This did not slow the determined priest down, however. His approach to adult education in Canso triggered local action and a series of articles in The Halifax Chronicle which helped trigger a federal commission into the problems of the Maritime fisheries.Michael Welton, A new and disturbing presence: Father Moses Michael Coady and the United Maritime Fishermen. In Canadian Co-operatives in the Year 2000, Centre for the Study of Co-operatives, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, 2000, p. 101. Beginning in 1924 Tompkins organized the first of a series of annual conferences bringing together farmers, educators, students, priests and rural development experts. In 1928, seeking a more permanent organization, some of the leaders in this group launched a campaign that raised $100,000. This initiative, combined with the report of federal commission on the fisheries in 1928, prompted St. F.X. to support the formation of an Extension Department in 1928. Moses Coady Moses Coady is generally credited with transforming the vision of his cousin Tompkins into an effective program capable of spreading across the Maritimes. The defining moment in Coady's career came when he testified before a Canadian government commission in 1927. Drawing on his own experience and that of other movement leaders he maintained that the local economy could be revitalized if the right type of learning was cultivated in ordinary people: especially critical thinking, scientific methods of planning and production, and co-operative entrepreneurship.Welton, p. 97. The report of the MacLean Commission was catalytic: in late 1928 St. F.X. organized an Extension Department to carry adult education to the people of the province, appointing Coady as its first director. The Canadian Department of Fisheries asked Coady to help the government \\"organize the fishermen\\". Coady also invested considerable energy in catalyzing and strengthening wholesale co-operatives around the Maritimes: including the United Maritime Fishermen, the United Fruit Companies and the Canadian Livestock Co-operatives (Maritimes). Adult education in action The Antigonish program of adult education employed three main components: * the mass meeting, * the study club, and * the school for leaders.Stefanson, Brenda Gail. Adult educators in co-operative development: agents of change. Centre for the Study of Co-operatives, University of Saskatchewan, p. 21-23 =Mass meetings= The field staff of the Extension Department worked with local people to organize meetings in schools, churches, and community centres. People who heard Coady speak at these meetings described his speeches as \\"fiery\\" and \\"energizing\\". Coady challenged his audience not to accept their poverty but to take action to understand their situation, and then to think and to plan to change it. As he said many times, \\"You can get the good life. You're poor enough to want it and smart enough to get it.\\" He would propose that they set up study clubs and that those who could read help those who could not. =Study clubs= Study clubs typically met in members' homes, with the goal of understanding the factors keeping the members poor, to identify solutions, make plans, and take action. The Extension Department provided pamphlets and technical material on matters like agricultural methods, business organization, economics, and co-operative principles. The clubs studied local newspaper articles and any other materials that could help them understand their situation better. The leaders and ideas emerging from this process often carried it into the next stage ‚Äì organizing co-operatives and taking other initiatives to solve local problems. The Extension Department linked the study clubs together through a network called the Associated Study Clubs, which facilitated information sharing and capitalized on the building momentum. =School for leaders= Once the first co-operatives began, the Extension Department organized a six-week program at the university with courses in co-operative business, book-keeping, mathematics, economics, public speaking, and citizenship. The program was taught by successful co-operative leaders from around the province. The goal was to reduce the risks of business failure, and to invigorate the momentum in each community with fresh ideas. The program was taken to the villages by Coady and A.B. MacDonald. Roy Bergengren, director of Credit Union National of America, dedicated his book, Credit Union North America to A.B. MacDonald, who he describes as \\"an extraordinary organizer and an inspired leader who is known in every city, town and fishing hamlet throughout the length and breadth of the province\\". MacDonald went on to direct the Nova Scotia Credit Union League and then the Co-operative Union of Canada.Roy F. Bergengren, Credit Union North America. Southern Publishers Inc., New York, 1940, pp. 248 Co-operative development Coady's biographer Jim Lotz gives an example of how the link between the Antigonish approach, community development and co-operatives worked in the village of Judique, Nova Scotia. By 1932 the Extension Department had sparked the formation of 179 study clubs with 1,500 members in Nova Scotia. Over the next six years, during the height of Coady and MacDonald's work in the villages, the number of study clubs rose to 1,110 with 10,000 participants. By 1938 these study clubs had formed 142 credit unions, 39 co-operative stores, 17 co-operative lobster factories, 11 co-operative fish plants, and 11 other co-ops.Anne M. Alexander. The Antigonish Movement, 1997, p. 88 \\"Perhaps the most important reason why the Antigonish movement was able to have a significant, lasting impact was its promotion of credit unions.\\" MacPherson, 1979, p. 132. The farmers, fishers, and miners who formed the backbone of the movement had little access to credit before the Great Depression, and lost what little they had as the downturn started to bite. With the help of Roy Bergengren and the American credit union movement, Nova Scotia passed the first sound credit union legislation in English Canada in 1932. From Nova Scotia to the world The conference of the cooperative movement in Ch√©ticamp, Nova Scotia (Canada) From its start in 1928, the Extension Department at St. Francis Xavier University was concerned with spreading its message well beyond Nova Scotia. It was particularly concerned about the other provinces in the Maritimes. For example, by 1936 there were 200 study clubs operating in New Brunswick, and the legislature passed a credit union law that year. Wilfred Keohan, the New Brunswick Registrar of Credit Unions, wrote in 1939 that \\"There can be no doubt but that the experience in Nova Scotia had a marked influence as credit union enthusiasm knows no frontiers. The crystallized demand came from such bodies as the New Brunswick Council of Labour, the Trades & Labour Council, the Farmer's and Dairyman's Association, fishermen's organizations and members of the clergy who saw in credit unions an economic regeneration of their flocks.\\" By 1939 ten thousand members were participating in 95 credit unions (including caisses populaires) in the province.Roy F. Bergengren, p. 250-51 By 1936 Coady and MacDonald were increasingly traveling beyond the Maritimes to Ontario, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, where their speeches and ideas helped ignite local credit union movements. After Nova Scotia passed a credit union law in 1932, New Brunswick and PEI were the next to pass legislation (1936). By 1939 every province in Canada had a credit union movement and a legal framework to guide it. Bergengren wrote in 1940 that \\"out of the Nova Scotia experience has come a new and most valuable study club technique that will have a far reaching effect on the whole future of the credit union movement.\\" He credited the rapid expansion of credit unions to other provinces across Canada to the Antigonish movement.Bergengren, p. 262 The Board of Governors of St. Francis Xavier University established The Coady International Institute to honour Moses Coady less than six months after his death. The institute has played a role in the emergence of credit unions throughout the world, especially in Africa. Since then, over 7,000 community development practitioners from over 120 countries have studied at the campus in Antigonish. Criticisms By the end of World War II the credit unions and co-operatives of the Maritimes were an acknowledged success, gaining international recognition. The study clubs for which the movement was noted declined however, and attention had shifted from human emancipation towards building stronger, more professional institutions. \\"Most of the educational attainment in the war and its aftermath focused on training elite managers for the co-operative institutions. Evidence from the co-operative reports of the 1940s indicates clearly that the common people were not participating very much in the life of their institutions.\\"Michael Welton. Beyond Coady: adult education and the end of utopian modernism. Proceedings of the AERC, 2000. Like many of the integrated rural development programs in the developing world today, the Antigonish Movement encountered a grass-roots challenge to its vision in the implementation stage. In the end, the grand vision of fishers and miners appreciating Shakespeare and grand opera seemed to usually lead to one community project: co-operative microfinance through credit unions. Ian MacPherson, a co-operative historian and theorist, argues that most co- operative movements are dependent for their early impetus on the support of networks of external players like church groups, government departments or wealthy patrons. As the movement begins to transform into a credit union system, \\"...necessary managerial and technical changes may be inhibited by the \\"founders\\": revered individuals who have made great contributions but who, as they age and the institution they helped found develops, may hold back necessary change and new generations of leadership.\\" Ian MacPherson. Hands Around the Globe: A History of the International Credit Union Movement and the Role and Development of World Council of Credit Unions, Inc. Horsdal & Schubart Publishers & WOCCU, Victoria, Canada 1999, p. xv. Nova Scotia's credit union system, springing from the centre of the Antigonish Movement, today has a far lower penetration of members (18%) than the systems in neighbouring New Brunswick (41%) and Prince Edward Island (45%).Brett Matthews. Compounding community capital: Canada's credit unions and the untapped assets of poor communities. Canadian Co-operative Association, 2006, p. 5. Coady acknowledged that the credit unions were promoting thrift and household budgeting, and showing members by example how much money they could bring to bear on their communities' problems through co-operative action. But to him, the main purpose of credit unions was moral. The credit union \\"makes people honest\\". \\"There have been a few instances of dishonest managers and some slow borrowers, but the credit union organization takes care of these cases.\\"Moses Coady. Masters of Their Own Destiny. p. 83. In other parts of Canada, most notably Quebec, Saskatchewan and Manitoba where some of the strongest credit union systems emerged, the movement's early leaders recognized the need to address the practical problems that emerged from the demand for credit unions. Innovations like the Saskatchewan Mutual Aid Board ‚Äì the first private sector deposit insurance scheme in Canada ‚Äì focused on protecting the savings of members. These practical innovations, grounded in addressing the practical needs of members, led to stronger and more sustained institutional growth. Legacy The study club successfully addressed one of the enduring challenges of co-operative development. Co-operative enterprises address the principal‚Äìagent problem by making all users of an enterprise into owners. When users accept the duties of owners, this structure results in strong governance and control systems. However, the assets in co-operative enterprises are vulnerable when the users aren't prepared to accept the duties of ownership. In a paper for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1962, Alexander Laidlaw, a co-operative leader who served as a director at the Extension Department, wrote that: Antigonish-style study clubs, unlike traditional seminars or workshops, require all members to collectively manage a group process even before they launch a co-operative. Members can take a hard look at each other's capabilities and weigh their collective prospects with a clear head while they learn the skills they need to launch community ventures. By the end of World War II a series of leaders from Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen to Edward Filene to Alphonse Desjardins to Moses Coady had shown that cooperative movements could reach and empower poor populations in a way that deepened the economic gains of capitalism while alleviating some of its undesirable social effects. This prepared the way for a wave of 'anti-communist' co-operative development led by the US government in the developing world in the 1940-1960s. For precisely the reasons just noted, however, the results of this 'state-led' credit union development were mixed at best. The philosophy and techniques of Antigonish anticipated some of the key ideas of rural development, including the emancipatory pedagogy of Paulo Freire, and the philosophy of Robert Chambers/participatory rural assessment. However, the Antigonish approach runs into significant problems in oral communities and those with anti-democratic traditions. This has limited the replicability of the movement, and led to significant offshoots, such as the self-help group movement in India, village banking and the ASCA movement in parts of Africa. In our current times, Coady International Institute has continued to promote and support people owned institutions around the world through its leadership programs. The idea of 'collectives' managing their finances or enterprises have taken many new shapes in modern times. Self-Help Groups (SHGs) - small group of 10-20 members, mostly women, have become very popular and wide spread particularly in India but also elsewhere with an estimated 110 million members; while another similar small group managed system called Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLAs) have become popular particularly across the continent of Africa with over 10 million members. These small groups managed and governed financial services are similar in idea to the Study Clubs of Antigonish movement, and avoid the possible negative outcomes of Credit Unions becoming more corporate and moving away from members' active participation and control. These small group models are particularly popular among women, perhaps as they face barriers in joining even the local cooperatives with men as dominant members. These informal groups have become immensely popular, often coming together to form 'federations' for greater collective bargaining power and reaching economies of scale, essentially becoming and behaving like formal cooperative. Non- financial cooperatives - such as fishermen coop or farmers coops of the Antigonish movement, continue to provide an alternative economic model the world over despite rise of private sector led economic growth, especially for small producers and farmers in accessing markets and negotiating prices collectively. Within Maritimes though, such cooperatives seem to have given way to more individual enterprises that operate more as 'association' rather than collective business, but continuing to have a very close sense of 'community' and collective identity - be it lobster fishers or dairy farmers. Newer form of economic enterprises of recent times are also generally termed as 'social enterprises' - with dual objective of profit and socially responsible and positive outcomes. Such enterprises don't always have collective ownership, but almost always have a sense of 'community' well- being. Investment Cooperatives are yet another form of collective enterprise, often getting formed to finance a community based enterprise such as alternative energy coop or local-food marketing coop. Shared-economy is yet another form of new wave idea that borrows from same coop principle of community sharing an economy more inclusively; though the potential conflict between the private and corporate profit v/s community benefiting collectively continues to be an ongoing debate; a debate that Antigonish Movement challenged in 1920 and 1930s, and seem to go through in cyclical fashion ever- since. Societies are once again at cross-roads for balancing between individual and corporate wealth, group / cooperative enterprises, and more shared-economies where everyone can share benefits. Legacy and lessons from the Antigonish Movement continue to be relevant in our modern times.

It was of significant importance for the nation's security, as it housed the air force's sole air reconnaissance unit. The early years On the 30 March 1951 a \\"Top Secret Order of Distinct Importance\\", issued by the Chief of the People's Armed Forces established the 26th Independent Air Reconnaissance Regiment, concentrating the three squadrons of Petlyakov Pe-2s at Graf Ignatievo Air Base airfield. In the period between May and September the same year the unit was redistributed to Krumovo airfield and subsequently from 2 Oct 1951 to the 23 September 1955 to Gorna Oryakhovitsa airfield. In September 1955 the regiment transferred for the last time to a new location, this one being the newly constructed airfield at Tolbukhin (as the city of Dobrich was called at that time). The 26th IRAR converted to the aircraft, previously flown by the 30th Bomber Air Division, based at Balchik airfield, namely about 20 Tupolev Tu-2T torpedo bombers. In addition brand new Ilyushin Il-28 (between 10 and 12) jet bombers were delivered to be used in the reconnaissance role. As the flight hours of the latter depleted in 1959 they were withdrawn from service. In order to keep the operational skills of the flight crews 3 Ilyushin Il-14 transport planes were transferred to the regiment for training purposes. The reason for that was the delivery of a second batch of Il-28s in 1961, this one of dedicated reconnaissance planes of the R-variant. In the same year the Tu-2Ts were also withdrawn from use as the first of the MiG-15bisR entered operations. They were supplemented two years later by the MiG-17 and with their arrival a group of Algerian pilots was trained to that type of aircraft. In 1969 six MiG-21R entered service, along with some MiG-21F-13, being previously flown by the 2nd Squadron of the 19th Fighter Air Regiment (from Graf Ignatievo airfield). In 1972 more MiG-21F-13 came from the 1st Squadron of the 15th FAR (Ravnets airfield) were introduced as that unit converted to a more advanced variant of the MiG-21. The MiG-21R/ F-13 were concentrated in the 1st Squadron of the 26th IRAR, the 2nd Squadron operated the MiG-15bisR and MiG-17 and the 3rd Squadron - about 6 Il-28R. In 1974 the Ilyushins left the inventory and the MiG-15bisR - in 1981. A Major Leap In 1981 the advanced MiG-25RBT entered service with the Bulgarian Air Force to form the Operational Reconnaissance Flight for photographic reconnaissance and ELINT duties, and a secondary task of ground attack. For it up to 8 500 kg unguided bombs could be carried. But the most impressive ability was to carry nuclear bombs and upon the beginning of a major military conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact they were to be delivered from the Soviet Union for nuclear strikes against Greece and Turkey. A MiG-25RBT was lost in flight due to bad meteorological conditions and consequent lack of fuel in 1984. The remaining two units along with the sole dual-seater were transferred to the Soviet Union in 1991 in exchange for 5 MiG-23MLD transferred to the 1st Squadron of the 18th FAR in Dobroslavtsi Air Base. In 1984 the regiment's 2nd Squadron converted to the Su-22M-4/UM-3K (the last units being delivered in 1988) for use as a tactical reconnaissance platform in photo reconnaissance and ELINT tasks. The last MiG-17 left the air force's inventory in 1989, At that time the 2/26th RAR was an elite air unit of the Warsaw Pact, comprising 22 pilots-1st class being superbly trained in airborne reconnaissance, guided weapons ground attack and even Air-to-Air combat, utilising the R-60 AAM, with about 120-130 flight hours yearly. Until the Treaty for Conventional Forces in Europe forced the Bulgarian Air Force to remove that kind of specialised equipment nuclear strikes could also have been carried. The Final Years The MiG-21F-13 were withdrawn from duty in exchange for some MiG-21MF from the disbanded 21st FAR Uzundzhovo Air Base (Uzundzhovo airfield), which the technical crews converted for re-con duties in a truly remarkable way. They used the UB-16 multiple launch rocket pods as a base for a new re-con pod with the addition of two AFA-39 airborne photographic cameras, that system being carried under the left side of the fuselage. In 1994 the 26th RAR became the 26th Reconnaissance Air Base with 1/26.RAB flying Su-22M-4/UM-3K and 2/26.RAB flying MiG-21MF/R/UM. A year later some L-39ZA were acquired in order to preserve the flight abilities of the pilots. The last remaining MiG-21R were withdrawn from service and because of that some more MiG-21MF were optimised to carry their dedicated re-con pods and so were denominated to MiG-21MF-R. In 1998 the 6th Fighter Air Base at Balchik airfield was disbanded and its aircraft and personnel formed the 3rd Squadron of the 26th RAB only for Dobrich Air Base also to be disbanded in 2002.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of R√ºdesheim, whose seat is in the municipality of R√ºdesheim an der Nahe. Geography =Location= Dalberg lies in the Gr√§fenbach valley in the Hunsr√ºck and has a population of about 250, who are mainly Catholic, and who live mainly along the Gr√§fenbach and the Mehlbach, two of the village's three streets.Location =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Dalberg's neighbours are the municipalities of Wallhausen, Argenschwang and Spabr√ºcken. History The village of Dalberg arose in the Gr√§fenbach valley at the like-named castle at a rather arbitrarily chosen spot that was rather ill-suited for agriculture. Part of the village's history is inextricably bound with the Lords of Dalberg. Castle Dalberg was built sometime about 1150 to 1170.History Because of the noble family's association with the village and the castle, the name \\"Dalberg\\" is well known in German history. The family Dalberg has brought forth many important politicians, scientists and bishops. Their name is drawn from the castle, which is also known as the Dalburg (Berg and Burg, both common placename endings in Germany ‚Äì as well as standalone words in German ‚Äì have different pronunciations and meanings: the former is [b…õ Åk], meaning \\"mountain\\", and the latter [b ä Åk], meaning \\"castle\\"). Even now that it is a ruin, this once mighty building still bears witness to its former owners‚Äô might and influence. It was at the foot of the castle that the village of Dalberg sprang up.History Religion Besides the castle and the old village bakehouse, the chapel is among the village's most historically important buildings. The bells there are still rung by hand. Dalbergers are mostly Catholic and have kept the traditions of the liturgical year.Religion As at 31 August 2013, there are 257 full-time residents in Dalberg, and of those, 49 are Evangelical (19.066%), 171 are Catholic (66.537%), 3 (1.167%) belong to other religious groups and 34 (13.23%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Dalberg's mayor is Karl Heinz Leister.Dalberg‚Äôs mayor =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Azure a fess Or between three fleurs-de-lis of the same and charged with a cross moline sable.

By 1485, the village below the castle had grown so greatly that it seemed quite fitting for it to have its own chapel. Shortly before this time, on 24 April 1483, the church at Spabr√ºcken, given what a long way it was to Wallhausen, was granted leave by the Church to put up a baptismal font, thus making a decisive stride towards a kind of parochial autonomy. It might also have strengthened the Dalberg dwellers‚Äô wish to have their own church. The master builders in charge of the project might well have been Philipp I (1428-1492) and Friedrich (1459-1506) of Dalberg, who also appear in historical records as the caretakers of the churches in Spabr√ºcken and Wallhausen. The noble pastor of Wallhausen was Friedrich's brother Johann (1455-1503), who as of 1482 was also the Prince-Bishop of Worms. Generally held to be the one who actually built the chapel in the dale is Prince-Bishop Johann. His coat of arms graces a console inside the chapel. The year 1485 in an inscription over the chapel's east window may confirm the building date. Dating from the same time are the wall paintings, among them one of Saint Leonard himself, surrounded by prisoners (of whom he is patron saint). In this region, it was rather unusual for a church or chapel to be consecrated to this saint. What decided this might well have been a certain fashion, but rather likelier was a longstanding reverence that the family of chamberlains, for Gerhard, Chamberlain of Worms, and his wife Margarete, the last of the Dalberg line from the family von Sch√∂neberg, had endowed a Saint Leonard's Altar at Saint Martin's Church at Worms as early as 1331. It is likely that the Lords of Dalberg forthwith put the two chapels together, the one at the castle (Saint Anthony's) and the one in the dale (Saint Leonard's), putting them both in one altarist's care. Dalberg's first clergyman, as far as is known, was a man named Nikolaus Vickis, who from 1500 to 1506 was likewise the altarist of Saint Valentine‚Äôs Altar at the hospital in Oppenheim. It is believed that he also took on clerical duties for the village in the dale (Dalberg). It could be that the remuneration for this post was low, for even the Michael Schmitt from Wallhausen that Wolff von Dalberg appointed in 1538 had already been working since 1536 as the altarist of Saint Margaret's Altar at Spabr√ºcken.Saint Leonard‚Äôs Chapel Economy and infrastructure There are hardly any earning opportunities in Dalberg, only a few small businesses and the village's last winemaker.

Studios and offices were in the Liberty National Bank Building. After the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) took effect in 1941, the station moved to AM 1340. WSAV was an NBC Red Network affiliate, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio. In 1947, an FM station was added, 100.3 WSAV-FM. It mostly simulcast the AM station's programming, but management did not see much of a future for FM radio and was more interested in building a TV station. Because of this, WSAV-FM stopped broadcasting in the mid-1950s and the license was turned in. =Move to AM 630= In 1949, WSAV moved to AM 630, coupled with a big boost in power. WSAV began running at 5,000 watts around the clock, non-directional by day but using a directional antenna at night to protect other stations on the frequency.Broadcasting Yearbook 1954 page 120 WSAV used a three-tower antenna array on Oatland Island. In 1956, WSAV put Savannah's second TV station on the air. WSAV had battled with rival radio station 900 WJIV for the last VHF TV license available in Savannah. (Channel 11 WTOC-TV had gone on the air two years earlier.) WSAV emerged the winner. Channel 3 WSAV-TV became an NBC-TV affiliate, since WSAV was an NBC Radio affiliate. =Sale to Beasley= In 1977, management decided to sell the radio station, while retaining the TV station. AM 630 WSAV was sold to Beasley Broadcasting.Broadcasting Yearbook 1979 page C-57 Because two stations that were no longer co-owned could not share the same call letters, AM 630 became WKBX. Beasley teamed up the station with FM station 95.5 WSGF, which it also owned. (WSGF is now active rock WIXV.) WKBX's full service middle of the road format was continued for several years. But in 1981, the station switched to a Christian radio format. In 1983, WKBX began airing country music. It changed to WBMQ in 1985 and began playing oldies. WBMQ and WSGF were bought by Radio Southeast in 1988.Broadcasting Yearbook 1991 page B-87 Radio Southeast changed WBMQ's format to talk in 1990. The station featured local hosts and at night carried syndicated shows from NBC Talknet. World and national news was supplied by CBS Radio News. =Sale to Cumulus= In 1998, Cumulus Media bought WBMQ and its FM sister station, WIXV. Cumulus also acquired 93.1 WEAS-FM, 96.5 WJCL-FM, 900 WJLG and 102.1 WZAT, creating a six-station cluster. All of the stations were moved to studios on Television Circle in Savannah. In the early 2010s, WBMQ gave up its transmitter site on Oatland Island, and moved to a new location in Savannah, near the Savannah River. Because it was now using a single non-directional tower, it had to reduce its output. Daytime power dropped slightly to 4,800 watts, and nighttime power was reduced significantly to 47 watts. While the daytime signal covered a large region of Coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the nighttime signal only served Savannah and its adjacent communities.Radio- Locator.com/WBMQ WBMQ's transmitter was damaged by a lightning storm in July 2020, taking the station silent; WJLG, which operated from the same site, would remain on the air at reduced power. That October, Cumulus elected to return both stations' licenses to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) instead of making repairs; the surrender also invalidated a construction permit for an FM translator station, W245DD (96.9), to relay WBMQ.

Despite its advanced design and exceptionally good performance, it never achieved certification or entered production.  Development  The aircraft was the result of Giuseppe Bellanca's son, August. Bellanca formed Bellanca Aircraft Engineering Inc. company in Scott Depot, West Virginia to develop a new design conceived in 1957. The Skyrocket II was a six-seat, low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional configuration with retractable tricycle undercarriage. It was constructed of composite materials, an advanced feature for its time, and test flying proved it to be extremely fast in the air. Within months of its first flight, the prototype claimed five world airspeed records for an aircraft in its class, with all but one still standing . The aircraft attracted the attention of NASA, which conducted an aerodynamic analysis of the design, in order to investigate natural laminar flow as a factor of its high performance. Plans to produce the aircraft commercially were scrapped due to the downturn in the civil aviation market in the United States in the early 1980s. In the mid-1990s, the design was developed into a kit and sold as the Skyrocket III to help fund a new certification programme. The Skyrocket III features greater speed, payload and range and was re-engineered for modular construction. By 1998 eleven kits had been delivered, but it is uncertain if any were completed and flown.Purdy, Don: AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition, page 120.

It is primarily a residential area which developed as a result of expansion from the town during the 19th century.  Location  North Watford is situated between Watford town centre and Garston. The area of North Watford is not officially defined, but is generally understood as the area north of Watford Junction railway station. North Watford roughly corresponds to the boundaries of three electoral wards in Watford, Leggatts, Callowland and Tudor Wards. Together, they form a triangular area bounded to the south west by the West Coast Main Line, to the north by the A41 road (North Western Avenue) and to the south east by the River Colne, with the southern edge running along Colne Way and across the industrial areas north of Watford Junction station. History Robin Day's Polyprop Chair, designed in Watford The earliest record for the town of Watford documents a charter granted by King Henry I to hold a market in Watford. Until the 19th century, Watford was a small town and the area to the north Watford was little more than farmland and manorial estates, owned by the Earls of Essex and the Earls of Clarendon. Census documents from the 1880s show that much of the farmland belonged to Callowland Farm and Bushey Hall Farm. In 1833 the London and Birmingham Railway began to construct its new long-distance railway line through Watford which opened in 1838 between and . The advent of the railway improved links to London and other cities and made Watford attractive to industry; as a result, the need for more housing increased and the land usage in North Watford was given over to house building. In 1881 Callowland was purchased by the Earl of Essex from the Master and Fellows of Merton College, Oxford, and housing development began in the 1890s. The area was given the name of Watford New Town and later took the name of Callowland, but in 1916 the area was renamed North Watford. Today, North Watford is mostly residential and is mainly characterised by red brick terraced houses of the late 19th century. Among the industries setting up in the area was Wells Watford Brewery Ltd. Founded in 1890 by Lincolnshire farmer Ralph Thorpe, the brewery built up a large operation on St Albans Road with its premises linked to the St Albans branch line via a short railway line for transporting beer into London. The company was taken over in 1951 by another Watford brewery, Benskins Brewery and eventually wound up in 1955. Thorpe was a prominent local figure who was one of the founders of Watford Football Club and served as mayor of the town 1923-25. A large chocolate factory of Dr. Tibbles' Vi-Cocoa Company opened in North Watford in 1899. The company produced a range of cocoa products, including Dr. Tibbles' Vi-Cocoa, Dr. Tibbles' Coca tablets, Dr. Tibbles' Brain Feeder and Dr. Tibbles' Child‚Äôs Restorer. The company's advertising claimed that these products offered numerous health benefits and revitalising effects; as well as extracts of cocoa and kola, some also reputedly contained an amount of cocaine in their ingredients. In February 1903, a fire broke out at Dr. Tibbles' factory, consuming the building in the largest fire that had ever occurred in Watford. The factory was closed and rebuilt. Trading as The Watford Manufacturing Company, the company produced supplies for frontline troops in World War I, but after expanding the premises after the war, the company went bankrupt in 1922. In 1951, the British furniture manufacturer Hille moved from its premises in Hainault to the former Wells Brewery building. The company, founded in 1906 in the East End of London by a Russian immigrant, Salamon Hille, specialised in modern design furniture, most notably the polypropylene stacking chair designed by Robin Day while he worked at Hille in Watford. The Polyprop went on to become the world's best-selling chair. The company's success grew and in 1961 it opened a new showroom and office building on the St Albans Road, Hille House.  Landmarks  Odhams Printworks Christ Church, St Alban's Road Watford railway station Ern≈ë Goldfinger's Hille House on St Albans Road (1959) The most prominent landmark building in North Watford is the former printworks of Odhams Press, a large brick and concrete structure which was built in 1954 to the designs of Yates, Cook & Darbyshire architects and modelled on the design of Stockholm City Hall. This building was an extension to an older printworks which had been built in 1937 by Sir Owen Williams. This locally listed building stands on the A41 North Western Avenue with its prominent clock tower overlooking the Dome Roundabout and it is still in use today as a print works. Its prominent clock tower houses a tank for holding water used during the printing process. Another locally listed building in North Watford is Christ Church, an Anglican church on St Albans Road. This distinctive red brick structure was designed in a semi-Italian Romanesque style by the architects John Hudson and John Hunt and is noted for its semicircular brick apse. The foundation stone for the Church was laid in 1904 by Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, fifth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.Locally Listed Buildings, p.38 Opposite this church, at 124-132 St Albans Road, stands Hille House, the former offices of the furniture design firm Hille. This 1959 concrete office block has been locally listed as it is the work of the noted architect Ern≈ë Goldfinger and an example of Brutalist architecture.Locally Listed Buildings, p.30 The front of the building features a cantilevered concrete box glazed with brightly coloured glass, a signature of Goldfinger's design and the first of his buildings to have this feature. Behind this stands the former Wells Brewery (1890‚Äì1901). This was the premises of Wells Watford Brewery Ltd, a local beer brewing company. The brewery was taken over by Benskins Brewery in 1951 and closed in 1955.Locally Listed Buildings, p.31 North Watford's connection with railway history can be seen in the Grade-II-listed Old Station House at 147A St Albans Road. This small, single-storey red-brick building was built 1836-7 as the original Watford Station when the first section of the London- Birmingham railway was opened, a rare surviving example of architecture from the beginning of the railway age. In the short period when the Dowager Queen Adelaide was resident at Cassiobury House (c. 1846-49), this station was remodelled to provide her with a royal waiting room. It was also reportedly used by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on a trip to visit Sir Robert Peel in November 1843, when they travelled by road from Windsor Castle to take a train from Watford to . It closed in 1858 when it was replaced by the new station at Watford Junction and today the building is occupied by a second-hand car dealership. The railway tunnel built under North Watford in 1837 is also a significant example of railway architecture, and the neoclassical stone entrance to the original western tunnel of the London & Birmingham Railway has been awarded Grade II listingNationally Listed Buildings in Watford, p.9  Transport  = Railway stations = Watford North entrance North Watford is served by Watford North railway station, a small halt on the suburban St Albans Branch Line between and Watford. The station was originally opened in 1910 as Callowland station, and was renamed Watford North in 1927. West Midlands Trains operates a local train service on this route today, operating as London Northwestern Railway. The North Watford area is also served at its southern end by Watford Junction railway station, which provides local and InterCity rail links on the West Coast Main Line including a frequent service into London Euston. Mainline train services are operated by Avanti West Coast and West Midlands Trains. The station is also served by London Overground services on the Watford DC Line and Southern services on the cross-London route to and . London Underground Metropolitan line services are due to commence operation out of Watford Junction in 2018/9. It has also been proposed that the Crossrail line could be extended via Watford Junction in future. = Bus routes = The main bus routes which serve Watford and the surrounding area all pass down St Albans Road to get to the town centre from Garston bus garage. This means the area has very good bus links, including those from other towns such as St Albans by the 724, 321, 621, 622 and 320. There are also local bus routes 1, 8, 10 and bus W19 which serves the local housing estate. There is also the R8, 319 and R16 buses which serve Asda and Sainsbury's superstore. All this will change in 2018 when Garston bus garage closes down to make way for development. = Road = Watford's links to the motorway network run through North Watford. The main thoroughfare through North Watford is the St Albans Road (A412) which runs northwards through the area from Watford town centre. At its northern end it joins the Dome Roundabout which links Watford to the A41 towards Hemel Hempstead, the North Orbital Road (A405) towards St Albans, and to the M1 and M25 motorways. National Cycle Route 6 runs along the eastern boundary of North Watford, partly along the banks of the River Colne. This long-distance cycle path provides connections to Watford town centre, Rickmansworth, St Albans and beyond.  Shops  St Albans Road and its environs house a wide variety of retail and leisure outlets. These include: newsagents, public houses, restaurants and a post office.

It is commonly found along the coastal plain in dry sandy soils, especially in pinelands. While it is not considered to be in high danger of extinction, it is of conservation concern and has most likely been extirpated from much of its original range. The slender aster was for a long time considered to be a variety of E. surculosa, but Guy Nesom's recent research within the genus has shown that it is distinct enough to be treated as a species. It has also been shown to be related to E. avita and E. paludosa. Eurybia compacta is a perennial up to 70 cm (28 inches) tall, the stem becoming woody with age. The flowers emerge from midsummer to the beginning of fall, with as many as 55 flower heads in a flat-topped array. Each head contains 5-14 pale blue, light violet or reddish purple ray florets surrounding 10-20 pale yellow disc florets.

Purpose Statement According to their website, the stated purposes of the ACQTC are: # To preserve, protect, enhance, and propagate our Native American, Algonquian-speaking cultural heritage; # To revive, restore, and revitalize the language and culture in particular of the Quinnipiac people (originally of SW Connecticut) and our kindred; # To protect and restore Mother Earth, Father Sky and all our relations to their natural balance and to foster respect and harmony in this quest; # To teach and share the values, history, culture, language, arts & crafts, of the Quinnipiac and kindred Algonquian peoples, whose traditions were considered lost until the ACQTC was formed; # To research and keep current with indigenous affairs and to promote both unity and harmony in the Native American communities, on and off the reservations; # To share our personal pride, ancestral knowledge, and wisdom; # To lecture, perform, and teach or otherwise present our culture, values, and ceremonies as an Algonquian ethos and map for living in balance in our world. Membership According to their website, the ACQTC has three forms of membership: full, confederate, and honorary. Full membership includes those whose lineages trace back to the family names of Manweeyeuh, Mahwee, Cockenoe, Nonsuch, Soebuck, Redhead, Sock, Brown, Adams, Griswold, Parmalee, Curley, Skeesucks, LaFrance, Quinney, Ninham, Dean, Thompson/Tompson, Peters, Montour, Marchand, Klingerschmidt, Moses, Cornelius, Higheum, Waubeno, Douglas, Scott, Anthony, Butler, Burnham, Rouleau, and Hazel. ACQTC reports there are 50 to 100 families in this category. Confederate membership includes refugee families who trace their ancestry to the refugiums and enclaves cited above at NY, MA, PA, RI, IN, OH, WI, KS, TX, and Quebec (Canada). ACQTC reports there are about 100 families in this category. Honorary membership are adoptees who \\"enter into the sacred BOND OF THE COVENANT with the ACQTC Central Council Fire and ACQTC Grand Council Fire Confederacy to honor, protect, and revitalize our language, religion, and traditions, and to honor our traditional obligations as Gechanniwitank (aboriginal land-stewards), under our 'aboriginal title to land' rights, where Quinnipiac ancestors worshipped the creator and creation at certain landmarks within our ancestral sachemdom.\\" ACQTC reports there are 25 to 50 families in this category. Organizational structure The ACQTC is an alliance of two separate tribal councils.

The Battle of Rosillo Creek (called the Battle of Salado Creek at the time) started as a siege of Presidio La Bah√≠a from November 7, 1812, to February 19, 1813, for the purpose of trying to recapture the fort after the Republican Army of the North under Bernardo Guti√©rrez de Lara and Samuel Kemper, numbered at 600 to 900 men, had taken over. The Spanish Royal Army of Texas, under Governor Manuel Mar√≠a de Salcedo and Nuevo Le√≥n Governor Sim√≥n de Herrera, had retreated to San Antonio. In March 1813, the Spanish army, numbering 950 to 1,500, had planned an ambush on the republicans as they marched and searched for food along the creek banks. The republicans caught sight of the royal forces first and routed them within an hour, killing between 100 and 330 soldiers and capturing most of their arms and ammunition, six cannons, and 1,500 horses and mules, at the expense of only six men. After the battle, the Spanish army retreated to San Antonio, signed a truce with Kemper on April 1, and surrendered Salcedo and Herrera. On April 3, Salcedo, Herrera, and 12 prisoners of war were executed by a vengeful Mexican soldier (Capt. Antonio Delgado), near the site of the battle. On April 6, 1813, the first Declaration of Independence and Constitution for Texas were drafted and Guti√©rrez was named president, establishing the first Republic of Texas. The new republic was destroyed four months later, at the fateful Battle of Medina.Handbook of Texas Online, June 6, 2001 A later Battle of Salado Creek (1842) was fought between the volunteers of the Texas Republic and the Mexican forces of Brig. General and French Mexican soldier Adri√°n Woll. The conflict began following Brig. General R√°fael V√°squez's incursion into San Antonio in March 1842. The volunteers prepared for battle, but believed that peace was on the horizon after the release of prisoners from the failed Texan Santa Fe Expedition. Because of this, a potential attack was called off by President Sam Houston. However, on September 11, 1842, Brig. Gen. Adri√°n Woll entered San Antonio with 1,000 regular infantry and 500 irregular cavalry. After this, about 200 volunteers from Gonzales, Seguin, and other lower Colorado River settlements joined together under Capt. Mathew Caldwell on the east bank of Salado Creek. They met with Capt. John C. Hays's regiment of 14 rangers. The men took advantage of their good position on the bank and killed 60 Mexicans, losing only one of their own.Thomas W. Cutrer, \\"SALADO CREEK, BATTLE OF,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed July 2, 2014. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Simultaneously, Capt. Nicholas Mosby Dawson was traveling from La Grange with his 53-man company of volunteers to meet with Caldwell. Cut off from the larger body of their men and surrounded by Mexicans, they surrendered after a brief skirmish. The Mexicans killed 36 Texians and wounded several others, in what Americans called the Dawson Massacre.\\"Dawson Massacre\\". Handbook of Texas Online. Retrieved July 2, 2014.

The work was written in the midst of the Jacobite rising of 1745‚Äì1746, the attempt to overthrow Handel's patrons the Hanoverian monarchy under George II and replace them with a Stuart restoration under Charles Edward Stuart, \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\". The Occasional Oratorio is unique among Handel's works which he labelled \\"oratorio\\" in that it does not tell a story or contain elements of a drama, but was intended as a defiant and patriotic rallying piece. The Stuart armies, based in Scotland, had invaded England and got as far as Derby when the King's armies under the command of the King's son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland had driven them back to Scotland in December 1745. The fighting was at a hiatus due to winter weather and the Duke of Cumberland was in London in February 1746. Handel composed the Occasional Oratorio hastily in January and February 1746, \\"borrowing\\" and re- arranging some movements from previous compositions, and premiered it immediately on 14 February 1746 with Willem de Fesch, √âlisabeth Duparc, Elisabetta de Gambarini, John Beard (tenor), and Thomas Reinhold at Covent Garden Theatre. It contains 44 movements split over three parts. Part One, generally speaking, concerns the miseries of war and the vengeance of a wrathful God, Part Two the blessings of peace, and Part Three a thanksgiving for victory. This was felt at the time by some to be premature as the rebels had not yet been defeated, Charles Jennens, Handel's friend and collaborator who wrote the text for Saul and others of Handel's oratorios called the piece \\"a triumph for a victory not yet gained.\\" The festive four part overture, with trumpets and drums, is sometimes performed outside the context of the entire piece. The famous chorus \\"Prepare the Hymn\\" (a paraphrase of Psalm 81:1-2) is the 26th movement and appears in the second part. The second minuet from the Music for the Royal Fireworks was reused from this oratorio.C. Hogwood, Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks Cambridge University Press, p. 133 Handel's coronation anthem Zadok the Priest was also reused as the finale to the oratorio, but excluded the second movement \\"And all the people rejoic'd\\".

In 1766, John Charrington joined the company, which then traded as Westfield, Moss & Charrington from the Anchor Brewery in Stepney. It merged with United Breweries of London in 1964 to become Charrington United Breweries, then, after acquiring a number of other breweries, it merged with Bass Brewery in 1967 to become the largest UK brewing company, Bass Charrington, later simply Bass plc. The brewing operations of the company were bought by Interbrew (now Anheuser-Busch InBev) in 2000, while the retail side (hotel and pub holdings) were renamed Six Continents. In 2003 Six Continents split into a pubs business, now known as Mitchells & Butlers, and a hotels and soft drinks business, now known as InterContinental Hotels Group.Six Continents split creates two new ADR's findarticles.com History The company was formed in Bethnal Green in the early 18th century by Robert Westfield. He is known to have been a member of the Brewers' Company from 1738. In 1757, Joseph Moss became a partner, and the brewery moved to new premises at Anchor Brewery in Mile End. In 1766, John Charrington, who had brewed with Hale brewers in Islington, became third partner in the company, which then traded as Westfield, Moss & Charrington. Westfield retired in 1769, and his share in the partnership was purchased by Charrington. After Moss retired in 1783, Charrington and his brother, Henry, were in full control of the business. Henry (Harry) lived at Malplaquet House, 137-139 Mile End Road, from 1794-1833. By 1807/8, they were the second largest brewers in London, producing 20,252 barrels of beer per year. Following Charrington's death in 1815, the business was continued by his brother and his son, Nicholas, who had joined the partnership in 1806. The firm acquired Steward & Head in Stratford-upon-Avon, in 1833 and subsequently traded as Charrington & Head Co. The company took over Lewis Meakin's Abbey Brewery in Burton upon Trent in 1872 to become one of the breweries in Burton. Nicholas's two sons, Edward and Spencer, succeeded their father in 1859, and following the death of Head in 1880, the firm was known as Charrington & Co. The London and Burton breweries were operated as separate concerns until 1897, when Charrington & Co Ltd was registered in July to acquire the business of both breweries. The People‚Äôs Refreshment House Association's large chain of freehold and leasehold properties were acquired by Charrington & Co. Ltd. from the beginning of 1962. In 1962, Charrington United Breweries Limited was registered to undertake the merger of Charrington & Co Ltd and United Breweries Ltd by an exchange of shares. In 1967, Charrington merged with Bass and Mitchell & Butlers and formed Bass Charrington Limited. In 1997, Bass Charrington sold off its public houses. The buyer then created Punch Taverns. In 2000, the company sold off its brands to Interbrew and remaining properties to Six Continents. Breweries The Anchor Brewery on Mile End Road ceased production in January 1975, but remained the company's head office. By now, most of the brewery buildings have been demolished. Bottling and warehousing facilities were also housed in a former distillery at Three Mills, in Bromley- by-Bow. Today, the site at Three Mills is used as offices serving a film studio complex, and the main Anchor Brewery site has been redeveloped as housing, offices and a shopping centre.Charrington United Breweries Ltd (Brewery History Society) accessed 18 Feb 2008 The company took over the brewing business of: * Gray and Dacre Brewery, West Ham, Essex, in 1846. * Joseph Friends Bell, Peterborough Lane, Parson's Green, Fulham, London, in 1890. * Walter & John Fline East, Oil Mill Lane, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey in 1891. * Walker & Son Ltd, Wellington Brewery, Wellington Street, Gravesend, Kent in 1903. * Campbell, Johnstone & Co.

It was a part of the famed Michigan Brigade, commanded for a time by Brigadier General George Armstrong Custer. Service The 6th Michigan Cavalry was organized at Grand Rapids, Michigan, from May 28 to October 13, 1862, and mustered in October 13, 1862. Among the officers who later joined the regiment as replacements were Thomas W. Custer, who would earn two Medals of Honor while serving with the 6th in the spring of 1865. The regiment was assigned to what became the Michigan Brigade during the early part of the Gettysburg Campaign in June 1863. It saw its first actions under General Custer at the Hanover, Hunterstown, and Gettysburg. Armed with Spencer Repeating Rifles, the 6th provided superior firepower against the lightly armed Confederate cavalry. Sent out to the Old West frontier following the cessation of hostilities in mid-1865, the 6th, commanded by Colonel James H. Kidd and under the overall command of Brigadier General Patrick Connor constructed \\"Fort Connor\\" as a supply depot during the Powder River Expeditions of that summer. A detachment of the regiment guarding James A. Sawyers wagon train participated in the Sawyers Fight of August and September, 1865. The regiment was mustered out of service on November 24, 1865. Total strength and casualties The regiment suffered 7 officers and 128 enlisted men killed in action or mortally wounded and 251 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 386 fatalities.

Spare parts, are extra parts that are available and in proximity to a functional item, such as an automobile, boat, engine, for which they might be used for repair.  Economic considerations  Spare parts are sometimes considered uneconomical since: * the parts might never be used * the parts might not be stored properly, leading to defects * maintaining inventory of spare parts has associated costs * parts may not be available when needed from a supplier But without the spare part on hand, a company's customer satisfaction levels could drop if a customer has to wait too long for their item to be fixed. Therefore, companies need to plan and align their service parts inventory and workforce resources to achieve optimal customer satisfaction levels with minimal costs.  User considerations  The user of the item, which might require the parts, may overlook the economic considerations because: * the expense is not the user's but the supplier's * of a known high rate of failure of certain equipment * of delays in getting the part from a vendor or a supply room, resulting in machine outage * to have the parts on hand requires less \\"paperwork\\" when the parts are suddenly needed * of the mental comfort it provides to the user in knowing the parts are on- hand when needed * The parts are un-economic to be repaired i.e. it's cheaper to discard than to get it repaired  Cost-effect compromise  In many cases where the item is not stationary, a compromise is reached between cost and statistical probability. Some examples: * an automobile carries a less- functional \\"donut\\" tire as replacement instead of a functionally equivalent tire. * a member of a household buys extra light bulbs since it is probable that one of the lights in the house will eventually burn out and require replacement. * a computer user will purchase a ream of computer paper instead of a sheet at a time. * a race car team will bring another engine to the race track \\"just in case\\". * a ship carries \\"spare parts\\" for its engine in case of breakdown at sea.  Measures of effectiveness  The effectiveness of spares inventory can be measured by metrics such as fill rate and availability of the end item.

Early life  Ferguson was born in Asuom His father was Robert Archibald Ferguson, who worked for the trading company F. & A. Swanzy in Winneba, while his grandfather, Samuel Ferguson, had been a colonial doctor. He had a twin brother, who died in infancy, and four sisters. Little is known of his mother except that she was a Christian. Ferguson was born into a family at the top of the colonial social hierarchy, whose lifestyle was heavily influenced by British customs. (Arhin 1985, p. 1) Ferguson was educated from an early age, attending primary school at Cape Coast. He proceeded to enter the Wesleyan Boys High School, Freetown, in 1876. His studies there included mathematics, geography, British and ancient history, classics, French, photography and religious education. The school had been founded by leading Krio, who sympathised with the goals of British imperialism. The curriculum was therefore designed to promote the superiority of British values.  Career  Major settlements visited by Ferguson during his 1890 journey from Accra to Atebubu He left school in 1881, and, considering becoming a Methodist minister, returned to Cape Coast, where he worked as a teacher at the Wesleyan Boy's High School. Later in the year, he joined the Colonial Service and received a position at the Governor's office. In November 1882, he was appointed as Clerk to the Queen's Advocate, with a salary of ¬£60. By 1886 he had returned to the Governor's office, as a Junior Clerk, and by 1889 he had been promoted to Second Clerk, with a salary of ¬£120. During this period, he travelled with the Governor on visits to Prasu (1881), to Lagos (1881, 1882, 1884), to Keta, Ada, Krobo and Akwapim (1882) and to Wassa and Nzima (1888). Ferguson was invaluable to the colonial authorities in the arbitration of tribal disputes, such as that between the Krobo and Akwamu in 1886, because he could speak Fanti and Ga, allowing him to communicate with the vast majority of the southern inhabitants of the colony. He also produced a map of the colony and conducted a survey of the water supply of Accra during this period as part of his official duties. After eight years service as a junior civil servant, Ferguson applied to study one-year course at the Royal College of Science, London. He was given paid leave by the colonial authorities, who encouraged his educational ambitions. In London, he studied mining, geology, surveying, mathematics and astronomy; performing well in his June exams, he received a First Class diploma. (Arhin 1985, p. 5) In September 1890, he returned to the Gold Coast. On October 21 of the same year, the Governor asked Ferguson to travel from Accra to Atebubu, in order to prospect for precious stones, as well as producing a report on the quality of the roads and the status of local trade. Upon reaching Atebubu, Ferguson negotiated a treaty with the local chiefs, who feared aggression from Asante, which they had seceded from in 1875. (Ahrin 1985, pp. 7‚Äì8) His report from the expedition was published and may have influenced Albert Ernest Kitson to search for diamonds in the region in 1919. (Ahrin 1974, pp. 26‚Äì7) Ferguson was appointed as a Supernumerary Foreman of Works in 1891. In the same year he was ordered to survey the River Volta and Keta lagoon. The colonial authorities were interested in the possibility of filling the lagoon from the river during the dry season, to prevent the lagoon becoming unnavigable. (Thomas 1972, pp. 181‚Äì215) Ferguson also worked on a proposed light railway to transport gold from Ancobra to the port of Axim. The border between Gold Coast and the German colony of Togoland had been fixed in 1887, temporarily creating a neutral zone which contained important towns such as Salaga and Bimbila. In 1890, the Heligoland‚ÄìZanzibar Treaty resulted in a redemarcation, and in 1892 Ferguson assisted two British District Commissioners in surveying the new border. The maps produced by the British were significantly better than those by their German counterparts, mainly due to Ferguson's involvement in the project. (Arhin 1985, p. 6) He took additional responsibilities as Inspector of Trade Roads from October 1893.

History People's Druzhinas in support of law enforcement were introduced in Russian Empire in 1913. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 there were various forms of non-governmental workers and peasants' organizations, which were disbanded by the early 1930s. Instead the Voluntary Society for Support of Militsiya (–û–°–û–î–ú–ò–õ) was created. In 1932 it was subordinated to militsiya and renamed to \\"Militsiya Support Brigades\\". (–ë–†–ò–ì–ê–î–ú–ò–õ). History of People's Druzhinas, which counted over 400,000 personnel. Soviet Union The system of VPDs was introduced according to the joint resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers of March 2, 1959 On the Participation of the Workers in the Maintenance of Public Order, which formalized and widely propagated the 1958 Leningrad invention of the Voluntary People's Druzhina formally independent of militsiya. The druzhinas were not subordinated to militsiya and the management staff was established from various Soviet organizations: Soviets, trade unions, Komsomol, etc. The patrolling druzhinas themselves were often accompanied by police officers (militsioners), for general guidance and official support. Although druzhinas were informal, they could perform citizen arrests of various petty offenders: drunkards, hooligans, etc. They were also used to support militsiya in performing non-dangerous arrests and other law enforcement duties.Voluntary Militia and Courts, Soviet Studies, Vol. 11, No. 2 (October , 1959), pp. 214-217 The 1974 USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium Ukase \\"About the Main Duties and Rights of Voluntary People's Drushina in Guarding the Public Order\\" governed the druzhinas until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Druzhinas mostly operated in urban neighborhoods. Druzhinniks were distinguished by red armbands with the text \\"–î–ù–î\\" or \\"–¥—Ä—É–∂–∏–Ω–Ω–∏–∫\\" on them. Russia Attempts to reestablish public law enforcement organizations in Russia started as early as in 1992.

He served as president of the Slovene Writers' Association (1991‚Äì1995), and was awarded the prestigious Pre≈°eren Award for lifetime achievement (1981). Together with Edvard Kocbek and Gregor Strni≈°a, he is considered as the most important Slovenian poet of the second half of the 20th century.  Life  He was born as Danijel Zajc in the Upper Carniolan village of Zgornja Javor≈°ica near Moravƒçe, in a relatively wealthy peasant family. He was traumatized by the experience of World War II. At the age of 13, he witnessed the brutal death of his father, when the Nazis burned his native house, throwing his father in the flames. Two of his brothers fell in the partisan resistance. During the war years, he dropped out of school. He continued his education after 1945, first in a special course for young war victims in Dom≈æale, and then in Kamnik and Gornja Radgona. In 1947, he enrolled in the Poljane Grammar School in Ljubljana. During this time, he befriended several young writers and poets. Together with Lojze Kovaƒçiƒç, Viktor Bla≈æiƒç in Janez Menart, he founded the youth literary magazine called Mi, mladi (We, the Young); where he published his first poems. In 1951, he was arrested by the Communist authorities, and sentenced to three months in prison. As a result, he was expelled from the Poljane grammar school. After his release from prison, he was drafted to the Yugoslav People's Army. Bad experiences with the Yugoslav Communist regime affirmed his skepticism against the Communist ideology, turning him into a lifelong anti-Communist. Between 1953 and 1955, he worked as a clerk at the post office. In 1955, he got a job at the City Library of Ljubljana, where he worked until retirement in 1989. In 1958, he completed his high school with external exams, but was not allowed to enroll to the university. In the mid 1950s, Zajc became part of a circle of critical Slovene intellectuals, known as the Critical generation. The group was formed by poets (besides Zajc, also Gregor Strni≈°a and Veno Taufer), writers (Lojze Kovaƒçiƒç, Marjan Ro≈æanc, Rudi ≈†eligo), playwrights (Dominik Smole, Primo≈æ Kozak), and theoreticians (Taras Kermauner, Veljko Rus, Janko Kos, Jo≈æe Puƒçnik). They introduced contemporary existentialist currents in Slovenia, opening a series of discussions regarding philosophical, cultural and political issues of the time. Zajc was member of the editorial board of the alternative journal Revija 57, the first independent journal in Slovenia after 1945, and of the journal Perspektive. After both journals were banned by the Communist regime, Zajc withdrew from public life, but continued writing and publishing his poetry and plays. He again returned to the public scene in the late 1980s, during the Slovenian Spring, becoming a vocal supporter of the Slovenian Democratic Opposition. During the 1990s, he served as president of the Slovenian Writers' Association. He died in Ljubljana. The American singer and songwriter Chris Eckman released a CD in 2008 called \\"The Last Side of the Mountain\\". It contains more than 10 adaptations of poems by Dane Zajc, translated into English by Eckman's Slovenian wife Anda Eckman.

The compound is a white solid (not colorless), although commercial samples appear yellow. It is one of the most common fire retardants. Production and use TBBPA is produced by the reaction of bromine with bisphenol A. Most commercial TBBPA products consist of a mixture that differ in the degree of bromination with the formula C15H16‚àíxBrxO2 where x = 1 to 4. Its fire-retarding properties correlate with %Br.The annual consumption in Europe has been estimated as 6.200 tons in 2004.Draft EU Risk Assessment of 2,2‚Ä≤,6,6‚Ä≤- TETRABROMO-4,4‚Ä≤-ISOPRYOPYLIDENE DIPHENOL, Final Environmental Draft of June 2007 TBBPA is mainly used as a reactive component of polymers, meaning that it is incorporated into the polymer backbone. It is used to prepare fire- resistant polycarbonates by replacing some bisphenol A. A lower grade of TBBPA is used to prepare epoxy resins, used in printed circuit boards. Structure of copolymer of polycarbonate containing the tetrabrominated monomer Toxicity A study was published by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in December 2011 on the exposure of TBBPA and its derivatives in food. The study, which examined at 344 food samples from the fish and other seafood food group, concluded that ‚Äúcurrent dietary exposure to TBBPA in the European Union does not raise a health concern.‚Äù EFSA also determined that ‚Äúadditional exposure, particularly of young children, to TBBPA from house dust is unlikely to raise a health concern‚Äù.EFSA Scientific Opinion on Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and its derivatives in food (2011) https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2477. See page 1. Some studies suggest that TBBPA may be an endocrine disruptor and immunotoxicant. As an endocrine disruptor, TBBPA may interfere with both estrogens and androgens. Further, TBBPA structurally mimics the thyroid hormone thyroxin (T4) and can bind more strongly to the transport protein transthyretin than T4 does, likely interfering with normal T4 activity. TBBPA likely also suppresses immune responses by inhibiting expression of CD25 receptors on T cells, preventing their activation, and by reducing natural killer cell activity. A 2013 literature review on TBBPA concludes that TBBPA does not produce ‚Äúadverse effects that might be considered to be related to disturbances in the endocrine system‚Äù. Therefore, in accordance with internationally accepted definitions, TBBPA should not be considered an ‚Äúendocrine disruptor‚Äù. Furthermore, TBBPA is rapidly excreted in mammals and therefore does not have a potential for bioaccumulation. Measured concentrations of TBBPA in house dust, human diet and human serum samples are very low. Daily intakes of TBBPA in humans were estimated to not exceed a few ng/kg bw/day. Exposures of the general population are also well below the derived-no-effect-levels (DNELs) derived for endpoints of potential concern in REACH. TBBPA degrades to bisphenol A and to TBBPA dimethyl ether, and experiments in zebrafish (Danio rerio) suggest that during development, TBBPA may be more toxic than either BPA or TBBPA dimethyl ether. =Occurrence= TBBPA emits can be found in trace concentration in the hydrosphere, soil, and sediments. It also occurs in sewage sludge and house dust.Kuch B, K√∂rner W, Hagenmaier H (2001): Monitoring von bromierten Flammschutzmitteln in Fliessgew√§ssern, Abw√§ssern und Kl√§rschl√§mmen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg .

He is a martial arts master who first appeared in Green Arrow comics. In keeping with his ultimate betrayal of Green Arrow, his name is \\"Satan\\" spelled backwards. Fictional character biography After Oliver Queen, the original Green Arrow, was bleeding nearly to death in the ruins of Star City (victim of a sneak attack by Merlyn the Dark Archer), Ollie, Connor Hawke, and Mia Dearden spent months training from some of the greatest fighters in the DC Universe including Natas. To that end, Natas spends weeks beating him silly, attacking and trying to kill him, and always fighting dirty (Mia compared it to the scenes in the Pink Panther when Inspector Clouseau is attacked by Cato, except less amusing). Natas puts Ollie through a brutal trial of martial combat. Over the course of many nights, Ollie hones his body to perfection and transforms himself into a living weapon. Later, Frederick Tuckman tells Ollie about all of the things taking place in Star City. He tells him that a quarter of the city has been turned into a ghetto and that city officials have cordoned off trouble areas by erecting a large wall. Ollie uses Natas' resources to play the stock market, robbing several disreputable corporations of over a billion dollars. He decides that when he returns to Star City, he is going to use the money to place himself into the political sphere of influence. Natas says goodbye to Oliver, and leaves a note behind for him, the note reading \\"I have sent an army to kill you\\". Ollie calls Connor and Mia to attention and tells them to prepare for a fight. Natas leaves Oliver Queen and his friends with a parting gift ‚Äì a squadron of some of the world's deadliest assassins ‚Äì and they have all been assigned to kill him. Ollie brings all of his allied masters together inside of a cave. Before they can realize what he is doing, Ollie sets off a detonator, which seals the cave. He doesn't want to place Connor or Mia into a situation where they might have to question their principles. Ollie runs off into the night to greet his attackers. For the next two hours, Ollie races about the island playing cat and mouse games with the hired killers. He baits several of them into any number of a series of traps, and uses their own skills and insights against them. He corrals many of them to one side of the island, then sets off another explosive charge, blocking their escape route. Ollie finally defeats enough of the hired guns that a stalemate is called. Connor and the others manage to free themselves from the cave, and apprehend the remaining killers.Green Arrow #68 Ollie is now prepared to return to Star City, partially encouraged by a second note Natas left that leaves him a sword to include as part of his arsenal (while also asking him to remove the hat from his costume).

Meanwhile, Constantine Drakon and Deathstroke murder two prison guards and escape from Alcatraz Island. Deathstroke radios his old master, Natas, and tells him that he is free.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Langenlonsheim-Stromberg, whose seat is in Langenlonsheim. Laubenheim is a winegrowing village. Geography =Location= Laubenheim, a village of some 900 inhabitants, lies between Bingen am Rhein to the north and Bad Kreuznach to the south, right on the Nahe just up from the place where it empties into the Rhine. Laubenheim lies alee of the Hunsr√ºck and has a mild climate, which is favourable to the vineyards that are kept above the village.Location =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Laubenheim's neighbours are the municipality of M√ºnster-Sarmsheim, the town of Bingen am Rhein and the municipalities of Grolsheim (all three of which lie in the neighbouring Mainz-Bingen district), Langenlonsheim and Dorsheim (both of which likewise lie in the Bad Kreuznach district). =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Laubenheim is the outlying homestead of Laubenheimerm√ºhle.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 15 (PDF; 2,3 MB) History There is little doubt but that Laubenheim's beginnings go back to Celtic times. Roman watermains in the ‚ÄúSandgrube‚Äù and many coin, pot, grave and sarcophagus finds from Roman times in the northern half of Laubenheim's municipal area also bear witness to people in the area at that time. It was also the Romans who brought grapevines to the Nahe valley in the 1st century AD. They were surely drawn to the valley's south-facing slopes as a good place to plant vineyards. As far back as the 9th century, a donation document from Charlemagne‚Äôs son Louis the Pious (814-843) reports of Laubenheim (829). In the State Archive at Koblenz, and furthermore in the Land Archive at Schlo√ü Gracht (a moated ch√¢teau) near Liblar, a place called Luibenheim crops up often in documents as a winegrowing village, as it does too at the Count of Spree‚Äôs archive at Schlo√ü Heltorf near D√ºsseldorf-Angermund, the so-called Reypoltzkirchensche Archiv. According to these records, the village was an appurtenance of the lordship of Reichenstein, held by the Lords of Hohenfels, lords at Reypoltzkirchen (Reipoltskirchen). In 1410, Duke Stephan of Palatinate-Simmern signed the village of Laubenheim over to his wife as a ‚Äúproper morning gift‚Äù. According to a cadastral map from the time, this did not include a Carthusian monastery that was here then. From this comital- palatine time also comes the municipal coat of arms used today. It began as a court seal that bore the same composition today seen in the arms, and also a circumscription that read ‚ÄúSiegel von Laubenheim an der Nahe 1602‚Äù (‚ÄúSeal of Laubenheim on the Nahe 1602‚Äù). The vine hung with three bunches of grapes show that winegrowing was already important to the village even then. In the Thirty Years' War, Laubenheim was often set ablaze by Spanish or Swedish troops. In the 17th century, it suffered greatly under French marauders‚Äô atrocities during the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession). Laubenheim was almost utterly destroyed. Under French Revolutionary ‚Äì and shortly thereafter Napoleonic ‚Äì rule, Laubenheim was grouped in 1800 into the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Langenlonsheim. This body remained in force even after Napoleon's defeat and the assignment of the lands north of the River Nahe by the Congress of Vienna to the Kingdom of Prussia, although the German word B√ºrgermeisterei was now used.History =Jewish history= Living in Laubenheim from the 18th to the 20th century were a few Jewish families, who until 1895 belonged to the Waldhilbersheim-Heddesheim Jewish community, and thereafter to the community in Langenlonsheim. In the 19th century, the number of Jewish inhabitants developed as follows: in 1843, there were 5; in 1858, 6; in 1895, 7; in 1925, 6. In 1808, at the time when Jewish families adopted surnames, two community members were named: Leser Mayer, who now became Lazarus Mayer, and his son Isaak Mayer. In the decades that followed, Jewish family names other than Mayer also cropped up in records, such as Kahn and Marx. In 1933, the year when Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power, there was still one Jewish family living in Laubenheim, salesman Moritz Kahn, his wife Erna n√©e Stern from Heddesheim and their two sons, Erich (b. 1921) and Fritz (b. 1924). In 1939, they were forced to sell their property below market value. The family moved to Cologne. The elder son, Erich, managed to get out of Germany in time in 1940. Erich joined the American Air Force and fought against the Japanese. The other three, however, were deported 7 December 1941 to the Riga Ghetto. Moritz Kahn was murdered in Riga, Erna Stern Kahn did not survive the concentration camp Stutthof. Fritz (later Fred) Kahn survived several concentration camps and was freed by Soviet troops on 10 March 1945. Fred immigrated to the United States in 1950. According to the Gedenkbuch ‚Äì Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933-1945 (‚ÄúMemorial Book ‚Äì Victims of the Persecution of the Jews under National Socialist Tyranny‚Äù) and Yad Vashem, of all Jews who either were born in Laubenheim or lived there for a long time, 2 died in the time of the Third Reich (birthdates in brackets): # Moritz Kahn (1885) # Erna Kahn n√©e Stern (1899)Jewish history Religion As at 30 September 2013, there are 803 full-time residents in Laubenheim, and of those, 329 are Evangelical (40.971%), 241 are Catholic (30.012%), 15 (1.868%) belong to other religious groups and 218 (27.148%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Located from 1981 at Broadway and West 84th Street in Manhattan, the establishment was an Upper West Side retail institution alongside the likes of Zabar's delicatessen, the Thalia movie theater, and the Murder Ink bookstore. Morris Brothers became best known for its sale of summer camp clothing, often to generations of the same family. History Morris Krumholtz and his brother founded Morris Brothers in 1939 or 1943 (sources differ) as an Army-Navy store on Second Avenue and East 101st Street in Manhattan. The store later moved to Broadway and West 98th Street before moving first to Broadway and 85th Street and finally, in 1981, to 2322 Broadway, at West 84th Street. The family expanded that space in 1985 to . The original store's merchandise expanded over the years to include children's clothing, before eventually dropping infant and toddlerwear to become a casualwear family clothing store and camp outfitter. Labeling summer-camp wear with children's names become a hallmark, creating a tradition that helped retain as customers former New Yorkers who had moved to the suburbs.

United States, 409 U.S. 352 (1973), is a seminalTiersma, Peter; Did Clinton Lie? Defining \\"Sexual Relations\\" ,; 79 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 927, 939, 2004. United States Supreme Court decision strictly construing the federal perjury statute. Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for a unanimous Court that responses to questions made under oath that relayed truthful information in and of themselves but were intended to mislead or evade the examiner could not be prosecuted. Instead, the criminal-justice system had to rely on more carefully worded follow-up questions. The decision has been cited in many cases since then and has become the controlling legal standard of perjury in federal jurisprudence. It was invoked during Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings in 1998 as a defense to charges of perjury against him. It has long been criticized for the loophole it creates in the perjury statutes as essentially allowing a witness to lie without consequences. Nevertheless, later Courts have refused to overrule or otherwise limit it despite some moves in that direction by lower courts. Background of the case Samuel Bronston was a New York-based movie producer who, between 1959 and 1964, made films in various European countries as Samuel Bronston Productions, Inc., a company he wholly owned. He was a pioneer in using countries such as Spain to take advantage of lower production costs. As part of its business operations, the company maintained bank accounts in the countries in which it did business ‚Äî 37 separate accounts in five different countries, it would be established later.. In 1964, after the epic The Fall of the Roman Empire failed, the company filed for federal bankruptcy protection. Two years later, its owner was being questioned under oath at a creditors' committee meeting about the company's overseas assets. It included the following exchange between Bronston and one of the lawyers for his creditors: All those answers were truthful, although the second one is not a direct answer to the question. It would later be discovered that Bronston personally had had an account with International Credit Bank in Geneva, on which he made deposits and drew checks totalling up to $180,000 during the five years in which the company was active and closed just before the bankruptcy filing. As a result, the matter was referred to federal prosecutors, who secured a perjury indictment against Bronston. =Trial= The government contended that Bronston intentionally answered the second of the series of questions by referring to the company's account in Zurich instead of his own personal one, as the questioner had implied, to leave the impression that he did not have and never had had an account in Switzerland, which was not true. Jurors were instructed that they must consider the witness's state of mind, that if they found that Bronston \\"fully understood the questions put to him but nevertheless gave false answers knowing the same to be false\\",Bronston, 409 U.S. at 355. they should convict him. After seven hours of deliberations, during which they requested not only additional instructions but that the original instructions be read back to them, as well as reviewing several exhibits in the case, they returned a conviction. =Appeal= On appeal, Bronston claimed the key question was imprecise and that he should not have been convicted for making an answer that was true and accurate.Bronston, 409 U.S. at 356. A divided court upheld the conviction on the grounds that \\"an answer containing half of the truth which also constitutes a lie by negative implication, when the answer is intentionally given in place of the responsive answer called for by a proper question, is perjury\\". The circuit's chief judge, J. Edward Lumbard, dissented, arguing the proper remedy for such answers was \\"questioner's acuity\\".Bronston, 409 U.S. at 362. Bronston's attorneys filed for certiorari from the Supreme Court, and got it in 1971. Decision The Court heard arguments on November 15, 1972. Sheldon Elsen argued for Bronston, with Andrew Frey taking the federal government's side. Less than two months later, the Court issued its brief ruling, unanimously siding with the appellant. While he conceded that Bronston's answer may have been intended to mislead, Burger felt it would be going far beyond Congress's intent to apply the statute that broadly.Bronston, 409 U.S. at 358. He considered Bronston's answer to be a \\"testimonial mishap that could readily have been reached with a single additional question by counsel alert ‚Äî as every examiner ought to be ‚Äî to the incongruity of petitioner's unresponsive answer\\", a point he reiterates several times throughout the opinion. Such an application also conflicted with the literal wording of the law, which defined perjury as willfully stating under oath any material matter which the witness does not believe to be true.Bronston, 409 U.S. at 357. A casual listener might have believed from Bronston's answer that he himself had never had any Swiss bank accounts, he agreed. \\"But we are not dealing with casual conversation and the statute does not make it a criminal act for a witness to willfully state any material matter that implies any material matter that he does not believe to be true\\" since intent to mislead or evade might not be the underlying reason: \\"Under the pressures and tensions of interrogation, it is not uncommon for the most earnest witnesses to give answers that are not entirely responsive. Sometimes the witness does not understand the question, or may in an excess of caution or apprehension read too much or too little into it.\\" Witnesses, he understood, might also be reluctant to discuss personally embarrassing matters, particularly in a bankruptcy proceeding. \\"If a witness evades, it is the lawyer's responsibility to recognize the evasion and to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination.\\" The trial jury's finding that Bronston had intended to mislead was of no consequence, and indeed should not have been a determination they were allowed to make: He reviewed the history of perjury, and recalled that when it first started being prosecuted, authorities realized it had to be narrowly construed, otherwise people would be deterred from testifying over fears of being prosecuted themselves. Existing case law supported that position as well.Bronston, 409 U.S. at 359-60. \\"Precise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury\\", he said, one last time, a sentence frequently quoted since then.Bronston, 409 U.S. at 362. Legacy The standard established by the decision has become known in criminal law as the \\"literal truth\\" rule\\"The Perils of Perjury \\", 112 Harvard L Rev 1783-1788; retrieved June 25, 2007. (the \\"stark contrast\\" rule requiring perjury indictments to set out the difference between the allegedly false testimony and the actual truth is often attributed to this case, but arose in a latter appellate decision). Over the years since it was handed down, Bronston has remained, in the words of one commentator, \\"much-maligned\\".Green, Stuart; November 2001; Lying, Misleading and Falsely Denying: How Moral Concepts Inform the Law of Perjury, Fraud and False Statements ; 63 Hastings Law Journal 158, 176; retrieved June 22, 2007. Criticisms have ranged from prosecutors upset at the limitations it placed on their ability to use the threat of perjury prosecution to compel truthful testimony from hostile witnesses to a Wake Forest professor who cites it as among many aspects of the legal system that have caused a general decline in morality when they became broadly applied outside of the practice of law.Castleman, Don; 2004; Paper 380, \\"Has The Law Made Liars of Us All?\\"; retrieved from bepress.com June 22, 2007. Bronston was never able to successfully return to producing films afterwards, managing to make only 1984's Fort Saganne, a French film directed by Alain Corneau. He died ten years later.Lyons, Richard D.; January 15, 1994; \\"Samuel Bronston, Film Producer, 85; Made Epic 'El Cid'\\"; The New York Times; retrieved June 27, 2007. =Clinton impeachment defense= The case came to the fore in 1998, when Bill Clinton's attorneys invoked it as a defense to perjury charges brought by the House of Representatives during his impeachment.December 8, 1998; White House Rebuttal Parts IV-VI (specifically, Part IV.C \\"\\"Literal Truth\\" and Non-Responsive Answers Do Not Constitute Perjury); reprinted in The Washington Post; retrieved June 24, 2007. They argued that lawyers for Paula Jones had failed to follow up on questions asking Clinton generally if he had ever been alone with Monica Lewinsky to which he had answered \\"I don't recall\\". Even though later testimony had established that she was indeed alone with him on several brief occasions, he had not specifically denied it and that the Jones lawyers' failure to ask follow-up questions about specific occasions barred prosecution as surely as the similar failure by Bronston's questioner. They also cited other occasions where Clinton had similarly claimed he didn't remember, and his questioners had simply left the answer at that. The president's purportedly false testimony was, to them, \\"simply a confused deposition record that could have been clarified contemporaneously\\". In response, House impeachment manager Steve Chabot called the resort to Bronston \\"the cornerstone of the president's defense\\" and a \\"legal smokescreen\\", when presenting the case to the Senate.Chabot, Steve; January 15, 1999; Jan. 15: Chabot on Perjury Law; The Washington Post; retrieved June 24, 2007. Clinton, he claimed, could very well remember those things he claimed not to. \\"[T]he record establishes\\", Chabot told senators, \\"that the President repeatedly lied, he repeatedly deceived, he repeatedly feigned forgetfulness.\\" In 2004, Loyola professor Peter Tiersma, who specializes in language and the law, analyzed Clinton's alleged perjuries closely under the Bronston standard and concluded that while he had not broken the law, he was likely aware of the literal-truth standard from his own time as a law professorTiersma at 940. and was certainly exploiting it to mislead his questioners. They erred, he said, in coming up with their own definition of sexual relations, which allowed Clinton to look for ambiguities and then take advantage of them on the stand.Tiersma at 956. Conflicting appellate cases As with other Supreme Court cases, those who have disagreed with Bronston have looked for test cases that might give another set of Supreme Court justices a chance to revisit the original ruling and, if not overrule it, at least limit its scope. Two such cases that reached the federal appeals courts gave rise to such hopes (or fears) with regard to Bronston, but neither made it past that level. =United States v. Robbins= Like Bronston, this 1988 case arose from a bankruptcy proceeding. Robbins was testifying about a company he had formed called MacArthur and 11th Properties. His questioner mistakenly asked about \\"11th and Meridian\\". He answered that that name was unfamiliar to him but he knew of an \\"11th and MacArthur\\". Both those answers were true but as a result the line of questioning about the real company was dropped. The Eighth Circuit upheld his conviction five years later on the grounds that \\"[a]bsent fundamental ambiguity or impreciseness in the questioning, the meaning and truthfulness of the declarant's answer is for the jury.\\" The Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Legal commentator Barry Tarlow distinguishes the case from Bronston, however, by noting that in this case the defendant had more actively misled the questioner, by volunteering a different yet equally erroneous version of the company name.Tarlow, Barry; May 1999; RICO Report; Champion; retrieved from nacdl.org June 25, 12007. =United States v. DeZarn= Later in the 1990s came the DeZarn case. It began with an investigation into possible Hatch Act violations by officers of the Kentucky National Guard. Key to the case was a 1990 Preakness Day party attended by Robert DeZarn, later made adjutant general by Brereton Jones after the latter was elected governor. DeZarn was being questioned about that party by Col. Robert Tripp of the Army Inspector General's office, under oath, when he was mistakenly asked about a 1991 party, which was not at issue. He testified truthfully about it. As a result, the investigators issued a report that the allegations were unsubstantiated. After the report, another Guard officer came to Tripp and his colleagues with new information which did substantiate some of the allegations, and revealed to them DeZarn's role in the 1990 party. He was indicted on a perjury charge in 1996. His attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have the indictment dismissed on the grounds that his answers were literally truthful. The district court refused to do so since other witnesses had answered questions about the 1991 party with reference to the 1990 one, and that DeZarn's other answers had shown he knew which party was at issue. He repeated this defense at trial, while prosecutors introduced Louisville Courier-Journal articles showing that he knew very well which party investigators were concerned about. In September he was convicted, and sentenced to 15 months in prison. After his motion for a directed verdict failed, he filed an appeal. In 1998, a Sixth Circuit panel upheld the conviction (as well as his sentence, which he had argued was improperly enhanced). Gerald Rosen, Chief Judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation, distinguished DeZarn's answer from the one at issue in Bronston', by noting that DeZarn was not only aware of the party at issue, but unlike Bronston, DeZarn's answer was \\"unequivocal and directly and fully responsive\\". Rosen also pointed to subsequent answers which only made sense if DeZarn was referring to the 1991 party. DeZarn had also attempted to argue Robbins wasn't relevant, since in that case the defendant had introduced the mistake, but Judge Rosen noted that fact played no role in the verdict there. The case was never appealed beyond the Sixth Circuit. Commentators have either hailed Dezarn as \\"nudg[ing] federal criminal law closer to everyday morality\\" or decrying it as requiring witnesses to guess what a questioner really means. \\"The DeZarn decision appears to place the witness at risk ‚Äî if he or she subjectively misinterprets the state of mind of the interrogator and gives a literally true answer\\", wrote Barry Tarlow. \\"This expansion of the traditional definition of perjury is both unwise and unnecessary.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 409 References External links * *Perjury Cases -- Special Problems and Defenses -- Evasive and Unresponsive Answers from U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Resource Manual.

Worshiping her remains popular among Hindus in the southern Indian districts of Tamil Nadu,Tisak Kiamman, A aprotector of Ecology and Culture of Kanyakumari specifically the Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Salem districts. She is generally considered to be one of the 'village deities' (or kaaval deivam in Tamil) and is commonly referred to as \\"Isakki Amman\\" ('Amman' is Tamil for \\"mother\\"). Village deities are believed to act as guardian spirits. Shrines Unlike the temples of the Vedic deities, temples dedicated to Isakki are usually humble shrines decorated with a cactus-like plant known as paalkalli in Tamil. When it is damaged, these cacti ooze a milk-like sap which is considered to be a sign of the goddess Isakki. Isakki temples usually have a Banyan or bo tree located close to the shrine. Women who wish to have children often place small wooden cribs and/or tie pieces of their saris to the branches or the visible roots of the tree as an offering. Festivals Isakki Amman is associated with popular festivals that involve cooking food at the shrine and the dedication of large terracotta figures of the goddess (3 to 4 ft in height) painted in bright colors. During the festival, the deities are anointed with water, coconut milk, rosewater, honey or oil twice a day. These figures are sometimes smeared with a liquid made from mixing lime, water and turmeric (which ritually represents blood). The goddess is then offered rice, cake, fruit, milk while the presiding priest chants prayers. At the end of the ceremony and festival, the food is removed from the shrine. Iconography Yakshi Ambika of Jain Tirthankar Neminath Isakki is usually portrayed as a young woman wearing a red dress. She is usually represented by holding a child in one hand and a trident in the other. She is also sometimes represented as standing above a man who lies on the ground.The Classical Period of Indian Art :Gupta Art http://www.indianartcircle.com/arteducation/page_7_gupta.shtml Isakki corresponds to the Jain yakshi Ambika, who is always represented together with one or two children under a tree.Inscribed stele with the yakshi Ambika https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/i/inscribed_stele_with_the_yaksh.aspx Legendary origin The most common legend associated with Isakki is as follows: Ambika, a housewife, was leading a peaceful family life with her husband Somasharman and their two sons. One day the \\"dharpan\\" ritual had to be performed for the ancestors of their family and all the items were duly prepared. However, while Somasharman was away to bathe in the river, Ambika offered food to a starving sage who begged for it. Somasharman became enraged that the food for the ritual offering had been served to the sage before the necessary rites and pujas, and he chased Ambika and her children away from home. Ambika wandered until she found a calm place to rest. Realising his foolishness later, Somasharman went in to search his wife and children, but fearing him, Ambika gave up her life. After her unfortunate death, it is believed that she took the form of a Yakshini, although she still wanted to take care of her growing children. Later, she was able to regain her life for the benefit of her offspring. In doing so, Ambika became the Goddess, Isakki.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Kirner Land, whose seat is in the town of Kirn. Geography =Location= Limbach is a clump village that lies on the like-named brook, the Limbach, in the North Palatine Uplands. The outlying centre of Welschr√∂therhof lies just under 3 km to the south-southwest of the village. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Limbach's neighbours are the municipalities of Merxheim, Kirschroth, Hundsbach, Schweinschied, Hoppst√§dten, Otzweiler, Becherbach bei Kirn and Heimweiler, all of which but for Hoppst√§dten, which lies in the neighbouring Kusel district, likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Limbach is the outlying homestead of Welschr√∂therhof.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 15 (PDF; 2,3 MB) History In the Middle Ages, Limbach belonged to the Raugravial Amt of Naumburg or the court district of Becherbach, a half share of which passed to the Counts of Sponheim-Kreuznach about 1350, with the other half passing into their ownership towards the end of the 14th century. Together with Becherbach and Schmidthachenbach, Limbach was one of the biggest places in the Amt of Naumburg, which in the 18th century fell under the lordship of the Margraves of Baden. About 1600, there were 26 households in the village. Limbach, too, had to pay the Zollhafer (‚Äútoll oats‚Äù) to the Lords of Steinkallenfels whenever farmers from Limbach wanted to sell their wares at Kirn market. After French Revolutionary troops overran the German lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank, the villages in the Amt of Naumburg, which had been merged into the Amt of Herrstein in 1776, lay under French rule beginning in 1794. Limbach was grouped, along with Heimberg and Krebsweiler, into the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Hundsbach in the Canton of Meisenheim. After the Napoleonic French had been driven out, Becherbach once again became the mayoral seat for these municipalities, which now became part of the Oberamt of Meisenheim in Hesse- Homburg. During this Landgravial time, Evangelical inhabitants built a new Gothic Revival church in the years 1858 to 1860 to plans laid out by Meisenheim architect Krausch. The Catholic chapel that still stands today was built in 1893 and 1894 on the spot where the old church square once was. By 1864, Limbach, now a village of 380 inhabitants, had grown to 56 houses occupied by 94 families. In 1866, the village passed to the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1932, when the Meisenheim district was dissolved, Limbach was reassigned to the Kreuznach district. In 1940, the Amt of Becherbach was likewise dissolved, and Limbach's new Amt was then Kirn-Land, within which it still finds itself now, although it has been redefined as a Verbandsgemeinde.History Religion As at 31 October 2013, there are 305 full-time residents in Limbach, and of those, 211 are Evangelical (69.18%), 58 are Catholic (19.016%) and 36 (11.803%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Limbach's mayor is Alfons Ingenhaag, and his deputies are Klaus Herrmann and Peter Steffens.Limbach‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess Or a plough sable and chequy of azure and Or. The charge in the upper field, the plough, refers to Limbach's agricultural structure; the village was until not very many years ago still a purely agricultural community. The ‚Äúchequy‚Äù pattern in the lower field is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim. Municipal council, on 8 December 1963, gave the graphic artist Brust from Kirn-Sulzbach the task of designing a municipal coat of arms. At a council meeting on 13 April 1965, council adopted the design that had been put forth.

Time and Disillusion are personified (thus spelled with an initial capital even in Italian). Comprising two sections, the oratorio was premiered that summer in Rome. One of its famous arias is Lascia la spina, cogli la rosa (Leave the Thorn, Take the Rose), later recast as Lascia ch‚Äôio pianga (Leave Me to Weep) in the opera Rinaldo. Il trionfo del Tempo e della Verit√† (The Triumph of Time and Truth), HWV 46b Revised and expanded into three sections in March 1737, the work also had its name adjusted. Handel was by that time living in England and producing seasons of English-language oratorio and Italian opera. This version premiered on March 23, received three more performances the next month, and was revived on one date in 1739. The Triumph of Time and Truth, HWV 71 In March 1757, possibly without much involvement from the blind and aging Handel, the oratorio was further expanded and revised. The libretto was reworked into English, probably by the composer‚Äôs prolific last librettist, Thomas Morell, while John Christopher Smith Jr. probably assembled the score. Although Jephtha (1751) is considered the composer‚Äôs true last oratorio, this third version of Il trionfo comes later. Isabella Young sang the role of Counsel (Truth) at the premiere.

It is owned by Chalermchai Kositpipat, who designed, constructed, and opened it to visitors in 1997. History By the end of the 20th century, the original Wat Rong Khun was in a bad state of repair. Funds were not available for renovation. Chalermchai Kositpipat, a local artist from Chiang Rai, decided to completely rebuild the temple and fund the project with his own money. To date, Chalermchai has spent THB1,080 million on the project. The artist intends for the area adjacent to the temple to be a center of learning and meditation and for people to gain benefit from the Buddhist teachings. Kositpipat considers the temple to be an offering to Buddha and believes the project will give him immortal life. Today the works are ongoing, but are not expected to be completed until 2070. Structures and symbolism When completed, the white temple compound will have nine buildings, including the existing ubosot, a hall of relics, a meditation hall, an art gallery, and living quarters for monks. The bridge of \\"the cycle of rebirth\\": the main building at the white temple, the ubosot, is reached by crossing a bridge over a small lake. In front of the bridge are hundreds of outreaching hands that symbolize unrestrained desire. The bridge proclaims that the way to happiness is by foregoing temptation, greed, and desire. Next to the lake stand two very elegant Kinnaree, half-human, half-bird creatures from Buddhist mythology. Gate of Heaven: After crossing the bridge, the visitor arrives at the \\"gate of heaven\\", guarded by two creatures representing Death and Rahu, who decides the fate of the dead. In front of the ubosot are several meditative Buddha images. Ubosot: The principal building, the ubosot is an all-white building with fragments of mirrored glass embedded in the building's exterior. The ubosot embodies design elements from classic Thai architecture such as the three- tiered roof and abundant use of Naga serpents. \\"Inside the temple, the decor swiftly moves from pristine white to fiery and bewildering. Murals depict swirling orange flames and demon faces, interspersed with Western idols such as Michael Jackson, Neo from The Matrix, Freddy Krueger, and a T-800 series Terminator. Images of nuclear warfare, terrorist attacks such as the World Trade Center attack, and oil pumps hammer home the destructive impact that humans have had on earth. The presence of Harry Potter, Superman, and Hello Kitty confuses the message somewhat, but the overall moral is clear: people are wicked.\\" The signature of Chalermchai Kositpipat on his work golden building in Wat Rong Khun, Chiang Rai, Thailand The golden building: \\"A structure that stands out because of its color is the rest rooms building. Another very ornately decorated structure, this golden building represents the body, whereas the white ubosot represents the mind. The gold symbolizes how people focus on worldly desires and money. The white building represents the idea to make merit and to focus on the mind, instead of material things and possession.\\" 2014 earthquake On 5 May 2014 at 18:08 (local time), the temple was damaged by the earthquake in Mae Lao that struck the province. It was closed indefinitely. Chalermchai said on 6 May that he would demolish the structures for safety reasons and would not rebuild it. On May 7, after an engineering expert team inspected and affirmed that all buildings in the compound were structurally unharmed by the quake, Chalermchai announced that he would restore the temple to its original state in two years and promised to devote his life to the work. He also announced that the temple area will be open to visitors from the afternoon of 8 May. The gallery building opened shortly thereafter. But for some buildings, specifically, ubosot itself, visitors are only allowed to take pictures outside.http://www.manager.co.th/Daily/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9570000050765  Visiting  The structure is open year-round.

It was eventually superseded by an iron tower on the same foundation. History This light was built in 1868, along with the Hawkins Point Light, to provide range lights marking the Brewerton Channel, excavated in the 1850s to provide a fixed deepwater channel into Baltimore Harbor. In form, it was like no other lighthouse in the area, a brick house with a short tower holding the lantern surmounted with a tall pole supporting a large ball, to be used as a daymark. In 1924 both lights in this range were torn down and replaced with skeleton towers, which remain in use.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of R√ºdesheim, whose seat is in the municipality of R√ºdesheim an der Nahe. Mandel is a winegrowing village. Geography =Location= Mandel lies in the Naheland (the region either side of the River Nahe), south of the Hunsr√ºck, some 5 km west of Bad Kreuznach amidst vineyards, meadows and woodland. Mandel sits at an elevation of 200 m above sea level and its municipal area measures 6.33 km2. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Mandel's neighbours are the municipalities of Sankt Katharinen, Roxheim, R√ºdesheim an der Nahe, Weinsheim, Sponheim and Braunweiler, all of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. History Mandel (then Mannendal) had its first documentary mention in 962 as an Imperial fief of Saint Maximin's Abbey in Trier in a document purportedly from Emperor Otto I (although this document is known to be falsified). Given the job of V√∂gte over the holdings in Mandel by the abbey were the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves. A church, which may well have been consecrated to Saint Maximin himself, had its first documentary mention in 1140 in a document from Pope Innocent II. In 1196, independently from the abbey's holdings, Imperial ministerialis Werner von Bolanden was enfeoffed by the Empire with the jurisdiction, the right to appoint clergy and the tithes. Subsequently, split off from the jurisdiction, the right to appoint clergy and the tithes passed to the heirs of the Bolandens, the Counts of Sponheim-Dannenfels and the Princes of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken. The Counts of Sponheim enfeoffed their ministeriales with their share of the right to appoint clergy. In 1370, the fiefholder was the knight Sir Heinrich Zymar von Sponheim, called von Mannendal. Landholds in Mandel were also among the holdings made over to Sponheim Abbey in 1101 when the Counts endowed that institution. In 1439, the lordship over Mandel cropped up as a holding of the Family von Dalberg, who were the Chamberlains of Worms. They transferred the village as a fief to the Family von Koppenstein. This family had arisen from a liaison between Count Johann II of Sponheim-Kreuznach and the daughter of one of his Burgmannen, one not legitimized by wedlock. This Sponheim sideline named itself after their castle in the Hunsr√ºck, Koppenstein. They were in the service of various territorial lords over time, as knights, clergy or officials, even Obermarschall in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, and even under the Counts of Sponheim themselves. The Family von Koppenstein was split into two lines, the Kirchberg Line, which was Catholic, and the Mandel Line, which was Lutheran. The village of Mandel, however, was owned by all family members. The administrative seat ‚Äì and at times also the residential seat ‚Äì was the palace built by the von Koppensteins. Held in fief by the von Koppensteins from Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken was a half share of the tithe. About the middle of the 16th century, the Lutheran faith was introduced into the village. Several members of the Family von Koppenstein were buried in the old church. Bearing witness to this is Michael von Koppenstein's still preserved tomb slab from the 16th century. When Jacob Adolf von Koppenstein died in 1768 with no heir, the Family von Koppenstein was no more, and the village of Mandel passed back to the overlords, the Barons of Dalberg. In 1786, they sold the village, along with all the rights, to Imperial Count Carl-August von Bretzenheim. In 1801, with the Treaty of Lun√©ville, Mandel too, along with all the German lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank, was incorporated into the French state after having been overrun by French Revolutionary troops. From 1815, Mandel was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Prussian B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Mandel- H√ºffelsheim was named after it and one other village. Mandel remained Prussian right through Imperial, Weimar and Nazi times, only becoming part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate after the Second World War.History =Jewish history= Mandel had a Jewish community until sometime between 1938 and 1943. It arose sometime in the 18th century. The number of Jewish inhabitants in the 19th century developed as follows: in 1808, there were 25; in 1858, 75; in 1895, 48. From the mid-19th century, the Jews living in Weinsheim also belonged to the Jewish community in Mandel. In the way of institutions, there were a synagogue (see Synagogue below), a Jewish school (this was housed at the Jewish schoolhouse on Rathausstra√üe), a mikveh and a graveyard (see Jewish graveyard below). To provide for the community's religious needs, a schoolteacher was hired, who also busied himself as the hazzan and the shochet. An advertisement for homemade kosher wine for Passover in the magazine Der Israelit on 17 March 1884 referred to the community's ‚Äústrictly religious religion teacher‚Äù whose name was Mr. Eppstein. One member of Mandel's Jewish community fell in the First World War, Leo Michel (b. 17 October 1895 in Mandel, d. 27 August 1918). Also, a former Mandel resident who had moved to Kreuznach by 1914, Isaak Rauner (b. 30 April 1884 in Mandel, d. 9 April 1918) fell in the Great War. In 1925, the Jewish community still had 22 members. In 1932, the community's head was Emil Marx. In 1933, there were still 23 Jews living in Mandel. After 1933, the year when Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power, though, some of the Jews moved away or even emigrated in the face of the boycotting of their businesses, the progressive stripping of their rights and repression, all brought about by the Nazis. On Kristallnacht (9‚Äì10 November 1938), the synagogue's interior was utterly destroyed by Brownshirt thugs (their commander is believed to have been from Roxheim), and perhaps worse, several Jewish homes were also invaded and demolished (the Families Marx, Michel and Salomon). Some locals also eagerly participated in the destruction of Jewish property that night. Particularly bad was the effect on community head Marx's family (a butcher‚Äôs shop on Hauptstra√üe). Marx had been left lame in the right arm in the First World War (for which he had been awarded the Iron Cross, First Class); Mr. and Mrs. Marx had four children, two of whom (Karola and Ernst) were deaf and dumb. The Family Marx‚Äôs home and business were utterly destroyed. The parents and the two deaf children were later murdered after being deported. According to the Gedenkbuch ‚Äì Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933-1945 (‚ÄúMemorial Book ‚Äì Victims of the Persecution of the Jews under National Socialist Tyranny‚Äù) and Yad Vashem, of all Jews who either were born in Mandel or lived there for a long time, 17 died in the time of the Third Reich (birthdates in brackets): #Rosalie Dreifuss n√©e Rauner (1895) #Moses Hirsch (1882) #Otto Hirsch (1877) #Simon Hirsch (1875) #Jenny Kaufmann n√©e Hirsch (1880) #Bertha L√∂b n√©e Hirsch (1862) #Rosa L√∂b n√©e Hirsch (1857) #Emil Marx (1876) #Ernst Marx (1913) #Eugenie Marx n√©e Marx (1881) #Karola Marx (1910) #Rosa Marx (1873) #Berta Rauner (1886) #Moritz Salomon (1876) #Luise Schloss n√©e B√§rmann (1883) #Salomon Schloss (1878) #Siegbert SchlossJewish history Religion As at 31 October 2013, there are 896 full- time residents in Mandel, and of those, 500 are Evangelical (55.804%), 242 are Catholic (27.009%), 10 (1.116%) belong to other religious groups and 144 (16.071%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by personalized proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairwoman. The 12 seats are shared between two voters‚Äô groups.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Mandel's mayor is Peter Schulz, and her deputies are Marcus Baumberger Lars Birkigt.Mandel‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: Das Wappen zeigt ein Schachbrett mit blau-gelben Feldern, oben rechts ein goldenes Freifeld, darin ein Rabe auf zwei gr√ºnen Mandeln. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Chequy azure and Or a quarter of the second in which a raven standing on two almonds, all proper. At the wine festival in Mandel, the village was decked out with the municipal flag, giving rise to the question of what the coat of arms meant. The arms, approved by the now defunct Regierungsbezirk administration in 1959, is derived from the village's former court seal. This court seal in turn had its roots in the arms once borne by the former court lords of Mandel, the Lords of Koppenstein. Koppe is apparently a word that means \\"raven\\", which led the Koppensteins to adopt the raven as their heraldic device. In their arms, the raven charge stood on two mountaintops, but in Mandel's former court seal, these were changed to two almonds, almost certainly to serve as a canting charge, for Mandel also happens to be the German word for ‚Äúalmond‚Äù. Since the Koppensteins had sprung from an illegitimate connection with the Counts of Sponheim, they also bore the Sponheims‚Äô blue and gold ‚Äúchequy‚Äù pattern in their arms. The Koppensteins‚Äô arms are also part of those borne by the Verbandsgemeinde of R√ºdesheim. This stems from the old Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Mandel, a body that existed under Revolutionary and Napoleonic French rule, later the B√ºrgermeisterei (also ‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Mandel under Prussian rule, which, as a union of Mandel and H√ºffelsheim formed the basis of what later became the Verbandsgemeinde.Description and explanation of Mandel‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district * Evangelical church, Schlo√üstra√üe 16 ‚Äì Late Classicist aisleless church, 1829/1830, District Building Inspector Ludwig Behr, Bad Kreuznach * Saint Anthony's Catholic Church (Kirche St. Antonius), Kreuznacher Stra√üe 39 ‚Äì Romanesquified brick building, 1897, architect Lambert von Fisenne, after fire in 1948 reconstruction * Alte Rathausstra√üe 4 ‚Äì timber-frame house, plastered, marked 1594 * Alte Rathausstra√üe 17 ‚Äì former syrup factory; estate complex, 19th century; three-floor building with half-hip roof, marked 1815, essentially possibly older * Alte Rathausstra√üe 25 ‚Äì Baroque timber-frame house, partly solid, about 1700 * Schlo√üstra√üe 5 ‚Äì estate complex; Baroque building with half-hip roof, timber framing plastered, mid-18th century; cast-iron pump well * Schlo√üstra√üe 14 ‚Äì Evangelical rectory; Early Classicist building with hip roof, 1789‚Äì1791, Building Inspector Schweitzer, Kirchheimbolanden; Baroque barn * Schlo√üstra√üe 18 ‚Äì former castle (Schloss) of the Knights of Koppenstein; Renaissance building with stairway tower, marked 1624, ringwall remnants with shell towers; armorial stone 1722 * Sponheimer Stra√üe 1 ‚Äì estate complex; Baroque building with half-hip roof, timber-frame, partly solid, marked 1746 * Sponheimer Stra√üe 7 ‚Äì estate complex; Baroque timber-frame house, partly solid, 18th century, timber-frame barn, partly solid, gateway complex marked 1775 * Sponheimer Stra√üe 20, 22 ‚Äì Catholic and Evangelical schoolhouse; cube-shaped buildings with tent roofs, mid-19th century * At Zur alten Trift 1 ‚Äì inscription tablet, wooden, marked 1730 * Jewish Graveyard (monumental zone)Landkreis Bad Kreuznach: Inhaltsverzeichnis des Kreisrechtes, abgerufen am 31.

In the mid-19th century, a synagogue was built. It was made out of red sandstone and had several round-arch windows and corner lesenes. On Kristallnacht (9‚Äì10 November 1938), the synagogue's interior was heavily damaged by Brownshirt thugs, leaving little more than a shell of a building. In 1959/1960, what was left of the building was torn down. In 1932, the synagogue stood at Hauptstra√üe 62.Synagogue Jewish graveyard The Jewish graveyard (Judenkirchhof) in Mandel was laid out before 1821. There are an older graveyard with 43 graves recognizable as such and ‚Äì lying apart from this some 10 m away ‚Äì a newer graveyard with an area of only 25 m2 and three graves. The older part stands under monumental protection. The last burial at the newer part took place in 1933 (Julius Hirsch, d. 18 November 1933). The graveyard's area is 1 133 m2. It lies on a hill north of the village in the cadastral area known as ‚ÄúAuf dem Judenkirchhof‚Äù, field 5. From here there is a panoramic view of the village of Mandel.Jewish graveyard =Clubs= The following clubs are active in Mandel:Clubs *Bauern- und Winzerverband ‚Äî farmers‚Äô and winegrowers‚Äô association *Kirchliches Blasorchester ‚Äî church wind orchestra *Landfrauenverein ‚Äî countrywomen's club *MGV Edelwei√ü 1931 e.V. ‚Äî men's singing club *Spielplatzteam ‚Äî ‚Äúplayground team‚Äù *TuS Mandel 1901 e.V. ‚Äî gymnastic and sport club *VdK Ortsverein ‚Äî social advocacy group local chapter Economy and infrastructure =Wineries= Mandel's website lists five wineries (Weing√ºter) in the village:Wineries *Weingut Manfred & Gernot Bamberger *Weingut Arnold Baumberger *Weingut R√∂merhof Ralf Baumberger *Weingut Heinrich Br√ºck *Weingut Sonnenhof Michael Gr√§ff =Transport= Running through Mandel is Landesstra√üe 237. Meeting it in the village are Kreisstra√üen 50 (in the west end, at a four-way junction) and 52 (in the east end, at a three-way junction). Serving nearby Bad Kreuznach is a railway station with various connections. Branching off the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken) here is the railway line to Gau Algesheim. From Bingen am Rhein, Regionalbahn trains run by way of the Alsenz Valley Railway, which branches off the Nahe Valley Railway in Bad M√ºnster am Stein, to Kaiserslautern, reaching it in roughly 65 minutes. Running on the line to Saarbr√ºcken and by way of Gau Algesheim and the West Rhine Railway to Mainz are Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains. The travel time to Mainz lies between 25 and 40 minutes, and to Saarbr√ºcken between 1 hour and 40 minutes and 2 hours and 20 minutes. =Public institutions= Since 1986, Mandel has had the Schlossberghalle, a multipurpose hall. =Education= Beside the Schlossberghalle stands the municipal kindergarten. It opened in April 1971, has room for two groups and currently caters to 40 children.Education Further reading * Bodo Lipps: Entdeckungsreisen im Landkreis Bad Kreuznach.

Eventually he rose to be a full professor of private-sector economics at the University of Cologne in 1919. That same year he went to Berlin as the department head for questions relating to transition economics at the Imperial Ministry of Agriculture and also became a Secretary of State in the Imperial Ministry of Economics. In 1924 he began teaching at the Berlin Business College and beginning in 1926 was also honorary professor and leader of the Institute of Business Economics at that university, becoming in 1928 an honorary professor at the Business College and the College of Politics. In 1933 he was involuntarily retired because Jews were no longer welcome under the new Nazi r√©gime, and Hirsch emigrated by way of the Netherlands to Denmark, working there until 1940 as a professor at the Copenhagen Business School. Hitler‚Äôs forces then marched into Denmark and Hirsch was arrested. In 1941 he emigrated to the United States, teaching there at the New School for Social Research in New York until his death.

H. Friston) The Happy Land is a play with music written in 1873 by W. S. Gilbert (under the pseudonym F. Latour Tomline) and Gilbert Arthur √† Beckett. The musical play burlesques Gilbert's earlier play, The Wicked World. The blank verse piece opened at the Royal Court Theatre on 3 March 1873 and enjoyed a highly successful run, soon touring, and then being immediately revived at the same theatre in the autumn of 1873.Joseph S Meisel (1999), The Importance of Being Serious: The Unexplored Connection between Gladstone and Humour, History 84 (274), p. 278‚Äì300. Rees, Terence. \\"The Happy Land: its true and remarkable history\\" in W. S. Gilbert Society Journal vol. 1, no. 8 (1994), pp. 228‚Äì37 The play created a scandal by breaking regulations against the portrayal of public characters, parodying William Ewart Gladstone, Robert Lowe, and Acton Smee Ayrton, respectively the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and First Commissioner of Works. Three characters were made up and costumed to look like the caricatures of Gladstone, Lowe and Ayrton that had appeared in Vanity Fair. The scandal was great enough to be included in the Annual Register's \\"Chronicle of Remarkable Occurrences.\\" The play was censored by Britain's Lord Chamberlain, which ironically caused it to become unusually popular. The Happy Land also anticipated some of the themes in the political satire seen in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including unqualified people in positions of authority, like Sir Joseph in H.M.S. Pinafore, selecting government by \\"competitive examination\\" as in Iolanthe, and especially the importation of English exemplars to \\"improve\\" a naive civilisation, as in Utopia, Limited. Background W.S. Gilbert in about 1870 The year before the play opened, Gilbert told The Era, \\"As I consider that I am quite as well qualified to judge of what is fit for the ears of a theatrical audience as [the Licenser of Plays] can be, I have systematically declined to take the slightest notice of his instructions\\".Stedman, pp. 106‚Äì07 The Happy Land is a blank verse musical burlesque of Gilbert's earlier play, The Wicked World. The plot roughly follows that of The Wicked World, with the disastrous powers of love replaced with the disaster of \\"popular government\\". As in The Wicked World and several other Gilbert works, the play concerns chaos that is wreaked in Fairyland when an element of life in the mortal world is imported.Introduction to Broken Hearts at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 11 March 2009 In The Wicked World, this element is \\"mortal love\\", while in The Happy Land, it is \\"popular government\\", which is delivered to Fairyland by Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton. Stedman calls this a \\"Gilbertian invasion plot\\".Stedman, p. 95: In \\"a Gilbertian invasion\\" plot, outsiders change a given society, as where the Thespians take control of Olympus in Thespis, and the Flowers of Progress remodel Utopia in Utopia, Limited. The three men depicted, and clearly identified by their make-up and by costumes designed after contemporary cartoons in Vanity Fair, were, respectively, Britain's Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer and First Commissioner of Works. The three characters were described in the cast list as Mr. G., Mr. L., and Mr. A. Gladstone's government is portrayed as mean and uncaring of Britain's national interests, degrading British prestige abroad. The three men are seen to lack substance and taste.Lawrence, p. 162. The daring political attack was almost unprecedented on the English stage. The opening night response was described by Edward Righton, who played \\"Mr. A.\\": :\\"[As we] appeared, rising through the clouds, there burst upon us another gale of boisterous merriment, which increased and increased in volume as we rose higher and higher, until the three figures from Vanity Fair stood on the stage; then the applause resembled the roaring of cannon or claps of thunder.\\"Article on the background of the play, by Andrew Crowther, at the G&S; Archive The Prince of Wales, attended the play on its opening night at the Court Theatre on 3 March 1873. Appalled at this attack on the government of which his mother the Queen was the titular head, he notified Lord Sydney, the Lord Chamberlain and Britain's official censor at the time, about the nature of the play. Three days later, on 6 March, the Lord Chamberlain revoked the play's performance licence, while a public inquiry was begun. This found that \\"the piece licensed and the piece acted were virtually different productions, unwarrantable alterations and enlargements having been introduced at the rehearsals, which the Lord Chamberlain would never have authorised.\\"The Illustrated London News, 15 March 1873, p, 243 Comparing the licensed copy, which he had approved, with the prompt copy, which was performed, the Lord Chamberlain claimed in a Memorandum that \\"in the prompter's copy there were eighteen quarto pages of additions, interpolations, and deviations from the original licensed text; and that in the original [manuscript] there was no indication whatsoever to point the allusions to individuals.... The manager expressed regret at what had occurred, and begged that the piece might be allowed to be performed as originally licensed, promising to adhere verbatim to the text, and to avoid anything which should convert the general allusions into personalities\\" including the make up of the actors. The theatre was only dark for two or three nights before the play was allowed to reopen.Review of the play in The Sentinel, 1873 However, Marie Litton, the theatre's manager, claimed that the eighteen pages were merely the number that contained a modification of some sort, and that she believed it was acceptable as it was being done elsewhere. She also published the script as it was originally performed ‚Äì with the cut sections written in all capital letters, and posted a notice that read: Righton, Hill and Fisher parodying Ayrton, Lowe and Gladstone :Notice. ‚Äì The Happy Land. ‚Äì Miss Litton begs to inform the public that the Lord Chamberlain has forbidden Messrs. Fisher, Hill, and Righton to make up their faces in imitation of Messrs. Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton. ‚Äì Royal Court Theatre, 6 March. The scandal, which was great enough to be included in the Annual Register's \\"Chronicle of Remarkable Occurrences\\", generated widespread publicity for the play, and, even without the makeup, everyone knew who was really being portrayed. In fact, wrote The Times, \\"the Lord Chamberlain has proved a mighty instructor ... everybody perfectly knows whom [the three actors] are intended to represent, and every line they utter is the signal for an approving roar.\\"The Times, 19 March 1873 The critics mostly praised the piece, although papers disagreed on whether or not the stage should be more subject to censorship than the press.Lawrence, pp. 172‚Äì73 and 176‚Äì78 For instance, The Manchester Guardian wrote that the satire made \\"Many a brilliant sally at the supposed short-comings of the present government.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 8 March 1873 Meanwhile, Gilbert was having some trouble keeping up the pseudonym. Shirley Brooks may have thought F. Tomline was Henry Labouch√®re, but reviewers and others were beginning to link him with Gilbert.Lawrence, p. 161 Worse, Gilbert's friend and collaborator Frederic Clay began vigorously defending him against the absolutely true allegations, forcing Gilbert to quietly take him into his confidence. The Athenaeum commented that the play was \\"written with such talent, and catching very well the very spirit of Mr. Gilbert's manner and method that we cannot but suspect that the interest of Mr. Gilbert in it has not stopped with mere superintendence of stage management, as announced.\\"The Athenaeum, 8 March 1873, p. 351 The play became one of the big hits of the season, running for 142 performances until the theatre closed for summer renovations on 9 August 1873. It then enjoyed a lengthy provincial tour and being immediately revived when the theatre reopened on 14 October 1873. However, for the Lord Chamberlain, the whole affair was a fiasco. His action \\"raised the question of censorship of the stage in an acute form\\" and questions about why only the stage should be subject to censorship began to be asked in quarters beyond the theatre: one parliamentarian, Sir Lawrence Palk, MP for East Devon threatened to bring it up in the House of Commons, and some suggested that the Lord Chamberlain was demonstrating political bias in his censorship of the play. One historian wrote that the play: > revealed in a clear and popular form the conservative Tory anguish as the > balance of political power tilted away from the aristocracy, and land > owners, and the upper middle class, and toward the lower middle class and > the workers. Gilbert, in his topsy-turvy manner, stigmatized the ethics and > morality of popular government, as the Liberal program was called, and > predicted the dire consequences for England of this innovation. Governmental > wisdom and virtue could rise no higher than their source, and under popular > government the source was the new electorate, motivated by profit, greed, > and the crude desires of the mob. At home the quality of British life would > sink to the level of the cheap and nasty, and abroad, good-bye to national > honor. England under the Liberals was on the way to becoming a second rate > power, at the mercy of its mightier neighbors across the channel. According > to Gilbert, this was the gloomy outlook for Great Britain under popular > government, and it reflected, as the critical reception of The Happy Land > showed, a large body of contemporary opinion.Lawrence, pp. 161‚Äì62 Gilbert returned to the West End later that year with a new play, The Realm of Joy, set in the lobby of a theatre performing The Happy Land, which rehashed aspects of the scandal, even going so far as to attack the Lord Chamberlain himself, referring to him as \\"The Lord High Disinfectant\\". The whole affair had proved such a political liability for the Lord Chamberlain, however, that he had no choice but to order The Realm of Joy to be licensed, with only the \\"usual changes\\".Stedman, pp. 109‚Äì10 Nevertheless, Gilbert never again directed his satire against specific persons: rather, he aimed his \\"hose of common sense\\" at types, such as Sir Joseph in H.M.S. Pinafore, the Major-General in The Pirates of Penzance and Ko-Ko in The Mikado, who are incompetent persons that have risen to a high government position.Lawrence, p. 179Smith, Steve. \\"All Hands on Deck for Absurd Relevance\\", The New York Times, 9 June 2008 In later years, Gilbert appears to have become ashamed of the subversive tone of The Happy Land: in 1909, testifying to a joint committee on stage censorship, he said that his \\"maturer judgement\\" on the play was that the Lord Chamberlain's \\"interference was absolutely justified\\". page 112 It was not until 1968, that the power of the Lord Chamberlain to censor plays was revoked.Lawrence, p. 178 Roles and original cast ;Male Fairies *Ethais ‚Äì Walter H.

Synopsis ;Act I The fairies live in a lavish and art- filled Fairyland, floating on a cloud overlooking the mortal world. Three male fairies, Ethais, Phylion and Lutin, relate to the female fairies their \\"detestation\\" at their experiences below, in the \\"wicked\\" world. However, they note the conveniences of Victorian civilisation. The female fairies suspect that the males may not hate the mortal world as much as they say, and complain of the dullness of life in Fairyland, and long to experience that wonderful, wicked world. Selene, the Fairy Queen, expresses a determination to go to Earth. The three males resist this and instead agree to return to the world themselves and ask the Fairy King (who is in England studying \\"political economy\\", also known as \\"spending a pound to save a penny\\") to send three mortals up to Fairyland, so that the fairies may find out what men are really like. While the female fairies wait for the three mortals, Selene explains why England has an advantage over other countries: it enjoys a \\"popular government\\". The three mortal statesmen arrive ‚Äì Mr. G., Mr. L. and Mr. A ‚Äì declaring, \\"Oh, we are three most popular men! We want to know who'll turn us out!\\" At first, Fairyland is not to their liking, as it is decorated with \\"ridiculous extravagance\\", but they change their minds as soon as they find themselves surrounded by the female fairies. The women are charmed by the mortals' oratorical virtuosity. At the fairies' request, they explain how \\"popular government\\" works. The fairies decide to introduce popular government into Fairyland. The fairies are divided into Government and Opposition, and the members of the Opposition are sent away grumbling. Then, ministerial posts are allocated after a competitive examination in which those who show that they are the least fitted for the particular duties are appointed to fill them. For example, the fairy who asks what a ship may be is appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. All the fairies want to be Prime Minister, but, following precedent, Selene is so appointed. ;Act II The fairies' experiment in \\"popular government\\" is a disaster. Penny-pinching and shabbiness rule the state, the military is in disarray, and the Chinese may soon invade. Leila and the other Opposition fairies revolt, and all the Government ministers resign. Selene appeals to Mr. A., who suggests that \\"patriotism is the ladder by which the rising statesman ascends to the pinnacle of place,\\" and \\"place is the pinnacle seated upon which the risen statesman kicks away the ladder of patriotism.\\" Selene replies, \\"Sisters, I've done with office, give me a peerage and let me end my days in respectability and peace.\\" Mr. G. advises that even in this situation, she should not consider resigning or apologising; but Selene ultimately rejects this, although she has feelings for Mr. G. The three mortal honourables return to earth, as they must attend a cabinet meeting. When the fairies realise that the mortals were corrupt, they exclaim, \\"How shabby!\\" Soon the three male fairies return with news from the Fairy King: they may enjoy the privilege of \\"popular government.\\" Selene rejects this with horror. The fairies will \\"Leave such blessings to a happy land.\\" Musical numbers ;Act I *Opening Duo and Chorus (Zayda, Darine and Chorus) ‚Äì \\"Lullaby Fairyland\\" *Trio (Ethais, Phyllon and Lutin) ‚Äì \\"We are three unhappy fairies\\" *Quintette and Chorus (Zayda, Darine, Ethais, Phyllon and Lutin) ‚Äì \\"Send us up from yonder wicked den\\" *Trio (Mr. G., Mr. L., Mr. A.) ‚Äì \\"We are three statesmen old and tried\\" *Finale ‚Äì \\"By playing loose and fast\\" ; Act II *Ensemble ‚Äì \\"When every single art you've tried\\" *Finale ‚Äì \\"Our little feet we never show\\" Antecedents and development of Gilbertian satire Gilbert created several blank verse \\"fairy comedies\\" at the Haymarket Theatre in the early 1870s beginning with The Palace of Truth (1870) and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871). The Wicked World was the third of these, and The Happy Land followed so soon on its heels that the two plays ran simultaneously. The plot of The Happy Land and The Wicked World clearly fascinated Gilbert. Not only had he written a short story on the theme in 1871, but he returned to it in his 1909 comic opera, Fallen Fairies. Indeed, the general theme of mortals disturbing the peaceful state of affairs in fairyland is featured in a number of other Gilbert works, including the Gilbert and Sullivan opera Iolanthe (1882).Article on Broken Hearts from the G&S; Archive Gilbert followed The Happy Land with The Realm of Joy, set in the lobby of a theatre performing a thinly-disguised The Happy Land, which directly parodies the scandal, even describing the costumes used.See Terence Rees's introduction to Gilbert, W. S., The Realm of Joy, and Stedman, pp. 108‚Äì09. Note that the titles, The Realm of Joy (used as the name of the play-within-a-play in the latter piece) and The Happy Land are roughly synonymous. In The Happy Land, The Realm of Joy (1873) and Charity (1874), Gilbert stretched the boundaries of how far social commentary could go in the Victorian theatre. The Realm of Joy poked many jokes at the Lord Chamberlain.Crowther, Andrew, Synopsis of The Realm of Joy and Terence Rees' introduction to Gilbert, W. S., The Realm of Joy Charity critiqued the contrasting ways in which Victorian society treated men and women who had sex outside of marriage, which anticipated the 'problem plays' of Shaw and Ibsen.Crowther, Andrew. Synopsis of Charity The Happy Land is an example of Gilbert's \\"repeated ridicule of idealistic panaceas for curing social ills [among which was] Gilbert's conception of popular government as an imprac- tical theory. In the operas these schemes range from the notion that \\"true love [is] the source of every earthly joy,\\" in The Sorcerer; through the prescription of \\"Republican [equality]\\" as a remedy for social ills in The Gondoliers; to the systematic plan for political and social reforms brought from England by the Flowers of Progress for the benefit, and ultimate corruption, of the south sea island kingdom of Utopia in Utopia Limited\\" and its salvation through the institution of party politics.Lawrence, p. 180‚Äì82 Notes References * Gilbert, W.

LACE was initially located in the same area on Broadway, later moving to an industrial neighborhood near the Los Angeles River, and finally to Hollywood. Founded in 1978 by a group of thirteen artists and based upon principles of grassroots community organizing and social change, LACE committed from the start to presenting experimental works of art in all media, including the then-experimental media of performance art and video. LACE provided an early venue for artists like Laurie Anderson, Nancy Buchanan, Chris Burden, Gronk, Ishmael Houston-Jones, Mike Kelley, Martin Kersels, Linda Nishio, Paper Tiger TV, Adrian Piper, Judith Simonian, Johanna Went, David Wojnarowicz, Bruce and Norman Yonemoto, and Liz Young. The presence of performance art and video in major museums suggest that these experimental media are now part of the artistic canon and testifies to the success of LACE to promote these media to a wider audience. Originally located in Downtown Los Angeles, LACE moved to Hollywood in 1994. LACE has partnered with various organizations like YMCA, the Los Angeles LGBT Center, My Friend's Place, and Woodbury University. LACE also partners with other organizations including the Getty Museum, the Fellows of Contemporary Art, the California Institute of the Arts, the California College of the Arts in Oakland, Washington University in St. Louis, Kent State University, Atlanta College of Art, and Contemporary Art Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1998, LACE inaugurated Contemporary Editions LA, a fine-art publishing venture featuring Los Angeles-based artists, with editions in its first year by Paul McCarthy, Martin Kersels, and Sharon Lockhart. The following year, space published three new editions by artists Kevin Appel, Evan Holloway, and James Welling.

Winton is to the east of Wallisdown, Victoria Park and Talbot Woods and south of Moordown. History The name Winton was derived from Wintoun Castle in Scotland, which was home to the Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, a relative of the Talbot family: landowners who started the development of Winton. At the beginning of the 19th century the area was just rough heathland, with just a track linking ancient Moordown Village to Horseshoe Common. In 1805 this all changed when a new main road through Winton was put in and named Muscliff Road (today it is known as Wimborne Road). Around 1850 wealthy Scottish philanthropists Georgina and Marianne Talbot saw the plight of local workers and set about trying to improve their lives by purchasing land along the road and building four artisan cottages and sinking wells to provide fresh water. They founded Talbot Village. By 1891 the population of Winton had reached 4,000 and by 1894 the needs of Winton were so great that they were put under the care of the Winton Parish Council and later in 1897 Winton Urban District Council was formed. In 1901 Bournemouth (which was by then a county borough) increased its boundaries to include Winton and other districts. Landmarks & Buildings =Winton Recreation Ground= Winton Rec pavilion. Winton Recreation Ground is the only significant green space in an area of approximately one square mile, serving a population of 4750 people. The idea of creating a public recreation facility for Winton was first envisaged in 1902. The Earl of Malmesbury gave nearly six hectares of suitable land to Bournemouth Borough Council in 1904. The official opening of Winton Recreation Ground took place in September 1906. The facilities available at the ground include Richmond Park Bowls Club, tennis courts, cycle track, children's playground, playgroups play building and a cricket pitch. The cricket pavilion is over 90 years old and it was extended in 1962 and refurbished in 1999. Winton Banks. =Winton Banks= This busy road junction in Winton is called Winton Banks thanks to the many banks that surrounded this junction. =Continental Cinema= The picture (right) is close to where the Continental Cinema once stood. Opened in 1911 it started life as the Winton Hall and was renamed Winton Electric Picture House the following year. In 1930 it was modernised and renamed Plaza, becoming the first cinema in Bournemouth to show talking pictures. After the war years it was again refurbished and renamed the Continental. In 1978 it changed hands but the cinema took a downturn in the 1980s due to lack of maintenance and it ended its life in 1989 when it was demolished to build a pub. =Peter's Hill= The steep rise in Wimborne Road to the north of Kemp and Wycliffe roads, has been known locally for many years as Peter's Hill, with several stories circulating as to the origin of the name, the least fanciful would seem to be that the spire of Saint Peter's Church in Bournemouth could be glimpsed from the top of the hill. Evidence of the name dates to 1871, soon after Winton was formed, when Henry Vatcher a carter living with his wife two children and two lodgers, gives Peter's Hill as his address on the census. =Winton Library= Winton library. Winton library was opened in 1907 and became Bournemouth's first permanent purpose-built library. It was built on land provided by landowner Lord Leven with financial support from Scottish-American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. It was one of the first public libraries in the country to allow open access to the shelves; and it was here that Flora Thompson read the literature on which she based her literary career culminating in her autobiographical trilogy Lark Rise to Candleford. The library has undergone a number of refurbishments during its lifetime, the most recent in 2006 when a computer suite was added. Present day Today Winton is still popular for shopping, including a regular farmers' market which takes place in Cardigan Road. The area has several striking buildings, such as Saint Luke‚Äôs Church, the old Fire Station on Peter‚Äôs Hill, what was the art-deco Moderne Cinema building, now known as the Lifecentre, having undergone a complete refurbishment maintaining the art-deco theme.

Winton is also a popular area for students of Bournemouth University and The Arts University Bournemouth to live in, given its local amenities, bus connections to the town centre and proximity to Talbot Campus, the university's main site and the AUB campus.

It was built in the 14th century (possibly in 1331), during the Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368) and was expanded in 1748. The temple, which is built on six different levels over an elevation of nearly 100 meters, is known for its fine scenery. The temple also includes the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, which is located at the center of the temple complex. Two other prominent features are the Arhats Hall and the Vajrasana Pagoda. Inside Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall lies an empty crystal coffin presented by the Soviet government in 1925 in memory of Sun Yat-sen (his body had already been entombed and placed at the temple pagoda until its relocation to Nanjing in 1929). Photos of Sun Yat-sen, his handwriting, books and statue are also on display on two sides. There are 512 statues, which include 500 wooden Arhats, 11 Bodhisattvas and one statue of Ji Gong (a famous Buddhist monk) inside the Hall of Arhats. All the Arhats are vivid, life-size statues with different poses and expressions. It has been said that two of these Arhats were the statues of the Kangxi Emperor and the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911). In addition to these life-sized images, there is a miniature statue of Ji Gong perched on an overhead beam.

This autobiographical film was her directorial debut, and it won the Prix Louis- Delluc. The high school where the film takes place is the Lyc√©e Jules-Ferry in Paris, France.  Plot  In the year 1963, 13-year-old Anne and 15-year-old Frederique are two Jewish sisters whose parents are separated. They live in Paris with their mother and spend their summer holidays at the beach with their father, around whom they both feel awkward. They attend a strict school. Anne, who is on the threshold of adolescence, is anti-social (or at least asocial) and not much of an achiever. She tries to find out what is going on around her by eavesdropping on her mother and her sister. Her school grades are poor and indeed substandard, and she has to deal with unfair teachers; on one occasion, she is caught plagiarising an essay her sister had written a year before. She also has her first period and is learning to talk to boys, and to sort things out with her mother after getting in trouble. By contrast, Frederique is much more outgoing, and she is starting to become politically involved, especially in the Algerian question and banning the bomb. She has a crush on someone much older than herself, and is beginning to feel the first serious pangs of love. She also experiences her first friend who runs away, and her first loss of friendship over values.  Cast  *El√©onore Klarwein as Anne *Odile Michel as Frederique *Anouk Ferjac as Mme.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bad Sobernheim, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= Rehbach lies on the south slope of a 400 m-high hill of the Soonwald. The village is surrounded by fields, meadows and cropfields. The nearest big towns are Bad Kreuznach to the east, Simmern to the northwest and Bad Sobernheim to the south. Until 1972, however, the village of Rehbach lay in a different place, several hundred metres to the north. It was moved to escape the noise and danger from the nearby Pferdsfeld airbase. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Rehbach's neighbours are the municipalities of Winterburg, Bockenau and Daubach, the town of Bad Sobernheim and the municipality of Ippenschied, all of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. Although Rehbach borders on ‚ÄúBad Sobernheim‚Äù, this is actually an outlying section of the town's municipal area, geographically separate from the part where the actual townsite is found. The town of Bad Sobernheim annexed the area after the residents moved to the town and asked for their former municipalities to be amalgamated after noise, and potential physical danger, from the Pferdsfeld airbase made their villages uninhabitable. The municipality on which Rehbach formerly bordered just here was called Eckweiler. History Eckweiler was not the only village whose existence was affected by noise and the ever-present threat of military aircraft crashes from the Pferdsfeld airbase, which until about 1960 was a NATO facility used by the United States Air Force, and thereafter until 1997 a Bundeswehr base known as Fliegerhorst Pferdsfeld. Rehbach, too, forsook its original site and the whole village moved to a new one by 1972, although Rehbach retained its municipal autonomy, and even moved some of its old buildings to the new site, still within its traditional municipal area. The new village was dedicated on 25 June 1971 and the old one was subsequently levelled. All that was left standing was the graveyard (a photograph of which can be seen here) and the limetree at the old village fountain. A memorial stone at the old village site, a boulder from the Soonwald, unveiled on 1 June 1980, commemorates Rehbach's 500 years of history there. The inscription reads ‚Äú500 Jahre Rehbach ‚Äì Einebnung 1972 ‚Äì Verweile ‚Äì Gedenke‚Äù (‚Äú500 years Rehbach ‚Äì Levelling 1972 ‚Äì Linger ‚Äì Remember‚Äù; a photograph of the memorial stone can be seen here). Both the belltower from the old village hall and the village fountain, being considered the village's foremost landmarks, were moved to the new site in November 1972 and festively rededicated. After the airfield at nearby Pferdsfeld was given up by the military in 1998, the municipality of Rehbach, together with the town of Bad Sobernheim (within whose limits the airbase lay after the acquisition of the outlying villages) and the municipality of Ippenschied founded the Planungsverband Konversionsma√ünahmen Pferdsfeld, a group whose goal was to convert the facility to civilian use. A community centre with a youth room, a slaughterhouse and firefighting facilities arose, new houses were built and in 1970 the first villagers moved in.History Religion As at 2 January 2014, there are 48 full-time residents in Rehbach, and of those, 36 are Evangelical (75%), 2 are Catholic (4.167%), and 10 (20.883%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Rehbach's mayor is Reinhold Kessel.Rehbach‚Äôs mayor =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: In Rot ein blauer Wellenbalken, belegt mit einem silbernen, goldgeh√∂rnten Rehbock. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Gules a fess wavy azure surmounted by a roebuck springing argent attired Or. Rehbach bears canting arms, meaning that the charges in the arms suggest the village's name. The animal charge is a roebuck, or Rehbock in German, while Reh is the word for ‚Äúroe deer‚Äù, and the wavy blue fess (horizontal stripe) symbolizes a brook, or Bach in German. Thus Reh + Bach makes the arms a rebus for the name ‚ÄúRehbach‚Äù. Culture and sightseeing =Clubs= Worth mentioning is the riding club with roughly 250 members (as against the village's total population of 48). It is mainly riders from Rehbach and the surrounding area who indulge in their great hobby here. With its two outdoor pens and a big riding hall, the riding complex is one of the region's biggest. There is also training here in dressage and show jumping.Clubs Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Rehbach lies on Kreisstra√üe 23. This leads southwards to neighbouring Daubach (several hundred metres), linking with Kreisstra√üe 22, which itself links with Kreisstra√üe 20, which runs southwards to Bundesstra√üe 41 at Bad Sobernheim, serving which is a railway station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken). Bundesstra√üe 50 can also be reached over Landesstra√üe 108, which is linked to the municipality by Kreisstra√üe 24. =Public institutions= Rehbach shares a volunteer fire brigade with neighbouring Daubach.

The park was established in 1982. Park activities include cave tours, camping, fishing, hiking, picnicking, and swimming. History In 1850, the area was settled by George and Statirah Cresswell, who moved to the region from Washington County, Missouri with Statirah's adopted family, the Allisons. The family built a mill on the Meramec River near Saranac Springs.When a large flood destroyed Cresswell's mill in 1881, the property was purchased by William Henry Rollision Davis. A new mill was built on the property further away from the river at Davis Spring (now Onondaga Spring). In 1886, while studying the outlet of the spring that powered the new mill, a local resident by the name of Charles Christopher discovered that a cave existed behind the spring. With a borrowed boat and two of his friends (John Eaton and Mitis Horine), Christopher entered the cavern and spent an entire day exploring the tunnels within the property. Inspired by their adventure, Christopher and Eaton acquired the land over the cave and began developing their discovery as the \\"Mammoth Cave of Missouri\\", spawning a property dispute with Davis that lasted more than fifty years. At the time, \\"cave onyx\\" was in demand for architecture, and many caves in the area were being harvested for this purpose. Funds for development of the cave was something neither Christopher or Eaton could spare. Unable to decide whether to continue the cave as a mine or as a tourist destination, the pair had the cave surveyed in 1897 for mining but also gave tours to make the money needed to develop the caverns further. Arthur Hitch, one of the first tourists in the cave system, released a publication about the cave using Eaton's own flash-powder photographs. In 1899, Davis died and his property was sold (against the wishes of his widow, Artressia Davis) to a St. Louis group owned by George Bothe, Sr. In 1902, over 15 years after their discovery, Eaton gave up on the cavern and sold his holdings to the Indian Creek Land Company in the care of Eugene Hunt Benoist. Upset about this turn of events, Christopher in turn sold his portion of the holdings to the Bothe group. Bothe and Philip Franck formed a company with the intention of mining the cavern, and some test mining was performed. The cavern's difficult access and a drop in interest in cave onyx made this venture a fruitless endeavor. The cave was opened as a tourist attraction for the upcoming Louisiana Purchase Exposition planned in St. Louis for 1904. The name for the cavern system was chosen in 1904 by Myrtle Land, and was named for an Iroquois tribe. The translation of Onondaga is \\"People of the Mountain.\\" In 1910, the property owned by Bothe was sold to his niece, Catharine Weinborg, who in turn leased the property to Bob Bradford in 1913. Bradford eventually bought the cave property from Weinborg, but property disputes with Artressia Davis continued. In 1930, this dispute became a three- way struggle over the land when Dr. William Mook (who leased the Indian Creek Land Company property from Benoist in 1913) discovered that about half of Onondaga Cave was under his land. This discovery came from Ed Houser and Edward Myers, and with the help of Robert Lee Mook (Dr. Mook's brother), a tunnel was dug into Onondaga Cave and a fence was erected where the supposed property line existed. Their half of the cave became known as Missouri Caverns, with Robert Lee Mook as the manager. Another problem for Onondaga came from the commercial opening of the nearby Cathedral Cave (owned by Timmerman Nielson and managed by Al Keber). In 1932, Missouri Caverns was opened as the first electrically lit cave in the Missouri Ozarks region. Though the entrance is now sealed, the ruins of the buildings over the entrance still exist not far from the current visitor parking area. Onondaga now had competition on two fronts from both Cathedral Cave and from the back portion of itself under the name Missouri Caverns. The court battles continued over the land disputes, and Onondaga suffered due to its more distant position from US 66 on State Road H, as compared to the closer Missouri Caverns. A column formation known as the \\"Rock of Ages\\" A situation occurred that mirrored the land disputes in 1934 when senatorial candidate Harry S. Truman and members of his Democratic party had a planned visit to Missouri Caverns. The Republican Party members had arrived for a tour of Onondaga Cave, and the two parties met at the fence separating the caves. There, beneath the heavily disputed properties, the two parties engaged in a political debate through the fence. In November 1934, Dr. Mook died. Six months later, in May 1935, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Mooks and the Indian Creek Land Company. Bradford was not deterred by this turn of events, however, and continued to push for Onondaga's success. In 1937 (now in his seventies), Bradford built a motel at the mouth of the cave, known as the Cool Room, as the building's temperature was regulated by the cavern's consistently cool air. A new entrance to Onondaga was dug out by Bradford in 1938 (the entrance currently used when entering and exiting the cave). Until this time, tourists entered and left the cavern by boat. Now the tour could be routed so that tourists entered through the original boat entrance and exited by foot through the new entrance. During this same time, Robert Lee Mook was experiencing legal problems. Dr. William Mook's other heirs (who ran the Barnard Hospital in St. Louis) owned shares in the estate, and he attempted to sue them after they had loaned money to Bradford for improvements on Onondaga Cave. Missouri Caverns closed not long afterward because these legal problems as well as decreased interest in tourism during the two World Wars. Cathedral Cave also closed because of the decrease in tourism, and Onondaga's own future was uncertain after the death of Bradford. Artressia Davis, now 95, died after several unsuccessful attempts to sue the proprietors of both the Missouri Caverns and Onondaga Cave in 1943. In 1945, Bradford's widow, Mary Bradford, sold Onondaga to the Barnard Hospital. For the first time since its discovery, Onondaga now had only one owner. A director of the hospital, Charles Rice, took control of the now-joint caverns as well as Cathedral Cave and, free of the financial and legal problems that had plagued the caves since their discovery, began to further develop them under the management of Al Bryan. The electrification of the rural area of the state allowed the entire cave to be wired for lighting, and the old tour paths were replaced with new trails, stairs, and bridges. These improvements continued after Rice's death in 1949. In 1953, the property was sold to Lester B. Dill and Lyman Riley. The boat trips were discontinued because of safety concerns, but the docks inside of the cavern were kept and can still be seen today, along with a replica of the boats used for entering the cave. Dill had been in the business of caverns from a young age and had operated both the Fisher and Mushroom caves at Meramec State Park. He had also been responsible for the developing of the Saltpeter Cave into the now heavily commercialized Meramec Caverns. Riley, a retired teacher, had worked at both Meramec Caverns and Onondaga Cave. This began a time of prosperity for the caverns, with Riley and Dill making appearances on television game shows. Celebrities were invited to visit the caverns, stories were written about the caverns, and an advertising campaign began in all forms of media. Also, in 1954, Riley became an ordained minister and is reputed to have held church services and performed wedding ceremonies in the cave. Riley sold his shares of the cavern to Dill in 1967 when he retired from the business to pursue his religious interests. Now back to one owner, the 1970s would once again cause Onondaga to be the source of a property dispute. = Meramec Basin Project = Meramec River at Onondaga Cave State Park The U.S. Congress had approved the building of a dam near Pacific, Missouri in 1938 to help control the flooding of the Meramec River, which had devastated the lower river basin in 1915 and 1944. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed relocating the dam upstream at Meramec State Park in 1943. Riley had spoken in favor of the dam in 1949, believing this would bring additional tourism to the area. An iteration of this plan was authorized by Congress in 1967 as the Meramec Park Lake Project, which included the dam at Meramec as well as 30 others along the Meramec, Bourbeuse, and Big rivers. Would-be extent of Meramec Park Lake Opposition to the dam began in the 1960s from both local and nearby St. Louis area residents. Local farmland was taken by market price condemnation. Recreationists from the city believed it would have severe impacts on environmental, economic, and engineering concerns, and the value of the Meramec as a free-flowing canoe navigable stream. Construction industry officials, local politicians, and developers saw the prospect of great economic prosperity with a major lake only one hour from St. Louis. Dill was first pro-dam, thinking he would run glass-bottomed boats in the cave, but he joined the opposition when a survey of the cave showed that the dam near Sullivan would back upstream into the cave, and flood 80% of the cave when the lake was at normal pool. As this controversy raged Dill reopened Cathedral Cave, another cave on the property 1 times as long as Onondaga, under the name Missouri Caverns. New trails and lights were installed in the cave, and a large column formation within the cave was renamed the Liberty Bell in honor of the 1976 Bicentennial. The cave was closed soon after the defeat of the dam project in 1978. For several years it was subject to vandalism and theft that destroyed the lighting and visitor building. In 1978 a public referendum on the dam project was held, on August 8, in the 12 eastern Missouri counties affected by the Meramec Park Lake Project, and 64% of the voters opposed the building of the dam. Congressmen who previously supported the dam took note of the vote and voted to deauthorize the project, the only such case in the country where citizens stopped an Army Corps dam already under construction. Ronald Reagan signed the deauthorization bill on December 19, 1981, one and a half years after the death of Dill on August 13, 1980. It was Dill's wish that the state be given the right of first refusal on the sale of the Onondaga property. With cooperation from his survivors and assistance of the Nature Conservancy the state legislature met the Dill family's request, and Onondaga became a state park dedicated to Lester B. Dill. Officially dedicated in 1982, the cave was also designated as National Natural Landmark. In 1986 a large celebration was held in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the cave's discovery. Under the management of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources' Division of State Parks, Onondaga Cave is now in its second century and secure from further land disputes and vandalism. A new visitor's center and the nature museum were erected in 1990.  Vilander Bluff Natural Area  Vilander Bluffs with ancient Juniperus virginiana cedars The Vilander Bluff Natural Area is a unit of the state park that is located at northeast of the main body of the park. Its eponymous cliffs harbor unique natural communities, most notably a dry dolomite cliff community with over 200 ancient red cedar trees (Juniperus virginiana) that range in age from 200 to 500 years. The unit straddles the Meramec River, and opposite the bluffs is a rookery containing over 40 nests of the great blue heron.

(SR 153, named the Methow Valley Highway) is a long state highway in the U.S. state of Washington, serving as part of the Cascade Loop in Okanogan County. The Methow Valley Highway begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 97 (US 97) in Pateros at the confluence of the Methow River and the Columbia River. SR 153 travels northwest, parallel to the Methow River, to end at SR 20 south of Twisp. The highway was first established in 1897 as the Methow-Barron Road and was designated as various highways, including State Road 12 from 1905 to 1919, the Roosevelt Highway from 1919 to 1923, and Primary State Highway 16 (PSH 16) until the 1964 highway renumbering, when it became SR 153\\\\. Route description SR 153, part of the Cascade Loop, begins at an intersection with US 97 south of the confluence of the Methow River into the Columbia River in Pateros. The highway dips south before leaving Pateros into farmland and serving Alta Lake State Park to the south near the Chelan National Forest. SR 153 crosses the Methow River twice heading west towards the Sawtooth Ridge and turns north to the communities of Methow and Carlton. The highway continues northwest, ending at an intersection with SR 20 southeast of Twisp and Twisp Municipal Airport. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 1,400 and 2,500 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly at the northern terminus near Twisp. History SR 153 follows the route of the unpaved Methow-Barron Road, which was established in 1897 and later became State Road 12 in 1905. State Route 12 was named as part of the Roosevelt Highway in 1919 and became the secondary Methow Valley Highway in 1923. The Methow Valley Highway was later made into a primary state highway in 1925 and became Primary State Highway 16 (PSH 16) during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937. PSH 16 was extended westward and became the North Cross State Highway in 1961, before the establishment of SR 153 during the 1964 highway renumbering.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of R√ºdesheim, whose seat is in the municipality of R√ºdesheim an der Nahe. Roxheim is a winegrowing village. Geography =Location= Roxheim lies on the Katzenbach north of the Nahe. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Roxheim's neighbours are the municipalities of Gutenberg and Hargesheim, the town of Bad Kreuznach and the municipalities of R√ºdesheim an der Nahe, Mandel, Sankt Katharinen, Sommerloch and Wallhausen, all of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Roxheim are the outlying homesteads of Rollars M√ºhle and Schau√ü M√ºhle.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 16 (PDF; 2,3 MB) History In old documents from the 8th century, the village's name appears as Hrocchesheim (773, 781, 785, 790), Roghesheim (813) and later, in the 9th century, Rocchesheim. It contains the name Hrocus or Hroccus and is interpreted as meaning ‚ÄúThe Frank Hrocculf‚Äôs Home‚Äù. In the 8th and 9th centuries, this village heaped up clues in its earliest records to many donations to Fulda Abbey. Pr√ºm Abbey, too, held lands within what is now Roxheim according to those records. In 1225, Rhinegrave and Knight Wolfram vom Stein transferred the church patronage that he held ‚Äì presumably a fief held from the Counts of the Nahegau ‚Äì to Saint Catherine's Abbey, which existed until the Reformation. Likewise, for 1282, evidence shows that a knight of the House of Dalberg had holdings in Roxheim, Braunweiler, Hargesheim and Gutenberg. Beginning in 1350, the village belonged to the small Sponheim Amt of Gutenberg. In 1369, the Counts of Sponheim were first mentioned as the ones who held Roxheim when Count Walram of Sponheim freed Eberbach Abbey‚Äôs holdings in Roxheim and elsewhere from lordly levies and taxes. Pr√ºm Abbey‚Äôs holdings around Roxheim then ended up held by the monastery‚Äôs V√∂gte, who were the Imperial ministeriales, the Lords of Stein, and from them, they passed to the Counts of Sponheim. ‚ÄúIncome books‚Äù kept by the Sponheims‚Äô rightful successors name Roxheim in, for instance, 1476 and 1601. It then belonged to the Oberamt of Kreuznach. In a 15th-century court seal with the circumscription ‚ÄúGERICHT ROXHEIM‚Äù (‚ÄúRoxheim Court‚Äù), Saint Sebastian is depicted. Another court seal from 1633 bears the circumscription ‚ÄúROXHEIMER GERICHTSSIEGEL AO. 1633‚Äù. Originally, Roxheim belonged to an Imperial estate complex, for by the 15th century, the villagers were still allowed to bring themselves and their belongings to the town of Kreuznach for safety behind its walls, for which service they had to contribute to the town wall's upkeep, and sometimes even defend it. They also did not need to pay a toll at the town gates. The wars of the 16th to 18th centuries also affected Roxheim. At the time when the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim was partitioned in 1707, Roxheim found itself in the Electorate of the Palatinate Oberamt of Kreuznach. In 1776, the church tithe was only being shared out in fifths. Napoleonic times brought the German lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank a time of French rule lasting 20 years. Roxheim lay in the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Mandel, the Canton of Creuznach, the Arrondissement of Simmern and the Department of Rhin-et-Moselle. The Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) imposed territorial changes of Europe-wide importance in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. The Kingdom of Prussia was awarded great swathes of the Rhine's left bank. Roxheim was assigned to the Prussian Kreuznach district, formed on 14 May 1816, and together with Mandel, Braunweiler, Gutenberg, Hargesheim, R√ºdesheim and Sankt Katharinen, it formed the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Mandel. As early as 1820, there was a change to local administration under which the two B√ºrgermeistereien of Mandel and H√ºffelsheim (with H√ºffelsheim, M√ºnster am Stein, Niederhausen, Norheim, Traisen and Weinsheim) were thrust together into a new, greater B√ºrgermeisterei of H√ºffelsheim-Mandel. Although the administrative seat at first lay in Weinsheim, it was moved in 1853 to R√ºdesheim. Apart from the transfer of Bad M√ºnster am Stein out of the B√ºrgermeisterei in 1912, little about this administrative arrangement changed until administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1969 and 1970. Especially after the Second World War, the originally purely agriculturally orientated municipality, like so many other villages in the district, grew into a modern residential community. It casts itself as a home community right near the district seat of Bad Kreuznach (on which it borders, and to which there are excellent road links) where the once so important agricultural activity (cropraising and livestock raising) have in recent years greatly lost their economic eminence. On the other hand, winegrowing has lately gained considerable importance with its bottled-wine marketing, its Strau√üwirtschaften and the winemaking estates that run them.History Religion As at 31 December 2013, there are 2,368 full-time residents in Roxheim, and of those, 1,086 are Evangelical (45.861%), 808 are Catholic (34.122%), 1 belongs to the Bad Kreuznach-Koblenz Jewish worship community (0.042%), 50 (2.111%) belong to other religious groups and 423 (17.863%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The bunch of grapes in dexter chief refers to the village's winegrowing and the ‚Äúchequy‚Äù main field is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Counts of Sponheim, while the three crossed arrows symbolize Saint Sebastian, who was martyred by being shot through with arrows. Indeed, this actual image can be found on Roxheim's old court seal with the circumscription Gericht Roxheim (‚ÄúRoxheim Court‚Äù).Description and explanation of Roxheim‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing Hauptstra√üe =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district * Evangelical parish church, Hauptstra√üe 24 ‚Äì quire tower towards 1300, belfry floor and hip roof possibly from the 18th century, Baroque nave, 1738 * Saint Sebastian‚Äôs Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Sebastian), Hauptstra√üe 71 ‚Äì Romanesque Revival sandstone-block building, 1869‚Äì1871, Building Master Himpler, Wallerfangen * Hauptstra√üe, graveyard ‚Äì warriors‚Äô memorial 1914-1918, steles, 1920s * Hauptstra√üe 69 ‚Äì Catholic rectory; Late Baroque building with hip roof, 1740; Late Baroque Crucifix, marked 1788 * Obere Kirchgasse 1 ‚Äì Late Baroque timber- frame house, partly solid, late 18th century * Untere Kirchgasse 2 ‚Äì Evangelical rectory; Late Baroque plastered building, about 1750 =Clubs= The following clubs are active in Roxheim:Clubs *CDU Ortsverband ‚Äî Christian Democratic Union of Germany local chapter *Deutsches Rotes Kreuz ‚Äî German Red Cross local chapter *Drachen-und Gleitsegelclub Nahetal e.V. ‚Äî hang gliding club *Evangelische Zunft Von 1864 RoxheimZ√ºnfte ‚Äî Evangelical ‚Äúguild‚Äù (see below) *F√∂rderverein Roxheimer Kinder und Jugend e.V. ‚Äî child and youth promotional association *Freiwillige FeuerwehrFire brigade ‚Äî volunteer fire brigade *FWG Freie W√§hlergemeinschaft ‚Äî Free Voters association *Katholische Zunft Von RoxheimZ√ºnfte ‚Äî Catholic ‚Äúguild‚Äù (see below) *MGV ‚ÄúFrohsinn‚Äù ‚Äî men's singing club *Musikverein Musikfreunde ‚Äî music club *‚ÄúRoxemer The√§terche‚Äù ‚Äî amateur theatre group *SPD Ortsverein ‚Äî Social Democratic Party of Germany local chapter *TUS 1906 Roxheim ‚Äî gymnastic and sport club *VfL 1976 Roxheim ‚Äî exercise club The two ‚Äúguilds‚Äù mentioned in the list are associations that lend aid and comfort to the bereaved at their time of loss.

Both this road and Kreisstra√üe 51 lead southwards to a common interchange onto Bundesstra√üe 41, leading to Bad Kreuznach‚Äôs northeast end and the Autobahn A 61 (Koblenz‚ÄìLudwigshafen) not far beyond. Landesstra√üe 236 also leads northwards to meet the same Autobahn at Waldlaubersheim. Serving neighbouring Bad Kreuznach is a railway station.

From Bingen am Rhein, Regionalbahn trains run by way of the Alsenz Valley Railway, which branches off the Nahe Valley Railway in Bad M√ºnster am Stein, to Kaiserslautern, reaching it in roughly 65 minutes. Running on the line to Saarbr√ºcken and by way of Gau Algesheim and the West Rhine Railway to Mainz are Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains. The travel time to Mainz lies between 25 and 40 minutes, and to Saarbr√ºcken between 1 hour and 40 minutes and 2 hours and 20 minutes. =Education= Unlike many other villages, Roxheim has retained responsibility for its own primary school. With the exception of a few children who come from surrounding villages, all the pupils there are from the village itself. Hence, there is no school bus service.Primary school Roxheim also has a daycare centreKita and a municipal library.Library =Established businesses= Roxheim has a grocery shop, a butcher‚Äôs shop and a bakery.

History The village of Sankt Katharinen goes back to the Cistercian monastery of the same name that stood here from the early 13th century until 1574. This monastery was home to Cistercian nuns. In the early 13th century, it was founded by the nuns from Kumbd Abbey (Kloster Kumbd in German; the village there is still called Klosterkumbd), and in 1219, Archbishop of Mainz Siegfried II acknowledged the settlement. In 1574, however, the Electorate of the Palatinate put an end to its days as a monastic institution. Oversight was exercised by the Abbot of Eberbach Abbey in the Rheingau. Sankt Katharinen was among Eberbach‚Äôs incorporated monasteries. The founding story translated into German by Johann Christian von Stramberg and Heinrich Pr√∂hle, farmer Adalbert‚Äôs epic poem, goes back to Johannes Trithemius‚Äôs Sponheim Chronicle, which was in Latin. Nothing now remains of the monastery, but the village that sprang up with it is still there. Religion As at 31 December 2013, there are 367 full-time residents in Sankt Katharinen, and of those, 88 are Evangelical (23.978%), 208 are Catholic (56.676%) and 71 (19.346%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Sankt Katharinen‚Äôs mayor is Manuel Schneider, and his deputies are Hans-Walter Nies and Markus Krieg.Sankt Katharinen‚Äôs executive =Coat of arms= The municipality‚Äôs arms might be described thus: Argent in base an inescutcheon chequy of twenty azure and Or standing behind and above which Saint Catherine vested gules, crined and crowned of the third holding in her dexter hand a sword of the fourth hilted and pommelled of the third palewise point to base, and in her sinister hand half a wheel spoked of four sable.

The latter road leads eastwards to Roxheim, whence it runs to Bundesstra√üe 41, leading to Bad Kreuznach‚Äôs northeast end and the Autobahn A 61 (Koblenz‚ÄìLudwigshafen) not far beyond. Serving nearby Bad Kreuznach is a railway station. Branching off the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken) here is the railway line to Gau Algesheim. From Bingen am Rhein, Regionalbahn trains run by way of the Alsenz Valley Railway, which branches off the Nahe Valley Railway in Bad M√ºnster am Stein, to Kaiserslautern, reaching it in roughly 65 minutes. Running on the line to Saarbr√ºcken and by way of Gau Algesheim and the West Rhine Railway to Mainz are Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains. The travel time to Mainz lies between 25 and 40 minutes, and to Saarbr√ºcken between 1 hour and 40 minutes and 2 hours and 20 minutes.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of R√ºdesheim, whose seat is in the municipality of R√ºdesheim an der Nahe. Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim is a winegrowing village. Geography =Location= In terms of geographical landscape regions, Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim and its surrounding countryside belong to the Lower Naheland, which is framed to the northwest by the Soonwald's southern foothills, to the south by the North Palatine Uplands and to the east by Rhenish Hesse and the Rhine itself. The area lies in the west of the Nahe- Alsenz Felsenland (\\"rock country\\") at the transitional zone leading into the Sobernheim valley broadening. The village itself lies roughly 10 km southwest of the district seat of Bad Kreuznach. Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim sits at elevations ranging from 125 to 303 m above sea level, and its municipal area measures 4.76 km¬≤. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim's neighbours are the municipalities of Weinsheim, H√ºffelsheim, Niederhausen, Oberhausen an der Nahe and Waldb√∂ckelheim, all of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. =Constituent communities= Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim's Ortsteile are Thalb√∂ckelheim and Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim. Also belonging to Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim are the outlying homesteads of Hahnerhof, Heimbergerhof, Kolonie, Niederth√§lerhof, Rotherhof and Schlo√ühof.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 16 (PDF; 2,3 MB) =Climate= The Middle Naheland is part of a warm and dry area lying alee of the Hunsr√ºck in which many rare submediterranean and subcontinental plant species can be found. Yearly precipitation in Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim amounts to 566 mm, which is very low, falling into the lowest fourth of the precipitation chart for all Germany. Only at 14% of the German Weather Service's weather stations are even lower figures recorded. The driest month is February. The most rainfall comes in June. In that month, precipitation is 1.6 times what it is in February. Precipitation varies slightly. Only at 3% of the weather stations are lower seasonal Schwankungen recorded. =Flora= Belonging to the scenically loveliest and botanically particularly interesting areas of the Middle Nahe valley are the steep slopes and valley floors in and near Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim, areas worthy of conservation. There are craggy areas, steppe grasses and dry scrub growing on volcanic subsoil. Remnants of a riparian forest in the area of the Nahe's banks define the natural vegetation around Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim. Winegrowing likewise defines the countryside scenery. Subcontinental plants exist in the Nahe valley along the western edge, while submediterranean ones can be found here at the northern border of their ranges. Plant communities with species that thrive in warmth colonize mostly stony and craggy slopes in the Nahe valley with southwestern exposure. Together with the ‚ÄúNahegau‚Äù conservation area, Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim has unique, rare and valuable biotopes between the Heimberg and the Sch√§ferberg. The conservation area is part of the steep, craggy southeastern slope north of the Nahe. Because of the unusual vegetation, this Heimberg-Sch√§ferberg-Felsenberg landscape is sometimes compared to certain parts of central Italy or Dalmatia and the tree-sparse steppe heaths and maquis found there. History The old name forms of Waldb√∂ckelheim (now a neighbouring municipality), Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim and Talb√∂ckelheim (now an outlying centre), can be traced back to an 824 document that names '. The name Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim first cropped up only in the 17th century. In the 19th century, the name Thalb√∂ckelheim first came to light. On 1 November 1910, municipal council agreed to introduce Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim as the municipality's name. The name Talb√∂ckelheim seems to have had its spelling changed in line with the spelling reforms over the years; it is now written without the first H, but the name Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim itself has not been changed in the wake of the German orthography reform of 1996; the √ü has not been changed to SS. The three prefixes that serve to distinguish the three centres whose names are otherwise the same are all standard German words with well understood meanings: Wald (‚Äúforest‚Äù); Schlo√ü (or Schloss in up-to-date spelling; ‚Äúcastle/palace‚Äù); Tal (‚Äúdale/valley‚Äù). The village chronicle has this to say about the village's name: > Until the beginning of the last century (meant here is the 19th century) the > village was named after the castle Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim, which still existed in > the 17th century. The castle was destroyed by the French in 1688. The > village of Thalb√∂ckelheim consists of the two constituent centres of > Thalb√∂ckelheim and Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim: Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim with the ruin of > Castle B√∂ckelheim lies on the mountainside and the constituent centre of > Thalb√∂ckelheim lies 0.5 km away down in the dale. Both constituent centres > have roughly the same population figure. The village‚Äôs name was changed in > quite a peculiar way. In the early part of the last century, in response to > an inquiry by the authorities as to what the village was called, because it > consisted of two constituent centres, the name Thalb√∂ckelheim was given by > the then Sch√∂ffe (roughly ‚Äúlay jurist‚Äù). The Sch√∂ffe lived in the > constituent centre of Thalb√∂ckelheim and a certain selfishness on his part > made him want to call the village Thalb√∂ckelheim, without regard to the > historical importance of the constituent centre of Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim. None of > the locally customary rural cadastral names had to do with the name > Thalb√∂ckelheim, but rather they were named after Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim, like > Schlo√üb√∂ckelheimer M√ºhlberg, Schlo√üb√∂ckelheimer Felsenberg, > Schlo√üb√∂ckelheimer Kupfergrube and so on. Wines had earned quite an > important reputation as Schlo√üb√∂ckelheimer in the wine trade, whereas > Thalb√∂ckelheim never cropped up in the wine trade. Municipal council asked > on these grounds to have the historical name Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim reinstated, as > it was already well known throughout Germany for Emperor Heinrich IV‚Äôs > imprisonment at Castle B√∂ckelheim (1105). Also given as grounds for the reversion to the older name was the name's recognizability in winegrowing and the wine trade. A decree made on 22 April 1911 approved the municipality's application. Since this time, the two constituent centres of Thalb√∂ckelheim and Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim have been united under the collective name ‚ÄúSchlo√üb√∂ckelheim‚Äù. Among the places in the middle Naheraum (regions flanking the Nahe), Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim belongs among those places that were already often being mentioned in the Middle Ages. Castle B√∂ckelheim, built on what was to become Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim's municipal area, was among the oldest in the region. Generally regarded as the village's first documentary mention is a document from 16 February 824. Late in 1105, Emperor Heinrich V, the last of the Salian dynasty, had his father, Emperor Heinrich IV taken prisoner in Ingelheim and then brought to Castle B√∂ckelheim to be held prisoner there. In 1688, the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession) broke out. That year, the castle was destroyed on French orders.History Religion As at 31 December 2013, there are 376 full-time residents in Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim, and of those, 160 are Evangelical (42.553%), 163 are Catholic (43.351%), 5 (1.33%) belong to other religious groups and 48 (12.766%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim's mayor is Rudolf Staab, and his deputies are Karlheinz Lorenz and Volker Walg.Schlo√üb√∂ckelheim‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Chequy of twenty azure and Or, on a chief gules a bunch of grapes leafed of one and slipped and a wheel spoked of six, both of the second.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Langenlonsheim-Stromberg, whose seat is in Langenlonsheim. Sch√∂neberg is a winegrowing village. Geography =Location= Sch√∂neberg lies in the Hunsr√ºck on a mountain ridge in the Soonwald between the Guldenbach and Gr√§fenbach valleys, roughly 10 km southwest of the River Rhine at Bingerbr√ºck. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Sch√∂neberg's neighbours are the municipality of D√∂rrebach, the town of Stromberg, and the municipalities of Schweppenhausen, Windesheim, Hergenfeld and Spabr√ºcken, all of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. Owing to a peculiarity in the way in which the municipal boundaries are laid out, the village site of Eckenroth, whose municipal area does not border on Sch√∂neberg's, actually lies nearer the village site of Sch√∂neberg than the village site of Schweppenhausen does. History As far back as ancient times, the place where Sch√∂neberg now lies was being used by Romans as an important way station. Proof of this comes from, among other things, the foundations of a villa rustica with a hypocaust, which were unearthed in the course of building work. The military road running by Sch√∂neberg from Kreuznach to Koblenz later served postal coach traffic. Sch√∂neberg thus had regular links to other places by way of the Thurn und Taxis postal riders as an Ordinari Postort, a regular stop. In 983, the village passed from Imperial ownership to the Archfoundation of Mainz and was later granted to various knightly families. A man with a link to the village, Johann von Sch√∂nenberg, even became the Archbishop-Elector of Trier and the instigator of the Trier witch trials. The von Schonenburg lordly family built the first castle house in 1539, on whose foundations their descendants built a newer one that still stands today in 1686. The earlier house had also been Johann von Sch√∂nenberg's childhood home. Later, the village passed to the Palatinate, who enfeoffed the Counts of Ingelheim with it. This lordship ended when French Revolutionary troops came marching into the region.History History =The Sch√∂neberg postal road= The postal road corresponded along much of its length with the former Roman road. It was the so-called Niederl√§ndischer Postkurs (Dutch Postal Route), which led from Simmern over the heights of the Hunsr√ºck to Seibersbach, D√∂rrebach, Sch√∂neberg, Hergenfeld, the Breitenfelser-Hof and Kreuznach. Sch√∂neberg has this situation to thank for its being an Ordinari Postort from the 14th century until about 1630. That is to say that Sch√∂neberg was regularly served by postal riders and postal coaches, whereas nearby Stromberg, as an Extraordin√§ri Postort, was only served from Sch√∂neberg on request. Only sometime between 1620 and 1632 was the postal service transferred from Sch√∂neberg to Stromberg, for it is known that by that time that there was a postmaster in Stromberg.The Sch√∂neberg postal road =Sch√∂neberg as a castle village= Sch√∂neberg is what in German is called an unechter Burgort (‚Äúfalse castle village‚Äù), meaning that the village and the castle actually developed apart from each other; it was thus not a case of a castle giving rise to a village outside its walls. Nonetheless, it must be borne in mind that a village in the Middle Ages was not what is commonly imagined today as a village. Most villages were made up of some 30 straw- thatched houses. The streets were unpaved and had open sewage drains. Most had a village well open to everyone and also a firepond. This description of a village held true into the 18th century and only slowly did it change in the 19th century. Sch√∂neberg's beginnings may have arisen at what is now the village's northern outskirts, whereas the castle complex only arose later and about one kilometre to the west. The old Sch√∂neberg churchyard was mentioned in 1577 and lay on what is today the Kreisstra√üe that leads to Eckenroth, at the corner of H√∂ller Weg. It was until the 17th century the graveyard for the whole parish area of Sch√∂neberg and Hergenfeld. However, as the village slowly grew towards the castle and the castle church became the parish church sometime about 1700, the people reverted to the old tradition of burying their dead around the church. In 1895, the old church (originally the castle church) was torn down and the site turned into a burying ground. After further expansions, today's graveyard eventually arose. The shift towards the castle was hardly groundless: people obviously felt safer from robbers and bandits if they were near a castle.Sch√∂neberg as a castle village =The Lords of Sch√∂nenberg= From 1504 to 1581, the local Amtmann, the highest official in the Amt of Stromberg, was furnished by the Lords of Sch√∂nenberg: *1504-1509: Phillipp von Sch√∂nenberg *1509-1530: Johann von Sch√∂nenberg *1530-1542: Diether von Sch√∂nenberg *1542-1552: Reichard Greifenclau zu Vollrads, Diether von Sch√∂nenberg's son-in-law *1552-1581: Hans Valentin von Sch√∂nenberg Hans Valentin zu Sch√∂nenberg was first mentioned in 1552 as a Palatine Amtmann at Stromberg. No later than 1560, he was enfeoffed with the Lordship of Sch√∂neberg. Whether Hans Valentin zu Sch√∂nenberg appointed the first Protestant clergyman to Sch√∂neberg of his own will or at Electoral Palatinate‚Äôs behest is unclear. What is clear, however, from the fact that he sent two of his sons to study at the University of Marburg in 1568, is that at this time, he stood squarely on the Protestant side. Hans Valentin zu Sch√∂nenberg had a brother, Johann von Sch√∂nenberg. He was the cathedral provost at Trier, Stadthalter (‚Äústeward‚Äù) for the city of Trier, rector of the University of Trier and, as Johann VII, the Archbishop-Elector of Trier from 1581 to 1599 and a steadfast follower of the old belief (Catholicism) who unforbearingly banned the Protestants from Trier. In 1602, Archbishop-Elector of Mainz enfeoffed Hans Reichard von Sch√∂nenberg with Sch√∂neberg and Hergenfeld for himself, as the eldest, and his brother's underage sons. After the Sch√∂nenbergs died out in the male line in 1632, the Counts of Sch√∂nburg at Oberwesel became the fiefholders.Lords of Sch√∂nenberg =Jewish history= Sch√∂neberg had a small Jewish community in the 19th century. Jews were first mentioned as being in the village in the 16th century: sometime about 1548 or 1550, a protection money payment list named the village's Jews. It read in part: > In amptem Stromberg beckellum und Crutzennach. Menche von Schonberg sol > geben v. fl. halb bart und halb martini‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúMenche‚Äù was a short form of the given name ‚ÄúMenachem‚Äù (‚Äú◊û◊†◊ó◊ù‚Äù); he was to pay five Rhenish guilders in two instalments through the year. Nevertheless, the number of Jews then in the village was quite small. In 1808, there were 15 Jewish inhabitants in Sch√∂neberg, and 26 in 1858, out of a total of 587 inhabitants. Also belonging to the Sch√∂neberg Jewish community were the Jews living in Hergenfeld and Spabr√ºcken, which in 1858 amounted to 10 and 15 inhabitants respectively. By 1895, the number of Jewish inhabitants in Sch√∂neberg had shrunk to 4. Living in Spabr√ºcken, meanwhile, were 21. In 1925, only two were still living in Sch√∂neberg, while there were 8 in Spabr√ºcken and none in Hergenfeld. It is believed that by the late 19th century, Spabr√ºcken's Jewish inhabitants belonged to the Argenschwang community. In the way of institutions, there were presumably a prayer room at one of the Jewish houses and a graveyard. After 1933, when Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power, only one Jew still lived in Sch√∂neberg, an invalid named Simon Michel (b. 1897 in Hettenleidelheim; named in the 1939 book of inhabitants) who was deported to Riga and died. According to the Gedenkbuch ‚Äì Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933-1945 (‚ÄúMemorial Book ‚Äì Victims of the Persecution of the Jews under National Socialist Tyranny‚Äù) and Yad Vashem, of all Jews who either were born in Spabr√ºcken or lived there for a long time, 5 died in the time of the Third Reich (birthdates in brackets):Jewish history #Isaak Schwarz (1879) #Karoline Schwarz (1874) #Leo Schwarz (1872) #Theodor Schwarz (1883) #Leopold Wolf (1865) Religion As at 31 January 2014, there are 633 full-time residents in Sch√∂neberg, and of those, 157 are Evangelical (24.803%), 345 are Catholic (54.502%), 9 (1.422%) belong to other religious groups and 122 (19.273%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Baumg√§rtner.Sch√∂neberg‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess enhanced sable three crosses patt√©e argent and per pale gules a wheel spoked of six of the second and sable a lion rampant Or armed, langued and crowned of the third. Sch√∂neberg's history is shown in condensed form in its coat of arms. The three crosses seen in the upper field are an heraldic device once borne by the Knights of Schonenburg, while below this on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is the Wheel of Mainz, and on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side, the Palatine Lion.Description and explanation of Sch√∂neberg‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district * Catholic Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (Kirche zur Kreuzauffindung), Schlossstra√üe 1 ‚Äì Late Romanesque Revival hall church, quarrystone, 1895, architects Carl R√ºdell and Richard Odenthal * Hauptstra√üe 23 ‚Äì estate complex; lordly Late Classicist building with half-hip roof, partly timber-frame, marked 1843; stable and barn addition in the manner of an estate complex along the street; further long side building, 19th century * At Hauptstra√üe 37 ‚Äì spolia, Renaissance portal lintel, marked 1568 * Near Hauptstra√üe 52 ‚Äì wayside cross, Late Baroque, from the latter half of the 18th century * Near Schlossstra√üe 3 ‚Äì village fountain, 18th or 19th century, restoration possibly in the 1920s * Schlossstra√üe 4 ‚Äì house, gate complex, Baroque timber-frame house, partly solid, half-hip roof, marked 1688 * Schlossstra√üe 5 ‚Äì former castle house; building with half-hip roof, possibly from 1539, conversion possibly in 1686, ringwall remnants * Schlossstra√üe 5‚Äì11, 8‚Äì12 (monumental zone) ‚Äì area of the former palatial residence of the Lords of Sch√∂neberg (no. 5, 16th century); village's early seed centre separated from the rest of the built-up area by the graveyard with today six estate complexes grouped around a yard from the 16th century to the first fourth of the 20th century * Forsthaus Neupfalz (forester's house), on Landesstra√üe 240, northwest of the village ‚Äì group of buildings in Heimatstil, about 1905 * Jewish graveyard, south of the village (monumental zone) ‚Äì area with five gravestones from the 19th century and the early 20th century (see also below) The former school building, now community centre The former school in Sch√∂neberg was built on a meadow in 1826 by Master Mason Jakob Schweigert from Sch√∂neberg to plans by Master Builder B√§r from Kreuznach. The schoolroom was upstairs with two small, north-facing rooms, and downstairs was the teacher's dwelling. In 1893, an addition was built onto the schoolhouse's west side, containing the two schoolrooms, a cellar, a storehouse, the stairwell and for each teacher's dwelling a small room. In 1989, today's community centre came into being through the expansion and conversion of what had until now been the school building.The former school building, now community centre =Jewish graveyard= The time when the Jewish graveyard in Sch√∂neberg arose is unknown. Only four gravestones are still preserved, dating from between 1885 and 1924. The graveyard covers an area of 1 362 m¬≤. From the graveyard's size it seems clear that the dead from surrounding Jewish communities (Hergenfeld and Spabr√ºcken) were also buried here. In the time of the Third Reich, it is believed that the graveyard was largely removed. Some of the gravestones might have disappeared under weed overgrowth. After 1945, the graveyard was reinstated as far as was then possible. It lies roughly one kilometre south of the village centre in the area called ‚ÄúAuf dem Gerstenberg‚Äù near the Windesheimer Wald (forest) and can be reached by a farm lane that branches off the road to Hergenfeld (not far from the crossing near the sporting ground) eastwards towards the edge of the forest.Jewish graveyard =Regular events= Each year on 3 May, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, Sch√∂neberg holds its kermis (church consecration festival). If the feast day falls on a weekday, the kermis is held on the following Sunday and Monday.Regular events =Sport and leisure= Found on the Neupfalz, between Sch√∂neberg and Stromberg is the Wald-Erlebniszentrum Soonwald (‚ÄúSoonwald Forest Adventure Centre‚Äù). Lying in the middle of the forest, it offers visitors the opportunity for an intensive nature experience. Both for school and youth groups and for adults and families, the offerings include one-day or several- day programmes in environmental education as applied to woodlands and forest adventures. The forestry office's 9,000 or so hectares of woods allow visitors a hands-on experience. Furthermore, there are facilities available for use, such as the forest laboratory, the forest workshop and the Internet room with its adjoining library. Only a stone's throw from the Centre, just short of D√∂rrebach, is a locality called the Lehnm√ºhle (historically a mill). Apart from a few houses, what predominates here is agriculture. Worth experiencing above all else is the homemade cheese, which is known far beyond the municipality's limits and is prized by gourmets.Sport and leisure Sch√∂neberg also has a grilling pavilion, a bowls pitch and a community centre. =Clubs= The following clubs are active in Sch√∂neberg:Clubs *MGV Liederkranz e.V. Sch√∂neberg ‚Äî men's singing club *Freunde der Feuerwehr Sch√∂neberg e.V. ‚Äî fire brigade promotional association *Sch√∂neberger Schlo√ütheater e.V. ‚Äî theatrical group Economy and infrastructure =Economic structure= Besides the customary agriculture, whose yields were rather scant, Sch√∂neberg villagers of the past also busied themselves as broomsquires. Many inhabitants, not only of Sch√∂neberg but of the whole Hunsr√ºck region, emigrated to Canada and the United States. More recently, the villagers have concentrated on other crafts such as automotive, electric, hairdressing, roofing and carpentry. There are likewise shopping opportunities for daily needs at the little village shop. Vehicle-based businesses also visit the village from nearby bakeries and butcher's shops. Financial services are covered, albeit only partly, by the local insurance agencies. =Transport= Running through Sch√∂neberg is Kreisstra√üe 29, known locally as Hauptstra√üe (‚ÄúMain Street‚Äù), which is met by Kreisstra√üe 45, known locally as Neupf√§lzer Stra√üe (‚ÄúNew Palatine Street‚Äù), in the village's west end. Kreisstra√üe 29 leads eastwards to the interchange onto the Autobahn A 61 (Koblenz‚ÄìLudwigshafen) at Waldlaubersheim. There are bus links from Sch√∂neberg by route 244 to Bad Kreuznach in one direction and Spabr√ºcken, Argenschwang and M√ºnchwald in the other.Bus links Sch√∂neberg is not conveniently placed for any railway. Nevertheless, serving Bad Kreuznach, which can be reached by bus, is a railway station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken). Branching off here is also the railway line to Gau Algesheim. From Bingen am Rhein, Regionalbahn trains run by way of the Alsenz Valley Railway, which branches off the Nahe Valley Railway in Bad M√ºnster am Stein, to Kaiserslautern, reaching it in roughly 65 minutes. Running on the line to Saarbr√ºcken and by way of Gau Algesheim and the West Rhine Railway to Mainz are Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains. The travel time to Mainz lies between 25 and 40 minutes, and to Saarbr√ºcken between 1 hour and 40 minutes and 2 hours and 20 minutes. Sch√∂neberg may soon have a more convenient rail service if the plans to reactivate the Cross-Hunsr√ºck Railway (Hunsr√ºckquerbahn), which runs through neighbouring Stromberg, meet with success. This would afford quick access not only to Mainz, in one direction, but also to Frankfurt-Hahn Airport in the other. =Winegrowing= Sch√∂neberg's preferred vineyard locations have been found since yore at the edge of the Aubach or Steyerbach valley. These locations are distinguished mainly by their cultivation using slopes. The wines from these vineyards are mainly fruity and tangy. For years, however, the number of winemakers has fast been falling.Winegrowing The two locations known as Sch√§fersley and Sonnenberg lie at the northern edge of the Nahe wine region and belong to the winemaking appellation ‚Äì Gro√ülage ‚Äì Pfarrgarten. Winegrowing was brought to the region by the Romans.Winegrowing =Education= Sch√∂neberg has no educational institutions of its own. Both the daycare centre and the primary school (grade levels 1 to 4) are to be found in Schweppenhausen, about 4 km away. After primary school, children may be enrolled at the all-day school in Stromberg. There are also secondary schools in nearby places:Education *Stromberg: Integrierte Gesamtschule (IGS) *Wallhausen: Realschule plus Geschwister- Scholl-Schule *Hargesheim: Gesamtschule Alfred-Delp-Schule *Bad Kreuznach: Realschule an der Heidenmauer *Bad Kreuznach: Gymnasium an der Stadtmauer (Stama) *Bad Kreuznach: Lina-Hilger-Gymnasium (Lihi) *Bad Kreuznach: Gymnasium am R√∂merkastell (R√∂ka) =Public institutions= Sch√∂neberg has a municipal public library, a community centre and a volunteer fire brigade with a promotional association.

Schools within the Network integrate four years of college preparatory academics with continuous professional work experience that pays most of the cost of a student's education. The Network includes 35 Catholic work-study preparatory schools in the United States. Cristo Rey schools admit students of all faiths and cultures, and on average 46% of Cristo Rey students are not Catholic.  History  In 1996, Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Chicago was opened by the Society of Jesus to help \\"students from underserved, low-income communities\\" prepare for college. To subsidize this effort, the school partnered with businesses, using a work-study approach, which over time became the hallmark of the Cristo Rey model. It proved helpful in preparing students for college and for entry into the business world. In 2004, a segment on CBS 60 Minutes drew attention to the model. Some Catholic educators nationwide and some prominent philanthropists who were committed to educational reform also joined the Network. Cristo Rey graduates began enrolling in college at rates consistent with the enrollment levels of high-income students, and completing college at a rate considerably higher than high school graduates from low- income families nationwide. The peer-reviewed Catholic Education, A Journal of Inquiry and Practice documented the replication of the model nationally and the standardization of the norms for membership. By 2015, 7,000 graduates of Cristo Rey had either earned their undergraduate degree or were currently enrolled in college. A Lexington Institute study in 2014 described Cristo Rey schools as \\"one of the nation‚Äôs most powerful urban education success stories.\\"  Corporate work study program  The Corporate Work Study Program was created in 1995 by Richard R. Murray, when he was approached by the founders of Cristo Rey to help find a way to finance their new school. Each Cristo Rey school partners with a Corporate Work Study Program. The Corporate Work Study Program (a separately incorporated entity) operates like a temporary employment agency within Cristo Rey schools and employs every student five days a month in an entry-level, professional job all four years of high school. Students earn much of their education cost through participation in the work study program. Typically a student, from the age of 14, will be earning about $18/hour in tuition support. The program has been praised for allowing students to gain real-world work experience across many different fields, including law, finance, healthcare, technology, marketing, university, and many other professional offices. The Corporate Work Study Program has been shown to have a significant formative impact on students ‚Äì demystifying the world outside their neighborhoods, developing workplace readiness skills, introducing them to role models and supportive mentors, and building competence, confidence, and aspiration for college and career success.  University partners  In 2009 the Network began its University Partners program which includes 45 university partners across the country. University Partners recruit, mentor, and support the Cristo Rey graduates, along guidelines supplied by the Network.  Religious sponsors and endorsers  Thirty-eight religious sponsors and endorsers are primarily responsible for the religious charism and Catholicity of the schools. While the first Cristo Rey school was started by the Society of Jesus and today the Jesuits sponsor and endorse 13 schools, the Cristo Rey Network partners with 38 dioceses, orders, and congregations. The curriculum of each school includes religious studies and a student ministry program through which they explore religion, faith, and spirituality. Youth of all faiths and no faiths are welcome, and 46% of the students in the Network are not Catholic.  Growth  The process of opening a new school begins after receiving approval from the local Bishop. Every Cristo Rey Network school must complete a 12-18 month feasibility study, an assessment of need and interest, to determine if a school could succeed in that community.  Recognition  In 2008, Fr. John P. Foley, S.J., received the Presidential Citizen's Medal for his leadership in introducing this new model to Catholic education. The same year Loyola Press released More than A Dream: How One School's Vision is Changing the World. The book documents the success of Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Chicago, along with the development of the Cristo Rey model and of the Cristo Rey Network of schools. The network received the 2012 Classy Award for Educational Advancement. In 2004 \\"the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Cassin Educational Initiative Foundation had announced plans \\"to grant $18.9 million to create 12 new small college-preparatory high schools across the country... modeled after the highly successful Cristo Rey Jesuit High School of Chicago,\\" and by 2008 the Gates Foundation had contributed $15.9 million for the spread of the model. In 2017 the Network was chosen as the primary beneficiary of the NFL's Corporate Cup Celebrity Challenge.

Extremely complex and with many baroque touches, it is something of a throwback to the original Ellery Queen novels of the late 1920s and early 1930s, unlike the more realistic mysteries of Queen's later period. It is set in New York state during three different times in the 20th century: Early 1905; the Christmas-New Year's holidays of 1929-1930; and midsummer 1957. Plot summary The story begins in the first week of January 1905, with a brief account of a tragic accident and its bizarre aftermath, including a cover-up. The action then shifts to the waning days of 1929. Shortly after the publication of his first novel, The Roman Hat Mystery, fledgling author/sleuth Ellery Queen is invited to an elaborate house party that will last through the 12 Days of Christmas. The party includes a number of people connected to a wealthy young man whose birth was mentioned in the 1905 section. The man is about to come into a large inheritance on his birthday, Jan. 6, 1930. In the days leading up to the man's birthday, a number of strange little gifts are left anonymously for him, as well as doodles and confusing, ominous notes with Christmas-themed verses. Soon the notes contain outright threats. By the time the party is over, there have been two separate murders in the mansion, but Queen and the police cannot solve either of them, and are lucky even to conclusively identify the victims. The investigation does uncover some facts about the 1905 cover-up, but the murders and the threats remain unexplained at the case goes cold, and it is not even clear if they are connected. Decades later, in 1957, a now middle-aged Queen unexpectedly acquires the police file on the case, including the original journal he kept during the investigation. Queen, with the improved perspective of years of experience, decides to re- examine the facts from 1930. Though it is too late to prove anything in court, he finally figures out who committed the murders and who left the gifts ‚Äî and why. Literary significance & criticism (See Ellery Queen.) This novel offers very little psychological realism, focusing instead on extremely unusual circumstances and bizarre clues that form an essentially abstract puzzle. As in the early Queen stories, there are many potential suspects and unconventional clues. There are also numerous literary and historical allusions, visual aids and even \\"in jokes.\\" For instance, the story says the character Ellery Queen, like the young heir, was born in 1905. This is at odds with accounts in the earliest Queen stories, but Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee, who co-wrote the novels under the \\"Ellery Queen\\" pen name, were both born in 1905. To quote some negative criticism of the novel: \\"Rhymed threats of murder, accompanied by symbolic objectives, bewilder the guests and annoy the reader. The pervasive vulgarity renders the trick plot even less believable and justifies the contempt of those who dismiss all crime fiction as puerile.\\"Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig.

The most famous musical setting of Brockes' text is that by George Frideric Handel (HWV 48). The text was also set by Reinhard Keiser (1712), Georg Philipp Telemann (1716), Johann Mattheson (1718), Gottfried Heinrich St√∂lzel (1725), Johann Friedrich Fasch (1723) and several other composers. Brockes' text Engraved portrait of Brockes (1744) by Christian Fritsch (1704‚Äì1760) Barthold Heinrich Brockes was an influential German poet who re-worked the traditional form of a Passion oratorio, adding reflective and descriptive poetry, sometimes of a highly-wrought and emotional kind, into the texture of his Passion. The Brockes Passion was much admired and set to music numerous times in Baroque Germany, although to other ages and in other countries some of Brockes' poetry has seemed in poor taste. In Brockes' version of a passion, a tenor Evangelist narrates, in recitative passages, events from all four Gospels' accounts of Jesus' suffering and death. Persons of the Gospel story (Jesus, Peter, Pilate, and so on) have dialogue passages, also in recitative; a chorus sings passages depicting the declamation of crowds; and poetic texts, sometimes in the form of arias, sometimes that of chorales, reflect on the events. Some of the arias are for the persons of the Passion, Jesus himself, Peter, etc., but Mary the mother of Jesus also has a singing part, and fictitious \\"characters\\", the Daughter of Zion, four solo Believing Souls, and A Chorus of Believing Souls, also observe and comment. Handel's setting Since 1712 the German-born Handel had been resident in London. It is not known exactly why or when Handel set the text of the Brockes Passion, already used by numerous other composers, to music, but it is known that the work was performed in Hamburg in 1719. Handel's Brockes Passion is \\"an entirely worthy contribution to the repertory of its genre.\\" It is a lengthy and contemplative work for vocal soloists, choir and instrumental ensemble with some passages of great beauty, such as the duet for Mary and her son. The few choruses, perhaps surprisingly in view of Handel's later large scale choral works, are short and perfunctory in comparison with the arias, some of which are in an operatic style, others with simple accompaniment of solo oboe or obbligato violin. Johann Sebastian Bach was influenced by the work in his St John Passion. In the last decade of his life Bach used seven arias of Handel's Brockes Passion in a St Mark Passion pastiche, and even performed it in his own arrangement in 1746.Bach Digital Work at Recordings *Edda Moser (soprano), Maria Stader (soprano), Jerry J.

Johannes Trithemius was one of the abbots. Traveling from university to his home town in 1482, he was surprised by a snowstorm and took refuge in the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim near Bad Kreuznach. He decided to stay and was elected abbot in 1483, at the age of twenty-one. In his time, the abbey library increased from around fifty items to more than two thousand. However, his efforts did not meet with praise, and his reputation as a magician did not further his acceptance. Increasing differences with the convent led to his resignation in 1506.

The battle, fought on 27 August 1895 near the city of Changhua in central Taiwan between the invading Japanese army and the forces of the short-lived Republic of Formosa, was a decisive Japanese victory, and doomed the Republic of Formosa to early extinction. The battle was one of the few occasions on which the Formosans were able to deploy artillery against the Japanese. WTFM CLAN ÈÅî‰∫∫ 1895 Ëá∫ÁÅ£Áç®Á´ãÊà∞Áà≠ Background Following the capture of Miaoli, the last Formosan stronghold in northern Taiwan, the Imperial Japanese Army advanced south towards Changhua, the largest city in central Taiwan and the gateway to southern Taiwan. The city was surrounded by hills that offered strong defensive positions, and was protected by the Bagua Battery () on the heights of Baguashan (), which was one kilometer east of the city. Changhua was also defended by walls, which was by no means usual at this period. Rebellions were frequent in Taiwan, and the Qing government preferred to keep Taiwanese cities unwalled. The vanguard units of the IJA reached the north bank of Dadu River on August 25, and immediately began preparation for crossing the river. In anticipation of a large scale confrontation, both sides tried to gather as many forces and supplies as possible. However, due to internal strife, the Formosans could only muster around 5,000 men, many of whom were remnants of militia units that were defeated in Miaoli, or raw recruits from Changhua; President Liu Yongfu ignored the repeated requests for reinforcement due to political rivalry with Li Jingsong (), the commander-general of northern Taiwan. Ê≠∑Âè≤ÊñáÂåñÂ≠∏ÁøíÁ∂≤ Êñ∞Ê•öËªçËàáÈªéÊôØÂµ© The Japanese massed about 15,000 soldiers, with support of modern artillery. On August 27, General Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa, commander of the Japanese forces in the area, inspected the front line at the bank to draw plan for an assault on the Formosan positions. He was spotted by the garrison in Bagua battery, who opened fire on him and his group of staff. The unexpected bombardment killed his second-in-command and wounded him; some sources alleged that the wound he received later cost him his life. The battle After nightfall on August 27, under the cover of darkness, several Japanese units crossed the river and moved into positions to attack. Unaware of the Japanese movement, the Formosans launched several raids against the Japanese that night, but achieved little. The Japanese left wing successfully reached the foot of Mount Baguashan undetected, and assaulted the battery at dawn. Despite being caught off guard and outnumbered, the Formosans held the battery until Wu Tang-hsing (), who was in charge of defense of the battery, was killed, and the garrison reduced to several dozen soldiers. A counterattack by a Black Banner unit was repulsed, and the remaining Formosans under Hsu Hsiang () were forced to abandon the battery. At the same time, Formosan units under Wu Peng-nien () engaged the Japanese in fierce fighting south of the river. Upon learning the loss of Bagua battery, Wu immediately led his men towards the battery and regrouped with Hsu. They then counterattacked the Japanese forces on Mount Baguashan in a last-ditch effort to destabilize the Japanese line, but were eventually thrown back with heavy losses. Wu was killed when his unit was surrounded by the Japanese, and Hsu managed to break out with a handful of men. After routing the Formosans, the Japanese bombarded the city of Changhua, caused panic among the civilians and garrison soldiers, who then fled the city. The Japanese then took the city unopposed, thus ended the fiercest battle in the history of Taiwan. The following account of the battle was given by James Davidson, who served as a war correspondent with the Japanese army during the campaign: > Changwha, a walled city, is situated less than five miles from the sea, in a > plain scarcely above its level. To the east lies a range of hills, the > highest of which‚ÄîHakkezan (Paquasoan)‚Äîwhich dominated the whole plain, was > crowned with a well-erected fort protected by four 12-centimetre late model > Krupp guns, besides a large number of the usual miscellaneous relics of > ancient warfare so beloved by the Chinese. To the north, about 3,000 metres > distant, ran a mountain stream which, with the heavy rains usual at this > time of year, had been converted into a surging river. It was on the > opposite banks of this river that the Japanese and Chinese troops met on the > 27th; the Japanese to the north hidden by fields of sugar-cane, which cover > the district; the Chinese to the south protected by earth-works of some > importance, which they had erected on the river bank; while a few rods to > the rear stood formidable breastworks. > It has always been the custom to ford the river at one point where it was > comparatively shallow, and it was at this point that the Chinese had built > their defences and gathered a large portion of their forces; for, if it > \\"blong olo custom\\" to cross at this place, the Japanese would, according to > Chinese reasoning, do the same. But the Japanese have a reputation for > dropping old customs, and they did so in this case. The right wing, under > command of Major-General Ogawa, remained at the camp to divert the Chinese > with large camp fires, etc.; while the left wing, under command of Major- > General Yamane, under the shadow of darkness, crossed the river with > considerable difficulty at a previously discovered ford some 1,500 metres > off. The column was now divided into three detachments. The first > detachment, under command of Major-General Yamane, made its way quietly > along to obtain a position to attack the city of Changwha itself. The second > detachment with a battery of mountain-guns crawled along through the sugar- > cane to cross the lower hills and gain a position to the east of the lofty > fort of Mount Hakkezan, while the third with great caution slowly and > quietly advanced to the rear of the Chinese troops guarding the river, and > between them and the city. > The whole force arrived at their positions without a hitch, and with the > enemy still watching the moving figures and the numerous camp fires of the > Japanese across the river. It was one of the cleverest exhibitions of > strategy displayed during the whole war. The right column crossed the river > before daylight, leaving a detachment at the camping grounds to keep up the > camp fires; and all were now in position ready for the attack. With the > first rays of morning, the Chinese were on the alert, and opened fire with > great bravado on the decoy troops left across the river. This was to the > Japanese the signal for action. Scarcely had the smoke cleared away when the > detachment which had occupied the position to the rear of the Chinese on the > river bank was down on the insurgents with a rush. The Chinese, too > surprised to make any defence, were terror-stricken. They jumped into the > river, ran right and left, even on to the bayonets of their opponents. > Simultaneously, the second detachment began to climb the hill at the back of > the fort of Hakkezan.

But the Japanese in the fort above them had witnessed the > whole scene and turned the insurgents‚Äô own guns down upon the city. The > Chinese had not thought of this; but like a flash their danger became > apparent; and from a position of calm defiance, they were thrown into a > frenzy of terror, and with a wild rush they sought escape through the South > Gate. But to their horrible dismay, they found the Japanese even there; and > turning back into the city they ran shrieking and howling like an army amok, > firing at anything that attracted their attention. Only a few shots had been > fired by the Japanese from the fort; and the Japanese infantry then scaled > the walls and poured down into the city in large numbers.

Detachments were at once detailed to pursue the retreating > insurgents, who had gone towards Kagi to the south and Lokang (Rokko) to the > west, where they hoped boats could be obtained to carry them to the south of > the island. Aftermath The battle was an impressive Japanese victory, and foreign observers praised the courage and skill with which the Japanese troops had captured such a strong position so quickly. For the Japanese, the opportunity to defeat the Formosans in a pitched battle was welcomed after the weeks of guerilla fighting they had experienced since the start of their march south from Taipei. The battle put an end to organized resistance against the Japanese in central Taiwan, and ultimately paved the way for the final Japanese advance on Tainan, the last major Formosan stronghold. However, the Japanese were unable to follow up their victory immediately. A severe outbreak of malaria at Changhua in early September 1895 ravaged the Japanese forces, killing more than 2,000 men, and continuing Formosan guerilla attacks kept the Japanese short of supplies. The Japanese temporarily halted their advance, and their inaction gave the Formosans time to regroup and organize an initially successful, but ultimately fruitless, counteroffensive. Cultural influences In 1965 a mass grave containing 679 bodies, believed to be those of Formosan fighters, was discovered at the site of battle. The site is now a memorial park, dedicated to those who perished in the battle.ÁøÅÈáëÁè†ÈÉ®ËêΩÊ†º ÂÖ´Âç¶Â±±1895Á¥ÄÂøµÂÖ¨ÂúíÊéÄÁÜ±ÊΩÆ The battle of Baguashan has recently been depicted as the climax to the film 1895 (released in November 2008), based on the life of the Formosan militia commander Wu Tang-hsing.

It was created by loyer Michele Lo Foco and manege by Marialina Marcucci and Pier Luigi Stefani (VM's Managing Director) in early 1984. The channel used to be broadcast from a location called \\"Il Ciocco\\", near the Castelvecchio Pascoli, Frazione of Barga in the province of Lucca (Tuscany). It was developed by spreading its terrestrial signal to most of the Italian regions. Its brand became very popular among young people. In 1988, its owners bought 90% of pan-European TV channel Super Channel, while the remaining 10% was taken over by Virgin. Between 1989 and 1990, Videomusic also produced some English language music shows for Super Channel. Most of these shows were produced in Italy and were considered amateurish by European viewers who were used to watching high-quality music shows from Music Box, a separate company which also broadcast on Super Channel until the end of 1989. In September 1993, the Marcucci family sold Super Channel to the US's NBC, which rebranded it as NBC Super Channel. At the same time, logo and graphic set of Videomusic were changed to a new one. In 1994, Videomusic was sold to Vittorio Cecchi Gori, the owner of an Italian channel known as Telemontecarlo. Later in 1996, Videomusic was rebranded as TMC2 (Tele Monte Carlo 2) and its schedules included sports, news and movies. However, the channel also retained music as its most important content and also retained use of the Videomusic logo during music programmes. In 1997, the Videomusic logo disappeared, but music programmes were increased again. The intention of rebranding the channel again as Videomusic failed because Cecchi Gori sold it to Telecom Italia Media, the former co-owner of MTV Italy, which was later closed down forever in favour of a terrestrial retransmission of MTV Italy.

It is also called rice lily, northern rice-root, or (misleadingly) \\"Indian rice\\" or \\"wild rice\\", because of the rice-like bulblets that form around its roots. It is also sometimes known as skunk lily, dirty diaper and outhouse lily because of the flower's unpleasant smell. Yet another vernacular name is \\"chocolate lily\\" because of its brown color, but that term is also applied to Fritillaria biflora (in California) or to the distantly related Arthropodium strictum whose flowers smell of chocolate. Description Fritillaria camschatcensis produces bulbs with several large fleshy scales, similar to those of commercially cultivated garlic. Leaves are lanceolate, up to 10 cm long, borne in whorls along the stem. Stem is up to 60 cm tall, with flowers at the top. Flowers are spreading or nodding (hanging downwards), dark brown, sometimes mottled with yellow.Flora of North America v 26 p 168, Fritillaria camschatcensisKer Gawler, John Bellenden. 1809.

Early days The precursor to the National Broadcasting Service (NBS Radio) was Radio Guardian, established on October 13, 1957, by the Thompson Group, the British owners of the Trinidad Guardian newspaper. On November 1, 1969, the Government under Dr Eric Williams acquired Radio Guardian and Trinidad and Tobago Television (ttt). Radio Guardian was renamed the National Broadcasting Service of Trinidad and Tobago of Trinidad and Tobago (NBS Radio 610). The radio broadcast and production studios continued to be located at 17 Abercromby Street in downtown Port-of- Spain, the capital city. On October 6, 1972, the National Broadcasting Service became the first media company in Trinidad & Tobago to operate an FM stereo station, Radio 100 FM which remained the sole FM stereo signal available until the privately owned Trinidad Broadcasting Company (Radio Trinidad) opened Radio 95 FM Stereo on March 14, 1976. Over the days of the attempted coup d'√©tat on July 27, 1990, led by the Jamaat al-Muslimeen, NBS Radio remained on the air around the clock as the only source of information for listeners in the country, up the eastern Caribbean and indeed, overseas via short-wave signal. International Communications Network In 1995, with the addition of Radio 98.9 FM, catering largely to the urban youth, the National Broadcasting Service (i.e. the radio frequencies) were relocated to the TTT compound at 11A Maraval Road in Port of Spain. Yet a further frequency came on board shortly thereafter - 91.1 FM. This frequency was for a while also used to rebroadcast NBS Radio 610 AM as an FM signal. Under the re-branded International Communications Network (ICN), 91.1 FM eventually changed its format entirely to East Indian programming in 1998. Radio 610 continued to broadcast on the AM dial, but progressively lost its traditional listening audience due to a weakening of the quality of its broadcast signal and a reduction in allocated financial resources to upgrade its equipment and programming. National Broadcasting Network The state media house would undergo yet another name change in 2001 to become the National Broadcasting Network (NBN). Due to financial losses, both radio and TV broadcast entities of NBN ceased operations at midnight on January 15, 2005. An era in radio broadcasting had come to an end. Many well-known radio personalities began or established their careers behind the microphones of Radio Guardian/Radio 610/NBS Radio. Among the many can be listed: Canadian-born Larry Heywood, Frank Hughes, Ed Fung, Leo De Leon, Desmond Bourne, Freddie Wharwood, Ashton Chambers, Bobby Thomas, Carl Redhead, Dik Henderson, Barbara Salandy, Desmond Ahyee, Dave Elcock, Phil Simmons, Brenda & Kenny da Silva, Anthony Harford, Anthony Dennison, Sharon Pitt, Dennis McComie, Ian Eligon and Peter de la Bastide. Caribbean New Media Group In early 2007, a newly created State-owned media company began operations under the name of the Caribbean New Media Group (CNMG), aka simply as \\"C\\". CNMG operates three radio frequencies: Sweet 100 FM, Talk City 91.1 FM and Next Radio 99.1 FM together with a television station CTV, channels 9 & 14.

Smaller stores, sized much like RadioShack, were called Aventure Boutique. At that time, it was once Canada's third-largest consumer electronics retailer after RadioShack and Future Shop. Founded in 1989 by Robert Fragman, it went bankrupt on November 16, 1998. All Adventure Electronics' 143 stores were closed, and 1,271 jobs were lost within 85 stores in Qu√©bec and 58 in Ontario. In an official statement, the leaders of this chain of distribution of electronic products stress that their decision was made inevitable following the loss of the financial support their principal creditors. Scotiabank, by far the principal creditor guaranteed with a credit of almost CAD$36,000,000, had given an opinion of defect one week ago and half. Adventure Electronics, not having been able to find the funds necessary to the re-establishment of its situation, the chain, which was committed in a plan of rectification since the beginning of 1998, had to resign itself to close its 143 stores. This was blamed on rival Future Shop's expansion into Quebec in 1995. With the demise of Adventure Electronics in 1998, this left Future Shop as its only big-box consumer electronics retailer until Best Buy acquired Future Shop in 2001, leading for Best Buy to open locations in Canada for 2002.

TND may occur in infill settings and involve adaptive reuse of existing buildings, but often involves all-new construction on previously undeveloped land. To qualify as a TND, a project should include a range of housing types, a network of well-connected streets and blocks, humane public spaces, and have amenities such as stores, schools, and places of worship within walking distance of residences. TND is limited to the scale of neighborhood or town, and should not be confused with New Urbanism, which encompasses all scales of planning and development, from building to region. TND projects incorporate many different architectural styles and are not exclusively traditional in aesthetic. An example of a TND known for modern style as opposed to neotraditional style is Prospect New Town. An example of neotraditional style is Baxter Village in Fort Mill, SC. History The TND type of development plan, while well known in design circles for quite some time, was originated the US in a legal form in 1990 thru 1992 in the Town of Bedford, New Hampshire. Recognizing that for the design to be implemented zoning laws needed to adapt, an effort was initiated by a group of four individuals (Rick Chellman, (now \\"TND\\" Engineering), Norman Stahl (US Federal Court of Appeals); Andreas Duany and Scott Brooks) who came together to write and then seek the passage of the first \\"TND Ordinance\\". This \\"ordinance\\" put into a traditional zoning form the necessary legalities that prior to its enactment made it legally impossible to gain regulatory approvals in much of the US as the common zoning laws of the period had requirements that mandated suburban design principles directly contrary to the TND design needs. Most importantly was the adaptation away from a single 35 mph design speed on all suburban streets as had been the standard since the 1960s. The TND zoning was ultimately passed in Bedford, New Hampshire, and subsequently copied and/or used as a starting point by many communities thereafter. Creating a regulatory precedent and practical foothold was the original intent of the four-person team. No TND was ever actively undertaken in the originating Town of Bedford NH (although one was approved by the efforts of Stahl, Brooks, Chellman & Duany and it encompassed over 1,000,000 s/f of commercial space, 829 housing units and acres of riverfront park lands) as in the midst of the TND zoning Approvals, a banking crisis took hold and defeated the feasibility for new development at that time.

She was initially assigned to the China Station and then provided landing parties which fought in the Siege of Ladysmith of 1899‚Äì1900 during the Second Boer War. After a lengthy refit, the ship was placed in reserve until 1905 when Powerful became the flagship of the Australia Station. Upon her return home in 1912, she was again reduced to reserve for a brief time before she was reclassified as a training ship. The ship remained in this role until 1929 when she was sold for scrap. Design and description The Powerful-class cruiser was designed to counter the Russian armoured cruiser which had been designed as a long-range commerce raider. This required long range and high speed to catch the Russian ship. The ships displaced at normal load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The ships were powered by a pair of four-cylinder triple- expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by 48 Belleville boilers.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 67 The engines were designed to produce a total of at forced draughtFriedman, p. 335 and gave a maximum speed of . Powerful reached a maximum speed of from during her sea trials. She carried enough coal to give her a range of at and her complement consisted of 894 officers and ratings. The main armament of the Powerful-class cruisers consisted of two Mk VIII guns in single gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Her secondary armament of a dozen Mk I or II guns was arranged in casemates amidships. The end casemates were the first two-storey (guns on the main and upper decks) casemates in the RN. For defence against torpedo boats, sixteen 12-pounder 12-cwt\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. guns and a dozen 3-pounder () Hotchkiss guns were fitted. Two additional 12-pounder 8-cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore. The ships also mounted four submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, a pair on each broadside.Burt, pp. 8, 13 With the exception of the barbettes, which used mild steel, all of the protective plating of the cruisers was Harvey armour. The curved protective deck ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by . The armour of the gun turrets, their barbettes and the casemates was 6 inches thick. The casemates had backs.

Medallion held by the Australian War Memorial - image reference ID Number: REL/09940 The ship was commissioned on 8 June 1897 with Captain the Hon. Hedworth Lambton in command, for service on the China Station. Her departure was delayed so that she could participate in the fleet review commemorating Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee on 26 June and the annual fleet manoeuvres in July. During a full-power run between Wei Hai Wai, China, and Yokohama, Japan, in late July 1898, her stokers mutinied, but she then visited Port Arthur without incident.Burt, p. 12 Ordered home in 1899, Powerful was diverted from the shorter route through the Suez Canal to round the southern tip of Africa in light of rising tensions between the British and the Boers in South Africa. The ship departed Hong Kong, China, on 17 September and arrived at Simonstown on 13 October, two days after the Second Boer War began; Lambton having picked up a half-battalion of the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry from the island of Mauritius on his own initiative. Her sister ship, , commanded by Captain Percy Scott, arrived the following day and Scott improvised field carriages for a pair of 4.7-inch (120 mm) and a pair of Terribles 12-pounder guns. After a request from Lieutenant General George White, commander of the besieged forces at Ladysmith for more long-range artillery, Powerful ferried all four guns to Durban, reaching it on 29 November. Lambton acquired another pair of 12-pounders and led a naval brigade that reached Ladysmith on the last two trains to make it through. After the Relief of Ladysmith at the end of February, the brigade departed the town on 7 March and arrived at Simontown on the 12th. Powerful left Simonstown three days later and arrived at Portsmouth on 11 April.Burt, pp. 12‚Äì13 The enthusiastic response in Britain to the \\"heroes of Ladysmith\\"Illustrated London News and elsewhere was enormous and made Lambton a well-known public figure. Queen Victoria sent a telegram saying, \\"Pray express to the Naval Brigade my deep appreciation of the valuable services they have rendered with their guns.\\"Navy website while a reception and celebratory march through London were among the first events ever recorded on film.The Heroes of Ladysmith Marching Through London and The Queen's Reception to the Heroes of Ladysmith A newspaper described Powerful's return home: Captain Hedworth Lambton The naval brigade paraded for Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 2 May. The RN field gun competition commemorates the participation of Terrible and Powerful in the relief of Ladysmith. In 1921 a new Primary School in Ladysmith was named after Lieutenant Frederick Greville Egerton, a gunnery officer from Powerful who was killed at Ladysmith. =Later career= Powerful paid off on 8 June 1900 at Portsmouth Dockyard and later began a long refit in 1902‚Äì1903Burt, p. 13 During this refit, the RN added four six-inch guns in casemates amidships, although no additional ammunition could be accommodated in the ship.Friedman, p. 234 The ship was briefly commissioned in August 1903 to participate in the annual fleet manoeuvres and was assigned to the reserve on 1 March 1905. In August Captain Lionel Halsey took command of Powerful, Information, dated 12 April 1906, has been received from Captain L. Halsey, His Majesty's ship Powerful, that ... Information, dated 26 July 1906, has been received from Captain L. Halsey, His Majesty's ship Powerful, that ... as flag captain to Sir Wilmot Fawkes as Commander-in-Chief Australia Station. At the time Powerful was commissioning as flagship on the Australia Station. Halsey remained in that post until 1908. At the beginning of December 1905, Powerful was at Fremantle in Western Australia. On 10 October 1907 the ship took aboard a new crew in Colombo, Ceylon. On 3 February 1908 the first trans- Tasman radio transmission was made via Powerful which was in the Tasman Sea. A Sydney Morning Herald journalist, Charles Bean, joined the ship in August 1908 as a special correspondent to report the visit of sixteen American warships ‚Äì the Great White Fleet. Bean wrote a book, With the Flagship in the South (London, 1909), based on his reports and had it published at his own expense. Powerful took aboard a new crew in Colombo on 12 January 1910. In 1911 Powerful visited Auckland, New Zealand to inspect the facilities and Captain Edward Bruen recommended the setting up of a naval stores facility. The ship was ordered home in January 1912 and loaded the body of Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife at Port Said, Egypt, on 9 March en route. After arriving, she was briefly assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron of the Third (Reserve) FleetFriedman, p. 231 before she was reclassified as a Boys Training Ship at Devonport in August 1912. Powerful was assigned as a tender to HMS Impregnable in 1913. She was reassigned to a training role on 23 September and was renamed Impregnable I in November 1919. The ship was paid off on 27 March 1929 and was sold in August 1929 for breaking up.

Henry Scougal (1650‚Äì1678) was a Scottish theologian, minister and author. Henry Scougal was the second son of Patrick Scougal and Margaret Wemys. His father was Bishop of Aberdeen for more than 20 years. From his infancy, Scougal was raised with religion. From his youth, Scougal spent his free hours in reading, meditation and prayer. He especially enjoyed studying the historical passages of the Old Testament. In 1665 Scougal entered King's College, University of Aberdeen, and, after graduation, was promoted to the office of professor of philosophy. In 1672, Scougal was ordained and appointed minister of a church 20 miles from Aberdeen, where he served for one year before returning to take the office of professor of divinity at King's College, where he taught for five years. He spoke Latin, Hebrew, and a few Asian languages. Scougal produced a number of works while a pastor and professor of divinity at King's. His most recognized work, The Life Of God In The Soul Of Man , was originally written to a friend to explain Christianity and give spiritual counsel. This work was almost universally praised by the leaders of the Great Awakening, including George Whitefield, who said he never really understood what true religion was until he had digested Scougal's treatise.

Old Tobacco was upset with the presentation of good and evil together, and he kicked the belts from Helm's hands. At some point, Old Tobacco sold land farther north on the Wabash River, where Wea villages were located. When Lt- Governor Henry Hamilton led an expedition to Vincennes in 1778, he received several complaints from native villages about Old Tobacco.

Background Saint Martin de Porres High School was established in 2004 as a part of the Cristo Rey Network of work-study University-preparatory schools. It accepts only students who cannot afford the tuition, and most are one to two years behind their grade level. . At Saint Martin about one third of the tuition is covered by the educational voucher system in Ohio, but the corporate internship share is greater and allows for a superior level of education. In 2017 Saint Martin responded to the demand to educate more students and undertook a $30 million rebuilding project that would raise its capacity to 525 students. The new building facilitated a student-centered, project-based way of learning. Campus ministry & service There are liturgical celebrations throughout the year which are a part of the spiritual program for all students. In the first three years all students experience a day-long retreat, and in senior year an overnight retreat. Additionally, Kairos and men‚Äôs/women‚Äôs overnight retreats are optional. All students are taught the Christian spirituality of service and participate in service-learning projects in the outside community. Also, special immersion opportunities are offered, as in Cleveland, West Virginia, New Orleans, and El Salvador. Other voluntary projects include the St. Philip Neri Hot meal Program, the Store Front Drop-in Center, United Cerebral Palsy, and St. Clair Superior Development Corporation.

The Tarikh chronicles. however, calls this king Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdullah which is probably the Muslim name of the king after his conversion to Islam in the 12th year of his reign. Later on the title of Dharumavantha (Dharumas) Rasgefaanu or 'the benevolent king' was bestowed upon him. He is also known as the first ruler of the Theemuge Dynasty (not considering King Koimala of the Lunar Dynasty). This name was derived from his house's name, Theemuge, some sourced refer to the royal house as the Maalei Dharikolhu. Though it was being called Theemuge Darikolhu they were descendants of the Buddhist Kings of the Lunar Dynasty or Soma Vansa. The Dharumavantha Miskyii in Mal√©, the Maldives built by and named after its first Muslim King in the 1150s Dhovemi was the son of Henevi Maavaa Kilage (Dhivehi: ﬁÄﬁ¨ﬁÇﬁ¨ﬁàﬁ® ﬁâﬁßﬁàﬁß ﬁÜﬁ®ﬁçﬁ¨ﬁéﬁ¨) the sister of the first King Koimala of all the Maldives. He ruled for 25 years, 12 years as a Buddhist and 13 years after his conversion to Islam. The conversion of Dhovemi, and later the whole Maldivian Kingdom to Islam was accredited by Ibn Batuta, after visiting the Kingdom and staying there for some time, to Abu al Barakat al-Barbari (from Morocco. Later sources claim that a Persian from the Tabriz, called Yusuf Tabrizi was responsible for the conversion of the Maldivian Kingdom to Islam in the year 1153. The newly converted king became the first sultan of the Maldives. The governance of the country is said to have been carried out by the king as advised by Yusuf Tabrizi. King Dhovemi sent emissaries to the different atolls to convert all the inhabitants of the Maldives without any exception to the Muslim faith. The king himself sailed to the island of Nilandhoo in North Nilande Atoll and converted the inhabitants there to Islam. He is also said to have built a mosque there. The conversion of the whole country is said to have taken place on the 2nd day of Rabi'-ul- Akhir 548 AH (1153 AD) on the 17th year of Al-Muqtafi, the Caliph of Baghdad, and since then the Maldives has been a predominantly Islamic country. By the order of the king as his brother Siri Kalo the first Friday mosque of Mal√© was built by Al-Wazir Shanivirazaa. The Dharumavantha Miskyii‚Äîthe oldest mosque in Mal√©‚Äîis said to have been built by King Dhovemi. Sultan Dhovemi was the first to enforce Islamic Sharia law in the Maldives. All traces of idolatry were razed during this period of major transformation of the Maldives and mosques were built on many of the inhabited islands. The sultan is said to have been just, impartial, pious, secular and was beloved by his subjects for his wisdom, kindliness, and generosity, though his actions sometimes indicate otherwise. The death of the Sultan is not recorded, but he is said to have disappeared in 1166 on a voyage to Mecca to perform the Hajj. The Taarikh writes as revived from the Isdhoo loamaafanu: \\"(he said) next Friday a ship will arrive, whereon I shall sail for Makkah. The day named verily a vessel anchored at Mal√©. The Sultan, having performed the Jumu'ah (Friday-noon prayers) at the mosque, hurried to the seashore and embarked in the vessel without attendants or provisions. Forwith the ship passed from sight as suddenly as lightning (and he was not heard from thence)\\" On the disappearance of his uncle, Muthey Kalaminja took over the throne of the Maldives and ruled as the sultan from 1166 according to the Raadhavalhi. The Isdhoo (1195‚Äì1196) and Dhan'bidhoo (1196‚Äì1197) Loamaafaanus (copper plates) give the date as 1176. According to Maldivian historians Mohamed Ibrahim Lutfy and Mohamed Waheed Nadwi, the king learned that a sur nav (a ship which is belonged to Sur of Oman) arrived on its way to Oman completing its journey from the Malay archipelago. He went to Sur by that ship and after completion of his pilgrimage, he got ill on the way back and died and was buried in Salalah, Oman.

It ran on Lisp machines, and was later ported to Lucid Common Lisp with the CLX library, an X Window System (X11) interface for Common Lisp. This version was available on several different UNIX workstations. On KEE, several extensions were offered: * Simkit, a frame-based simulation library * KEEconnection, database connection between the frame system and relational databases In KEE, frames are called units. Units are used for both individual instances and classes. Frames have slots and slots have facets. Facets can describe, for example, a slot's expected values, its working value, or its inheritance rule. Slots can have multiple values. Behavior can be implemented using a message passing model. KEE provides an extensive graphical user interface (GUI) to create, browse, and manipulate frames. KEE also includes a frame-based rule system. In the KEE knowledge base, rules are frames. Both forward chaining and backward chaining inference are available. KEE supports non-monotonic reasoning through the concepts of worlds. Worlds allow providing alternative slot-values of frames. Through an assumption-based truth or reason maintenance system, inconsistencies can be detected and analyzed. ActiveImages allows graphical displays to be attached to slots of Units. Typical examples are buttons, dials, graphs, and histograms. The graphics are also implemented as Units via KEEPictures, a frame-based graphics library.

It was established in 2001, by chairman Prem Reddy, and operates 45 hospitals in 14 states. It is affiliated with the nonprofit Prime Healthcare Foundation. History In 2007, the Los Angeles Times ran a news story that alleged that the policies of Prime HealthCare Services, Inc., resulted in higher-than- average profits for the possible cost of patient care: \\"When Reddy's company, Prime Healthcare Services Inc., takes over a hospital, it typically cancels insurance contracts, allowing the hospital to collect steeply higher reimbursements. It has suspended services ‚Äî such as chemotherapy treatments, mental health care and birthing centers ‚Äî that patients need but aren't lucrative.... On four occasions since 2002, inspectors have found that Prime Healthcare facilities failed to meet minimum federal safety standards, placing their Medicare funding at risk.\\"Daniel Costello, Hospital group rejects system and cashes in, July 8, 2007 In 2008 the State of California and Kaiser Permanente each sued Prime Healthcare over its balance billing practices and Kaiser obtained an injunction preventing Prime from continuing the practice; Prime had cancelled agreements with insurance companies when it acquired hospitals, leaving patients in an out-of-network situation resulting in higher costs, and has been aggressively pursuing patients including sending unpaid costs to collection agencies. This was the first of several suits between Prime and Kaiser. In June 2010 Kaiser sued Prime Healthcare for \\"trapping patients\\" and contended that Prime Healthcare needlessly admitted emergency department patients, rather than transfer them to Kaiser facilities and then sending their insurance companies highly inflated bills. Prime counter-sued Kaiser and the Service Employees International Union, claiming that Kaiser owed it $100 million in unpaid medical claims and that Kaiser and the union conspired to keep Prime out of the market; that suit was dismissed in 2012, and Prime appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case in 2016. In 2015 both sides agreed on dropping their respective lawsuits and resolve them through confidential and binding arbitration. In 2010 Prime Healthcare came under investigation by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the California Department of Justice about concerns over a reported spike in sepsis. The investigation centers around whether the spike in sepsis represents a large public health issue or multimillion-dollar Medicare fraud. Six Prime hospitals ranked in the 99th percentile of U.S. hospitals for sepsis and five were in the 95th percentile. In 2011 Prime Healthcare Service had high rates of kwashiorkor among its elderly patients. At Shasta Regional Medical Center, Prime reported 16.1% of its Medicare patients suffered from kwashiorkor, but California's average for Medicare patients is 0.2%. In 2011 California Watch reported that Prime Healthcare had a practice of transferring high numbers of patients from its emergency department to its hospital beds, specifically with patients on Medicare. Some families describe being trapped by doctors at Prime facilities and were unable to see their own doctor at another facility. Former Prime employees have described an orchestrated campaign of admitting Medicare and Kaiser patients, moving them from the emergency department to a hospital bed, in the interest of changing the fortune of a money-losing hospital. In September 2011, California Attorney General Kamala Harris rejected the approval for the sale of the Victor Valley Global Medical Center in Victorville, California, and stated that the sale would not be in the public interest. In 2012, two executives at Prime Healthcare Services disclosed a patient's chart to multiple media outlets without the patient's express written consent. The release was in response to a California Watch article on Prime Healthcare Services billing practices at Shasta Regional Medical Center, which included claims by a Darlene Courtois about her treatment by Shasta. In this incident, Randall Hempling, the hospital CEO, and Dr. Marcia McCampbell, its chief medical officer, showed up at the offices of the Redding Record Searchlight and successfully convinced the paper's editor not to publish an article, echoing the California Watch claims by reference to Courtois' actual medical records. In 2012, eight of Prime Healthcare Services' hospitals were named among the \\"100 Top Hospitals\\" in the nation by Thomson Reuters. In 2013, Prime Healthcare Services was named as one of the \\"Top 15 Health Systems\\" in the country by Truven Health Analytics. In 2014, Garden City Hospital was sold to Prime Healthcare Services in a deal valued at $76 million. As of that point, Prime Healthcare operated 27 hospitals. The full listing of hospitals and their acquisition year is listed below. In May 2016 US Department of Justice joined a qui tam case against Prime Health Care and its chief executive concerning Medicare fraud. The case was settled in August 2018 for $65 million, resolving the \\"allegations that 14 Prime hospitals in California knowingly submitted false claims to Medicare by admitting patients who required only less costly, outpatient care and by billing for more expensive patient diagnoses than the patients had (a practice known as ‚Äúup-coding‚Äù).\\" In 2016, Becker's Hospital Review listed four Prime Healthcare hospitals in a list of 49 hospitals with the lowest rate of serious complications. Operations Prime operates 45 acute care hospitals in 14 states, serving communities in San Bernardino, San Diego, Los Angeles, Inglewood, Orange County and Shasta County in California, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Rhode Island and Texas.

For example, in the sentence \\"Susan ate an apple\\", Susan is the doer of the eating, so she is an agent; the apple is the item that is eaten, so it is a patient. While most modern linguistic theories make reference to such relations in one form or another, the general term, as well as the terms for specific relations, varies: \\"participant role\\", \\"semantic role\\", and \\"deep case\\" have also been employed with similar sense.  Major thematic relations  The following major thematic relations have been identified:Thomas E. Payne. Summary of Semantic Roles and Grammatical Relations, 19 October 2007 = Agent = : deliberately performs the action (e.g., Bill ate his soup quietly.). = Experiencer = : the entity that receives sensory or emotional input (e.g. Susan heard the song. I cried.). = Stimulus = : entity that prompts sensory or emotional feeling ‚Äì not deliberately (e.g. David detests onions!). = Theme = : undergoes the action but does not change its state (e.g., We believe in one God. I have two children. I put the book on the table. He gave the gun to the police officer.) (Sometimes used interchangeably with patient.) = Patient = : undergoes the action and changes its state (e.g., The falling rocks crushed the car.). (Sometimes used interchangeably with theme.) = Instrument = : used to carry out the action (e.g., Jamie cut the ribbon with a pair of scissors.). = Force or Natural Cause = : mindlessly performs the action (e.g., An avalanche destroyed the ancient temple.). = Location = : where the action occurs (e.g., Johnny and Linda played carelessly in the park. I'll be at Julie's house studying for my test.). = Direction or Goal = : where the action is directed towards (e.g., The caravan continued on toward the distant oasis. He walked to school.). = Recipient = : a special kind of goal associated with verbs expressing a change in ownership, possession (e.g., I sent John the letter. He gave the book to her.). = Source or Origin = : where the action originated (e.g., The rocket was launched from Central Command. She walked away from him.). = Time = : the time at which the action occurs (e.g., The pitcher struck out nine batters today) = Beneficiary = : the entity for whose benefit the action occurs (e.g., I baked Reggie a cake. He built a car for me. I fight for the king.). = Manner = : the way in which an action is carried out (e.g., With great urgency, Tabitha phoned 911.). = Purpose = : the reason for which an action is performed (e.g., Tabitha phoned 911 right away in order to get some help.). = Cause = : what caused the action to occur in the first place; not for what, rather because of what (e.g., Because Clyde was hungry, he ate the cake.). There are not always clear boundaries between these relations. For example, in \\"the hammer broke the window\\", hammer might be labeled an agent (see below), an instrument, a force, or possibly a cause. Nevertheless, some thematic relation labels are more logically plausible than others.  Relationship to case  In many languages, such as Finnish and Hungarian and Turkish, thematic relations may be reflected in the case-marking on the noun. For instance, Hungarian has an instrumental case ending (-val/-vel), which explicitly marks the instrument of a sentence. Languages like English often mark such thematic relations with prepositions.  Conflicting terminologies  The term thematic relation is frequently confused with theta role. Many linguists (particularly generative grammarians) use the terms interchangeably. This is because theta roles are typically named by the most prominent thematic relation that they are associated with. To make matters more confusing, depending upon which theoretical approach one assumes, the grammatical relations of subject and object, etc., are often closely tied to the semantic relations. For example, in the typological tradition agents/actors (or \\"agent-like\\" arguments) frequently overlap with the notion of subject (S). These ideas, when they are used distinctly, can be distinguished as follows: ; Thematic relations : are purely semantic descriptions of the way in which the entities described by the noun phrase are functioning with respect to the meaning of the action described by the verb. A noun may bear more than one thematic relation. Almost every noun phrase bears at least one thematic relation (the exception are expletives). Thematic relations on a noun are identical in sentences that are paraphrases of one another. ; Theta roles : are syntactic structures reflecting positions in the argument structure of the verb they are associated with. A noun may only bear one theta role. Only arguments bear theta roles. Adjuncts do not bear theta roles. ; Grammatical relations : express the surface position (in languages like English) or case (in languages like Latin) that a noun phrase bears in the sentence. Thematic relations concern the nature of the relationship between the meaning of the verb and the meaning of the noun. Theta roles are about the number of arguments that a verb requires (which is a purely syntactic notion). Theta roles are syntactic relations that refers to the semantic thematic relations. For example, take the sentence \\"Reggie gave the kibble to Fergus on Friday.\\" * Thematic relations: Reggie is doing the action so is the agent, but he is also the source of the kibble (note Reggie bears two thematic relations); the kibble is the entity acted upon so it is the patient; Fergus is the direction/goal or recipient of the giving. Friday represents the time of the action. * theta roles: The verb give requires three arguments (see valency). In generative grammar, this is encoded in terms of the number and type of theta roles the verb takes. The theta role is named by the most prominent thematic relation associated with it. So the three required arguments bear the theta roles named the agent (Reggie) the patient (or theme) (the kibble), and goal/recipient (Fergus). On Friday does not receive a theta role from the verb, because it is an adjunct. Note that Reggie bears two thematic relations (Agent and Source), but only one theta role (the argument slot associated with these thematic relations). * grammatical relations: The subject (S) of this sentence is Reggie, the object (O) is the kibble, the indirect object is to Fergus, and on Friday is an oblique.

It offered programs in music, dance, musical theater and recording arts to post-secondary students on a pre- professional level. Its small student body, diverse in age, background and geographical area of origin, pursued immersion studies in music and dance with a jazz emphasis. Some of its students became prepared nationally known performers and teachers. The Hartford Conservatory was one of the nation‚Äôs oldest performing arts schools. It was founded in 1890 at the Hartford Theological Seminary as the School for Church Musicians. Five years later it became the independent Hartford School of Music. In 1934, Truda Kaschmann, a student of Mary Wigman, brought modern dance to the school. It later became known as the Hartford Conservatory and provided not only a community program of weekly instruction in music and dance for all ages and levels, but also an accredited two- and three-year post-secondary immersion program in music, dance, theater and recording arts. The Conservatory was an active part of the musical life of Hartford, and the home of orchestra and vocal groups that formed a major part of the arts scene especially in the first half of the twentieth century. Not only sacred and secular classical music performances, but city premieres of avant-garde works were presented under Conservatory sponsorship in collaboration with the Wadsworth Atheneum‚Äôs Chick Austin and other Hartford notables. In its last thirty years of operation, the school had acquired a jazz and popular music emphasis, teaching jazz dance and music, and offering holiday performances of Duke Ellington‚Äôs Jazz Nutcracker with the New England Jazz Septet and student choreographers, musicians and dancers, and sponsoring master classes with dance artists like Jacques d'Amboise and Savion Glover. The school had a small student body of fewer than one hundred students of varied ages, backgrounds and geographic regions of the country and the world, and a faculty all currently performing in their respective fields. Among the artists that have been part of the Conservatory as students or teachers over the past 120 years are: *Betty Allen, opera singer and former director of Harlem School of the Arts *James Argiro, jazz pianist *choral director Ralph Baldwin *bassist Dezron Douglas *composers Brooke Halpin and Dan-O *pianists Ward Davenny and Grayson Hugh *vocalists Alyson Bristol, and Teresa Stich-Randall *cellists Charles Krane and John Rileyhttp://www.legacy.com/obituaries/hartfordcourant/obituary.aspx?n=john-a- riley&pid;=124073353 *percussionist Alexander Lepak *Cirque du Soleil choreographer Michael Montanaro *dancers Douglas Boulivar, Margarita Froman and Alwin Nikolais The conservatory's board of trustees voted in September 2010 to close in May 2011, the end of the 2010-2011 academic year, allowing current students to graduate.

The higher the fill power, the more air a certain weight of the down can trap, and thus the more insulating ability the down will have. Fill power ranges from about 300 (in¬≥/oz or 175 cm¬≥/g or Lorch 75 mm/30g) for feathers to around 900 (in¬≥/oz or 520 cm¬≥/g or Lorch 225 mm/30g) for the highest quality goose down. The rare and relatively expensive down of certain wild waterfowl species such as the Muscovy duck or Common eider can have higher fill powers than goose down. Higher fill powers are associated with a larger percentage of down clusters and a larger average down cluster size. Measurement Fill power is the most frequently used measure of down quality. It involves measurements taken of a 20g or one-ounce sample of down in a plexiglas cylinder with a weighted piston compressing the down. The test requires controlled temperature, humidity, and preparation of the sample. All other things being equal, bedding or garments made with high fill power down is lighter and more compressible than an equally warm one made with lower quality down. Fill power can be expressed as cubic inches per ounce (in¬≥/oz). For down sleeping bags a lofting power of 600-650 is considered good quality, 700 - 750 is considered very good, and 800 - 950+ is considered excellent. US 2000 norm: cylinder diameter: 241 mm conditioning: steaming +3 to 5 days in a screen box compression cylinder: non- mechanized cylinder of 68,3 grams. Mass of the sample: 1 oz = 28,4 grams. EN norm: cylinder diameter: (289 ¬± 1) mm, conditioning: tumble dry +2‚Äì5 days in a screen box compression cylinder: Lorch machine = mechanized cylinder weighing 94,25 grams, Mass of the sample:(20,0 ¬± 0,1) grams.BS EN 12130:1998 Feather and down - Test methods - Determination of the filling power (massic volume) 750+ fill is quite different from 400 fills. Almost all down commercially available is a secondary product of geese raised for consumption. It would be prohibitively expensive to raise geese for down alone. The geese that are the source for lower fill down are about four months old when they are killed for food. Down from these geese can be carefully sorted, washed, and blended, but it will never loft like really mature down. The 700+ down fill comes from a small number of birds kept for breeding purposes throughout the year. These geese molt naturally in the spring. While their down is loose it is collected by hand. It is very rare and, of course, expensive. The larger individual plumules are what gives the greater loft. The only way to get down of this quality is by careful hand selection which is the major factor in its scarcity. The higher the fill number, the warmer the product is, given that the total mass remains the same. Insulation and weight Depending on the intended application, the highest available fill power may not be necessary. A high fill power will provide more insulating ability for a given weight of down. The warmth of a down comforter depends not only on the fill power, but also on the quantity of fill. So the difference between a comforter with 550 fill power down and a comforter with 700 fill power down is that the 700 fill power down comforter will be lighter for the same warmth rating. High fill powers are most important for weight sensitive applications such as backpacking. Down (or any insulation) provides warmth by trapping a layer of air that separates the cold side from the warm side. A thicker layer of trapped air gives more insulation. This thickness is often called \\"loft.\\" A comforter that uses 550 fill power down, for example, would have to use approximately 40%-50% greater weight of down than a similar item that uses 800 fill power down to provide the same loft. = European sleeping bags = Calculations based on fill power and loft are only approximate. The warmth of sleeping bags may be more accurately compared using European Norm (EN 13537) temperature ratings that are based on realistic independent laboratory tests. The rated temperature (in degrees Celsius) is the lowest comfortable temperature. Often a table with values will be associated indicating safe but potentially not comfortable temperatures. = US sleeping bags = In the United States, sleeping bags are sold by temperature rating (in degrees Fahrenheit). Many US sleeping bag manufacturers use non-standardized methods to establish their temperature comfort ratings which means that ratings from different manufacturers may not be comparable. Some US manufacturers use EN 13537 and others are expected to adopt it in the future.http://www.rei.com/expertadvice/articles/sleeping+bag+backpacking.html Washing and restoring Fill power of down tends to diminish as the down gets dirty and mats. The fill power of a down article can be restored by washing the article in a washing machine with or without detergent (mild) and dried in a home dryer. Tennis balls can be added to help fluff the down. Alternatively, the washing can be skipped and the down article can be placed in the dryer with a damp rag for 10-20 minutes. The idea is to open up the matted down clusters with warm air and moisture.

The main, upright, portion of the house was constructed in 1838 and the wing section was added to the home during the 1860s. It passed through the hands of several owners until it was purchased by Phillip C. Lampert who is responsible for the wildflower covered lawn. The property contains five types of rare plants and is semi-wooded, shaded by 32 trees. The home is a distinct example of Upright and Wing construction, though it retains some elements of the Greek Revival style it was originally designed in. The wing section of the house features a front porch decorated with Gothic Revival and Queen Anne style elements. The house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance in 2005. History The original trio of property owners of the Lampert-Wildflower House site were, according to records, Aaron Whitney, Daniel H. Whitney and Dan Caswell. Seth S. Whitman, originally from Vermont, purchased the property in 1838 and constructed the house where he stayed until 1844. Whitman played an early, active role in the Belvidere community. He became the community's first resident pastor when he was named Reverend of Belvidere's first church, organized on July 24, 1836. He was also the first teacher at the city's first school in 1838, Newton Academy, located a few blocks from the Lampert- Wildflower House. By 1840, Whitman was named Belvidere's first postmaster as well as Boone County's first circuit clerk and recorder. In October 1846, Whitman stepped down as Reverend at the local church because of ill-health. He left the Belvidere area in June 1851 for the Baptist Church in Madison, Wisconsin; Whitman died there on January 2, 1852. From the years 1844 until 1853 the house was owned by several different individuals, including a Colonel Joel E. Walker. In 1853 the house was bought by Ezra May. May stayed in the home until 1886 and it was during his ownership that the house underwent the first of two significant alterations. During the 1860s May added the balloon framed wing section of the home; this section of the house rests upon a brick foundation. May was another prominent Belvidere citizen. May held office as \\"School Director,\\" and \\"Town Trustee,\\" and later owned a flour mill and served as president of a local bank. After 1886 the house was owned by a local educator, about whom little is known today, John Christian Zinzer. Zinzer owned the Lampert-Wildflower House until he sold it to a friend from Forreston, Illinois, Phillip C. Lampert on September 11, 1891. During the Lamperts ownership of the house the Queen Anne detailing was added to the wing section of the house, probably before Phillip Lampert's 1899 death. Lampert was born in Forreston but had moved to Belvidere by 1866. In 1875 Lampert began to teach school in and by 1883 he had been admitted to the Illinois bar. In 1889, after working in a law office in Chicago for a year, Lampert returned to Belvidere to open his own law and abstract office. On April 15, 1891 he married Clara Pape in Madison, Wisconsin. The couple purchased the Lampert- Wildflower House about five months later. Clara Lampert (n√©e Pape) was born and educated in Forreston and graduated high school in 1887, for a short time after that she taught school in Ogle County, Illinois. She began working in Lampert's abstract office in Belvidere a short time after teaching, the law office opened in 1889. After Phillip Lampert died on December 5, 1899 Clara and her daughter Muriel (born March 28, 1892) were left poor. Clara continued her husband's abstract business and on February 2, 1900 she was appointed Deputy Clerk of Boone County, Muriel joined her in that office in 1912. The Lampert-Wildflower House remained in the Lampert family until long after Phillip Lampert's death. Clara Lampert died in 1962 and her daughter Muriel died in 1972. Muriel Lampert left the house to local historians Bessie and Emmett Sullivan; the house stood empty until Bessie Sullivan's death in 1986. In 1986 two men from Grand Prairie, Illinois bought the house and ended up selling it in 1988 to Sherry and Gary Knott-Simon, who set about restoring the home while maintaining its historic character and integrity. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its local and architectural significance as a typical example of Upright and Wing style on August 12, 2005. Architecture The home is a detailed example of Upright and Wing construction, which is a type of non-stylistic, vernacular architecture.Wilks, Angelique N. \\"Lampert-Wildflower House,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, HAARGIS Database, 29 June 2005, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 19 June 2007.Vogeler, Ingolf. \\"Upright and Wing,\\" Department of Geography and Anthropology, University Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Retrieved 19 June 2007. The Lampert-Wildflower House began as a front gabled, Greek Revival style home. In the 1860s, with the addition of the wing section the home was transformed from the Greek Revival style that was popular when it was originally constructed to the Upright and Wing style, though it still displays some Greek Revival elements including the cornice lines on its front gable.McAlester, Virginia & Lee. A Field Guide to American Houses, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc, New York: 1984, pp. 179-195, (). The wing section stretches out from the upright, gabled section of the home and is a two-room, one and half story extension to the original home. The porch which adorns the south elevation of the wing is features Carpenter Gothic detailing. Grounds semi-wooded lawn of the Wildflower House is home to 32 trees and 36 types of plants. The U.S. National Register of Historic Places listing for the Lampert-Wildflower House included the surrounding yard, which maintains its historical integrity. The Lamperts, as naturalists, kept the lawn as a haven for birds and wildflowers. Today, the yard maintains its historic appearance; the front and back yards are planted with wildflowers instead of grass and the whole site is semi-wooded. Most of the 32 trees on the less than site are black walnut and maple. Several endangered plant species are found in the yard as well as prairie and woodland plants of other types. According to Jerry Paulson, with the Natural Land Institute in Rockford, Illinois, there are five kinds of \\"rare\\" plants found in the Wildflower House yard. They are: Canadian violet, ginseng, prairie smoke, bellwort, and yellow violet. Other, common, types of plants found in the yard include, wild grape, purple coneflower, ginger, scilla, ferns, and jack-in- the-pulpit. In total, 36 different types of plants (not including the trees) have been identified on the Lampert-Wildflower lawn.

Travis is an American author and medical practitioner. He is a proponent of the alternative medicine concept of \\"wellness\\", originally proposed in 1961 by Halbert L. Dunn, and has written books on the subject. In the 1970s, Travis founded the first \\"wellness center\\" in California. He originated the Illness‚ÄìWellness Continuum. Early life and education Travis earned his BA from The College of Wooster in 1965, followed by an MD from Tufts University School of Medicine in 1969, and spent six years as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS). At this time, he completed a residency in preventive medicine at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which included a Masters in Public Health, awarded in 1971.  Career  Between 1975 and 1979 he opened and ran the Wellness Resource Center in Mill Valley, California. He closed the Center in 1979 and established Wellness Associates, a non-profit educational corporation. In 2000, he moved to Australia, where he has continued to work in the field of adult and infant wellness. Between 2008-2016, he was an adjunct professor in the Wellness Program at RMIT University (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). He is also a member of the Advisory Board, Integrative Health Studies master's degree, at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. Wellness Travis has cited Halbert L. Dunn's 1961 book, High-Level Wellness as one of the influences which led him to found the Wellness Resource Center. The Center focused on the individual‚Äôs overall state of wellbeing and encouraged ‚Äúself-directed approaches‚Äù to improving health. In 1975, he self-published the Wellness Inventory. This utilized a whole-person model, based on a \\"Wellness Energy System\\" that comprised 12 dimensions, incorporating nutrition, exercise, stress, and the social environment. He first wrote and self-published the Wellness Workbook in 1977. This was later re-published in collaboration with Regina Ryan, and had sold 175,000 copies by 2005. In 1979 he was interviewed by Dan Rather on 60 Minutes, which helped to bring the concept of wellness to national attention. Illness-Wellness Continuum 450pxThe Illness-Wellness Continuum is a graphical illustration of a wellbeing concept first proposed by Travis in 1972. It proposes that wellbeing includes mental and emotional health, as well as the presence or absence of illness. = Concept = Travis believed that a medical approach that relied on the presence or absence of symptoms of disease to demonstrate wellness was insufficient. As shown in the Continuum. The right sidereflects degrees of wellness, while the left indicates degrees of illness. The model has been used to describe how, in the absence of physical disease, an individual can suffer from depression, anxiety or other conditions. He contends that medicine typically treats injuries, disabilities, and symptoms, to bring the individual to a \\"neutral point\\" where there is no longer any visible illness. However, the Wellness Paradigm requires moving the state of wellbeing further along the continuum towards optimal emotional and mental states. The concept assumes that wellbeing is a dynamic rather than a static process. The Illness-Wellness Continuum proposes that individuals can move farther to the right, towards greater health and wellbeing, passing through the stages of awareness, education, and growth. Worsening states of health are reflected by signs, symptoms and disability. In addition, a person's outlook can affect wellness. According to the concept, a positive outlook will enhance health and wellbeing, while a negative outlook will hinder it, independent of the current health status. For example, a person who demonstrates no symptoms of disease, but is constantly complaining, will be facing the left side of the Continuum and away from a state of high-level wellness. Conversely, a person with a disability, but who maintains a positive outlook, will be facing to the right, toward a high level of wellness. It is less important where a person is on the Continuum than the direction they are facing. The Illness-Wellness Continuum has been viewed as promoting preventive treatment, which improves wellbeing before an individual presents with signs or symptoms of illness, as well as educating people to be aware of and avoid risk factors, in order to protect against pathology and premature death. = Historical context = Travis began developing his Continuum in 1972 and it was first published in 1975 in the Wellness Inventory. Since then the concept has been applied to fields such as medicine, nursing, counseling, physical therapy, public health, and organizational development.  Parenting  Since 1991, Travis has focused on attachment parenting, connection parenting, and infant wellbeing in conjunction with Meryn Callander. In 1999 they co-founded the Alliance for Transforming the Lives of Children (aTLC). He has criticized the practice of male infant circumcision, voicing support for the principle of body integrity for young males and challenging the legality of parental decision making in relation to circumcision. Non-government organizations (NGOs) Travis is co-founder of: Coalition for Improving Maternity Services (1996), Alliance for Transforming the Lives of Children (1999), and International Coalition for Genital Integrity (1999).Adjunct Profess John Travis.

She remained active in Venezuelan service until 1968, when she was placed in reserve. She was stricken in 1978 but her ultimate fate is unknown. Career PC-465 was laid down on 19 August 1941 by George Lawley & Son Corp. at Neponset, Massachusetts, launched on 28 March 1942, sponsored by Miss Edna Tamm, and commissioned at Boston on 25 May, as USS PC-465. On her maiden voyage from Boston to Norfolk, Virginia, PC-465 served as an anti- submarine convoy escort. Thence from Norfolk she provided escort service for a second convoy, this time to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In August PC-465 commenced patrol and escort operations between Coco Solo, Panama and Guantanamo Bay. She also called at several Central and South American ports. After a short overhaul at Key West, Florida in June 1943, she resumed convoy escort duties in the Caribbean. PC-465 underwent a major overhaul at Key West during the summer of 1944 preparatory to transit to Pearl Harbor. She reported on 6 December to Commander, Hawaiian Sea Frontier, and immediately commenced inter- island convoy escort duty and patrol. In January and February 1945 she escorted a convoy as far as Canton Island, touching at Palmyra, Fanning, and Christmas Islands in the process. She was next assigned operations out of Enewetak, and from May through August she performed as a convoy escort, patrol, and hunter-killer craft. PC-465 transferred to Kwajalein on 19 August, but served there only briefly before returning to the United States. PC-465 was placed out of commission, in reserve and berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida in 1946. Named Paragould (PC-465) on 15 January 1956, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1960. Paragould was transferred to Venezuela in April 1961 and renamed Pulpo (P-7).

Early history The North Dakota territorial legislature authorized a \\"hospital for the insane\\" in 1883. On May 1, 1885, the State Hospital opened, four years before North Dakota was granted statehood. Along with the University of North Dakota, it is the only institution in North Dakota to predate statehood. The first superintendent was Dr. O. Wellington Archibald, who had previously worked for the US Army at Fort Abraham Lincoln near Mandan, North Dakota. The new institution was praised by authorities of the time. Crowding, however, forced the institution to expand repeatedly, as the number of inmates grew from 106 in 1886 to 819 in 1912, and then to 1,288 by 1920. =Forced sterilization= Along with many other states, North Dakota practiced forced sterilization of its patients. The practice began in 1914, and continued until the 1950s. =Corruption scandal= In June, 1937, Governor Bill Langer - one of North Dakota's most controversial political figures - fired Superintendent J.D. Carr, appointing Henry G. Owen in his place. Owen then fired 75% of the institution's staff, hiring their replacements, a January 30, 1939 report in the Fargo Forum alleged, due to their contributions to the state's governing Non-Partisan League and other political connections. A January 30, 1939 report in the Fargo Forum detailed the results of state special examiner Clyde Duffy's report on his investigation into the political abuses, and their costs both financial and in quality of patient care. Duffy quoted a hospital employee \\"The new employees didn't know how to treat the patients. They called them bad names, cussed and swore at them. Some said they would run away and some did run away.\\" =\\"Dark ages\\"= With a population that exceeded 2,000 in 1940, the Hospital was in a state of crisis. A 1949 Fargo Forum article detailed a report from the American Psychiatric Association complaining of overcrowding, poorly qualified staff, and a general lack of organization. The Legislature responded with an increase in appropriations and an extended period of reform under Dr. R.O. Saxvik, beginning in 1953. The extent of his reforms can be seen in a quote from his 1956 annual report \\"Gone are the cages, strait jackets, leg irons, stern guards, malnutrition, windowless seclusion rooms, unorganized departments, the sixty-hour work week, the naked despondent patient on a back ward, the odors from wards crammed with untidy and helpless men and women, the tuberculosis patients in disorganized treatment areas, the neglected surgical problems and the bedlam of disturbed units\\". =Deinstitutionalization= By the late 1970s, long-term in-patient placement was being downplayed in favor of treating the mentally ill at home through local and regional human service organizations. As a result, the population dipped from its peak in the 1940s of over 2,000, to under 600 in 1974, and around 200 today. =Adding the prison= Several of the hospital's buildings, vacant since deinstitutionalization, were converted to a medium-security prison facility beginning in 1998. Services Currently, the hospital provides: * Adult Psychiatric Services - adult inpatient care for serious mental illnesses. * Transitional Living - a psychiatric \\"halfway house\\". * Chemical Dependency Services - treatment for chemical abuse and addiction, especially when exacerbated by mental illness.

Buck then played professionally for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Canton Bulldogs (1916‚Äì1920) and Green Bay Packers (1921‚Äì1925). Buck served as the head football coach at Carleton College from 1917 to 1919, at Lawrence College in 1923, and as the first head coach at the University of Miami from 1926 to 1928. He was inducted into the Wisconsin State Athletic Hall of Fame in 1956, the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1977, and the University of Wisconsin Athletic Department Hall of Fame in 1991. Early life and college playing career Buck was born on August 7, 1892 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. He attended high school there and was named to Wisconsin's all-state prep team as a center. Playing for the Wisconsin Badgers from 1913 to 1915, he never missed a game and earned three All-Western Conference honors. Coaching and professional playing career After graduating, Buck served as an assistant football coach at Wisconsin in 1916. That year he also starting playing professional football for the Canton Bulldogs. Buck played under an assumed name, Moriarity, because his parents didn't want him playing professionally, especially on Sundays. Buck coached at Wisconsin during the week and for games on Saturdays, then travelled to the site of the Bulldogs game on Sunday. In 1917, Buck was hired as the head football coach and athletic director at Carleton College at age 25. Coaching through World War I and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in three years his teams were 10‚Äì7. He continued to play with Jim Thorpe and the Bulldogs through 1920, the first year of the American Professional Football Association. Thorpe called Buck the greatest lineman he had played with or against. Buck added an extra game in 1920 by playing in the Green Bay Packers' last game of their season. In 1921, the Packers joined the fledgling professional league that would become the National Football League (NFL). Curly Lambeau made Buck the first Packer with a guaranteed salary by paying him $75 per game. That year was the first Green Bay‚ÄìChicago game and it featured the first cheap shot of the storied rivalry. John \\"Tarzan\\" Taylor slugged Buck and broke his nose. Buck played for the Packers through the 1925 season. Besides playing both sides of the line, Buck was the punter and placekicker. From 1922 to 1925, Buck made 24 of 35 extra points and 10 of 28 field goals for a total of 54 points. He led the Packers in scoring in 1923 and threw a touchdown pass in 1924. While playing for the Packers, Buck coached for the Lawrence Vikings, mainly as an assistant, but he was the head coach for the 1923 season. He was also the executive director of the Boy Scouts in Appleton. In 1926, Buck became the first head coach of the Miami Hurricanes football program. Before the team could play its first game, a hurricane destroyed the under- construction stadium and postponed the start of the season. The first team was a freshman squad; they went 8‚Äì0, including two defeats of the University of Havana, one in Miami and one in Havana. During the first two varsity seasons, the Hurricanes were 3‚Äì6‚Äì1 in 1927 and 4‚Äì4‚Äì1 in 1928.

The association was formed in 1905.  History of Soccer in Saskatchewan  Soccer has always played an integral part in Saskatchewan's history. When the European immigrants came to Saskatchewan in the late 1800s, soccer came with them and the first game was played in Prince Albert on June 28, 1889. The greatest indicator of expansion was the formation of the Saskatchewan Soccer Association; The Saskatchewan Soccer Association was formed in Grenfell on Good Friday 1906. A number of exhibition matches against teams from Britain, combined with inner-city matches and the annual match between those of English and those of Scottish heritage in Saskatoon, helped keep soccer in the provincial spotlight. The greatest indicator of the prosperity of Saskatchewan soccer came with a new wave of participation during the 1950s and then in the 1960s with the inclusion of Saskatchewan teams in the newly formed Western Canadian Soccer League. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Saskatchewan soccer experienced continual expansion. This soccer boom was prevalent in a number of communities such as Moose Jaw, Prince Albert and Yorkton; these good times were based on the youth movement, and to a lesser extent, immigration. Adding further variety to Saskatchewan soccer during the 1970s and 1980s was the development of women's soccer. Female teams were established at all age levels and star players emerged. There was also an increase in female involvement off the playing field as more women became involved in coaching, officiating and administering the game. The Regional Training Centre was opened in Saskatoon in 1986 and it has been utilized for a number of teams, including the Western Canada Games team in 1987, the Canada Summer Games team in 1989, the Women's All-Stars and the University of Saskatchewan teams. By the end of the 1980s, soccer was growing in popularity throughout the province. No longer strictly found in the main provincial centers, soccer was played in all sections of the province by a greater variety of players. Towns and cities began to discover the wonderful game of soccer, engaging in a love affair that would continue into the next century. During the 1990s soccer became an all year round sport as multimillion-dollar facilities were built throughout Saskatchewan. Soccer centers could be found in Regina, Saskatoon, Yorkton and Lloydminster. More indoor soccer facilities were built in Warman and Moose Jaw in the first decade of the 21st century, and registrations increased to over 42,000 players participating in the sport of Soccer in 2013. The organization's staff has increased in size to ten full-time employees making it the largest provincial sporting governing body in employees and participants. The SSA operates the Saskatchewan Premier Soccer League: the highest level of amateur soccer competition in the province. Furthermore, it operates, in partnership with Lakeland College and the Meridian Youth Soccer Association (Lloydminster), The Rivers West Centre of Excellence. The SSA is a member organization of the national sport governing body, the Canadian Soccer Association. =Regular members= The following organizations are members of the Saskatchewan Soccer Association http://www.sasksoccer.com/content/our-members *Battlefords Youth Soccer *Battlefords Senior Soccer Association *Briercrest College and Seminary *Broadview Soccer *Canora Soccer *Choiceland Soccer *Dundurn Community Association *Esterhazy Soccer *Estevan Senior Soccer Association *Estevan Youth Soccer Association *Futbol Club Regina *Grenfell Soccer *Humboldt and District Soccer Association *Ile a la Crosse Friendship Centre *JJ Soccer *Kindersley Minor Soccer Association *Kipling Soccer *La Loche Minor Sports *Lac La Ronge Tri-Community Soccer Association *Langenburg United Soccer Organization *Lanigan & District Soccer *Lloydminster & District Soccer Association *Meadow Lake Senior Soccer *Meadow Lake & District Youth Soccer *Melfort Youth Soccer Association *Melville Soccer *Meridian Youth Soccer Association *Montmartre Soccer *Moose Jaw Youth Soccer Association *Moose Mountain Soccer *Moosomin Soccer *Nipawin Indoor Soccer *Nipawin Outdoor Soccer *Oxbow Soccer *Poundmaker Youth Soccer *Prince Albert Youth Soccer Association *Prince Albert Senior Soccer Association *Qu'Appelle Valley Soccer Association *Queen City United Soccer *Redvers Soccer Club *Rocanville Soccer *Rosetown Soccer Association *Saskatoon Adult Soccer Inc *Saskatoon Youth Soccer Inc. *Shaunavon Soccer *Springside Minor Sports *Stoughton Soccer Club *Swift Current Soccer Association *TDSoccer *Tisdale Soccer *Town of Eston *Valley Soccer Association *Vibank Soccer *Watson Minor Sports *Watrous and District Association *Wawota Soccer *Weyburn Soccer Association *Whitewood Soccer *Wolseley Soccer *Wynyard Soccer *Yorkton Soccer Association =Associate members= *Astra Soccer Academy *Phantom Lake Soccer Club, MB *Regina Referees Association *Saskatoon & District Referees Association *University of Regina *University of Saskatchewan  David Newsham Award Winners  The Saskatchewan Soccer Association (SSA) also recognizes participants (coaches, athletes, referees, volunteers, etc.) in sport of soccer on an annual basis.

The family includes the largest of all damselfly species. They specialize in preying on web-building spiders, and breed in phytotelmata, the small bodies of water held by plants such as bromeliads. Range The species traditionally placed in Pseudostigmatidae are all Neotropical. Two range as far as northeastern Mexico: Mecistogaster ornata occurs in Tamaulipas and Pseudostigma aberrans in both Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le√≥n.Westfall and May, 589-596. In 2006, molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the African damselfly Coryphagrion grandis, previously often classified within Megapodagrionidae or in a monotypic family Coryphagrionidae, belonged within family Pseudostigmatidae, close to genus Mecistogaster, as was proposed already ten years before.Bechly, G. (1996). Morphologische Untersuchungen am Fl√ºgelge√§der der rezenten Libellen und deren Stammgruppenvertreter (Insecta; Pterygota; Odonata) unter besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Phylogenetischen Systematik und des Grundplanes der *Odonata. - Petalura, spec. vol. 2: 402 pp. This finding suggests that the family dates back to before the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana.Groenevelda; Fincke, \\"Use of Forest\\", 104. More recent studies, using a denser taxon sampling, have shown this family was paraphyletic, and that C. grandis and New World taxa have rather followed a fantastic ecomorphological convergent evolution. Naiad As with other damselflies, the young, known as naiads, have gills and live in fresh water. The tropical forests where pseudostigmatids live typically have few ponds and lakes, so the water that collects in or on plants is an important habitat. Water-filled tree holes and bromeliad tanks are the most dependable and widespread habitats available to pseudostigmatid naiads, and a majority of species use tree holes. Tree hole species are rarely found in bromeliads and vice versa, probably because bromeliad phytotelmata have much higher oxygen content than those in tree holes. One species apparently specializes in bamboo stems that have filled with water after being breached by other insects. In areas where tree holes are uncommon, naiads of a few species can be found in fallen fruit husks, though these phytotelmata may dry out quickly or be overturned by animals. Fallen palm bracts provide an even more unstable habitat, and no pseudostigmatid naiads have ever been found in them. There remain six species known as adults whose larvae have not yet been identified.Fincke, \\"Use of Forest\\", 105-108. The naiads are top predators in their aquatic habitats, feeding on the larvae of mosquitoes and other flies, tadpoles, and the naiads of their own and other odonate species. Adult Adults are exceptionally large for damselflies, with wingspans as high as 19 cm (7.5 in.) reported for MegaloprepusGroeneveld. and body length up to 13 cm (5.1 in.) for Pseudostigma aberrans.Hedstr√∂m and Sahl√©n. The pterostigma‚Äîa thickened, pigmented cell found on the leading edge of the wing in other odonates‚Äîis either missing or else modified into a pseudostigma of several cells. In some species the pseudostigma is a large colored spot covering most of the tip of the wing.Westfall and May, 587-588. Mary and William Beebe described the appearance of Mecistogaster flying in the rainforest of Guyana: > Spinning through the aisles made by the giant columns of tree-trunks, were > curious translucent pin-wheels .... the wing spots revolved rapidly while > the rest of the wings became a mere gray haze.Quoted in Corbet, 356. Adult lifespans as long as 7 months have been recorded (in Megaloprepus).Fincke, \\"Population Regulation\\", 119. =Foraging= As far as is known, all pseudostigmatids feed on web-building spiders, which they pluck out of their webs. The only recorded exception to this uniform diet is that they occasionally take wrapped prey from a web rather than the spider who wrapped it. Most Odonata are generalist predators; the Pseudostigmatidae may be the only true specialist predators in the order.Corbet, 355-357. Spiders provide a large amount of nutrition per unit of prey, and since empty webs are often taken over by other spiders, a pseudostigmatid that learns web locations may be able to take prey from them again and again.Corbet, 346. They forage in sun flecks and the gaps created by fallen trees, where there is enough light to see spider webs.Fincke, \\"Use of Forest\\", 108. Several species have been observed searching for webs by flying up one side of a tree and down the other side. When they locate one they hover in front of it. To catch a spider they first fly backward, then quickly fly forward to grab it in their forelegs. Then they back away again and perch to consume the spider, removing the legs before eating the body. Though this careful forward-and-back approach minimizes contact with the web, they often preen after eating to remove any strands that do adhere to them. Pseudostigmatids prey on spiders about 3-6mm in body length, avoiding larger ones. They prefer soft-bodied spiders, which can be eaten more quickly. They have never been observed feeding on ground- dwelling spiders, though they do catch web-building spiders that drop to the ground or retreat to a rolled leaf in an attempt to escape. The complex barrier webs that most Nephila spiders build protect them from predation by pseudostigmatids. =Reproduction= Some species mate opportunistically while foraging in light gaps. In others, males briefly hold mating territories in sunny gaps, or defend a large phytotelma and mate with females who lay eggs there.Fincke, \\"Use of Forest\\", 109. All pseudostigmatids have ovipositors capable of cutting into plant tissue to insert eggs, which is the most common mode of oviposition in damselflies. Yet one species, Mecistogaster martinezi, has been observed apparently \\"tossing\\" eggs from its abdomen onto the surface of the water while in flight.

She served on the China Station and provided landing parties and guns which participated in the Siege and Relief of Ladysmith in the Second Boer War in South Africa. A few months later she did much the same thing to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion in China. During this time, her captain was Percy Scott who trained his crew to a high standard in gunnery and had his training methods adopted by the entire Royal Navy. Upon Terribles return home in 1902, she was refitted for two years and was then placed in reserve, sporadically being activated to ferry replacements to China, escort a royal tour to India or participate in fleet manoeuvres. The ship served as an accommodation ship from 1909 to 1913 and was listed for sale in July 1914. The start of the First World War in August, cancelled that and she made one voyage as a troop transport in 1915 before she became a depot ship. Terrible was assigned as a training ship in 1918 before being hulked and converted to suit the role two years later. The ship was sold for scrap in July 1932 and demolished several months later. Design and description The Powerful-class cruiser was designed to counter the Russian armoured cruiser which had been designed as a long-range commerce raider. This required long range and high speed to catch the Russian ship. The ships displaced at normal load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The ships were powered by a pair of four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by 48 Belleville boilers.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 67 The engines were designed to produce a total of using forced draughtFriedman, p. 335 and gave a maximum speed of . Terrible reached a maximum speed of from during her sea trials. She carried enough coal to give her a range of at and her complement consisted of 894 officers and ratings. The main armament of the Powerful-class cruisers consisted of two Mk VIII guns in single gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Her secondary armament of a dozen Mk I or II guns was arranged in casemates amidships. The end casemates were the first two-storey (guns on the main and upper decks) casemates in the RN. For defence against torpedo boats, sixteen 12-pounder 12-cwt\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. guns and a dozen 3-pounder () Hotchkiss guns were fitted. Two additional 12-pounder 8-cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore. The ships also mounted four submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, a pair on each broadside.Burt, pp. 8, 13 With the exception of the barbettes, all of the protective plating of the cruisers was Harvey armour. The curved protective deck ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by . The armour of the gun turrets, their barbettes and the casemates was 6 inches thick. The casemates had backs. Construction and career Terrible at Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review, July 1897 Terrible was laid down by J.& G. Thomson in their Clydebank shipyard on 21 February 1894Friedman, p. 343 and launched on 27 May 1895. The ship arrived at H. M. Dockyard, Portsmouth on 4 June to be fitted out. She was temporarily commissioned in July 1897 to participate in the fleet review commemorating Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Terrible was commissioned for active service by Captain Charles Robinson on 24 March 1898. In May, she ferried the First Lord, George Goschen, and the Civil Lord of the Admiralty, Austen Chamberlain, to Gibraltar and Malta. While transporting relief crews for the Mediterranean Fleet to Malta in December, the ship set a record, taking 121 hours to cover despite heavy weather in the Bay of Biscay.Burt, p. 13 During the Portsmouth to Gibraltar leg she averaged from and from Gibraltar to Malta.Jane, p. 109 On 13 March 1899, a boiler explosion while underway en route to England killed one stoker and injured three others, who were discharged to hospital on arrival.St James's Gazette, mp. 15, March 17, 1899. The inquest identified that the use of salt water caused extensive corrosion and blockages in the boiler tubes, seven of which consequently burst due to overheating.Goschen, G.J. Hansard, 14 April 1899 vol 69 cc1120-3. =Boer War and Boxer Rebellion= Scott's improvised signal light Captain Percy Scott relieved Robinson on 18 September 1899, with orders to take the ship for service on the China Station. Expecting hostilities to break out in South Africa, Scott persuaded the Admiralty to allow him to make passage via the Cape of Good Hope rather than the originally planned Suez Canal route.Scott, p. 91 Terrible arrived at Simonstown on 14 October to find war imminent. With no threat from the sea, Scott set about determining how he might adapt the navy's guns by mounting them on wheels for use on land as to support the army which lacked any long-range artillery and found that its ordinary guns were out-ranged by the Boer artillery. The mountings looked somewhat amateurish, causing the authorities to regard them with considerable suspicion. However, they proved very effective and the role of two of his 4.7-inch (120 mm) guns at the Siege of Ladysmith received quite a bit of publicity.Scott, pp. 95‚Äì105 Terrible arrived at Durban on 6 November and Scott was appointed Military Commandant there the following day. A naval brigade from the Terrible accompanied the Ladysmith relief force, including two 4.7-inch and eighteen 12-pounder guns, and participated in the battles of Colenso (December 1899) and Spion Kop (January 1900) and the relief of Ladysmith on 28 February. Scott also adapted a small searchlight as a signal light mounted on a train to communicate with the besieged force in Ladysmith. After the relief of Ladysmith, Terribles crew rejoined her and she departed Durban on 27 March 1900 en route to China.Burt, p. 14 Natal, South Africa She arrived at Hong Kong on 8 May and Scott mounted four 12-pounders on field carriages later that month, once he became aware that Terrible and her crew would be ordered north to assist British forces against the anti-foreigner movement known as the Boxers. Orders arrived on 15 June that Terrible was to load three companies of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and sail to Taku where she arrived on the 21st. A single 12-pounder gun accompanied the relief force that reached the foreign quarter of Tientsin on 24 June. The other three guns accompanied the expedition that defeated the Chinese forces in the city of Tientsin in mid- July. All four guns were part of the second relief expedition to Peking in August and her crewmen returned to the ship on 7 September. After hostilities ceased Scott focused to working up his ship's gunnery capabilities, devising various training aids, and her crew shot a very respectable score of 78.8% in the 1900 prize firing. Terrible arrived in Hong Kong on 17 December after a typhoon had struck the city, and Scott volunteered to salvage the capsized dredger Canton River. Work began the following month and Scott succeeded two months later. In the Navy's 1901 prize firing Terrible achieved a score of 80%, the best of any ship in the Navy.Burt, p. 14; Scott, pp. 130‚Äì138, 142, 143, 145‚Äì149, 157‚Äì158 In early 1902 Terrible spent several months at Hong Kong, providing relief and condensed water for the dockyard, amid an outbreak of cholera in the city leading to a water famine. In July 1902 Scott received orders to return with his ship to Britain, and after visits to Colombo and Aden, passed via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean where she visited Malta and Gibraltar before she returned to Portsmouth on 19 September.Scott, p. 169 On her return, 700 of her officers and men were hosted to a public dinner in Portsmouth, before she was paid off on 24 October to begin a long refit at Clydebank. During this refit, the RN added four 6-inch guns in casemates amidships, although no additional ammunition could be accommodated in the ship.Friedman, p. 234 =Later career= A drawing of Terrible Terrible recommissioned on 24 June 1904 for special service and took out relief crews to the China Station, returning in December. She was paid off again on the 22nd, but was assigned to the reserve on 3 January 1905. The ship was activated in August to escort the battleship carrying the Prince and Princess of Wales‚Äîthe future King George V and Queen Mary‚Äîduring their tour of India and returned home in early 1906. Terrible served as the temporary flagship of the 6th Cruiser Squadron during the annual manoeuvres in June and July and returned to reserve afterwards. She was reactivated on 7 November to ferry relief crews to China, losing a propeller on the return trip, and finished the voyage on one engine. The ship was refitted from 4 May 1908 to 1 April 1909 and was assigned to the Fourth Division of the Home Fleet upon its completion. Terrible was primarily used as an accommodation ship from 20 July until she was transferred to Pembroke Dock on 6 December 1913. The ship was listed for disposal in July 1914, but this was cancelled when the First World War began shortly afterwards. Terrible was recommissioned in September 1915 to transport troops to the Dardanelles and her 9.2-inch guns were removed. She reached Mudros on 2 October and became a depot ship at Portsmouth upon her return. The ship was assigned as tender to HMS Vernon in January 1918 and then to HMS Fisgard a year later. In September 1919 Terrible was hulked, disarmed and had most of her propulsion machinery removed to convert her into a training ship for engineering apprentices. When the conversion was completed in August 1920, she was renamed Fisgard III. When Fisgard moved to accommodations ashore, the ship was listed for sale in January 1932 and was purchased in July by John Cashmore Ltd. She was towed to Newport, Wales in September and broken up.

Bucklow Hill is at its northeast end, and the Mere crossroads is at the southwest end. The village of Mere is about a mile long and has a varied stock of housing. Most houses are large and have ample gardens leading down to the lake; these are along the inner sides of a triangle formed by the A556, A50 and A5034 roads. Inside the triangle is a lake after which Mere was named, and a golf and country club. Geography The village of Mere has three hotels (The Swan, The Mere Resort and Spa (formerly known as Mere Golf and Country Club) and Mere Court Hotel), a filling station (Orchard Service Station), and two car dealers (Bucklow Hill Garage and Parkside Cars). At Hoo Green (about a kilometre west of Mere) is a hotel called The Kilton, and a post office which also functions as a newsagent and grocer. Knutsford and Altrincham are the nearest towns where a broader range of shops can be found. The Parish Club has facilities for bowling, cricket and snooker. The Mere Golf and Country Club (renamed The Mere Resort and Spa, or known just as The Mere, underwent large development plans which has seen the moving of the members area and pro shop, to accommodate the new hotel rooms) contains some of the top golf players of Cheshire, and houses a fairly competent league 2 tennis team. Transport Motor traffic is however a considerable problem here: on the A556, one of Europe's busiest highways, about 60,000 cars travel through Mere each day. The residents have long petitioned for a bypass and in December 2008, the Government agreed to build one. This is due for completion by 2015. There are two alternative planned routes, both western bypasses on the A556: #Bypassing the Mere junction. #Bypassing the whole of Mere and Bucklow Hill (preferred route). Travel around the village has been made more complicated in recent years by the erection of \\"no right turn\\" signs at the Mere crossroads and on Bucklowhill Lane (runs into Bucklow Hill from Hoo Green, from a little south of west). This restriction will be removed when the bypass is completed. Notable buildings There are two halls in Mere: Mere Old Hall dates from the Regency period and has some decorative features in that style. Mere New Hall was built in 1834 and the architect used the style of the Elizabethan period. It is a brick-built mansion consisting of a medium-sized central block and a long L-shaped wing on one side. The central portion is symmetrical at the rear and has a porte-coch√®re at the front. The interiors are also in the Elizabethan style.Pevsner, N. & Hubbard, E. (1971) Cheshire.

Willhite attended Cordova High School in Rancho Cordova, California, graduating in 1982. He was one of the greatest running backs in California prep history, rushing for 4,901 yards and scoring 72 touchdowns. He was selected into the Sac-Joaquin section Hall of Fame. He was also a great prep sprinter. As a junior in 1981, he won the 200 meters at the California State track meet with a legal wind-aided time of 20.8. As a senior in 1982, he ran 100 meters in 10.5 and had a hand-timed 10.4. In 1981, he was named the California prep athlete of the year (for football and track) and was separately named the California prep football player of the year. After his senior football year, he also earned three national honors. He received the Dial Award as the outstanding scholar-athlete of the year. Making the 1982 Parade Magazine All-American team, he was named the national back of the year, despite very highly recruited Marcus Dupree from Philadelphia, Mississippi, who became a freshman sensation with the Oklahoma Sooners as a true freshman in 1982, being a contender. He was also selected for the Sam B. Nicola Trophy as the National High school Player of the Year by the Touchdown Club of Columbus, Ohio in 1981. In the 1982 Long Beach Press Telegram Best in the West football recruits rankings, he received 10 votes for the best college running back prospect on the West Coast which was the most a recruit could receive. One of most highly recruited prep football players ever out of the State of California in 1981‚Äì1982, he verbally committed to the University of Washington about three weeks before National Signing Day on February 10, 1982, despite the Huskies already having RB Jacque Robinson who as a freshman was the MVP of the 1982 Rose Bowl game in which the Huskies beat Iowa 28‚Äì0. But on signing day, Willhite shocked the college football world and signed with the University of Oregon. Reportedly, he ultimately chose the Ducks over the Huskies because of the Ducks' track program. Willhite severely tore his hamstring during his senior high school track season in 1982 and then suffered further injuries at the University of Oregon during his freshman season, which resulted in him redshirting in 1982. He had an undistinguished college football career. Because of the effect of his injuries, he was switched to fullback where he was used mostly as a blocking back. He became a starter his senior year. During the NFL strike season of 1987, Willhite became a replacement player for the Green Bay Packers. In three games for the Packers, he rushed for 251 yards on 53 carries (4.7 avg), with a long run of 61 yards, but no touchdowns. He is the younger brother of former Denver Broncos' RB Gerald Willhite.

Design and development  The PS.1 was designed by Cesare Pallavicino, the former designer of Breda, after he had moved in 1933 to Caproni. Only two prototypes of the PS.1 were built, given registrations I-FRAN and I-MELO.  Description  The Caproni PS.1 was a four-seat cabin aircraft of metal construction, with cantilever monoplane low wings. The steel-framed fuselage was covered with fabric as were the single-sparred trapezoidal planform foldable wings of steel construction which had rounded tips. The cabin had two side-by-side seats in front with dual controls, and two seats in the rear, under a common multi-part canopy. A retractable conventional landing gear with a rear skid was fitted with the mainwheels protruding from the wing's lower surface when retracted. The radial engine was fitted to the fuselage nose, enclosed by a cowling, driving a two-bladed propeller. Fuel was housed in a 160-litre fuel tank.  Operational history  The second PS.1 after reconstruction as the Caproni Ca.166 Both aircraft took part in the Challenge 1934 contest, flown by Armando Fran√ßois and Ugo Vincenzi. In a technical evaluation, the PS-1 took second place behind the Messerschmitt Bf 108 (the PS-1 and Bf 108 were the only Challenge aircraft with retractable landing gear). The aircraft were completed only shortly before the contest, so their pilots had little time for training. During a short landing trial, Vincenzi damaged his engine and propeller, and he had to withdraw. Armando Fran√ßois completed the contest in 18th place (for 34 starting and 19 finishing crews).Krzy≈ºan, M. (1988), p. 288 The second PS.1, I-MELO, was rebuilt in the late 1930s and redesignated Caproni Ca.166, given the registration I-ALGU.

The treaty was signed in Paris on 11 April by the plenipotentiaries of both sides and ratified by Napoleon on 13 April.Napoleon and the Marshals of the Empire, J. B. Lippincott of Philadelphia, 1855. p. 284 With this treaty, the allies ended Napoleon's rule as emperor of the French and sent him into exile on Elba. Prelude In the War of the Sixth Coalition (1812‚Äì1814), a coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and a number of German states drove Napoleon out of Germany in 1813. In 1814, while the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal invaded France across the Pyrenees, the Russians, Austrians and their allies invaded France across the Rhine and, after the Battle of Paris, entered into negotiations with members of the French government for the abdication of Napoleon. On 31 March, the Coalition issued a declaration to the French nation: On 1 April, Russian Emperor Alexander I addressed the French S√©nat conservateur in person and laid out similar terms as were in the previous day's declaration. As a gesture of good will, he announced that 150,000 French prisoners of war who had been held by the Russians since the French invasion of Russia, two years earlier, would be released immediately. The next day, the Senate agreed to the Coalition's terms and passed a resolution deposing Napoleon.Alison. pp. 187‚Äì188 They also passed a decree dated 5 April, justifying their actions, and ending: > ...the senate declares and decrees as follows :‚Äî1. Napoleon Buonaparte is > cast down from the throne, and the right of succession in his family is > abolished. 2. The French people and army are absolved from their oath of > fidelity to him. 3. The present decree shall be transmitted to the > departments and armies, and proclaimed immediately in all the quarters of > the capital.Alison p. 190 On 3 April 1814, word reached Napoleon, who was at the Palace of Fontainebleau, that the French Senate had dethroned him. As the Coalition forces had made public their position that their quarrel was with Napoleon and not the French people, he called their bluff and abdicated in favour of his son, with the Empress Marie-Louise as regent. Three plenipotentiaries took this conditional abdication to the Coalition sovereigns: While the plenipotentiaries were travelling to deliver their message, Napoleon heard that Auguste Marmont had placed his corps in a hopeless position and that their surrender was inevitable. The Coalition sovereigns were in no mood to compromise and rejected Napoleon's offer. Emperor Alexander stated: With the rejection of his conditional abdication and no military option left to him, Napoleon bowed to the inevitable: Over the next few days, with Napoleon's reign over France now at an end, the formal treaty was negotiated and signed by the plenipotentiaries in Paris on 11 April and ratified by Napoleon on 13 April. Terms Fontainebleau where the Treaty was signed The agreement contained a total of 21 articles. Based on the most significant terms of the accord, Napoleon was stripped of his powers as ruler of the French Empire, but both Napoleon and Marie-Louise were permitted to preserve their respective titles as emperor and empress.Alphonse de Lamartine, p. 202. (Article II) Their Majesties the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress Marie-Louise, will preserve their titles and qualities to enjoy them during their lives. The mother, brothers, sisters nephews and nieces of the Emperor shall equally preserve, wherever they may be sojourning, the titles of princes of his family. Moreover, all of Napoleon's successors and family members were prohibited from attaining power in France.Alphonse de Lamartine, p. 202. (Article I) His Majesty the Emperor Napoleon renounces, for himself, his successors and descendants as well as for each of the members of his family, all right of sovereignty and domination, as well as over the French Empire and the kingdom of Italy as over all other countries. The treaty also established the island of Elba as a separate principality to be ruled by Napoleon.Alphonse de Lamartine, p. 203. (Article III) The island of Elba, adopted by his Majesty the Emperor Napoleon, for the place of his residence, shall form, during his life, a separate principality, which shall be possessed by him in all sovereignty and property. Elba's sovereignty and flag were guaranteed recognition by foreign powers in the accord, but only France was allowed to assimilate the island.Alphonse de Lamartine, p. 203. (Article IV) All the allied powers engage themselves to employ their good offices cause to be respected, by the Barbary powers, the flag and territory of the island of Elba, so that in its relations with the Barbary powers it should be assimilated to France. In another tenet of the agreement, the Duchy of Parma, the Duchy of Placentia and the Duchy of Guastalla were ceded to Empress Marie- Louise. Moreover, a direct male descendant of Empress Marie-Louise would be known as the Prince of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla.Alphonse de Lamartine, p. 203. (Article V) The Duchies of Parma, of Placentia, and of Guastalla shall be given, in all property and sovereignty, to her Majesty the Empress Marie- Louise. They shall pass to her son and to his descendants in direct line. The prince her son shall take, from this time, the title of Prince of Parma, of Placentia, and of Guastalla. In other parts of the treaty, Empress Josephine's annual income was reduced to 1,000,000 francsAlphonse de Lamartine, p. 204. (Article VII) The annual income of the Empress Josephine shall be reduced to 1,000,000f., in domains, or in inscriptions on the grand livre of France. She shall continue to enjoy, in full property, all her estates real and personal, and may dispose of them in conformity with the laws of France. and Napoleon had to surrender all of his estates in France to the French crown,Alphonse de Lamartine, p. 204. (Article IX) The estates which his Majesty the Emperor Napoleon possesses in France, whether of extraordinary or private domain, shall revert to the crown. Of the sums funded by the Emperor Napoleon, whether in the grand livre, or in the Bank of France, whether in canal shares, or in any other manner, and which his Majesty gives up to the crown, there shall be reserved a capital which shall not exceed 2,000,000f., to be disposed of in gratuities in favour of persons who shall be inscribed in the list that shall be signed by the Emperor Napoleon, and which shall be remitted to the French government. ‚Äì \\"Bonaparte offered the pope a pension of two millions of francs, being the precise sum he himself was thus obliged to accept!\\" (de Bourrienne p. 362 and submit all crown jewels to France.Alphonse de Lamartine, p. 204.

British opposition \\"The Rise and Fall of Napoleon\\", a cartoon drawn by Johann Michael Voltz following the Treaty of Fontainebleau; on the lower side is seen the map of Elba. The British position was that the French nation was in a state of rebellion and that Napoleon was a usurper. Castlereagh explained that he would not sign on behalf of the king of the United Kingdom because to do so would recognise the legitimacy of Napoleon as emperor of the French and that to exile him to an island over which he had sovereignty, only a short distance from France and Italy, both of which had strong Jacobin factions, could easily lead to further conflict.John Abbott The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte, Kessinger Publishing, 2005, , p. 481 Theft of document In 2005, two Americans, former history professor John William Rooney (74) and Marshall Lawrence Pierce (44), were charged by a French court for stealing a copy of the Treaty of Fontainebleau from the French National Archives between 1974 and 1988. The theft came to light in 1996, when a curator of the French National Archives discovered that Pierce had put the document up for sale at Sotheby's. Rooney and Pierce pleaded guilty in the United States and were fined ($1,000 for Rooney and $10,000 for Pierce). However, they were not extradited to France to stand trial there. The copy of the treaty and a number of other documents (including letters from King Louis XVIII of France) that were checked out from the French National Archives by Rooney and Pierce were returned to France by the United States in 2002.Paris to try US citizens 24 November 2005 JS Online: Former professor may be doomed to repeat history: Man was already convicted in U.S. for taking historic treaty, now France wants to try him too (Author: Megan Twohey; Date: 18 January 2006) See also * Treaty of Chaumont (1814) ‚Äì a rejected cease-fire offered by the Sixth Coalition * Treaty of Paris (1814) ‚Äì peace treaty at the end of the end of the Wars of the Sixth Coalition * Convention of St. Cloud (1815) ‚Äì surrender of Paris at the end of the Waterloo Campaign * Treaty of Paris (1815) ‚Äì peace treaty after the Waterloo Campaign Notes References * John Stevens Cabot Abbott.

History The station was established in 1771 and was the 10th of 11 light stations established prior to the American Revolution. The first tower was a shingled wooden structure with an iron lantern and copper roof. Its light source was three copper oil lamps. The first tower was replaced in 1804 by an octagonal wooden tower approximately east of the 1771 tower. In 1851, twenty years after the establishment of Whaleback Lighthouse, the tower was shortened to . Three years later, in 1854, the tower was fitted with a Fourth (4th) Order Fresnel lens. In 1878, a new cast-iron, brick-lined lighthouse tower was erected on the same foundation as the 1804 tower. When the new tower was completed, the surrounding remains of the 1804 tower were removed. The current light is a fixed green signal that is visible for . The light is made green by an acrylic cylinder that surrounds the lens. Other structures at the light station that are still standing are the 1903 oil house (restored in 2004) and the 1872 keeper's house (currently United States Coast Guard offices). The lighthouse was added to National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Friends of Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouses Founded in 2001, the Friends of Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouses are a chapter of the American Lighthouse Foundation (ALF). The mission of the Friends is to work for the preservation of Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouse and associated structures, as well as to gather and preserve the history of the important historic site and to share these resources with the public. The United States Coast Guard owns Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouse and still maintains the active aids to navigation equipment. The group is licensed through ALF to care for the tower, oil house, and wooden walkway. As of November 2008, the Friends are also responsible for Whaleback Lighthouse, and altered the chapter name to reflect this. Ghost Hunters investigation In October 2008, the Ghost Hunters team of Jason Hawes, Grant Wilson, and others investigated possible paranormal activity at the lighthouse, keeper's house, and Fort Constitution. The episode aired December 10, 2008, on the Sci Fi Channel. This investigation came almost two years after the independent TV show Scared! filmed at the Portsmouth Lighthouse. The two episodes of the two different shows both featured investigations of the lighthouse as well as the keeper's house and the nearby Fort Constitution. Jeremy D'Entremont of the Friends of Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouse provided on- and off-screen history for both shows.

Biography Kenichiro Arai, also known as AraKen, is a second term graduate of √öltimo Drag√≥n's Toryumon Japan group, and has been a mainstay on the roster ever since. He participated in FMW before joining Toryumon. He debuted as a heel, but turned face within the year and remained so for over a decade.http://dgusa.tv/featurearticles7.htm He is known for his love of the Hanshin Tigers baseball team, and for his very hard head. Arai frequently no-sells attacks to the head when wrestling. Earlier in his career, he played an alcoholic, and would spit beer in his opponent's faces, but this aspect of his character was quietly dropped. Arai started as a midcarder, but gradually lost card position over the years, until he was fighting mainly in opening matches and rarely winning. However, his career changed for the better when he joined the cram school based stable Tozawa-juku in early 2007. It saw the first ever alteration of his character, and he formed a tag team with Taku Iwasa that gave his career a resurgence. The two won the Open the Twin Gate championship from inaugural champions Naruki Doi and Masato Yoshino on February 8, 2008, successfully retaining the titles twice before dropping them to Ryo Saito and Susumu Yokosuka on May 5. However, he would find championship success again the following month, for on June 28, he - along with Iwasa and newest Tozawa-juku member Shinobu - would capture the Open the Triangle Gate Titles from Shingo Takagi, Yamato and Gamma. Unfortunately for them, they lost the titles in their first defense on July 12, losing them to Yasushi Kanda, Yamato and Gamma. On November 16, he, Iwasa & Tozawa fought the Triangle Gate champions Masaaki Mochizuki, Don Fujii and Magnitude Kishiwada for the titles, but they had agreed to end Tozawa-juku if they lost. Arai ended up being pinned, bringing the stable to an end, and he and the others were given a graduation ceremony. On January 18, 2009, Arai shocked everyone when he joined the heel group Real Hazard, turning heel for the first time since 1998. It came about when he came to the ring seemingly to assist Yasushi Kanda from suffering a beatdown from Real Hazard, after he lost a Real Hazard banishment match to Gamma, but instead, he joined the group, and then he joined Kanda and the other group members in beating down and ousting Gamma. He adopted a violent fight style and also re-introduced the alcoholic aspect of his character, carrying large amounts of alcohol bottles to the ring, which he used in his matches. Since joining Real Hazard, Arai's career has been relatively uneventful. He has won matches on a semi-regular basis, usually via a low blow followed by a flash pinfall, but he has not been in title contention. In January 2010, during Real Hazard's disagreement on whether to fight clean matches or continue to cheat, Arai continued to team with the \\"cheat\\" side but didn't take a strong position on the issue. When the clean fight side of Genki Horiguchi, Susumu Yokosuka and K-ness left Real Hazard on February 10, Arai stayed with the heels, and with them became one of the founding members of the new Deep Drunkers stable a couple of weeks later. Since the formation of the Deep Drunkers, Arai has been mostly absent from cards and losing matches in short order when he does appear. On October 13, 2010, the Deep Drunkers lost a six-man tag team match to World-1 and were as a result forced to split up. However, following the match World-1 member Naruki Doi turned on his stablemates and joined the former Deep Drunkers and Takuya Sugawara to form a new heel group. They however decided that Arai was not needed in the new group and kicked him out.

The disease was first described in the 1960s in the New England Journal of Medicine. It is caused by contagious infection with human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which more commonly causes oral herpes (cold sores). Another strain, HSV-2 usually causes genital herpes, although the strains are very similar and either can cause herpes in any location. While the disease is commonly passed through normal human contact, it is strongly associated with contact sports‚Äîoutbreaks in sporting clubs being relatively common. Other names for the disease are herpes rugbiorum or \\"scrumpox\\" (after rugby football), \\"wrestler's herpes\\" or \\"mat pox\\" (after wrestling). In one of the largest outbreaks ever among high- school wrestlers at a four-week intensive training camp, HSV was identified in 60 of 175 wrestlers. Lesions were on the head in 73 percent of the wrestlers, the extremities in 42 percent, and the trunk in 28 percent. Physical symptoms sometimes recur in the skin. Previous adolescent HSV-1 seroconversion would preclude most herpes gladiatorum, but being that stress and trauma are recognized triggers, such a person would be likely to infect others. Signs and symptoms Herpes gladiatorum is characterized by a rash with clusters of sometimes painful fluid-filled blisters, often on the neck, chest, face, stomach, and legs. The infection is often accompanied by lymphadenopathy (enlargement of the lymph nodes), fever, sore throat, and headache. Often, the accompanying symptoms are much more of an inconvenience than the actual skin blisters and rash. Each blister contains infectious virus particles (virions). Close contact, particularly abrasive contact as found in contact sports, causes the infected blisters to burst and pass the infection along. Autoinoculation (self-infection) can occur through self-contact, leading to infection at multiple sites on the body. Herpes gladiatorum symptoms may last up to a few weeks, and if they occur during the first outbreak, they can be more pronounced. In recurrences of the ailment, symptoms are milder, even if lesions still tend to occur. With recurrent infections scabs may form at 3 days yet the lesions are still considered infectious up until 6.4 days after starting oral antiviral medications. Healing takes place without leaving scars. It is possible that the condition evolves asymptomatically and sores are never present. Causes Herpes gladiatorum is a skin infection primarily caused by the herpes simplex virus. The virus infects the cells in the epidermal layer of the skin. The initial viral replication occurs at the entry site in the skin or mucous membrane.eMedicine Portal. \\"Herpes Simplex details\\" 2010-02-10. The infections caused by a HSV Type 1 virus may be primary or recurrent.American academy of dermatology. \\"Herpes Simplex explained\\" 2010-02-10. Studies show that even though most of the individuals who are exposed to the virus get infected, only 10% from them will develop sores as well. These types of sores appear within two to twenty days after exposure and usually do not last longer than ten days. Primary infections usually heal completely without leaving scars but the virus that caused the infection in the first place remains in the body in a latent state. This is the reason why most of the people experience recurrences even after the condition is taken care of. The virus moves to the nerve cells from where it can reactivate. Once the condition has recurred, it is normally a mild infection. The infection may be triggered by several external factors such as sun exposure or trauma. Infection with either type of the HSV viruses occurs in the following way: First, the virus comes in contact with damaged skin, and then it goes to the nuclei of the cells and reproduces or replicates.Herpes Simplex Virus infection and recurrence About health online portal. Retrieved on 2010-02-10 The blisters and ulcers formed on the skin are a result of the destruction of infected cells. In its latent form, the virus does not reproduce or replicate until recurrence is triggered by different factors. Pathophysiology Herpes gladiatorum is transmitted by direct contact with skin lesions caused by a herpes simplex virus. This is the main reason why the condition is often found in wrestlers. It is believed that the virus may be transmitted through infected wrestlers' mats, but this is still subject of research since the virus cannot live long enough outside the body in order to be able to cause an infection. Direct contact with an infected person or infected secretions is undoubtedly the main way in which this virus may be transmitted. It is also believed that wearing abrasive clothing may increase the chances to get infected with this type of virus. Shirts made of polyester and cotton may cause frictions that lead to small breaks in the skin which makes it easier to contract the infection. Studies in which athletes were wearing 100% cotton shirts showed a decrease in the number of herpes gladiatorum cases. The spread is facilitated when a sore is present but it can happen in its absence as well. The patients may know that the virus is present on the skin when they experience the so-called \\"prodromal symptoms\\". These include itching or tingling on the skin, right before the blisters or lesions appear. The virus may spread since the first symptoms appear until lesions are completely healed. The incubation period is situated between 3 and 14 days. This means that a person will experience the symptoms within 14 days after he or she contracted the infection. This type of virus may be transmitted even if the symptoms are not yet present. Some individuals can have very mild symptoms that may not be taken as herpes symptoms and the patient may not recognize them. The asymptomatic transmission occurs when the infection is spread between outbreaks.Herpes detailed analysis eMedicine. 2010-02-10 =Similar infections= Herpes gladiatorum is only caused by the herpes simplex virus. Shingles, also manifesting as skin rashes with blisters, is caused by a different virus, herpes zoster. Other agents may cause skin infections, for example ringworm is primarily due to the fungal dermatophyte, T. tonsurans. Impetigo, cellulitis, folliculitis and carbuncles are usually due to Staphylococcus aureus or Beta-hemolytic streptococcus bacteria. These less common forms can be potentially more serious. Anti-viral treatments will not have an effect in non-viral cases. Bacterial infections must be treated with antibiotics and fungal infections with anti-fungal medication. Prevention Key measures to prevent outbreaks of the disease are maintaining hygiene standards and using screening to exclude persons with suspicious infections from engaging in contact sports. A skin check performed before practice or competition takes place can identify individuals who should be evaluated, and if necessary treated by a healthcare professional. In certain situations, i.e. participating in wrestling camps, consider placing participants on valacyclovir 1GM daily for the duration of camp. 10-year study has shown 89.5% reduction in outbreaks and probable prevention of contracting the virus. Medication must be started 5 days before participation to ensure proper concentrations exist.Anderson BJ, McGuire D, Reed, M, Foster M, Ortiz D. Prophylactic Valacyclovir to Prevent Outbreaks of Primary Herpes Gladiatorum at a 28-day camp: a 10-year review.Clin J Sports Med. 2016. 26:4: 272‚Äì8. Treatment Herpes outbreaks should be treated with antiviral medications like Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, or Famcyclovir, each of which is available in tablet form. Oral antiviral medication is often used as a prophylactic to suppress or prevent outbreaks from occurring. The recommended dosage for suppression therapy for recurrent outbreaks is 1,000 mg of valacyclovir once a day or 400 mg Acyclovir taken twice a day. In addition to preventing outbreaks, these medications greatly reduce the chance of infecting someone while the patient is not having an outbreak. Often, people have regular outbreaks of anywhere from 1 to 10 times per year, but stress (because the virus lies next to the nerve cells), or a weakened immune system due to a temporary or permanent illness can also spark outbreaks. Some people become infected but fail to ever have a single outbreak, although they remain carriers of the virus and can pass the disease on to an uninfected person through asymptomatic shedding (when the virus is active on the skin but rashes or blisters do not appear). The use of antiviral medications has been shown to be effective in preventing acquisition of the herpes virus. Specific usage of these agents focus on wrestling camps where intense contact between individuals occur on a daily basis over several weeks. They have also been used for large outbreaks during seasonal competition, but further research needs to be performed to verify efficacy.

It was founded by scientists, and is now managed by Uruguay's Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs and Education.  History  Uruguay has been associated with Antarctic activities since 1776, when the country first issued licenses for fishing in the southern seas. In 1916, it was involved in the attempt of rescue of Sir Ernest Shackleton and the barquentine Endurance crew reaching Elephant Island in August that year, in an expedition by T/N Ruperto Elechiribehety of the Uruguayan Navy. Starting at and continuing after IGY, Navy officers participated in Argentine and British expeditions to Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. The Uruguayan Antarctic Institute itself was founded in Montevideo, Uruguay on by Professor Julio C√©sar Musso, who was leading a team of Antarctic fellows. Professor Musso became the first UAI President. By , the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute was integrated under the Ministry of Defense, getting then more resources with the aim to disseminate and carry out scientific investigations in the Antarctic regions under the 60¬∞ South Latitude. In the 1990s the Uruguayan Air Force trained pilots for inland operations on ice by cooperation with Germany. In 1975 the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute was created under MoD, making the nation's Antarctic presence - through an expeditionary program begun in 1984 - a government matter. It has an annual budget specially assigned by the Ministry of Economy and it is ruled by an Interministerial Council, with delegates of Ministry of Defense, Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education and Culture.  Structure  The Uruguayan Antarctic Institute works in different areas with specialized and experienced personnel in Directions according to the fields and needs. Totalling 58 people, these are: * Scientific Coordination Direction * General Secretariat * Plans & Operations * Logistics * Finances and Personnel The Scientific Coordination Direction organize and evaluates, scientific research programs within the Universities, institutes and research communities to fulfill the needs, requirements and recommendations promoted by Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). It also promotes research programs in SCAR areas of interest with international cooperation and participation with national Institutes and universities. The Plans & Operations Direction deals with Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) affairs in AIROPS, SHIPOPS, TRAINET. Station crews are trained and selected following COMNAP guidelines, and other implemented plans such as Medevac, Oil Spill contingencies, waste management, working together with Logistics, which is also involved in COMNAP ‚Äì SCALOP for those activities. An important issue is the development of environmental monitoring programs according to the manuals issued by COMNAP. The UAI actively participates in all events of Antarctic community. By national legislation, it ratifies all protocols and agreements caring about science and environment. See also * Uruguayan Antarctica, a proposed territory.

Named after Hunterdon County, New Jersey, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. USS LST-838 was laid down on 20 September 1944 at Ambridge, Pennsylvania by the American Bridge Company; launched on 8 November 1944; sponsored by Miss Margaret Foster; and commissioned on 4 December 1944 with Lieutenant Allan T. Larkins, Jr., in command. Service history =World War II, 1944-1946= After shakedown off Florida, LST-838 loaded heavy construction equipment at New Orleans and departed on 5 January 1945. Loading troops and additional cargo at Pearl Harbor, the landing ship sailed to the Mariana Islands, arriving at Guam on 4 March. She unloaded her cargo, then steamed to Saipan where she loaded equipment and embarked units of the 130th Naval Construction Battalion for the invasion of Okinawa, sailing on 25 March. LST-838 arrived off the southern Okinawa beaches on 1 April. Despite determined efforts by the enemy, Allied forces succeeded in securing a beachhead. On D-Day, after was struck by a suicide plane, LST-838 recovered 79 survivors from the heavily damaged ship. The landing ship stood off the coast of Okinawa until 13 April when she approached Green Beach to discharge Seabees and construction equipment. The following day during one of the many raids she shot down a Japanese aircraft. Departing Okinawa on the 16th, LST-838 arrived at Ulithi six days later. For the rest of the war she transported men and equipment throughout the South and Western Pacific Islands. Following the end of the war, LST-838 moved men and equipment to Japan for occupation duties. She remained in the Far East until 7 November, when she departed Yokohama for Guam; then embarked 544 Army veterans and steamed to the United States, arriving at San Francisco on 23 December. She was decommissioned on 7 August 1946 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. On 1 July 1955 she was redesignated USS Hunterdon County (LST-838). =Vietnam War, 1966-1974= Recommissioned on 10 September 1966 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, Hunterdon County saw extensive service during the Vietnam War, operating as part of Operation Game Warden, a brown- water navy effort to keep the rivers free of Viet Cong (VC) infiltration. Four LST were recommissioned to support river patrol operations with the intent of keeping three ships on-station at any one time supporting a River Division of 10 River Patrol Boats (PBR), a Detachment of 2 UH-1 Helicopter Gunships from HC-1 and a SEAL Platoon. The ship not on-station was undergoing ship repairs in the Western Pacific. Hunterdon County reported on-station to CTF 116 on 20 March 1967 and operated as a Patrol Craft Tender (AGP) for the next 49 months on the rivers of the Mekong Delta.CWO3 John Trolinger, Instructor/Boat Captain/Patrol Leader On 12 May 1970, it was the first U.S. Navy commissioned vessel to enter Cambodia,The Amphibian, Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, Vol 22, No. 12, 19 Jun 1970 rearming and refueling helicopters that belonged to the U.S. Army and Navy, as well as the South Vietnamese air force.

He was responsible for raising and leading the 1st Canadian Regiment of the Continental Army during the invasion of Canada, and continued to serve in the war until 1781. He retired to Saratoga, New York, where he served as a state legislator and raised a family of five children. Early life James Livingston was born March 27, 1747, in Albany, New York, to Johanes \\"John\\" Livingston (1709‚Äì1791) and Catherine Ten Broeck (1715‚Äì1801). His siblings included Margerita Livingston (1742‚Äì1820), Dirck Livingston (1744‚Äì1784), Janet Livingston (1751‚Äì1823), Abraham Livingston (1753‚Äì1802), Catherine (n√©e Livingston) Willard (1755‚Äì1827), and Maria Livingston (1761‚Äì1839). His paternal grandfather was Robert Livingston the Younger (1663‚Äì1725), a nephew of Robert Livingston the Elder. His paternal grandmother, Margareta Schuyler (b. 1682), was the daughter of Pieter Schuyler (1657‚Äì1724), the first Mayor of Albany. They were all members of the prominent Livingston family. His maternal grandparents were Dirck Ten Broeck (1686‚Äì1751) and Margarita Cuyler (1682‚Äì1783). His mother, the great-granddaughter of Dirck Wesselse Ten Broeck (1638‚Äì1717), was the sister of General Abraham Ten Broeck (1734‚Äì1810), who married Elizabeth Van Rensselaer, and Christina Ten Broeck (1718‚Äì1801), who married Philip Livingston (1716‚Äì1778), and Sara Ten Broeck, who married Johannes Ten Eyck. Among his many cousins was Dirck Ten Broeck (1765‚Äì1832), the Speaker of the New York State Assembly from 1798 to 1800. By 1765, the family had moved to Montreal. American Revolutionary War Congress Own Regiment Livingston was living in Chambly, working as a grain merchant, when the invasion of Quebec began in September 1775. As early as August, he had been in contact with General Philip Schuyler, mostly through the efforts of John Brown, an American spy. On August 18, he sent a messenger to Schuyler at Fort Ticonderoga, presumably with information on British military readiness at Fort Chambly and Fort Saint-Jean; however, this messenger destroyed the message, fearing he might be captured with it. General Richard Montgomery (who was married to one of Livingston's relatives), who was in command of Ticonderoga at the time, sent John Brown back to Livingston. On the 28th, they sent word back to Montgomery with news that spurred him to begin the invasion: the British had almost completed ships capable of threatening the American naval superiority on Lake Champlain. Up to, and then also following, the arrival of the American forces at √éle aux Noix in early September, Livingston was active in the Chambly area, raising local support for the Americans. On September 15, he reported to Schuyler that militia under his control had cut off Fort Chambly from communication with Montreal, and that Brown and Ethan Allen were raising additional troops and guarding the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence River. Forces under his command, numbering about 200, participated in the capture of Fort Chambly on October 18, along with militia under Brown's command. On November 20, Montgomery made him a colonel in the Continental Army, and gave him command of the 1st Canadian Regiment, consisting mainly of the troops he had recruited. This regiment then served at the battle of Quebec in December 1775, and the ensuing retreat. They later saw action in the Saratoga campaign, including the relief of the siege of Fort Stanwix in August 1777, both Battles of Saratoga, and the Battle of Rhode Island. Livingston was in command of Verplanck's Point on the Hudson River in September 1780, when he played a crucial role in the unmasking of Benedict Arnold's treachery. While on guard duty, his troops fired on the British sloop of war Vulture, forcing that vessel to retreat southwards. This ship had brought British Major John Andr√© to meet with General Arnold. After being driven off in his approach by water, he attempted to re-approach on land by portaging in civilian clothing.Livingston (1910), p. 523 He was captured with incriminating papers in his possession. Andr√© was hanged as a spy, and Arnold, knowing that his plot had been discovered, managed to escape to the British lines. Livingston retired from the Continental Army on January 1, 1781. In recognition of his service, he was granted of landMorrison near where Tyre, New York is today. In 1801, Congress awarded him another of land near the modern location of Columbus, Ohio.Ohio Historical Society (1904), p. 496 =Post-war= After the war, Livingston settled in Saratoga. From July 1, 1783 until June 30, 1788, he served in the New York State Assembly beginning with the 7th Legislature and continuing through the 8th, 9th, 10th, and finally, the 11th New York State Legislature as a Federalist. He served again from July 1, 1789 until June 30, 1791 during the 13th and 14th Legislatures. Livingston served as a member of the first Board of Regents of the University of New York from April 13, 1787 until his resignation in 1797. He was replaced by Abraham Van Vechten. Personal life In 1772, Livingston had married Elizabeth Simpson (1750‚Äì1800), an immigrant from Cork, Ireland living in Montreal.Ohio Historical Society (1904), p. 494 Together, they had at least two sons and three daughters, including: * Elizabeth Livingston (1773‚Äì1818), who married Peter Gerrit Smith (1768‚Äì1837), a business partner of John Jacob Astor. * James Livingston (1775‚Äì1851), who married Patty Martha Griffith * Richard Montgomery Livingston (1787‚Äì1838), who was named after the general in his memory and who married Sarah Livingston (1792‚Äì1873). * Edward Chinn Livingston (1783‚Äì1843), early settler of Columbus, Ohio, who married Martha Nelson (1785‚Äì1855) * Margaret Livingston (1785‚Äì1871), who married Daniel Cady (1773‚Äì1859). * Catharine Ten Broeck Livingston (1789‚Äì1874), who married Henry Brevoort Henry (1786‚Äì1818).

The ship was built as MY Hermes by W. F. Stone of Oakland, California, in 1914, for the Williams- Diamond Company, agents for the trading company Jaluit-Gesellschaft of Hamburg, Germany. Service history =World War I, 1917-1919= The German vessel was in port at Honolulu when the United States entered World War I in April 1917. Taken over by the Navy by Executive Order, she was commissioned at Honolulu as USS Hermes on 1 April 1918, Lt. John T. Diggs in command. Originally intended as a submarine patrol vessel, Hermes performed this duty out of Honolulu during the summer of 1918. On 31 August she sailed on a cruise among the islands northwest of Hawaii, including Laysan and Wake, to search for survivors of shipwrecks, signs of enemy activity, and to conduct a survey on wildlife and particularly birds for the Biological Survey Commission, Washington. After returning to Pearl Harbor on 2 October, she continued as a patrol craft. =Inter-war activities, 1919-1941= Hermes was ordered decommissioned on 16 January 1919 and placed at the disposal of the Hawaiian territorial government for use as a tender to leper colonies. When the territorial government decided they could not afford her upkeep, Hermes was turned over to the Pacific Air Detachment, whom she served as a store ship and general auxiliary craft. Hermes was sold on 21 October 1926 to the Lanikai Fish Company and renamed Lanikai, and sold again in 1929 to the Hawaiian Sea Products Company. Laid up in 1931, the yacht was sold in 1933 to Northrup Castle of Honolulu, and sold in 1936 to Harry W. Crosby of Seattle, Washington. In 1937 she was sold to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios for use in making the film The Hurricane, starring Jon Hall and Dorothy Lamour. Following completion of the film she was used as the MGM yacht until sold on 6 April 1939 to E. M. Grimm of the Luzon Stevedoring Company of Manila, Philippines. =World War II= Operations in the Philippines, 1941-1942 Lanikai was taken into the United States Navy at Cavite Navy Yard, Philippine Islands, under charter from Luzon Stevedoring Co., on 5 December 1941, and commissioned the same day with Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) Kemp Tolley in command. Late in November 1941 it became apparent to the American Government that Japanese forces were tactically deposed for major operations in Southeast Asia, but their precise target was unknown. A large convoy was steaming south from the Formosa Straits, and it was hoped that learning the destination of these ships might reveal Japan's intentions. On 2 December, President Roosevelt ordered, through Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Harold R. Stark, that the Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Thomas C. Hart \\"charter three small vessels to form a defensive information patrol... to observe and report by radio Japanese movements in the west China Sea and Gulf of Siam.\\" Lanikai was one of the small ships chartered to learn of Japan's intentions. Fitted out at Cavite, with the greatest dispatch, the schooner lay at the entrance of Manila Bay in the early hours of 8 December (7 December east of the International Date Line) awaiting daylight to thread her way through the dangerous minefields which guarded the harbor. Tolley's orders read: \\"Patrol off the entrance of Cam Ranh Bay and report the direction taken by the Japanese Fleet when it emerges.\\" However, at 0300 word of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor arrived with orders to return to Manila. In ensuing weeks, the schooner patrolled the approaches to Manila Bay and served as dispatch vessel within the harbor. On 10 December she survived the devastating Japanese air raid which destroyed Cavite Navy Yard. On Christmas Day, she assisted in the evacuation of Manila, carrying Army officers and equipment to Corregidor. Escape to Australia, 1941-1942 As a result of plans and actions of Lt. Comdr. Charles Adair, flag lieutenant to Admiral Hart, approval was obtained for Lanikai to attempt to escape to the Netherlands East Indies. On the evening of 26 December, carrying as passengers one Dutch and three American officers, Lanikai, with her Filipino crew, got underway from Mariveles Bay, Luzon, \\"destination unknown\\". Heading generally south, hiding in friendly coves during daylight, and traveling principally at night, the schooner sailed from island to island as Japanese forces spread across the East Indies with explosive speed. Storms covered her as she crossed the three large stretches of open water which lay between Luzon and Australia, and offered no coves for daylight concealment. When, as happened all too often, enemy aircraft approached the lightly armed schooner, they were preoccupied for the most part, with bigger game; but, at Surabaya, Java, on 3 February 1942, three Japanese bombs straddled the schooner so close aboard that Lanikai crewmen put off in a skiff to pick up a large quantity of stunned fish. In late February, under full sail despite heavy seas, Lanikai headed due south from Tjilatjap, Java. This course was taken to avoid enemy forces which might be searching the direct route from Java to Darwin, Australia. On 1 March, while about 200 miles east of Christmas Island, a large Japanese task force was sighted on the port bow. Evasive action by Lanikai was successful. On 18 March, 82 days after departing Mariveles, the schooner arrived at Fremantle, Western Australia. Service in Australia, 1942-1945 After replenishment and repairs, she got underway, on 4 April, to cruise along the northwest Australian coast and search for possible Japanese coast watchers. Lt. Comdr. Adair relieved Lt Comdr. Tolley of command of the vessel on 27 April and continued the search into mid-May. Lanikai was decommissioned at Fremantle on 22 August, and was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy in which she served on harbor defense throughout the war. =Fate, 1945-1947= At the end of the war, Lanikai was sent back to the Philippines, and returned to her previous owner at Manila in 1946, but the owner refused to accept her in such poor condition. While undergoing repair at Subic Bay, the US naval base north of Manila, Lanikai sank during a typhoon in 1947. In 2003 the wreck of the vessel was found in Subic Bay just off Nabasan Wharf and artifacts later salvaged.

History  Cemetery chapel The village was first mentioned in 1455 as Mistrzowicz[e]. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality dropped from 675 in 1880 to 665 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (98%-100%) accompanied by a few Czech-speaking (at most 8 or 1.2% in 1910) and German-speaking people (at most 5 or 0.8% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Protestants (67%), followed by Roman Catholics (32%) and Jews (7 or 1%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria- Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship.

The name Ocotepec means ‚Äúon the hill of the ocotes, or Montezuma pines.‚Äù It is located only minutes from the center of Cuernavaca on the highway that leads to Tepoztl√°n. The community is divided into four neighborhoods based on the major churches in town, which is an organization left over from the colonial period. The four neighborhoods are Candelaria, Dolores, Ramos, and Santa Cruz, each with its own patron saint and feast day. This organization is part of the reason why this community has managed to maintain more ancient traditions, a number of which date from the pre-Hispanic period. Ocotepec is one of the most traditional communities in the municipality of Cuernavaca. On the main road through town, there are dozens of stores specializing in handcrafted clay, stone and wood pieces, as well as rustic furniture. Among these shops are restaurants and food stalls specializing in barbacoa and cecina. History Ocotepec was established in the 15th century as part of the Aztec Empire. Ocotepec was separate from Cuauhn√°huac, but it became part of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca of Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1529. Construction of the convent of the Divino Salvador was begun in 1536 and finished in 1592. Today Ocotepec is one of 48 localities of Cuernavaca. On May 22, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, eleven confirmed cases of the virus were reported in Ocotepec. Neighborhoods There are four barrios (neighborhoods) in Ocotepec, each with its own festival: * Candelaria (Tlaneui), founded by Tlahuicas; Virgin of Candelaria honored on February 2. *Dolores (Culhuakan), founded by Acolhuas; Our Lady of Sorrows honored on September 15. *Ramos (Tlakopan), founded by Tecpanecas. *Santa Cruz (Xalxokotepeazola) founded 1970. Church of the Divino Salvador The main church of the town is the Church of the Divino Salvador (Divine Savior). This church was begun in 1532 and finished in 1592. It has a single nave, a barrel vault roof, buttresses on the sides, battlements and a bell tower on the south side. The facade of the church is of Baroque style and sculpted out of lime mortar. To the side there are arches of the cloister for the monastery, but this was never finished. The complex faces a large atrium that is surrounded by a wall, which has battlements and a cornerstone with the date of the church‚Äôs consecration. A plaque on the wall of the church states that during the Siege of Cuernavaca (1914) of the Mexican Revolution, the bells of the church were melted down to make ammunition for the Zapatistas. The bell tower was severely damaged during the September 19, 2017 Puebla earthquake.https://www.elsoldecuernavaca.com.mx/local/callaron-las-campanas- de-la-parroquia-de-ocotepec-2010964.html Retrieved Dec 18, 2018. Town cemetery One of the brightly painted tombs at the cemetery The other, and perhaps more important, cultural attraction here is the town‚Äôs cemetery. It is filled with very traditional examples of tomb construction in modern Mexico. Most of the tombs here are covered over with small-scale churches, cathedrals and houses, which are brightly painted and/or tiled. Here preparations for one of the biggest days of the year are made, Dia de los Muertos. Dia de los Muertos D√≠a de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a particularly important event in this town. Most of the traditions here are similar to those in the rest of Mexico with masses, altars to the deceased and visits to the cemetery, but Ocotepec has some unique observances as well. Commemoration of the dead actually begins on the feast day of Saint Luke on October 18. Much of the time between the 18th and the 31st is taken up with a novena in honor of the deceased. The most notable difference is the ‚Äúofrenda nueva‚Äù or literally new offering. Altars are especially created to honor those who have died in the past year. These tend to be the most elaborate, decorated with food and drink the deceased enjoyed in life as well as sugar skulls, numerous flowers, such as Mexican marigolds and candles. In the case of children, toys and sweets are laid on the altar. On many altars here, representations of the four elements, earth, water, fire and air are represented by bread, water, candles and crepe paper respectively. There also can be four candles in the form of a cross oriented to the four cardinal directions. This serves to bless the path that deceased is supposed to take as they rejoin the living on this day. The centerpiece of an ofrenda nueva altar is an effigy of the newly deceased made from fruit, bread and or vegetables, dressed in new clothing and shoes bought for the occasion. Those houses which have a ‚Äúnew offering‚Äù that year can be identified by a path of marigold petals that extend from the altar to the sidewalk outside the house. This serves not only as a signal for the recently deceased, as to find his or her way, but it also is an invitation to the living to come into the home and admire the nueva ofrenda altar. Such visitors are greeted with bread, ‚Äúponche‚Äù (a hot spiced fruit drink), coffee and tamales. In return visitor light candles and/or leave flowers on the altar. Another tradition that is particular to this town is a procession that happens on the nights of October 31 and November 1. The whole village files into the cemetery on both nights, carrying offerings and food to eat while seated alongside the tombs. Church bells ring on the night of October 31 to announce the arriving Day of Deceased Children, November 1. On this morning, the graveyard is visited and decorated with multicolored flowers and a Mass is said in honor of those children who have passed on. Later that night, church bells ring again to announce Day of the Dead, November 2, when visits are again made and another Mass is said, this time for adults.

He emigrated to Canada and has been working at the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal (IRCM) since 1974. He is the director of the laboratory of Biochemical Neuroendocrinology. He discovered and cloned seven (PC1, PC2, PC4, PC5, PC7, SKI-1 and PCSK9) of the nine known enzymes belonging to the convertase family. During this period, he also greatly contributed to demonstrating that the proteolysis by the proprotein convertases is a wide mechanism that also concerns ‚Äúnon- neuropeptide‚Äù proteins such as growth factors, Œ±-integrins, receptors, enzymes, membrane-bound transcription factors, and bacterial and viral proteins. In 2003, he discovered PCSK9 and showed that point mutations in the PCSK9 gene cause dominant familial hypercholesterolemia, likely because of a gain of function related to the ability of PCSK9 to enhance the degradation of cell surface receptors, such as the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). He has since worked on the elucidation of the functions and mechanisms of action of PCSK9 both in cells and in vivo, and is developing specific PCSK9 inhibitors.

The collision problem most often refers to the 2-to-1 version: given n even and a function f:\\\\,\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}\\\\rightarrow\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}, we are promised that f is either 1-to-1 or 2-to-1. We are only allowed to make queries about the value of f(i) for any i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}.

The subculture emerged in North-West England as northern soul event attendees began to take more interest in the modern funk and jazz funk sounds of artists such as Lonnie Liston Smith and Roy Ayers, instead of the obscure 1960s soul records that characterized the northern soul scene. There was simultaneous development of the subculture at nightclubs in South East England, such as The Goldmine in Canvey Island and The Royalty in Southgate. DJs involved with the soulboy scene included Chris Hill, Robbie Vincent, Froggy, Greg Edwards, Pete Tong ( George Power )and Chris Bangs. Caister Soul Weekenders became one of the main features of the scene, and still exist today. The Casual subculture that emerged in the 1980s was heavily influenced by the soulboys, including the sideways fringed wedge hairstyle and Lois jeans Although the soulboy scene was huge by the early 1980s, it was centred on American funk acts and was largely based in decentralised provincial areas on the South East; therefore it received far less media coverage than other youth cultures of the same period, notably Punk and New Romanticism. After 1983, the Soul Boy scene in South East England metamorphosed into the Rare groove scene of the mid 1980s, which only finally died out with the UK Acid House boom of 1988.

A lifelong resident of Indianapolis, Indiana, Ruth Lilly is estimated to have given away nearly $800 million of her inheritance during her lifetime, mostly in support of the arts, education, health, and environmental causes in Indianapolis and in Indiana. Lilly made major direct donations to organizations in addition to gifts made through the Lilly Endowment, her family's private foundation, and in conjunction with the Ruth Lilly Philanthropic Foundation, the charitable organization established in her name in 2002. Both of these foundations continue Lilly's legacy of charitable support. Lilly's major gifts include those to the Chicago-based Poetry Foundation, Americans for the Arts in Washington, D.C., and Indiana University, especially its programs and buildings on the Indiana University‚ÄìPurdue University Indianapolis campus. Early life and family Ruth Lilly, the daughter of Ruth (n√©e Brinkmeyer) and Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., was born on August 2, 1915, in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was eldest of their two children. Her younger brother, Josiah Kirby (J.K. or Joe) Lilly III, was born on December 25, 1916. Her great grandfather, Colonel Eli Lilly, founded Eli Lilly and Company in 1876. Her grandfather, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., succeeded Colonel Lilly as president of the pharmaceutical company in 1898 and became chairman of the board in 1932. Her father, Josiah K. Lilly Jr., joined the family firm in 1914 and served as its president (1948‚Äì53) and chairman of the board (1953‚Äì66). Her brother, J. K. (Joe) III, joined the family business in 1939, but resigned from the firm in 1948 and did not succeed his father as president. Ruth became the last surviving great-grandchild of Colonel Lilly in 1995 and heiress to the Lilly family's pharmaceutical fortune. Her mother died in 1965, her father died in 1966, and her brother died in 1995. Lilly's cousin, Evelyn Lilly Lutz, the only surviving child of Evelyn (Fortune) and Eli Lilly Jr., died in 1970.Madison, pp. 26, 258. Ruth and her brother grew up in Indianapolis, where she remained a lifelong resident. She graduated from Indianapolis's Tudor Hall School, a private school for girls, in 1933.After the merger of Tudor Hall with Park School for Boys in 1970, it became known as Park Tudor School. See She also attended Herron School of Art in Indianapolis. In December 1932, while Lilly was a teen, her parents purchased a French chateau-style home that became known as Oldfields. Lilly and her brother donated Oldfields and its landscaped grounds to the Art Association of Indianapolis in 1967. In 1941 Lilly married Guernsey van Riper Jr., an author and the son of an Indianapolis advertising executive. They divorced in 1981 and had no children. Lilly lived a life of quiet seclusion. News sources, including the Indianapolis Star, reported that Lilly suffered from depression for much of her life. It was also reported that when Lilly was in her early seventies her health improved after she began taking Prozac, an antidepressant her family's pharmaceutical firm brought to market in 1988. Philanthropist During her lifetime it is estimated that Lilly donated more than $800 million, an estimated $10 million annually, to charitable causes and arts organizations. Most of the recipients of her gifts were based in Indiana and her hometown of Indianapolis. Lilly's philanthropy fell into four major areas of interest: education, literature and the arts, disease prevention and suppression, and health education and health care. Rather than focusing on a specific area, she gave directly to a variety of causes, although she had a particular interest in poetry. In 2002 alone, when Lilly's estate was valued at more than $1 billion, she donated \\"nearly $500 million to charitable and arts-related groups.\\"\\"Eli Lilly & Co. Heiress Dies at 94\\" from The Associated Press in The donations included an unexpected pledge valued at $100 million, mostly in Eli Lilly and Company stock, to Chicago-based Poetry magazine in November 2002. At the time of Lilly's headline-making donation, the monthly publication had a circulation of approximately 12,000 and its non-profit publisher, the Modern Poetry Association, had a four-person staff and an annual budget of less than $700,000. Soon afterwards the association was renamed the Poetry Foundation. The same year that Lilly made the major donation to Poetry magazine, she also pledged two other large gifts. One valued at $120 million was made to Americans for the Arts, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. Lilly also made a gift valued at $150 million to the Lilly Endowment, Inc., the Lilly family's charitable foundation. Poetry had been one of Lilly's long time interests. She enjoyed reading poetry and had written it since the mid-1930s. Although Lilly had submitted her poems to Poetry magazine for years, they were never accepted for publication. However, the rejections did not deter her support of the magazine and its publisher. Lilly had made previous donations to the magazine before her major donation in 2002. The Poetry Foundation's Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize of $100,000 has been awarded annually since 1986 to honor a living U.S. poet whose lifetime accomplishments warrant extraordinary recognition. In addition, her donations have endowed annual fellowships to young poets since 1989. The awards have expanded from a single fellowship (until 1995) to two fellowships (1996 to 2007) and five in 2008. The Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowship was renamed the Ruth Lilly and Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Poetry Fellowships after receipt of a gift from the Dorothy Sargen Rosenberg Memorial fund in 2013. The fellowships are open to all U.S. poets between the age of twenty-one and thirty-one. The amount of the individual fellowships has increased from $15,000 to $25,800. Over the years Lilly made donations to numerous colleges and universities, most of them located in Indiana, including Indiana University, DePauw University, Butler University, and Wabash College, among others. Some of these donations were for specific purposes. For example, Lilly provided funding to Anderson University for a campus wellness center and to Franklin College for a leadership center. Numerous Indianapolis charities were also recipients of her generosity, especially those related to health care. These included Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children, and Saint Vincent Indianapolis Hospital, as well as the Brain Injury Association of Indiana. The Ruth Lilly Center for Health Education in Indianapolis was funded with her gift in 1987. Lilly was also a patron of various Indianapolis arts organizations, including the Indianapolis Art Center, Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, Indiana Repertory Theatre, and the city's ballet and opera organizations, among others. She was a member of the Indianapolis Museum of Art's board of trustees. Later years In her final years, Lilly's health began to decline and physical limitations confined her to a wheelchair. In 2006 the court established a niece and nephew as her legal guardians with responsibility for making decisions concerning her estate, which was estimated at more than $1 billion at that time. Lilly spent the last years of her life at Twin Oaks, an Indianapolis home that was once owned by Isabel and Lyman S. Ayres II, the grandson of Lyman S. Ayres, founder of the L. S. Ayres and Company department stores. Lilly's parents purchased the Ayres's Colonial Revival-style home on Kessler Boulevard in 1955 and renovated it in a European style. In 1963 the Lilly family purchased adjoining property to expand the estate to . Although Lilly's parents never made Twin Oaks their home, it served as Ruth's residence until her death in 2009 and as a gathering place for the family. Death and legacy Lilly died of heart failure on December 30, 2009. A service in celebration of her life was held on January 11, 2010, at Indianapolis's Christ Church Cathedral, where she had been a member. Her remains are interred at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. Lilly was survived by six nieces and nephews and their descendants. The Ruth Lilly Philanthropic Foundation, established in 2002 to continue her legacy of philanthropy, received additional funding from her estate, as did the Lilly Endowment, Inc., the Lilly family's charitable foundation. News reports at the time of her death in 2009 estimated the value of the additional funding provided her charitable foundation would range from $125 million to $150 million. Her donation to the Lilly Endowment was funded by two trusts, one of them valued at an estimated at $95 million as of June 30, 2008. The other trust, valued at $200 million in 2008, benefits the Indianapolis Museum of Art, which is located on the grounds of Oldfields, her family's former estate. The IMA manages Oldfields, which is open to the public, as a part of the art museum. Lilly's special interest in poetry continues through the direct donation she made to the Poetry Foundation. Her funding sponsors an annual poetry prize and fellowships to aspiring poets, as well as new programs and initiative the Poetry Foundation established since its receipt of her bequest. Lilly's legacy also continues through the major gifts and grants she provided to colleges and universities. Indiana University received additional gifts from Lilly's estate and her related philanthropic foundations. In April 2011 IU received two generous gifts valued at an estimated $10.7 million from her estate. Approximately $8 million was donated to its Center on Philanthropy and approximately $2.7 million to the Herron School of Art and Design. IU's Center on Philanthropy, which is located on the IUPUI campus, was renamed the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy in 2013, following receipt of funding from the Lilly Endowment in 2012. See also: Herron planned to use the Lilly funding it received to expand its graduate-degree offerings and other art programs, and to complete Eskenazi Hall, which houses the art and design school on the IUPUI campus. Another of Lilly's contributions to IU was an endowed chair of poetry. Several other Indiana colleges and universities received gifts from Lilly, including Anderson University, Butler University, DePauw University, Franklin College, Hanover College, Marian University, the University of Indianapolis, and Wabash College, among others. She also made donations to Duke University in North Carolina and Tufts University in Massachusetts. Lilly has also been a benefactor to several Indianapolis-area schools, including Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School, Cathedral High School, Lutheran High School, The Orchard School, and Park Tudor School. Lilly's philanthropic legacy also reflects her interests in health and environmental issues. Her donations have supported the work of several Indianapolis-area hospitals, including IU Health Methodist Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children, and Saint Vincent Indianapolis Hospital. Lilly donated $1 million to the Crossroads Rehabilitation Center in Indianapolis for its Assistive Technology Center. She also supported the Brain Injury Association of Indiana, The Nature Conservancy, the Hoosier Environment Council, the Indianapolis Chapter of the American Red Cross, The Salvation Army, the United Way of Central Indiana, and various children's and family support agencies in Indiana and in the Indianapolis area. In 2014 the Ruth Lilly Health Education Center announced that it would merge into Marian University's School of Education and Exercise Science in early 2015 to remain financially sustainable. Many arts-related organizations have been recipients of her support, especially the Americans for the Arts, to whom she pledged a gift valued at $120 million in 2002. Most of the other arts groups have been located in Indiana and in Indianapolis: the Indianapolis Art Center, Indiana Symphony Orchestra, Indianapolis's ballet and opera troupes, the Indiana Repertory Theatre, Young Audiences of Indiana, WFYI Public Broadcasting, Conner Prairie, the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, and the Indianapolis Zoo. Lilly was also contributor to the Heritage Museums and Gardens in Sandwich, Massachusetts, which her brother established as a tribute to their father. Twin Oaks, Lilly's Indianapolis home, is privately owned and under lease to the Indiana Historical Society, who manages the site and uses it as a hospitality center. IHS's president and CEO serves as resident curator.

The Carbon-Lehigh Intermediate Unit IU21 History =Beginnings= The Allentown Public School District (ASD) dates to 1928. The Commonwealth Education Act of 1824 provided that children of those families unable to pay for private instruction were to be provided education at the expense of the county. Records of the borough of Northampton (Allentown) and the townships of Salisbury paid a total of $421.71 for the education of children in 1828. In 1833, Northampton Borough paid $434.77. Both boys and girls from families in the lower income brackets were permitted to attend any one of the approved private schools in the borough.Allentown PA Bicentennial - Lehigh Country Sesquicentennial 1962 Commemorative Book, pp 113-115 The next step in the ASD's development happened in 1834 with the Model Public School Act. The act provided that school districts, with the approval of the local electorate, could be formally established for the education of all boys and girls, regardless of race or creed. A meeting of the citizens of Northampton on 12 September called for a referendum of the school issue to establish a local school district. The referendum was passed by the voters, 137 to 1. During the initial period following passage of the referendum, all boys and girls of the borough attended the privately run schools in Northampton. Tuition was $10 to $20 per term per student, depending on the number of subjects taken. The tuition was paid for by the school district. On 16 April 1836, an act of the Pennsylvania Legislature changed the name of the community from Northampton to ‚Äì Allentown.Allentown, 1762‚Äì1987, a 225 Year history, Volume II, 1921‚Äì1987, Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987. The first public school building began with the purchase of a tract of land at Walnut and Union Streets, along Front Street on 30 August 1837. Here the \\"Mingo School\\" was built on land purchased for $50 to accommodate the pupils from the eastern part of the borough. The first teacher was hired in 1838. By 1841, three of the six teachers in the ASD were women. In 1858, a larger school was built on Turner Street, just to the west of Eighth Street. Until 1858, primary and secondary education was taught in the same school. That year, Mr. R. W. McAlpine took a group of 14 older students to the Garber-Horne Building, which had been the home of the North American Homeopathic School of Healing Arts at South Penn Street, near the present Allentown School District Administration Building. This was the beginning of Allentown High School. The first class was fourteen pupils, equally divided by boys and girls.1918 Allentown High School Yearbook, History of Allentown High School, pp12-13 In 1859, by a vote of 6 to 2, a separate high school was established, one for boys and one for girls. It was located at the Presbyterian Sunday School. Augustus Armagnac was named teacher for the male students, and Hannah L. Romig for the female students. The first commencement was held in May 1869 in the Presbyterian Church on North Fifth Street. The first graduating class was three students. =Unification= With the division between primary and secondary schools, as the city grew, a primary grammar school was erected in each ward of the borough. Each of these schools was under the supervision of the ward. in January 1866 the various ward district leaders called for a consolidation of the various schools into one school district as a central authority, this led to the formation of the unified Allentown School District. This unification also led eventually to a unified city government, and within a year, legislation was proposed in Harrisburg by Lehigh County State Senator George P. Shall to incorporate Allentown as a city. During the period 1859 to 1894 secondary school classes were held separately for boys and girls. The classes for boys were held in the Leh's store building on Hamilton Street, and the girls' classes were held in the Sunday School rooms of the First Presbyterian Church on North Fifth Street. Classes were transferred to the Fourth Ward Wolf Building from 1880 to 1894. Classes were moved in 1895 to a new building built exclusively as a high school erected at the site of the \\"Old Central School\\", at Lumber and Turner streets. However, it became overcrowded with students and in 1913 five rooms of the Herbst School Building were used for the freshman class of 1918. In 1917 the current main building at 17th and Turner was completed, and Allentown High School was moved and consolidated into its current building. With the opening of school, it housed grades 9-12 until 1928.Allentown School District, History of William Allen High School =20th century= In the 20th century, the city expanded east and west of the Lehigh River, and south into Salisbury Township south of the Little Lehigh. The annexation of Bridgetown in 1911 (now the 14th Ward), and Rittersville in 1920 (now the 15th Ward) expanded the city east to its current boundary with Bethlehem along Club Avenue. In East Allentown, the Moser Elementary School opened in 1917, Ritter Elementary in 1925 and the Midway Manor 1947.East of the Lehigh, A history of the 14th and 15th Ward, 1962, Allentown Bicentennial Commission In 1907, the 12th Ward was established on land south of the Little Lehigh. Jefferson Elementary had begun as a one-room brick schoolhouse built by the Salisbury Township School District in 1858 on the north side of Auburn Street. In 1910 it was replaced by a two-story ten-room brick building and adjacent playground at the intersection of South 8th Street and St. John Street to accommodate the students in South Allentown. The establishment of the 16th Ward along Susquehanna Street in what was called Aineyville in 1920 led to the District taking over Roosevelt Elementary which was built in 1910 by Salisbury. In 1922, the 17th Ward was created and the western boundary of the city was expanded to what is now Cedar Crest Boulevard from 17th Street. At the time there were no houses west of 22d Street and all students went to Jackson Elementary at 15th and Liberty street, built in 1911. A new school Muhlenberg, was built on 21st Street in 1928 to accommodate this western growth. Muhlenberg was supposed to be a junior high school, but the population increased too quickly and it was designated an elementary school.ASD History of Muhlenberg Elementary School A third level of schools, \\"Junior High Schools\\" (today's Middle Schools) were established in 1925 for grades six, seven and eight. The Central School building, which was used as Allentown High School from 1893-1916 was renovated and expanded with two additional buildings and was converted to a Junior High School. Francis D. Raub Elementary School opened in 1923 in the west end of the city. In 1925 it was also converted. In the 1st Ward, the Harrison grammar school for boys and the Morton grammar school for girls was consolidated, and in 1927, Harrison-Morton Junior High School was established. From the 1929-1930 school year, the Junior High Schools began teaching 7th though 9th grade with the adoption of the 6-3-3 plan, and Allentown High School taught 10th though 12th grade. In 1951, the Chew Street wing of Central was torn down and replaced by a playground. Allentown School District, Middle Schools Webpage 1n 1929, Jack Coffield Stadium for interscholastic football was opened directly behind the main building of Allentown High School. Interscholastic football had begun in 1896, the team playing on any open field that was available. Book Focuses on Football under Crum, Allentown Morning Call, November 25, 1996 In 1930 the Annex, the Little Palestra for the basketball team, and the famous \\"tunnel\\" were added to Allentown High School which provided an indoor connection with the main building. Coffield Stadium was replaced by the larger Allentown School District Stadium in 1948. In 1958 the Linden Street Annex was constructed and the vocational students from the Nineteenth Street and Hunsicker Buildings were again brought back to the main campus. In 1940, half- day Kindergarten classes were added to the primary schools. In 1970, these were expanded to full-day classes. After World War II, the expansion of the 12th Ward to include the wartime Convair Field and the wartime housing built for its workers led to the construction of Lehigh Parkway school in 1949. Students had previously attended school in homes. Also the 19th Ward acquisition in 1949 of the land southwest of Lehigh Street and including Mountainville led to the construction of a fourth Junior High School, South Mountain in 1951 and the Hiram Dodd Elementary School in 1956. As the city grew the need for a second high school was inevitable, and in May 1929, the ASD paid $51,000 for a large tract of land at Irving and East Washington Streets in East Allentown. The land was purchased for a new Junior High School to accommodate students east of the Lehigh River. However plans were changed, and 27 years later, on 21 May 1956, ground was broken for the new Louis E. Dieruff High School, named in honor of the educator and administrator who had given 44 years of service to the district. The school was opened in September 1959, and Allentown High School changed its name to William Allen High School in 1960. Allentown School District history of Louis E. Dieruff High School A major realignment of the Junior High School boundaries occurred for the 1967-1968 school year with the closure of Central and the opening of the new Trexler Junior High School. At the same time Central became a citywide \\"Sixth Grade Center\\", with the primary grammar schools being realigned to grades K through 5. All sixth grade students in the ASD were sent to Central. In December 1967, Central suffered a massive fire when the oldest part of the building, built in 1893 as Allentown High School, was completely gutted. It was replaced with a new wing by 1969. 1973 saw the opening of the William Allen High School Physical Education facility, built on the site of the former Coffied Football Field, replacing the Little Plaestra gym and swimming pool. In 1975, a Library-Science Center was built on the site of the Little Palestra. For the 1981-1982 school year, the \\"Middle School\\" concept was adopted by the ASD. Central was realigned to become a K-5 grade elementary school; Harrison-Morton; Raub; South Mountain and Trexler were renamed \\"Middle Schools\\" and taught grades six through eight. William Allen and Dieruff High Schools re-introduced the freshmen (9th grade) class and became 4-year high schools. =21st century= In the early 2000s, the ASD built three new facilities: the Luis A.

In 2012, Allentown City School District's graduation rate was 66%. In 2011, the District's graduation rate was 62.8%. In 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Education issued a new, 4-year cohort graduation rate. Allentown School District's rate was 62.71% for 2010. According to traditional graduation rate calculations: *2010 - 69% *2009 - 67% *2008 - 67% *2007 - 67% =Graduation requirements= The Allentown Area School Board has determined that a student must earn 22.3 credits to graduate, including: English 4 credits, Math 3 credits, Social Studies 3.5 credits, Science 3 credits, Arts and Humanities 2 credits, Physical Education 0.8 credits, Health .5 credits, Computer application .5 credits, and electives 5 credits. For the Graduating Classes of 2012-2014, students must demonstrate PSSA (Pennsylvania System of School Assessment) proficiency in reading, mathematics, and writing. A student who does not attain proficiency on the 11th grade PSSA tests in reading, mathematics, and writing will graduate if he/she successfully completes one of the alternatives: pass the retest of the PSSAs; score at least 900 as a combined total of the verbal and mathematics sections on the SATs; obtain a senior year grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0; or achieve the level of proficiency determined through their IEP process.Allentown School District Course Guide 2011-12, Allentown School Board, 2011 By Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, for the graduating class of 2016, students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, English Composition, and Literature for which the Keystone Exams serve as the final course exams. Students‚Äô Keystone Exam scores shall count for at least one-third of the final course grade. =College remediation= According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 48% of Allentown School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Academic reforms In 2010, the school board hired former Pennsylvania Secretary of Education, Dr. Gerald Zahorchak D.Ed., as Superintendent of Schools. In 2011, he proposed a wide-ranging set of reforms called 2011-2012 Program of Studies and Related Curtailment Plan. After a contentious debate, within the district and with the community, the Allentown Board of School Directors approved the plan in March 2011. As a part of the plan a significant realignment of resources would be undertaken for the 2011-12 school year. This resulted in the reduction of professional staff through furlough, termination or demotion in the following areas: 84 elementary positions, 121 secondary positions and 42 student support positions were eliminated. Some position were not replacing retirements and some were furloughed. The cuts are based on seniority and certification area and amounted to 18% of the district's employees. Under the plan, AP courses are taught, as dual enrollment courses, by local college professors. Some courses at the high schools were cut. In 2017 newly-chosen Superintendent Thomas Parker and the district school board released the Strategic Framework, a new plan for the district. The framework outlines the administration's goals for the district, including an increased focus on college and career readiness for students. The framework also details the district's Theory of Action and affirms its commitment to equity for students and faculty. Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 2,545 pupils or 13.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Allentown School District received a $9,147,139 supplement for special education services in 2010. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 650 or 3.72% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. School safety The Allentown School District administration reported there were 3,047 incidents related to school safety in the district in 2012. This resulted in 96 arrests. There were 4 sexual assaults and 6 indecent exposure events. Bullying was also significant, with 200 instances being reported district wide. The federal No Child Left Behind Act established the Unsafe School Choice Option. Each state that receives federal funds was mandated to establish a statewide policy requiring that a student at a \\"persistently dangerous\\" public school be allowed to transfer/enroll in a safe public school. The policy permitted a student who becomes the victim of a violent criminal offense, while in or on the grounds of any public school that he or she attends, to transfer to a safe public school. Each year since 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Education has released a list of Persistently Dangerous Schools. While the district reports multiple serious crimes on students in several years, Allentown School District schools have not been noted on the Persistently Dangerous Schools lists. The Allentown School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. Pupils are urged to report bullying to the build Principal. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. =Safe School grant= In 2013, Allentown School District was awarded $25,000 in a state Safe Schools Targeted Grant. The maximum of $25,000 grants were awarded through a competitive application process. The funds must be used for research based interventions, like: peer mediation, staff training in managing behavioral issues and creating a positive school climate. =School Resource Officer and Police Officer grant= In 2014, Pennsylvania began a grant program providing funding for programs to address school violence and security. Eligible schools and municipalities could apply for up to $60,000 for a school resource officer and up to $40,000 for a school police officer. Allentown School District did not participate.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-14 School Resource Office/School Police Officer Grant Awardees, 2014 Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE).

Allentown City School District reported a total of $19,694,023 in reserve accounts. The District also reported $ in its unreserved-designated fund in 2010. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2005, the total reserve funds held by Pennsylvania public school districts was $1.9 billion. By 2013, reserves held by Pennsylvania public school districts, as a whole, had increased to over $3.8 billion. Audit In December 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit on the district. Several serious findings were reported to the school board and administration. In September 2013, the District was audited again with serious issues continuing. It found several teachers lacked necessary certification to teach the classes they were providing. It was noted the District had engaged in interest swaps which had caused significant financial costs for the District. Tuition Students who live in the District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2018 tuition rates are Elementary School -$9,263.47, High School - $11,154.73. The Allentown School District is funded by a combination of: a local tax on earned income 0.5%, two per capita taxes totaling $10 a year, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants have provided an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income or losses to the District. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. =State basic education funding= According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, School District receives 52.3% of its annual revenue from the state.

Race to the Top grant Allentown School District officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided several million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. 21st Century Learning grant In July 2012, Allentown School District received a federal grant which is run by the PDE. The grant calls for the establishment and sustainability of community learning centers that provide additional educational services to students in high-poverty and low- performing schools.

The Allentown School District received $350,000. While 101 entities applied for the funding, only 66 were approved including eight charter schools. The funding is for the 2012-13 fiscal year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Education Secretary Announces $19.78 Million Awarded to Enhance Academic Opportunities for At-Risk Students, July 11, 2012 =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2016-17 were set by the school board at 19.7 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2012-13 - 49.3321 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 48.0820 mills. *2010-11 - 45.5920 mills. *2009-10 - 42.9420 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 42.9420 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 42.9420 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 42.9420 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 41.7340 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Lehigh County residents amounts to about 4.39% of their yearly income. Lehigh County ranked 149th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above their annual Act 1 Index unless they either: allow Districts voters to approve the increase through a vote by referendum or they receive an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the school year is published by the PDE in the fall of each year. Each individual school district's Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Originally, Act 1 of 2006 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district's exception for pension payments. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The School District Adjusted Index history for the Allentown School District: *2006-07 - 5.7%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 5.0%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.6%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 6.1%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.4%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 2.1%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.6%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, September 2011 *2013-14 - 2.6%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, September 2012 *2014-15 - 3.2%, Base 2.1% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-2015 School District Adjusted Index, September 2013 For the 2013-14 budget year Allentown School Board applied for three exceptions to exceed their Act 1 Index limit: School Construction Grandfathered Debt, special education costs and rapidly escalating teacher pension costs. For the school budget year 2013-14, 311 Pennsylvania public school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index. Another 171 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 89 school districts received approval to exceed the Index in full while others received a partial approval of their request. For special education costs, 75 districts received approval to exceed their tax limit. For the pension costs exception, 169 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. Eleven Pennsylvania public school districts received an approval for grandfathered construction debts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2013-2014, April 2013 For the 2012-13 budget year, Allentown School Board applied for three exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: School Construction Grandfathered Debt, special education costs and escalating teacher pension costs. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, the Allentown School Board applied for three exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: School Construction Grandfathered Debt, special education costs and escalating teacher pension costs. Each year, the Allentown School Board has the option of adopting either: 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. For the budget in 2010-11, the Allentown School Board applied for two exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index: special education costs and escalating teacher pension costs. For the 2009-10 school budget, the Allentown School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2012, in the Allentown School District, 18,246 approved homestead properties received $528. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The amount of property tax relief each Pennsylvania public school district receives is announced by the PDE in May of each year. The amount of tax relief is dependent on the total tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. Thirty five percent of the slots tax revenues are used for property tax relief. In Lehigh County, the highest tax relief went to Allentown School District.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2009. The highest property tax relief provided, among Pennsylvania school districts, goes to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District in Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009 The tax relief was started by Governor Rendell with passage of the gaming law legalizing table games in casinos. Rendell promised taxpayers substantial property tax relief from legalized gambling. In Lehigh County, 76.15% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. This was a midrange participation rate among Pennsylvania counties.Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, February 23, 2010 In Pennsylvania, the homestead exclusion reduces the assessed values of homestead properties, reducing the property tax on these homes. The homestead exclusion allows homeowners real property tax relief of up to one half of the median assessed value of homesteads in the taxing jurisdiction (county, school district, city, borough, or township). Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. In 2012, the Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million.Elias, Joe., Pennsylvania Treasury Department to issue $238 million in property tax rebates, The Harrisburg Patriot-News, June 30, 2012 The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Wellness policy Allentown School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006.Allentown School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, June 2007 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Allentown School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. Allentown School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2011, the City of Allentown's Health Bureau awarded $50,000 under a national grant called ACHIEVE, \\"Action Communities for Health, Innovation and Environmental Change\\" to increase \\"active\\" time within the District's physical education classes. In 2013, Allentown School District is participating in a regional Health Information Exchange which will make the students private medical information broadly available in the region. In the Lehigh Valley, the Children's Care Alliance is leading the initiative. Parents will ba asked for consent to place their child's information in the exchange. =Highmark Healthy High 5 grant= In 2011, the Allentown School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. Twenty two of the district's schools received grant of $6,900 or less which was used to fund the SPARK program (Sports Play and Active Recreation for Kids). SPARK requires that Physical Education must devote at least 50% of class time to moderate to vigorous activity.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. The Highmark Foundation awarded a $105,000 grant to Sacred Heart Hospital to sustain operations of school-based health centers (SBHCs) in five Allentown School District elementary schools. These SBHCs provide primary care services and a medical home for predominantly uninsured students and their families. The grant partially funded salaries for two certified nurse practitioners, two medical assistants and an administrative/business liaison for two years. The family health centers are located in: Jefferson Elementary School, Roosevelt Elementary School, Sheridan Elementary School, Mosser Elementary School and Dodd Elementary School.

Kemper would make the biggest portion of his fortune by selling these assets to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and converting his shares into Santa Fe stock.Garwood, Darrell (1948). Crossroads of America: The Story of Kansas City. W W Norton & Co. p.142, 144-145. =Association with Harry Truman= Kemper's history was intertwined with that of Harry S. Truman. Truman's father, John Anderson Truman, traded grain commodities futures alongside Kemper until John Truman lost his fortune. John took Harry, then a teenager, to the local Democratic functions in Kansas City where Kemper was also in attendance. Kemper arranged for Truman to be a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention in Kansas City. As a young man Harry would go to work in the National Bank of Commerce, 1903‚Äì1905, where Kemper was a director. In 1934 during Truman's first run for the United States Senate, Kemper bought the assets of the failed Continental National Bank which included the mortgage on Truman's failed haberdashery and in turn allowed Truman to retire it for $1,000 (while at the same time also contributing $1,000 to Truman's campaign).Ferrell, Robert Hugh (1996).

Chester was born in Flatbush in Brooklyn, New York. X-rays used to treat childhood illness left him bald, and he wore a wig, which though noticeable was not something that people felt comfortable mentioning. He was educated at Orthodox Jewish yeshiva. He attended New York University where he met fellow writers Cynthia Ozick (who later wrote about him in her book Fame & Folly), Sol Yurick and Edward Field (who wrote \\"The Man Who Would Marry Susan Sontag\\" which has many chapters dedicated to the biography and literary career of Alfred Chester). He attended graduate school at Columbia University but dropped out. He lived in France for most of the 1950s as an openly gay man. In 1952 his essay \\"Silence in Heaven\\" was published in Marguerite Caetani's literary review Botteghe oscure. (Caetani was the U.S.-born wife of an Italian nobleman.) Chester wrote a pornographic novel, Chariot of Flesh, for Olympia Press, using the pseudonym Malcolm Nesbit. His first collection of short stories, Here Be Dragons, was published in 1955. His novel Jamie Is My Heart's Desire was initially published in a French translation, then in an English edition by the British publisher Andr√© Deutsch, and only later appeared in the United States. With Caetani's support, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1957.John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation 1957 Fellows Page His short story \\"As I Was Going Up the Stair\\" was included in Best American Short Stories.Biographical sketch, Alfred Chester Papers, Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin Starting in 1959, his short fiction was published in magazines such as The New Yorker, Esquire, and Transatlantic Review. His literary criticism appeared in the New York Review of Books, Partisan Review, and Commentary. He returned to the United States and met Susan Sontag through Harriet Sohmers and Mar√≠a Irene Forn√©s. Chester moved to Morocco in 1963. His short story collection Behold Goliath was published in 1964, and his novel The Exquisite Corpse was published in 1967. He associated with Paul Bowles and Jane Bowles while in Morocco, but eventually fell out with both of them. Increasingly, his behavior was made erratic by a combination of mental illness and drug use. It is uncertain if he was ever formally diagnosed, but based on his symptoms, he must have suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, which he developed in 1958 at age 30 at the MacDowell Artists Colony in New Hampshire, a typical age of onset. He died in Israel in 1971.Biographical Note, Alfred Chester Letters to Curtis Harnack, University of Delaware His later writing was published posthumously in collections such as Looking for Genet.

A 6'2\\" guard, Duerod played college basketball under Dick Vitale at the University of Detroit. In four seasons at Detroit, Duerod scored 1,690 points, averaging 23.3 points per game during his senior season. When Vitale accepted a coaching job with the NBA's Detroit Pistons in 1979, the Pistons selected Duerod in the third round of the 1979 NBA draft. Duerod averaged 9.3 points per game during his rookie season in the NBA, shooting 47 percent from the field. After the Pistons replaced Vitale with Richie Adubato, however, Duerod was left unprotected in the 1980 NBA Expansion Draft, where he was selected by the Dallas Mavericks. Duerod only played eighteen games for Dallas before being waived. He was then signed by the Boston Celtics, with whom he would become a fan favorite as the team's twelfth man. Celtics fans often chanted \\"Doooo!\\" whenever Duerod entered games, and he became a frequent subject of discussion among the Celtics' television and radio announcers. Duerod earned a championship ring when the Celtics won the 1981 NBA Finals over the Houston Rockets. Duerod played one more season with the Celtics, then played five games for the Golden State Warriors during the 1982‚Äì83 season. In his NBA career, he averaged 6.7 points per game. He was inducted into the University of Detroit's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993. Duerod served as a Detroit firefighter for 27 years, mostly driving fire trucks. Duerod also played on the fire department's basketball team. He retired because of the department's mandatory retirement policy.

Potable water diving is diving in a tank for potable water. This is usually done for inspection and cleaning tasks. A person who is trained to do this work may be described as a potable water diver. The risks to the diver associated with potable water diving are related to the access, confined spaces and outlets for the water. The risk of contamination of the water is managed by isolating the diver in a clean dry- suit and helmet or full-face mask which are decontaminated before the dive. Scope Divers can inspect water storage tanks, towers and clearwells without draining them or taking them out of service. The work is classified as commercial diving and diver qualifications, equipment and dive team composition will generally be regulated.Ron Perrin, Inspecting & Cleaning Potable Water Storage Xlibris Corporation, , page 112 The American Water Works Association (AWWA) publishes a technical standard, C652, that outlines recommendations for divers in potable water facilities.American Water Works Association, Disinfection of Water-Storage Facilities, ANSI/AWWA C652-11, section 4.4.5 The diver is totally encapsulated (no part of the diver's body touches the water) in a drysuit and helmet, and then washed down with a 200 ppm chlorine solution prior to entry into the tank. All diving dress is to be used exclusively in drinking water. This meets AWWA standards for entering a public water system. The diver is able to move about the tank to perform inspections or clean the tank. AWWA recommends removing sediment accumulations over deep from the floor of a drinking water tank because it can harbor bacteria or other contaminants which could adversely affect water quality. Using a specially equipped pump or airlift system the diver can remove loose sediment without damaging painted surfaces. This allows the chlorine in the system to function more effectively. Divers are an effective means to clean and inspect potable water storage tanks because all of the maintenance can be done while the tank remains in-service and full of water, though it may be necessary to close all inlet and outlet valves during the operation as they may present an unacceptable pressure difference hazard, and most of the interior surfaces of the tank can be easily accessed. Hazards Diving in a confined space presents specific hazards related to the possibility of an unbreathable atmosphere above the water surface, and tight access openings. Large tanks and water towers present hazards of access by ladder and working at height. The recovery of an unconscious diver can be complicated by inaccessibility and special extrication equipment will be needed on site to deal with this possibility. Diving teams may require confined space training and working at heights certification and must follow the appropriate standards or code of practice for this work. The diver should wear a diving harness, connected to a safety rope, so that in case of an emergency the dive tender can pull the diver up. Diving contractors always need to check the safety legislation appropriate to their local jurisdiction,Australian Tank Maintenance, Field Technician and perform a job safety analysis for the specific site. Differential pressure hazards are also usually present in operational storage tanks, and a lockout-tagout procedure for outlets is normally required to minimise the risk. Equipment Diving in potable water uses the same type of equipment that would be used for diving in contaminated water, and for a similar reason. It is necessary to prevent contamination, but in this case it is the diving medium which must not be contaminated, as decontamination takes place before the diver enters the water. The equipment used should be dedicated to this application to minimise the contamination risk. On the other hand, a leak into the suit is of little consequence. Wireless communications do not work well in metal and concrete structures, so hard-wired diver telephone systems are the standard. Umbilicals should have as little place to trap contaminants as reasonably practicable - umbilicals held together by twisting the components like laid rope are preferred to umbilicals held together by tape or a casing. Gas supply and the control point for communications and gas control may have to be at some distance from the access opening, so communications between team members is important. A hoist system is often necessary as a means for recovering an unconscious diver from the enclosed space of the tank. Simple tripod frames are commonly used to support the hoist system over the access opening. Other hoisting systems may be used, providing that they do not unduly risk contaminating the water. The diver's harness must be suitable for lifting the diver out of the water without further injury, in a posture that allows the diver to be hoisted out through the access opening. Regional requirements In the USA commercial diving operations require at least one trained tender, a diver, and a supervisor. In some other countries a standby diver is required at all professional diving operations. Surface-supplied air with two-way voice communications with the diver and a safety rope are preferred and in some jurisdictions may be obligatory. In the US the Occupational Safety & Health Administration regulation 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart T allows scuba with a rope for basic communications.

Built in 1840, it is a stylistically rare example of Greek Revival architecture in Alabama, with elements from the late Federal period. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973 for its architecture. Description and history Barton Hall is located in a rural setting about west of the town of Cherokee and south of United States Route 72. It is set on of land, accessed via an elliptical drive from Cedar Lane. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a clapboarded exterior, and a truncated hip roof topped by a belvedere. Single-story gable-roofed wings extend to the rear. The main facade is five bays wide, with a symmetrical arrangement of windows around the central entrance. The central bay is set off from the others by fluted pilasters, which also appear at the building corners. The entrance is sheltered by a deep porch supported by fluted Doric columns, and featuring Doric triglyphs in its cornice. The porch is topped by a balcony accessed via a second-story entrance stylistically similar to the main entrance below. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a transom window and eared architrave. Period interior features include a unique stairway which ascends in a series of double flights and bridge-like landings to an observatory on the rooftop that offered views of the plantation. and In 1840, Armstead Barton, a native of Tennessee, moved to the area and purchased , on which he began construction of this house. The house remained unfinished at the time of his death in 1847 and was completed two years later under his widow's supervision. The property was sold out of the Barton family in 1908. In 1967, a Barton descendant repurchased the house. In November 2008, the noted photographer Charles Moore took his final documented images on this property.

Lyrics and music Music critic Chris Charlesworth describes \\"Drowned\\" as a \\"tough blues-based rocker.\\" He states that the band loved to play it live since it was less complex than other songs from Quadrophenia. Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh describes the song as among the most interesting on the album. Who biographer John Atkins views the song as having \\"such purity of essence\\" that it may be the \\"quintessential Quadrophenia performance.\\" He describes it as being \\"simple and direct\\" without needed \\"cleverness,\\" dramatic musical effects or complex arrangements.\\" The oldest song featuring on Quadrophenia (\\"Joker James\\", though hailing from the Tommy era, did not feature on the album), \\"Drowned\\" was initially written as an ode to Meher Baba in early 1970. Townshend sang it facing the tomb of Meher Baba on his first visit to India in January 1972. In Quadrophenia, \\"Drowned\\" tells of how Jimmy contemplates drowning himself in the water, in the midst of his disappointment at not being able to see his hero, the Ace Face. At the end, seagulls, crowd noises and waves can be heard, along with Pete Townshend walking along singing the sixth verse of \\"Sea and Sand\\". Mike Segretto interprets the water in the song as a metaphor for God and the song itself as a metaphor for the search for spirituality, or the \\"quest for a tributary leading to God.\\" Steve Grantley and Alan G. Parker interpret the song similarly. According to them, in the song Jimmy sees the ocean \\"as a symbol of cleansing redemption.\\" Atkins interprets the song as representing the \\"freedom of release,\\" both in the lyrics and in the music. Atkins also notes that in the song Jimmy adopts a \\"wider philosophy than mod conformism,\\" which is his objective through much of the album. The piano part was borrowed from the song \\"Hitchcock Railway\\" by Joe Cocker.

Overview  The academy hosts an annual eight-week summer music festival, highlighted by concerts and workshops directed by famous composers, conductors, and artists. The festival hosts 140 pre- professional musicians who receive merit-based full scholarships. Programs of study are vocal piano, voice, collaborative piano, solo piano, and instrumental. The academy is partnering with the UC Santa Barbara to preserve historic audio and video recordings of concerts, masterclasses and recitals held at Music Academy of the West. In 2017, 400 early recordings have been digitized, among them recordings of Lotte Lehmann, Marilyn Horne, and Jerome Lowenthal.  History  The first impulse to establish a summer music festival in Santa Barbara came from soprano Lotte Lehmann in 1940. In 1947 the Music Academy of the West was founded by Southern California arts patrons, musicians, conductors and composers. In addition to Lotte Lehmann, founders of the academy where conductor Otto Klemperer, violinist Roman Totenberg, harpsichordist Rosalyn Tureck, baritone John Charles Thomas and composers Ernest Bloch, Darius Milhaud, Roy Harris and Arnold Schoenberg, who served as the academy's first composer in residence. Among the first scholarschip funders where singer-actors Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, violinist Jascha Heifetz and movie producer Daryl F. Zanuck. From 1954 to 1980 the academy's music director was Maurice Abravanel. Martial Singher was head of the Voice Department from 1962 till 1981. In 1997 Marilyn Horne was named director of the voice program and remained in this position till 2018. In 2018, Horne became the honorary voice program director. Since 2010, the academy has held the annual Marilyn Horne Song Competition, formerly known as the Marilyn Horne Foundation Vocal Competition. In the same year, Scott Reed became the academy's president and chief executive officer. Past presidents have included David Kuehn and NancyBell Coe. In 2014, the Music Academy of the West began an educational partnership with the New York Philharmonic. Under the collaboration, music director Alan Gilbert and orchestra members maintained residencies in Santa Barbara during parts of the festival, and selected Music Academy fellows trained with orchestra members in Santa Barbara and New York City. In 2018, the academy launched a four-year partnership with the London Symphony Orchestra with music director Simon Rattle, and a free after school choral program called Sing! for children ages 7‚Äì11 taking place in elementary schools in Santa Barbara County. Participants perform at the Music Academy of the West and collaborate with the London Symphony Orchestra.  Alumni  Alumni of the Music Academy of the West are former attendants of the conservatory programs. Many of them fill important professional music positions around the world, performing in top-tier orchestras, opera houses, and teaching on music school faculties.

Talmudist Daniel Boyarin has recently defined ◊û◊©◊ú as a process of \\"exemplification,\\" seeing it as the sine qua non of Talmudic hermeneutics (Boyarin 2003: 93). He quotes Song of Songs Rabba: \\"until Solomon invented the ◊û◊©◊ú, no one could understand Torah at all.\\" The phenomenon has been compared to the more recent phenomenon of sampling in modern popular music, especially hip-hop (Levy 2010). Biblical parables The Tanakh contains many parables (and also a few symbolic stories, such as Ezekiel 3:24-26, 4:1-4, and 14:3-5). Some of these parables are: *Of the trees who wished to crown themselves a king, the fruitful trees not wishing to abandon their functions except for the bramble (Judges 9:7-20); intended to illustrate the futility of crowning kings. *Of the poor man who had raised a single lamb which a wealthy neighbor took to set before a guest (2 Samuel 12:1-4); intended to illustrate the sin which David had committed with Bathsheba, Uriah's wife. *Of the wise woman of Tekoah, who induced David to make peace with his son Absalom (2 Samuel 14:6-8). *Of the prophet's disciple, showing Ahab the wrong course which he had adopted toward Ben-hadad (1 Kings 20:39-40). *Of the vineyard which does not thrive despite the care bestowed upon it (Isaiah 5:1-6), illustrating Israel's degeneracy. *Of the farmer who does not plough continually, but prepares the field and sows his seed, arranging all his work in due order (Isaiah 28:24-28); intended to show the methodical activity of God. All these parables were based on conditions familiar at the time; and even the event described in 2 Samuel 14:6-8 was probably no rare occurrence, in view of the custom which then prevailed of avenging bloodshed. In the Talmud A large number of parables are found in post-Biblical literature, in Talmud and Midrash. The Talmudic writers believed in the pedagogic importance of the parable, and regarded it as a valuable means of determining the true sense of the Law and of attaining a correct understanding thereof (Cant. R. i. 8). Johanan b. Zakkai is said to have studied parables and fables side by side with the Mi·∏≥ra, Mishnah, Halakah, Haggadah, etc. (B. B. 134a; Suk. 28a), and R. Me√Ør used to divide his public discourses into halakah, haggadah, and parables (Sanh. 38b). In the Talmud and Midrash almost every religious idea, moral maxim, or ethical requirement is accompanied by a parable which illustrates it. Among the religious and moral tenets which are thus explained may be mentioned the following: the existence of God (Gen. R. xxxiv. 1); His manner of retribution, and of punishing sins both in this world and in the next ('Ab. Zarah 4a; Yalk., Lev. 464; Shab. 152a); His faithful governance ('Ab. Zarah 55a; Sanh. 108a); His impatience of injustice (Suk. 30a); His paternal leniency (Ex. R. xlvi. 6), and His relation to Israel (ib. xlvi. 4; Ber. 32a); Israel's sufferings (Ber. 13a); the folly of idolatry ('Ab. Zarah 54b-55a); the Law as the guardian and faithful protector in life (Sotah 21a); the sin of murder (Mek., Yitro, 8 [ed. Weiss, p. 78a]); the resurrection (Sanh. 91a); the value of benevolence (B. B. 10a); the worth of a just man for his contemporaries (Meg. 15a); the failure of popularity as a proof of intrinsic value (Sotah 40a); the evil tendency of freedom from anxiety (Ber. 32a); the limitations of human knowledge and understanding (Sanh. 39a); the advantage frequently resulting from what appears to be evil (Niddah 31a); conversion (Shab. 153a); purity of soul and its reward (ib. 152b). Although the haggadists took the material for their parables from conditions of life with which their hearers were familiar, yet they selected details to which Biblical allusions were found to apply; since in certain cases the idea underlying the parable was already well known to their auditors. Thus parables dealing with kings were frequently chosen to illustrate God's relation to the world in general and to Israel in particular, as in Num. R. ii. 24, since the idea of the God-king had been made familiar to the people by the Bible (Ps. x. 16; Zeph. iii. 16; Zech. xiv. 16-17; Mal. i. 14). Israel is the first-born of the Lord (Ex. iv. 22; Deut. xiv. 1); there are accordingly many parables of a king who had a son who was very dear to him (Ber. 13a; Deut. R. iii. 12; Ex. R. xix. 8), which illustrate God's relation to Israel. This relation is also frequently illustrated by the parable of a king who had a beloved or a wife (e.g., Num. R. ii. 14-15; Deut. R. iii. 9, 11, 16), since, according to Isa. liv. 5, Jer. ii. 2, and Hosea ii. 18, 21-22, Israel is the bride of God, His wife, whom He loves, and whom He always takes back, although He may at times disown her and cast her off. The attitude of God toward Israel is illustrated with especial frequency by the parable of a king who had a vineyard in which he planted fine vines (e.g., Num. R. xv. 18, and in Tan·∏•uma in most of the weekly sections), on account of the comparison of Israel to the vineyard of God (Isa. v. 1-7), and to the noble vine which He planted (Jer. ii. 21). Similarly the flight of the prophet Jonah from God is illustrated by the parable of the servant who runs away from his master (Mek., Bo, i. [ed. Weiss, 1b]), since the idea that a prophet is a servant of God was familiar to the people from Isa. xx. 3, 1. 10. The following Talmudic parables may be quoted to show the manner in which the writers employed this form of argument: Examples A pagan philosopher once asked R. Gamaliel why God is angry with idolaters and not with idols, whereupon R. Gamaliel answered him with the following parable: \\"A king had a son who raised a dog which he named after his royal father; and whenever he was about to swear he said, 'By the life of the dog, the father.' When the king heard of this, against whom did his anger turn, against the dog or against the son? Surely only against the son\\" ('Ab. Zarah 54b). Once Akiba was asked to explain why persons afflicted with disease sometimes returned cured from a pilgrimage to the shrine of an idol, though it was surely powerless. His answer was the following parable: \\"There was a man in a certain city who enjoyed the confidence of all his fellow citizens to such a degree that without witnesses they entrusted deposits to him, with the exception of one man in the city who always made his deposits before a witness. One day, however, this distrustful man forgot his caution, and gave the other a deposit without a witness. The wife of the trustworthy man attempted to induce him to deny having received a deposit from the distrustful man, as a punishment for his suspicion; but the husband said: 'Shall I deny my rectitude because this fool acts in an unseemly fashion?' Thus it is with the sufferings inflicted by Heaven upon man, which have a day and an hour appointed for their end. If it happens that a man goes on that day to the idol's shrine, the sufferings are tempted not to leave him, but they say, 'Shall we not fulfil our obligation to leave this fool, although he has behaved with folly?'\\" (ib. 55a).Emperor Antoninus asked Rabbi how there could be punishment in the life beyond, for, since body and soul after their separation could not have committed sin, they could blame each other for the sins committed upon earth, and Rabbi answered him by the following parable: \\"A certain king had a beautiful garden in which was excellent fruit; and over it he appointed two watchmen, one blind and the other lame. The lame man said to the blind one, 'I see exquisite fruit in the garden. Carry me thither that I may get it; and we will eat it together.' The blind man consented and both ate of the fruit. After some days the lord of the garden came and asked the watchmen concerning the fruit. Then the lame man said, 'As I have no legs I could not go to take it'; and the blind man said, 'I could not even see it.' What did the lord of the garden do? He made the blind man carry the lame, and thus passed judgment on them both. So God will replace the souls in their bodies, and will punish both together for their sins\\" (Sanh. 91a, b). La Fontaine, in his \\"Fables,\\" ascribes this parable to Confucius. The Parable of the Banquet Johanan b. Zakkai illustrates the necessity of daily conversion and of constant readiness to appear before God in heaven by the following parable: \\"A king invited his servants to a banquet without stating the exact time at which it would be given. Those who were wise remembered that all things are ever ready in the palace of a king, and they arrayed themselves and sat by the palace gate awaiting the call to enter, while those who were foolish continued their customary occupations, saying, 'A banquet requires great preparation.' When the king suddenly called his servants to the banquet, those who were wise appeared in clean raiment and well adorned, while those who were foolish came in soiled and ordinary garments. The king took pleasure in seeing those who were wise, but was full of anger at those who were foolish, saying that those who had come prepared for the banquet should sit down and eat and drink, but that those who had not properly arrayed themselves should stand and look on\\" (Shab. 153a). Similar parables expressing the same thought are found in the New Testament (Matt. xxii. 10-12, xxv. 1-12; Luke xii. 36). Another parable may be cited from the Palestinian Talmud, which is found in the New Testament also. When R. ·∏§iyya's son, R. Abin, died at the early age of twenty-eight, R. Zera delivered the funeral oration, which he couched in the form of the following parable: \\"A king had a vineyard for which he engaged many laborers, one of whom was especially apt and skilful. What did the king do? He took this laborer from his work, and walked through the garden conversing with him. When the laborers came for their hire in the evening, the skilful laborer also appeared among them and received a full day's wages from the king. The other laborers were angry at this and said, 'We have toiled the whole day, while this man has worked but two hours; why does the king give him the full hire, even as to us?' The king said to them: 'Why are you angry? Through his skill he has done more in the two hours than you have done all day.' So is it with R. Abin b. ·∏§iyya. In the twenty-eight years of his life he has learned more than others learn in 100 years. Hence he has fulfilled his life-work and is entitled to be called to paradise earlier than others from his work on earth; nor will he miss aught of his reward\\" (Yer. Ber. ii. 5c). In Matt. xx. 1-16 this parable is intended to illustrate the doctrine that the heathen who have accepted Christianity have equal rights with the Jews in the kingdom of heaven. Other interesting parables of the Talmud are found in ·∏≤id. 2b; Niddah 31b; B. ·∏≤. 60b; B. B. 16a; Ber. 7b, 9b; Yoma 38b-39a; Suk. 29a; Meg. 14a; M. ·∏≤. 21b; ·∏§ag. 12b; Ta'an. 5b-6a; Sanh. 96a. In the Midrash Parables occur with even greater frequency in the Midrash than in the Talmud, one or more parables being found in nearly every section in Midrash Rabbah as well as in Tan·∏•uma. It is not necessary to quote any of these, since they are used in the same way as in the Talmud, and the examples cited from the Talmud may serve also as specimens of midrashic parables, especially as nearly all of those quoted are found in the Midrash as well. The parables of both the Talmud and the Midrash, reflecting the characteristics of the life of their time, are a valuable aid in studying the cultural history of that period; Ziegler has shown, e.g., that the parables dealing with kings reflect the conditions of the Roman empire. The same statement holds true in the case of the other parables of the Talmud and Midrash, which likewise mirror their time; for it may be assumed that the haggadists who made use of the form of the parable were intimately acquainted with the conditions upon which they drew for illustration, although they may have colored those conditions to suit their purposes. The teachers, philosophers of religion, and preachers of the post- Talmudic period also had recourse to the parable to illustrate their meaning, such as Bachya ibn Pakuda in his \\"Chovot ha-Levavot\\" (ii. 6, iii. 9), Judah ha-Levi in his \\"Kuzari\\" (i. 109), and Leon of Modena (comp. Azulai, \\"Shem ha- Gedolim,\\" s.v.). In the eighteenth century Jacob Kranz of Dubno (Dubner Maggid) was especially noted as a composer of parables, introducing them frequently into his sermons. His homiletic commentaries on the Pentateuch and on certain other books of the Old Testament contain many parables taken from life and which serve to illustrate the condition of the Jews of his time.

Lemon People was the longest-running lolita manga magazine in Japan. The magazine genre including science fiction, cyberpunk, space opera, fantasy, and horror that was common worldwide, While the stories were serious, they often were described as humor and parody. Lemon People received competition from other magazines such as Manga Burikko, Manga Hot Milk, Melon Comic, and Monthly Halflita, though none of them achieved the same success. Before Lemon People, adult comics tended to be more dramatic and serious. Lemon People changed the genre by introducing a more cute style of manga, often with less realistic storylines. Lemon People was considered the beginning of the \\"new wave\\" of lolicon manga. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, there was a growing movement in Japan to censor magazines such as Lemon People because some viewed them as harmful to young people. By the mid-1990s, the sales of Lemon People began to drop, and the magazine changed its format to the B5 paper size and reduced its cover price. However this strategy was not effective, and the November 1998 issue was the last one, ending a run of sixteen years and nine months.

California, 551 U.S. 249 (2007), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that all occupants of a car are \\"seized\\" for purposes of the Fourth Amendment during a traffic stop, not just the driver. Facts In the early morning hours of November 27, 2001, a Sutter County deputy sheriff and his partner, who was a cadet at the time, stopped a car in which Bruce Brendlin was riding. The car's registration had expired, but the owner had applied for a renewal, and a valid temporary registration permit was properly affixed to the car. Nevertheless, the deputy decided to investigate further. He asked the driver of the car, Karen Simeroth, for her license, and noticed that Bruce Brendlin, \\"one of the Brendlin brothers,\\" was sitting in the passenger seat. The deputy determined that there was a warrant out for Brendlin's arrest, and so he called for backup. Once backup arrived, Brendlin and Simeroth were arrested. The police found an orange syringe cap on Brendlin's person while on Simeroth's person and vehicle, they found methamphetamine, marijuana, and various drug paraphernalia along with equipment used to manufacture methamphetamine in the car. Brendlin was charged with possession and manufacture of methamphetamine. Before trial, he moved to suppress the evidence found on his person and in the car as fruits of an unlawful seizure--unlawful because, he argued, the police had acted in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and had neither probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or any warrant to make the traffic stop or seize Brendlin or any of his possessions and use it against him in court. The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that Brendlin was first \\"seized\\" at the point he was removed from the car and arrested. Brendlin pleaded guilty but reserved the right to appeal the suppression issue, and was sentenced to four years in prison. The California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress. However, the California Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal, reinstating the trial court's decision. Although the State conceded that the police had no lawful basis to effect the traffic stop, the California Supreme Court still held that the trial court was correct in denying the motion to suppress because, it reasoned, \\"a passenger is not seized as a constitutional matter in the absence of additional circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable person that he or she was the subject of the peace officer's investigation or show of authority.\\" Simeroth was the exclusive target of the traffic stop, and so Brendlin was not seized until the police did something else to cast their eyes upon him. The decision was at odds with several federal circuit courts of appeal.http://www.volokh.com/2007/01/19/supreme-court-grants-cert-in-brendlin- v-california/ The issue before the Court was whether a passenger in a vehicle subject to a traffic stop is thereby \\"detained\\" for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, thus allowing the passenger to contest the legality of the traffic stop. Opinion of the Court A person is \\"seized\\" for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when physical force or a show of authority terminates or restrains his freedom of movement. If the police's intent to restrain an individual is unclear, or if an individual's submission to a show of authority takes the form of passive acquiescence, a seizure does not occur unless a reasonable person would not feel free to leave in light of all the circumstances. If, however, the person has no desire to leave for reasons unrelated to the traffic stop, there is no seizure. Before the Court's decision in this case, the law was clear that a traffic stop seized the driver of the car. The Court had also repeatedly suggested--but never formally held--that a traffic stop in fact seizes everyone in the vehicle. With its decision in this case, the Court expressly so held. \\"We think that in these circumstances any reasonable passenger would have understood the police officers to be exercising control to the point that no one in the car was free to depart without police permission.\\" A traffic stop necessarily curtails the freedom of movement of all within the vehicle, and a reasonable person riding in a stopped vehicle would know that some wrongdoing led the police to stop the vehicle. At the same time, any occupant of the vehicle cannot be sure of the reason for the stop. \\"If the likely wrongdoing is not the driving, the passenger will reasonably feel subject to suspicion owing to close association; but even when the wrongdoing is only bad driving, the passenger will expect to be subject to some scrutiny, and his attempt to leave the scene would be so obviously likely to prompt an objection from the officer that no reasonable passenger would feel free to leave in the first place.\\" Moreover, no passenger could expect an officer to allow him to move around in ways that might jeopardize the officer's safety. The California Supreme Court went astray by making three assumptions with which the Court disagreed. First, it reasoned that Brendlin was not the initial focus of the police's investigation, being concerned as they were with verifying the registration of the car, which Brendlin did not own. But the Court pointed out that this reasoning ignores the focus of the Fourth Amendment on what a reasonable person would believe, not the subjective intentions of the officers. Second, the California court reasoned that Brendlin was not in a position to submit to the officers' show of authority because only the driver of the car could do so. But the acts that constitute submission to a show of authority depend on what the person was doing beforehand. As a passenger in a vehicle, Brendlin could not affirmatively submit until the vehicle was stopped on the side of the road. Third, the California Supreme Court resisted the conclusion the Court drew because it feared that occupants of cars merely stuck in traffic would also be \\"seized\\" under a contrary holding.

Hamas was established in 1987, and has its origins in Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood movement, which had been active in the Gaza Strip since the 1950s and gained influence through a network of mosques and various charitable and social organizations. In the 1980s the Brotherhood emerged as a powerful political factor, challenging the influence of the PLO, and in 1987 adopted a more nationalist and activist line under the name of Hamas. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the organization conducted numerous suicide bombings and other attacks against Israel. In the Palestinian legislative election of January 2006, Hamas gained a large majority of seats in the Palestinian Parliament, defeating the ruling Fatah party. After the elections, conflicts arose between Hamas and Fatah, which they were unable to resolve.\\"The Gangs of Gaza\\" , Newsweek, June 26, 2006.al-Mughrabi, Nidal and Assadi, Mohammed.

In June 2007, Hamas defeated Fatah in a series of violent clashes, and since that time Hamas has governed the Gaza portion of the Palestinian Territories, while at the same time they were ousted from government positions in the West Bank.Exposing the bitter truth of Gaza carnage The Age, June 23, 2007 Israel and Egypt then imposed an economic blockade on Gaza and largely sealed their borders with the territory.\\"Gaza faces economic disaster if blockade continues, U.N. official warns\\" International Herald TribuneDion Nissenbaum. \\"Olmert aide supports free Gaza\\" .

After acquiring control of Gaza, Hamas-affiliated and other militias launched rocket attacks upon Israel, which Hamas ceased in June 2008 following an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire. The ceasefire broke down late in 2008, with each side accusing the other of responsibility.Qassam lands in western Negev, no injuries Ynet News November 20, 2008 In late December 2008, Israel attacked Gaza, withdrawing its forces in mid-January 2009.\\"Israel withdraws its troops from Gaza\\" Times Online  Early Islamic activism in Gaza  With its takeover of Gaza after the 1967 war with Egypt, Israel hunted down secular Palestinian Liberation Organization factions, but dropped the previous Egyptian rulers' harsh restrictions against Islamic activists. In fact, Israel for many years tolerated and at times encouraged Islamic activists and groups as a counterweight to the secular nationalists of the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah.Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad Matthew Levitt & Dennis Ross, Yale University Press, 2007, p. 24. \\"Scholars and historians on both sides ... agree that from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s the [Muslim] Brotherhood benefited from the Israeli government's support of non-violent Islamist Palestinian factions, believing these groups would function as a useful counterweight to the secular nationalist Palestinian groups\\". Among the activists benefited was Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza, who had also formed the Islamist group Mujama al- Islamiya, a charity recognized by Israel in 1979. Israel allowed the organization to build mosques, clubs, schools, and a library in Gaza. Yitzhak Segev, the acting governor of Gaza in 1979, said he had no illusions about Yassin's intentions, having watched an Islamist movement topple the Shah as Israel's military attache in Iran. However, according to Segev, Yassin and his charity were \\"100% peaceful\\" towards Israel during this time, and Segev and other Israeli officials feared being viewed as an enemy of Islam. Segev maintained regular contact with Yassin, met with him around a dozen times, and arranged for Yassin to be taken to Israel for hospital treatment. Also, Segev said, Fatah was \\"our main enemy.\\" Islamists frequently attacked secular and leftist Palestinian movements, including Fatah, but the Israeli military avoided getting involved in those quarrels. It stood aside, for example, when Mujama al-Islamiya activists stormed the Red Crescent charity's headquarters in Gaza, but Segev did send soldiers to prevent the burning down of the home of the head of the organization. In 1984 the Israeli army received intelligence that Yassin's followers were collecting arms in Gaza. Israeli troops raided mosques and found a cache of weapons. Yassin was arrested, but told his interrogators the weapons were meant to be used against secular Palestinians, not Israel. The cleric was released a year later and allowed to continue to develop his movement in Gaza. Around the time of Yassin's arrest, Avner Cohen, an Israeli religious affairs official, sent a report to senior military officers and civilian leadership in Gaza advising them of the dangers of the Islamic movement, but this report and similar ones were ignored. Former military intelligence officer Shalom Harari said the warnings were ignored out of neglect, not a desire to fortify the Islamists: \\"Israel never financed Hamas. Israel never armed Hamas.\\"  1987 ‚Äì The founding of Hamas  In 1987, several Palestinians were killed in a traffic accident involving an Israeli driver, and the events that followed‚Äìa Palestinian uprising against Israel's West Bank and Gaza occupation‚Äìled Yassin and six other Palestinians to found Hamas as an offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. The new group was supported by Brotherhood-affiliated charities and social institutions that had already gained a strong foothold in the occupied territories. The acronym \\"Hamas\\" first appeared in 1987 in a leaflet that accused the Israeli intelligence services of undermining the moral fiber of Palestinian youth as part of Mossad's recruitment of what Hamas termed \\"collaborators.\\" Nonetheless, Israeli military and intelligence was still focused on Fatah, and continued to maintain contacts with Gaza Islamic activists. Numerous Islamist leaders, including senior Hamas founder Mahmoud Zahar, met with Yitzhak Rabin as part of \\"regular consultations\\" between Israeli officials and Palestinians not linked to the PLO. Hamas carried out its first attack against Israel in 1989, abducting and killing two soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces immediately arrested Yassin and sentenced him to life in prison, and deported 400 Hamas activists, including Zahar, to South Lebanon, which at the time was occupied by Israel. During this time Hamas built a relationship with Hezbollah. From 1987 to 1991, Hamas campaigned for the wearing of the hijab alongside other measures, including insisting women stay at home be segregated from men, and the promotion of polygamy. In the course of this campaign women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed, with the result that the hijab was being worn 'just to avoid problems on the streets'.Rubenberg, C., Palestinian Women: Patriarchy and Resistance in the West Bank (USA, 2001) p.230‚Äì231  The 1990s  Hamas's military branch, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was created in 1991.Martyrdom, Not Suicide: The Legality of Hamas' Bombings in the Mid-1990s in Modern Islamic Jurisprudence By M.A. Philipp Holtmann, p. 13 Although the Brigades are an integral part of Hamas, they operate independently, and at times contrary to Hamas policy.al- Qassam Brigades: Details of the organisation Australian Government National Security August 18, 2012 During the 1990s the al-Qassam Brigades conducted numerous attacks against civilians and the Israeli military.

The Second Intifada  Al-Qassam Brigades militants were among the armed groups that launched both military-style attacks and suicide bombings against Israeli civilian and military targets during the Second Intifada, also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada (, IntifƒÅat El Aqa; , IntifƒÅdat El-Aqtzah), which began in late September 2000. This Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories was much more violent than the First Intifada.

Pages 223‚Äì238 The immediate trigger for the Second Intifada is disputed, but a more general cause, writes U.S. political science professor Jeremy Pressman, was \\"popular Palestinian discontent [that] grew during the Oslo peace process because the reality on the ground did not match the expectations created by the peace agreements.\\"The Second Intifada: Background and Causes of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Jeremy Pressman, Fall 2003 (pdf) Hamas would be the beneficiary of this growing discontent in the 2006 Palestinian Authority legislative elections.  2004 ‚Äì A 10-year truce  In January 2004, Hamas leader Yassin said that the group would end armed resistance against Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, and that restoring Palestinians' \\"historical rights\\" (relating to the 1948 Palestinian exodus) \\"would be left for future generations.\\"Running out of time Al-Ahram Weekly, January 29 ‚Äì February 4, 2004 On January 25, 2004, senior Hamas official Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi offered a 10-year truce, or hudna, in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the complete withdrawal by Israel from the territories captured in the 1967 Six-Day War. Al-Rantissi stated that Hamas had come to the conclusion that it was \\"difficult to liberate all our land at this stage, so we accept a phased liberation.\\"Israel rejects 'insincere' Hamas offer of 10-year truce The Independent January 27, 2004 Israel immediately dismissed al-Rantissi's statements as insincere and a smokescreen for military preparations. Yassin was killed in a targeted killing on March 22, 2004, by an Israeli air strike,Fury as Gaza buries Hamas leader BBC News, April 19, 2004 and al-Rantisi was killed by a similar air strike on April 18, 2004.Hamas chief killed in air strike BBC News, March 22, 2004 From the time of an attack on the Israeli southern town of Be'er Sheva in August 2004, in which 15 people were killed and 125 wounded, a truce was generally observed. Hamas violated it in August 2005, with an attack on the same bus station, wounding seven, and in several attacks on Israeli motorists‚Äîkilling six. At the end of January 2004, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell mandated Steve Cohen, a U.S. official, to meet with Hamas officials, according to the French newspaper Le Canard encha√Æn√©. The mission was not only to inform the U.S. about the Hamas objectives, according to the newspaper, but also to evaluate if it could represent a counterbalance to al-Qaeda. In exchange for such cooperation, according to Le Canard, Hamas officials asked for the end of extrajudicial targeted killings carried out against them by the Israeli military.Les tr√®s secr√®tes 'relations' Isra√´l-Hamas (The very secret Israel- Hamas 'relations'), Le Canard Encha√Æn√©, February 1, 2006 (issue n¬∞4449) While Hamas boycotted the 2005 Palestinian presidential election, it did participate in the 2005 municipal elections organized by Yasser Arafat in the occupied territories. In those elections it won control of over one third of Palestinian municipal councils, besting Fatah, which had traditionally been \\"the biggest force in Palestinian politics\\". With this electoral success behind it, Hamas contested the 2006 elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council as the main component of the List of Change and Reform.  2005 ‚Äì Israel's unilateral disengagement plan  In 2004, in a prelude to Israel's unilateral disengagement plan from the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces carried out a number of military attacks on Gaza cities and refugees camps, seeking to draw out and kill Hamas-affiliated gunmen. Awareness of high casualties during such incursions led the Hamas leadership to instruct its activists to avoid putting themselves needlessly in the line of fire. On September 12, 2005, IDF withdrew from the Gaza Strip and declared an official end to Israeli military rule in Gaza, though Israel still retained control of the airspace and of the sea. However, the Palestinian Authority argued that the occupation was on- going, as complete sovereignty includes control of both airspace and seaways. The Gaza Strip was called a \\"lawless open-air prison\\". Hamas claimed that this unilateral withdrawal was a victory for its armed struggle and pledged to liberate all the occupied territories, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Fatah, on the other hand, viewed Ariel Sharon's unilateral plan as proof of the Palestinians' failure to obtain international recognition. Both criticized the disengagement plan, citing Sharon's simultaneous encouragement of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including Ma'ale Adummim, a large settlement east of Jerusalem. In April 2005, an advisor of Benjamin Netanyahu, principal right-wing opponent of Ariel Sharon, secretly negotiated with a Hamas representative, according to the Le Canard encha√Æn√©. The meeting was about the \\"possibility of an administrative co-gestion with the Hamas in the occupied territories\\", which is already the case in some Hamas-controlled cities of the West Bank, according to the French newspaper, which continued saying that: \\"But, in both sides, participants to such a dialogue keeps their mouth shut (bouche cousue). It is impossible to admit that one has met and negotiated with his sworn enemy.\\"  January 2006 ‚Äì Winning the legislative election  While Hamas had boycotted the January 2005 presidential election, during which Mahmoud Abbas was elected to replace Yasser Arafat, it did participate in the municipal elections held between January and May 2005, in which it took control of Beit Lahia and Rafah in the Gaza Strip and Qalqilyah in the West Bank. The January 2006 legislative elections marked another victory for Hamas, which gained the majority of seats, defeating the ruling Fatah party. The \\"List of Change and Reform\\", as Hamas presented itself, obtained 42.9% of the vote and 74 of the 132 seats. = Political decisions, and consequences on economy = The result of the election was regarded as a major setback for governments attempting to mediate the ongoing Israeli- Palestinian conflict. The George W. Bush administration immediately declared that it would not deal with Hamas until it renounced its support of suicide bombings and violence, and accepted Israel's right to exist. Israeli president Moshe Katsav and Israel's ex‚Äìprime minister Shimon Peres both said that if Hamas would accept Israel's right to exist and give up violence, Israel should negotiate with the organization. President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would not support any efforts to cut off financial assistance to the Palestinians, stating that Hamas gained power by democratic means. He invited some Hamas leaders to Moscow beginning of March 2006, and in May, repeated that cutting funds to the Hamas was a \\"mistake\\". The US and the EU cut all funds to the Palestinian Authority, with only Russia warning against the potential dangers of cutting out the PA from any Western support. The EU (which gives $500 million per year to the PA) announced that future aid to the Palestinians was tied to \\"Three Principles\\" outlined by the international community‚ÄîHamas must renounce violence, it must recognize Israel's right to exist, and it must express clear support for the Middle East peace process, as outlined in the 1993 Oslo Accords. Hamas did not seem to be ready to accept such conditions, and rejected them as \\"unfair\\".\\"Hamas rejects 'unfair' aid demand\\" , BBC News, January 31, 2006 At best, they would be ready to accept the Arab Peace Initiative formulated on March 28, 2002, during the Arab League Beirut Summit: full normalization of relations with Israel in exchange for Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 internationally recognized borders, implying Israeli evacuation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and the return of all Palestinian refugees and their descendants. Furthermore, the US has imposed a financial blockade on the PA's banks, impeding some of the Arab League's funds (e.g. Saudi Arabia and Qatar) from being transferred to the PA. Israel, on the other side, decided to cut transfers of the $55 million tax-receipts of the PA that it receives on the PA's behalf, since the PA did not have any access point to receive taxes. On February 19, 2006, interim Israeli Prime minister Ehud Olmert, who called the PA a \\"terrorist authority\\", decided to stop transfer of the $55 million tax- receipts to the PA, which accounts for a third of the PA's budget (two thirds of its proper budget) and insure the wages of 165,000 Palestinian civil servants (among them 60,000 security and police officers). Israel had already done that in 1991 and 1992, but international aid had covered up the budgetary losses. Israel also decided to increase controls on check-points, but finally decided against blocking Palestinians from commuting between Gaza and the West Bank and from prohibiting them to work in Israel. Criticizing these measures, moderate Labor leader Amir Peretz said that they were \\"indirect ways\\" to \\"get around Hamas and strengthen moderate forces\\" among the Palestinians. In May 2006, following a World Bank report about the Palestinian economy, the Quartet on the Middle East (the United States, Russia, European Union, and the United Nations) agreed to transfer funds directly to the Palestinian population. Israeli minister of foreign affairs, Tzipi Livni, said the measure was \\"acceptable\\", while PA minister of foreign affairs, Mahmoud Zahar, welcomed the promise of aid but criticised attempts to bypass the PA: \\"We appreciate every effort in order to help the Palestinian people by legal channels... and the legal channel is the Palestinian Authority, whether the presidency or the government,\\".\\"Palestinians to get interim aid\\" , BBC News, May 10, 2006 The World Bank had already compared the 2001 and 2002 economic recession, due to the Second Intifada and Israel's refusal to transfer tax receipts, to the 1929 economic crisis. The UN underlined that unemployment, which was estimated to 23% in 2005, would increase to 39% in 2006, while poverty, estimated at 44%, would increase to 67% in 2006. According to a World Bank report published on May 7, 2006, the delay in paying the PA's civil servants‚Äîwho had not received their wages since March 2006‚Äîwas dangerous both on social and security plans. This convinced the United States to accept the EU proposal, supported by Russia and the Arab countries, of finding a way to transfer funds to the Palestinian society without passing by the Palestinian Authority. The Quartet on the Middle East thus accepted, on May 9, 2006, an \\"international temporary mechanism of limited range and length\\" = Last Fatah measures = Before the Israeli decision to cut transfer of tax receipts, the Palestinian Assembly passed legislation giving to the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, the power to appoint a court that could veto legislation passed by the new Hamas- led parliament to be sworn in start of February. The constitutional court would veto legislation deemed in violation of the Palestinians' Basic Law, a forerunner to the Palestinian constitution. Palestinian deputies also backed a decree that automatically makes members of the incoming parliament members of the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) parliament in exile. Unlike the Hamas charter, the PLO charter recognises the legitimacy of Israel. = Hamas' declarations since the 2006 legislative elections = Hamas has omitted its call for the destruction of Israel from its election manifesto, calling instead for \\"the establishment of an independent state whose capital is Jerusalem,\\". On February 8, Hamas head Khaled Mashal speaking in Cairo clarified that \\"Anyone who thinks Hamas will change is wrong\\". However, on February 13, 2006, in an interview in Russian newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, the same Khaled Mashal declared that Hamas would stop armed struggle against Israel if it recognized the 1967 borders, withdrew itself from all Palestinian occupied territories (including the West Bank and East Jerusalem), and recognized Palestinian rights that would include the \\"right of return\\". This was the first time that Hamas even talked about an eventual stop to armed struggle. But Mashal continued to refuse to acknowledge the Road map for peace, adopted by the Quartet in June 2003, \\"since nobody respects it\\". The Road map projected the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in 2005. The Palestinian Authority's Al-Hayat Al-Jadeeda conducted a poll in 2006 that showed that 84% of Palestinians support a peace deal with Israel, based on the responses of \\"863 Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and West Bank,\\" and that more than 75% of the peace-deal supporters voted for Hamas. In April 2006, Henry Siegman, former director of the American Jewish Committee, stated that according to \\"a prominent senior member of Hamas's Political Committee\\" Hamas is prepared to explicitly recognize the state of Israel. \\"Members of Hamas's political directorate do not preclude significant changes over time in their policies toward Israel and in their founding charter, including recognition of Israel, and even mutual minor border adjustments. Such changes depend on Israel's recognition of Palestinian rights. Hamas will settle for nothing less than full reciprocity.\\" These sentiments \\"are in striking contrast to the odiousness of Hamas's founding charter,\\" said Siegman. Hamas: The Last Chance for Peace? By Henry Siegman, New York Review of Books, April 27, 2006 In May 2006, Hamas leaders threatened a new Intifada, as well as to decapitate anyone who tried to bring down their cabinet.Abu Toameh, Khaled. Hamas armed force readies for action, The Jerusalem Post, May 6, 2006. = Cabinet formation = Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei and his cabinet resigned, leaving Hamas to form a new government, which was completely formed on March 20. On February 19, Hamas had chosen Ismail Haniya as Prime minister of the PA, and on the same day the government of Israel decided counter- measures against the new Hamas-led Palestinian Authority (suspension of $55 million transfer of tax-receipts). After the victory, Israeli human rights organizations called on Hamas to stop its terror campaign against civilians and to eschew violence as a tool to achieve a political solution. On March 20, 2006, Hamas unveiled its full cabinet list, placing loyal members in charge of all key ministries; of the 24 ministers appointed, the majority were Hamas (the others were independent or technocrats). Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah refused to join the Hamas government. The position of foreign minister was given to Mahmoud al-Zahar, a Gazan leader and target of previous targeted killing attempts by Israel. Saeed Seyam, another Hamas leader, was appointed interior minister, in charge of multiple security agencies. Hamas member and engineer Ala el-Deen Al-Araj was appointed economics minister. The position of finance minister was given to Omar Abdel-Razeq, Hamas election official and economics professor from the West Bank. In his interview to The Sunday Telegraph, the newly appointed chief of the Palestinian security services Jamal Abu Samhadana stated: \\"We have only one enemy. They are Jews. We have no other enemy. I will continue to carry the rifle and pull the trigger whenever required to defend my people.\\" However, president Mahmoud Abbas retained official control over the Palestinian security services. = Tensions between Fatah and Hamas = After the formation of the Hamas cabinet on March 20, 2006, tensions progressively rose in the Gaza Strip between Fatah and Hamas militants. In May 2006, The Sunday Times reported that Israeli security sources claimed they had uncovered a Hamas plot to assassinate president Mahmoud Abbas.Mahnaimi, Uzi. Israel foils plot to kill Palestinian president , The Sunday Times, May 7, 2006. This was officially denied by a Hamas spokesman, while Mahmoud Abbas' spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeina, described the report as \\"totally untrue\\".\\"Un complot visant Abbas aurait √©t√© d√©jou√© grace aux Isra√©liens\\", L'Orient-Le Jour, May 8, 2006. On May 8, three Palestinians were killed and 10 wounded in clashes in southern Gaza, near Khan Yunis, between rival Hamas and Fatah gunmen. The PA, confronted to the Quartet's blockade and Israel's refusal to hand out the $55 million in monthly tax revenues impedes it from paying its 165,000 employees. On May 6 and 7, hundreds of Palestinians demonstrated in Gaza and the West Bank demanding payment of their wages. Although this inter- Palestinian incident had been one of the most serious since January 2006, tension had been slowly risen with the \\"economic squeeze\\" on the PA. Twelve people were killed during the first days of October 2006 in armed clashes between Fatah, and the Hamas Interior ministry police. These clashes started when the interior ministry militia forcibly dispersed a gathering of Policemen demonstrating against unpaid wages. The Fatah-affiliated Al-Asqa brigades have threatened to kill Hamas leaders including Khaled Meshal, Saeed Seyam and Youssef al-Zahar. The Al-Asqa brigade kidnapped but then released a senior official in the Finance ministry. = Agreement and preservation of national unity = On June 27, Hamas and Fatah reached an agreement on the prisoners' document, which included the forming of a national unity government. On February 2007 Saudi-sponsored negotiations in Mecca produced agreement on a signed by Mahmoud Abbas on behalf of Fatah and Khaled Mashal on behalf of Hamas. The new government was called on to achieve Palestinian national goals as approved by the Palestine National Council, the clauses of the Basic Law and the National Reconciliation Document (the \\"Prisoners' Document\\") as well as the decisions of the Arab summit. In March 2007, the Palestinian Legislative Council established a national unity government, with 83 representatives voting in favor and three against. Government ministers were sworn in by Abu Mazen, the chairman on the Palestinian Authority, in at a ceremony held simultaneously in Gaza and Ramallah. In June that year, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip from the national unity government after forcing out Fatah. = 2006 Gaza‚ÄìIsrael conflict = On June 9, during or shortly after an Israeli operation, an explosion occurred on a busy Gaza beach, killing eight Palestinian civilians. It was initially assumed that Israeli shellings were responsible for the killings, although Israeli government officials later denied this. Prompted by the recent events Hamas formally withdrew from its 16-month ceasefire on June 10, and took responsibility for the ongoing Qassam rocket attacks being launched from Gaza into Israel. On June 24, Israeli operatives apprehended Osama and Mustafa Muamar in the Gaza Strip, alleged by Israel to be Hamas members. On June 25, a Hamas attack in Israel resulted in the deaths of two Israeli soldiers and the capture of Israeli Corporal Gilad Shalit. Israel then launched Operation Summer Rains on June 28 to recover the captured soldier. The ongoing operation initially consisted of heavy bombardment of bridges, roads, and the only power station in Gaza. Several PA facilities were also bombed, such as the Palestinian Interior Ministry and the office of the Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniya. On June 29, Israel captured 64 Hamas officials. Amongst them were eight Palestinian Authority cabinet ministers and up to twenty members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, as well as heads of regional councils, and the mayor of Qalqilyah and his deputy. At least a third of the Hamas cabinet was captured and held by Israel. On August 6 Israeli forces detained the Hamas' Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Aziz Dweik, at his home in the West Bank. In November 2006, a 64-year-old woman executed a suicide bombing mission, killing herself and slightly injuring 2 Israeli soldiers. Hamas claimed responsibility and its spokesman, Abu Obeida declared that \\"both Palestinian men and women are committed to battling the Israelis\\". = 2007 ‚Äì end-of-truce with Israel = On April 24, 2007, \\"six rockets were launched from Gaza [by Hamas], two of which landed in Israel\\". According to Bloomberg news, Palestinians said the rockets were in response to Israeli military action over the previous weekend which had \\"killed as many as eight people in the West Bank, where there is no cease-fire, and one in Gaza.\\" Most of the dead were militants, but Palestinians said at least two civilians, including a 17-year-old girl, were killed. Hamas announced that it considered the truce to be over. The rocket attack, which came on Israel's 59th Independence Day, caused no damage or injury. However, it marked the first time Hamas openly acknowledged firing shells toward Israel since agreeing to a cease-fire along the Gaza-Israel border in November. Abu Ubeida, a spokesman for Hamas' armed wing, told foreign journalists that \\"there is no truce between us and the occupation, the occupation destroyed the truce from the moment it started, we did not trust the intentions of the occupation from the beginning.\\" Abu Ubeida told the Voice of Palestine radio station that \\"the cease-fire has been over for a long time, and Israel is responsible for that.\\"Hamas claims end to truce, fires rockets at Israel USA Today 2007-04-24 \\"This is a message to the Zionist enemy that our strikes will continue,\\" Abu Obeida said of the rocket fire. \\"We are ready to kidnap more and more, and kill more and more of your soldiers.\\" Israeli soldier Cpl. Gilad Shalit's kidnappers demand the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including veterans and those involved in killing or wounding Israelis. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on April 23, 2007, that freeing soldiers is important to the government, but that it would not repeat \\"mistakes made in the past\\" by releasing violent prisoners who then carried out more attacks against Israelis. But Olmert said there would be \\"no escape in the end from making a difficult decision\\" on trading prisoners for the captured Israeli troops. Hamas militants stated on April 24, 2007, that they had launched 40 rockets and 70 mortar shells. The Israeli military said it could confirm six rockets and eight mortars. Two of the rockets fell in Israel, north of the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army said‚Äìthey added that the attack was a diversion for an attempt by Hamas gunmen to kidnap IDF soldier. = Hamas-Fatah conflict = After the formation of the Hamas-led cabinet on March 20, 2006, tensions between Fatah and Hamas militants progressively rose in the Gaza strip, leading to demonstrations, violence, and repeated attempts at a truce. Israeli intelligence warned Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas had planned to kill him at his office in Gaza. According to a Palestinian source close to Abbas, Hamas considers president Abbas to be a barrier to its complete control over Palestine and decided to kill him. In a statement to Al Jazeera, Hamas leader Mohammed Nazzal, accused Abbas of being party to besieging and isolating the Hamas-led government.Mahnaimi, Uzi. Israel foils plot to kill Palestinian president , The Sunday Times, May 7, 2006 On June 9, 2006, during an Israeli artillery operation, an explosion occurred on a busy Gaza beach, killing eight Palestinian civilians. It was assumed that Israeli shellings were responsible for the killings, but Israeli government officials denied this. Hamas formally withdrew from its 16-month ceasefire on June 10, taking responsibility for the subsequent Qassam rocket attacks launched from Gaza into Israel. Hostage Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit on Hamas poster, reads: \\"Our heroes prisoners may we have a new Gilad each year\\" and down :\\"They (Palestinian prisoners) are not alone\\" On June 29, following a joint incursion by Fatah, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas in which two Israeli soldiers were killed and corporal Gilad Shalit was captured, Israel captured 64 Hamas officials. Among them were 8 Palestinian Authority cabinet ministers and up to 20 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, as well as heads of regional councils, and the mayor of Qalqilyah and his deputy. At least a third of the Hamas cabinet was captured and held by Israel. On August 6 Israeli forces detained the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Hamas member Aziz Dweik, at his home in the West Bank. These arrests, along with other events, including the subsequent arrest of the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, effectively prevented the Hamas-dominated legislature that resulted from the preceding elections from functioning during most of its term. On February 2007, Saudi- sponsored negotiations in Mecca produced agreement on a signed by Mahmoud Abbas on behalf of Fatah and Khaled Mashal on behalf of Hamas. The new government was called on to achieve Palestinian national goals as approved by the Palestine National Council, the clauses of the Basic Law and the National Reconciliation Document (the \\"Prisoners' Document\\") as well as the decisions of the Arab summit. In March 2007, the Palestinian Legislative Council established a national unity government, with 83 representatives voting in favor and three against. Government ministers were sworn in by Abu Mazen, the chairman on the Palestinian Authority, in at a ceremony held simultaneously in Gaza and Ramallah. In June that year, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip from the national unity government after forcing out Fatah. In June 2007, renewed fighting broke out between Hamas and Fatah.

The Egyptian press stated that the firing of the rockets from Egyptian territory by Hamas or by organizations cooperating with it constituted the crossing of a red line.

Early life and career Born in Cordele, Georgia, on December 7, 1941 (the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor), Ray was one of five brothers. He left high school in 1959 and joined the United States Army from Atlanta for a three-year term of service. Only two months after finishing his enlistment, he rejoined the Special Forces. Ray excelled in his training, such as that for HALO jumping, and was selected for Officer Candidate School. Upon graduation he became a commissioned officer. Vietnam War Sent to Vietnam in early June 1966 as a first lieutenant, Ray led a platoon in Company A of the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. Shortly after Ray's arrival in the country, his company took part in an operation in the Ia Drang Valley to cut off North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces entering Vietnam from Cambodia. Ray set up a command post on a small hill, then established listening posts throughout the large area his platoon was tasked with covering. On June 19, one of these listening posts came under intense fire from a company-sized NVA force and was cut off from the rest of the platoon. After learning that no reinforcements were available from his company commander, Ray gathered the rest of his platoon and set off through one mile (1.6 km) of dense jungle to rescue the ten men in the besieged post. With his soldiers firing in \\"small, frequent bursts\\" to make themselves appear like a larger force, the unit was able to break through and join the trapped men. Ray directed his soldiers in the defense of their post as the NVA force regrouped and resumed the attack. When a squad sent out to destroy a hostile machine gun nest became pinned down, Ray stormed the emplacement himself, killing the four gunners with his grenades and shotgun. He then rescued a medic and a wounded man who had come under intense fire by silencing the hostile position with a grenade. As an NVA grenade landed near two of his soldiers, Ray shielded them with his body, suffering shrapnel wounds to his legs and feet. Immediately after, he was shot in the legs by a machine gun, which he then destroyed with his last grenade. Although his lower body was momentarily paralyzed by his injuries, Ray continued to lead the platoon until a lull in the fighting allowed them to withdraw. He intended to stay behind and provide covering fire, but his sergeant carried him to the extraction point after the rest of the unit had escaped. Ray was evacuated to Pleiku and then Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he received medical treatment for the next six months. He was promoted to captain and by 1970 was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia. On May 14, 1970, President Richard Nixon formally presented Ray with the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Ia Drang Valley. Ray retired from the Army for medical reasons in 1980 as a lieutenant colonel, having served a total of three tours in Vietnam. Civilian life While still in the Army, Ray graduated from the University of Tampa and received a master's degree in public administration from the University of Oklahoma. After leaving the military, he settled in Florida and established a career as a real estate broker. He founded Ronald E. Ray, Inc., a real estate development and brokerage company. Through the White House Fellows program, Ray served as a special assistant to the United States Secretary of Commerce from 1974 to 1975. He supported the Republican Party, and worked on the successful presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush in 1984 and 1988, respectively. In 1989, President Bush appointed him as an assistant secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a position Ray would hold until 1993. Ray is a former president of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.

Founded in 1802 by Louis-Marie Baudouin the school was re- fashioned an \\"international college\\" in 2002. The school's language of instruction is English, and it prepares pupils for British GCSEs and A-levels, with the French Brevet and Baccalaur√©at as options. The College claims to be a traditional English school in France. Although pupils come from Britain and other English-speaking countries there are also more and more pupils from France. In this international environment, modern languages are particularly strong, with many boys taking GCSE languages (French, German, Spanish, English) one or two years early. Older boys often speak several languages fluently. History Chavagnes en Paillers has a long history of association with England, and with a general attitude of welcoming outsiders. The motto on the official arms of the village comes from the 133rd Psalm (Ecce Quam Bonum): 'Habitare fratres in unum' (Behold how good it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.) Pope Clement V, the first of Four 'Chavagnes Popes' The land on which the college is built, near the site of a Roman villa, was given to a community of Benedictine monks in the thirteenth century by the Anglo- French family Harpedan de Belleville, who then ruled the area. The monastery built at that time was dedicated to St Anthony of Egypt (also called St Anthony the Great), the founder of monasticism. The monastery received a canonical visitation from a Papal Legate, Bertrand de Got in the late 12th century. He subsequently became the first Pope at Avignon, Clement V. Charles X of France, who authorised the 'Ecclesiastical School of Chavagnes' in 1825. Venerable Louis Marie Baudouin.In the years that followed, Chavagnes saw many changes and much upheaval. In the nineteenth century, its walls housed the first junior seminary in France after the Revolution, founded by the Venerable Louis-Marie Baudouin in 1802. Father Baudouin recounted a prophecy whispered to him by a dying priest, renowned for his sanctity: \\"Il y aura toujours un s√©minaire √† Chavagnes\\"R.P. Yves Chaille, Histoire du petit s√©minaire de Chavagnes-en-Paillers (\\"There will always be a seminary in Chavagnes\\"). This legend would later inspire several successful attempts to keep the seminary open against the will of the Emperor Napoleon, the Fourth Republic and the Nazis. Already recognised by Napoleon, and under the authority of the diocesan bishop, it received a royal charter from Charles X in 1825, as the ‚ÄòEcclesiastical School of Chavagnes‚Äô, during the brief period of the restored Bourbon monarchy (1824‚Äì30). The buildings were confiscated from the Church in 1905 as part of the anti-clerical crackdown throughout France. The priests then involved with educating the boys at Chavagnes were exiled to Shaftesbury in Dorset. In 1912 the buildings were bought back by a local aristocrat, the Comte de Suzannet, and reopened as a junior seminary, much to the chagrin of the Paris authorities. The college was shared between German soldiers and junior seminarians during World War II, housing a small garrison and a military hospital. A machine-gun was placed in the clock tower, dominating the village, but the Nazi soldiers turned a blind eye to more than 50 Jewish children sheltered by local families until the liberation. The villagers were so good at keeping a secret regarding the hidden Jewish children that the information only emerged in the 1990s.Odette Meyers, Doors to Madame Marie, Washington 1997. Chavagnes of the Popes Shortly after the Second World War the college (then the Petit S√©minaire de Chavagnes) received the visit of Angelo Cardinal Roncalli, Papal Nuncio in Paris. The then Mayor, Mr Gilbert de Guerry de Beauregard, gave a welcome speech in which he alluded to the previous visit of a Papal Legate in the 12th Century and mentioned that the last one had become a Pope. He suggested that Cardinal Roncalli might also share the same destiny. Roncalli became Pope John XXIII a few years later. In an interesting turn of events, the Pope of the day, Pius XII, sent a long letter of greeting to the people of Chavagnes, referring to the historic faith of the people of the Vend√©e area, in the wake of this visit. The letter was signed by a substitute, by the name of Martini, later Pope Paul VI. In 1997, as had happened many times before in the history of Chavagnes, the building closed its doors for a time. In 1999 the buildings housed 50 refugees from Kosovo. Finally, in September 2002, with the support of the local bishop, a group of English, American, Australian and Irish teachers, led by Ferdi McDermott, reopened the school but with a different, international emphasis. Teachers of 1954, Chavagnes. Master and pupils 2012, Chavagnes. In 2004, two founding Masters of Chavagnes International College, Robert Asch and Ferdi McDermott, were invited to visit Cardinal Ratzinger in Rome. Cardinal Ratzinger blessed rosaries for the boys at the college and expressed the hope that his forthcoming retirement would enable him to work more closely with his visitors. Cardinal Ratzinger became Pope, as Benedict XVI, making him the fourth Pope with a particular link to this remote French village and with its little \\"ecclesiastical school\\". In one of his last acts as Pope, Benedict XVI gave the title Venerable to Father Baudouin (the founder of the Petit S√©minaire de Chavagnes) on 20 December 2012. Arms and motto Heraldic achievement of Chavagnes International College The arms of the College combine those on the second Great Seal of King Richard I of England, used by his successors until 1340 with the French fleurs-de-lis and the ecclesiastical mitre: \\"Dexter, Gules three lions passant guardant Or; impaled with, sinister, Azure, an episcopal mitre between two fleurs-de-lis Or‚Äù. Richard I of England, Duke of Normandy (as Richard IV), Duke of Aquitaine, Duke of Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Count of Nantes, and Overlord of Brittany (reigned 1189-1199) ruled Poitou at the time of the foundation of the original monastery in Chavagnes, and founded other monasteries himself in the surrounding area, including a Priory of Grandmont. These arms of England are combined with the right-hand side representing the recognition of the French monarchy under Charles X (by the fleurs de lis) and the patronage of Bishops of Lu√ßon (with the mitre) to this day. As well as representing England and France, three other levels of symbolism exist in the coat of arms. The two sides of the arms may be taken to represent allegorically the Blessed Trinity and the Blessed Virgin Mary; also on the one hand the theological virtues, on the other the virtue of purity, supported by the Sacraments of the Church. Lastly the supporting lions symbolise heroic courage while the lilies symbolise beauty and the mitre truth and goodness: three values that the courage of the lions must serve if it is to be truly heroic. Echoing these sentiments, the full heraldic achievement features two croziers (one abbatial and one episcopal) and two lions rampant. The college's motto is In electis tuis mitte radices, 'Put down roots in those Thou hast chosen'. It is a reference to the Book of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Chapter 24, verse 13 in which Wisdom is bidden by God to take root among his Elect, the people of Israel. On a nineteenth-century statue of the Virgin and Child, under the devotion Our Lady of the Sceptre in the front Quad of Chavagnes, an inscription attributes the words to the Child Jesus, addressing His mother: 'in electis meis mitte radices' ('put down your roots in my Elect'). Buildings Rear Quad at ChavagnesFront Quad at Chavagnes. There are no surviving vestiges of Roman or medieval buildings on the site, with the possible exception of a small piece of stained glass, bearing an episcopal coat of arms. This is situated in the Father Baudouin memorial chapel, one of three chapels on the site. All the other buildings date from between about 1700 and the 1960s, with most built between 1820 and 1880. The main building, in the form of a letter H, with various later extensions, is a typical 19th century religious/scholastic building, with a large number of windows on all sides. The College clocktower contains a carillon of 13 bells which may be played with a system of levers. The original makers of the clock (circa 1850), Lussault, are currently repairing it and recasting one of the bells. The neo- gothic Chapel was consecrated on October 24, 1866 and dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. It contains five full-size stained glass windows portraying Pentecost, the Finding in the Temple, the Coronation of the Virgin + The Immaculate Conception (with Pius IX pictured), 'Suffer the little children to come unto me' and the Presentation of Our Lady in the Temple, with Ss Joachim and Anna. The sanctuary is oak-panelled with large statues of twelve saints providing a typical gothic 'cloud of witness' as featured in many cathedrals. The organ, built in the 1880s by the Nantes firm Debierre, is listed in the supplementary register of Historic Monuments. It has two manuals and some interesting extra features, such as a rather dramatic 'storm pedal' which needs to be used sparingly. The marble altar features sculpted panels depicting our Lord with the Evangelists and Moses distributing manna to the children of Israel. This used to be part of a larger High Altar which was later dismantled to make the usual altar facing the people. The large and impressive Stations of the Cross, framed in gothic style, are rather modern in execution. They are painted by a little-known artist, Alfred Sauvage, active in the early 20th century. There are two other smaller chapels on site: one dedicated to St Joseph, and the Father Baudouin Memorial chapel, dedicated to our Lady. Both are mid-nineteenth century neo-gothic. Totalling about ., the buildings are too large for the college's current needs and only about 35% is currently in daily use. The buildings stand on about 2.5 hectares of land. The College sports ground is situated about seven minutes' walk away. Masters The teaching staff at the college is mainly composed of Fellows who live in the college and commit to supporting the prayer-life of the institution in addition to their teaching. In addition there are several non-residential teaching staff, local volunteers and some Visiting Fellows. The college has a long-standing relationship with the University of Buckingham and makes use of the university's academic programmes to provide teacher training and ongoing Continuing professional development for its staff. The college is also a Corporate Member of the oldest professional body in education, the College of Teachers in London. The postgraduate research of the Fellows of the college, the organisation of conferences, various adult education projects in the Liberal Arts and other similar activities outside the scope of the main 11-18 school are part of the Chavagnes Studium, a kind of fledgling university community within the college. From 2016 the Chavagnes Studium is launching a post A-level programme of study in the Liberal Arts.http://www.chavagnes.org/studium Curriculum From September 2007 a bilingual policy was phased in at the lower end of the college. All boys in Year 7 are coached towards basic fluency in English/French and the lessons in other subjects are delivered in a bilingual setting, with most textbooks in English. Chavagnes is a Cambridge school and Years 7-9 follow the Cambridge Junior Secondary curriculum originated by Cambridge International Examinations. Boys in year 10, of whatever nationality, are given the option of sitting the French brevet exam, as well as the usual raft of Cambridge IGCSE examinations at 15 and 16. All tuition for the GCSE years (Years 10 and 11) and the A-level classes is exclusively in English. Extra-curricular activities include scouts, astronomy, drama, extra modern languages, a dining club for older boys, and a literary club. Boxing and compulsory poetry recitation (by heart) in various languages feature regularly. The college also plays host to a range of traditions with a particularly Catholic and/or English flavour: religious processions, the election of a boy bishop on St Nicholas Day, an annual 110 km pilgrimage on foot from Paris to Chartres, rising at dawn on May Day to welcome the summer, and rowing in coxed fours. Pupils wearing cassocks Liturgical choir Most boys sing in the Choir and learn Gregorian chant. Other repertoire includes Mozart, Bach and Handel, although renaissance polyphony tends to dominate. The Choir made a tour of Sweden in 2004, visited Sicily in summer 2008 the UK in summer 2009 and Rome in February 2012. In Holy Week 2014 the Choir made a pilgrimage from Tui to Santiago de Compostella (about 110 km on foot over 5 days.) En route they sang three concerts and also sang at a Solemn Mass in the Cathedral of Compostella. In February 2015 the Choir visited Riga, Latvia, where it sang at Sunday Mass in the Catholic Cathedral as well as the Basilique du Sacr√©-C≈ìur de Montmartre, in Paris, where it also sang at Solemn Sunday Mass. They have made two CDs: Les Choristes de Chavagnes in 2004 and \\"Chantons √† Chavagnes\\" in 2008. The Choir sings at Mass for Sundays and Feastdays and also sings concerts for local schools and old peoples' homes. House system The college's pupils are divided into four houses. Each house is named after a general of the Vend√©en uprising that took place in response to the French revolution: Charette (leaderhouse), Suzannet, Rochejacquelein and Cathelineau. Boys sit at house tables for meals and also participate in various inter-house competitions. Each house has a captain and vice captain. The house captain of each house wears a black gown over his school uniform, similar in design to an Oxford undergraduate gown, but with ribbon facings on the streamers in the appropriate house colour. The house captain is also responsible for the conduct of his house. Scouts de Chavagnes Chavagnes ScoutsThe College has its own independent Scout Troop, combining the traditions of English and French Catholic scouting, following the teaching of Father Jacques Sevin SJ, the Father of European Catholic Scouting and friend of Lord Baden Powell. The College Troop takes the name 'Scouts de Chavagnes' and is affiliated to the World Federation of Independent Scouts. Discipline and environment The boys, aged 10 to 18, live in community with the teachers. Access to TV and the Internet, CD players and iPods is limited. Mass is attended daily and prayers are said at different times throughout the day. The College describes itself as a 'voluntary community' and its discipline system is based on the presumption that boys fundamentally want to be there. Media coverage Pensionnat de Chavagnes participants in 2004, recreating a 1950s French school for French TV. The school has been the subject of several documentary programmes in the UK and France. It became quite famous in France in 2004 when its buildings were used in the summer holidays for the filming of a reality show called Le Pensionnat de Chavagnes in which children recreated a school from the 1950s for a month. The four-part series, based on the UK broadcast That'll Teach 'Em, attracted up to eight million viewers across France. Various articles have appeared in The Daily Telegraph, Sunday Times and other UK and French newspapers over the years. In June 2008 a Reuters article on the college was syndicated worldwide and attracted a great deal of attention. This was followed up by a special feature on Vatican Radio in July 2008. This focussed on the college as a 'Community of faith.'

The season premiered on February 18, 2008 as part of Jetix on Toon Disney; it would be the last season to air on both entities prior to the launch of Disney XD in February 2009. Synopsis For over 10,000 years, a spirit of pure evil known as Dai Shi has been locked away and safely guarded by the Pai Zhua - The Order of the Claw - a secretive Kung Fu clan. The Pai Zhua select their three top members, Jarrod, Theo Martin and Lily Chilman, to become the new guardians of Dai Shi. Jarrod's arrogant and bullying nature led to him being excluded and a rookie named Casey Rhodes is chosen instead. During the initiation ceremony Jarrod returns and attacks Master Mao, inadvertently breaking the vessel containing Dai Shi's essence as he does so. The freed Dai Shi kills Master Mao and takes over Jarrod's body who then escapes. The new guardians travel to the city of Ocean Bluff to seek their new master, and find him to be a man named Robert \\"R.J.\\" James - chef and owner of \\"Jungle Karma Pizza\\". After testing them R.J. grants them the powers and abilities of Jungle Fury Power Rangers, making them Earth's only hope to stop Dai Shi - who along with his Lieutenant Camille, other henchmen, and army of undead Rinshi warriors is attempting to take over the world and allow animals to rule over humans. Initially, R.J. acts only as Sensei and trainer to the Power Rangers, but as the series progresses he joins their ranks as the Jungle Fury Purple Wolf Ranger. During this time, they are also joined by Dominic \\"Dom\\" Hargan who studied with RJ, and Fran - originally a customer then employee of Jungle Karma Pizza. Dominic joins as the White Rhino Power Ranger, and Fran is enlisted to watch the monitors and advise of Rinshi attacks while RJ is with the other Power Rangers. Eventually, Camille is targeted by henchmen Scorch and Snapper who are jealous of her popularity with Dai Shi - although in reality it is Jarrod's own human spirit fighting against Dai Shi she is attracted to. As a result, she turns against both them and Dai Shi, enabling Jarrod to throw off its spirit control and the two join the Power Rangers who use their animal spirits finally to defeat Dai Shi and its forces. In the epilogue, a more mature and responsible Jarrod goes back to the Pai Zhua to begin his training again, followed by Camille, who later returns as a Power Ranger in her own right. Lily, Theo and RJ remain at Karma Pizza. Dominic and Fran backpack around the world, and Casey becomes a teacher at the Pai Zhua - with Jarrod and Camille among his students.

When the United States' President-elect MacArthur Foyle dies after the general election, but before the Electoral College has a chance to vote him into office, the media and the election process are swung into chaos.http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-399-13812-6 Synopsis On Election Day in 1996, The Republican presidential ticket of Foyle-Block wins enough states to receive 305 electoral votes, compared to 233 electoral votes for the Democratic ticket of Mueller-Vincent. Since 270 electoral votes are needed to win the Presidency, the issue of who should be the next President is thought resolved. However, President-elect Foyle dies only days after the election in a freak accident. The Republican party then promotes his running mate, Governor Theodore Block, to the top of the ticket. Governor Block quickly proves that he is a mental lightweight, his nickname being Teddy Blockhead, leading some to question his fitness for the presidency. One of those questioning Block's fitness to be president is Michigan elector Dorothy Ledger, one of those forgotten people lost in a party's political machine who seems unimportant‚Äîuntil the fate of an election hinges on her actions. Ledger publicly questions whether she is required to vote for Block, and in so doing sets off a political firestorm and a minor rebellion among some Republican electors. A series of missteps by Block further exacerbates the issue. Meanwhile, African-American preacher W. Dixon Mason and his supporters move toward endorsing their own favorite candidate, while Washington, D.C., \\"political powerbroker\\" Jack Petitcon, and his allies also attempt to control the process.http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-399-13812-6 Avi DuPour is a popular liberal-bashing radio host who provides commentary on the proceedings.http://www.ew.com/article/1995/09/15/book-review-peoples-choice- cautionary-tale Analysis The novel's plot exposes how much of a problem a potential rogue elephant (or donkey), also known as a maverick or faithless elector,http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/two-ticking-time-bombs-in-the- constitution/article_829c874a-e6de-5658-942c-fc10116f7ba0.html in the Electoral College could become. The Electoral College voters are composed largely of people no one has ever heard, chosen by the political parties from their membership lists (or, as in the novel, some retired officials well past their prime), and they vote to elect a president and vice president, bound for the most part, by their solemn word to vote for the candidate they are pledged to support. The situation Greenfield sets up demonstrates how, under the right conditions, electors and their votes can be manipulated by idealism, opportunism, and cynicism without reference to the voters who elected them, possibly even electing as President in December a person who was not even on the ballot in November. The book highlights the little known United States Constitution directives on how a United States President is elected. People within each state vote for electors who assemble in December to cast the binding vote to select the next president. There is very little law forcing electors to vote for the person that their state selected.https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral- college/provisions.html James Kirkpatrick praised the novel for highlighting this \\"metaphysical\\" bomb lurking in the Constitution.http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/two-ticking-time-bombs-in-the- constitution/article_829c874a-e6de-5658-942c-fc10116f7ba0.html Many of the characters are thought to have had real life counterparts at the time the novel was published.http://www.ew.com/article/1995/09/15/book-review-peoples- choice-cautionary-tale Reviews Publishers Weekly stated, \\"Characterization sometimes takes a back seat to plot machinations here but, for the most part, what The Player did for Hollywood, The People's Choice, in its unabashed flailing of the American system, does for presidential politics.http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-399-13812-6 Entertainment Weekly gave the novel a B-praised the premise of the book, however, stated the book failed to make anyone of the more than 90 characters in the book the emotional center of the novel. It also noted that as the United States has had incompetent presidents in the past, the scenario proposed in the novel is not the only way the United States can end up with an incompetent president. One of the marketing blurbs on the book's cover states: \\"Read this while it's still fiction.\\" Kirkus Reviews stated \\"Greenfield has had a field day with Washington's establishment, the media's feeding frenzies, idealogues whose ethics could most charitably be described as flexible, and other of federal government's less edifying pilot fish.

It is a combination of the former Peterborough Civic Hospital and St. Joseph's Health Centre, previously operating from those two locations in the City of Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. All acute care services were provided at 1 Hospital Drive (the former Civic Hospital), located in the Central-West part of the city, while chronic, rehabilitation and palliative care services, along with some out-patient medical and surgical services, were provided from the 384 Rogers Street site (the former St. Joseph's Health Centre) located in the \\"East City\\" or Ashburnham neighbourhood of Peterborough. Effective June 2008 all services of the PRHC (excluding some Outpatient Mental Health services and the Women's Health Care Centre) moved into a new hospital building located directly in front of the old Civic Hospital, across from the Nicholls Building, which continued to house some Outpatient Mental Health services (including the Schizophrenia Clinic, Family & Youth Clinic and Psychiatric Services for the Elderly) until 2010. In late 2010, all patient services, including the Women's Health Care Centre, were moved into the new hospital building. Demolition of the Nicholls building began in fall 2011 and was completed in December 2011. The hospital is affiliated with the Queen's University School of Medicine, and is a training site for the Family Medicine Residency Program. Service area The City of Peterborough (pop. 81,032 (2016)), located in Central-East Ontario, is one of the largest cities between the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and Ottawa, and is the business, culture, education, and health care centre of a greater region stretching from the Counties of Northumberland (south) to Haliburton (north), and the City of Kawartha Lakes (west) to Hastings County (east). The region covers a huge geographic area, and is home to a population of approximately 300,000. As a regional hospital, the PRHC receives many urgent and emergency transfers of seriously ill or injured patients from smaller hospitals in (and outside) its catchment area, including hospitals in Bancroft, Barry's Bay, Belleville, Campbellford, Cobourg, Haliburton, Lindsay, Minden Hills and Trenton. Peterborough Regional Health Centre is often accessed by ORNGE - both to incoming and outgoing patients. Staff and volunteers PRHC is the region's largest employer with a staff of approximately 2,400 and about 400 physicians with various privileges. The hospital has more than 600 volunteers.

Alan Wotherspoon speaking for the board of directors refused to say whether Tremblay quit or was fired and would only say that it was a human resources issue. Two weeks later three more executives at the hospital were also no longer working there, including Arnel Schiratti, Cathy van Leipsig and Michael Moore. The hospital refused to say whether they were fired or quit. The hospital advised the community that it was in the process of reviewing its finances. A later audit of the hospital‚Äôs financial records revealed that a total of $57 million was accounted for incorrectly on the hospital's balance sheet, rather than on its statement of operations as usable revenue. Members of the local community and the Peterborough Health Coalition were upset at the secrecy surrounding events at the hospital and the fact budget cuts had been taking place for years. In October 2012 the lawyer heading the effort to start a class-action lawsuit over the breach of privacy of more than 280 patients at Peterborough Regional Health Centre said he will seek to launch the action before the end of the year. Several of the affected patients have spoken publicly about having their medical records accessed by hospital staff who weren‚Äôt involved in treating them. Some have said they had been the victims of earlier breaches at the hospital last year, and that they received letters in the fall informing them of the situation. Helipad The hospital has a ground level helipad located next to the hospital. A short walkway provides access from the helipad to transfer patients to the emergency room.

Named after Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, she was the only U.S. Navy vessel to bear the name. Construction LST-1154 was laid down on 4 August 1945 at the Boston Navy Yard; launched on 19 July 1946; sponsored by Mrs. Wilder D. Baker; and commissioned on 24 May 1949 with LCDR James W. McBrier in command.After recommissioning as an AVB in 1962, CDR Courtland Babcock was in command. http://usstallahatchiecounty.com/history.html History From her commissioning until 1962, LST-1154 alternated assignments for the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet along the east coast of the United States with assignment to the 6th Fleet during periodic deployments to the Mediterranean. She was redesignated USS Tallahatchie County (LST-1154) on 1 July 1955. She was decommissioned at Charleston (SC) Naval Shipyard in 1960 in preparation for conversion to AVB-2. On 3 February 1962 her conversion was completed to an Advance Aviation Base Ship (one of two ships of the steam-powered LST-1153-class) and redesignated USS Tallahatchie County (AVB-2.) Her aft superstructure was extended forward and her forecastle built up; electronic antennas and a heavy king post were mounted amidships. As an AVB, Tallahatchie County was designed to provide command and logistic facilities to a squadron of P-2 Neptune antisubmarine patrol planes operating from an improvised land base in Souda Bay, Crete. Squadron equipment was carried in mobile vans, transported in Tallahatchie County's tank deck, and landed over her bow ramp. For the remainder of her career, Tallahatchie County provided support to aviation units in the Mediterranean. She was decommissioned on 3 January 1970 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 July 1970. Tallahatchie County was sold for scrapping to Contieri Navali Santa Maria of Genoa, Italy in July 1970.

They emerged as part of the anarcho-punk scene, developing a fast and aggressive hardcore punk style. The original line-up of Simon Greenham on vocals, Andy on guitar, Chaos (aka \\"Lice\\") on bass and Potts on drums recorded two EP's and a full LP for Riot City Records. In the process, they, along with fellow Bristolians Disorder and Stoke's Discharge, revolutionised the hardcore punk scene. In particular, the Japanese '80s hardcore punk bands were heavily influenced by Chaos UK and Disorder's brutal take on punk. Chaos UK's debut LP was notable in the fact that the band's label claimed it was the \\"fastest, noisiest LP in the cosmos\\" in the short lived \\"Punk Lives\\" magazine. Vocal duties on this recording were also handled by bassist Chaos. The mid-1980s saw an almost new line-up, with Chaos remaining the only original member. He was joined by Mower on vocals, Gabba on guitar (previously with Nottingham's The Seats of Piss), and Chuck on drums. Over the rest of the 1980s, Chaos UK were the mainstay and lynchpin of the UK hardcore punk scene playing many hundreds of shows around the world, including Japan (the first English punk band to do so, but with a stand-in drummer: Blackmore of Bristol punk band Lunatic Fringe), the United States, Mexico, and all over Europe.

Design and development The aircraft was designed by Ryszard Bartel, a chief designer of Samolot factory in Pozna≈Ñ. It was the first Polish design of a trainer plane. Initially it was known as Bartel M.2, then BM 2 (M was for designer's wife Maryla). The prototype was flown on 7 December 1926 in Pozna≈Ñ. In June 1927 it was shown at the first Aviation Exhibition in Warsaw. It was tested in 1927 and evaluated as quite good, but it was not built in series, because Bartel decided to design an improved aircraft, which resulted in the Bartel BM 4 trainer, which was produced in quantity. After flight testing, the prototype was removed from service. A distinguishing feature of the BM 2 and all Bartels was an upper wing of a shorter span, because the lower and upper wing halves were interchangeable (i.e. the lower wingspan included the width of the fuselage). Also Bartel put a stress on standardizing the construction materials used: steel pipes, metal sheet etc., in order to make production and repairs easier. A distinguishing feature of the BM 2 was the upper wing directly over the lower wing - unstaggered wings, while in later Bartel designs, the wings incorporate forward stagger - where the upper wing is mounted ahead of the lower wing. =Description= Wooden construction biplane, conventional in layout. Fuselage rectangular in cross-section, plywood-covered (engine section - metal covered). Rectangular two-spar wings, plywood- and canvas-covered. Crew of two, sitting in tandem in open cockpits, with individual windshields. Cockpits with twin controls, the instructor seated aft.

His father was Oranyan or Oranmiyan and his brother, according to the historian Samuel Johnson, was Shango. Life Ajaka lived in a fierce and tumultuous age, but he was originally a man of a peaceful disposition which was perceived as weakness. The reason for this is not far-fetched: it seems the emperor was resolved to busy himself with palace affairs while simultaneously allowing his warriors more freedom than was traditional. This led to him being deposed and his brother being proclaimed emperor after a series of insubordinations from his local chiefs. He was later called on to ascend the throne after the death of Sango. In his later years, he changed from being mild mannered to a warlike emperor, and was similar to his brother. The Basorun or prime minister and commander-in-chief during his second reign was Salekoudi, and it was in this period that the Yoruban drum, Ogidigbo, was introduced to Oyo. The drum was and still is used in great festivals where the Alaafin and the Basorun are present.

The game was released as a CD-ROM. Gameplay iM1A2 Abrams is a simulation focusing on battlefield management as a tank commander controlling an entire company of support vehicles including infantry, artillery, and air strikes as well as the players' own tank platoon(s). Mastering the many company commands, and regular use of the real-time updated tactical map is essential for success. The player also has the ability to \\"jump\\" to each crew position (commander, gunner, driver) in every M1A2 vehicle on the battlefield and take control of each directly. Three separate fictional campaigns are available to play: the Iranian (taking place in Iraq), Bosnian, and Ukrainian. All of the major eastern and western vehicle types were accurately modeled, and a fictional T-95 main battle tank was added to the mix to create more of a challenge for the somewhat superior M1A2 MBT. Development The game's head designer was Arnold Hendrick, best known for designing M1 Tank Platoon. To help with the game's authenticity, Hendrick consulted with a number of contacts in General Dynamics and the United States Armed Forces, including a master gunnery sergeant who was actively training Saudis in the use of the MIA2.  Reception  Publisher Interactive Magic shipped 100,000 copies of the game in preparation for its launch. Next Generation rated it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"At times, it feels more like a job than a game. The designers went for keeping it true to life, and that means authenticity, not adrenaline.\\" North American distributions of the game included the red black and white \\"PC Gamer Editor's Choice\\" sticker. This was one of Interactive Magic's last releases in a line of military simulations.

Powell was born in Texas. He and his younger brother Art Powell, an NFL wide receiver for the New York Titans and Oakland Raiders in the 1960s, grew up in the Logan Heights area of San Diego, California. Powell played professional baseball and football as well as boxed. His greatest success was as an NFL player and a boxer, even boxing against Muhammad Ali. High school Charlie starred in football, basketball, track and baseball at San Diego High School. In 1950, as a 6'-3\\", 230-pound defensive end and offensive end, with tremendous power and speed, he was named the California high school football player of the year. In track, he ran 100 yards in 9.6 seconds and threw the shot put 57 feet 9¬º inches. In basketball, he was a second-team all- league center. As a high school baseball player, he hit balls out of San Diego Balboa Stadium. He turned a down an offer of a tryout by the Harlem Globetrotters. Baseball career After high school, Charlie was recruited by Notre Dame and UCLA to play football, St. Louis Browns baseball owner Bill Veeck, who had acquired the legendary pitcher Satchel Paige from the Cleveland Indians, signed the power-hitting outfielder to a professional baseball contract. He was sent to the Stockton Ports, a Class B minor league team. Football career But after playing pro baseball in the summer of 1952, Charlie suddenly abandoned his pro baseball career and signed a pro football contract with the San Francisco 49ers. At 19, he became the youngest player in NFL history. In his first game, he started against the NFL champion Detroit Lions and had multiple sacks against QB Bobby Layne, totalling 67 yards in sack yardage.

Pevney was unhappy with the script and when Universal refused to make the changes he wanted, left the picture. Universal decided to promote Juran to director two weeks before filming commenced. The shoot time was twenty days. The sets were designed by the art directors Bernard Herzbrun and Alfred Sweeney. Juran says he was helped greatly by the cast, particularly Boris Karloff (\\"he put so much into the character that wasn't in the script\\"), and his assistant director, William Holland. Universal was impressed with Juran's work and offered him a one-year contract as director. Release Universal released The Black Castle as a \\"special pre-release show\\" on Halloween night on October 31, 1952 before placing them in general release from the first week of November.

The Hollywood Reporter found the film \\"stacks up as excellent program fare\\". Time commented that the film \\"tries hard to chill the moviegoer's spine. Most of the time, however, this boy-meets-ghoul melodrama is only tepid theatrics.\\" A statement Motion Picture Exhibitor echoed, stating \\"it is just a programmer, with the names not too potent for the marquee.\\" In a retrospective review, Fangoria commented in 1996 that Black Castle \\"features all the necessary equipage for this type of full-bodied Gothic\\", noting it had an \\"admirable atmosphere, an agreeably adventuresome flavor and some genuinely fine art direction and photography\\" before declaring it \\"The last of the old- fashioned Universal horror costumers, The Black Castle dishes up action and chills with ghoulish gusto\\".

The IOOF portion of the cemetery was to the east of the Masons' part.Historic names mark old gravestones. Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. Around 1915 another section owned by IOOF was added west of the Masons' section. On August 7, 1973, the city of Hillsboro received the deeds to the cemeteries and took over maintenance and operations. In 1995, 155 grave sites were vandalized, causing over $75,000 in damage. The city made improvements in 2012 with the addition of an arched, wrought-iron entry and information kiosk. Paid for in part by a state grant, the project cost $13,000 to complete. In 2014, the city completed a master plan to make $1.7 million in improvements, including sidewalks, parking, and fencing.

Ancient history In 480 BC, Xerxes, King of Persia, opened a canal for his fleet to pass through. He did this in order to avoid rounding the edge of Athos peninsula, where Mardonius saw his fleet being destroyed ten years earlier due to extreme weather conditions. This is the place where the first attempt of the Persians to conquer the Greek cities-states had failed. The canal needed several years to be built and hundreds of residents of the area (mainly Acanthians, since Acanthus, modern Ierissos, is situated only 5 km away, but also residents of Sani and Ouranoupolis) were used by Xerxes as slaves for the completion of the canal. It is commonly regarded as the site of the world's first offshore wind farm.

Etymology Nea Roda is named after the original village (now in the Turkish provenience of Erdek) called Roda. Rodi (Œ°œåŒ¥Œπ) meaning pomegranate, is the root of the word Roda which means \\"many pomegranates\\"; and \\"Nea\\" (ŒùŒ≠Œ±) meaning new is the meaning of the first word. This due to an abundance pomegranate trees in the original village. This can be seen even today in the new village, where many people still have pomegranate trees in their backyard. Today  Today, Nea Roda is a modern village with 1,164 residents (2011 census), making it the second biggest town of the municipal unit of Stagira-Akanthos after Ierissos.

The aqueduct is 662 metres long and lost its title of longest aqueduct to the Magdeburg Water Bridge which crosses the Elbe and is 918 metres long. The aqueduct was designed by the engineers L√©once-Abel Mazoyer and Charles Sigault. The masonry abutments and piers were completed between 1890 and 1896 by Gustave Eiffel and the steel channel was completed by Dayd√© & Pill√© of Creil. The aqueduct was inaugurated on 16 September 1896 with the crossing of the boat Aristide, belonging to Ernest Guingamp. It allowed the development of transport to the Freycinet gauge between the Loire and Seine, and is a registered historic monument in France.

These piers support a single steel beam in turn supporting a steel channel which contains more than 13,000 tonnes of water, 2.2 meters deep and 6 metres wide allowing boats with a 1.8m draught to cross. The width of the aqueduct, towpaths included, is 11.5 meters and its length is 662.7 meters. There is a line of standard lamps on each side of aqueduct.

His interactive work has been shown at museums, galleries and art festivals internationally. Many more recent works can be seen as urban scale objects and installations in public spaces. Hands, by Christian Moeller - Mineta San Jos√© International Airport, California. Stix in Nashville, Tennessee. Early life and education Growing up in Frankfurt, Moeller received his first professional education in a construction company where he trained as a draftsman in structural engineering. At age nineteen, he took a job opportunity in West Africa working for a railway construction project producing topographic and geological maps in Boou√©, a small village on the banks of the Ogoou√© river in central Gabon. Following his return to Germany in 1981, Moeller studied architecture at the College of Applied Sciences in Frankfurt and under Gustav Peichl at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. While working at the architecture firm G√ºnther Behnisch in Stuttgart, he began his transition into the arts, joining the Institute for New Media in the St√§delschule, Frankfurt under Peter Weibel in 1990. Work Moeller first gained widespread recognition working with electronic media technologies to produce innovative and intense physical events. His media installations ranged from handheld objects to architectural scale installations. Many of his works throughout the 1990s interrogated and explored the synergies between architecture, sound, technology, and moving images. A pioneer in this field, he created novel works like the media facade ‚ÄúKinetic Light Sculpture‚Äù in 1992 in collaboration with the architect R√ºdiger Kramm and the interactive dance piece ‚ÄúElectro Clips‚Äù with Stephen Galloway, the principal dancer at William Forsythe‚Äôs Ballet Frankfurt at the time.

It consists in the lengthening (gemination) of the initial consonant in certain contexts. The phenomenon is variously referred to in English as word-initial gemination, phonosyntactic consonantal gemination, as well as under the native Italian terms: raddoppiamento sintattico (RS), raddoppiamento fonosintattico (RF), raddoppiamento iniziale, rafforzamento iniziale (della consonante) Italian \\"Syntactic\\" means that gemination spans word boundaries, as opposed to word- internal geminate consonants as in \\"cat\\" or \\"year\\". In Standard Italian, syntactic doubling occurs after the following words (with exceptions described below): *all stressed (\\"strong\\") monosyllables (monosillabi forti) and many unstressed (\\"weak\\") monosyllables: a, blu, che, chi, d√†, do, e, √®, fa, fra, fu, gi√†, ha, ho, l√†, ma, me, n√©, o, pu√≤, qua, qui, re, sa, s√©, so, sto, su, tra, tre, tu, va **Example: Andiamo a casa , 'Let's go home' *all polysyllables stressed on the final vowel (that and the previous types are called oxytone words) **Example: Parigi √® una citt√† bellissima , 'Paris is a very beautiful city' *some paroxytone words (those whose stress is on the second-last syllable): come, dove, qualche, sopra (sovra) **Example: Come va? , 'How are you?' Articles, clitic pronouns (mi, ti, lo, etc.) and various particles do not cause doubling in Standard Italian. Phonetic results such as occasional ‚Üí 'the dog' in colloquial speech are transparent cases of synchronic assimilation. The cases of doubling are commonly classified as \\"stress-induced doubling\\" and \\"lexical\\".Doris Borrelli (2002) \\"Raddoppiamento Sintattico in Italian: A Synchronic and Diachronic Cross-Dialectical Study\\" (Outstanding Dissertations in Linguistics) Routledge, Lexical syntactic doubling has been explained as a diachronic development, initiating as straightforward synchronic assimilation of word-final consonants to the initial consonant of the following word, subsequently reinterpreted as gemination prompts after terminal consonants were lost in the evolution from Latin to Italian (ad > a, et > e, etc.). Thus resulting from assimilation of in Latin ad casam in casual speech persists today as a casa with , with no present-day clue of its origin or of why a casa has the geminate but la casa does not (illa, the source of la, had no final consonant to produce assimilation). Stress-induced word-initial gemination conforms to phonetic structure of Italian syllables: stressed vowels in Italian are phonetically long in open syllables, short in syllables closed by a consonant; final stressed vowels are by nature short in Italian, thus attract lengthening of a following consonant to close the syllable. In citt√† di mare 'seaside city', the short final vowel of citt√† thus produces . In some phonemic transcriptions, such as in the Zingarelli dictionary, words that trigger syntactic gemination are marked with an asterisk: e.g. the preposition \\"a\\" is transcribed as . =Regional occurrence= Syntactic gemination is the normal native pronunciation in Tuscany, Central Italy (both stress-induced and lexical) and Southern Italy (only lexical), including Sicily and Corsica. In Northern Italy speakers use it inconsistently because the feature is not present in the dialectal substratum and is not usually shown in the written language unless a single word is produced by the fusion of two constituent words: \\"chi sa\\"-> chiss√† ('who knows' in the sense of 'goodness knows'). It is not taught in normative grammar programmes in Italian schools, so many speakers are not consciously aware of its existence. Those northern speakers who do not acquire it naturally often do not try to adopt the feature. =Exceptions= It does not occur in the following cases: *a pause is at the boundary of words in question;Absalom, Matthew, Stevens, Mary, and Hajek, John, \\"A Typology of Spreading, Insertion and Deletion or What You Weren‚Äôt Told About Raddoppiamento Sintattico in Italian\\", in \\"Proc. 2002 Conference of the Australian Linguistic Society\\", Macquarie University (e-print pdf file) **In particular, initial gemination may be conditioned by syntax, which determines the likelihood of pause. For example, in the phrase La volpe ne aveva mangiato met√† prima di addormentarsi ('The fox had eaten half of it before falling asleep'), there is no gemination after met√† if there is even a slight pause, as prima is part of the adjunct, a sentence element that is easily isolated phonologically from the main clause within the prosodic hierarchy of the phrase.Nespor, Marina & Irene Vogel (1986). Prosodic Phonology. Dordrecht: Foris. *the stressed final vowel is lengthened; *a sharp break or change occurs in the pitch on the word boundary. There are other considerations, especially in various dialects, so that initial gemination is subject to complicated lexical, syntactic and phonological/prosodic conditions. Finnish In Finnish, the phenomenon is called rajageminaatio or rajakahdennus, alku- or loppukahdennus (boundary gemination, boundary lengthening). It is triggered by certain morphemes. If the morpheme boundary is followed by a consonant, then it is doubled, if by a vowel then a long glottal stop is introduced. For example, \\"mene pois\\" is pronounced \\"meneppois\\" and \\"mene ulos\\" . Following Fred Karlsson (who called the phenomenon \\"initial doubling\\"), these triggering morphemes are called x-morphemes and marked with the superscripted 'x', e.g., \\"sadex\\". Karlsson, Fred: Suomen kielen √§√§nne- ja muotorakenne. Porvoo: WSOY, 1982. . Maltese Maltese does not itself feature syntactic gemination, but it predominantly borrows Sicilian and Italian verbs with a geminated initial consonant, e.g. (i)kkomprenda, (i)pperfezzjona from Italian comprendere, perfezionare. Though reinforced by native verbal morphology (and hence also restricted to verbs), this phenomenon likely goes back originally to syntactic gemination in the source languages.

It stretches from Gardiner through New Paltz, Rosendale, and Ulster to the Kingston city line. The trail is separated from the Walden‚ÄìWallkill Rail Trail by two state prisons in Shawangunk, though there have been plans to bypass these facilities, and to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with other regional rail trails. The northern section of the trail forms part of the proposed Empire State Trail. Plans to create the rail trail began as early as 1983, when New Paltz considered uses for the then-defunct Wallkill Valley corridor; the railroad had ceased regular traffic in 1977, and by 1983 had begun to remove its tracks. In 1991, a local land trust purchased the section of the former rail corridor between New Paltz and Gardiner, and conveyed the New Paltz section to the town and village of New Paltz. The trail was formally opened between New Paltz and Gardiner in 1993, though Gardiner did not purchase its section from the trust until 2007. The length of the trail was effectively doubled by a county land seizure in 2009, extending the walkway north from Rosendale through Ulster to Kingston. The extension included the Rosendale trestle, a bridge across the Rondout Creek. There are several other bridges that carry the trail, though none are as long. The trail serves hikers, joggers, bikers, horseback riders, and cross-country skiers. It passes through several historic districts, such as Huguenot Street in New Paltz, and the Binnewater Historic District and Snyder Estate in Rosendale. The trail also traverses U.S. Route 44 (concurrent with State Route 55), and state routes 299 and 213. Several natural features are visible from clearing along the trail, such as the Shawangunk Ridge to the west, and the Plattekill Creek between New Paltz and Gardiner. The trail passes through dense vegetation, and is frequented by many types of animals and overwintering birds.  History  The original Wallkill Valley rail line, stretching from Montgomery to Kingston Stretching from Montgomery to Kingston, the Wallkill Valley Railroad operated from 1866 until its last regular freight run on December 31, 1977. During the 1980s, its owner, Conrail, began to salvage the former corridor's steel rails and sell off sections of the rail bed. State law mandated that in such sales, offers be made first to the state, then to the involved counties and municipalities. * * The state bought a portion of rail bed between Shawangunk and Gardiner in November 1985 for the construction of the Shawangunk Correctional Facility in the hamlet of Wallkill. While Montgomery and Shawangunk purchased their sections of the railroad ‚Äì , respectively ‚Äì in 1985, eventually creating the Walden‚ÄìWallkill Rail Trail, the towns of New Paltz, Gardiner and Rosendale initially declined to purchase their sections of the rail line. The town of Shawangunk has been evaluating plans to bypass the state prison to connect the Walden‚ÄìWallkill and Wallkill Valley trails since 2004, and such a connection was listed as a project in a 2008 county-wide transportation plan. The latest proposal involves diverting the trail along Birch Road. The Wallkill Valley Rail Trail was the seventeenth rail trail created in New York state, and became a National Recreation Trail in 2007. = New Paltz and Gardiner = A Quiet Place was filmed here. Converting the former corridor to a rail trail was first considered in a 1983 environmental report commissioned by the town of New Paltz. The study considered repurposing the corridor as a road for cars, but determined that the right-of-way, \\"lend[ing] itself to multiple and simultaneous 'people-oriented' transit\\", was \\"ideally suited for use as a trail for hiking, strolling, running, cycling and cross-country skiing\\". In 1988, New Paltz invited a local non-profit, the Wallkill Valley Land Trust, to acquire the portion of the rail line between New Paltz and Gardiner. The Wallkill Valley Land Trust in turn requested assistance from The Trust for Public Land, and the purchase was completed on January 18, 1991. While the town and village of New Paltz immediately purchased their sections from the Wallkill Valley Land Trust ‚Äì roughly , respectively ‚Äì Gardiner did not purchase its section until much later. Portions of the New Paltz‚ÄìGardiner section were informally open since June 1991, but the formal opening ceremony of the full trail between New Paltz and Gardiner took place on October 9, 1993. A footbridge connecting the parking area of the Sojourner Truth park with the trail The Gardiner section was in such a state of disrepair in 2004 that the Wallkill Valley Land Trust almost closed it. Gardiner received a $100,000 grant from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation in December 2006, and the purchase was completed in 2007. The state provided an additional $5,000 to maintain the trail. Purchasing the section allowed Gardiner to fix the drainage problems that had deteriorated the surface of the trail, and to ban the use of motor vehicles, something the Wallkill Valley Land Trust had not done. Though the section was worth $307,300, the Wallkill Valley Land Trust sold it to Gardiner for $70,000. In 2009 and 2010, the Tea Party movement held protests along the Gardiner section of the trail. * * In November 2009, New Paltz received grants from the Greenway Conservancy, a state organization, to fund several rail trail‚Äìrelated projects. This included $17,750 to create a link between the New Paltz section of the trail and the Hudson Valley Rail Trail in nearby Lloyd, which was in turn being extended eastward to the Poughkeepsie Bridge; the connection with the bridge was completed in October 2010. The Wallkill Valley Railroad had considered such a connection after the bridge opened in 1889, but never built one. The grants also included $7,000 to create of ADA-accessible trail, to connect the parking area of a local park, named after Sojourner Truth, with the rail trail. The town had intended to connect the parking area with the trail since the late 1990s, but concerns over traffic, as well as state requirements, had added to the time and cost of the path; it was completed by June 2010. The connections are part of a county- wide plan to create a bicycle path along NY 299, to link regional rail trails. = Rosendale = The northern half of the Rosendale trestle in 2008, without decking or guard rails The Rosendale portion of the rail bed runs from Rosendale through Ulster to Kingston and contains the Rosendale trestle. The trestle rises above the Rondout Creek and State Route 213, and also spans the former Delaware and Hudson Canal. At the time of its construction it was the highest span bridge in the United States. Conrail sold the Rosendale section, including the bridge, in 1986 to a private businessman, John E. Rahl, for one dollar. Rahl maintained that the purchase granted him the right to \\"restore rail service on the whole Wallkill line\\", and to joint ownership of Conrail. Between 1989 and 1991, Rahl installed planking and guard rails on the southern half of the bridge, which was then opened to the public. He intended to allow bungee jumping off the bridge, and did so until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws. Douglas Hase, an entrepreneur who had run both bungee jumping and hot air ballooning companies, * * tried unsuccessfully in 2003 and 2004 to get a variance for such a venture. View of the Rondout Creek and State Route 213 from the Rosendale trestle After Rahl failed to pay $13,716 in property taxes over a period of three years, Ulster County foreclosed on the property on April 15, 2009. The Wallkill Valley Land Trust and Open Space Institute placed a bid on the land parcels comprising the Rosendale section on April 22, 2009, and agreed to pay all outstanding taxes before receiving full ownership on July 8, 2009, with the intention of adding it to the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. Following an engineering survey, the bridge was closed to the public in June 2009 for repairs. Renovations were completed in 2013, allowing for the bridge to be opened to the public. Canopy Development, a green development company from Northampton, Massachusetts, owns a portion of the former rail bed in Rosendale. It has agreed to establish a right-of-way, rerouting the trail to allow public access. Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool, which will be bypassed. The Mohonk Preserve and Open Space Conservancy were given a $20,000 state grant in March 2011 to maintain the portion of the trail by Kingston. By the end of summer 2013, the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale-Kingston extension was opened to the public, completing the entire 23.7 mile rail trail. A regional business association has proposed a link between the trail, in Rosendale, and a series of regional rail trails. The proposal would create a network of rail trails across the towns of Marbletown, Rochester, and Wawarsing. Several involved towns have been working toward accomplishing such a connection.  Route  An overpass carrying the trail over Forest Glen Road in Gardiner The trail begins at Denniston Road, in the southern part of the town of Gardiner. Movement farther south is impossible, because the corridor south of Denniston Road is fenced off by barbed wire. After roughly , it crosses Sand Hill Road before approaching the hamlet of Gardiner at the mark. Once in the hamlet, the trail intersects U.S. Route 44 (concurrent with State Route 55). Located within the hamlet are a defunct, former dairy creamery and the site of the former Gardiner railroad station. Built in 1881 and opened the following year, the creamery was one of the dairies that transported its products to New York City by way of the Wallkill Valley Railroad. It was originally the property of the Borden family, but closed in the 1920s, and has since been renovated as an apartment complex. The former Gardiner railroad station ceased operations when the rail line closed. It became a sporting goods store by 1981, a video store by the early 1990s, and an antique store by 1995. The station burned down on October 10, 2002. The trail crosses Phillies Bridge Road north of the hamlet, with an overpass carrying the trail over Forest Glen Road farther. The road overlies the Catskill Aqueduct and Delaware Aqueduct. Originally supported by trestles and a stone foundation, the overpass was rebuilt in 1910 during the construction of the Catskill Aqueduct. The reconstruction removed the trestles and added a concrete foundation. Though a local legend holds that the bridge was originally built in response to the death of a prominent woman at the Forest Glen railroad crossing, it is more likely that it was built to maintain the rail line at a consistent grade. A little over from the bridge is the site of the former Forest Glen station. The trail crosses Bridge Creek Road and Old Ford Road about from the Forest Glen bridge, respectively, before entering the town of New Paltz. View of the Plattekill Creek and Shawangunk Ridge from the Plattekill Creek bridge Shortly after entering New Paltz, the trail crosses a bridge over Plattekill Creek. The masonry for the bridge was completed by late June 1870, and trestle work was done by July. Originally made of wood, the bridge was accidentally set on fire in 1880 by ashes or sparks from a passing train. This prompted the railroad to coat its rail ties with tin while replacing its wooden bridges with ones made of stone. The bridge's original abutments were made of Shawangunk conglomerate. It was rebuilt in 1912, and crosses the Plattekill Creek at a height of .A placard affixed to the Plattekill Creek bridge by the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail Association. The Shawangunk Ridge is visible from the bridge. Plains Road is shortly after the bridge, and the trail continues for before crossing Cedar Lane. It crosses Plains Road again after another , reaching the Sojourner Truth park in the village of New Paltz. The trail is connected to the park via a small footbridge constructed in 2010 by the Alexandria, Minnesota‚Äìbased construction company Contech. It has a weight limit of A placard affixed to the bridge. and is able to withstand earthquakes. At the edge of the park, the trail crosses Water Street and enters the Water Street Market, a \\"restored area of boutiques, galleries, and caf√©s\\". It then crosses State Route 299 and passes La Stazione, the former railroad station. The refurbished depot had been originally built in 1870, rebuilt after a 1907 fire, and sold to private interests in 1959. The building was in a state of disrepair by the early 1980s, but renovated in 1988 and converted to an Italian restaurant in 1999. Over the next , the trail passes North Front Street, Broadhead Avenue, and Mulberry Street. After another the trail traverses Huguenot Street, a historic district containing colonial-era stone houses. Some of the houses date to the late 1600s. View of the Wallkill River from the Springtown bridge About from Huguenot Street, the trail reaches the Springtown bridge spanning the Wallkill River. The bridge was originally made of wood and completed by the middle of December 1870, but was rebuilt between 1880 and 1881, using iron, by Clarke, Reeves & Co. It was rated by the superintendent of the Wallkill Valley Railroad to be safe for rail traffic as fast as . The bridge's decking and benches were put in place in 1993 by volunteers and members of the nearby Hutterite community in the hamlet of Rifton. The design of the bridge's railings was influenced by equestrians to better accommodate horses. Immediately after the bridge is Springtown Road. The trail continues west of the Wallkill River. Roughly from the Springtown bridge, the trail crosses Cragswood Road. Another farther, it reaches the New Paltz‚ÄìRosendale boundary line, continuing another on formerly private property to Mountain Road in the hamlet of Rosendale. Restorations to the Rosendale trestle were completed, and the bridge was opened to the public in June, 2013. This added over the Rondout Creek to Kingston, crossing Interstate 87 and terminating by State Route 32. The extension passes through the town of Ulster and includes four small bridges between Rosendale and Kingston.  Recreation  The road between the former railroad station and Water Street Market was the first site of a new town crosswalk system that opened on March 29, 2008. Under the new system, pedestrians can use flags placed in roadside containers to signal traffic. The trail connects with the Sojourner Truth park, which has had access to the Wallkill River for kayaking and canoeing since April 27, 2003. The Minnewaska Preserve and Mohonk Preserve, featuring of combined walkways, can be reached through New Paltz. An 1875 map showing the Wallkill rail line passing through Rosendale's cement district The trail connects to the Binnewater Historic District in Rosendale. The district was the location of several local quarries which opened throughout the region after the 1825 discovery of rocks capable of producing Rosendale cement in the nearby hamlet of High Falls. At its peak, the district was producing 4,000,000 barrels a year and employed 5,000 people. Though the Binnewater rail station was once part of the historic district, it was located too close to Binnewater Road and was hit repeatedly by trucks until it fell apart in May 1989. The station was subsequently demolished by the county highway department. Another historic district, the Snyder Estate, runs along the Rosendale section. The Snyder Estate is a former mining site once used by all four major regional cement producers. The Rosendale trestle has been the site of numerous picnics, barbecues, and at least one wedding. One person has tried bungee jumping off the bridge without a restraining cord. Several shale outcrops are visible along the trail, with views of the Shawangunk Ridge to the west; the skytop tower of the Mohonk Mountain House is visible on one of the cliffs. Parking for the trail is provided at a municipal lot on Farmers Turnpike in Gardiner. In New Paltz, there are parking lots at the Sojourner Truth park, off Springtown Road, at the Huguenot Historical Society, and at a Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) conference center. The trail runs parallel to state routes 208 and 32; there are two park and rides on Route 32, a 63-spot lot in New Paltz, and a 58-spot lot in Rosendale. There are two bicycle shops along the trail in both Gardiner and New Paltz.  Flora and fauna  siding at the Sojourner Truth park in the village of New Paltz Flora along the northern end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). Many animals pass through the trail unobserved, leaving behind tracks. This includes bears, deer, coyotes, dogs, bobcats, cats, skunks and rabbits. Several bird species overwinter in the region and can be observed from the trail, such as the mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), bluebird (Sialia), cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), starling (Sturnus vulgaris), downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), American goldfinch (Spinus tristis), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), sparrow (Passer) and purple finch (Carpodacus purpureus).

He is best known for linking the smog in Southern California to automobiles and is therefore known by many as the \\"father\\" of air pollution control. After serving as an original board member of the Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board, formed in 1960 to combat the smog, Dr. Haagen-Smit became the California Air Resources Board's first chairman in 1968. Shortly before his death, of lung cancer, the Air Resources Board's El Monte Laboratory was named after him.  Education  Haagen-Smit was born December 22, 1900 in the Dutch city of Utrecht. His father worked as a chemist at the Dutch mint. Haagen-Smit attended the Rijks Hogere Burgerschool in Utrecht. He graduated from the University of Utrecht in 1922 with a major in organic chemistry and a minor in mathematics. He earned his M.A. degree in 1926 and Ph.D. in 1929. His work was on terpenes, a hydrocarbon found in plants. His dissertation is titled \\"Investigations in the Field of Sesquiterpenes\\".  Academic career  He stayed at the University of Utrecht from 1929 to 1935 as chief assistant. He became an expert in plant derived chemicals, particularly Auxins, a hormone. He was invited to lecture at Harvard University in 1936 by Kenneth Thimann. He was appointed as associate professor by California Institute of Technology in 1937 by Thomas Hunt Morgan, and professor in 1940, becoming one of the \\"Dutch Mafia\\" at Caltech. (Another member of the \\"mafia\\" was Frits Warmolt Went.) Haagen-Smit studied the flavor of pineapples. He published a paper jointly with two other scientists on traumatic acid, a wound healing hormone, in Science in 1939. He was the director of the Plant Environmental Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology from 1965 to 1971.  Air pollution fighter  He started his air pollution research in 1948, when Southern California residents suffered stinging eyes and respiratory irritation from smog.Pitts NJ Jr., Stephens ER. \\"Arie Jan Haagen-Smit, 1900-1977\\" J Air Poll Control Assn 1978: 516-517. His original interest stemmed from damage to crop plants smog was causing in the Los Angeles Basin, and he had received many requests from government agencies to investigate air pollution.Haagen-Smit, A. J., Rept. to the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District, \\"The Analysis of Air Contaminants,\\" 1949. Using techniques originally developed in his work on the biosynthesis of essential oils, Haagen-Smit showed that smog primarily resulted from a photochemical reaction of the unburned hydrocarbons, ozone, and nitrogen oxides from automobile exhaust and industrial fuel combustion.A. J. Haagen- Smit. World of Chemistry, Gale, 2006. Biography in Context. Accessed 7 Mar. 2017.Haagen-Smit, A.J. 1952. Chemistry and physiology of Los Angeles smog. Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research 44:1342-1346. After a representative of the Stanford Research Institute (which was funded by the oil industry) went to Caltech and attempted to discredit Haagen-Smit's findings, Haagen-Smit increased his research efforts. By the mid 1950s, the connection between automobiles and smog in Los Angeles became widely accepted in scientific circles. Haagen-Smit worked with Arnold Beckman, who developed various equipment for monitoring smog. Haagen-Smit's research led the automobile industry to install positive crankcase ventilation, the first vehicle emissions control system, in 1961.

She swept mines in support of the invasion of Iwo Jima 17 February 1945, destroying two enemy machine gun emplacements ashore as the invasion began. YMS-362 witnessed the mushroom cloud resulting from the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and was present in Tokyo Bay at the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on 2 September 1945. Her minesweeping patrols continued around the Japanese home islands until 28 December, when YMS-362 began passage for her return to Charleston, South Carolina, arriving in late May 1946. After overhaul and refitting, she took up duties with the Atlantic Fleet as a unit attached to the U.S. Naval Mine-craft Base at Charleston, South Carolina.

These efforts aim to change the perceptions of people in the South Texas area who associate the lake with uncleanliness. The lake is beloved by birdwatchers who enjoy the sights of many species of bird that live on or around the lake. In 2004, the National Audubon Society entered into a lease with San Antonio Water System to manage the 1,200 acre site. History The lake was first utilized by the Spanish in the early 18th century to supply the large abundance of cattle with water. They called it the \\"Lake of the Ducks\\" because of the bounty of ducks that dwelled near the waters. The Mitchell family of San Antonio owned the lake in the 19th century and used it for fowl hunting. The city purchased the lake in 1901 for waste management and as early as the 1970s, efforts began to protect the lake and its rare birds.

He was a past president of the National Weather Association. \\"Doc Moore\\" was also the co-author, with fellow meteorologist Peter R. Chaston, of Jokes and Puns for Groan-Ups. Growing up in New York City, Jim had an early interest in weather. He attended New York University, graduating with a B.S. in meteorology, magna cum laude, in 1974. He moved on to Cornell University, where he earned a M.S. in 1976 with the thesis A Dynamic Visualization of the Events in the Multiscale Energy-momentum Cascade Leading to the Development of Severe Storms, continuing to a Ph.D. in 1979 with the dissertation A Utilization of the Nested Grid Approach in the Development of a Severe Weather Index, both in atmospheric sciences. He took an assistant professor position at State University College at Oneonta (SUCO), New York, from 1978-1980. After this he was a longtime professor at Saint Louis University, where he remained a staple from 1980 until his death in 2006. A noted synoptician, most of his doctoral students are current or former professors of synoptic meteorology. Moore was strongly interested in teaching, both forecasters and university students, as well as the general public. He regarded furthering his students (and forecasters) as the most important thing he could be doing --as even more important than his research. As such, he was heavily involved in bridging research and operational meteorology and he traveled the country giving presentations, interacting with forecasters and ingesting feedback. He served as president of National Weather Association (NWA) in 1999, and in 2000, received the T. Theodore Fujita Research Achievement Award from the NWA. In 2003, he was elected a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS). Then in 2006 he received the inaugural COMET Lifetime Achievement Award, and posthumously, the NWA Lifetime Achievement Award.

The venue's main auditorium seats 150 people and is used for both professional touring shows and for local community groups. History In 1967, Philip Tilstone, the first lecturer in drama at the University of Wolverhampton which was then the Wolverhampton College of Technology, wanted to establish the subject not just at the university but in Wolverhampton too. He was committed to provide a range of performance events for both students and the local community. Alongside his colleague, the late Dr. Percy Young, the director of music at the college, Tilstone gave the music students the opportunity to perform and these performance events would justify the provision of a fully equipped theatre/workshop venue, the Arena Theatre, with shared access for students and visiting performers. In 1989, Kevin O'Sullivan became the administrator for the Arena Theatre and then the theatre manager until his retirement in 2013. Student work was frequently performed at the Arena Theatre and local audiences continued to benefit from the range and quality of its professional programming. The Arena Theatre continued to act as an essential resource for drama and a first class performance venue for the region. Students from surrounding colleges and schools, members of local drama groups and arts organisations all made extensive use of the theatre. As well as the success of the venue in the local community, the Arena Theatre became a hotspot for touring theatre. Numerous prestigious companies touring shows to the Arena during this period included Kneehigh Theatre, Royal National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company, People Show, Tara Arts, Shared Experience, Forced Entertainment, Volcano, Hull Truck Theatre, Gay Sweatshop, Cheek by Jowl, Market Theatre (Johannesburg), Trestle Theatre, Complicite, Kathakali Dance, Black Theatre Co-operative, Red Shift Theatre, ATC Theatre, Snarling Beasties and The Right Size. In addition to these, the Arena Theatre welcomed local professional touring companies from the West Midlands, Foursight Theatre, Theatre Foundry and Pentabus. As well as these, there were dance performances, live art and music concerts. After 20 years, the theatre had outgrown its cramped and inaccessible home, so with investment from the University of Wolverhampton and a grant from the National Lottery, an ambitious ¬£2 million refurbishment began. Architects Marsh and Grochoski made use of the space available and the old gym was transformed into the Tilstone Studio. Current status After 18 months of building work, the Arena Theatre re-opened in October 1999. With greatly improved facilities and access, the theatre was able to expand its programme of performances and the Arena Theatre now host in excess of 200 public performances per year ‚Äì in addition to a host of other special events.

This was achieved by the amalgamation of the Furness Line of steamers with the business of Edward Withy and Co., iron and steel shipbuilders and repairers, of West Hartlepool, which was founded by Edward Withy (1844-1927), Henry Withy's brother. An early acquisition in 1900 was a controlling interest in Richardsons Westgarth & Company, a marine engineering business. Furness, Withy started with 18 vessels and over the subsequent years it owned in excess of a thousand ships.Furness Withy (Chartering) Limited status: usurped It bought the Prince line in 1916. In 1917 the Furness Shipbuilding Co Ltd was established, at Haverton Hill, River Tees, initially for war production. The Furness family sold its interests in the Company to a consortium led by Frederick Lewis, a Director in the business, in 1919. Also in 1919, Furness, Withy bought from Canada Steamship Lines the Quebec Steam Ship Company, which ran scheduled services between New York and Bermuda. Furness, Withy renamed its acquisition the Furness Bermuda Line. In 1928 Furness, Withy acquired the Red Cross Line.

In 1966 Furness, Withy terminated its Furness Bermuda Line operation. In 1968 Furness, Withy bought the Houlder Group, a company with offshore oil interests. Furness Withy bought Manchester Liners in 1970. The company was acquired by the Orient Overseas Container Line of Hong Kong in 1980. In 1990 it was resold to its present owner, the Oetker Group. Ships and services Furness, Withy operated both tramp and liner services. The latter included transatlantic Royal Mail and passenger routes, initially from West Hartlepool to Boston and New York, and later from Liverpool to St John's, Newfoundland, Halifax, Nova Scotia and Boston. The Liverpool ‚Äî Boston route was worked by a pair of sister ships, RMS Newfoundland and RMS Nova Scotia. The first Newfoundland and were built in 1925 and 1926 but were requisitioned in 1940 and 1941. Both were lost to enemy action: Nova Scotia as a troop ship in 1942; Newfoundland as a hospital ship in 1943.

History Probably designed by H W Keef, it was built in 1889 by Sir Bernard Hall, a West Indies merchant, Alderman and former Mayor of Liverpool. His daughter Florence died while in Paris at the age of 22 and he built this boys' club as a memorial and tribute to her at his sole expense. The building itself was a fine example of late Victorian architecture with delicate use of terracotta, and originally it had splendid interiors, from the great hall to the top lit gym to the library. The Florence Institute was officially opened as a boys club in 1890, four years after the opening of a similar establishment, the Gordon Working Lads Institute in Kirkdale on the other side of the city. However it was the first building in Britain to be specifically constructed as a boys' youth club. As a magistrate Bernard Hall knew all too well the product of poverty and lack of recreation for youth in the area, and as stated by the plaque on the building, he created what he hoped would be 'an acceptable place of recreation and instruction for the poor and working boys of this district of the City'. For a hundred years the 'Florrie' served the working and unemployed youth of the tough dock-side area. Weekend camps were held at Heswall on the Wirral Peninsula, reached by 6d ferry and bus return ticket. Summer camps were held in the Lake District away from the smoke, grime and pestilence of the inner city. A variety of sports and outdoor pursuits were provided for the community, including football, boxing and baseball to name a few. Gymnastics also was a part of the activities available for the local community. On the weekends dances were provided. Towards the end of the 1980s, at the depths of the economic slump for Liverpool the funding dried up for the Institute and in 1987 it was sold and its management, The Florence Institute Incorporated Company, was dissolved in 1988 with the intention that the charitable work should be continued by another body. Unfortunately this never happened and through the Bona Vacantia principle title to the building eventually fell to the Duchy of Lancaster, which is the private property portfolio of the British monarch. The building fell into disrepair and suffered from vandalism and the natural elements. This was compounded when in 1999 there was a major fire which destroyed the roof. Campaigning and regeneration The Florence Institute in its derelict state in May 2008, prior to the restoration As time went on the local community formed a pressure group, 'The Friends of the Florrie' to work with all the agencies and stakeholders to restore the splendour of the Florrie and provide a multi-ethnic community centre for all ages and abilities. In 2004 the plight of the Florrie was featured as a part of the 'Stop the Rot' campaign run by the largest circulation newspaper in Liverpool, the Liverpool Echo, this raised the profile of the derelict state of the building widely. The Florence Institute Trust Ltd is a community-led trust set up at the end of 2004 and chaired by the Bishop of Liverpool, Rev. James Jones. The trust applied for and received charitable status and also completed a community consultation on the future of the Florrie and successfully applied for a preliminary grant to create a regeneration plan and produce bids for more substantial funding for the repair and restoration of the building. The restored Florrie emerges In September 2006 campaigners applied for the Grade II listed status of the building to be upgraded to Grade II* which would signify that the building is of exceptional historical interest. Also that month the Heritage Lottery Fund agreed to a ¬£3.9 million pound grant to help regenerate the institute. The plan is for the building to house a 300-seater auditorium, gym, caf√©, cr√®che, social enterprises, library and heritage resource centre, and for the observatory to be restored. On a visit to Liverpool at the end of April 2007, Prince Charles who has been a noted proponent of urban regeneration was amazed to discover that the institute belonged to his mother, the Queen when he enquired as to its ownership. The Prince's Regeneration Trust is now going to be in contact with the Florrie campaigners and the Prince promised to help however he could. In January 2010 the Liverpool Echo reported that the Heritage Lottery Fund had confirmed funding of 3.7 million pounds towards the projected restoration costs of 6.6 million pounds. The doorway of the restored Florence Institute in December 2014 An application was also made to the Northwest Regional Development Agency for ¬£1.7m from the European Regional Development Fund Colin Taylor, of the Florence Institute Trust stated \\"We‚Äôre currently shortlisting for contractors who have experience of the restoration of heritage and community buildings and who want to work with the trust to ensure the local community are involved in the construction phase of the project. We estimate it will take 15 months.\\" Local residents of the Dingle reacted angrily to the news that out of town contractors were used to rebuild the building after the trust promised residents that local contractors would be used. Many locals are also infuriated that many of the facilities for the youth of the local area have been scrapped as well as the high prices for use of the function rooms. Much of the funding that the trust were awarded may not have been awarded had they known that the local people would be \\"priced out\\" of using the facilities. In January 2012, the restored building finally re- emerges from the scaffolding and boarding that has hidden the work since it started. Reopening The Prince of Wales officially re-opened the institute building when he visited Liverpool on Monday, 21 January 2013 Awards The newly renovated Florence Institute has been shortlisted for two prestigious awards in 2013. The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Award, and also the 2013 Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Building Conservation Award. The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) regional awards will be presented on 12 June 2013. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) awards for the North West will be announced on 9 May 2013.

Alf is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì in the Cochem-Zell district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Zell, whose seat is in the municipality of Zell an der Mosel.  Geography  = Location = At Alf, the Alf, or Alfbach, empties into the Moselle. The municipality lies on the Moselle's left bank. The municipal area measures 6.33 km¬≤, of which 0.67 km¬≤ is vineyards and 3.79 km¬≤ is wooded. = Neighbouring municipalities = Two neighbours are Bullay and P√ºnderich, both on the right bank. = Constituent communities = Alf's Ortsteile are the main centre, also called Alf, and the outlying centres of H√∂llenthal and Alf-Fabrik. The latter is historically an industrial centre, as its name suggests (Fabrik means ‚Äúfactory‚Äù in German). Both these centres lie on the river Alf, inland from the Moselle.  History  In pre-Roman times, the place was inhabited by Celts. In 50 BC, Alf had its first documentary mention under the Latin name Albis. The modern name is derived from this. At this time, it was a Roman settlement. In the Middle Ages, Alf belonged to the lordship whose seat was at the nearby Castle Arras, and which was in turn an Electoral-Trier fief. According to legend, a charcoal maker named Arras was enfeoffed with the holding by the Archbishop of Trier as thanks for his, and his twelve brave sons‚Äô, deed of having beaten back a great horde of Hungarians in the Alfbach valley. What is known to history, though, is that Count Palatine Herrmann, on the spot that had quite possibly been fortified as far back as Celtic times, had the castle built in 938 as a defensive facility against Hungarian incursions. In the many centuries that followed, the castle fell into disrepair, but it was rebuilt between 1907 and 1910. Since then, the castle has been inhabited, but is nonetheless open to visitors, affording them views of the Alfbach valley, the Moselle, the Kondelwald and the Hunsr√ºck. Beginning in 1794, Alf lay under French rule. In 1815 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland- Palatinate. Under the Verwaltungsvereinfachungsgesetz (‚ÄúAdministration Simplification Law‚Äù) of 18 July 1970, with effect from 7 November 1970, the municipality was grouped into the Verbandsgemeinde of Zell.  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Also nearby stands another castle, the Marienburg in the neighbouring municipality of Zell. The village's landmark is the belltower at the parish church built in 1734 and later remodelled in Gothic Revival style. There is also a well known statue, Christus in der Rast, from the 15th century.

It is an area of salt marsh and muds, with brackish water. It includes the only salt marsh, and the only bird sanctuary, in south Dublin Bay. It lies just outside the boundary of Dublin city, and just north of Booterstown DART station and its car park. The marsh belongs to the residual Pembroke Estate, and An Taisce administer it, having acquired a lease in 1970-1971 and having designated it a bird sanctuary. It is part of both a proposed Natural Heritage Area (NHA) and a proposed Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and of the South Dublin Bay and River Tolka Estuary Special Protection Area (SPA).National Parks and Wildlife Service, Ireland, South Dublin Bay and River Tolka Estuary Special Protection Area synopsis, retrieved 21 November 2012 Geography The marsh covers an area of approximately 4.3 ha. It is fed with fresh water from the Nutley Stream.Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, nd, \\"Booterstown Marsh and Beach\\", 40pp + ii: p. 6 This is occasionally supplemented from the Trimleston (or St. Helen's) Stream, which runs in a raised box culvert at the city end of the marsh.Doyle (2012), p. 38Sweeney (1991), p. 63 At the southern end the Nutley leaves the marsh and passes under the entrance to Booterstown DART station, reemerging into a channel, Williamstown Lagoon or Creek, which runs south for some distance and then flows east to the sea under the railway embankment.Sweeney (1991), p. 62 Some salt water flow reaches the marsh from this channel at each rising of the tide (the amount of salt water flow is limited by the passage at the railway station). The marsh contains two low- lying mud islands, made to provide secure resting and roosting areas for birds. These were formed in 2006. History of the marsh =Origins= The new railway line and causeway looking northwards from Blackrock. (1834) Area to the left became Blackrock Park and the marsh formed further north Originally the area now occupied by Booterstown Marsh was open to Merrion Strand and was part of a fringe marsh from Dublin city to Blackrock. Over time, much of this marshland was lost due to reclamation. The current marsh resulted from the building of the Dublin and Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire) railway line, which was one of the first in the world, from 1834-35. The line was built on an embankment, protected by a granite seawall. In the 1830s, the resulting tidal lagoon covered more than 28 ha. In the following decades much of the area was filled inBirdWatchIreland, South Dublin branch, birdwatching sites - Booterstown Marsh page, retrieved 21 November 2012 (part of it now forming Blackrock Park), leaving only Booterstown marsh still subject to flooding by seawater at high tide. =Agricultural use= By 1876 this reclaimed land was in agricultural use, made possible by the use of water control systems. A large gate valve was installed at the Williamstown outlet to the sea, which was lowered on the flow tide and raised on the ebb tide. The Williamstown lagoon acted as a sump, collecting the water draining from the agricultural land. Some landfill soil raised the level of the marsh and it was irrigated with fresh water from local streams. During both World Wars the marsh was used as allotments, however with increasing prosperity these fell idle and in the 1950s the area was used as pasture. The water control systems were also neglected, allowing salt water to flow back into the system. The marsh at low tide, from the southeastern boundary looking northwest. Right - the railway line; Left - the Rock Road (2007) By the 1970s the marsh showed salty vegetation at the railway side and fresh-water at the inner edges. This mixed habitat became an important site for many marsh bird and plant species. In 1970 the lease on the land was acquired by An Taisce, a conservation society, which has managed it as a nature reserve. =1980s to present= Oil spills in 1982 and, more severely in 1985, led to de-oxygenation of the marsh. The vegetation came to be dominated by Bolboschoenus maritimus, a rush that could withstand the salty conditions, though the re-discovery of a rare species of grass following some works on the drainage enhanced the conservation status of the marsh. In response the flap valves were removed, allowing a free flow of salt water that is rich in oxygen. Aside from the formation of the two mud islands for birds in 2006, no major work has been performed on the marsh in recent years, although a viewing area was made on a small pocket of land just to the north. Access and viewing The marsh is immediately adjacent to the Rock Road, the main coastal route from Dublin city to Blackrock, D√∫n Laoghaire and Dalkey, and close to the N11. There is paid parking at the DART station. Some Dublin Bus routes pass along the road also. It can be viewed from all sides, although viewing from the DART platform requires a train ticket, and there is a small viewing area with seating at the northwestern corner, opposite the end of Trimleston Avenue.Dun Laoghaire- Rathdown County Council, nd, \\"Booterstown Marsh and Beach\\", 40pp + ii: p. 7 An overhead view can be obtained from the footbridge across the railway line. Flora and fauna There are three main habitats ranging from near-freshwater in the north-western corner to near-saltwater by the DART station, with a graduation between. In recent years, the condition of the mud and water have improved, and birds have returned in large numbers. The scirpus growth has significantly reduced, and the many other species of plant occurring in the marsh have recovered. One of these, Puccinellia fasiculata, commonly \\"Borrer's saltmarsh grass,\\" is protected, along with its habitat. Other flora include salt-tolerant species such as sea milkwort, false fox sedge, and sea spurrey. The marsh area attracts moorhen, common teal, reed bunting, coot, mallard, sedge warbler, common snipe, little egret, northern lapwing, Eurasian oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwit, common redshank, dunlin, knot and brent goose. Additional species breeding in the marsh or visiting from nearby breeding locations include blackbird, dunnock and wren. Rarer visitors but sometimes sighted are grey heron, spotted redshank, ruff and little stint, Eurasian sparrowhawk and pied avocet. A short-billed dowitcher was present at the site from 2004-2005. Along the Nutley Stream kingfisher appear, and greenshank and water rail are seen in the south eastern corner. From the shore, common gull, herring gull and black-headed gull visit. Management The marsh is today managed by An Taisce, represented by the D√∫n Laoghaire local association and one of the national committees, working with scientists, Birdwatch Ireland and representatives of other users. A support group, Friends of Booterstown, also assists. Due to the presence of a rare plant, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has an oversight role with regard to major works on the marsh, or planning requests.

He pitched in Major League Baseball, Nippon Professional Baseball, and KBO League baseball. In the KBO, Lim ranks in the top ten in career victories and strikeouts, and in the top three in career saves. Career Lim is a 5 ft 11 in, 175 lb right-handed sidearm pitcher. He could throw a four-seam fastball, though the pitch usually sat at 93‚Äì95 mph (150‚Äì153 km/h). His signature pitch was his two-seam fastball which, due to its unique tailing movement earned the nickname \\"Serpent fastball ()\\". His other pitches included a high 70s slider with a sharp horizontal break, a mid 80s forkball, and a rarely used slow-curveball. He was one of the few pitchers who could pitch in multiple pitching forms. Lim pitched primarily sidearm and underhand, but could pitch from the three-quarters motion at will. = KBO (1995‚Äì2007) = Haitai Tigers Lim made his pro debut in 1995 with the Haitai Tigers in Korea Baseball Organization, and was regularly picked for the South Korean baseball team as a relief pitcher since the 1998 Asian Games, and won the bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics and two Asian Game gold medals in 1998 and 2002. Samsung Lions Though predominantly known as a closer, Lim was converted to a starting pitcher in 2001, and spent three years as the Samsung Lions' starter before returning to the bullpen in 2004. There was interest from Major League squads, but Lim decided to stay in South Korea. = NPB (2008‚Äì2012) = Tokyo Yakult Swallows In late 2007, Lim was signed by Japan's Tokyo Yakult Swallows in the hopes of bolstering their weak bullpen. In the 2008 NPB season, he recorded 33 saves (5th in the NPB league) with a 3.00 ERA in 51 innings pitched. In the 2009 NPB season, he recorded a 0.00 ERA for a few months, earning his nickname \\"Mr.Zero\\", and was also featured in the 2009 NPB All-star Game as a closer for the Central League team. He was sent down to the reserve squad after his ERA rose to 1.84 in a short stint, but he was brought back to strengthen Yakult's weak bullpen, which was responsible for its recent losses. Lim had his second Tommy John surgery in July 2012. = MLB (2013) = Chicago Cubs After the 2012 season, Lim agreed to a contract with the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball. The Cubs promoted Lim to the major leagues on September 4, 2013. After the season, Lim was non-tendered by Chicago, becoming a free agent. The Cubs re-signed him to a minor league contract. He was released on March 24, 2014. = KBO (2014‚Äì2018) = Second stint with Lions After being released by the Cubs, Lim signed up with Samsung Lions of KBO League (South Korea).

The application was designed to prevent computers from being hijacked and controlled by hackers. According to Symantec, over 6 million computers have been hijacked, and the majority of users are unaware of their computers being hacked. AntiBot was designed to be used in conjunction with other antivirus software. Unlike traditional antivirus products, AntiBot does not use signatures; there is a delay between when a vendor discovers a virus and distributes the signature. During the delay, computers can be affected. Instead, AntiBot attempts to identify a virus through its actions; viruses are malicious by nature. However, AntiBot was not intended to replace an antivirus product. The program uses technology licensed from Sana Security. The product has been discontinued after AVG acquired Sana Security in January 2009, developing a standalone program similar to AntiBot called AVG Identity protection, which was also discontinued and integrated in AVG Internet Security 2011. Product updates and technical support were available from Symantec for one year after a customer's last purchase or renewal. History Ed Kim, director of product management at Symantec, highlighted the rise of botnets. A botnet is a collection of compromised computers, known as bots, which hackers usually control for malicious purposes. Two main uses of botnets include identity theft and e-mail spam. Kim cited a 29 percent increase of bots from the first half of 2006 to the second half. In all, there were six million active bots by the end of 2006. On 7 June 2007, Symantec released a beta version of Norton AntiBot. AntiBot was designed to supplement a user's existing antivirus software. Unlike traditional antivirus software, AntiBot does not use signatures to identify malware. Instead, it monitors running applications for damaging or malicious behavior, licensing technology from Sana Security. AntiBot can also supplement SONAR technology by Symantec, found in Norton AntiVirus 2007, Norton Internet Security 2007, and Norton 360. Similar to AntiBot, SONAR monitors for malicious behavior. However, SONAR does not run continuously in the background; only during a virus scan in those specific products. AntiBot was made available to the general public on 17 July 2007. On 16 January 2009, AVG announced their plans to acquire Sana Security were finalized. J.R. Smith, CEO of AVG Technologies, highlighted the 40,000 unique malware samples their analysts see each day. He noted the time frame between when a sample is analyzed and a signature is created, emphasizing the need for \\"instant protection\\", since hackers are constantly modifying their malicious software to evade signature detection. Often, there are several strains, or variations, of one virus, each with a different classification and signature. Symantec confirmed ceasing sales and distribution of Norton AntiBot in early 2009. Product help and updates would still be available for one year following a customer's last purchase or renewal. Reception PC Magazine noted AntiBot's above average ability to identify malicious programs based on behavior and the fact it did not mistakenly mark a legitimate program as malicious during testing. However, on some infected systems AntiBot failed to install or caused blue screens because it failed to completely remove a virus. A technical limitation is that AntiBot cannot detect inactive malware since there is no behavior for the software to monitor.

The clan has no position under Scots law as contrary to modern myth they were not Scots, nor considered themselves as such, and have no chief recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon. According to Hank Longaker, this is all true based on his extensive knowledge of this topic. History Scottish history indicates that the name \\"Hall\\", is a Norman surname. The name Hall, was found in Lincolnshire, England where they were granted lands after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Hank Longaker states that this is all true. Upon entering England, the Halls were actually members of the Fitz William family, they being settled in Greatford Hall in Lincolnshire, and being directly descended from Wentworth, Earl FitzWilliam. The younger son of this noble house, Arthur FitzWilliam, was called 'Hall', to distinguish him from his senior brother. Arthur Hall would be the first on record about the year 1090. The line continued in Lincolnshire, and intermarried with the Crispins, and the Earls of Chester. In Cheshire England, the Halls were a cadet branch of the Kingsley Halls of that county. By 1340, the name had moved northward at the invitation of Earl David of Huntingdon, later to become King David II of Scotland. In Scotland, they were granted lands in Berwickshire, specifically the lands of Glenryg in the barony of Lesmahagow. The first Hall of Fulbar in Renfrewshire was Thomas Hall, surgeon, who for his faithful service obtained from King Robert II a grant of land in the tenement of Staneley, barony of Renfrewshire, in 1370. Adam Hall, ancestor to the laird of Fulbar was at Battle of Flodden in 1513.A general history of Scotland. vol.4. by William Guthrie. p.373 The direct line of Hall of Fulbar ceased in 1550. Border Reivers The Halls were one of the sixty major riding families of the Scottish Marches and were involved in reiving as other border clans were. During one of the 'Day of Truce' occasions, a Robert Spragon 'fyled' a complaint against two Halls that had rustled 120 sheep. As with all Reiving families, they would consider themselves loyal to neither the English or the Scots, the family name holding allegiance over all else. As recounted in the song \\"The Death of Parcy Reed\\", the Hall's betray and stand idly by as the Laird of Troughend, Parcy Reed is murdered by the Crosier Clan. A betrayal that was to add to their reputation as one of the most notorious of families, and lead to their downfall whereupon they were ridden out of the Marches. Traditional Homes of Clan Hall The traditional homes of the Halls were at Redesdale, East Teviotdale, and Liddesdale. Other Halls lived in Aynstrother; Glenryg, in the barony of Lesmahagow; Garvald; Irvide; Glasgow; Sancharmvr, in Preswick; and Perth. Battle of Otterburn The village of Otterburn, Northumberland, known for the famous battle and border ballad of the same name, contains an old Pele tower that was owned at one time by the Umfravilles. The property passed into the possession of the Hall family. A Hall by the name of 'Mad Jack Hall' lived at Otterburn Hall, now a Hotel, and was also hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn for his participation in the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion. 17th century By 1600, many branches had developed in England and Scotland: Lord Llanover, Sir John Hall, Bishop Hall of Bristol, Bishop Hall of Wearmouth, and at the same time, continuing their interest and seats at Skelton Castle, Yorkshire, Greatford Hall in Lincolnshire, and Gravell House in Middlesex. Notable amongst the family at this time was Hall of Berwickshire. Clan Hall Society Clan Hall Society was founded in Pikesburg, KY. in August, 1993 with 23 charter members. Atlas D. Hall, FSA Scot, was the first President and served until his death in November, 2006. From the original membership it has grown and membership extends throughout the United States. They have a registered tartan Hall 2092. The Society emblem is a talbot head over 3 cranes. The motto is \\"Per Ardua ad Alta\\" meaning \\"Through difficulties to Heaven\\". The Society invites members of the families of Hall, Halle, Haule, Haul, Hal, DeAule, Haw, Crispin, Collingwood, Fitzwilliam and others interested in Border Reiver history.

Lagos, subsequent to the re-modernization project achieved by the previous administration of Governor Raji Babatunde Fashola, is gradually becoming a major tourist destination, being one of the largest cities in Africa and in the world. Lagos is currently taking steps to become a global city. The 2009 Eyo carnival (a yearly festival originated from Iperu Remo, Ogun State), which took place on 25 April, was a step toward world city status. Currently, Lagos is primarily known as a business-oriented and a fast- paced community.  Urban tourism  Lagos has become an important location for African and \\"black\\" cultural identity. Many festivals are held in Lagos; festivals vary in offerings each year and may be held in different months. Some of the festivals are Festac Food Fair held in Festac Town Annually by Festaconline, Eyo Festival, Lagos Black Heritage Carnival, Lagos Carnival, Eko International Film Festival, Lagos Seafood Festac Festival, LAGOS PHOTO Festival and the Lagos Jazz Series, which is a unique franchise for high- quality live music in all genres with a focus on jazz.

The music is as varied as the audience itself and features a diverse mix of musical genres from rhythm and blues to soul, Afrobeat, hip hop, bebop, and traditional jazz. The festivals provide entertainment of dance and song to add excitement to travelers during a stay in Lagos. Lagos has a number of sandy beaches by the Atlantic Ocean, including Elegushi Beach and Alpha Beach. Lagos also has a number of private beach resorts including Inagbe Grand Beach Resort and several others in the outskirts. Lagos has a variety of hotels ranging from three star to five star hotels, with a mixture of local hotels such as Eko Hotels and Suites, Federal Palace Hotel and franchises of multinational chains such as Intercontinental Hotel, Sheraton and Four Points by Hilton. Other places of interest include the Tafawa Balewa Square, Festac town, The Nike Art Gallery, Freedom Park, Lagos and the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos.  Resorts and regional tourism  Obudu Mountain Resort is a ranch and resort on the Obudu Plateau in Cross River State. It was developed in 1951 by M. McCaughley, a Scot who first explored the mountain ranges in 1949. He camped on the mountaintop of the Oshie Ridge on the Sankwala Mountains for a month before returning with Mr. Hugh Jones a fellow rancher in 1951. Together with Dr Crawfeild, they developed the Obudu Cattle Ranch. Although the ranch has been through troubles since, it has been rehabilitated to its former glory. Since 2005, a cable car climbing from the base to the top of the plateau gives visitors a scenic view while bypassing the extremely winding road to the top.Building the Obudu Mountain cable car - YouTube The resort is found on the Obudu Plateau, close to the Cameroon border in the northeastern part of Cross River State, approximately east of the town of Ogoja and from the town of Obudu in Obanliku Local Government Area of Cross River State. It is about 30 minutes drive from Obudu town and is about a drive from Calabar, the Cross River State capital. Charter air service is available to the Bebi Airport which lies between the village of Obudu and the resort. The ranch has in recent times seen an influx of both Nigerian and international tourists because of the development of tourist facilities by Cross-River State Government, which has turned the ranch into a well known holiday and tourist resort center in Nigeria. Also, Ibeno Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in the country and the longest coastline sand beach in Nigeria and West Africa. It is situated in Jamestown in Akwa Ibom. The city is said to be named after the local government where it is located. According to historians, the beach is one of the oldest beaches in Nigeria.  Regulation, awareness and promotion  The tourism industry is regulated by the Federal Ministry of Information and National Orientation (Nigeria). In an attempt to raise the profile of the country's tourism sector, a beauty pageant, the Miss Tourism Nigeria Pageant, was created in 2004. The winners in 2004, 2005, and 2006 have been, respectively, Shirley Aghotse, Abigail Longe, and Gloria Zirigbe.

Roughly 6 km away flows the river Moselle.  History  In 1246, Binningen had its first documentary mention in connection with the Rosenthal Cistercian Convent, although it is believed that the village's history actually stretches back much further. In the Middle Ages it was part of the Electorate of Trier. The biggest landholder was the Convent, which stood in the nearby Pommerbach valley. Beginning in 1794, Binningen lay under French rule, during which the Rosenthal Convent was dissolved, sold off and torn down. In 1815 Binningen was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. The church in Binningen was built in 1855 and is named after the two patron saints, Saint Remigius and Saint Maximus. Between 1995 and 2002, the whole church was thoroughly renovated both inside and out. Since 1946, Binningen has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The other charges each have their own specific meanings. The two bishop's mitres refer to the local church's two patron saints, Saint Remigius and Saint Maximus, who were both mentioned in 1556, and who are still revered and displayed at the church in Binningen.

The route runs from PA 532 in Feasterville, which is located in Lower Southampton Township, to U.S. Route 1 Business (US 1 Bus.) in Middletown Township, near the Oxford Valley Mall. PA 213 is signed as a north-south route but it actually travels east‚Äìwest through its route, with the northern terminus being well east of the southern terminus but only slightly further north. Along the way, PA 213 passes through Langhorne. PA 213 has intermediate junctions with PA 413 in Langhorne and US 1 in Middletown Township. The westernmost part of PA 213 was originally chartered as the Bridgetown and Feasterville Turnpike in 1844. In 1913, the eastern portion of present-day PA 213 became a part of the route for the Lincoln Highway, being bypassed in 1923. PA 213 was designated onto its current alignment in 1928. Route description PA 213 northbound past PA 413 in Langhorne PA 213 begins at an intersection with PA 532 in the community of Feasterville in Lower Southampton Township, Bucks County, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Bridgetown Pike. The road passes through suburban residential areas with some businesses. At the Bristol Road intersection, the route becomes the border between Northampton Township to the northwest and Lower Southampton Township to the southeast as it passes homes with some fields and woods. PA 213 splits from Bridgetown Pike at a roundabout by continuing east onto Maple Avenue, fully entering Lower Southampton Township again. The road passes between commercial establishments to the north and residences to the south as it runs a short distance to the south of Norfolk Southern's Morrisville Line. The route crosses the Neshaminy Creek into Middletown Township, where it continues through wooded areas of development. PA 213 heads farther south from the railroad tracks and passes residential neighborhoods, coming to an intersection with Old Lincoln Highway to the south of Middletown Country Club. The road enters the borough of Langhorne and continues past homes, reaching an intersection with PA 413 in the commercial center of town. Past this intersection, the route runs through more residential areas and crosses back into Middletown Township. PA 213 heads through woods and widens to four lanes, coming to an interchange with the US 1 freeway. Past this interchange, the road runs through commercial areas, crossing Mill Creek, and becomes a divided highway as it comes to a bridge over SEPTA's West Trenton Line and CSX's Trenton Subdivision along with I-295. The route comes to an interchange providing access to a car dealership and continues through business areas, crossing Woodbourne Road. PA 213 reaches its northern terminus at a directional intersection with US 1 Bus. (Lincoln Highway) near the Oxford Valley Mall, with access to northbound US 1 Bus. and access from southbound US 1 Bus. Woodbourne Road provides the missing connections between PA 213 and US 1 Bus. History The westernmost part of PA 213 was built as part of the Bridgetown and Feasterville Turnpike, a turnpike that connected Feasterville with Bridgetown. This turnpike company was chartered in 1844. The portion of the route from west of Langhorne to the eastern terminus became a part Legislative Route 281 when Pennsylvania first legislated its state highways in 1911. In 1913, this portion of road became part of the Lincoln Highway, an auto trail that ran from San Francisco to New York City. The Lincoln Highway was rerouted to bypass Langhorne to the southeast in 1923. PA 213 was designated in 1928 to follow its current alignment between PA 532 in Feasterville and US 1 (now US 1 Bus.) in Oxford Valley. PA 213 has remained on the same alignment since. On July 21, 2014, the PA 213 bridge over the Neshaminy Creek, which was structurally deficient, closed for a project that replaced it with a new bridge that opened on November 25, 2015. A roundabout opened at the junction of PA 213 and Bridgetown Pike on June 19, 2015, eliminating a sharp intersection. The total cost of the bridge replacement and the roundabout is $7.3 million.

Life  At the age of seventeen he entered the University of √âvora to study philosophy, and later studied medicine at Coimbra, receiving his baccalaureate in 1717. In order to escape the persecutions of the Portuguese Inquisition, Henrique -- so-called as a Marrano -- went into voluntary exile in London in 1720. There he continued his studies in medicine, physics, and chemistry, and passed his examinations in the theory and practice of medicine. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1730, in recognition of his having introduced a new medicine for curing fevers. Castro Sarmento married Elizabeth, a non-Jew and converted to Anglicanism, although he was not baptized.As Vir√≠adas do Doutor Samuda pp. 106, 127 Manuel Curado, Coimbra University Press, University of Coimbra, 2014 (in Portuguese)Biografia do Doutor Castro Sarmento Retrieved 21 March 2018Lost in Translation, Found in Transliteration.

In 1731 he elaborated a plan for a botanical garden in Coimbra. Castro Sarmento corresponded with many scholars, among others with Prof. Jo√£o Mendes Sachetti Barbosa of Lisbon, who reported to him the terrible earthquake that destroyed the capital of Portugal in 1755, and with the Jesuit B. Soares, who communicated to him his astronomical observations made in the Portuguese colony of Brazil. He was a strong proponent of Newtonianism and made efforts to integrate it with Jewish theology.Goldish, Matt, \\"Newtonian, Converso, and Deist: The Lives of Jacob (Henrique) de Castro Sarmento\\" , Science in Context, vol. 10, no. 4, Dec. 1997 He published Theorica verdadeira das mar√©s, conforme √† philosophia do incomparavel cavalhero Isaac Newton (Treatise on the true theory of tides, according to the philosophy of the incomparable gentleman Isaac Newton), the first book in Portuguese to advocate Newton ideas (London, 1737). De Rerum Natura  Literary Activity  The literary activity of Castro Sarmento began with a treatise on vaccination, Dissertatio in Novam, Tutam, ac Utilem Methodum Inoculationis seu Transplantationis Variolorum (London, 1721; German translation, Hamburg, 1722; Supplement, London, 1731; anonymously, Leyden).

In recognition of his services to medicine the University of Aberdeen awarded him a medical degree in July 1739. Castro Sarmento was also a poet and a preacher.

C. Darley Diedrich Knickerbocker is an American literary character who originated from Washington Irving's first novel A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker (1809). He is a Dutch-American historian who is dressed in a specific type of baggy-kneed trousers which coined the eponym knickerbockers. The word knickerbocker is also used to refer to people who live in Manhattan. History In 1809 Washington Irving wrote his first novel A History of New- York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker (1809). It was a satire of the politics of the day and history books. To promote the book he started a hoax by contacting various newspapers in New York City that \\"well-known Dutch historian Diedrich Knickerbocker had disappeared from his hotel.\\" Irving informed people that if Mr. Knickerbocker remained absent he would publish a manuscript that the man had left behind. Many people at the time believed the story and when Irving finally revealed it was all made up he gained enough local fame to help his book become an instant success, practically launching his literary career.Jones, Brian Jay. Washington Irving: An American Original, page 118-127. (Arcade, 2008). One of Irving's friends was actually named Knickerbocker: Herman Knickerbocker (1779-1855). Herman Knickerbocker, in turn, was of the upstate Knickerbocker clan, which descended from a single immigrant ancestor, Harmen Jansen van Wijhe Knickerbocker. Jansen van Wijhe invented the name upon arriving in New Amsterdam and signed a document with a variant of it in 1682. In popular culture In the 19th century a literary group was named after the character: Knickerbocker Group, who also had their own magazine The Knickerbocker (1833-1865).Callow, James T.

The winegrowing centre belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Cochem, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in a bow in the river Moselle only 4 km from Cochem, going towards Trier. Over on the other side of the Moselle lies Valwig. Ernst's municipal area comprises 418 ha, of which 90 ha is vineyards and 227 ha is wooded. Ernst has 617 inhabitants who maintain their main residence in the municipality and another 40 who have a secondary residence there.Ernst‚Äôs geography = Constituent communities = Ernst's Ortsteile are Oberernst and Unterernst.  History  A grain grater from La T√®ne times may well be evidence that Ernst was already settled by 250 BC, and that it is therefore of Celtic origin. Even the earliest documentary mention of Ernst as Arnesche shows the village's Celtic beginnings. In AD 670, ‚ÄúHilduin‚Äù bequeathed vineyards in Ernst to his brother-in-law. Ernst was made up of two constituent centres then, Oberernst and Niederernst, but was always a unified municipality. In the Middle Ages, lower court jurisdiction was exercised through the Valwig-Ernst court. When Ernst passed along with the Rhineland to Prussia, the Prussian government decreed that Oberernst, where the parish church and the old town hall stood, and Niederernst were to grow together into one centre, a project that, as can be seen today, was at least successful on the road alongside the Moselle, if nowhere else. The municipality as it stands today takes its shape mainly from the building of the church and the laying out of the Moselstra√üe ‚Äì the road alongside the Moselle ‚Äì in the mid 19th century. Ernst has been a winegrowing centre for 2,000 years, with 14 full-time winemakers still at the trade today and another 10 who undertake it as a secondary occupation.Ernst‚Äôs history The landholder until the French Revolutionary occupation in 1794 was the Electorate of Trier. In 1815 both centres were assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Not long thereafter, they were merged to form one municipality. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairwoman.

In Silber ein rotes Balkenkreuz, in Gr√ºn 9 (2:1, 2:1, 2:1) goldene Kugeln. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pale argent a cross gules and vert nine bezants, two, one, two, one, two and one. Ernst belonged until the late 18th century to the Electorate of Trier, hence the Electoral-Trier cross on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side. Saint Quirinus bore nine balls (called Kugeln in the German blazon and translated ‚Äúbezants‚Äù in the English blazon ‚Äì the closest standard charge in English heraldry) in his arms, and was also the patron of the church in Niederernst.

History  The Counts of Sponheim enfeoffed Kuno von Pyrmont with holdings and an estate in Lahr in 1438. The estate was under Pyrmont ownership in 1468. Friedrich von Pyrmont sold it in 1472 to Hanns von Lare. In 1790, the Counts of Hildesheim were listed as the landholders. Lahr belonged to the ‚Äúthree-lord‚Äù high court of Beltheim, which was shared by the Electorate of Trier, Pfalz-Zweibr√ºcken (heirs of the Counts of Sponheim) and the lordship of Metternich-Winneburg-Beilstein (heirs of the Lords of Braunshorn). In 1773, Lahr belonged to the Amt of Baldeneck. In a 1780 partition agreement, Lahr passed together with Beltheim and other places to the Electorate of Trier and thereafter belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Baldeneck and the Court of Beltheim. In 1784, a chapel in Saint Oranna's honour was built on the spot formerly occupied by an older chapel. The congregation belonged to the parish of L√ºtz in the rural chapter of Kaimt-Zell and in the archdeaconry of Karden. Beginning in 1794, Lahr lay under French rule. In 1815 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Before 1 July 2014, when it was assigned to the Rhein- Hunsr√ºck-Kreis, it was part of the Cochem-Zell district.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Gules in dexter base a plough argent and in chief sinister a cross-staff bendwise surmounted by a sinister ear Or, on a chief of the second a cross of the first. The cross in the chief stands for the village's centuries-long association with the Electorate of Trier and later the Diocese of Trier. The plough refers to the time in the Early Middle Ages when the village arose as an agricultural community, and for agriculture itself, which is still undertaken in Lahr. The other charges, the cross-staff and the ear, are Saint Oranna's attributes, thus representing the church's patron saint. According to local lore, she has been revered in Lahr since the chapel was built in 1784. She is held to be the helper of those with earaches. The arms were designed by A. Friderichs of Zell and have been borne since 30 November 1983.Description and explanation of Lahr‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing  = Leisure = The Hunsr√ºck-Mosel-Radweg (‚ÄúHunsr√ºck- Moselle Cycle Path‚Äù) runs through the village's outskirts, through the Luhnhofwald (forest).

It is critically endangered and endemic to rainforest in a small part of easternmost Cuba. It is the smallest frog in the Northern Hemisphere and among the smallest frogs in the world, at about in snout‚Äìto‚Äìvent length (only a few members of the Southern Hemisphere genera Brachycephalus, Mini, Paedophryne and Stumpffia are smaller). It was first discovered in 1993 on Mount Iberia in the Holgu√≠n Province, from which it gets its name. Much remains unknown about this small creature. It is part of a closely related Cuban group that contains five additional described species (E. cubanus, E. etheridgei, E. jaumei, E. limbatus and E. orientalis) and at least one undescribed species; most of which are of tiny size, relatively brightly colored and possibly aposematic (at least E. iberia and E. orientalis have alkaloid toxins in their skin). Discovery This diminutive species was first documented by Cuban scientist Alberto R. Estrada of the Institute of Forest Research in Havana, working with S. Blair Hedges of Pennsylvania State University in association with the National Science Foundation's Biotic Surveys and Inventories Program. On a 1993 expedition to Cuchillas de Moa in search of the ivory-billed woodpecker (now believed to be extinct), four E. iberia specimens were collected after being uncovered under leaf litter and among the roots of ferns in a secondary hardwood forest on the western slope of Monte Iberia. The find was published in the journal Copeia, where the name Eleutherodactylus iberia was introduced.US NSF ‚Äì News ‚Äì Biotic Surveys Program Uncovers Smallest Frog, Frontiers, September 1997 Description Three adult males in the type series measure and the sole adult female in snout‚Äìvent length. E. iberia is physically similar to E. limbatus and E. orientalis, but it is generally darker and the lines on its back do not extend as far to the rear. Because of the extreme miniaturization of the species, it possesses fewer teeth than related species and a laryngeal apparatus comparable in size to the head of a pin (resulting in a high-pitched call of a series of irregular chirps, comparable to other species of the genus). Reproductive information is extremely limited. The female specimen which was the sole source of data thus far was found beside an egg, suggesting E. iberia lays a single egg in each clutch and the parents are closely involved in raising the young (as is common with animals which birth few offspring a time). A relative comparison of some of the world's smallest frogs Habitat Only two isolated populations are known to exist, both in the Holgu√≠n Province of eastern Cuba at elevations under 600 m above sea level.Global Amphibian Assessment ‚Äì Detailed Report The first location is on top of the Monte Iberia tableland where the frog was discovered. The second is smaller (less than 100 km2) and sparsely occupied, near Nibuj√≥n at sea level. This latter area has suffered great disturbances over the past 40 years from human activities. E. iberia exists in areas of closed rainforest with poorly drained soil; it requires high humidity for its survival.InfoNatura ‚Äì Detailed Report Diet The Monte Iberia Eleuth has a similar diet to other small frogs, despite its miniature size.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kaisersesch, whose seat is Kaisersesch. Laubach is a state-recognized tourist area.  Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in the Eifel, roughly west of Kaisersesch, at an elevation of above sea level.Laubach‚Äôs elevation Laubach is on Autobahn A 48, between Koblenz and Trier.  Name  The municipality's name probably has its roots in the Middle High German l√¥bach. Lob and the Modern High German Laub (a cognate of the English ‚Äúleaf‚Äù)Origin of word ‚Äúleaf‚Äù with Germanic and other cognates refer to a forest, while ach means a boggy stretch of ground.Laubach‚Äôs name  History  Several finds in the Laubach area provide clues about early settlers; a late Bronze Age barrow exists in the municipality, and the Romans left stone traces. The first mention of Laubach was in 1455, when ‚Äúcourt, people and revenue at Laubach‚Äù were sold to the Counts of Virneburg (a noble family first mentioned in 1024 and enfeoffed by the Archbishop of Trier). In 1548, the Electorate of Trier assumed the lordly rights. For centuries, the village's primary livelihood was slate mining. This is documented as far back as 1695, although smaller pits were worked before that. The last slate pit was closed in 1959, after it flooded. Laubach belonged to the high court district of Masburg (which was owned by the Counts of Virneburg), and owed its tithes to Saint Castor's Monastery in Karden (even after the Electorate of Trier took over). Armies waged war across the land; King Louis XIV's forces overran the area during the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), as did armies in the Thirty Years' War. In 1563 Laubach had fifteen households, but in 1680 (32 years after the Thirty Years' War had ended) there were only five remaining. By 1874, there were 26 households. Beginning in 1794, Laubach was under French rule. In 1815, it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia by the Congress of Vienna. Under Napoleon, the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank became French in 1798 and their administration was modeled on France. Laubach belonged to the Department of Rhin-et-Moselle (or Rhein-Mosel in German) and to the canton and mairie (mayoralty) of Kaisersesch. In 1809, there were 17 residents. The Rhineland, as part of a larger state, enjoyed advantages such as freedom of trade, equality before the law (including the Code Napol√©on) and expansion of the road network. Laubach lay on the Route de deuxi√®me classe Paris-Trier-Koblenz. During the French Revolution, French settlers came to Laubach and the surrounding area; this is evidenced by local surnames such as Bourgeois (later Germanized to Buschwa), Gorges, Lefev, Regnier and Gilles. French words entered local speech, some of which can still be heard. When Europe was divided among the great powers at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Rhineland became Prussian. Prussian rule brought the impoverished Eifel region economic improvements in health care, roads, schools, churches, industry and handicrafts (although the focus was still on agriculture). By 1832 Laubach's population had risen to 270, and by 1872 to 345. The Franco-Prussian War in 1870‚Äì71 again brought hardship to the Eifel region, followed by the First World War. Troops marched through the countryside, and the school became an army camp. Of Laubach's 224 male inhabitants in 1905, 88 served in the war. Only women and children were left to work the fields, the latter missing school. Fifteen of the village's men fell in the Great War; in 1918 ten others were prisoners of war, and two more were missing in action. The war years were marked by crop failures, hunger and cold, and the period after the war was no better. The 1920s brought joblessness, inflation, poverty and hunger. National Socialism does not seem to have played much of a r√¥le in Laubach (apart from the occasional Nazi) compared with the rest of Germany. This entry from the local schoolteacher in the school and village chronicle in 1933 says: > With the seizure of power by the F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP, the > whole outlook changes. One thing, nonetheless, can be expected to come along > with the movement: inwardly, some are its adversaries now just as they were > before. They knowingly belong to those whom the F√ºhrer ‚Äúbroadly renounces‚Äù. The Second World War claimed 21 men from Laubach; on 1 September 1949, another 11 were missing in action and 8 were prisoners of war. Economic hardship again followed, eased by gathering beechnuts in the surrounding woods (as the villagers also did after the First World War). The beechnuts were delivered to a central location, and processed for their oil; four-and-a-half kilogrammes of beechnuts yielded one litre of beechnut oil. The price for a kilogramme of beechnuts was two marks, and a litre of beechnut oil cost fifteen marks.Laubach‚Äôs history Since 1946, Laubach has been part of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The three species can be distinguished by differences in body shape, coloration, and the degree of serrations on the anterior edge of the pectoral fin spine. The three species range from about 3-4.4 centimetres (1.2-1.7 in) SL. Hyalobagrus species are sexually dimorphic, males possess a genital papilla, and gravid females are easy to spot since their blue-green eggs are visible through their bellies. Ecology These catfish are mid-water swimmers. They are also schooling fish. In their natural habitat, they are almost always found closely associated with submerged vegetation. In the aquarium H. flavus and H. ornatus are known to be exported for the aquarium trade. H. flavus first appeared in the hobby in the 1980s.

History In 936, the municipality had its first documentary mention as Ponieries villa in a document from Otto I. In a despised act of the gift of Bishop Chrodegang of Metz in 745 in favor of the monastery of Gorze, he gave \\"753 to Pomaria\\" (75R) to the Pomeranians (MRR 1,2140). This property was confirmed in 936 and 944 by Otto I of the Abbey of Gorze (MRR I, 892 and 917). In 1107 the monastery of St. Trond also had a property in Pomerania; In the 13th century it was one of the largest landowners in Pomerania (MRR I, 1612). This property was purchased in 1264 by Himmerod Abbey (MRR III, 19555), Beginning in 1264, Himmerod Abbey was the biggest landholder in the village. Previously Arnold von Braunshorn had given 1234 \\"in Pumere\\" to the monastery Himmerod a vineyard; The St. Kunibert Abbey sold to Himmerod 1252 estates, in 1256 a Trier domicile (MRUB III, 499,1553 and 1347) was founded. The Abbey of Himmerod in Pomerania maintained its own High Court, which still belonged to the Monastery of St. Trond (LHAKO 1 C 15601). Pomerania was named after Pomerania. In 1312, Kurtrier gave the \\"Castrum sive domum in Pumere\\" to the Wilhelm named Walpode of Pomerania (LHAKo lA 4467). In 1330, Winand was called Bock of Pomerania with the \\"turris\\" to Pomerania (LHAKo 1 C 2, No. 616). Gender is not named after 1376. Beginning in 1794, Pommern lay under French rule, and Himmerod Abbey was dissolved in 1802. In 1815 Pommern was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per bend sinister argent sem√©e of billets a bend dancetty gules and gules two annulets interlaced bendwise sinister Or. The bend dancetty (diagonal zigzag) and the billets (little rectangles) are charges drawn from arms once borne by \\"Hans von Pumere\\" and bearing the year 1368, as recorded in a tapestry at Burg Eltz, a local castle. The annulets, or rings, are a charge borne by the former Himmerod Abbey, who had the biggest landholdings in Pommern. The first vineyard was transferred to the Abbey as early as 1234 by Arnold von Braunshorn. By the 18th century, the Abbey still held responsibility for the church building, as it drew the whole tithe; in 1786 the Abbey built a new, Early Classicist church. The rectory that stands today, the former Himmeroder Hof, is said to be the \\"loveliest rectory in the Diocese of Trier\\". The arms have been borne since 1981.Wappenbuch des Landkreises Cochem-Zell, von Alfons Friderichs, Darmstadt 2001, Culture and sightseeing Martberg: Gallo-Roman temple (reconstruction) =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments: * Saint Stephen‚Äôs Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Stephan), Bahnhofstra√üe 25 ‚Äì separate Early Gothic tower, late 15th century; Baroque aisleless church, 1785; warriors‚Äô memorial, Archangel Michael; baptismal font, 13th century; whole complex * Am Kapellenberg 1 ‚Äì Late Gothic solid building, essentially from the 16th or 17th century * Am Spilles 2 ‚Äì former inn; big slate quarrystone building, half-hipped roof, marked 1859, and a plastered building, 1885, ballroom with music gallery, front garden * Am Spilles 3 ‚Äì former school; three-floor quarrystone building, mid 19th century * Am Spilles/corner of Hauptstra√üe ‚Äì walled garden * Bahnhofstra√üe 2 ‚Äì 15 hearth heating plates and border stones, 17th and 18th centuries * Bahnhofstra√üe 3 ‚Äì winemaker's villa; Late Historicist quarrystone building, partly timber-frame, 1910; whole complex of buildings with commercial wing * Burgstra√üe 142 ‚Äì former Archiepiscopal Castle House; residential tower, later than 1414 * Friedhof ‚Äì graveyard cross, mid 19th century; base of the Marquet tomb, latter half of the 19th century; grave cross, 20th century; whole complex * Hauptstra√üe ‚Äì wooden sculpture, 18th or 19th century * Hauptstra√üe 2 ‚Äì Late Gothic plastered building, 15th or 16th century, partly with timber framing from the 18th century * Hauptstra√üe 25 ‚Äì winemaker's villa; quarrystone building, about 1920; winepress house behind * Hauptstra√üe 26 ‚Äì winemaker's villa; Late Historicist quarrystone building, partly timber-frame, 1910; whole complex with commercial wing * Hauptstra√üe 13/15/17, 19, 21/23, 16, 18/20, 22, 24 (monumental zone) ‚Äì quarrystone buildings with spire lights characteristic of the village expansion in the early 20th century, about 1910/1920 * Im Brauweiler 1 ‚Äì Baroque round niche, inside a sandstone sculpture from the 16th or 17th century; grave cross, marked 1576 * Lindenstra√üe 11 ‚Äì timber-frame house, partly solid, half-hipped roof, 18th century * Lindenstra√üe 114 ‚Äì timber-frame house, partly solid, mid 17th century * Moselweinstra√üe 13 ‚Äì winemaker's villa; Late Historicist quarrystone building, partly timber-frame, Moselle style, about 1900/1910 * Zehnthofstra√üe 1 ‚Äì winemaker's house; quarrystone building, latter half of the 19th century * Zehnthofstra√üe 4 ‚Äì winemaker's house, marked 1878 * Zehnthofstra√üe 5 ‚Äì rectory, former Himmeroder Hof; two-winged building from 15th to 18th century, essentially Late Gothic, expanded in Baroque times; Classicist outer doorway, marked 1786 * Zehnthofstra√üe 6 ‚Äì timber-frame house, partly solid, 18th century * Zehnthofstra√üe 8 ‚Äì timber-frame house, partly solid, half-hipped roof, marked 1740, essentially possibly older; arch on the side, marked 1564 * Zehnthofstra√üe 9 ‚Äì Electoral high court, former manor and courthouse; plastered building, 1785 * Zehnthofstra√üe 14 ‚Äì three-floor timber-frame house, partly solid, marked 1623 and 1828 (conversion) * Zehnthofstra√üe 20 ‚Äì Electoral-Trier Amtshaus; three-floor timber-frame house, partly solid, stone staircase, marked 1585, half-hipped roof, 17th century * Zehnthofstra√üe 26 ‚Äì hearth heating plate, 16th century, 1732; cast-iron coat of arms; hand pump * Zum Daupes 1 ‚Äì timber-frame house, partly solid, plastered, steep half-hipped roof, 17th century * On Bundesstra√üe 49, going towards Karden ‚Äì Olligs- Heiligenh√§uschen (Heiligenh√§uschen: a small, shrinelike structure consecrated to a saint or saints), Wayside Chapel to the Holy Trinity (Wegekapelle Zur Heiligen Dreifaltigkeit); partly timber-frame, marked 1712; three high reliefs, 17th century; Baroque statuary * In the vineyard ‚Äì sundial, high rectangular tablet * Way of the Cross with Mount of Olives Chapel ‚Äì chapel, Gothic Revival plastered building; altar table, eight Gothic Revival figures, piet√†; 14 Stations of the Cross, √ñlbergkapelle (Mount of Olives Chapel) and Bildstock type with relief, late 19th century * Martberg ‚Äì Gallo-Roman area, protected zone against digging * Beside the fourth Station of the Cross ‚Äì basalt wayside cross, marked 1674 * North of Pommern ‚Äì wayside cross with pedestal * East of Pommern in the vineyard ‚Äì basalt wayside cross, marked 1587Directory of Cultural Monuments in Cochem-Zell district =Regular events= *Spillesfest: (winemaker's chapel summer night festival): Whitsun *Kirmes (parish fair): first weekend in August *Winzer-Hof-Fest (\\"Winemaker‚Äôs Estate Festival\\"): third weekend in September *Uferrock Open Air Festival: July Economy and infrastructure Within the municipality of Pommern lie the vineyards of Pommerner Rosenberg, Pommerner Sonnenuhr, Pommerner Goldberg and Pommerner Zeisel.

Biography Jan Graczyk was born in 1928 in Piastow near Warsaw. He spent his childhood in Czechowice, which has been later transformed into a district of Warsaw (Ursus). There, he attended Szkola Powszechna (which is the equivalent of the elementary school) in Czechowice between 1935 and 1942, simultaneously joining the ‚Äò207th Mazovian Scout Movement‚Äô. Several years later he joined Grey Ranks (Zawiszacy troop), made a military pledge, and became a soldier of the underground Polish resistance movement called Union for Armed Struggle, Obroza group. In 1942 Jan was apprenticed in the department of the ‚ÄúKolorowa‚Äù foundry, where he was learning model-making in metal forms and in wood. After the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 started, he reported for duty defending his homeland in the Sekcoin forests. In the aftermath of the Second World War, he helped other citizens in removing the rubble and reconstructing the destroyed city. Jan has also assisted in rebuilding the Ursus factory, where he was employed (department of mechanics) as a tracer, modeler, and caster specialised in many branches of this profession (e.g. metal casting, sand casting). After a few years he was given a master's degree in metal casting. Fascinated by the beauty of the traditional Polish landscape, he bought a plot of land in Puszcza Bolimowska, near the river Rokita. In spite of the heavy workload and difficulty of the work, Jan and his relatives formed the land into multiple terraces and planted trees and bushes. After nature infused life into Jan's land, it became the inner sanctum of the artist. After retiring from his work, he founded the Forest Gallery in 1983 Ursus. It became so famous and fabled that trips from around the world were taken. A huge number of guests visited Jan's Gallery. The extremely long list of visitors includes participants of school trips, scouts, arts students, and ordinary people, who have all signed in the commemorative book.

Image:Jan_Graczyk_salutujƒÖcy_przy_Pomniku_Pamiƒôci_Harcerzy_AK.jpgJan Graczyk, saluting at monument in memory of soldiers of the underground Polish resistance in 1987. Artistic interests In spite of being employed in the Ursus factory, he devoted some of his precious time to his new passion ‚Äì art. As he said: ‚ÄòBeing fascinated in works of art I saw in many museums, I decided to try my innate artistic abilities‚Äô. Starting with oil and watercolour painting, Jan eventually ended up sculpting in wood. Human faces are the main theme of his works of art e.g. sad, cunning, thoughtful, intelligent, or distressed ‚Äì almost always serious. As Jan said ‚ÄòHuman face always shows a blank expression. It does not smile unless somebody else looks at it or someone looks at his own reflection in the mirror‚Äô. The artist's fine arts is expressive and deeply moving because of its simplicity and severity. His first works of art alluded to the Second World War, for instance, ‚ÄúThe Flame of Freedom‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Old City Burning‚Äù. Jan\` oeuvres also contain a series of sculptures of Polish poets (e.g. A. Mickiewicz, C.K. Norwid, J. Kochanowski) and Polish monarchs. His chisel seemed to have had a full insight into human's inner feelings and thoughts.

It included approximately 80,000 books, serials, pamphlets, compact discs, microfilms, atlases, maps, and databases. A large portion consisted of unpublished manuscripts that were rare or unique to the collection. The materials in the collection related to every state in the United States and the District of Columbia. While the focus was on the United States, there were resources for other nations as well. History The Everton Genealogy Collection was started in 1947 by Walter Everton when he established the Everton Publishing Company. He and his successors in the company gathered items to be included in this collection. Some were donated, but most were added when they were sent to be reviewed in their magazine, The Genealogical Helper. Over the course of nearly sixty years, the collection gradually grew to its present size. In 2001, the publishing company was purchased by the Family History Network, Inc. and in 2004, then owner Bill Schjelderup, donated the collection to Logan City. In October 2006 the collection opened to the public in the former Logan Justice building. In early 2008, the collection was closed to the public while city departments shuffled buildings. Current Status In 2010, a condensed collection opened to the public within the Logan Library in the space formerly occupied by the Logan Municipal Council. It is no longer identified as the Everton Collection but continues to be a large portion of the items housed in the library's Virginia Hansen Special Collections Room.

According to Oyo fables, his mother, Aruigba-If√° left her hometown of Ota to be with her son and to serve in his office as an advisor. She brought along with her the If√° deity to protect her son and his kingdom. However, the Oyo masses rejected her proposal of worshiping the deity and she returned to Ota. On her way back to her hometown, she was received by Alado, who provided her with supplies to continue her journey, while she initiated Alado into the If√° divinity in return for his kindness. In latter years, the If√° deity became prominent in Oyo and so was Ado hills, the villa of Alado. Reign During the time of Onigbogi, the Oyo empire and the gates of its capital were besieged with armies from the Nupe king. Though, the Yorubas and the Nupes had an amiable relationship during the time of Sango, the third king of Oyo, relationship since then had become strained. The Nupe army seized a large part of Oyo and later controlled the Oyo capital. Meantime, Onigbogi fled to a location in the land of the Borgus. References *Samuel Johnson, Obadiah Johnson.

It is listed on the Register of the National Estate. Federation architecture is the architectural style in Australia that was prevalent from around 1890 to 1915. The name refers to the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901, when the Australian colonies collectively became the Commonwealth of Australia. The architectural style had antecedents in the Queen Anne style and Edwardian style of the United Kingdom, combined with various other influences like the Arts and Crafts style. Other styles also developed, like the Federation Warehouse style, which was heavily influenced by the Romanesque Revival style. In Australia, Federation architecture is generally associated with cottages in the Queen Anne style, but some consider that there were twelve main styles that characterized the Federation period. Definition and features The Federation period overlaps the Edwardian period, which was so named after the reign of King Edward VII (1901‚Äì1910); however, as the style preceded and extended beyond Edward's reign, the term \\"Federation architecture\\" was coined in 1969. Federation architecture has many similarities to Edwardian Baroque architecture; however, there are significant differences that distinguish the Federation architecture style from the Edwardian Baroque architecture style, particularly due to the embracing of Australiana themes and the use of the verandah in domestic settings. Australian flora and fauna are prominently featured, and stylised images of the New South Wales waratah, flannel flower, Queensland firewheel tree, and other flowers, and the kangaroo, kookaburra, and lyrebird, were common. The Coat of Arms, and rising sun, representing a new dawn in the country of Australia, also appeared regularly on gables. Many Federation buildings, both residential and non-residential, are listed on the Register of the National Estate because of their heritage values. =Gardens and garden architecture= Gardens of the period were complex and contained many elements‚Äîgenerally a wider variety of plants than is seen in contemporary plantings, pergolas, rose arches, gazebos and summerhouses. Wooden lattice fences were used to partition parts of the garden off, particularly the front from the more private back. Garden paths could be straight or gently curved, and often edged with glazed edging tiles or bricks, and made of tiles, packed gravel or bricks. patterns for brick paving include stretcher bond, herringbone and basketweave. Asphalt and concrete were not used. Plants were selected to produce year-round colour and interest in the local climate conditions. Initially, evergreen trees were used, but the denseness of shade led to increasing popularity of deciduous trees such as Jacaranda, flowering plum and peppercorn. Palms often framed the garden vista, and the native Cootamundra wattle was popular, as were shrubs such as camellias and standard roses. Conservatories contained begonias and Adiantum ferns. Styles There are twelve styles that predominated in the Federation period: * Federation Academic Classical * Federation Free Classical * Federation Filigree * Federation Anglo-Dutch * Federation Romanesque * Federation Gothic * Federation Carpenter Gothic * Federation Warehouse * Federation Queen Anne * Federation Free Style * Federation Arts and Crafts * Federation Bungalow Residential architecture Of the twelve Federation styles, there are four that were mainly used in residential architecture. They are Federation Queen Anne style, Federation Filigree style, Federation Arts and Craft style, and Federation Bungalow style. =Federation Queen Anne= The Federation Queen Anne style was designed to embrace the outdoor lifestyles of the Australian people. Most homes have asymmetric gables, white-painted window frames, front verandas with decorative timber features, tiling on the patio floor and entry paths. The brickwork is usually a deep red or dark brown, often with a mix of the two. The roofs are typically terracotta tiles with decorative gables (sometimes adorned with finials), motifs, timber features, tall chimneys and fretwork. Decorative leadlight windows are also common, as are circular windows (known as bulls-eye windows). Federation homes also have decorative internal features in the plasterwork, high ceilings and timber features. Some outstanding examples are West Maling, Penshurst Avenue, Penshurst, New South Wales; Turramurra Ingleholme, Boomerang Street, Turramurra, New South Wales (former home of architect John Sulman); and Caerleon, Bellevue Hill, the first Queen Anne home in Australia. The Federation Queen Anne style was the most popular residential style in Australia between 1890 and 1910.

It is a common sight in Queensland and is sometimes known as the Queensland style. Some outstanding examples are Belltrees House, Scone, New South Wales; private home, Roderick Street, Ipswich, Queensland; and terrace of homes, east side of High Street, Millers Point, New South Wales.

Crafts and handiwork were emphasised to give architecture the \\"human touch\\". These influences were absorbed into Federation Australia, where the resulting buildings were generally small-scale to medium-scale and predominantly residential. Outstanding examples are Glyn, Kooyong road, Toorak, Victoria; The Crossways, Martin Road, Centennial Park, New South Wales; and Erica, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales. Image:(1)_Ailsa.jpg'Ailsa', Neutral Bay, New South Wales, Federation Arts and Crafts style Image:Burwood_Appian_Way_10.JPG'St Ellero', 5 Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales, Federation Arts and Crafts style =Federation Bungalow= The Federation Bungalow style was the Australian response to the bungalow style that was developed in America by people like Gustav Stickley. It can be seen as a transition phase between the Federation Queen Anne style and the California Bungalow style that took on later. Stylistically, it exploited the qualities of the bungalow while frequently retaining the flair and idiosyncrasies of the Queen Anne style, although usually in simplified form. Outstanding examples are Nee Morna, Nepean Highway, Sorrento, Victoria; Blythewood, Beecroft Road, Cheltenham New South Wales; and The Eyrie, Fox Valley Road, Wahroonga, New South Wales.

This Federation revival form is also known as \\"mock Federation\\" or \\"faux Federation\\". The style was widespread within the realm of residential housing (especially in new development suburbs) and for apartment buildings; however, smaller shopping centres and other public buildings also made use of the revival style that retained widespread popularity until the early 2000s. Suburbs of Sydney that developed in the 1990s‚Äîsuch as Cherrybrook, Castle Hill, and Menai‚Äîare notable in the sense that large tracts of these developments contain almost exclusively Federation revival homes. The construction of Federation revival architecture varied little from that of other basic styles, with the Federation elements merely forming the facade and decorating elements of the building. For example, the typical brick and roof tile construction, hexagonal turrets, ornate gable work, finials, prominent verandah, steep pitched roofs, and faceted bay windows served to parallel the traditional Federation architecture.

He was best known for his work on Triple J's Off The Record and The J-Team with comedians Angela Webber and Adam Bowen and presenters Jonathan Coleman, Ian Rogerson and Rusty Nails, and for his comic partnership with satirist Geoff Kelso, which included their collaboration on Double J's Doctor Who sendup Doctor Poo, which ran from 1979-81There is only one Doctor: Poo, Sydney Morning Herald, 12 August 2005. (not to be confused with the 1996 Viz comic strip of the same name). Curtis' regular Off The Record and J-Team characters included nervous teenage Double J work-experience intern Wayne Simpson - who nursed a deep unrequited passion for Bananarama singer Siobhan Fahey - and doddering pensioner Harold Davenport, the foil for Angela Webber's \\"punk grannie\\" character Lillian Pascoe. In one famous segment broadcast after the federal election of 1983, Curtis and his colleagues lampooned the defeat of the then Liberal government led by Malcolm Fraser (who famously broke down and cried on camera when conceding defeat) by portraying Davenport's deep distress at being deposed as president of his local bowls club. In the early 1980s, Curtis made numerous appearances on the Donnie Sutherland-hosted music programmes Sounds and After Dark. He had a regular segment on Sounds (as Wayne Simpson), called Wayne at Work, and he also made several memorable appearances in character on After Dark, including the humourless Det. Sgt. Frank Masarati of the NSW Police Entertainment Squad (whose job was to carry out \\"random laughter tests\\"), and as Harold Davenport, who appeared in a parody of contemporary pop duo Haysi Fantayzee with his \\"deeply platonic\\" friend Lillian Pascoe (Webber). Excerpts from several of Curtis' appearances on After Dark were compiled as a tribute to him and included in the final episode of the series, which went to air the week after Curtis died.YouTube - After Dark final episode, Part 2 One of Curtis' final screen performances was a minor role as a nosy neighbour in the 1985 movie Rebel, which starred Matt Dillon and Debra Byrne.

He is the son of former South Carolina Congressman Arthur Ravenel Jr. He starred for five seasons on the Bravo reality-television series Southern Charm, was state treasurer for six months, and was an Independent candidate for the United States Senate in the 2014 election in South Carolina. He is also a member of the French Huguenot Church in Charleston. Background Prior to running for office, Ravenel founded the Ravenel Development Corporation, a commercial real estate company. Ravenel ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, seeking the seat left open when Fritz Hollings retired. He came in third in the Republican primary election. After Ravenel endorsed Republican Jim DeMint, DeMint went on to win the Republican runoff and the general election. Subsequently, Ravenel was fined over $19,000 by the Federal Election Commission for improperly filing the required forms for the election.S.C. Politics Today Ravenel ran for South Carolina Treasurer in 2006, defeating nine-term state treasurer Democrat Grady Patterson in the 2006 general election. Ravenel endorsed Ron Paul in the 2012 Republican primaries. Ravenel was previously in the cast of Bravo‚Äôs Southern Charm. Ravenel lives at Brookland Plantation, an estate he purchased in 2006. Education Ravenel graduated from The Citadel in Charleston, receiving his B.S. in 1985. He later received his M.B.A. from the University of South Carolina in 1991. His M.B.A. studies were focused on finance and real estate. Federal drug charges In June 2007, Ravenel was indicted on federal cocaine distribution charges by US Attorney Reginald Lloyd. The filed charges allege that Ravenel purchased less than 500 grams of cocaine through an intermediary in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2005, prior to his election as treasurer but after his abortive entry in the 2004 Senate race. Governor Mark Sanford suspended Ravenel from his duties as state treasurer upon learning of the charges, and appointed Columbia attorney Ken Wingate to replace Ravenel on an interim basis. Meanwhile, Ravenel decided to enter a rehabilitation facility, according to prosecutors. Ravenel had also been volunteering for the Rudolph Giuliani presidential campaign, serving as his South Carolina state chairman. Ravenel resigned from that post after the indictment, according to Giuliani campaign officials. The campaign subsequently replaced Ravenel with Barry Winn, who was co-chair of South Carolina finance committee. On July 24, 2007 Ravenel resigned as Treasurer. The South Carolina General Assembly elected state Rep. Converse Chellis to serve out the remainder of his term. Ravenel underwent a rehabilitation program in Arizona, and then returned to plead guilty to \\"conspiring to buy and distribute less than 100 grams of cocaine\\" in September 2007. =Sentencing= On Friday, March 4, 2008, Thomas Ravenel was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison for drug charges against him, but was not immediately ordered to report to begin his sentence. 2014 campaign for U.S. Senate On Monday, July 14, 2014, Thomas Ravenel submitted more than 17,000 signatures, officially placing him on the ballot as an independent candidate against incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham. He finished in third place, garnering 3.9% of the vote. Personal life Ravenel and his ex-girlfriend, Kathryn Calhoun Dennis, have two children, a girl (Kensington Calhoun) and a boy (Saint Julien Rembert).Southern Charm's Kathryn Dennis Gives Birth to a Baby Boy November 10, 2015 His third child, a son named Jonathan Jackson Ravenel, was born on June 29, 2020 with ex-girlfriend Heather Mascoe. Assault and battery allegations In April 2018, Ashley Perkins, a Florida- based real estate agent, claimed that Ravenel sexually battered her mother, Debbie Holloway Perkins, after meeting him on the dating app Tinder in December 2015. Perkins claims her mother later told her that Ravenel \\"stuck his penis in her face\\" and held her arms back while sticking his fingers inside her vagina and anus. Perkins said she did not witness the battery, but that her mother seemed \\"very withdrawn\\" and finally confided in her. According to Perkins, her mother is unable to publicly discuss the case due to a non- disclosure agreement negotiated by attorney Gloria Allred as part of an alleged $200,000 settlement with Ravenel. However, Perkins, who claims to be a witness to the mediation process between her mother and Ravenel, was not bound to such an agreement and therefore able to publicly disclose the details of the case. Richard P. Terbrusch, Ravenel's attorney, denied Perkins' allegations, stating that his \\"client enjoys a certain degree of fame and unfortunately has become‚Äîunfairly‚Äîa target for an individual who has, in my opinion, dubious motivations.\\" Bravo and Southern Charm production company, Haymaker, announced on May 4, 2018 that it was taking the \\"allegations very seriously\\" and launching its own investigation into their validity. In May 2018, a second accuser‚ÄîDawn Ledwell, former nanny of Ravenel's children‚Äîcame forward (Dawn admitted in court filings Kathryn Dennis pushed Dawn to come forward) with new allegations of sexual battery against Ravenel. \\"Nanny Dawn\\" (as she was known to Southern Charms viewers), and close friend of Kathryn Dennis, claims that in January 2015, Ravenel assaulted her after a night out with his friends: \\"I went upstairs to get my jacket which had the key to my vehicle in the pocket. I was corralled into the master bedroom, and he shut the door behind me. I turned around, and he had his pants dropped, not wearing underwear,\\" she said. \\"He was blocking the door. I was mortified, embarrassed, and scared.\\" Charleston police opened an investigation into the alleged assault after the nanny filed an incident report in early May. Dawn settled the case and completely recanted the details of that evenings events. In September 2018, Ashley Perkins published on her official website that Ledwell had first contacted her that spring, prior to going to the police. At that time, Ledwell shared with Perkins \\"very intimate details of her life and events with Thomas\\". By May, however, Perkins said she had \\"serious doubts\\" about Ledwell's accusations, stating that Ledwell's police report and public accounts of \\"forcible rape\\" differed from what Ledwell had told her privately. As a result, Perkins cut off her relationship with Ledwell, but \\"wished her the best\\". February 2019, Dawn Ledwell amended her original summons and complaint through the courts where the sexual contact is no longer listed. On September 11, 2019, Ravenel pled guilty to third-degree assault and battery in connection with an attack on Ledwell. He will pay a $500 fine, but serve no jail time. He also settled a civil suit with Ledwell, agreeing to donate $80,000 in her name to a charity for sexual assault survivors in lieu of paying her damages.

Early years Perdomo was born June 14, 1919 in El Paso, Texas, one of five siblings born to Mexican immigrants to the United States. His father served in the Mexican Revolution under the command of Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa before emigrating to the United States. Military service Lt. Perdomo poses with his aircraft In February 1943, Perdomo entered an Army Air Forces (AAF) Pilot School in Chandler, Arizona. The AAF schools were civilian flying schools, under government contract, which provided a considerable part of the flying training effort undertaken during World War II by the Army Air Forces. Perdomo received his \\"wings\\" on January 7, 1944. He was then sent to the Army Air Forces Basic Flight School at Chico, California, where he underwent further training as a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt pilot. Upon the completion of his training he was assigned to the 464th Fighter Squadron which was part of the 507th Fighter Group that was sent overseas to the Pacific theater to the Island of Ie Shima off the west coast of Okinawa. The primary mission of the 507th was to provide fighter cover to 8th Air Force Boeing B-29's which were to be stationed on Okinawa.Cavanaugh Flight Museum The 507th began operations on July 1, 1945. Perdomo was assigned P-47N-2-RE number 146 aircraft (serial number 44-88211), maintained by crew chief S/Sgt. F. W. Pozieky. Perdomo nicknamed his airplane Lil Meaties Meat Chopper with the nose art depicting a diapered baby chomping a cigar in his mouth and derby hat on his head, clutching a rifle. The name referred to his first son, Kenneth, then a year and a half old. Perdomo flew his first combat mission on July 2, while escorting a B-29 to Kyushu. =Ace in a Day= A \\"flying ace\\" or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat. The term \\"ace in a day\\" is used to designate a fighter pilot who has shot down five or more airplanes in a single day. Since World War I, a number of pilots have been honored as \\"Ace in a Day\\". The last \\"Ace in a Day\\" for the United States in World War II was 1st Lt. Oscar Francis Perdomo.Definition of \\"Ace\\" P-47 Thunderbolt Perdomo was a first lieutenant and a veteran of ten combat missions when on August 9, 1945 the United States dropped the world's second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. The allies were still awaiting Japan's response to the demand to surrender and the war continued, when on August 13, 1945 1st Lt. Perdomo, shot down four Nakajima \\"Oscar\\" fighters and one Yokosuka \\"Willow\\" Type 93 biplane trainer. While the 507th Fighter Group mission reports confirm his kills as \\"Oscars\\", they were actually Ki-84 \\"Franks\\" from the 22nd and 85th Hiko-Sentais. The combat took place near Keijo / Seoul, Korea when 38 Thunderbolts of the 507th Fighter Wing, USAAF, encountered approximately 50 enemy aircraft. It was Perdomo's last combat mission, and the five confirmed victories made him an \\"Ace in a Day\\" and thus the distinction of being the last \\"Ace\\" of the United States in World War II. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Air Medal with one leaf cluster.P-47N Post-war After the war, Perdomo continued to serve in the Army Air Forces. In 1947, he was reassigned to the newly formed United States Air Force and served until January 1950. When Perdomo returned to civilian life, he joined the Air Force Reserve. On June 30, 1950, Perdomo was recalled to active duty upon the outbreak of the Korean War at the rank of captain. He continued to serve in the Air Force until January 30, 1958 when he left the military at the rank of major.Americas Defense Later years Perdomo was emotionally affected when his son, SPC4 Kris Mitchell Perdomo, was one of 3 men killed on May 5, 1970, aboard a U.S. Army helicopter UH-1 Iroquois which crashed and exploded about 5 miles southwest of the city of Phy Vinh in Vƒ©nh B√¨nh Province, South Vietnam.Helicopter UH-1C 66-15148 He had trouble coping with the situation and developed an addiction to alcohol, which took Major Oscar F.

Milk is sourced from farms as far north as Karamea and as far south as Haast on the West Coast and from farms throughout Canterbury. Their major processing factory is located in Hokitika on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, with their main warehouse and milk concentration plant near Rolleston outside Christchurch. History The Westland Co-operative Dairy Company Limited was formed in 1937 following the amalgamation of a number of small co-operatives within the Westland region including Kokatahi, Waitaha and part of the Arahura Dairy Companies.http://westland.co.nz/celebrate Prior to the restructure of the dairy industry in 2001, dairy products manufactured in New Zealand were marketed and exported by the New Zealand Dairy Board, which was jointly owned by all dairy companies. In 2001, the industry was deregulated and the New Zealand Co-operative Dairy Company Limited, Kiwi Co-operative Dairies Limited and the New Zealand Dairy Board amalgamated to form Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited. Westland Milk Products shareholders elected not to participate in the amalgamation and so became a fully independent dairy company responsible for the sales and marketing of its own products. Westland Milk Products is the third largest independent dairy company in New Zealand and processes approximately three per cent of the country's total milk production. During the 2015-16 financial year, 68 million kilogrammes of milk solids were produced by Westland Milk Products which were marketed and sold throughout the world. In 2004, Westland launched their consumer butter brand Westgold. In 2009 the Rolleston storage and sales and marketing office was established, and the site now also houses a Reverse Osmosis Plant and staff from many different business areas - including Customer Service, IT, Finance, Supply Chain, People and Capability and Milk Collection.

The play is unusual in their canon, in that its opening scene contains material from Ben Jonson's 1629 comedy The New Inn. The problem The common materials are Love's Pilgrimage, Act I, scene i, lines 25-63 and 330-411, and The New Inn, II,v,48-73 and III,i,57-93 and 130-68. Early researchers like F. G. Fleay and Robert Boyle thought that the Jonsonian material in Love's Pilgrimage was authorial -- that Jonson was one of the creators of the play.E. H. C. Oliphant, The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher: An Attempt to Determine Their Respective Shares and the Shares of Others, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927; pp. 432-3. Modern critics favor the view that the common material, original with Jonson, was interpolated into Love's Pilgrimage during a revision, perhaps for a new production in 1635. (The office book of Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, records a payment of ¬£1 received for renewing the license of the play on 16 September 1635.) It is possible that the revision was done by Jonson himself; but far more probably, it was the work of an anonymous reviser.Fredson Bowers, general editor, The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon, Vol. 2. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1970; pp. 569-73, 692-5. The latter interpretation was first advanced by Gerard Langbaine in 1691, who claimed that Jonson's work was \\"stolen\\" for the play. Authorship Apart from the Jonsonian interpolations, the play shows internal evidence of being a fairly typical Beaumont and Fletcher collaboration. Cyrus Hoy, in his survey of authorship questions in the canon of Fletcher and his collaborators, produced this division of shares between the two dramatists: ::Beaumont -- Act I, scene 1; Act IV; Act V; ::Fletcher -- Act I, scene 2; Act II, Act III. The play is thought to have originally been written c. 1615-16,Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 67. and therefore must have been one of the last plays Beaumont worked on before his 1616 death. Its early performance history is unknown; it was acted by the King's Men for King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria at Hampton Court Palace in December 1636. Sources The plot of the play derives from Las dos Doncellas, one of the Novelas ejemplares of Miguel de Cervantes, published in Spain in 1613 and in a French translation in 1615. (Fletcher relied on another of the Novelas for his solo play The Chances.) It is thought that the playwrights depended upon the French translation.Baldwin Maxwell, Studies in Beaumont, Fletcher, and Massinger, Chapel Hill, NC, University of North Carolina Press, 1939; pp. 107-8. Love's Pilgrimage was first published in the Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647.

History The Federal Communications Commission granted Garden Spot Broadcasters, Inc. a construction permit for the station on April 24, 1962 with the WGSA-FM call sign. On November 9, 1962, the station signed on for the first time.Broadcasting Yearbook 1964 page B-131 It was the FM counterpart to AM 1360 WGSA (now off the air). WGSA-AM-FM were both owned by Garden Spot Broadcasters with the two stations simulcasting part of their day. At the time, WGSA-FM was licensed for only 1,580 watts, a fraction of its current effective radiated power (ERP). The station was granted its first license by the FCC on January 23, 1963. On April 4, 1970, Garden Spot Broadcasters was granted a construction permit by the FCC to increase the station's ERP to 50,000 watts while its height above average terrain (HAAT) remained at 500 feet, followed by a new license with the upgraded facilities on October 19, 1970. By 1970, the FM station was running an automated country music format, with the new call sign WIOV, using a mix of western and Roman numerals to represent the dial position at 105 MHz. Over time, disc jockeys were added and the automation was scaled back. In 1984, the FM station was acquired by Brill Media.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-378 Brill moved the studios to 44 Bethany Road. On April 14, 1999, the FCC granted a construction permit to increase the station's HAAT to while decreasing the station's ERP to 25,000 watts. In 2004, Citadel Broadcasting acquired WIOV- FM.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-462 In 2011, the United States Department of Justice approved the purchase of Citadel Broadcasting by Cumulus Media.

On March 2, 2018, Cumulus Media announced that two stations in its Harrisburg cluster, country formatted 106.7 WZCY-FM, would trade places with Top 40/CHR formatted 93.5 WWKL effective March 15. WIOV and WZCY had service contours that overlapped in much of South Central Pennsylvania. The move to the lower- powered Class A station on 93.5 MHz would allow WZCY to continue focusing on covering the Harrisburg market,‚ÄúCumulus Sets Harrisburg Format Swap‚Äù from Radio Insight (March 2, 2018) while WWKL, at 106.7 MHz, would get a Class B signal having a larger service contour, covering Lancaster, York and Lebanon in addition to Harrisburg.

Unlike many of her class, which received only numbers and were disposed of after World War II, she survived long enough to be named. On 1 July 1955, all LSTs still in commission were named for US counties or parishes; LST-1123 was given the name Sedgwick County, after counties in Colorado and Kansas. LST-1123 was laid down on 1 November 1944 at Seneca, Illinois, by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company; launched on 29 January 1945, sponsored by Betty Lou Bailey; and commissioned on 19 February 1945, Lt.

Biography Born in Stamford Hill, north London, Mel Calman was the youngest of the three children of Clement Calman, a timber merchant, and his wife, Anna (both Russian-Jewish immigrants who came to England about 1912). Evacuated to Cambridge to avoid the Blitz in World War II, he was educated at the Perse School. Failing to gain entrance to read English at Cambridge University, he returned to London where he enrolled at the Borough Polytechnic Art School. After two years of national service, he studied illustration at Saint Martin's School of Art, and in 1956 he attempted to find work as a freelance cartoonist. Punch was discouraging about his work, but in 1958 he succeeded in placing work with the \\"William Hickey\\" column in the Daily Express. Although in regular work, he left the Express after five years, seeing no prospects being in competition with Osbert Lancaster and Giles. In 1962 he began producing his trademark \\"little man\\" character for the Sunday Telegraph, and in 1979 he brought this as a regular and long-running contribution to The Times. Additionally, he made contributions to Cosmopolitan and House & Garden, as well as publishing some 20 books of his cartoons. In later life he became an art dealer and collector, in 1989 co-founding the Cartoon Art Trust. In 1994, he died of a coronary thrombosis (heart attack) at the Empire cinema, Leicester Square while watching the film Carlito's Way with writer Deborah Moggach, his partner for the last ten years of his life.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b019rpvp He was married twice, to the magazine designer Pat McNeill and to the artist Karen Elizabeth Usborne.

It was preceded in his list of novels by Mr. Hobbs' Vacation in 1954, and followed by Mr. Robbins Rides Again in 1958. It is a humorous view of a successful businessman's methodical approach to \\"this Christmas business\\", contrasted with his wife's chiding scorn over his \\"typical businessman's approach to something beautiful and intangible\\". The book was published in the fall of 1956 by Harper & Brothers, New York City, and is 181 pages in length in the original edition. The illustrations were by Dorthea Warren Fox. The book is divided into four sections: \\"October\\", \\"November\\", \\"December\\", and \\"Christmas Eve\\", which are further divided by numbered chapters. A Reader's Digest Condensed Books edition was also published in the Fall of 1956, with illustrations by Charles Hawes. Synopsis George Barton Baxter, the successful CEO of a New York textile house is returning to his Park Avenue apartment from work one mid-October evening. His thoughts turn to the onset of cooler weather, which will bring Christmas around once again. He considers the economic impact on his personal finances grimly, and upon arriving home, he takes a short rest before dinner, fantasizing about the type of gifts he would really like, but which he knows are impossible pipe dreams. He also reflects briefly on the gifts he will likely receive - none of which he really needs or will use. At dinner that evening, he discusses a \\"Christmas Budget\\" with his wife, who considers the idea ridiculous - but Mr. Baxter persists. They do mutually decide that their Christmas card list can be cut severely, saving some money there. After deletions and then \\"necessary\\" additions, it has expanded by more than 30 names. Purchasing their Christmas cards also turns out to be a much more expensive proposition than planned. This pattern continues throughout the approaching weeks to the Christmas season, and the general circumstances of the impending holiday seem to dog Mr. Baxter's thrifty soul at every turn. Complicating the situation is the heart's desire of his own wife: A mink stole, an idea he rejects outright, though he knows even then, subconsciously, that is exactly what he will eventually buy for her. A disastrous attempted lunchtime shopping trip for a minor gift, the exhausting round of pre- Christmas office parties, and the \\"invisible hands\\" of the many service people in his everyday world being extended for a Christmas gratuity all combine to increase his feeling of helplessness in the face of the Christmas juggernaut. But the \\"season-proof\\" common sense of his secretary Miss Gillyard, and especially his impulsive gesture in inviting a lower-ranking office member out for a drink on Christmas Eve afternoon begin to kindle a faint glow of Christmas spirit within him, culminating in a hilarious attempt at buying a final gift for his wife in Saks Fifth Avenue later that day. Arriving home at last, Mr. Baxter relaxes after dinner in the living room, admiring the tree and the pile of gifts beneath, which he fully realizes is largely his wife's work. As they prepare to leave the living room for bed, they enter a poignant dialog about the impact and meaning of Christmas, culminating with his wife telling him affectionately: \\"You love it - you love every bit of it!\\" to which Mr. Baxter does not disagree, as his wife bids him goodnight with \\"Merry Christmas, Mr. Baxter\\". Background Streeter was a long-time resident of New York City, and had just retired as a Vice-President of The Bank of New York at the time he wrote this novel. His descriptions of mid-20th century New York are insightful, and filled with a combination of equal parts cynicism, dry wit and affection, as was his typical writing style. Television adaptation The story was dramatized as an episode of the NBC anthology series The Alcoa Hour on December 2, 1956. Dennis King starred as Mr. Baxter, with Patricia Benoit as his wife and Margaret Hamilton as Miss Gillyard.

The land was owned by Micheal Canton prior to the war and returned to him afterward. The fort was a hexagon with sides; inside was a flag pole, deep well, officer quarters, and barracks, while outside was a guard house. The fort was an artillery installation defending the eastern approaches of Washington. During the war the following pieces were at the fort: * 3 - 8 inch howitzers (en embrasure) * 3 - 24 pounder seacoast guns (en barbette) * 2 - 6 pounder field guns * 1 - 24 pounder Coehorn mortar. Fort Dupont never fired guns in hostile action; however, after the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, according to John Longyear, \\"the Chain of forts around the city and the batteries of field artillery between, made a ring of cannons around the city which were fired for several hours.

The following year it was used in the revue Words and Music and also released in a \\"studio version\\". It then became a signature feature in Coward's cabaret act. The song's title refers to its refrain, \\"Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun.\\" The song begins with the first 10 notes of \\"Rule Britannia\\". This song is considered a patter song, because the lyrics are mostly spoken rather than sung. One of the memorable lines in the first chorus is \\"But Englishmen detest a siesta\\". According to Sheridan Morley, Coward wrote the song while driving from Hanoi to Saigon \\"without pen, paper, or piano\\". Coward himself elucidated: \\"I wrestled in my mind with the complicated rhythms and rhymes of the song until finally it was complete, without even the aid of pencil and paper. I sang it triumphantly and unaccompanied to my travelling companion on the verandah of a small jungle guest house. Not only Jeffrey [Amherst], but the gecko lizards and the tree frogs gave every vocal indication of enthusiasm\\".Coward, No√´l, The Complete Illustrated Lyrics 1st edition (1998), Overlook Hardcover, The Noonday Gun The lines :In Hong Kong, they strike a gong, and fire off a noonday gun :To reprimand each inmate who's in late refer to the Noonday Gun opposite the Excelsior Hotel in Hong Kong, which is still fired every day at noon by a member of Jardines. In 1968, Coward visited Hong Kong and fired the gun. Churchill and Roosevelt Coward wrote, \\"In Words and Music Romney Brent sang it as a missionary in one of Britain's tropical colonies. Since then I have sung it myself ad nauseam. On one occasion it achieved international significance. This was a dinner party given by Mr Winston Churchill on board HMS Prince of Wales in honour of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the evening following the signing of the Atlantic Charter. From an eye-witness description of the scene it appears that the two world leaders became involved in a heated argument as to whether 'In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run' came at the end of the first refrain or at the end of the second. President Roosevelt held firmly to the latter view and refused to budge even under the impact of Churchillian rhetoric. In this he was right and when, a little later, I asked Mr Churchill about the incident, he admitted defeat like a man.\\"Coward, No√´l.

Monroe, Alexander Grailhe, and Lucius W. Place. Monroe, the nominee of the Native American Party, represented the current administration. Grailhe, an independent, was essentially the anti- administration candidate, who he held responsible for the poor condition of the city. The newspapers of the time were filled with complaints about the stagnant gutters, the weeds that grew along the streets, and the air of general neglect. However, Monroe was elected with 37,027 votes. Grailhe received a much smaller number, and Place hardly any. =Federal capture of New Orleans= There is a story about the Civil War that the white leadership of New Orleans was captured, but never surrendered. :This is a letter written by William Preston Johnston: \\"The capture of New Orleans in April 1862 by Captain David Farragut and General Benjamin Butler brought the name of mayor Monroe before the whole country and the people of the then confederate States and the United States. It soon spread to British journalism and into British Parliament. \\"At the approach of the federal fleet, on the morning of April 25, Mayor Monroe, determined to hoist the flag of the State of Louisiana over the City Hall. At his request, his private secretary, Mr. Marion A. Baker, descended to the roof of the building and prepared to execute the mayor‚Äôs orders, with the instructions to await the issue of the possible conflict at Chalmette. \\"When he heard that the defenses had failed Monroe ordered the flag hoisted. \\"Forthwith, two officers of the United States Navy presented Farragut's formal demand for the city's surrender and to lower their flag. Monroe stated that be had no authority to surrender the city and that General Mansfield Lovell was the proper official to receive and to reply to that demand. He refused to lower the flag. \\"Monroe then sent for Lovell and while awaiting his arrival, conversation went on. Captain Bailey expressed regret at the wanton destruction of property, which he had witnessed and which he regarded as a most unfortunate mistake. To this, Monroe replied that the property was the Confederates' own and that they had a right to do as they pleased with it, and that it was done as a patriotic duty. \\"Subsequently, Lovell also refused to surrender the city or his forces and stated that he would retire with his troops and leave the decision to the civil authorities. The question of surrender being thus referred back to him, Monroe said he would submit the matter to the Council and that a formal reply would be sent as soon as their advice could be obtained. The Federal officers then withdrew, with an escort furnished by Lovell. \\"Monroe sent a message to the Council who met at 6:30 that evening. As civil magistrate, he held that he was incompetent to the performance of a military act. 'We yield to physical force alone,' said the Mayor, 'and maintain our allegiance to the Government of the Confederate States. Beyond a due respect for our dignity, our rights and the flag of our country, does not, I think permit us to go.' \\"The Council, unwilling to act hastily, simply listened to the reading of this message and adjourned until 10:00 A. M. the next day. That evening, Monroe asked Baker and Police Chief McClelland, to go to the as early as possible the next morning and explain to Farragut that the Council would meet that morning and a written answer to his demand would be sent as soon as possible after the meeting. \\"The Council met and listened to a second reading of the Mayor's message. Both the Council and the population of the city concurred in the sentiments expressed by Monroe and urged that he be act in the spirit manifested in his message. Anticipating such a result, a letter had already been prepared, reiterating the determination neither to lower the State flag nor to raise the United States flag. The Mayor‚Äôs secretary read this letter to the assembled Council and from expressions by some of the members, it seemed to be satisfactory, but shortly after Mr. Baker left, a message was brought to Mayor Monroe, asking his presence in the Council Chamber. \\"The object of this summons was to obtain his consent to the substitution of a letter written by Soul√© and read by one of the members of the Council. Relations between the Mayor and the Council had not been of a most harmonious character and wishing to conciliate them at this unfortunate time, Monroe acceded to their wishes. \\"Before a copy of this letter could be made and sent to Farragut, two officers, Lieutenant Albert Kautz and Midshipman John H. Read were at the City Hall with a written demand for the 'unqualified surrender of the city, and the raising of the United States flag over the Mint, Custom-house and City Hall, by noon that day, Saturday, April 26 and the removal of all other emblems but that of the United States, from all public buildings.' Monroe acknowledged receipt of this last communication and promised a reply before two o'clock, if possible. In the meantime a large and excited crowd had gathered outside the City Hall. Monroe, fearing for the safety of the two Federal officers, had had the heavy doors of the City Hall closed and ordered a carriage to be stationed at the corner of Carondelet and Lafayette streets. Escorted by two special officers and Baker, the federal officers were conducted to a rear entrance and to the waiting carriage, while Monroe occupied the crowd in the front. As the carriage drove away, some of the crowd started up St. Charles street with the expectation of heading it off. The driver was ordered to whip up his horses and to turn into Julia street and then drive posthaste to the river. The pursuers were armed, but the carriage went by so rapidly that they had no opportunity to fire and the party reached their ship without violence. \\"The police force being inadequate for the preservation of order, Monroe called upon the European Brigade for assistance. This organization was made up of foreign residents and commanded by General Paul Juge Jr. Juge then issued a proclamation, by order of the mayor. asking for the aid of all good citizens in the preservation of order. The mayor was thus constituted commander-in-chief of army and of the civic forces. The City Hall became sort of military headquarters. Requisitions were issued for arms, horses, provisions for the home brigade and orders for transportation for Confederate troops en route from outlying fortifications to Lovell‚Äôs headquarters at Camp Moore. Martial law reigned, and Monroe improvised a military court, Soul√© being appointed Advocate. \\"A communication received from Farragut, on Monday, stated that due to evidences of insubordination on the part of citizens and authorities, the fire of the fleet might be drawn on the city at any moment. 'The election is with you,' said Farragut, 'and it is my duty to notify you to remove the women and children within forty-eight hours, if I have rightly understood your determination.' Reading the message, Mr. Monroe said: 'As I consider this a threat to bombard the city, and as it is a matter about which the notice should be clear and specific, I desire to know when the forty-eight hours began to run.' \\"'It begins from the time you receive this notice,' Captain Bell replied. \\"The mayor, looking at his watch, noted 'You see it is fifteen minutes past twelve,' and renewed his refusal to lower the flag of Louisiana. 'This satisfaction,' he said, 'you cannot obtain from our hands. We will stand your bombardment, unarmed, undefended, as we are.' \\"The forts surrendered and on April 29, 1862, Farragut dispatched a message in forming Monroe of his intention to take formal possession of the city and that he was about to raise the United States flag over the mint, customhouse and still insisted that the lowering of the flag over the City Hall should be the work of those who had raised it. \\"Monroe at once issued a proclamation asking all citizens to retire to their homes during acts of authority which would be folly to resist and impressed upon them the consolation that the flag was not to be removed by their authority, but by those who had the power to exercise it. \\"Farragut sent a detachment of sailors and marines ashore. Protected by two howitzers, the landing party, raised the flag over the customhouse, proceeded to Lafayette Square and the City Hall. The marines formed a line on the St. Charles street side of the Square near the railing then enclosing it, while the guns were drawn through the gates, into the middle of the street and placed so as to command the street either way. \\"The silent, angry crowd formed a compact mass both above and below the Square, many openly displaying arms. The Federal forces being stationed, Bell and Lieutenant Kautz entered the City Hall and the Mayor's office. Bell told Monroe: 'I have come in obedience to orders to haul down the State flag from this building,' Monroe replied: 'Very well, Sir, you can do it; but I wish to say that there is not in my entire constituency, so wretched a renegade as would be willing to exchange places with you.' Bell then asked that he might be shown to the roof. Monroe referred him to the janitor whom he would find outside. \\"Fearing that some excited person in the crowd might commit some rash action and thereby bring disaster to the many assembled, the Mayor placed himself in front of the cannon pointing down St. Charles Street. Folding his arms, he fixed his eyes upon the gunner who stood, lanyard in hand, ready for action. There the Mayor remained, without once looking up or moving, until Kautz cut the halyards with his sword pulled down the flag and he and Bell reappeared. At an order from the Federal officers, the sailors and marines retired as they had come. \\"The following day, Captain Farragut informed Mr. Monroe that there would be no further negotiations between them as General Benjamin Butler had arrived and would take charge. That same afternoon, two companies of Federal troops were placed around the City Hall and sentries posted at the doors. One of Butler's officers went in to invite Mayor Monroe to come to headquarters. Mr. Monroe, as usual, maintaining his dignity, refused to go to the St. Charles Hotel, except as a prisoner, insisting that the City Hall was the proper place to transact city business but up on advice from the City Council, be decided to yield and taking the Chief of Police with him, went to the Hotel. General Butler told Mayor Monroe he had come to restore the state and city to the Union and asked his co-operation in the management of the city, but the Mayor was not in a co- operative mood, and was giving as he had written to Farragut, only that submission which the conqueror is able to extort from the conquered. He replied that be must be allowed to administer the city alone or give it up entirely. \\"A conference was arranged in which the Mayor, the Council and Mr, Soul√© met with General Butler and his staff. General Butler then read his first proclamation as commander of New Orleans. \\"On May 16, 1862, Butler issued his infamous Order No. 28. As soon as it appeared, Monroe protested to Butler in an impassioned letter. 'I had not anticipated,' he wrote, 'a war against women and children, whose only offense had been to show displeasure at the occupation of an enemy. And to give license to your officers and soldiers to commit outrages such as are indicated in your order, is in my judgment a reproach to the civilization, not to say the Christianity of the age in whose name I make this protest.' \\"Summoned before Butler, the mayor was told that the language of his letter could not be tolerated and if peace in the city could not be restored by him, he would be imprisoned in Fort Jackson. Monroe replied his wish was to vindicate the honor of the virtuous women of the city. Butler stated that the order was not directed at such persons. Satisfied with this explanation, Monroe signed an apology for his letter, but the next day appeared at Butler's office to withdraw his apology. Again, apparently satisfied by Butler's promise to publish the letter and apology with a statement from Butler that the order applied only to ladies who offered insult, Monroe left. Shortly after, Monroe asked for a second time to withdraw the apology and sent another letter similar to the first one. Butler then called the mayor and several others to his office and ordered the mayor, his secretary, the Chief of Police and Judge Kennedy to be sent to Fort St. Philip. Monroe was later sent to Fort Pickens.\\" Suspended from office Upon Monroe's imprisonment, Butler appointed Brigadier General George F. Shepley, Military Commandant of New Orleans. Refusing to take the oath of allegiance, Monroe was at one time consigned to solitary confinement and was for six months made to wear the ball and chain. While he was at Fort St. Philip, his young son fell terminally ill. Mrs. Monroe applied to Butler for the release of her husband, in order that he could be at the bedside of his dying child. Butler sent word that if Monroe would take the oath of allegiance he might come to the city and see his child, but the offer was declined and the child died without him. The following year, Monroe was released. He went to Mobile and then to Richmond, where he was received by President Davis. Later he fixed his residence in Mobile, where he was taken prisoner by General Edward Canby. After the close of the war Monroe was arrested a third time, with no reason given by the Provost Marshal for his extraordinary proceeding and kept under surveillance for several months. =Second term= After the reorganization of Louisiana, Monroe was reelected Mayor of New Orleans. He took office in March 1866. In March 1867, he was deposed by General Philip Sheridan under the Reconstruction Act of Congress, under the accusation that he had aided in the riot of July 30. In April Monroe visited Washington and was sympathetically received by President Andrew Johnson and Attorney-General Henry Stanbery, who promised his restoration to office and the removal of Sheridan. However, this promise was thwarted by later and more vigorous Reconstruction efforts. Retirement Monroe moved to Savannah, where he died on February 24, 1871, at the age of 48. He had been a 33rd degree Mason, and was buried in Savannah with Masonic honors. In 1872 his remains were brought to New Orleans, where they were placed in the family tomb in the Cypress Grove Cemetery, beside the body of his favorite son. Personal life Monroe was married to Rebecca Isadora Shepard (born 1826 in New Orleans); they had 9 children.

It was located in the province of Matagalpa, Nicaragua and attended personally by its owners. The resort's fame spread, and many local and international tourists visited it for vacationing and ecotourism. It was confiscated by the Sandinista government and closed in 1983. History Leopoldo Salazar Amador acquired the Santa Mar√≠a de Ostuma property in the 1920s, growing coffee there even as Augusto C√©sar Sandino's guerrilla bands raided through the area. In 1933, the Potter family opened the Mountain Hotel of Aranjuez nearby. (It was converted into a sanitarium in 1950.) Leo Salazar built his own Mountain Hotel (') in 1936. \\"Jolly, round-faced\\" Leo and his wife, Esmeralda \\"Meyaya\\" Arg√ºello, personally attended to guests. The \\"cloud-capped\\" resort was regarded as \\"one of the most picturesque areas of the country.\\" Different attractions drew a diversity of guests. \\"This may be the only place on our continent where, in one day, you can shoot a wild boar, land a 20-pound lake trout, unearth a priceless pre-Christian ceramic and watch the brilliantly plumed quetzals mate,\\" one observer wrote. Some visitors were naturalists, interested in the flora and fauna of the region. Ornithologists came to study birds in the region's habitat, others came to observe rodents or catalog orchids. Hunting and fishing was a draw for some guests. The resort also became known as a honeymoon destination for newlyweds. Bianca Jagger would reminisce that vacations with her mother in the Santa Mar√≠a de Ostuma region were among her \\"happiest memories.\\" In 1975‚Äì76, the Selva Negra Mountain Resort opened a few miles away to the east, also servicing tourists attracted to the beauty of the nearby mountains. In 1978, while the Sandinista rebellion waxed stronger, the Salazars' son Jorge Salazar Arg√ºello moved back to Santa Mar√≠a de Ostuma and set about to revitalize the farm. An altercation with guerrillas camped on the property stoked Leo's fears that the rebels would take revenge for his National Guard service in the 1930s during the time when the US Marines created and commanded the Guard, and he went into exile in February 1979. However, Jorge and his family sympathized with the rebel cause, and fed the guerrillas.Christian, 201. During the Somoza regime's collapse, Jorge began organizing fellow coffee farmers in the region into a cooperative, which provided him with an initial political base as he increasingly protested against the policies of the new Sandinista government. He was killed in November 1980. As with many Sandinista-confiscated properties, Santa Mar√≠a de Ostuma was the scene of turmoil in the years after Violeta Chamorro defeated them in 1990 elections. According to Jorge Salazar's daughter Luc√≠a, although the land was officially returned to the family, Sandinista general Joaqu√≠n Cuadra ,who had misappropriated various farms in the area that had been arbitrarily confiscated by the Sandinistas, turned it over only reluctantly, there were incursions by machete-armed men, and vandalism had ruined the property. The Sandinista Agricultural Workers' Association, on the other hand, complained to the International Labour Organization that four union members had been arrested by the police at the ranch, arrests the government denied had taken place. Land disputes created by the confiscation continue into 2007. The hotel has not been rebuilt. In post-Sandinista governments, Jorge Salazar's son Jorge Salazar Cardenal would be appointed Minister of the Environment and Natural Resources, and his daughter Luc√≠a Salazar de Robelo would serve as Minister of Tourism.

She got underway for Key West, Florida, 13 October, assigned to Commander Gulf Sea Frontier at Naval Operating Base Key West, Florida. During the next six months, she was assigned as a convoy escort from Key West making countless voyages along the Gulf Coast with merchant ships and naval auxiliaries. She was sometimes diverted on escort voyages to Havana and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and frequently called at the Florida ports of Miami and Port Everglades. She departed Key West for the last time 16 April 1944 and joined a convoy at Havana for escort to Norfolk.

Medic was one of five Jubilee Class ocean liners (the others being the , , and ) built specifically to service the Liverpool-Cape Town-Sydney route. The ship's name pertained to the ancient Persian region of Media and was pronounced Meedick. Medic was the second Jubilee Class ship to be built for the Australia service. Like her sisters she was a single funnel liner, measuring just under 12,000 gross tons, which had capacity for 320 passengers in third-class on three decks, she also had substantial cargo capacity with seven cargo holds, most of them refrigerated for the transport of Australian meat. After a long career with White Star, Medic was sold in 1928 and was converted into a whaling factory ship and renamed Hektoria, she remained in service in this role until being torpedoed and sunk in the Atlantic whilst sailing in a convoy in 1942. White Star Line career Medic was launched at Belfast on 15 December 1898, but her completion was delayed until 6 July the following year, so that improvements that were being made to her earlier sister could be incorporated into her construction. Medic inaugurated White Star's new Australia service with her maiden voyage, which started from Liverpool on 3 August 1899, she was then the largest ship ever to sail to Australia. Although Afric was the first ship built for the service, she did not make her first voyage to Australia until the following month. On board the maiden voyage was Charles Lightoller on his first assignment as Fourth Mate, he would later become the only senior officer to survive the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Upon Medics arrival in Australia she was greeted with a rapturous reception. Lightoller wrote: :\\"She was a show ship, the biggest that had ever been out there, and the people in Australia gave us the time of our lives. Everything and everywhere it was Medic\\" On her first return trip to the UK, Medic carried Australian troops to South Africa for the Boer War which had started in October 1899, and continued to carry troops to the conflict until it concluded in 1902. In October 1900, while Medic was anchored in Neutral Bay, Sydney Harbour, Charles Lightoller and some shipmates were involved in the \\"Fort Denison Incident\\", a prank intended to fool locals into believing a Boer raiding party was attacking the city. The culprits were never apprehended but Lightoller confessed to his company's superiors, after which he was transferred to the Atlantic route. Medic leaving Sydney, in the 1900s On 15 June 1907 Medic collided with the 4,134-ton petroleum tank steamer Turbo in fog in the English Channel off the Kent coast while sailing from London to Liverpool. The Turbo was seriously damaged and had to be towed to harbour: The damage to Medic at first appeared to only consist of a crack above the waterline, and so she continued her voyage to Liverpool where she was dry docked for a more thorough examination of the damage: Here it was discovered that Medic had a hole below the waterline; several lumber plates having been loosened and displaced. Medic initially continued on her scheduled commercial service following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, because of her large refrigerated meat carrying capacity, however she also carried Australian troops to Britain, as such she gained the designation HMAT (His Majesty's Australian Transport) A7. In November 1914 John Simpson Kirkpatrick departed Australia on board Medic, he would later become famous for his role as a stretcher bearer during the Gallipoli Campaign. In May 1915 Medic was refitted at Sydney to carry 531 troops and 500 horses, to make her better suited to her wartime role. Medic was later commandeered under the British Liner Requisition Scheme in October 1917, and was used as a troopship, until being released from government service in March 1919, after which she returned to the Australian service. In 1920 Medic underwent a refit where her passenger accommodation was modernised and reconfigured to carry 260 passengers in Second class. She continued in service on the Australian route for most of the 1920s, in consort with the Persic, Runic and Suevic. She made her last voyage for White Star on this route in December 1927; following her return she was laid up for disposal after 28 years of service. Hektoria In June 1928 Medic was sold for ¬£35,000 to A/S Hektor (N. Bugge) of T√∏nsberg, Norway, who converted her into a whale factory ship and renamed her Hektoria (thus she became SS Hektoria). The conversion was carried out by Grayson Rollo and Clover Docks at Birkenhead, and involved the installation of a stern ramp, whereby whale carcasses could be hauled onto deck, the fitting of eighteen large cargo tanks which could hold 8,000 tons of whale oil, and the enlargement of her coal bunkers. Altogether the refit increased the gross tonnage of the ship to 13,834. Hektoria was ready for service for the 1928/29 whaling season off South Georgia. On 22 September 1928 the members of the Wilkins-Hearst Antarctic Expedition boarded Hektoria at New York, they would live on board the ship for the next five months. The aim of the expedition was to explore Antarctica from the air for the first ever time, and two aircraft were carried on board the ship for this purpose. Several exploratory flights were made over the Antarctic Peninsula. The Hektoria Glacier in the Antarctic was named after the ship by the expedition. Hektoria In 1932 Hektoria returned to the British register after her ownership was transferred to Hektor Whaling Ltd of London, but remained involved in the same trade as before. On the outbreak of World War II, Hektoria was requisitioned by the Ministry of War Transport for use as an oil tanker. She finally met her end on 12 September 1942 while sailing in the Atlantic convoy ON 127, when she was hit and damaged by two torpedoes fired by the German U-boat . After the crew abandoned ship she was torpedoed again and sunk by the U-boat at the position (). One crewman lost his life, but the remaining 85 crew members survived and were picked up by the Canadian corvette, and landed at St. John's, Newfoundland. Thus ending the ship's career which had spanned a total of 43 years.

A global schedule is the unified schedule of all the individual database (and other transactional object) schedules in a multidatabase environment (e.g., federated database). Complying with global serializability means that the global schedule is serializable, has the serializability property, while each component database (module) has a serializable schedule as well. In other words, a collection of serializable components provides overall system serializability, which is usually incorrect. A need in correctness across databases in multidatabase systems makes global serializability a major goal for global concurrency control (or modular concurrency control). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, and small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), as well as increase in systems management sophistication, the need for atomic distributed transactions and thus effective global serializability techniques, to ensure correctness in and among distributed transactional applications, seems to increase. In a federated database system or any other more loosely defined multidatabase system, which are typically distributed in a communication network, transactions span multiple (and possibly distributed) databases. Enforcing global serializability in such system, where different databases may use different types of concurrency control, is problematic. Even if every local schedule of a single database is serializable, the global schedule of a whole system is not necessarily serializable. The massive communication exchanges of conflict information needed between databases to reach conflict serializability globally would lead to unacceptable performance, primarily due to computer and communication latency. Achieving global serializability effectively over different types of concurrency control has been open for several years. Commitment ordering (or Commit ordering; CO), a serializability technique publicly introduced in 1991 by Yoav Raz from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), provides an effective general solution for global (conflict) serializability across any collection of database systems and other transactional objects, with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. CO does not need the distribution of conflict information, but rather utilizes the already needed (unmodified) atomic commitment protocol messages without any further communication between databases. It also allows optimistic (non-blocking) implementations. CO generalizes strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL), which in conjunction with the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol is the de facto standard for achieving global serializability across (SS2PL based) database systems. As a result, CO compliant database systems (with any, different concurrency control types) can transparently join existing SS2PL based solutions for global serializability. The same applies also to all other multiple (transactional) object systems that use atomic transactions and need global serializability for correctness (see examples above; nowadays such need is not smaller than with database systems, the origin of atomic transactions). The most significant aspects of CO that make it a uniquely effective general solution for global serializability are the following: #Seamless, low overhead integration with any concurrency control mechanism, with neither changing any transaction's operation scheduling or blocking it, nor adding any new operation. #Heterogeneity: Global serializability is achieved across multiple transactional objects (e.g., database management systems) with different (any) concurrency control mechanisms, without interfering with the mechanisms' operations. #Modularity: Transactional objects can be added and removed transparently. #Autonomy of transactional objects: No need of conflict or equivalent information distribution (e.g., local precedence relations, locks, timestamps, or tickets; no object needs other object's information). #Scalability: With \\"normal\\" global transactions, computer network size and number of transactional objects can increase unboundedly with no impact on performance, and #Automatic global deadlock resolution. All these aspects, except the first two, are also possessed by the popular SS2PL, which is a (constrained, blocking) special case of CO and inherits many of CO's qualities. The global serializability problem =Problem statement= The difficulties described above translate into the following problem: :Find an efficient (high-performance and fault tolerant) method to enforce Global serializability (global conflict serializability) in a heterogeneous distributed environment of multiple autonomous database systems. The database systems may employ different concurrency control methods. No limitation should be imposed on the operations of either local transactions (confined to a single database system) or global transactions (span two or more database systems). =Quotations= Lack of an appropriate solution for the global serializability problem has driven researchers to look for alternatives to serializability as a correctness criterion in a multidatabase environment (e.g., see Relaxing global serializability below), and the problem has been characterized as difficult and open. The following two quotations demonstrate the mindset about it by the end of the year 1991, with similar quotations in numerous other articles: *\\"Without knowledge about local as well as global transactions, it is highly unlikely that efficient global concurrency control can be provided... Additional complications occur when different component DBMSs [Database Management Systems] and the FDBMSs [Federated Database Management Systems] support different concurrency mechanisms... It is unlikely that a theoretically elegant solution that provides conflict serializability without sacrificing performance (i.e., concurrency and/or response time) and availability exists.\\"Amit Sheth, James Larson (1990): \\"Federated Database Systems for Managing Distributed, Heterogeneous, and Autonomous Databases\\" , ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 22, No 3, pp. 183-236, September 1990 (quotation from page 227) Commitment ordering, publicly introduced in May 1991 (see below), provides an efficient elegant general solution, from both practical and theoretical points of view, to the global serializability problem across database systems with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. It provides conflict serializability with no negative effect on availability, and with no worse performance than the de facto standard for global serializability, CO's special case strong strict two-phase locking (SS2PL). It requires knowledge about neither local nor global transactions. *\\"Transaction management in a heterogeneous, distributed database system is a difficult issue. The main problem is that each of the local database management systems may be using a different type of concurrency control scheme. Integrating this is a challenging problem, made worse if we wish to preserve the local autonomy of each of the local databases, and allow local and global transactions to execute in parallel. One simple solution is to restrict global transactions to retrieve-only access. However, the issue of reliable transaction management in the general case, where global and local transactions are allowed to both read and write data, is still open.\\"Abraham Silberschatz, Michael Stonebraker, and Jeffrey Ullman (1991): \\"Database Systems: Achievements and Opportunities\\" , Communications of the ACM, Vol. 34, No. 10, pp. 110-120, October 1991 (quotation from page 120) The commitment ordering solution comprises effective integration of autonomous database management systems with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. This while local and global transactions execute in parallel without restricting any read or write operation in either local or global transactions, and without compromising the systems' autonomy. Even in later years, after the public introduction of the Commitment ordering general solution in 1991, the problem still has been considered by many unsolvable: *\\"We present a transaction model for multidatabase systems with autonomous component systems, coined heterogeneous 3-level transactions. It has become evident that in such a system the requirements of guaranteeing full ACID properties and full local autonomy can not be reconciled...\\"Peter Muth (1997): \\"Application Specific Transaction Management in Multidatabase Systems\\", Distributed and Parallel Databases, Volume 5, Issue 4, pp. 357 - 403, October 1997, (quotation from the article's Abstract) The quotation above is from a 1997 article proposing a relaxed global serializability solution (see Relaxing global serializability below), and referencing Commitment ordering (CO) articles. The CO solution supports effectively both full ACID properties and full local autonomy, as well as meeting the other requirements posed above in the Problem statement section, and apparently has been misunderstood. Similar thinking we see also in the following quotation from a 1998 article: *\\"The concept of serializability has been the traditionally accepted correctness criterion in database systems. However in multidatabase systems (MDBSs), ensuring global serializability is a difficult task. The difficulty arises due to the heterogeneity of the concurrency control protocols used by the participating local database management systems (DBMSs), and the desire to preserve the autonomy of the local DBMSs. In general, solutions to the global serializability problem result in executions with a low degree of concurrency. The alternative, relaxed serializability, may result in data inconsistency.\\"Sharad Mehrotra, Rajeev Rastogi, Henry Korth, Abraham Silberschatz (1998): \\"Ensuring Consistency in Multidatabases by Preserving Two-Level Serializability\\", ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS), Vol. 23, No. 2, pp. 199-230, June 1998 (quotation from the article's Abstract) Also the above quoted article proposes a relaxed global serializability solution, while referencing the CO work. The CO solution for global serializability both bridges between different concurrency control protocols with no substantial concurrency reduction (and typically minor, if at all), and maintains the autonomy of local DBMSs. Evidently also here CO has been misunderstood. This misunderstanding continues to 2010 in a textbook by some of the same authors, where the same relaxed global serializability technique, Two level serializability, is emphasized and described in detail, and CO is not mentioned at all.Avi Silberschatz, Henry F Korth, S. Sudarshan (2010): Database System Concepts, 6th Edition, McGraw-Hill, On the other hand, the following quotation on CO appears in a 2009 book:Philip A. Bernstein, Eric Newcomer (2009): Principles of Transaction Processing, 2nd Edition , Morgan Kaufmann (Elsevier), June 2009, (quotation from page 145) *\\"Not all concurrency control algorithms use locks... Three other techniques are timestamp ordering, serialization graph testing, and commit ordering. Timestamp ordering assigns each transaction a timestamp and ensures that conflicting operations execute in timestamp order. Serialization graph testing tracks conflicts and ensures that the serialization graph is acyclic. Commit ordering ensures that conflicting operations are consistent with the relative order in which their transactions commit, which can enable interoperability of systems using different concurrency control mechanisms.\\" :Comments: #Beyond the common locking based algorithm SS2PL, which is a CO variant itself, also additional variants of CO that use locks exist, (see below). However, generic, or \\"pure\\" CO does not use locks. #Since CO mechanisms order the commit events according to conflicts that already have occurred, it is better to describe CO as \\"Commit ordering ensures that the relative order in which transactions commit is consistent with the order of their respective conflicting operations.\\" The characteristics and properties of the CO solution are discussed below. =Proposed solutions= Several solutions, some partial, have been proposed for the global serializability problem. Among them: * Global conflict graph (serializability graph, precedence graph) checking * Distributed Two phase locking (Distributed 2PL) * Distributed Timestamp ordering * Tickets (local logical timestamps which define local total orders, and are propagated to determine global partial order of transactions) * Commitment ordering =Technology perspective= The problem of global serializability has been a quite intensively researched subject in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Commitment ordering (CO) has provided an effective general solution to the problem, insight into it, and understanding about possible generalizations of strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL), which practically and almost exclusively has been utilized (in conjunction with the Two-phase commit protocol (2PC) ) since the 1980s to achieve global serializability across databases. An important side-benefit of CO is the automatic global deadlock resolution that it provides (this is applicable also to distributed SS2PL; though global deadlocks have been an important research subject for SS2PL, automatic resolution has been overlooked, except in the CO articles, until today (2009)). At that time quite many commercial database system types existed, many non-relational, and databases were relatively very small. Multi database systems were considered a key for database scalability by database systems interoperability, and global serializability was urgently needed. Since then the tremendous progress in computing power, storage, and communication networks, resulted in orders of magnitude increases in both centralized databases' sizes, transaction rates, and remote access to database capabilities, as well as blurring the boundaries between centralized computing and distributed one over fast, low-latency local networks (e.g., Infiniband). These, together with progress in database vendors' distributed solutions (primarily the popular SS2PL with 2PC based, a de facto standard that allows interoperability among different vendors' (SS2PL-based) databases; both SS2PL and 2PC technologies have gained substantial expertise and efficiency), workflow management systems, and database replication technology, in most cases have provided satisfactory and sometimes better information technology solutions without multi database atomic distributed transactions over databases with different concurrency control (bypassing the problem above). As a result, the sense of urgency that existed with the problem at that period, and in general with high-performance distributed atomic transactions over databases with different concurrency control types, has reduced. However, the need in concurrent distributed atomic transactions as a fundamental element of reliability exists in distributed systems also beyond database systems, and so the need in global serializability as a fundamental correctness criterion for such transactional systems (see also Distributed serializability in Serializability). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), and sophisticated systems management the need for effective global serializability techniques to ensure correctness in and among distributed transactional applications seems to increase, and thus also the need in Commitment ordering (including the popular for databases special case SS2PL; SS2PL, though, does not meet the requirements of many other transactional objects). The commitment ordering solution Commitment orderingYoav Raz (1992): \\"The Principle of Commitment Ordering, or Guaranteeing Serializability in a Heterogeneous Environment of Multiple Autonomous Resource Managers Using Atomic Commitment\\" , Proc. of the Eighteenth Int. Conf. on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB), pp. 292-312, Vancouver, Canada, August 1992. (also DEC-TR 841, Digital Equipment Corporation, November 1990) Yoav Raz (1994): \\"Serializability by Commitment Ordering\\", Information Processing Letters, Volume 51, Number 5, pp. 257-264, September 1994. (Received August 1991) (or Commit ordering; CO) is the only high-performance, fault tolerant, conflict serializability providing solution that has been proposed as a fully distributed (no central computing component or data- structure are needed), general mechanism that can be combined seamlessly with any local (to a database) concurrency control mechanism (see technical summary). Since the CO property of a schedule is a necessary condition for global serializability of autonomous databases (in the context of concurrency control), it provides the only general solution for autonomous databases (i.e., if autonomous databases do not comply with CO, then global serializability may be violated). Seemingly by sheer luck, the CO solution possesses many attractive properties: #does not interfere with any transaction's operation, particularly neither block, restrict nor delay any data-access operation (read or write) for either local or global transactions (and thus does not cause any extra aborts); thus allows seamless integration with any concurrency control mechanism. #allows optimistic implementations (non-blocking, i.e., non data access blocking). #allows heterogeneity: Global serializability is achieved across multiple transactional objects with different (any) concurrency control mechanisms, without interfering with the mechanisms' operations. #allows modularity: Transactional objects can be added and removed transparently. #allows full ACID transaction support. #maintains each database's autonomy, and does not need any concurrency control information distribution (e.g., local precedence relations, locks, timestamps, or tickets). #does not need any knowledge about the transactions. #requires no communication overhead since it only uses already needed, unmodified atomic commitment protocol messages (any such protocol; using fault tolerant atomic commitment protocols and database systems makes the CO solution fault tolerant). #automatically resolves global deadlocks due to locking. #scales up effectively with computer network size and number of databases, almost without any negative impact on performance, since each global transaction is typically confined to certain relatively small numbers of databases and network nodes. #requires no additional, artificial transaction access operations (e.g., \\"take timestamp\\" or \\"take ticket\\"), which typically result in additional, artificial conflicts that reduce concurrency. #requires low overhead. The only overhead incurred by the CO solution is locally detecting conflicts (which is already done by any known serializability mechanism, both pessimistic and optimistic) and locally ordering in each database system both the (local) commits of local transactions and the voting for atomic commitment of global transactions. Such overhead is low. The net effect of CO may be some delays of commit events (but never more delay than SS2PL, and on the average less). This makes CO instrumental for global concurrency control of multidatabase systems (e.g., federated database systems). The underlying Theory of Commitment ordering,Yoav Raz (2009): Theory of Commitment Ordering - Summary GoogleSites - Site of Yoav Raz. Retrieved 1 Feb, 2011. part of Serializability theory, is both sound and elegant (and even \\"mathematically beautiful\\"; referring to structure and dynamics of conflicts, graph cycles, and deadlocks), with interesting implications for transactional distributed applications. All the qualities of CO in the list above, except the first three, are also possessed by SS2PL, which is a special case of CO, but blocking and constraining. This partially explains the popularity of SS2PL as a solution (practically, the only solution, for many years) for achieving global serializability. However, property 9 above, automatic resolution of global deadlocks, has not been noticed for SS2PL in the database research literature until today (2009; except in the CO publications). This, since the phenomenon of voting-deadlocks in such environments and their automatic resolution by the atomic commitment protocol has been overlooked. Most existing database systems, including all major commercial database systems, are strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL) based and already CO compliant. Thus they can participate in a CO based solution for global serializability in multidatabase environments without any modification (except for the popular multiversioning, where additional CO aspects should be considered). Achieving global serializability across SS2PL based databases using atomic commitment (primarily using two phase commit, 2PC) has been employed for many years (i.e., using the same CO solution for a specific special case; however, no reference is known prior to CO, that notices this special case's automatic global deadlock resolution by the atomic commitment protocol's augmented-conflict-graph global cycle elimination process). Virtually all existing distributed transaction processing environments and supporting products rely on SS2PL and provide 2PC. As a matter of fact SS2PL together with 2PC have become a de facto standard. This solution is a homogeneous concurrency control one, suboptimal (when both Serializability and Strictness are needed; see Strict commitment ordering; SCO) but still quite effective in most cases, sometimes at the cost of increased computing power needed relatively to the optimum. (However, for better performance relaxed serializability is used whenever applications allow). It allows inter-operation among SS2PL-compliant different database system types, i.e., allows heterogeneity in aspects other than concurrency control. SS2PL is a very constraining schedule property, and \\"takes over\\" when combined with any other property. For example, when combined with any optimistic property, the result is not optimistic anymore, but rather characteristically SS2PL. On the other hand, CO does not change data-access scheduling patterns at all, and any combined property's characteristics remain unchanged. Since also CO uses atomic commitment (e.g., 2PC) for achieving global serializability, as SS2PL does, any CO compliant database system or transactional object can transparently join existing SS2PL based environments, use 2PC, and maintain global serializability without any environment change. This makes CO a straightforward, natural generalization of SS2PL for any conflict serializability based database system, for all practical purposes. Commitment ordering has been quite widely known inside the transaction processing and databases communities at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) since 1990. It has been under company confidentiality due to patentingYoav Raz (1990): On the Significance of Commitment Ordering - Call for patenting, Memorandum, Digital Equipment Corporation, November 1990. Yoav Raz: US patents 5,504,899 5,504,900 5,701,480 processes. CO was disclosed outside of DEC by lectures and technical reports' distribution to database researches in May 1991, immediately after its first patent filing. It has been misunderstood by many database researchers years after its introduction, which is evident by the quotes above from articles in 1997-1998 referencing Commitment ordering articles. On the other hand, CO has been utilized extensively as a solution for global serializability in works on Transactional processes, Heiko Schuldt, Hans-J√∂rg Schek, and Gustavo Alonso (1999): \\"Transactional Coordination Agents for Composite Systems\\", In Proceedings of the 3rd International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium (IDEAS‚Äô99), IEEE Computer Society Press, Montrteal, Canada, pp. 321‚Äì331.

See more in The History of Commitment Ordering. Relaxing global serializability Some techniques have been developed for relaxed global serializability (i.e., they do not guarantee global serializability; see also Relaxing serializability). Among them (with several publications each): * Quasi serializabilityWeimin Du and Ahmed K. Elmagarmid (1989): \\"Quasi Serializability: a Correctness Criterion for Global Concurrency Control in InterBase\\" , Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB), August 22‚Äì25, 1989, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, pp. 347-355, Morgan Kaufmann, * Two-level serializability While local (to a database system) relaxed serializability methods compromise serializability for performance gain (and are utilized only when the application can tolerate possible resulting inaccuracies, or its integrity is unharmed), it is unclear that various proposed relaxed global serializability methods which compromise global serializability, provide any performance gain over commitment ordering which guarantees global serializability. Typically, the declared intention of such methods has not been performance gain over effective global serializability methods (which apparently have been unknown to the inventors), but rather correctness criteria alternatives due to lack of a known effective global serializability method. Oddly, some of them were introduced years after CO had been introduced, and some even quote CO without realizing that it provides an effective global serializability solution, and thus without providing any performance comparison with CO to justify them as alternatives to global serializability for some applications (e.g., Two-level serializability). Two-level serializability is even presented as a major global concurrency control method in a 2010 edition of a text-book on databases (authored by two of the original authors of Two-level serializability, where one of them, Avi Silberschatz, is also an author of the original Strong recoverability articles). This book neither mentions CO nor references it, and strangely, apparently does not consider CO a valid Global serializability solution. Another common reason nowadays for Global serializability relaxation is the requirement of availability of internet products and services. This requirement is typically answered by large scale data replication. The straightforward solution for synchronizing replicas' updates of a same database object is including all these updates in a single atomic distributed transaction. However, with many replicas such a transaction is very large, and may span several computers and networks that some of them are likely to be unavailable. Thus such a transaction is likely to end with abort and miss its purpose. Consequently, Optimistic replication (Lazy replication) is often utilized (e.g., in many products and services by Google, Amazon, Yahoo, and alike), while global serializability is relaxed and compromised for eventual consistency. In this case relaxation is done only for applications that are not expected to be harmed by it. Classes of schedules defined by relaxed global serializability properties either contain the global serializability class, or are incomparable with it. What differentiates techniques for relaxed global conflict serializability (RGCSR) properties from those of relaxed conflict serializability (RCSR) properties that are not RGCSR is typically the different way global cycles (span two or more databases) in the global conflict graph are handled. No distinction between global and local cycles exists for RCSR properties that are not RGCSR. RCSR contains RGCSR. Typically RGCSR techniques eliminate local cycles, i.e., provide local serializability (which can be achieved effectively by regular, known concurrency control methods); however, obviously they do not eliminate all global cycles (which would achieve global serializability).

Kincannon purposely hired new census enumerators (or census takers) for the then- forthcoming 2010 U.S. census from diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. He argued that employees who were familiar with different languages and ethnicities would produce a more accurate census count. Kincannon expressed pride of serving as Director of the Census Bureau, noting that past directors included Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams and Martin Van Buren, who had overseen the census as United States Secretary of State.

She received her early education in Pretoria. After matriculating from Pretoria Girls' High School she started work in 1939 as a cartographer in the Survey Department of the Witwatersrand Gold Mines. At the end of World War II, she moved to the Netherlands to study watercolour painting under the eye of her uncle Gerhardus Hilhorst, a distinguished natural history artist. Returning to South Africa, she worked in the advertising world as a freelance commercial artist in Cape Town and Johannesburg until her retirement in 1970 when she finally had the time to indulge her talents as a botanical artist. Since she always had a love and fascination for the genus Pelargonium, she set about illustrating all the known species. This massive project resulted in the publication of three volumes in 1977, 1981 and 1988. The entire collection of the original 314 water-colours and 160 habit sketches in pencil was acquired by the Brenthurst Library in Johannesburg in 1989. Completed plates of Pelargonium were found in her studio after her violent death.Art Experts, Inc. She was a prolific worker, finishing over 800 botanical watercolour paintings in 24 years. Other genera on which she worked included Sarcocaulon, Haemanthus, Rhus, Plectranthus, Hessea, Strumaria, as well as Gasteria, Serruria and Diascia. She was in great demand by botanists to illustrate plants from their particular fields of interest. 42 of her paintings were published in Fiowering Plants of Africa and she also made frequent contributions to Bothalia, Aloe, SA Journal of Botany, National Cactus & Succulent Journal, Cactus & Succulent Journal (USA) and Veld & Flora. Examples of her work are in the permanent collection of the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, Pittsburgh, USA., the Shirley Sherwood Collection as well as many important private collections. Awards and honours The Botanical Society of South Africa awarded her the Cythna Letty Medal in 1988: the South African Association of Botanists conferred the Certificate of Merit on her contribution to systematic botany and in 1990 she received a Gold Medal for the Haemanthus paintings at the Royal Horticultural Society Exhibition in London.

It premiered at the Humana Festival of New American Plays on 1991. The work has also been republished in several collections of modern American plays. Set in a dingy arena locker room in a Tennessee rust town, the story follows a collection of run-down female professional wrestlers and their blow-hard manager as they try to put on a card of matches and everything goes wrong.  Plot  In a dismal locker room, Dwayne, an autograph hound, is trolling around when Nola (a local fan and arena gopher girl) and Tiger (a road-weary ex-con) enter. He dives into the broom closet. Another wrestler, Dani comes in and rants about their typical treatment and money issues. Netty and Angelessa come in next. Dani runs down the line up for tonight's card, revealing that all of them will actually be playing several parts. Tiger sends Nola on a beer run for them. Big Man enters to run down the lineup. His brother Eddie had to be taken to the hospital the night before, and his best guess is a hooker assaulted him. Dani complains about the lack of pay, and Big Man slaps her. He then tells them since Eddie's out, the cruiserweight title match is off. Angelessa offers to do a mixed match. But despite her being a former Olympian, Big Man shoots it down. He tells them that he's called in The Knockout Sisters, a tag team of two sisters, who happen to live not too far away. The women aren't very happy, knowing that Big Man will be spending part of their pay for the extra wrestlers. As the ladies dress, they ponder over Eddie's fate. Suddenly, there's a thump from the broom closet. Angelessa opens the door and finds Dwayne hiding. He pleads for autographs but after they, including Nola, have signed his book, he starts preaching at them for being sinful whores. Angelessa grabs him and throws him out, but not before he can grab Tiger by her sore ribs, leaving her in even more pain. Before bell time, Big Man introduces Mother Crocker and her girls, The Knockout Sisters (Dolly and Dottie). They know little about actual wrestling, as their mother's guidance has gotten them this far. Dani and Tiger do the first match (Bloody Mary vs. Tarzana, Queen of the Jungle). It doesn't go very well and Tiger is in real pain. Angelessa and Netty are up next (as Black Lightning vs. Pajama Mama). When some guy in the crowd throws something at Angelessa, she leaves the ring and goes after him. Angelessa gets dressed as ‚ÄúOlympia‚Äù for her next match with Tiger. Mother steps in saying that she can't go out there and play the face (good girl) since she's black and the crowd is full of rednecks. Mother complains to Big Man. During the argument, Dolly pulls out a pistol to break it up. Willie \\"The Kid\\" Cayman, a former boxer pops in. He's touring the old arenas he fought in. He talks the girls up about the old days and how the fight game has changed. Mother convinces Dani to do a lingerie match for one hundred dollars. Nola volunteers to wrestle her. They return triumphant. The match not only went well, but they got tips from the crowd after the fight. The big tag-team match is finally ready to go. Dani and Nola (as Ninjas) will job a match (take a dive) for The Knockout Sisters. Angelessa snaps before the tag match starts. She locks Nola in the broom closet, and puts on Nola's Ninja costume. Before she can leave, Eddie arrives. He has come back for Angelessa, since it was she who injured him the night before. Meanwhile, the crowd boils into a riot. Dottie flees to the locker room, bleeding. Netty and Tiger tend to her. She says her sister was lost, swept up into the crowd. Angelessa re- enters the locker room, with Mother in a headlock. Despite Mother's bribe offers for her to stop, Angelessa hits her and trashes the room. Big Man storms in from the fray, furious at Angelessa for what she's done. Mother and Dottie make a run for it. Anglessa and Big Man brawl, but he eventually beats her down. Willie grabs Dolly's pistol and shoots Big Man in the leg to stop him. Dani, Nola, Netty and Anglessa run out the back to Willie's car. The raging crowd is now at the door. Willie calmly moves a locker set aside to reveal an old service tunnel leading out. Big Man and Eddie start to come to, but the mob outside is starting to bash down the old wooden door when the lights go out. Characters (In order of appearance in the play) * Dwayne Pardee ‚Äì Local character and autograph hound. Dwayne stalks any celebrities or near-celebrities that happen to come to Cementville. He keeps a large signature book that he says he plans to put into a time capsule for future generations. Dwayne, however, has some apparent mental issues combined from religious fervor and his idolizing of popular figures. That zeal can turn ugly. * Tiger ‚Äì A wrestling ring veteran and ex-con. Tiger (no other name known) has managed to survive in the wrestling business mostly due to her physical stature and ability to play a good heel (bad girl). Tiger, however, has been working so long that she almost constantly needs to numb her aching body with alcoholic beverages or other drugs. Tiger has little to care about, since she feels she has no other future, but she does take care of her little dog (no name given) and will back up her friends when push comes to shove ‚Äì if only her ribs weren't so sore. * Nola ‚Äì Local fangirl and wrestling wanna'be. Nola barely got through high school and so far only managed to work part-time or temp jobs at a local gas station and local factories, but she's always dreamed of being a big-time wrestling star. She wrestles with her bigger cousin, Jadine, for practice and can beat her in 'straight' wrestling. Nola has taught herself a lot of pro style moves but the psychology and drama of the ring seem to have escaped her and she has NO knowledge has the wrestling business really works. * Dani Malowski ‚Äì The wrestling troupe's diva, Dani is actually a trained and talented wrestler. But, she's overworked and underpaid since signing with Big Man's outfit. If it wasn't for her mouth and attitude, she might have actually made the big-time. Dani has no issue confronting her bosses, but at the same time she lets herself be abused and seeks comfort in the strange men she meets on the road. Dani often has to portray several characters in the same show, working more than one match to make up for the low talent pool in the company. * Angelessa or Lessa ‚Äì A former Olympian (shot putter) and college athlete, Lessa could never parlay her talents into a paying job. Probably hoping like W.W.E. and T.N.A. superstar Kurt Angle, she thought she could transition into wrestling. The problem for her is that she has the body and ability, but lacks the mental attitude for the wrestling game. She is a very proud young woman and finds it difficult to accept that she's merely entertainment now and must occasionally lose, not an actual competitor. She also has to deal with being the only African-American in the troupe and the attitude of rural fans to her as bad girl Black Lightning. * Netty ‚Äì The middle-age Alabama matron of the mats has done about every low- paying job out there. But, after trying her hand at working the ring, she's found she actually enjoys the job. Netty is a rose-colored glasses optimist, mostly due to the fact that she feels she has nothing else but the wrestling business now. She deals with the pain, the low pay and the low environments, since it gives her the chance to travel and be among the other women. Netty is bi-sexual, though she seems to prefer younger girls and has no qualms about it. Her demeanor, however, is that of a very genteel Southern gal who is just as pleased as punch to do anything asked of her. * Big Man Vag ‚Äì Raised in the fight world, Big Man started out as gopher and coffee boy in Joe Louis' Boxing Gym. He knows all about the fight game, having been involved in both boxing and wrestling but never could excel at either. His brother Eddie Vag did manage to elevate himself in the wrestling world and Big rode his coattails. As Eddie's career waned, Big Man formed a wrestling troupe and tour around him, being the company's booker (sets the fights and dates) and promoter. Big Mag adopted the ring persona of Irish Bob to be the foil to Eddie Stosha 'The Wild Man' Oronofsky. Outside the ring, Big is only somewhat capable of running his company and cannot handle real stress. He is also a recovering alcoholic. * Mother Crocker ‚Äì Formerly an owner of a small chain of car garages, Mother saw the explosion of pro wrestling on Pay Per View as a possible money-maker for her two young daughters (Dolly and Dottie) by turning them into the Knockout Sisters tag team. Giving the girls only some basic pro wrestling training, Mother pushed them onto every federation on their rise to stardom; which the girls did mostly on their backs in hotel rooms. She is a very formidable middle-aged woman, who smokes small cigars as she bulldozes her girls way to the top. Sadly, their run-in with the law was a setback to her long-term goal of getting the Knockouts into movies. * Dolly Crocker ‚Äì One half the Knockout Sisters, the scary half. The petite blonde may be a borderline sociopath, and has no compunction about threatening violence on those that get in her way. Like her sister, she has only passing wrestling skills in the ring; letting her looks and sexual favors move her career onwards. * Dottie Crocker ‚Äì Dottie looks more like a fitness model, being just under six feet tall with a lithe figure. She imagines herself as some kind of deep spiritual person, but she's as shallow as her kinfolk. She has no issue using sex to get what she wants, since she doesn't have any other real talent or skill. * Bobbie Jack 'One-Eye' Deanavue ‚Äì A warehouse worker from Lecher County, Kentucky. Bobbie Jack is a simple man. He works hard and he wants to play hard, but he is very critical if he's paying two-bits to see a show. He wants what he pays for and he has no issue using his favorite knife to get it. * Ms. Harmon ‚Äì Local girl and usherette at the Cementville Sportsdrome. Just out of her teens, Ms. Harmon had a two-week personnel training course and is more used to working regular sporting events and truck shows. She's not quite ready for the chaos that the Vixens of Violence Tour is bringing into her arena. * Willie 'Kid' Cayman ‚Äì Former middleweight boxer, long retired. Kid did the smart thing when he was still in the fight game, he saved his money and bought property in Florida. In his later years, he got a car and took to the road. He now travels to all the arenas he ever fought in and recalls the glory days of his youth. Kid is very spry older black man, managing to keep his very acute mental faculties, even after years of boxing. He comes across as a sweet old guy with a sharp memory, but he can still deal out the pain if the situation calls. * Eddie Vag ‚Äì Former W.W.W.F. wrestling star and known dirtbag. Eddie was once a top draw on the East Coast wrestling circuit, but his glory days are long past ‚Äì now they are filled with drugs and sex with groupies or local hookers. He has a horrible disposition and is very abusive to the women working in the locker room as an old-timer who worked around women wrestlers who doubled as escorts. He is prone to real violence due to his addictions.  Stage  The original production opened at the Humana Festival of New American Plays Humana Festival of New American Plays in 1991 at Actor's Theatre of Louisville, directed by Jon Jory. Since then, it has been performed in repertory theaters across the country.  Film  Screenwriter J.C. Young optioned Cementville for an independent feature film. At that time, the project had attached a director and wrestling consultant Dan Madigan, the screenwriter for See No Evil and a former WWE writer. Jessie Kresa, Gina Torres and Louis Gossett Jr had been approached to play major roles. Stunt Coordinator, Stuntwoman and former pro wrestler Deven MacNair was attached to play a role as well as choreograph. The film was originally picked up and greenlit by DIMI Entertainment, however, the company ceased business before the film could go into production.

Phosphogypsum refers to the calcium sulfate hydrate formed as a by-product of the production of fertilizer from phosphate rock. It is mainly composed of gypsum (CaSO4¬∑2H2O). Although gypsum is a widely used material in the construction industry, phosphogypsum is usually not used, but is stored indefinitely because of its weak radioactivity. The long-range storage is controversial.Ayres, R. U., Holmberg, J., Andersson, B., \\"Materials and the Global environment: Waste Mining in the 21st Century\\", MRS Bull. 2001, 26, 477. Somewhere between 100,000,000 and 280,000,000 tons are estimated to be produced annually as a consequence of the processing of phosphate rock for the production of phosphate fertilizers. Production Phosphogypsum is a side-product from the production of phosphoric acid by treating phosphate ore (apatite) with sulfuric acid according to the following reaction: :Ca5(PO4)3X + 5 H2SO4 \\\\+ 10 H2O ‚Üí 3 H3PO4 \\\\+ 5 (CaSO4 ¬∑ 2 H2O) + HX :where X may include OH, F, Cl, or Br Phosphogypsum is radioactive due to the presence of naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and their daughter isotopes radium, radon, polonium, etc. Marine-deposited phosphate typically has a higher level of radioactivity than igneous phosphate deposits, because uranium is present in seawater. Other components of PG are Cd (5-28 ppm), fluoride (ca 1%), and silica. =In the United States= Phosphogypsum stack located near Fort Meade, Florida. These contain the waste byproducts of the phosphate fertilizer industry. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has banned most applications of phosphogypsum having a 226Ra concentration of greater than 10 picocurie/gram (0.4 Bq/g). As a result, phosphogypsum which exceeds this limit is stored in large stacks. Central Florida has a large quantity of phosphate deposits, particularly in the Bone Valley region. However, the marine-deposited phosphate ore from central Florida is weakly radioactive, and as such, the phosphogypsum by-product (in which the radionuclides are somewhat concentrated) is too radioactive to be used for most applications. As a result, there are about 1 billion tons of phosphogypsum stacked in 25 stacks in Florida (22 are in central Florida) and about 30 million new tons are generated each year.Florida Institute of Phosphate Research. \\"Phosphogypsum and the EPA Ban\\" Last accessed June 19, 2007. Various applications have been proposed for using phosphogypsum, including using it as material for: *Artificial reefs and oyster beds *Cover for landfills *Road pavement *Roof tiles *Soil conditioner *Red mud, a comparable waste product, but from aluminium processing The United States Environmental Protection Agency approved the use of Phosphogypsum for road construction in 2020, saying that the approval came at the request of The Fertilizer Institute, which advocates for the fertilizer industry.

This law was signed by the President of the Republic, Ram√≥n Castilla, on April 25, 1861. The same Law divided the Province of Huamachuco in two, and created the Province of Otuzco. This law made the town of Otuzco the capital of the Province of Otuzco; it was later reincorporated as a city. Otuzco and its surroundings The Otuzcan area has been inhabited since the upcoming of the first human groups in the Region of La Libertad. It is an Andean city inhabited by descendants of the original inhabitants people of Peru, who have mixed with the people who came from Spain ever since the first years of Spanish domination. The majority are mestizo. It was inhabited by the Yungas and the Quechuas. Otuzco is a city in the La Libertad highlands with narrow streets and elevated houses of wide doors and tiled roofs. It is surrounded by the Andean landscape, which features the Tupullo Gorge, the Pollo River, and La Ermita mountain. Otuzco is much visited by religious pilgrims who come to pray to the Virgin de la Puerta (Virgin of the Gate), patron saint of the city. Throughout its history, Otuzco has been reclassified many times, first it was just a name, later it became a parish, then a \\"curato\\", later a town until the declaration of the Republic. When the Province of Otuzco was created, the town of Otuzco was raised to the legal category of \\"Villa\\" (town). Now, it has the category of city, by a Law published on November 15, 1890.

Throughout the mountains of Otuzco there are hundreds of dirt tracks, which are the primary transportation routes for the people who live in the small communities dotted throughout these mountains. Due to the mountainous terrain the main means of transportation for the people of these communities are donkeys; people and donkeys traverse these narrow, high mountain tracks every day as they go about their daily lives. Within a few kilometers of Otuzco the land changes from hard, rocky terrain to the warm, almost tropical fertile lower valleys that are famous for their year-round cultivation of pineapples and sugar cane. The festival of the Virgin De La Puerta The Virgin de la Puerta is the religious patron saint of Otuzco. The festival of the Virgin of La Puerta, celebrated in Otuzco during the second week of December, is one of the most important religious holidays in South America, and attracts thousands of devotees accompanying the statue of the Virgin during its journey through the streets. For a whole week, religious pilgrims of all ages walk the 73 kilometers from the city of Trujillo up through the mountains till they reach the city of Otuzco. The purpose of the pilgrimage is for believers to test their faith through the undertaking of this difficult journey. The festival consists of three nights of celebrations accompanied by fireworks, traditional hot air balloons, and more than twenty bands which play haunting traditional music. Highlights of the festival are the groups of dancers who dress as gypsies, African Slaves, pallas, coyas and devils. Another popular tradition is the race of the donkeys called \\"burrocross\\" where the men show their dexterity and control with their donkeys by racing through the streets and the mountain tracks in and around Otuzco.The week of festivities ends on 15 December when three-story-high bamboo castles of fireworks are lit. Economy The economy of Otuzco is based around wheat, potatoes, livestock and its traditional baked products. While a certain percentage of these products are sold within Otuzco, the remainder are transported to Trujillo where they are sold in the markets. Traditionally, once these products are sold, the proceeds are used to buy new products such as clothing, shoes, electrical goods, vegetables etc. which are then sold in the markets of Otuzco. As Otuzco is a small mountain community with a basic, self-sufficient economy, cash is the usual method of payment, there are no large banks or automated teller machines. Communication In recent years, Electricity, mobile phone towers and the internet have slowly spread throughout the mountain areas surrounding Otuzco. While there may be some areas without signal due to the mountains, mobile phone coverage is relatively widespread in and around the town and several internet cafes operate within Otuzco. Transportation to Otuzco The 1 to 2 hour journey to Otuzco starts from the city of Trujillo, the capital of La Libertad. Transportation to Otuzco includes regular buses, Micros (Small buses) and colectivos (Cars with individual paying passengers). The transportation ranges from low cost, basic buses to reasonably priced modern buses. The quickest method of transportation is colectivos but these can sometimes be the most dangerous as they generally travel at a higher speed through the winding mountain roads. All companies operating services to Otuzco leave from Avenida Union, a main road approximately 5 kilometers from downtown Trujillo. Once travellers arrive at Avenida Union, they just need to choose the company that they wish to travel with. The road to Otuzco is a modern, asphalt road that is generally well maintained. Tourism Otuzco is a traditional mountain community. Unlike Cuzco, which has been transformed into a commercial tourist destination, Otuzco has remained relatively traditional with people still going about their daily lives as they have for generations. It is 73 kilometers from the city of Trujillo, accessible by bus for a day trip. There are also several hotels. The primary charm of Otuzco lies in the traditional lifestyles and customs of the people; people are dressed in their colorful traditional clothing, selling their wares in the streets and markets, coaxing their donkeys along the roads and trails in a town where the majority of the buildings are still built the way they have been for centuries. Otuzco is surrounded by mountains and gorges. Education Education in Otuzco is mostly supplied by the state, although a few private schools and colleges have started to open up in recent years. Government education in Peru has not been good, once being called the worst in Latin America. In recent years the Peruvian economy has grown and been successful, and the government has increased its investment in education; this can be seen in small towns such as Otuzco where computers, books and materials are now being made available to children. The government has also invested heavily in the expansion, renovation and modernization of government schools in isolated communities such as those in and around Otuzco. There is little doubt that continued investment, both Government and private in Education will have a continued positive impact on the mountain populations. (mestizo).

Boxing career He was born in a Thai-Chinese family in Thailand and turned professional in 1987. The next year he fought Hiroki Ioka for the Lineal and WBC strawweight titles. The bout ended in a draw and in the rematch Kiatwanchai won the title by a twelve-round majority decision. He defended the title twice before losing to Jum-Hwan Choi on November 12, 1989. He beat future champion Rolando Pascua before challenging for the WBC title again, on June 8, 1990. He lost to champion Hideyuki Ohashi by a twelve-round unanimous decision. His final try at the title came in 1992, when Humberto Gonz√°lez knocked him out in defense of Gonz√°lez's WBC light flyweight title. Kiatwanchai stopped boxing in 1992 but made a comeback in 1996. He only won one fight during this comeback and retired for good in 2000. Here are some facts before Napa's first title contending match with Ioka:- Napa had only 6 professional fights, and never had an amateur fight before. Napa was expected to extend the age of the champ Hiroki Ioka, so, he was sent to Japan with his trainer Kunoi Withichai only 2 people. Napa was sent to canvas for an 8 count earlier, but after that kept opposing and hitting until half way of the 12 round when the champ Ioka was going to be Ko'd the bell suddenly rung so as to save the champ. Before the fight with Ioka, Napa's boxing name was Chokchaichew Na Pattaya, and the real Napa Kiatwanchai was actually another former IBF and WBC champion Muangchai Kittikasem, but Muangchai (or Napa at that time) was not ready to go, so, the manager put Chokchaichew in place of him, and since then he became Napa Kiatwanchai. After retirement his life has been difficult. He did not save any money because of lavish spending and gambling addiction. He now earns his living by singing along nightclub and restaurant. And he has problems with his vision, being blinded permanently as a result of the knocked by Gonz√°lez in 1992.

It is known only from subfossil bones, and probably became extinct shortly after Polynesians arrived in the Chathams about 450 years ago.  Discovery and description  Bones of crested penguins (genus Eudyptes) have been recorded from subfossil deposits on main Chatham Island for years. They had been identified as Fiordland penguin or erect-crested penguin, but Tennyson and Millener noted in 1994 they differed from both those species, and probably represented a species of crested penguin endemic to the Chathams. It was referred to as the \\"Chatham Island crested penguin\\", but not formally described and named. As part of a study of the recent evolution of numerous penguin species, subfossil bones from Chatham Island and the mainland had mitochondrial DNA fully extracted, sequenced, and compared to other species of Eudyptes. The Chatham bones differed sufficiently in their DNA to support the penguin's identity as a truly distinct species, and it was formally described in 2019 and named E. warhami, after John Warham, a pioneering researcher in penguin biology. Based on a comparison of mitochondrial genomes, this species diverged from its closest relative, the erect-crested penguin of the Antipodes Islands, between 1.1 and 2.5 million years ago. This corresponds to the emergence of the Chatham Islands from the sea about 3 million years ago.  Extinction  The Chathams were settled by Polynesians around 1450 AD, and E. warhami was probably hunted to extinction within 150‚Äì200 years along with many other bird species and one species of sea lion. It was almost certainly extinct before Europeans arrived at the Chathams. There has been a suggestion, however, the species persisted as recently as the late 19th century, because a crested penguin from the Chathams is recorded as being kept captive for several weeks around 1871 or 1872. Its species was noted as \\"Eudyptes pachyrhynchus\\", a name also used for E. sclateri and E. robustus at the time. Crested penguins are in fact regular, possibly even annual, visitors to the Chathams, and at least three species are recorded from there: Snares crested penguins (E. robustus), erect-crested penguins (E. sclateri), and rockhopper penguins (E. chrysocome), so the captured bird was likely one of these three. Bones of E. warhami have been identified from various subfossil and archaeological sites on mainland New Zealand, including the Wairarapa, Banks Peninsula, Marlborough, and Paekakariki areas. These likely represent stray birds from the Chathams arriving on the mainland, not breeding populations. Similarly, amongst the subfossil Eudyptes bones from the Chathams were E. sclateri, which also likely represent strays.

According to the Armenian chronicler Movses Khorenatsi (5th century), this land was the family estate of the Armenian Ordun dynasty, established by Armenian King Vagharshak, who ruled in 117 - 138/140 AD. In the story of the Armenian chronicler Favstos Buzand (5th century), the thief of the Orduni clan attacked the power of King Khosrov III, seizing and destroying the royal house, as a result of which the princes of the Orduni clan were killed by order of Khosrov. Their ancestral lands, located in the area of Basean, with all their bounds, were given to the bishop of Basean, a native of Ordor. After 428 AD this land became part of the Sasanian Armenia, right up to the Arab invasions in 7th-9th centuries. In 9th century Basean became part of Bagratid Armenia. In the 10th century, the border between the Byzantine Empire and expanding early georgian Kingdom of Tao-Klarjeti went along the Aras river, therefore part of northern Basean/Basiani became a domain of the Georgian Bagratids. In 1001, after the death of David Kuropalates, Basean/Basiani were inherited by Byzantine Emperor Basil II, who annexed the Armenian lands (Tayk/Tao, Basean/Basiani), captured by King David Kuropalates to Byzantium Cyril Toumanoff.

However, after formation of the Georgian Kingdom, Bagrat‚Äôs son George I inherited a longstanding claim to David's succession. While Basil was preoccupied with his Bulgarian campaigns, George gained momentum to invade Tayk/Tao and Basean/Basiani in 1014, which caused unsuccessful Byzantine-Georgian wars. Despite the territorial losses to Basil II, many of the territories ceded to the empire were conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the 1070s-1080s, but were then retaken by the Georgian King David IV. In the 13th century, at Battle of Basian, Georgians defeated the army of the Rum Sultanate. The province was part of the united Kingdom of Georgia as an ordinary duchy till 1545, when Basiani was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans made Hasankale the centre of a sanjak and entirely rebuild the citadel. They also built several mosques such as Ulucami (1554 repaired in 1836), Sivasli (1388 rebuild in 1912) Yeni (16th century rebuild in 1810) and baths. Other sights are the Coban bridge likely built in 1297 by a notable Ilkhanid Mongol named Coban and which was later restored several times. There are also two Islamic tombs nearby the town, Ferrah Hatun built in 1324 and the other likely in the 13th century. The nearby location of Avnik, has a ruined citadel with an old Muslim cemetery and mosque. During the 19th century, several Russo-Ottoman wars took place in this region and had as a consequence that many Armenians emigrated from this region towards Russian held territory in Transcaucasia. When World War broke out the Russians advanced to the plain of Pasinler but quickly retreated together with many of the local Armenian population, some 4,000 remained and were deported. Between 1915 and 1917 it was occupied by Russia and then held by the Armenians, who committed anti-Muslim atrocities in the region. During World War I some Armenians apparently broke the headstones of some old Islamic graves in Avnik. The Turkish army regained control of the town on 13 March 1918.

Jarboe's inclusion in the band marked a departure from their previous noise rock sound to a more melodic industrial and even folk rock sound. She also collaborated with Gira, forming their side project, The World of Skin in 1987, releasing several albums and singles. Jarboe left Swans in 1997 when the band broke up and embarked on a solo career, releasing various experimental records (many of which she has self-released and distributed over the internet) including Sacrificial Cake (1995) and Anhedoniac (1998). She has continued to self-release solo albums and, despite not returning to the group, recorded vocals for two tracks on the re-formed Swans' album, The Seer (2012). Jarboe completed a world tour in the autumn/winter of 2013, with Veil of Thorns' P. Emerson Williams on guitar.

WWII-era aerial view of NOLF Coupeville - 1943 History and usage Boeing EA-18G Growler on approach at Naval Outlying Field Coupeville during FCLP touch-and-go carrier landing practice NOLF Coupeville, also known as NOLF Coupeville, was commissioned for use by the US Navy in 1943. It currently supports day and night Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) operations by the US Navy's EA-18G Growler. Prior to the EA-18G being the only tailhook aircraft stationed at NAS Whidbey, the EA-6B Prowler, A-6 Intruder and the A-3 Skywarrior were also supported for carrier landing practice out of the OLF. Landing practice flight operations allow Naval Aviators and on-board crew to fly in patterns as well as practice touch- and-go landings, simulating carrier landings and take offs. During these practice runs, jet aircraft approach the runway and touch down where a simulated arrestor wire is painted on the deck. The jet then immediately takes off again and loops around the field to prepare for another landing and take off. Each aircraft makes multiple touch-and-go landings during these training events. While performing the touch and go maneuvers, the practicing aircraft fly at appropriate altitudes and speeds in addition to flying at or near sea level. OLF Coupeville is seen by the Navy as an ideal airfield for this type of carrier training due to its remote location and low ambient lighting, allowing pilots and crew to have the optimum experience for replication of landing aboard an aircraft carrier. Environmental concerns dB levels to areas surrounding NOLF Coupeville Jet noise has been an on and off concern to residents living near the Navy jet training field. In July 2013, a local citizens' group filed a lawsuit asking for an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) examining EA-18G Growler flight operations at NOLF Coupeville and NAS Whidbey Island. By 2014, the Navy had initiated an ongoing EIS to, \\"Evaluate the potential environmental effects associated with ongoing and future Growler operations at NAS Whidbey Island‚Äôs Ault Field and Outlying Landing Field (OLF) Coupeville.\\" In September 2013, the citizens' group placed the litigation on hold until the study was completed.. The study was completed in March of 2019 and approved an increase in OLF Coupeville use to 12,000 Touch-and-go landings per year at OLF Coupeville from the previous 3,000+ and \\"an increase from approximately 90 hours (1 percent of total hours per year) to 360 hours (4 percent of total hours per year) in aircraft activity at OLF Coupeville.\\"Record of Decision for the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for EA-18G ‚ÄúGrowler‚Äù Airfield Operations at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island Complex, Island County, Washington , US Department of the Navy, DoD, 12 March 2019, accessed 15 April 2019. The decision received mixed community reviews. At least one citizens' group opposed to the flight operations has publicly pledged to keep protesting the OLF's use. The protests have grown to a point where one group - Citizens of Ebey's Reserve - initiated litigation in US Federal District Court, as did the Washington State Attorney General's Office separately concerned about National Historic Preservation Act, National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act compliance..
